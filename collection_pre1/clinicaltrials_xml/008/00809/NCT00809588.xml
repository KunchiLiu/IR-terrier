	<brief_title>Vaccination With Autologous , Lethally Irradiated Melanoma Cells Engineered Adenoviral Mediated Gene Transfer Secrete Granulocyte-Macrophage Stimulating Factor ( GMSF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The vaccine create participant melanoma cell schedule give participant day 1 , 8 , 15 , 29 every two week supply vaccine run . The amount vaccine dependent total amount cell yield tumor process treat . It hop participant receive least six vaccine . - The vaccine administer two injection place underneath participant skin . The two injection give place body . - If tumor sample yield enough cell , participant also receive injection non-transduced irradiated melanoma cell . The purpose measure amount reaction participant immune system occur create vaccine . - If either vaccine site DTH placement site show reaction , punch-biopsy take . This consist small piece skin tissue remove local anesthesia . - With vaccine # 5 , participant receive second DTH injection . Two day vaccine DTH injection , punch biopsy take site . - At week 10 treatment ( earlier necessary ) , participant undergo chest , abdomen pelvic CT scan .
