	<brief_title>Bioavailability Metabolism Anthocyanins Following Acute Cranberry Consumption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Little know acute chronic pharmacokinetics metabolism anthocyanins consumed amount relevant usual dietary intake . Thus , hypothesize anthocyanins single oral dose cranberry juice absorb quickly measure circulation urine within 2-4 h. Further , anthocyanins undergo degree metabolism circulate well remove blood parent compound metabolic product . This research proposal submit independent sub-study exist project , `` Effects Cranberry Juice Endothelial Function Patients Coronary Artery Disease '' , conduct Joseph A. Vita , MD Boston University School Medicine sponsor Ocean Spray Cranberries , Inc . This study include 15 subject age 21-80 demonstrated endothelial dysfunction angiographically proven coronary artery disease receive single dose 480 mL cranberry juice . To test hypothesis study conduct HNRCA Tufts , utilize blood urine sample already collect store . We separate analyze anthocyanins sample HPLC determine pharmacokinetics relevant anthocyanins .</detailed_description>
