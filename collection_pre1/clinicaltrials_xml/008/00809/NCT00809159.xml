	<criteria>Patients moderate severe AS fulfil modify New York criteria diagnosis AS whose disease control NSAIDS ( least one NSAID period least 3 month maximum dose ) . Minimum disease activity inclusion patient assess base ASAS core set domain : back pain &amp; nocturnal pain score ≥ 4 despite concurrent NSAID use , PLUS BASDAI score ≥ 4 . Elevated CRP ESR mandatory study inclusion No evidence liver disease liver injury indicate abnormal liver function test serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT/AST ) , serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT/ALT ) , gamma glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ) , alkaline phosphatase , serum bilirubin . The investigator guide criterion outline exclusion criterion For patient previously treat TNF blocker , follow washout period require patient eligible participate trial : month washout period prior baseline alefacept month washout period prior baseline adalimumab certolizumab month washout prior baseline etanercept infliximab For patient previously treat immunosuppressive agent MTX , SSZ , systemic corticosteroid , 1month washout period prior baseline require . Immunosuppressive agent include limited cyclosporine , mycophenolate , tacrolimus , 5aminosalicylic acid ( 5ASA ) . Prednisone keep stable dose 4 week baseline throughout study exceed 10 mg/day . MTX keep stable dose 4 week baseline throughout study exceed 25 mg/week . SSZ keep stable dose 4 week baseline throughout study . In case previous leflunomide treatment , washout oral cholestyramine could consider alternative washout procedure increase elimination leflunomide . Based notion cholestyramine reduces plasma level active leflunomide metabolite approximately 40 % 24 hour 49 % 48 hour , cholestyramine give orally dose 8 g t.i.d . daily 10 day .
