	<brief_summary>This research do see PET scan obtain 3 cycle standard chemotherapy regimen help guide treatment patient blood disease call Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma . The standard treatment newly diagnose lymphoma 6 8 cycle chemotherapy like CHOP combination ( Cyclophosphamide , Doxorubicin , Vincristine , Prednisone ) . This regimen cure half patient lymphoma , many others disease relapse ( come back ) . Relapses generally treat chemotherapy . We believe PET scan ( type imaging study `` light '' area cell high activity lymphoma ) , may identify patient early high risk relapse . The purpose research study find people whose treatment change early intensification regimen ( high dose chemotherapy ) base positive PET scan long remission would receive high dose chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>R-ICE High-Dose Cyclophosphamide With PET/CT Diffuse Large B-Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive 3 cycle chemotherapy prior mid-treatment PET-CT. Rituximab-CHOP , equivalent regimen must use . During third cycle Rituximab-CHOP chemotherapy , PET-CT scan perform . The PET scan designate negative positive . Based result , patient either complete standard dose therapy receive two cycle R-ICE follow high dose cyclophosphamide rituximab . A repeat PET-CT require 4 6 week follow treatment completion . Patients followed-up every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month one year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
