	<brief_title>Thymidine Kinase 1 Risk Assessment Hereditary Breast /Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome associate mutation tumor suppressor BRCA1 BRCA2 gene . Products gene play important role repair DNA double-strand break . Mutations BRCA1 BRCA2 gene could impair DNA repair . In rest G1 cell , de novo synthesis DNA precursor absent , salvage pathway sole provider deoxyribonucleotides use DNA repair . For process sufficient supply deoxynucleotides activity Thymidine Kinase 1 essential . TK1 important component adaptive response cell DNA damage . Mutations gene directly engage DNA repair process could lead accumulation DNA damage turn cause adaptive cell reaction manifest permanently increase Thymidine Kinase 1 activity . A recently develop new high-sensitive assay DiviTum® allow investigate contribution enzyme DNA repair process make comparison Thymidine kinase 1 activity woman normal impared DNA repair system .</detailed_description>
