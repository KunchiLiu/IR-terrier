	<brief_summary>Thrombin potent activator platelet , platelet activation hallmark thrombosis . Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) major cause mortality morbidity United States industrialized country , thrombotic sequela key cause death diabetes . The accumulation thrombin sit vascular injury provide one major mechanism recruit platelet hemostatic plug . Thrombin work activation G protein-coupled protease activate receptor PAR1 PAR4 human platelet initiate signal cascade lead increase [ Ca ] , secretion autocrine activator , traffic adhesion molecule plasma membrane , shape change , promote platelet aggregation . The thrombin receptor work progressive manner , PAR1 activate low thrombin concentration , PAR4 recruit high thrombin concentration . As direct thrombin inhibitor become widely used clinical practice , important ass effect vascular function . Our hypothesis PAR1 PAR4 signal G protein pathway , PAR4 strong platelet agonist . To investigate hypothesis , investigator study G protein pathways downstream PAR4 , assess ex-vivo platelet responsiveness thrombin , PAR1 , PAR4 agonist peptide , normal human subject , along stage pathology , patient stable angina well unstable angina undergo angioplasty . Similarly , investigator examine platelet function patient metabolic syndrome well diabetes , along continuum insulin resistance full-blown disease . These study provide deep insight G protein pathway use PARs . They elucidate contribution PAR receptor normal platelet function well abnormal platelet activation thrombotic state . The long term goal understand implication PAR receptor therapeutic target anti-platelet therapy may carry less bleed risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Given known role proteases PARs coagulation , inflammation , pain , heal protection , need development PAR antagonist therapeutic agent treatment thrombosis , atherosclerosis inflammation well-recognized . Thus , block PAR action inhibit PAR-G protein interface alternative target block downstream consequence thrombin-mediated cellular activation . Since two PARs human platelet , PAR1 PAR4 , critical define role receptor several likely clinical setting PAR antagonist would use . In proposal G protein pathways underlie PAR signal mechanisms well roles pathology characterize activated platelet study detail . We propose grant investigate specific role individual PARs mediate event lead multi-stage process platelet activation clot formation . The long term goal study determine novel PAR-specific anti-platelet therapy . The 2002 estimate DHHS suggest 6.3 % population United States ( 18.2 Million people ) diabetes , estimate annual cost $ 132 Billion ( Centers Disease Control Prevention ) . The complication coronary artery cerebrovascular disease account 65 % deaths patient diabetes . The prevalence , complexity complication cardiovascular disease increase patient diabetes . This appear related frequent association diabetes insulin resistance traditional risk factor atherosclerosis . Recent study Haffner investigator establish concept diabetes coronary risk equivalent ; reflect guideline therapeutic target set ADA , AHA ACC . The clinical importance platelet activation reflect benefit aspirin clopidogrel GPIIbIIIa inhibitor diabetic . Epidemiologic data demonstrate metabolic syndrome associate increased incidence atherosclerotic event . Type 2 diabetes share many feature common metabolic syndrome , may represent precursor condition , Stern describe `` common soil hypothesis '' . Hsueh Law recently propose progression insulin resistance type 2 diabetes parallels progression endothelial dysfunction atherosclerosis . These study design study PAR signal G protein activation state patient platelet activation set continuum metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus . The degree platelet activation determine assay platelet reactivity expression marker platelet activation correlate change PAR signal . These study provide comprehensive assessment platelet activation set metabolic syndrome , compare extent activation set group contemporaneously study patient diabetes mellitus . Finally , influence direct thrombin inhibitor , bivalirudin platelet activation signal assess .</detailed_description>
