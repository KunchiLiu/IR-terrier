	<brief_summary>Purpose : This pilot study evaluate HIV viremia persistence acutely HIV infect antiretroviral naïve patient treat Darunavir/ritonavir Etravirine Participants : 20 participant , age 18 old , HIV infect , antiretroviral naïve patient Procedures ( method ) : ARV treatment Darunavir/ritonavir Etravirine , Optional study : Genital secretion sample , Cerebrospinal fluid sample , Leukapheresis , Endoscopy/colonoscopy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate HIV Viremia Persistence Acutely HIV-Infected ARV Naïve Patients Treated With Darunavir/Ritonavir Etravirine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This multicenter , single arm , 48-week open-label pilot study DRV/R &amp; ETR acute HIV infection . Study sit member Duke-UNC Acute HIV Infection Study Consortium . If baseline resistance detect treatment begin ( e.g . evidence pre-existing baseline resistance ( genotypic phenotypic ) may adversely affect efficacy study regimen ) , patient may elect alter treatment per best clinical practice . The new regimen provide study , obtain participant available clinical resource . After patient identify acute HIV infection , offer opportunity participate study . Patients also offer opportunity co-enroll CHAVI 001 012 , study follow virological immunological response patient AHI , regardless initiation ART . An overall consent form sign study participation , separate inform consent signature obtain optional study . Patients eligible participation sign overall consent - agree participate study compartment specimen require enrollment . At initial visit , patient eligibility confirm appropriate laboratory testing ( see `` STUDY POPULATION '' ) . When eligibility verify , entry laboratory study obtain , participant start DRV/r , ETR . All participant follow regular interval thereafter specify schedule evaluation . Participants meet criterion virologic failure offer opportunity switch best available regimen select HIV provider . Hypothesis Combination therapy DRV/R &amp; ETR suppress plasma viremia improve immunologic function antiretroviral ( ART ) -naïve , acutely HIV-infected ( AHI ) patient , limit replication HIV-1 cellular compartment .</detailed_description>

Calculated creatinine clearance ( CockcroftGault formula ) &gt; 30mL/min : CrCl = ( 140age ) x body weight ( kg ) ( x 0.85 female ) Serum creatinine [ mg/dL ] x ( 72 ) 13 . For woman reproductive potential , negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior initiate antiretroviral study medication . Reproductive potential define female reach menarche postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month , undergone surgical sterilization ( e.g. , hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , salpingotomy ) . Acceptable documentation surgical sterilization include patientreported history . 14 . If participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy , female study patient must use least one form contraception , could consist barrier method . All patient must continue use contraception 6 week stop study medication . Acceptable method contraception include : condom ( male female ) without spermicidal agent , diaphragm cervical cap spermicide , IUD . Female volunteer reproductive potential require use contraception . 15 . Ability willingness patient give write informed consent . 1 . Women pregnant breastfeeding . 2 . Women positive pregnancy test enrollment prior study drug administration . 3 . Women reproductive potential unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period 4 . Use immunomodulators ( e.g. , interleukin , interferon , cyclosporine ) , HIV vaccine , systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , investigational therapy within 30 day prior study entry .
