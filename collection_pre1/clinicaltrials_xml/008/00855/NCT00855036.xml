	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation Blunt Renal Injury Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current management blunt renal injury child base level 5 evidence , low score . Essentially , empiric decision therapy without physiologic rationale permeate generation teach . Patients therefore manage historical opinion , borrow principle spleen liver injury . Over past decade author agree non-operative management follow patient almost injury heal preservation renal function . However , oppose spleen liver injury , publish guideline non-operative management scheme . The kidney possess important anatomic physiologic difference compare intraperitoneal solid organ may allow distinct method management . Therefore , conduct retrospective review examine natural history injury identify potential recommendation management ( IRB 07 12-186X ) . In patient isolated renal injury ( n = 65 ) , mean length bedrest 3.8 +/- 1.9 day result mean length stay 3.8 +/- 3.1 day . There transfusion patient . There 3 patient readmitted discharge , 2 pain control , one new hematuria discharge . There 15 patient discharge persistent hematuria , none suffer long term sequela . Children release bedrest attending-specific manner wide array management schemes . Our data suggest risk significant hemorrhage blunt renal trauma low . Further , clearance hematuria may good marker therapy . Therefore , period bedrest serial blood urine monitoring may justify , clearly role prospective application single management protocol validate least one protocol institution follow . In retrospective data , find one patient develop intermittent hypertension . However , identify one patient require hypertension document medical record , mean may miss patient manage pediatrician . More concerning may miss patient hypertension . These potential patient may get well adulthood hypertension detect study imperative define natural history renal healing , quantify risk hypertension , potentially identify predictor complication . The management protocol currently follow propose study include one night bedrest patient may ambulatory next day . From point , patient manage hospital meet general discharge criterion . Discharge criterion adequate pain control oral pain medication tolerate regular diet .</detailed_description>
