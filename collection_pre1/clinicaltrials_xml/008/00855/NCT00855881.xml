	<brief_title>Metronomic Chemotherapy With Tegafur/Uracil Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) ( exclude nasopharyngeal cancer ) account 4 % 5 % cancer incidence Taiwan.1 Localized disease curable surgery irradiation . Two-thirds patient present advanced stage disease ( stage III IV ) , treat multimodality therapy , include surgery , radiation chemotherapy . Despite achievement complete response patient receive multimodality therapy , however , recurrence might occur patient within two year multimodality therapy . HNSCC regard chemosensitive tumor since early 1980s.Cisplatin-based combination therapy fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) common chemotherapy regimen patient HNSCC . Concomitant chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) conceptually support natural history head neck cancer , indicate primary need improve locoregional therapy secondary need improve systemic therapy . CCRT frequently study inoperable patient unresectable disease4 . Several recent study meta-analyses indicate superior locoregional control and/or survival rate CCRT compare radiotherapy alone3-12 . `` Two similar , large-scale , prospective randomize independent trial design European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) conduct evaluate role concurrent administration cisplatin radiation postoperative treatment high-risk head neck tumor . The EORTC ( # 22931 ) 29 study reveal combination therapy efficacious radiotherapy alone patient locally advanced head neck cancer treatment cause undue number late complication . The RTOG ( # 9501 ) 30 trial find postoperative CCRT significantly improve rate local regional control disease-free survival high-risk patient resect head neck cancer ; however , combine treatment associate substantial increase adverse effect . Multimodality therapy may achieve high complete response rate patient locally advanced HNSCC , however , patient still face high recurrent rate might decrease survival time . For reason , development reliable method ( example ) metronomic therapy prevent relapse locally advance setting may improve outcome treatment . Uracil-tegafur ( UFT ) , oral fluoropyrimidine prodrug , available commercially Japan several country . It compose 1- ( 2-tetrahydrofuryl ) -5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) ( FT ; also ftorafur tegafur ) uracil molar ratio 1:4 . FT readily absorb gut without degradation convert liver 5-FU subsequently degrade 2-fluoro-b-alanine . Thus , UFT share chemotherapeutic mechanism action 5-FU . The 5-FU metabolite FdUMP bind inhibits enzymatic activity thymidylate synthase ( TS ) , thereby inhibit DNA synthesis.13-17 Uracil strongly inhibit degradation 5-FU 2-fluoro-b-alanine competitive inhibition dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) , rate-limiting enzyme metabolism 5-FU.18,19 This alteration 5-FU disposition seem tumor selective . When take orally , UFT FT give comparable distribution 5-FU blood normal tissue , UFT result 5-10 time great distribution 5-FU tumors.20 Co-administration uracil and/or FT , therefore , enhance anti-tumor activity FT.21 The cytotoxic effect 5-FU ( , thus , FT ) enhance markedly sufficient amount reduce folate cofactor , leucovorin ( LV ) , present . Cellular folate pool consider important biochemical determinant FdUMP enzyme binding.22-28 One basic study show mouse bear RENCA tumor , tegafur/uracil treatment result significant prolongation life span , associate inhibition angiogenesis . This recomposed . For example , `` Tegafur/uracil treatment mouse RENCA tumor show inhibit angiogenesis , lead significant prolongation life span.Two metabolite tegafur/uracil , namely , GHB33,34 GBL find responsible effect . In another study , formation cancer vasculature , essential initiation metastasis inhibition tumor angiogenesis , one target tumor dormancy therapy . The efficacy tegafur/uracil postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrate several clinical trial . The basic data study indicate possible contribution anti-angiogenic activity tegafur/uracil overall anti-tumor activity , think mediate cytotoxic effect 5-FU . Thus , tegafur/uracil seem particularly useful chronic postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy regimen control metastasis . Lam et31al . conduct prospective randomize study post-operative chemotherapy levamisole UFT treatment head neck carcinoma . A trend towards well distant control post-operative oral chemotherapy observe . The side effect minimal . Masato Fujii also report adjuvant chemotherapy UFT efficacious treat maxillary sinus carcinoma . The 5-year survival 76.2 % UFT group 17.9 % control group32 . Metronomic chemotherapy refers close , regular administration chemotherapeutic drug , prolong period , extend drug-free break periods38 . As , form `` dose dense '' chemotherapy differs form latter several ways35,36 . First , `` dose intense '' goal remain deliver high , toxic level drug short period time . Second , metronomic regimen much less toxic , usually require supportive growth factor , supportive care measures39,40 . Metronomic chemotherapy thus view form efficiently , low dose , long term 'maintenance ' chemotherapy use own36,38 , importantly , combine long-term biologic target therapy , especially antiangiogenic drug anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies41 small molecule multi-targeted VEGFR-2 antagonist receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors42 . It also integrated standard MTD-type ( maximum tolerate dose ) chemotherapy brief course therapy , 'upfront ' , follow long-term maintenance metronomic chemotherapy combine concurrent target therapies41,42 , call `` chemo-switching '' 40 . The advantage metronomic chemotherapy include reduce acute toxicity , high grade myelosuppression , vomit , nausea , mucotitis , 39,40 sometimes surprisingly good activity drug resistant tumors38 , reduce cost use patent chemotherapeutic drug , increase convenience use oral drug take home36,39 . These potential advantage could useful long term adjuvant therapy early stage cancer , e.g . long-term daily oral administration drug UFUR ( UFT ; 5-FU prodrug ) 1~2 year breaks43,45,46,50 . The reason standard chemotherapy , use maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , separate long 2-3 week drug-free break period effective antiangiogenic treatment regimen damage inflict upon divide endothelium cell tumor largely reverse extend drug-free break period , perhaps massive hemopoiesis-like mobilization ( 'rebound ' ) CEPs home damage tumor endothelium set repair damage44 . Thus shorten break period critical ensure repair process prevent minimized38 . This turn require relatively low dos drug used38 . The anti-tumor effect single versus two chemotherapeutic drug combination , dose administer metronomic fashion , i.e. , daily ( oral delivery ) model advanced high volume ( end stage ) visceral metastatic disease therapy initiate terminal stage disease47 . Metronomic chemotherapy regimen combine antiangiogenic drug move phase II clinical trial test adjuvant metastatic setting . Some interim result phase II clinical trial involve metastatic breast cancer advance , recurrent ovarian cancer look extremely promising48,49,50 . Ongoing , plan recently complete phase II clinical trial metronomic chemotherapy combine agent bevacizumab thalidomide indicate whether treatment strategy promise treatment metastatic and/or early stage human cancer . Although low-dose cytotoxic drug combine targeted agent may potential benefit explain previously . There remain several significant challenge must overcome increase success clinical setting . Foremost among current empiricism associate try determine optimal dose schedule administration chemotherapeutics . The challenge lie find small dose control growth target cell frequent dose maximize control . discovery application functional surrogate marker might one solution overcome problem metronomic-dose determination , determine So , detect change level circulate TSP1 level serum plasma administration various low dos chemotherapeutics might useful determine optimal low dose drug cyclophosphamide51 . In addition TSP1 level , important approach determine optimal metronomic low dose give metronomic chemotherapy regimen evaluation activity CEPs circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) . As previously discuss , CEPs mobilization bone marrow peripheral circulation strongly inhibit low-dose cyclophosphamide , CEP viability52 . It might confer could direct relationship relative efficacy different ( low ) dose metronomic chemotherapy ability dose reduce level CEPs peripheral circulation . In study Shaked et al. , use 4 distinct metronomic chemotherapy regimens 4 different preclinical tumor model establish optimal biological dose ( OBD ) without cause excessive toxicity demonstrate OBDs tumor model strikingly correlate maximum reduction CEPs53 . The result study suggested result suggest CEPs may serve pharmacodynamic biomarker determine OBD metronomic chemotherapy regimen . It understanding combination clinical trial laboratory cellular/molecular assay relevant current promising mainstream , translational research .
