	<brief_summary>Treatment locally-advanced rectal adenocarcinoma include preoperative radiochemotherapy surgery total mesorectal excision order reduce tumor infiltration , facilitate oncologic surgery improve survival . About fifty percent patient good responder i.e . tumor infiltration reduces rectal wall regional lymph node order grade ypT0 T2 N0 pathologic assessment ( call downstaging ) . At opposite , bad responder ( ypT3-4 and/or N+ ) sensitive standard preoperative radiochemotherapy , survival poor good responder . Until , response preoperative radiochemotherapy anticipate pathological assessment surgical specimen . Proteomic analysis serum good bad responder preoperative radiochemotherapy could allow identification early biomarkers tumor response , subsequently adaptation treatment increase preoperative treatment efficiency survival patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proteomic Approach Using Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Tandem Time-of-flight ( MALDI-TOF/TOF ) Tumor Response Rectal Carcinoma After Radiochemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Good bad responder preoperative radiochemotherapy locally-advanced rectal adenocarcinoma anticipate pathological assessment rectal specimen . The purpose prospective monocentric study look early seric biomarkers predictive tumor response ( good bad responder ) patient treat preoperative radiochemotherapy ( 45 Gy ) rectal adenocarcinoma use proteomic approach . All patient locally-advanced rectal adenocarcinoma enrol . Sequential sample sera collect , preoperative treatment surgery , analyse use MALDI-TOF-TOF method . Proteomic analysis correlate pathological response order identify potential early biomarkers tumor response .</detailed_description>
