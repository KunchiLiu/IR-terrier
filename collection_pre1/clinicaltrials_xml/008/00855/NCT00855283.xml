	<brief_summary>DWE ( difficulty evacuation ) common important quality life issue spinal cord injury . Not management DWE time-consuming unpleasant , result often suboptimal term complication incontinence impaction . Bowel care regimens spinal cord injury change significant fashion many year . The usual strategy attain bowel evacuation involve dietary manipulation ( e.g. , high fiber diet hydration ) , thrice weekly laxative administration ( senna cascara ) thrice weekly anorectal instillation cathartic ( enemas suppository ) . Bowel care quite time consuming ( great 2 hour many instance ) may also require extensive nursing care . Finally , incomplete evacuation could contribute fecal incontinence significant morbidity patient . In preliminary study perform JJPVAMC , IV , IM , subcutaneous injection neostigmine combine glycopyrrolate demonstrate highly effective promote bowel evacuation SCI population . In effort provide realistic administration procedure , propose test intranasal spray injection neostigmine glycopyrrolate safety efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We study effect spinal cord injury bowel ten year . Our data suggest one fundamental consequence spinal cord injury slow intestinal peristaltic activity , likely result regulation parasympathetic neural pathway . Furthermore , measure increase parasympathetic stimulation bowel result bowel evacuation improve bowel care . In respect , significant acute effect demonstrate intravenous administration cholinergic agent neostigmine ( Am J Gastro 100:1560-5 , 2005 ) . Long term efficacy also show use intramuscular administration neostigmine ( Gastro 128 : P258 , 2005 ) . Subcutaneous administration neostigmine progress time . Bowel evacuation also facilitate subcutaneous administration often require second dose ( 30 minute first ) . This observation likely due decrease rate absorption tissue compartment correspondingly low peak level neostigmine ( vide infra ) . Given potential cardiopulmonary toxicity neostigmine ( bradycardia bronchoconstriction ) , neostigmine administer study combination anticholinergic agent glycopyrrolate . We report latter selectively block cardiopulmonary side effect neostigmine without significantly decrease prokinetic peristaltic response . In summary , data date indicates combine administration neostigmine glycopyrrolate safe spinal cord damage result predicable prompt bowel evacuation .</detailed_description>
