	<brief_summary>Thrombin potent activator platelet , platelet activation hallmark thrombosis . Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) major cause mortality morbidity United States industrialized country , thrombotic sequela key cause death diabetes . The accumulation thrombin sit vascular injury provide one major mechanism recruit platelet hemostatic plug . Thrombin work activation G protein-coupled protease activate receptor PAR1 PAR4 human platelet initiate signal cascade lead increase [ Ca ] , secretion autocrine activator , traffic adhesion molecule plasma membrane , shape change , promote platelet aggregation . The thrombin receptor work progressive manner , PAR1 activate low thrombin concentration , PAR4 recruit high thrombin concentration . As direct thrombin inhibitor become widely used clinical practice , important ass effect vascular function . Our hypothesis PAR1 PAR4 signal G protein pathway , PAR4 strong platelet agonist . To investigate hypothesis , investigator study G protein pathways downstream PAR4 , assess ex-vivo platelet responsiveness thrombin , PAR1 , PAR4 agonist peptide , normal human subject , along stage pathology , patient stable angina well unstable angina undergo angioplasty . Similarly , investigator examine platelet function patient metabolic syndrome well diabetes , along continuum insulin resistance full-blown disease . These study provide deep insight G protein pathway use PARs . They elucidate contribution PAR receptor normal platelet function well abnormal platelet activation thrombotic state . The long term goal understand implication PAR receptor therapeutic target anti-platelet therapy may carry less bleed risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Thrombin major protease coagulation cascade whose pleiotropic action ultimately lead thrombosis tissue injury . Thrombin key effector coagulation cascade convert fibrinogen fibrin essential lay mesh work clot formation . Further , thrombin also provide positive feedback convert inactive coagulation factor active state , thereby generate thrombin . In addition , thrombin display diverse range effect vascular cell functionally connect tissue damage hemostatic inflammatory response . Many cellular effect thrombin initiate via activation family Protease-Activated Receptors ( PARs ) couple heterotrimeric G protein . Cardiovascular disease remain leading cause death United States , account 39 % deaths $ 350 billion annual health care cost country . Current pharmacological therapy treatment disease cause blood clot , heart disease stroke , often involve use drug reflect current scientific understanding pathology . Acute coronary syndrome thrombotic event , platelet activation play critical role formation intravascular thrombus site arterial injury plaque rupture . Medical management acute coronary syndrome center anti-platelet therapy , however , current anti-platelet drug fully attenuate platelet activation , delayed onset long duration action may result significant morbidity due bleeding complication . With increase number percutaneous coronary intervention patient ACS , bleed complication become major concern new era anti-platelet coagulation therapy . The direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin associate significant reduction in-hospital bleeding complication compare heparin plus IIbIIIa inhibitor patient undergo PCI , composite clinical endpoint ( death , MI , repeat revascularization ) maintain . An explanation lack superiority direct thrombin inhibitor compare heparin , could direct thrombin inhibitor also block anticoagulation anti-inflammatory effect thrombin thereby potentially alter risk/benefit ratio . In addition , agent use treat ACS undesirable side effect bleed . An agent would selectively block inflammatory thrombotic effect thrombin selectively block PAR activation , without alter protective APC pathway inhibit fibrin generation ( bleed ) would potentially desirable risk/benefit ratio . Given known role proteases PARs coagulation , inflammation , pain , heal protection , need development PAR antagonist therapeutic agent treatment thrombosis , atherosclerosis inflammation well-recognized . Thus , block PAR action inhibit PAR-G protein interface alternative target block downstream consequence thrombin-mediated cellular activation . Since two PARs human platelet , PAR1 PAR4 , critical define role receptor several likely clinical setting PAR antagonist would use . In proposal G protein pathways underlie PAR signal mechanisms well roles pathology characterize activated platelet study detail . We propose grant investigate specific role individual PARs mediate event lead multi-stage process platelet activation clot formation . The long term goal study determine novel PAR-specific anti-platelet therapy . In define G protein mediate effect different PARs platelet , target particular receptor-G protein interface use C-terminus particular G alpha mediate response . We use overexpression native C-terminal peptide different G proteins determine G protein signal pathway involved physiological response endothelial cell . As method applicable platelet , transfectable , propose create membrane-permeable version Gα C-terminal peptide would acutely deliverable platelet tease signal pathway . The role G proteins platelet activation mouse study extensively use knockout technology . The striking phenotype mouse lack G alpha q . They demonstrate absence platelet aggregation protect thromboembolism . Recently , role G alpha 13 platelet uncover use inducible mouse line lack G alpha 13 . Previously role G alpha 13 unknown mouse die utero defect angiogenesis . Surprisingly , absence G13 mouse platelet lead reduced potency thrombin , TXA2 collagen induce platelet shape change aggregation . The specific role G proteins platelet activation human less well study , lack tractable genetic approach inability transfect human platelet . One study identify patient diminished Gαq activity ( 50 % Gαq immunoreactivity compare normal ) also impair agonist-induced platelet aggregation secretion . Significant difference exist expression pattern G proteins PARs mouse human platelet . Perhaps big difference thrombin activation mouse platelet mediate PAR3 PAR4 , thrombin activation human platelet mediate PAR1 PAR4 . This make clear thrombin still able activate platelet PAR1 knockout mouse . Murine PAR3 unable signal downstream effector function present thrombin PAR4 platelet , PAR4 lack hirudin-like sequence bind thrombin efficiently . By contrast , human PAR3 propose signal thrombin-triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis , however , functional role remain establish . Mice platelet express Gαq express Gα11 , likely explain severe phenotype Gαq knockout mouse compare knockout mouse . However , human platelet may contain G alpha 11 , addition G alpha q , although view controversy . Our dominant-negative G protein peptide strategy allow u directly study PAR-G protein signal human platelet . Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) lead cause death world . The lifetime risk coronary heart disease age 40 49 % men 32 % woman . The AHA estimate 12 million people form CAD history . This increase age baby boom generation . Research span nearly three decade firmly establish role platelet activation pathophysiology ACS . In contrast central role platelet activation pathogenesis unstable angina acute myocardial infarction , major role platelet activation set chronic stable angina widely acknowledge . Coronary angioplasty lead vessel wall injury exposure subendothelial structure resultant platelet activation may limit early late success procedure . In contrast finding patient stable angina , patient refer angioplasty exhibit consistent increase platelet activation prior intervention . Platelet aggregation expression activate GPIIbIIIa P-selectin increase patient refer coronary artery stenting angioplasty . In contrast , increase concentration circulate marker platelet activation patient follow angioplasty report group . Based REPLACE-2 trial bivalirudin , interventional cardiologist Vanderbilt around world increasingly use bivalirudin anticoagulant choice PCI . We examine effect block thrombin PAR signal platelet subject normal coronary artery well patient undergo PCI . We carry preliminary study platelet aggregation bivalirudin infusion patient Vanderbilt 's Coronary Catheterization Laboratory . As expect , thrombin mediate aggregation ex vivo platelet inhibit bivalirudin ( data show ) . Therefore , hypothesize remove protective effect basal thrombin vasculature could change platelet PAR1 PAR4 signal state . This possibility examine , important study conduct , direct thrombin inhibition become widely use therapeutic strategy acute coronary syndrome . These study design study PAR signal G protein activation state patient platelet activation set continuum metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus . The degree platelet activation determine assay platelet reactivity expression marker platelet activation correlate change PAR signal . These study provide comprehensive assessment platelet activation set metabolic syndrome , compare extent activation set group contemporaneously study patient diabetes mellitus . Finally , influence direct thrombin inhibitor , bivalirudin platelet activation signal assess .</detailed_description>
