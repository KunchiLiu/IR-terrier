	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics Safety Study Rabeprazole New Born Infants With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease ( GERD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center Phase I study newborns pre-term infant ( less 44 week time first dose ) . The drug study rabeprazole sodium , active pharmaceutical ingredient AcipHex . This study consist two part , Part 1 Part 2 . Each part consist three phase , pre-treatment phase ( screen 7 day start treatment ) , treatment phase ( 28 day ) post treatment phase ( least 14 day , 21 day last dose study drug ) . The maximum study length patient therefore 8 week . Patients monitor patient presumptive diagnosis GERD need feed tube enteral alimentation ( complete partial ) place admit newborn intensive care unit step unit . The population pharmacokinetics ( PK ) result together pharmacodynamics ( ie , pHmetry ) data , safety tolerability data Part 1 assess determine two dose level study Part 2 start dosing . Pharmacokinetics explore drug absorb body , distribute within body , remove body time . Pharmacodynamics ( PD ) study action effect drug body . All patient Part 1 require pH monitor clinical management undergo 24-hour PD assessment ( intraesophageal intragastric pHmetry ) . At least 12 patient Part 2 ( least 6 patient dose group ) require pH monitoring undergo PD assessment patient Part 1 . Patients participate pHmetry assessment must need assessment clinical management opinion Principal Investigator . The intraesophageal intragastric 24-hour pH PD assessment Part 1 Part 2 perform baseline ( Day -1 ) first dose ( Day 1 ) fifth dose ( Day 5 ) . Sampling single dose blood level PK evaluation perform post-dose Day 1 . Sampling blood level evaluation presume steady-state multiple dosing perform Day 5 . Patients ' safety monitor throughout study . At end study , patient prematurely discontinue his/her participation study , safety evaluation perform least 14 day , 21 day , final rabeprazole sodium dose . During course study , consent patient medical history , physical , length , weight , vital sign , blood chemistry , urinalysis . Safety baseline End Study visit ( post-treatment phase ) evaluate examine incidence , severity relationship study drug type Adverse Events ( AEs ) , urinalysis , physical examination vital sign . Patients receive rabeprazole sodium single daily dose 28 consecutive day . Patients participate Part 1 receive 1.0 mg rabeprazole sodium administer nasogastric tube . After four patient complete Part 1 , rabeprazole plasma level assess dose may increase 2.0 mg rabeprazole sodium . The population PK result , together PD ( ie , pHmetry ) data , safety tolerability data Part 1 assess determine 2 dos Part 2 .</detailed_description>
