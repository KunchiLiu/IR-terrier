	<brief_title>Knee Alignment Contributions Anterior Cruciate Ligament ( ACL ) Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite intense study anterior cruciate ligament injury past three decade , mechanisms injury clearly define . A recent study Principle Investigator identify difference leg alignment single leg land sport activity result torn ACL ( provocative versus control alignment , respectively ) . The purpose study quantify tibiofemoral alignment lateral compartment knee provocative landing position control land position . order elucidate possible mechanism ACL injury Material Methods : 25 normal control recruit great Washington DC population . Magnetic resonance image sagittal plane acquire single leg subject . These image cover lateral compartment knee acquire leg three position , one emulate injury position , one exagerrates injury position , one emulate control land position . Statistical analysis measurement provocative , exagerrated provocative , control position perform . These insight could apply improve train focused reduce incidence ACL rupture ; improve bracing design help athlete risk ACL rupture recover ACL injury/surgery ; improve ACL replacement surgery .</detailed_description>
