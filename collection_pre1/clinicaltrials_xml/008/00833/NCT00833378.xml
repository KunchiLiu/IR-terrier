Clotting factor abnormality associate hypercoagulability , specifically Factor V Leiden , Protein C Protein S deficiency antithrombin III deficiency . 5 . Elevated blood pressure ( BP ) screening ( systolic &gt; 140 mm Hg , diastolic &gt; 85 mm Hg ) . If subject 's BP elevate first measurement , complete two additional BP measurement 2 minute apart average three assessment evaluate criterion . If average BP exceed safety criterion , subject exclude . 6 . History atrial fibrillation , mitral valve prolapse , significant heart murmur vascular bruit . 7 . Prolonged QTc interval ( Bazett 's ) screening ( female &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 430 msec ) . If QTc interval prolong initial ECG , complete two additional ECGs 5 minute apart take average QTc measurement three ECGs evaluate criterion . If average QTc exceed safety criterion , subject exclude . 8 . Female subject currently receive hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) . 9 . Positive HIV , hepatitis B virus hepatitis C virus assay screen . 10 . Positive urine drug screen include alcohol screen predose ( Day 1 ) . 11 .
