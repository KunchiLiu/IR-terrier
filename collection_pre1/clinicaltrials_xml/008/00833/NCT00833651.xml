	<brief_summary>Influenza ( Flu ) vaccine recommend kidney transplant patient least 6 month post-transplant . The influenza vaccine stimulate immune system build protective antibody flu virus . Previous research show adult kidney transplant patient able form much protective antibody compare healthy volunteer . Research also suggest different immunosuppressive medicine may different effect antibody formation . In study , hope evaluate difference detail . In recent year , increasingly effective , also increasingly complex , immunosuppressive regimen develop , however , little detailed systematic study immune change occur response vaccination newer immunosuppressive regimens.Current policy vaccination transplant recipient generic continue base old concept rather new understanding effect new therapy immune system . We hope improve understanding effect immunosuppressive regimen use today ( calcineurin-inhibitor , CNI , sirolimus-based regimen ) immune response flu vaccine . Such knowledge critical help clinician develop strategy get desirable immune response cause rejection .</brief_summary>
