	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine maximum tolerate dose effectiveness study drug ( CC-4047 ) Alone Or Combination With Low-dose Dexamethasone treatment patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MTD , Safety , Efficacy Pomalidomide ( CC-4047 ) Alone With Low-dose Dexamethasone Patients With Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Phase 1 segment study design determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) single-agent pomalidomide , determine first cycle treatment . Following completion first cycle , participant allow continue study assign dose pomalidomide . Participants develop progressive disease ( PD ) time , achieve least 25 % reduction serum myeloma ( M ) -protein level ( measurable ) 50 % reduction urine M-protein ( measurable ) compare baseline completion 4 cycle pomalidomide , option receive oral dexamethasone 40 mg day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day treatment cycle addition current dose pomalidomide . Participants PD choose add dexamethasone pomalidomide therapy discontinue study . Participants choose add dexamethasone allow continue study treatment PD develop , unacceptable toxicity participant withdraw consent , time discontinue . Based result phase 1 portion , Data Monitoring Committee confirm 4 mg/day MTD pomalidomide . Therefore , recommend start dose pomalidomide Phase 2 4 mg/day Days 1-21 28-day cycle . In combination treatment arm , start dose dexamethasone 40 mg per day . For subject &gt; 75 year age , start dose dexamethasone 20 mg per day . To prevent blood clot , participant give aspirin 81-100 mg daily ( commercial supply ) unless contraindicate . If contraindicate , another form anti-thrombotic therapy provide . Participants Phase II combination treatment arm could continue study treatment PD develop , time discontinue . Participants single agent pomalidomide treatment arm develop PD , confirm IRAC , time option receive oral dexamethasone addition current dose pomalidomide start dose describe . Participants PD choose add dexamethasone pomalidomide therapy discontinue study treatment . Participants choose add dexamethasone pomalidomide therapy could continue study treatment PD develop , unacceptable toxicity participant withdraw consent , point discontinue . Upon discontinuation study treatment PD reason , participant assess two time per year , five year , survival , second primary malignancy subsequent anti-myeloma therapy . Two analysis plan course Phase 2 segment : one interim analysis ( 50 % information progression-free survival ( PFS ) event ) one final analysis . The Data Monitoring Commmittee recommend Celgene personnel unblinded base strength data . Subsequently , Celgene decide file application base current study data . The product approve FDA February 2013 . Since analysis require per protocol support marketing application , study amend remove undue burden patient remain active treatment end treatment segment study transfer active patient tothe Long-term Follow-up Phase . These patient continue treat pomalidomide provide Pomalyst Celgene Patient Support Program ( Pomalyst REMSTM ) disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , investigator decides change therapy patient decision . Investigators treat patient accord local standard care follow assessment require patient Long-term Follow-up Phase . These assessment include subsequent myeloma therapy , second primary malignancy survival . The study continue . A final analysis perform study complete result report available .</detailed_description>
