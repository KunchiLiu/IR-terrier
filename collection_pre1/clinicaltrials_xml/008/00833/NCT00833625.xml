	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn result positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) scan do 10-14 day begin chemotherapy radiation ( chemoradiation ) predict patient cancer esophagus respond chemoradiation . Researchers also want learn biomarkers ( substance body associate cancer ) find tumor tissue predict response chemoradiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>You cancer esophagus doctor agree treatment chemoradiation try shrink cancer . You surgery remove remain tumor . How well cancer esophagus respond chemoradiation varies person person . Currently , doctor tell surgery patient chemoradiation kill cancer , cancer , much cancer . Studying patient ' PET/CT scan tumor tissue biomarkers may help researcher predict individual patient respond chemoradiation . This could spare future patient unnecessary surgery chemoradiation treatment effective . PET CT scan standard image test doctor use find cancer body . The PET scan detects signal actively grow cancer cell body CT scan show location , size , shape cancer . Combining scan provide complete information cancer location , growth , change cancer time . Currently , routine test esophageal cancer MD Anderson include PET/CT scan time diagnosis 5 6 week chemoradiation complete . Researchers hope analyze change see `` early '' PET/CT scan ( perform 10-14 day start chemoradiation ) compare PET/CT scan take time diagnosis may predict well chemoradiation work patient 's cancer . PET/CT Scan : If find eligible take part study , 10-14 day start chemoradiation treatment PET/CT scan perform . You need fast ( anything eat drink except water ) 4-6 hour PET/CT scan . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn check blood sugar level . You receive small amount fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) solution vein . Cancer cell use sugar high rate normal cell . FDG radioactive form glucose ( sugar ) commonly use PET scan . The FDG help show area body cancer cell growth . After receive FDG solution , rest quiet , darken room 45-60 minute PET/CT scan . The entire procedure take 3 hour . This PET/CT scan compare routine PET/CT scan . Your doctor tell result PET/CT scan . However , result change plan treatment receive , unless scan show disease gotten bad . Biomarkers Testing : Researchers collect sample tumor tissue previously collect MD Anderson . This tissue use biomarker test . Length Study : You active study complete PET/CT scan . Medical Record Information Collection Long-Term Follow-Up : The study staff collect information medical record test , evaluation , treatment receive part routine care . The study staff continue collect information medical record long patient MD Anderson . If stop come MD Anderson , call study staff every 3 month surgery first year every 6 month . During call , ask health status . The call take 5 minute . This investigational study . PET/CT scan routine test patient cancer esophagus . The early PET/CT scan purpose study investigational . Up 95 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
