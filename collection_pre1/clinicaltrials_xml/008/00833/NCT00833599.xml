	<brief_title>Imaging Lymphatic Function Normal Subjects Persons With Lymphatic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , method ass lymphatic function person acquire ( develop follow surgery trauma ) lymphedema , hereditary lymphedema lympho-vascular disorder . The cause disorder , mean distinguish , available exist diagnostics . A method monitor lymphatic function could assist development new therapy , prediction patient 's susceptibility develop disorder , evaluation patient 's condition responses therapy treatment . In Phase I/II trial , inject Indocyanine Green ( ICG ) off-label lymph contrast agent use custom design fluorescence imager conduct near-infrared fluorescence image dynamically follow lymphatic trafficking subject . Blood also collect DNA analysis . The resulting image analyze , phenotypes observe normal diseased subject use correlate mutation specific gene report associated lymphatic development .</detailed_description>
