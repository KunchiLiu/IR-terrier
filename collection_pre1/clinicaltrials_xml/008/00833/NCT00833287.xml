	<brief_summary>Patient major traumatic injury risk develop postoperative inflammatory complication pneumonia lung trouble call adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) . This study draw blood trauma patient several time point injury see predict great risk develop pneumonia ARDS base upon result immune lab test . We particularly interested see useful obese patient great risk post trauma complication</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunoregulatory Dysfunction Trauma Patients : Role Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The role inflammation disease increasingly appreciate clinical medicine . Too much long course inflammation lead serious sometime fatal complication patient experience significant physical trauma , particularly whose injury serious enough warrant intensive care follow . On hand , sheer stress traumatic injury leave patient deficient ability mount protective immune/inflammatory response leave susceptible concomitant infection . Another component conundrum trauma ( first hit ) , surgeon face dilemma complete surgical repair injury - second hit ( i.e . full orthopedic repair ) vs stabilization injury patient recovers shock first hit . The difficulty medical team predict safely tolerate full second hit ( total surgical restoration ) v need stabilize intervention . In obese individual , conundrum compound know immune/inflammatory alteration characteristic obese state . How patient particular safely triaged immediate v delay definitive therapy base upon specific immune/inflammatory parameter object initial pilot study . Hypothesis Obese individual experience severe traumatic injury develop immunoregulatory dysfunction shortly injury great nonobese individual experience similar traumatic injury . Depending upon severity duration immunoregulatory dysfunction , post injury inflammatory response also alter result increase risk pneumonia and/or adult respiratory distress syndrome , major morbidity associate trauma . Specific Aims 1 . Determine immunoregulatory inflammatory blood cytokine endocrine stress hormone profile adult patient significant traumatic injury correlate subsequent development pneumonia and/or adult respiratory distress syndrome . 2 . Examine role obesity initial immunoregulatory dysfunction subsequent short term clinical course trauma patient . 3 . Investigate whether demographic difference ( age , gender , race ) impact risk immunoregulatory and/or inflammatory dysfunction well risk pneumonia and/or adult respiratory distress syndrome obese non obese trauma patient .</detailed_description>
