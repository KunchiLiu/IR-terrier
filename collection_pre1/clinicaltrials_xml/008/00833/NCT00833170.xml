	<detailed_description>Observations child IBD often suggest severe course find adult . Explanations unclear , especially since child less likely engage behavior ( e.g. , smoke ) may deleterious effect disease course note adult . In many way child well `` experimental model '' IBD n't many confound medical factor adult . Both Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis believe result complex interaction genetic environmental factor ( 1 ) . Recently , gene CARD15/NOD2 chromosome 16 identify approximately 25 % Caucasian patient Crohn 's disease felt significant predispose factor development fibrostenosing disease ( 2 ) . Additionally , seropositivity perinuclear antinuclear cytoplasmic factor ( pANCA ) demonstrate much frequently patient ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease , anti-Saccharomyces antibody ( ASCA ) common latter population ( 3 ) . The importance serological abnormality clear , though data suggest influence development complication . Our hypothesis phenotypic , genotypic serologic characteristic may provide prognostic information response therapy course child IBD . This type prognostic information particularly important new therapy develop .</detailed_description>
