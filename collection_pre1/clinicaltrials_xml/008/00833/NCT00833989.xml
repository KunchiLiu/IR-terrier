	<detailed_description>GSK249320 humanise monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) bind high specificity myelin-associated glycoprotein ( MAG ) antagonise neutralises MAG-mediated inhibition show improve functional recovery stroke pre-clinical model , possibly promote neuroregeneration plasticity . The present study first patient stroke . The main aim study select tolerate dos GSK249320 use future trial evaluate efficacy improve clinical function patient recover stroke . This clinical trial design placebo-controlled , single-blind , multicenter study investigate safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) escalate repeat IV dose GSK249320 . Three sequential dose escalation cohort ( 1 , 5 15 mg/kg ) plan , 8 patient placebo 8 active cohort 1 4 patient placebo 8 active cohort 2 3 . Each patient receive 2 repeat IV dose 9 Â± 1 day apart assessment extend least 16 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have confirm diagnosis stroke Stroke onset must within last 2472 hour . Have stroke either : radiologically confirm ischaemic supratentorial . The diameter ischemic lesion &gt; 15mm singlle direction volume &gt; 4cc . OR radiologically confirm intracerebral hemorrhage supratentorial , deep ( i.e. , blood must directly contact cerebral cortex ) minimal intraventricular extension . The Intracerebral Hemorrahage ( CH ) score must 02 calculate base age , Galsgow coma Scale score ad initial CT MRI finding index stroke . See SOM full calculation procedure . Have total NIHSS score 321 . Have upper and/or low limb deficit define : Score 13 NIHSS Motor Arm question , palpable observable voluntary extension flexion finger . AND/OR b . Score 13 NIHSS Motor Leg question Aged 1890 , inclusive . Male subject females nonchildbearing potential allow participate study . Females childbearing potential also allow participate study provide use contraceptive method failure rate &lt; 1 % . History previous symptomatic stroke within 3 month prior study entry . Presence significant disability prior current stroke . Significant disability define prestroke Rankin score &gt; 2 . Presence depression active adequately control interferred major activity daily live immediately prior current stroke . Subjects alert unresponsive define score 2 3 NIHSS Level Consciousness question ( question # 1a ) . Presence significant aphasia likely confound interfere completion study assessment . Presence peripheral neuropathy , include diabetic neuropathy , clinically active symptomatic time screen . Presence neurological psychiatric disease , dementia mild cognitive impairment , prior study entry likely confound clinical evaluation . Presence demyelinate disease , multiple sclerosis . Evidence chronic comorbid condition unstable acute systemic illness , opinion investigator , could shorten subject 's survival limit his/her ability complete study . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . Presence QTcB &gt; 500 msec ; uncorrected QT &gt; 600msec ( machine manual overread ) baseline ECG . Contraindication TMS , : metal present , hardware plate scalp area TMS apply , implanted cardiac pacemaker , implant prosthetic heart valve , medication pump line , metallic implant clip head/neck , electrical , mechanical magnetic implant , neurostimulation device , orthodontic work involve ferromagnetic material occupation activity may cause accidental lodge ferromagnetic material embed metal fragment head . Subjects clear head compute tomography scan . concomitant use drug substantially low seizure threshold ( e.g. , tricyclic antidepressant neuroleptic ) know history seizure epilepsy brain tumor , recent brain injury ( within 5 year ) associate definite loss consciousness , history brain surgery Contraindication MRI , : metal present , implanted cardiac pacemaker , implant prosthetic heart valve , medication pump line , metallic implant clip head/neck , electrical , mechanical magnetic implant , neurostimulation device , orthodontic work involve ferromagnetic material , permanent tattooed metallic eyeliner occupation activity may cause accidental lodge ferromagnetic material embed metal fragment head . Subjects clear head compute tomography scan . claustrophobia Participation investigational rehabilitation paradigm target stroke recovery duration study . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) .
