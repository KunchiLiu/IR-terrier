	<brief_title>Hepatic Arterial Infusion Nab-Paclitaxel Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Liver</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Nab-paclitaxel design block cancer cell divide , may cause die . Study Drug Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level nab-paclitaxel base join study . Up 4 dose level nab-paclitaxel test . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose nab-paclitaxel found . Study Drug Administration : During Cycles 1-6 , admit hospital day time schedule receive study drug . On day admit ( Day 1 ) , catheter insert hepatic artery ( major blood vessel carry blood liver ) . You separately consent procedure , describe procedure risk detail . If melanoma spread skin , may also ask take part separate laboratory study . In study , tumor biopsy check concentration protein call SPARC tumor . Earlier clinical trial show patient tumor contain high level SPARC good chance tumor shrink nab-paclitaxel treatment . You agree laboratory study order take part main study . On Day 1 Cycles 1-6 , receive nab-paclitaxel arterial catheter 30 minute . The catheter remove receive study drug . Your vital sign measure receive study drug . You send home hospital next day vital sign stable . On Day 1 Cycle 7 beyond , receive study drug catheter vein 30 minute . You need stay hospital receive study drug vein . On Day 1 cycle , receive study drug , receive drug help prevent nausea vomit . Each cycle 3 week . Study Visits : On Days 1 21 ( + - 4 day ) every cycle , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement weight . - Your medical history record . - You ask experienced side effect . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You performance status evaluation . On Days 8 15 cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Before cycle therapy , physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Before every cycle begin Cycle 3 ( Cycles 3 , 5 , 7 ) , CT scan check status disease . Length Study : You may continue receive study drug long benefitting . You take study early experience intolerable side effect disease get bad . End-of-Study Visit : Within 28 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - You ask experienced side effect . - You chest x-ray , CT scan , ECG check status disease . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You ask new symptom may experience stop receive study drug . - If doctor think necessary , MRI check status disease . This investigational study . Nab-paclitaxel FDA approve commercially available treatment breast cancer give vein . Its use liver cancer patient , well administration hepatic artery , investigational . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
