	<criteria>Men woman â‰¥ 18 year age . For patient metastatic basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) , histological confirmation distant BCC metastasis ( eg , lung , liver , lymph node , bone ) , metastatic disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) measurable use compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . For patient locally advanced BCC , histologically confirm disease consider inoperable . For patient locally advanced BCC , radiotherapy must previously administer locally advanced BCC , unless radiotherapy contraindicate inappropriate . For patient whose locally advanced BCC irradiate , disease must progress radiation . For woman childbearing potential , agreement use two acceptable method contraception , include one barrier method , study 12 month discontinuation vismodegib ( GDC0449 ) . For men female partner childbearing potential , agreement use latex condom , advise female partner use additional method contraception study 3 month discontinuation vismodegib . Prior treatment vismodegib Hedgehog pathway inhibitor . Pregnancy lactation . Life expectancy &lt; 12 week . Patients superficial multifocal BCC may consider unresectable due breadth involvement . Concurrent nonprotocolspecified antitumor therapy ( eg , chemotherapy , target therapy , radiation therapy , photodynamic therapy ) . Recent , current , planned participation experimental drug study . History malignancy within 3 year first day treatment vismodegib study ( Day 1 ) , except tumor negligible risk metastasis death , adequately treat squamouscell carcinoma skin , ductal carcinoma situ breast , carcinoma situ cervix . Uncontrolled medical illness infection require treatment intravenous antibiotic .</criteria>
