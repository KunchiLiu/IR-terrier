	<brief_summary>Non-Arteritic Ischemic Optic Neuropathy ( NAION ) disease produce swell optic nerve ( `` cable '' go eye brain ) result decrease vision . About 15 % patient experience NAION second eye ; many patient leave legally blind . Currently , treatment NAION patient second eye become involved disease outcome devastating . The investigator conduct study investigator inject medication involve eye patient NAION . This medication might decrease swell optic nerve improve vision eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal Bevacizumab Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NAION produce ischemic insult optic nerve head presumably due hypoperfusion short ciliary artery supply . This lead release vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) swell affected area nerve . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) cause rapid reversible increase vascular permeability thus vasogenic edema affect area optic nerve head . Subsequently , increase pressure swell affect segment cause compression infarction previously affect part optic nerve create sort-of `` compartment syndrome '' . Bevacizumab known anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) agent . It investigators hypothesis inject bevacizumab intra-vitreally vasogenic edema reduce , preserve viable threaten optic nerve tissue . One recent case report describe patient sequential NAION treat intra-vitreal bevacizumab demonstrate significant improvement visual acuity visual field test ( 1 ) . An editorial issue Journal Neuro-Ophthalmology article appear suggest small study evaluate intra-vitreal injection bevacizumab NAION would support use disease , large multi-center trial could plan ( 2 ) . Intra-vitreal injection bevacizumab proven safe treatment age-related macular degeneration ( 3 ) . Because patient investigator plan enroll study face real possibility blindness therapeutic modality currently available improve visual outcome , investigator believe offer intra-vitreal bevacizumab injection might halt progression visual acuity visual field loss hypothesis correct , would greatly improve chance avoid blindness .</detailed_description>
