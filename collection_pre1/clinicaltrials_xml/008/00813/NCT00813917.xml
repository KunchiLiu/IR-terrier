	<detailed_description>In United States , approximately 7.7 million individual old 12 year age report current ( past month ) use smokeless tobacco ( ST ) . ST use associate oral extra-oral cancer well cardiovascular cerebrovascular disease . To date , pharmacotherapies show increase long-term ( ≥ 6 month ) abstinence rate ST user . Novel pharmacotherapies decrease withdrawal symptom nicotine self-administration need test ST user . Varenicline ( Chantix™ , Pfizer ) novel selective nicotinic receptor partial agonist specificity α4β2 nicotine acetylcholine receptor demonstrate remarkable efficacy increase long-term tobacco abstinence rate cigarette smoker . The novel mechanism action varenicline potentially circumvent limitation use nicotine replacement therapy bupropion pharmacotherapy ST user . The overall goal line research develop effective pharmacologic treatment ST user increase long-term ( ≥ 6 month ) abstinence rate . The central hypothesis application varenicline efficacious treatment ST user . To evaluate hypothesis , conduct pilot study obtain preliminary estimate efficacy 12-weeks varenicline increase prolonged point prevalence tobacco abstinence rate 12 week ( end-of-treatment ) ST user . We also evaluate effect varenicline nicotine withdrawal symptom tobacco craving . If result promise , plan multicenter , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial Oregon Research Institute Eugene , OR , investigate efficacy varenicline increase long-term ( ≥ 6 month ) abstinence rate ST user .</detailed_description>
