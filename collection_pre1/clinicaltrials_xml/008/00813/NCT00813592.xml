	<brief_title>Phase II Study SOM230 Patients With Recurrent Progressive Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study rationale/purpose : Most , though ( Lamberts 1995 ; Koper 1992 ) vitro study suggest addition somatostatin inhibits meningioma growth , accelerate apoptosis , suggest potential therapeutic role somatostatin receptor agonist ( Arena 2004 ) . SOM230 ( pasireotide ) novel somatostatin analogue affinity multiple somatostatin receptor . Compared octreotide ( Sandostatin® ) , SOM230 bind wider spectrum somatostatin receptor , include subtypes 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , possess high bind affinity subtypes 1 , 3 , 5 ) . In recent study evaluate expression somatostatin receptor mRNA human meningioma ( Arena 2004 ) , 88 % tumor ( 37/42 ) positive least 1 5 SSTR subtypes . SSTR1 SSTR2 commonly detect meningioma ( 69 % ( 29/42 ) 79 % ( 33/42 ) respectively ) . The subtypes also frequently detect ( 43 % , 33 % , 33 % SSTR3 , SSTR4 , SSTR5 respectively ) . In recently complete study SOM230 patient Cushing 's disease acromegaly , clinical response document patient refractory Sandostatin . In summary , SOM230 broad bind affinity somatostatin receptor Sandostatin® , toxicity modest , qualitatively identical Sandostatin® , long half-life ( approximately 23 hour ) allow convenient ( twice daily contrast three time day ) dose schedule compare Sandostatin® . For reason , anticipate efficacy tolerability SOM230 patient recurrent meningiomas well observe Sandostatin . We therefore , propose formal phase II trial SOM230 ( pasireotide ) patient recurrent progressive meningioma already undergone candidate additional surgery radiation . OBJECTIVES : Primary objective To determine objective response rate ( ORR ) ( complete response [ CR ] plus partial response [ PR ] ) SOM230 monotherapy patient recurrent progressive meningioma previously undergone candidate additional surgery radiation . Secondary objective 1 . To determine duration response SOM230 2 . To establish 6-month progression-free survival rate 3 . To establish median PFS overall survival ( OS ) 4 . To determine clinical benefit rate ( CR + PR + stable disease ) SOM230 5 . To characterize safety tolerability SOM230 Exploratory objectives 1 . To determine pharmacokinetic profile SOM230 2 . To analyze expression somatostatin receptor subtypes tumor specimen ( immunohistochemistry ) study participant ( octreotide scan ) . Please refer section 7.7.2 7.5.4.5 full protocol . 3 . To measure serum IGF level patient prior receive SOM230 4 . To determine ORR Grade 1 versus Grade 2 /3 meningioma SOM230 administer patient dose 1200 µg give subcutaneously twice daily ( Figure ) . One treatment cycle define four week therapy . Complete blood count obtain , neurologic examination contrast-enhanced cranial MRI scan perform described ( see Table 7-1 ) . Serum IGF level measure start treatment , MRI assessment point . Plasma pharmacokinetic study perform subset patient consent additional study procedure . Participation pharmacokinetic component study mandatory . All patient continue receive SOM230 disease progression death occurs , unacceptable toxicity report , patient decline therapy . In patient stable ( clinically unchanged improve radiographic disease increase decrease tumor size le 25 % ) respond disease ( clinically unchanged improve radiographic disease decrease size 50 % ) , three additional cycle SOM230 adminis¬tered , follow patient reassess . Post-Treatment Evaluation , Study Completion , Survival Phase Study evaluation determination response status perform every 3 treatment cycle first 12 cycle therapy every 6 cycle thereafter duration SOM230 treatment . At time final primary analysis , patient continue receive treatment SOM230 , well follow post-treatment evaluation , follow survival complete core phase study transition extension phase . During extension phase , data response duration , PFS safety continue collect . Study completion declare follow documentation objective tumor progression Macdonald Levin criterion ( either on-treatment post-treatment evaluation ) time death . It critical objective tumor progression Macdonald Levin criterion document patient . In event treatment discontinuation prior objective disease progression , patient remain eligible ongoing post-treatment evaluation . All antineoplastic therapy administer post-treatment phase also record part post-treatment evaluation phase .</detailed_description>
