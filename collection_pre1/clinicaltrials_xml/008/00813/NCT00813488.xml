	<criteria>Key The patient chronic pain least 3 month duration associate following condition : diabetic peripheral neuropathy , postherpetic neuralgia , traumatic injury , complex regional pain syndrome , back pain , neck pain , fibromyalgia , chronic pancreatitis , osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis , cancer . Other chronic painful condition may evaluate possible inclusion . The patient currently use least one follow : least 60 mg oral morphine/day , least 25 mcg transdermal fentanyl/hour , least 30 mg oxycodone/day , least 8 mg hydromorphone/day , equianalgesic dose another opioid/day ATC therapy least 7 day administration first dose study drug . The patient willing provide write informed consent , include write opioid agreement form , participate study . Women must surgically sterile , 2 year postmenopausal , , childbearing potential , use medically accept method birth control agree continue use method duration study . Any patient cancer life expectancy least 3 month . The patient report average PI score , 24 hour prior screen , 6 less ( 0=no pain 10=pain bad imagine ) chronic pain . The patient experience , average , least 1 less 5 BTP episode per day take ATC opioid therapy , average , duration BTP episode le 4 hour screen period . The patient currently use opioid therapy alleviation BTP episodes , occur location chronic pain , achieve least partial relief . The patient must willing able successfully self administer study drug , comply study restriction , complete electronic diary , return clinic schedule study visit specify protocol . Key The patient uncontrolled rapidly escalate pain determine investigator pain uncontrolled therapy could adversely impact safety patient could compromise treatment study drug . The patient recent history ( within 5 year ) current evidence alcohol substance abuse . The patient know suspected hypersensitivity , allergy , contraindication ingredient either study drug . The patient diagnosis chronic headache migraine primary painful condition associate BTP . The patient cardiopulmonary disease would , opinion investigator , significantly increase risk treatment potent synthetic opioids . The patient medical psychiatric disease , opinion investigator , would compromise patient 's safety collect data . The patient suicidal ideation screen history suicidal ideation within 1 year history suicide attempt within 2 year screen , diagnosis bipolar disorder history schizophrenia The patient expect surgery study impact patient 's chronic pain and/or BTP . The patient therapy study drug treatment , opinion investigator , could alter pain response pain medication . The patient pregnant lactating . The patient participate previous study FBT . The patient participate study involve investigational drug prior 30 day . The patient currently use FBT oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate BTP . The patient currently use immediaterelease oxycodone BTP unwilling undergo retitration . The patient receive monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOI ) within 14 day first treatment study drug . The patient medical condition receive concomitant medication/therapy ( e.g. , regional nerve block ) could , opinion investigator , compromise patient 's safety compliance study protocol , compromise collect data . The patient involve active litigation regard chronic pain currently treat . The patient positive UDS illicit drug medication prescribe him/her medically explainable ( i.e. , active metabolite ) . The investigator feels patient suitable study reason ( e.g. , patient 's social history indicates increase risk drug diversion ) Additional exclusion criterion apply patient decide participate pharmacokinetics assessment perform designate study site .</criteria>
