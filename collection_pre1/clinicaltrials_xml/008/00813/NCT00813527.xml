	<brief_title>Effect Lapaquistat Acetate Combined With Fenofibrate Blood Cholesterol Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated plasma cholesterol ( hypercholesterolemia ) various plasma lipid imbalance ( dyslipidemias ) major risk factor coronary heart disease . It establish lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma concentration effectively reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality . As result finding , National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III identifies control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol essential prevention management coronary heart disease . Currently , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor ( statin ) first-line monotherapies prescribe reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , diet therapeutic lifestyle change . However , low dos statin often fail produce Adult Treatment Panel III-recommended level low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction , make necessary increase dose add additional treatment . This turn may result decreased tolerability potential safety concern . At high dos , statin associate various myopathy range rare occurrence rhabdomyolysis myositis frequent symptom muscle weakness , cramp , pain ; occur mild increase creatine kinase . Statin use also associate increase liver transaminase level . These tolerability safety concern may contribute high discontinuation rate statins prescription low , often ineffective , dos . TAK-475 ( lapaquistat acetate ) inhibit cholesterol synthesis pathway different step statin ( act squalene synthase rather 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ) ; reduce concentration isoprenylated intermediate believe responsible myopathy associate statin use . This study conduct determine whether lapaquistat acetate fenofibrate potential effective fenofibrate lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol .</detailed_description>
