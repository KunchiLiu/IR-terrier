	<detailed_description>Social cognition encompasses wide spectrum ability , enable u function properly interpersonal interaction . Empathy constitute one prominent ability social cognition , represent human capability understand mental state , respond sympathetic way ( Leiberg &amp; Anders , 2006 ) . Two set theoretical mechanism design order explain empathy possible . Theory Mind ( ToM ) usually regard cognitive mechanism empathy , theory posse regard enable u infer mental state . 'Simulation ' process another different mechanism empathy . In contrast ToM perspective , simulation perspective assert understand 's state mind achieve inner representation mental state mind , thus simulate mental state . Therefore , simulation theory may associate affective aspect empathy . Schizophrenia encompass wide spectrum psychotic disorder , characterize severe cognitive , emotional behavioral impairment . People suffer schizophrenia frequently exhibit social dysfunction , prevent normal integration healthy human environment . Recently discover impairment empathy specific impairment effective TOM mostly associate social malfunctioning people suffer schizophrenia . One biological substance connect social cognition neuromodulator Oxytocin . Among known involvement uterine contraction lactate female , numerous recent study find indispensable role Oxytocin various complex prosocial behavior maternal behavior , attachment , partner preference trust . It suggest Oxytocin may mediate beneficial affect social support , find strongly involved different kind attachment . In recent study , Domes et al . ( 2006 ) find intranasal administration single dose Oxytocin enhance ability infer mental state convey eye region ( RMET , Baron-Cohen et al . 1995 ) . These finding suggest mediate role ability use social cue order infer mental state . In proposed study , plan examine influence single dose intranasal Oxytocin two primary mechanism empathy , namely mentalizing ( Theory Mind ) Simulation , healthy people people suffer schizophrenia . Mentalizing assessed variation validate ToM task , require cognitive affective mentalizing . Simulation test two different task : emotion recognition via dynamic paradigm facial expression , recognition biological motion , necessitate identification emotion convey video clip point light walker . Both latter task associate simulation processing .</detailed_description>
