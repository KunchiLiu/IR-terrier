	<brief_summary>The purpose study include ( 1 ) investigate inspiratory muscle non-inspiratory muscle function term strength , endurance , fatigability patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , ( 2 ) investigate metabolic characteristic peripheral muscle biochemistry marker patient OSA , ( 3 ) detect effect exercise training measure parameter patient OSA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study Skeletal Muscle Function Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It become increasingly recognize skeletal muscle abnormality common profound patient chronic inflammatory status . Based unique character obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , repeat intermittent apnea hypopnea cause upper airway muscle collapse inspiration , logical speculate adaptation skeletal muscle patient OSA . The purpose first part investigate inspiratory muscle function patient different severity OSA . Participants firstly underwent polysomnography assessment recruit . The measurement include Epworth sleepiness scale , strength endurance inspiratory muscle , fatigue test either maximal voluntary effort response cervical magnetic stimulation ( CMS ) simultaneously sEMG recording . In addition , exercise capacity simultaneous sEMG recording diaphragm vastus lateralis exercise test also test . The second part design examine metabolic characteristic low extremity patient OSA . Blood sample draw proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy use detect intramyocellular extramyocellular lipid content ( IMCL EMCL ) . The third part detect effect exercise training measure parameter describe patient OSA . Participants randomize exercise group , inspiratory muscle training group ( IMT ) , CPAP group . Exercise protocol include 30-minute aerobic exercise intensity 70 % -85 % VO2max , 20-minute general resistance exercise . IMT group receive inspiratory muscle strengthen device .</detailed_description>
