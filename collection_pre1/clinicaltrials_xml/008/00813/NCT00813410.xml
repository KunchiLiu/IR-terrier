	<detailed_description>Glucose management type 1 diabetic patient comprise measurement glucose capillary blood obtain fingersticking administration exogenous insulin form subcutaneous bolus injection continuous subcutaneous infusion . The present study seek test alternative treatment approach combine glucose measurement insulin delivery single subcutaneous tissue site , thereby circumvent need fingerstick blood glucose monitoring . Microperfusion microdialysis probe apply type 1 diabetic subject perform insulin delivery glucose sample adipose tissue site . The feasibility estimate blood glucose concentration glucose level measure subcutaneous insulin delivery site assess overnight fast oral glucose tolerance test .</detailed_description>
