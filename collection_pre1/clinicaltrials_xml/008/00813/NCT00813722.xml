	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate importance provide guideline patient via active telephone call blood pressure control discontinuation treatment among hypertensive patient . Hypertensives ( N = 354 ) could receive telephone call remind date medical appointment instruct hypertension distribute two group : ) `` uncomplicated '' - hypertensives concurrent disease ; b ) `` complicate '' - severe hypertensive ( mean diastolic ≥ 110 mm Hg without medication ) comorbidities . All patient , except exclude ( n=44 ) , open block randomize follow two treatment regimen : `` traditional '' `` current '' receive active telephone call ( `` phone call '' group ) receive telephone call ( `` phone call '' group ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Active Telephone Calls Compliance Hypertensive Patients With Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate importance provide guideline patient via active telephone call blood pressure management discontinuation treatment hypertensive patient , use two treatment regimen low-dose medication , offer free avoid influence financial factor . We opt regimen call `` traditional '' base diuretic beta-blockers , another one call `` current '' treatment base angiotensin II antagonist calcium channel blocker . Patients Methods The patient study essential hypertension could receive telephone call remind date medical appointment receive guidance hypertension ; patient gender , ethnic background , 18 year old body mass index 40 kg/m2 , enrol study sign free informed consent term . The study approve Ethics Committee Board Directors General Hospital São Paulo University School Medicine . Exclusion criteria patient blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication , pregnant woman nurse mother , patient secondary hypertension , white-coat hypertension systolic pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg doctor 's office awake mean systolic pressure &lt; 135 mm Hg awake mean diastolic pressure &lt; 85 mm Hg without antihypertensive medication , malignant hypertension , presence liver dysfunction evidence patient 's clinical history one liver function test level twice normal value ( alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin , aspartate aminotransferase ) , patient clinical condition might interfere total conformity study might increase risk participate study , patient previous history hypersensitivity reaction study medication , patient history alcoholism , drug abuse mental disorder might invalidate free informed consent limit patient 's ability meet protocol rule , patient participate study involve investigational drug drug already market within previous month , enrollment study concomitantly study . Measurement blood pressure perform five time nursing staff right upper limb , patient sitting , use cuff appropriate size arm validate automatic oscillometric device ( Dixtal , DX 2710 , São Paulo , Brazil ) The mean last two measurement calculate record long difference measurement less 4 mm Hg . If 5 measurement difference last two one higher 4 mm Hg , measurement repeat difference two measurement less 4 mm Hg . The diagnosis hypertension make mean value last two measurement : systolic pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg without medication initial visit ( Visit 0 ) . Patients receive antihypertensive medication initial visit systolic pressure &lt; 140 mm Hg diastolic pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg re-evaluated 8 week discontinuation medication introduction placebo , include study mean value systolic pressure ≥ 140 mm Hg and/or diastolic pressure ≥ 90 mm Hg . All patient underwent Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ( ABPM ) perform validated oscillometric device ( SpaceLabs 90207 , SpaceLabs Inc , Richmond , WA , USA ) , 5 week start placebo eliminate case patient white-coat hypertension patient receive placebo identify white coat effect . Patients assign two group : ) `` uncomplicated '' - compose hypertensive patient without complication without concurrent disease ; b ) `` complicate '' , include patient severe hypertension ( mean diastolic pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg without medication ) comorbidities diabetes mellitus 7 , renal failure ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.4mg/dL ) , coronary insufficiency , congestive heart failure prior history cerebrovascular accident . All patient , complicate uncomplicated group , open block randomize receive active telephone call ( `` phone call '' group ) receive telephone call ( `` phone call '' group ) follow two treatment regimen : `` traditional '' `` current '' . Thus , first visit randomization , patient `` phone call '' group invite enroll telephone program call `` Biosintética Assistance '' support Biosintética Laboratory . The patient subscribe started receive active telephone call appropriately train operator well magazine health-related information , send periodically mail . There 6 contact telephone study . The patient remind attend next visit ; he/she receive instruction hypertension well necessary clarification . All patient randomize `` phone call '' group invite attend occasional informative lecture participation multidisciplinary team . At initial stage treatment , `` uncomplicated '' group receive , 8 week treatment placebo , one follow treatment regimen : ) `` traditional '' treatment hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg 2x/day atenolol 25 mg 2x/day ; b ) `` current '' treatment losartan 25 mg 2x/day amlodipine 2.5 mg 2x/day . If blood pressure could control visit , medication dos double another antihypertensive add . The `` complicated '' group undergo treatment period placebo randomized receive `` traditional '' `` current '' drug regimens similar one administer `` uncomplicated '' group , consider specificity condition . The addition antihypertensive agent `` uncomplicated '' group , well specificity regimens patient `` complicate '' group , perform accord guideline V Brazilian Guidelines Arterial Hypertension . 5 All patient instruct take medication every day 7:00 7:00 pm , variation one hour . All medication necessary 12 month treatment supply patient physician end visit sufficient amount cost next visit , order eliminate financial factor analysis . Patients instructed bring remain pill subsequent visit count nursing staff , without patient ' knowledge procedure . Doctors ' visit , precede nursing staff visit , take place every 8 week 56 week measurement blood pressure , heart rate weight . The weight check patient wear light clothes barefoot scale ( model 2096PP , Toledo Brasil , São Paulo , SP , Brazil ) . Study withdrawal characterize non-attendance medical visit 3 month schedule date . The patient return within 3 month schedule date would continue study evaluate unscheduled visit . The test perform treatment placebo 40 week active treatment include : fasting glucose , urea , creatinine , total cholesterol , fraction cholesterol , triglyceride , uric acid , total bilirubin , CPK , Na+ , K+ , hemoglobin , TSH , alkaline phosphatase , AST , ALT urinary excretion sodium 24 h .</detailed_description>
