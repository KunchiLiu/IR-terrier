	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess objective tumor response single agent treatment PEP02 , irinotecan , docetaxel locally advanced metastatic gastric gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study PEP02 , Irinotecan Docetaxel Gastric Gastroesophageal Junction Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Palliative chemotherapy show improve survival compare best supportive care alone patient unresectable recurrent gastric cancer . There standard second-line chemotherapy advance gastric cancer randomized-controlled trial data suggest benefit second-line chemotherapy compare supportive care alone . Response rate second-line therapy phase II trial similar see cancer commonly retreat . Combination therapy may achieve high response rate single agent , however , survival outcome . In addition , data suggest patient may obtain symptomatic benefit second-line therapy . In comparison toxicity profile single agent combination regimen , patient tolerable single agent therapy combination . Based previous clinical experience second line chemotherapy advance gastric cancer , single agent PEP02 , irinotecan docetaxel select regimen randomize phase II study . The efficacy toxicity outcome three-arm design valuable reference future combination therapy phase III study design .</detailed_description>
