	<brief_title>Study Bortezomib Dexamethasone With Without Cyclophosphamide Patients With Relapsed Not Controllable Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-centre , randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , control , open-label ( people involve study know identity assign drug ) , parallel ( group patient treat time ) group phase III study determine efficacy standard therapy bortezomib low dose dexamethasone combination without continuous low dose oral cyclophosphamide primary refractory relapse myeloma patient ( 1st - 3rd relapse ) . The study consist screening period , may last day -14 day -1 application first dose bortezomib ( cycle 1 , day 1 ) , treatment phase begin cycle 1 day 1 continue completion discontinuation study drug follow-up phase . All patient follow end treatment regardless response . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive either treatment arm ( Group A : receiving bortezomib plus dexamethasone Group B receive bortezomib plus dexamethasone plus cyclophosphamide ) . Patients receive eight 3-weeks treatment cycle , unless experience either unacceptable toxicity patient request withdraw study . The maximum number cycle dependent patient response investigator 's discretion . It recommend patient confirm complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional cycle beyond confirmation . Patients achieve CR partial response receive total 8 cycle . For patient achieve stable disease within investigator 's discretion continue study treatment beyond 6 cycle , discussion sponsor . After completion treatment patient follow every 12 week 72 week . If study still ongoing follow period do every 26 week study end , patient reach progressive disease start alternative anti-myeloma therapy , early . In case progressive disease ( PD ) already establish treatment phase patient enter follow-up phase . In case PD start alternative anti-myeloma treatment end study follow-up phase discontinue patient date death patient document ( applicable ) end study .</detailed_description>
