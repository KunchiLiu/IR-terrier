	<brief_summary>The standard treatment approach patient high-grade primary brain tumor include maximum feasible surgical resection , follow 6 week concurrent cranial irradiation daily low-dose temozolomide chemotherapy , follow 12 cycle high-dose temozolomide administer 5 consecutive day every 4 week [ Stupp 2005 ] . Contrast-enhanced MRI current standard evaluate success therapy monitor tumor recurrence . MRI typically obtain prior initial surgery , within 24 hour surgery , conclusion cranial irradiation , every 8 week temozolomide chemotherapy evidence recurrence . Despite careful clinical radiographic surveillance , despite decade research histologic molecular classification primary brain tumor , ability predict tumor behavior remain limited . Some gliomas result overall survival time month , whereas histologically-identical glioma may yield survival year decade [ Carson 2007 , Curran 1993 , Lamborn 2004 ] . Current assessment tumor response therapy also poor . Patients complete radiographic response cranial irradiation often progress rapidly post-irradiation . In contrast , patient enhance mass end chemoradiotherapy may respond dramatically chemotherapy alone , mass may even disappear absence therapy ( call `` tumor pseudoprogression '' ) [ Chamberlain 2007 ] . This confound situation demonstrate need good assessment tumor response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Positron emission tomography ( PET ) molecular image modality probe various aspect tumor function use variety radio-labeled imaging agent ( `` tracer '' ) . Oncologic PET image see dramatic rise clinical utilization past decade cancer detection , stag , evaluate residual recurrent disease follow therapy . These clinical scan use tracer [ 18F ] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ( FDG ) , accumulate cell proportion GLUT transporter hexokinase activity . FDG thus provide measure tissue glucose metabolism . Concurrent clinical growth , number PET tracer receive significant attention research variety image target . Of special interest tracer 3'-deoxy-3'- [ 18F ] fluorothymidine ( FLT ) , 1- [ 11C ] -acetate ( ACE ) , [ 15O ] water ( H2O ) . The uptake , retention/washout , ultimate biodistribution tracer related different functional molecular process . As , use probe different aspect tumor function : FLT directly assess tumor proliferation , ACE provide measure tumor growth related fatty acid membrane synthesis , H2O quantify tumor perfusion . OBJECTIVES : This study two primary objective : translational objective new PET image technology translate experimental development ( simulation animal ) first use human subject ; exploratory objective complementary value multiple PET tracer investigate . Each objective described , study design carefully setup fulfill objective study population . The translational objective study implement evaluate new image technology rapid , single-scan multi-tracer PET image tracer . Current PET technology prohibits image one tracer single scan since image signal tracer distinguish normal technique ; , separate scan tracer currently need acquire hour day apart . Our group develop technique algorithm recover individual-tracer image rapidly-acquired multi-tracer PET data use dynamic image technique . These method test extensive simulation verify experimentally canine model spontaneously-occurring tumor . Refinement method advance algorithms ongoing . The patient image study protocol implement two phase . In Phase A , separate single-tracer image tracer perform . The data scan co-registered combine `` emulate '' multi-tracer scan , process multi-tracer signal-separation algorithm . This permit direct comparison image biomarkers multi-tracer vs. single-tracer scan tracer . Such comparison technique establish investigator accept peer review test multi-tracer signal-separation algorithm . Once statistically-significant evidence obtain multi-tracer scan accurately provide image biomarkers separate single-tracer scan , image transition Phase Bâ€”in actual multi-tracer scan perform . The objective exploratory study preliminarily evaluate complementary value FDG , FLT , ACE , H2O PET patient primary glial neoplasm . Multi-tracer PET profile four tracer obtain 20 patient primary glial neoplasm three timepoints : ( 1 ) `` baseline '' prior surgery immediately surgery provide complete surgical resection possible confirm post-operative contrast MRI scan residual tumor great 1.0 cm diameter present prior tumor-directed therapy ; ( 2 ) conclusion initial ( ~6-8 week ) chemoradiotherapy ; ( 3 ) time MRI-documented recurrence within 2 year . In addition , patient know primary brain tumor previously undergone treatment recur base standard clinical imaging criterion eligible study . A number quantitative pseudo-quantitative imaging biomarkers tracer compute imaging timepoint , change biomarker timepoints also compute . These data compare clinical endpoint ( survival , time progression ) , tumor biologic information ( histology , WHO grade , vascularity , Ki-67 , VEGF , EGFR , p53 ) case tumor tissue become available standard care . These data provide pilot information potential value concurrent multiple PET biomarkers predict tumor behavior prior start therapy , improve prognostication , efficient effective tumor surveillance , and/or appropriate assignment patient conventional , aggressive , investigational therapy early clinical course . The driving hypothesis overall line research multiple PET image biomarkers obtain conjunction provide improve image-guided personalized care patient primary glial neoplasm . The term `` personalize care '' use broadly include prediction tumor behavior prior start therapy , tumor surveillance , prognostication , individualized assignment patient conventional , aggressive , investigational therapy early clinical course . This pilot project obtain initial data value PET biomarkers image-guided personalized care . Specific hypothesis test include : - HYPOTHESIS I : Rapid , single-scan multi-tracer PET image recover PET image biomarker information tracer significantly different obtain conventional , single-tracer scan tracer . - HYPOTHESIS II b : Multi-tracer PET biomarkers , obtain conjunction , well able predict tumor aggressiveness individual-tracer biomarkers conventional radiographic imaging . - HYPOTHESIS III b : Multi-tracer PET biomarkers , obtain conjunction , well able detect functional change tumor state occur response therapy individual-tracer biomarkers conventional radiographic imaging . - HYPOTHESIS IV b : Characterization multiple aspect tumor function ( glucose metabolism , proliferation , membrane growth , perfusion ) provide new insight tumor status guide selection appropriate therapy . Sufficient statistical power expect obtain protocol validate extensive simulation experimental evaluation perform previously concurrently patient image study . b Pilot data regard three hypothesis obtain work study correlation PET image biomarkers clinical outcome tumor biologic information . Though high statistical power expect limited number patient pilot study , underlie trend data identify , permit formulation formal hypothesis test future rigorous trial .</detailed_description>
