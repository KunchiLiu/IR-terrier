	<brief_summary>Patients diabetes high blood sugar level ( hyperglycemia ) pancreatic beta-cells longer produce sufficient insulin . Insufficient beta-cell function cause autoimmune kill beta-cells type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , poorly understood mechanism type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) . Glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) improve function insulin-producing beta cell , GLP-1 short circulate half-life cleave enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV ( DPP-4 ) . One current treatment use improve glycemia control patient T2D sitagliptin , inhibitor DPP-4 . By inhibit DPP-4 , sitagliptin increase GLP-1 level , result improve beta cell function . Sitagliptin tested individual new-onset T1D determine whether may help preserve beta cell function . Because T1D disease immune system destroy insulin-producing beta cell pancreas , wish determine sitagliptin alters immune function . Sitagliptin show Merck safe effective overt immuno-toxicities . However , several line evidence suggest DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin could immunomodulatory . This randomized clinical trial study immune function healthy volunteer give short-term ( 4 week ) treatment either sitagliptin placebo . During study , take blood sample various time interval , treatment . We compare immune response without sitagliptin treatment use blood sample healthy individual . We measure change magnitude type immune response . The study period nine week . The study primary outcome change blood plasma level protein marker associate decreased inflammation : Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1 ( TGF beta 1 ) . In addition , plan use blood sample measure sitagliptin effect expression level several cytokine ( immune protein ) . We also measure level proliferation stimulate PBMCs ( blood immune cell ) gene expression whole blood sitagliptin treatment .</brief_summary>
