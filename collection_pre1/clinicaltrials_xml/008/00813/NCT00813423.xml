	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose sunitinib malate give together hydroxychloroquine treat patient advance solid tumor respond chemotherapy . Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Hydroxychloroquine may help sunitinib malate work well treat solid tumor . Giving sunitinib malate together hydroxychloroquine may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Hydroxychloroquine Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors That Have Not Responded Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) combination sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) ( Sutent ) , oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor antiangiogenic activity inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) , stem cell factor receptor ( c-kit ) platelet derive growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) , combination hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) , inhibitor autophagy , patient advance solid tumor refractory standard chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluating block tissue pre-treatment diagnostic biopsy tissue biopsy take therapy , available enrolled patient , expression marker beclin1 , light chain 3 ( LC3 ) , sequestosome 1 ( p62 ) hypoxia up-regulated 1 ( GRp170 ) indicator autophagy potential . II . Evaluating pre- post- treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) tumor tissue , available , presence autophagosomes electron microscopy ( EM ) indication flux autophagy pathway . III . Evaluating pre- post- treatment PBMC change expression LC3 , p62 GRp170 use single agent sunitinib use combination sunitinib hydroxychloroquine . IV . Evaluating circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) pre- post- treatment single agent sunitinib sunitinib + HCQ , characterize marker autophagy . ( exploratory ) V. To determine whether steady-state plasma concentration HCQ correlate inhibition autophagy whether pharmacokinetic interaction exist sunitinib HCQ . VI . To examine , available , post treatment tumor biopsy vascular marker detect decrease vascular proliferation stain cluster differentiation 31 ( CD31 ) , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , thrombospondin-1 , cluster differentiation 105 ( CD105 ) stain monitor micro vessel density . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study hydroxychloroquine . Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 hydroxychloroquine PO daily ( QD ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-42 ( begin day 4 course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 42 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
