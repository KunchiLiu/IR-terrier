	<brief_title>Study PEP02 Second Line Therapy Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine monotherapy gemcitabine-based combination regimen standard first line therapy advance pancreatic cancer . After disease progression , standard treatment available . In animal study previous phase I trial , PEP02 show anti-tumor activity preliminary efficacy pancreatic cancer . In addition , phase II study free-form irinotecan single agent already show encouraging activity second-line treatment patient advance pancreatic cancer refractory gemcitabine . The liposome formulation PEP02 theoretically therapeutic advantage free-form irinotecan , site-specific delivery extend release drug . Hence PEP02 may able provide good efficacy free-form irinotecan . The primary purpose phase II study evaluate activity PEP02 second-line therapy patient metastatic pancreatic cancer fail gemcitabine treatment . The primary goal measure 3-month survival rate . An optimal Simon 's 2-stage design use exploratory phase II study .</detailed_description>
