	<brief_summary>CORE Phase 2 clinical trial newly diagnose glioblastoma subject unmethylated O6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid methyltransferase ( MGMT ) gene promoter tumor tissue . The MGMT gene promoter section deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) act control element expression MGMT . Methylation MGMT gene promoter find appear predictive marker benefit temozolomide ( TMZ ) treatment . In safety run-in period dedicate study center , safety tolerability Cilengitide give intense treatment combination first part standard therapy assess . Thereafter trial investigate overall survival progression-free survival subject receive two different regimen Cilengitide combination standard treatment versus standard treatment alone .</brief_summary>

The histological diagnosis obtain neurosurgical resection tumor open biopsy ( stereotactic biopsy allow ) 2 . Tumor tissue specimens glioblastoma surgery open biopsy ( formalinfixed paraffinembedded ) must available MGMT gene promoter status analysis central pathology review 3 . Proven unmethylated MGMT gene promoter status ( , cutoff ratio le ( &lt; ) 2 mean applied test determine MGMT gene promoter status ) 4 . Males female great equal ( &gt; = ) 18 year age 5 . Interval &gt; = 2 week less equal ( = &lt; ) 7 week surgery biopsy first administration study treatment 6 . Available postoperative gadoliniumenhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( GdMRI ) perform within &lt; 48 hour surgery 7 . Stable decrease dose steroid &gt; = 5 day prior randomization 8 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) 01 9 .
