	<brief_title>Efficacy Ranibizumab Combination With Photodynamic Therapy Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main cause severe vision loss patient age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) development choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) . This debilitate form AMD affect macula lutea , central part retina , responsible high resolution visual acuity . Characteristic finding neovascular AMD include development new , abnormal blood vessel choroid layer beneath macula otherwise know CNV . Current treatment option condition include include laser therapy , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , intraocular injection ( different type anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ) alone combination . While current treatment demonstrate slow progression vision loss , neither therapy show significantly improve visual acuity . Given different mode action , believe combination therapy Ranibizumab PDT may lead good visual outcome may result improved effect treat AMD therefore may help decrease need monthly Ranibizumab injection . After first injection , regardless group patient assign , receive Ranibizumab injection 4 week interval clinically indicate . The purpose study evaluate visual outcome intraocular Ranibizumab injection combination photodynamic therapy verteporfin treatment neovascular AMD .</detailed_description>
