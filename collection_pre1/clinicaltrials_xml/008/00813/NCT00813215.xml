	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) common disease associate multiple complication increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Also , heavy economical burden society . 1st degree relative patient T2D increase risk develop T2D . This risk modify ingested diet : traditional north European diet rich saturate fat increase risk , Mediterranean diet rich monounsaturated fat protects development T2D cardiovascular disease . T2D part metabolic syndrome consist T2D , hypertension , adipositas , dyslipidemia steatosis . The pathogenesis metabolic syndrome partly explain fast dyslipidemia , postprandial dysmetabolism ( derangement lipid carbohydrate metabolism ) impair metabolic flexibility . Partly , explain chronic low-grade inflammation peripheral tissue . The dysmetabolism inflammation correlate entity exert influence common biochemical pathway . This establish patient T2D , sparsely study healthy relative patient T2D . In project , investigator study postprandial dysmetabolism , inflammation , oxidative stress , adipocytokines , incretins , appetite regulate hormone expression gene involve mentioned . We compare healthy 1st degree relative patient T2D healthy control family history T2D look difference response meal stimulation respectively saturate monounsaturated fat . The subject thoroughly examine hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp DEXA scan . Before meal stimulation , perform calorimetry ( order determine metabolic rate ) , take blood sample perform muscle fat tissue biopsy . The biopsy use study vast number gene . The project give u new valuable knowledge interaction intermediate metabolism innate immune system early pre-diabetic change 1st degree relative patient T2D . In long run , project contribute improve guidance treatment person risk develop T2D .</brief_summary>
