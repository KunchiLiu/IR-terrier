	<brief_summary>Age relate macular degeneration ( AMD ) multifactorial disease strong genetic component . Most importantly genetic polymorphism gene encode complement factor H ( CFH ) recently identify highly associate increase risk develop AMD . This Tyr402His polymorphism locate chromosome 1q31 implicated play role development disease . For purpose total 200 patient wet AMD include study . As described detail , current study aim identify potentially non-responders anti-VEGF therapy base genetic analysis VEGF polymorphism complement factor H polymorphism .</brief_summary>
