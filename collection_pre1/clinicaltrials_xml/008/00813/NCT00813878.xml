	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To determine CEA level nipple secretion blood sample breast cancer patient normal control . - To determine sensitivity specificity measure CEA level nipple secretion blood sample detection breast cancer . - To validate optical biosensor CEA level measure blood nipple secretion breast cancer patient normal control compare standard protein assay . - To develop profile protein present affect v unaffected breast use mass spectrometry . OUTLINE : Patients participant undergo nipple secretion blood sample collection baseline 1 month evaluation level carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) pattern protein expression may indicate presence early-stage breast cancer . Nipple secretion obtain affect unaffected breast via capillary , aspiration ( nipple aspirate fluid [ NAF ] ) , nipple blot . CEA level measure serum sample , NAF , nipple secretion use standard CEA protein assay . Nipple secretion obtain nipple blot analyze nipple blot assay determine feasibility use technique . The result nipple blot assay compare result standard protein assays evaluate sensitivity specificity nipple blot test . CEA expression also determine breast tissue specimen obtain patient undergoing diagnostic biopsy . Specimens examine IHC tissue CEA level . Proteomic profile NAF serum sample measure use liquid chromatography mass spectrometry compare proteomic profile normal healthy control . Once feasibility nipple blot assay determine , optical biosensor develop detect fluorescent-labeled antibody direct CEA find serum breast section . Optical biosensor CEA level measure breast cancer patient normal control compare standard protein assay evaluation sensitivity specificity biosensor measurement . After completion study intervention , patient participant follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
