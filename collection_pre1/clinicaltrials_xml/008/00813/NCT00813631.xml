	<brief_summary>Background . Malignant fungating wound ( MFW ) cause cancerous cell invade skin tissue , exhibit increase bacterial burden result negative physical impact ( odour , exudate , pain , infection ) patient , impair quality life , also increase treatment cost . A systematic review effectiveness silver-releasing dress management infect chronic wound help enhance control wound bed infection inflammation , tissue management , moisture balance , protect wound edge . However , study examine effect people MFW . Hypothses In study hypothesize cancer patient ionic silver dress group perception high quality life compare patient control group receive non-ionic silver dressing . In addition , hypothesize cancer patient also receive ionic silver dress low level symptom distress end study compare patient control group receive non-ionic silver dress care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Ionic Silver Dressing Head Neck Patients With Malignant Fungating Wound</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction . At begin 21st century , cancer increase age population patient often great life expectancy 40 year ago ( Payne et al 2004 ) . As people age , incidence cancer increase , essential push frontier oncology care meet symptom management need patient . For many , cancer become slowly progressive , chronic disease - change bring particular challenge oncology nurse ( Hoskin Makin 1998 ) . A systematic review effectiveness silver-releasing dress management infect chronic wound help enhance control wound bed infection inflammation , tissue management , moisture balance , protect wound edge . This study design assess effect ionic silver dressing ( AQUACEL Ag ) head neck patient malignant fungating wound ( MFW ) quality life , symptom distress wound bed changed patient MFW Definition MFW . Malignant Fungating wound arise result infiltration structure skin malignant cell . These cell may arise primary skin cancer , underlie malignant tumor metastasis spread distant malignant tumor ( Punder , 1998 ) .A fungating cancer primary secondary malignant growth skin ulcerated result pain , exudate , bleeding , infection malodour ( Twycross , 1995 ) .A malignant tumor invade destroy adjacent tissue spread tissue cell break travel blood lymph system . It develop blood supply , sometime outgrow cause tumor become necrotic middle ( Mera , 1997 ) .Dealey ( 1994 ) state , tumor extends , capillary rupture , lead epithelium result ulceration skin , lesion present fungating , foul-smelling mass ( Daeley , 1994 ) .Fungating malignant wound cause infiltration skin support blood lymph vessel local tumor result metastasis growth primary tumor . Unless malignant cell check single combination cancer treatment fungation extend potential cause massive damage wind site combination proliferate growth , loss vascularity ulceration ( Mortimer , 1998 ) .A fungating wound define cancerous lesion involve skin , open may drain . The lesion may result primary cancer metastasis skin local tumor tumor distant site . It may take form cavity , open area surface skin , skin nodule , nodular growth extend surface skin ( British Columbia Cancer Agency , 2001 ) .As malignant cell multiply skin form tumour enlarge cause disruption skin capillary lymph vessel , eventually lead tissue Hypoxia subsequent skin necrosis . Infection control MFW . All chronic wound contain bacteria . Kingsley ( 2003 ) state change number bacteria body 's response continuum , rating contamination infection ( Kingsley , 2003 ) . Contamination mean bacteria present wound surface proliferate clinic effect ; colonise imply bacteria proliferate , host reaction ; critical colonisation occur body 's local host response start initiate , systemic sign infection ; Infection point time bacteria multiply invaded deeper tissue , heal impaired produce systemic host reaction ( Jacqui . Fletcher , 2005 ; Verdu Soriano , Rueda Lopez , Martinez Cuervo , &amp; Soldevilla Agreda 2004 ) . Clinical recognition rating stage easy clear descriptor . However , Soriano et al ( 2004 ) define classification accord number bacteria present wound bed : Contamination-≦103 colony-forming unit ( CFUs ) per gram tissue ; colonise -≦104 CFUs ; Infection -≧105 CFUs . Cutting White note several aspect wound infection : serous drainage concurrent inflammation , discolour granulation tissue , pocket wound base , unexpected pain , foul odour , increase exudate , exudate becomes purulent instead serous , wound breakdown ( White &amp; Cutting , 2006 ) . In MFW , presence hypoxic necrotic tissue within wound provide excellent medium growth aerobic anaerobic bacteria ( J. Clark , 2002 ) . Anaerobic aerobic bacteria thrive condition , give rise excessive malodour wound exudate ( Haisfield-Wolfe &amp; Rund 1997 ) . Lo et al ( 2006 ) survey seventy cancer patient MFW Taiwan , study find 60.3 % wound bed present necrotic tissue ; malodour present 50 % patient ; 81.4 % show moderate large exudate 71.4 % report purulent ( Lo , 2006 ) . According data , infection emerge major health problem patient suffers MFW . Ionic silver dressing . Silver , common ionic ( active ) form ( Ag+ ) , particularly attractive antibacterial agent readily incorporate dressing material . When material contact aqueous environment , silver complex contain dissociate ( Ovington 2004 , White &amp; Cutting 2006 ) . The mechanism action Ag+ bind bacterial cell DNA , enzymes , protein cell wall . Once silver cation attache site , alters structure , result structural functional change bacterial cell ( Ovington 2004 ) .It suggest numerous author silver dressing utilized critical colonization within wound occurs ( Ovington 2004 , White &amp; Cutting 2006 , Lo et al 2008 ) . Therefore , study research question ( 1 ) What effect ionic silver dressing ( AQUACEL Ag ) head neck patient malignant fungating wound , compare hydrofiber dressing ( AQUACEL ) , individual perception subjective quality life ? ( 2 ) What effect ionic silver dressing ( AQUACEL Ag ) head neck patient malignant fungating wound , compare hydrofiber dressing ( AQUACEL ) alone , symptom distress wound bed changed patient receive ionic silver dressing ( AQUACEL Ag ) cancer patient ?</detailed_description>
