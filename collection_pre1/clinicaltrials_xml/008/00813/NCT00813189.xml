	<brief_summary>Children suffer chronic disease receive long-term glucocorticoid therapy suffer year severe growth retardation profoundly alter body composition . They consist marked increase fat mass decrease lean body mass . Published study show Growth Hormone ( GH ) treatment child Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis improve body composition increase lean mass prevent increase fat mass . The aim present protocol evaluate whether increase lean body mass observe GH treatment associate change muscle strength mass . In order able evaluate effect GH muscle comparative group need . Therefore proposed delay group patient start Growth Hormone ( GH ) treatment 6 month . As publication show maximum effect GH within first year treatment , six month enough evaluate short-term effect GH muscle . Therefore , study randomize trial : immediate start Growth Hormone ( GH ) treatment versus start Growth Hormone treatment 6 month later . After 6 month child treat GH . Therefore , follow-up one year baseline .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Recombinant Growth Hormone Muscle Function Children Long-term Treated With Glucocorticoid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim present protocol evaluate effect GH treatment long-term steroid treat child , muscle mass , muscle strength . It open , randomize , control , 2-parallel group study . The follow-up study one year . The objective study evaluate short-term effect GH treatment muscle mass , muscle strength body composition child suffer various disease require steroid therapy . Expected pathology juvenile idiopathic arthritis , nephrotic syndrome , uveitis , systemic disease organ transplantation . Changes muscle mass assess measure muscle sub-cutaneous fat cross sectional area thigh MRI . MRI offer advantage non-invasive technique , allow serial accurate measurements.Muscle strength perform serial muscular test different muscular group . Body composition assess DEXA . DEXA allow rapid , accurate highly reproductible determination bone mass also lean fat mass whole body , low radiation exposure.It appear sensitive method assessment muscle waste well fat repartition contribute Cushing 's appearance steroid treat patient . The present study perform child growth retardation relate long-term glucocorticoid treatment These patient never treat GH . In order able evaluate effect GH muscle comparative group need . Therefore propose study delay group patient start GH treatment 6 month . Six month enough evaluate short-term effect GH muscle publication show maximum effect GH within first year treatment . Therefore , study randomize trial : immediate start GH treatment versus start GH treatment 6 month later . After 6 month child treat GH . The dose administer present trial GH dose already test glucocorticoid treat child ( 0.46 mg/kg/week )</detailed_description>
