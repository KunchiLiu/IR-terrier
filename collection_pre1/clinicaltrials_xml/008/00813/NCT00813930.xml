	<brief_title>Lifestyle Intervention For Effective Diabetes Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes lead cause cardiovascular mortality morbidity , often difficult disease individual manage effectively . People diabetes commit self-care regimen include , careful monitoring blood sugar , blood pressure , cholesterol , eat healthy , exercise , foot care regular physical eye check-ups . This quite daunt stressful undertake , largely dependent individual self-motivation . Family physician assist patient manage diabetes significant time constraint may always able deliver high service intensity require reduce morbidity and/or may inadequate access resource help patient positively change self-care behaviour . Chronic disease-management program involve home-based nursing health promotion show reduce mortality , reduce recurrent hospitalization , improve indirect societal cost among specific subgroup population , include diabetes , however , intervention costly cumbersome implement give need home-based visit . INTERxVENT telephone-based , individualized , chronic cardiovascular lifestyle management program combine formal management plan , case-managed care ( coach/mentor ) , educational module teach patient modify sustain healthy lifestyle behaviour . It comprise several individualized module ( e.g. , diet , exercise , stress management , smoke cessation , chronic disease ) , prescribe algorithmically accordance patient 's individual risk profile , environmental surroundings , behavioural readiness change . All recommendation accord best-practice standard evidence-based guideline . Nonrandomized intervention study assess INTERxVENT diabetic , pre-diabetic , metabolic syndrome population demonstrate significant reduction biologically relevant measure , fast glucose , glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , lipid , blood pressure . However , randomize control clinical trial population assess impact INTERxVENT conduct . The propose pilot study evaluate efficacy INTERxVENT compare 'usual medical care ' improve cardiovascular risk-factor profile among individual diabetes . In addition , extent chronic disease management program yield similar effectiveness socio-economically disadvantaged individual unknown . We hypothesize chronic disease management program , like INTERxVENT , result improve intermediary biological behavioural risk profile program participant randomize intervention , regardless socio-economic condition . The result pilot study determine assist design ascertain sample size large trial , respectively , trial warrant . Additionally , chronic disease management intervention may improve overall health partaking individual relieve strain decrease cost within exist health care system .</detailed_description>
