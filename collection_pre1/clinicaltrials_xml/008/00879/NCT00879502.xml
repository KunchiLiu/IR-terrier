	<brief_title>Examining Physiology Brain Function People With Fragile X Premutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>FMR1 gene associate fragile X syndrome—the common cause mental retardation—and social , emotional , cognitive deficit . The chance develop deficit depend number time FMR1 gene repeat X chromosome . Individuals 200 copy FMR1 gene full fragile X mutation , put risk mental retardation . Individuals 55 200 copy FMR1 gene fragile X premutation ; much less likely develop mental retardation , may subtle social , emotional , cognitive deficit child likely full fragile X mutation . A theory , study test , hold deficit people fragile X premutation cause dysfunction limbic system . The limbic system consist group structure brain govern emotion behavior . This study examine people fragile X premutation determine whether extent emotional , social , memory deficit . The study also determine whether change fragile X gene function relate increase deficit brain , specifically limbic system , may involve deficit . Participation study last 2 day . Participants undergo several hour test lab back-to-back day . Testing first day include follow : provide several saliva sample ; undergo neuropsychological testing , participant solve different type problem interview emotional social experience ; undergo physical exam blood draw . Testing second day include follow : MRI scan , take picture brain participant rest perform certain task ; neuropsychological test similar day ; questionnaires emotional social experience . A family member also ask fill questionnaire participant . On 2 day , participant ask collect saliva sample home send sample study researcher . In addition , researcher keep contact participant case follow-up need next year .</detailed_description>
