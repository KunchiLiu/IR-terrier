	<brief_summary>This prospective , randomize ( 1:1 ) , double-blind , multi-center , Phase II clinical study test safety efficacy recombinant chimeric anti-tissue factor antibody ( ALT-836 ) versus placebo patient sepsis acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ALI/ARDS ) . This study divide two part first part study complete . In first part study , sixty patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive one dose study drug placebo . In second part study , ninety patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive multi-dose treatment regimen single dos every 72 hour maximum 4 dos study drug placebo , provide safety concern .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-TF Antibody ( ALT-836 ) Treat Septic Patients With Acute Lung Injury Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue factor ( TF ) -dependent procoagulant activity associate inflammatory process may play role severity progression ALI/ARDS . Recent study demonstrate TF level elevate plasma pulmonary edema fluid ARDS/ALI patient compare control patient hydrostatic pulmonary edema . These high plasma TF level correlate increased mortality , few ventilation-free day , presence disseminate intravascular coagulation presence sepsis patient ALI/ARDS , suggest systemic activation coagulation may clinically important ALI/ARDS . Moreover , pulmonary TF level patient ALI/ARDS find range 0.5 2 nM , approximately 100-fold higher simultaneous plasma level , suggest intra-alveolar source TF . Thus , anti-TF antibody blockage TF activity may therefore provide effective therapeutic mechanism treatment inflammatory disorder ALI ARDS . This study test hypothesis administration anti-TF antibody ( ALT-836 ) septic patient ALI/ARDS improve clinical outcome shorten duration mechanical ventilation patient .</detailed_description>
