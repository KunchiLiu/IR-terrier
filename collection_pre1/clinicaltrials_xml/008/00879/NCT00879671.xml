	<brief_summary>The macular pigment ( MP ) humans consist yellow , blue-absorbing carotenoid lutein zeaxanthin . The high concentration lutein zeaxanthin find fovea . Since light enter eye pass MP reach photo receptor absorb significant portion short-wavelength light . There evidence absorb property MP well ability inactivate highly reactive oxygen specie protective retina . Age-related macular degeneration lead cause blindness among developed country . The pathogenesis disease remain unknown . There , however , evidence low fruit vegetable consumption increase risk Age-Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) . Accordingly , hypothesize lutein supplementation may beneficial AMD . The present study investigate whether 6 month lutein supplementation increase MP optical density ( OD ) , influence visual acuity , depth dimension central scotoma alters symptoms patient AMD .</brief_summary>
