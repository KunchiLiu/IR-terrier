	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically confirm , advance malignant solid tumor whose disease progress standard therapy standard therapy exist 2 . All patient must least one measurable lesion define RECIST . Irradiated lesion evaluable disease progression 3 . All patient must document progressive disease enter study 4 . Age ≥ 18 year 5 . World Health Organization ( WHO ) Performance Status ≤ 2 6 . Life expectancy ≥ 12 week 7 . Patients must certain laboratory value 8 . Patients able willing swallow capsule 9 . Ability understand patient information inform consent form comply protocol 10 . Signed date write informed consent available 11 . Only patient enrol MTD : willing provide fresh predose postdose tumor biopsy . 1 . Patients present history CNS metastasis . 2 . Prior treatment Hsp90 HDAC inhibitor compound . 3 . Patients recover side effect previous systemic anticancer therapy &lt; CTCAE Grade 2 prior first dose 4 . Patients identify `` poor intermediate CYP2C9 metabolizers '' 5 . Patients receive systemic anticancer treatment prior first dose HSP990 within follow time frame : Patients receive cyclical chemotherapy within period time short cycle length use treatment ( e.g. , 6 week nitrosourea , mitomycinC ) prior start study drug recover side effect therapy Patients receive biologic therapy ( e.g. , antibody ) within period time ≤ 4 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy Patients treat continuous intermittent small molecule therapeutic within period time ≤ 5 t1/2 ≤ 4 week ( whichever short ) prior start study drug recover side effect therapy Patients receive investigational agent within period time ≤ 5 t1/2 less cycle length use treatment ≤ 4 week ( whichever short ) prior start study drug recover side effect therapy Patients receive wide field radiotherapy ( include therapeutic radioisotope strontium 89 ) ≤ 4 week limited field radiation palliation ≤ 2 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy . Patients undergone major surgery ≤ 2 week prior start study drug recover side effect therapy 6 . Treatment therapeutic dos sodium warfarin ( Coumadin ) . 7 . Patients use medication CYP2C9 inhibitor and/or medication know QT prolongation effect switch discontinue alternative drug prior commence HSP990 dosing . 8 . Unresolved diarrhea ≥ CTCAE grade 2 9 . Patients either archival tumor sample available readily obtainable course study unwilling fresh tumor sample collect baseline . 10 . Pregnant lactating woman . 11 . Fertile woman childbearing potential ( WCBP ) use adequate contraception ( abstinence , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device barrier method contraception conjunction spermicidal jelly surgically sterile ) . Male patient whose partner WCBP , use adequate contraception . 12 . Acute chronic liver disease . 13 . Acute chronic renal disease . 14 . Impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption HSP990 15 . Other concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition ( e.g. , uncontrolled diabetes , active uncontrolled infection ) could cause unacceptable safety risk compromise compliance protocol . 16 . Known diagnosis HIV infection ( HIV test mandatory ) . 17 . Patients history another primary malignancy currently clinically significant currently require active intervention 18 . Cardiac exclusion criterion : History ( family history ) long QT syndrome . Mean QTcF ≥ 480 msec screen ECG History clinically manifest ischemic heart disease include myocardial infarction , unstable angina ≤ 3 month prior study start . Left ventricular ( LV ) dysfunction ( LVEF ≤ 45 % ) MUGA ECHO Clinically significant ECG abnormality include one following : left bundle branch block ( LBBB ) , right bundle branch block ( RBBB ) leave anterior hemiblock ( LAHB ) , 3rd degree AV block . History presence atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter ventricular arrhythmia include ventricular tachycardia Torsades de Pointes . Clinically significant rest bradycardia ( &lt; 50 beat per minute ) . Patients currently receive treatment medication relative risk prolong QTcF interval induce Torsades de Pointes ( list Posttext supplement 2 ) switch discontinue alternative drug prior commence HSP990 dosing . Obligate use cardiac pacemaker . Other clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , congestive heart failure , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) Other protocoldefined inclusion/exclusion criterion may apply</criteria>
