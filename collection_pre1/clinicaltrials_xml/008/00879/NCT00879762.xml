	<brief_summary>The purpose research compare ability new investigational smallpox vaccine call IMVAMUNE® produce strong immune response smallpox disease give one single , high dose compare two low dos give one month apart . Another purpose study see quickly someone might protect smallpox . Volunteers vaccinia-naïve adult age 18 older ( born 1971 ) divide 2 group . Volunteers Group A receive high dose vaccine give 2 shot day 0 follow placebo ( inactive substance ) shot day 28 . Group B receive standard dose vaccine placebo give 2 shot day 0 follow standard dose shot Day 28 . Study participation include 10 plan study visit approximately 7 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Dose IMVAMUNE® Vaccinia-Naive Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite fact World Health Organization ( WHO ) officially declare smallpox eradicate , new threat exists due potential use variola virus agent biological warfare and/or bio-terrorism . As consequence , urgent need safe efficacious vaccine protect public smallpox . To date , majority clinical study Modified Vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) study prime-boost vaccination regimen , dose 1×10^8 tissue culture infectious dose 50 ( TCID50 ) MVA administer Days 0 28 . While vaccination regimen induce robust immune response protective variety animal model appropriate pre-smallpox release scenario , event confirm release smallpox , rapid vaccination regimen provide protective immune response would desirable . Ideally , least short-term protection could obtain single dose vaccine . While single dose MVA 1×10^8 TCID50 , induce immune response majority recipient , possible high dose MVA could provide rapid and/or strong immune response relative single , standard 1×10^8 TCID50 dose MVA . The goal study examine kinetics magnitude immune response single high dose MVA ( 5×10^8 TCID50 ) relative single prime/boost regimen use standard dos ( 1×10^8 TCID50 ) MVA . This study complement current , ongoing study , DMID Protocol 06-0012 , examine immune response compress prime/boost dosing regimens MVA administer ( 1×10^8 TCID50 ) . Upon completion study , clinical data generate inform policy maker different option post-event utilization available smallpox vaccine . The study design randomize , non-placebo control , double blind study contain two arm : Group A ( N=45 ) receive single high dose IMVAMUNE® ( 5x10^8 TCID50 , consist two 0.5 mL injection ) vaccine Day 0 single saline placebo dose ( single 0.5 mL injection ) Day 28 match two dose regimen Group B . Group B ( N=45 ) receive standard two dose regimen IMVAMUNE® ( 1x10^8 TCID50 ) vaccine Day 0 ( consist 0.5 mL injection vaccine 0.5 mL injection saline placebo ) Day 28 ( single 0.5 mL injection vaccine ) . Safety measure assessment adverse event 28 day follow last vaccination ( 56 day follow initial vaccination subject fail receive second dose ) serious adverse event six month post final vaccination , reactogenicity vaccine 15 day follow vaccination . Immunogenicity test include antibody test [ enzyme link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) plaque reduction neutralize antibody titer ( PRNT ) ] cellular immune response [ ( INF-gamma enzyme link immunospot ( ELISPOT ) ] follow vaccination six month post final vaccination . In addition , ELISA responses , use MVA VR-1508 target antigen PRNT use vaccinia WR ( Western Reserve ) target antigen explore . Participants include 90 healthy , vaccinia-naïve adult , age 18 older ( born 1971 ) . Study duration approximately 13 month ( 7 months/subject ) .</detailed_description>
