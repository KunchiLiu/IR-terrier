	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether addition drug call Avastin ( avastin ) two-drug combination carboplatin paclitaxel shrink tumor well two-drug combination alone treatment endometrial cancer . Avastin humanize monoclonal antibody ( type protein normally make immune system help defend body infection cancer ) produce Genentech , Inc. Avastin antibody direct vascular endothelial growth factor , VEGF . VEGF potent , specific growth factor well defined role normal abnormal blood vessel formation . It present wide variety normal tissue , produce excess solid cancer ( tumor ) . In set cancer , VEGF promote growth blood vessel fee tumor cell .</brief_summary>
