	<detailed_description>Patients meet inclusion criterion approach upon admission Labor Delivery . A study staff member describe study offer participation . If patient agrees participate , sign research protocol HIPAA consent form receive copy form . The patient 's chart flag , indicate study participant . The patient 's prenatal care labor delivery manage physician per standard care physician 's discretion , include routine intrapartum treatment Group B streptococcus ( GBS ) colonization use ampicillin . When participate patient diagnose chorioamnionitis , randomize blinded fashion Arm 1 ( Unasyn ) Arm 2 ( ampicillin/gentamicin ) . She treat per standard care tylenol , intravenous fluid , labor manage per physician discretion . From time diagnosis chorioamnionitis determination treatment success failure postpartum period , patient receive intravenous antibiotic per protocol arm assign . If patient already receive ampicillin GBS , ampicillin discontinue study drug initiate . In arm 1 , study drug consist Unasyn 3 gram intravenously every 6 hour , plus intravenous normal saline placebo dose every 8 hour . In arm 2 , study drug consist gentamicin 1.5mg/kg intravenously every 8 hour plus ampicillin 2gm intravenously every 6 hour . For patient , clindamycin give intravenously time clamp umbilical cord event cesarean delivery , continue part antibiotic regimen per standard care cesarean section set chorioamnionitis . With exception saline placebo dos , Unasyn regimen ampicillin/gentamicin regimen efficacious widely utilized regimen treatment intrapartum chorioamnionitis , represent deviation standard care . After delivery , patient experience treatment failure define , medical care manage discretion attend physician per standard care , antibiotic regimen unblinded . After delivery , prior discharge hospital , patient ask answer short questionnaire enquire side effect experience treatment chorioamnionitis .
