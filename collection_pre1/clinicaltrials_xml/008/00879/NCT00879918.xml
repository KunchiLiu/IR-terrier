	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize African Americans ( AAs ) smoke positive reinforcement nicotine `` peak-seeking '' pattern smoking ( smoke individual cigarette intensively great intake nicotine tobacco smoke toxin ) , white smoke negative reinforcement `` trough-maintaining '' pattern ( avoid withdrawal maintain consistent nicotine level throughout day mean regular smoke pattern ) . The investigator believe pattern link identifiable racial difference nicotine pharmacology associate racial difference responses pharmacologic intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Smoking major preventable cause cancer , premature cardiovascular disease chronic obstructive lung disease , reproductive problem infection . AA smoker substantially high risk cancer reproductive disorder compare white . A recently publish large cohort study ( 183,000 subject ) find two-fold high incidence lung cancer AAs compare white ( cigarette consumption level &lt; 10 11-20 CPD , &gt; 30 CPD ) ( 1 ) . Several line evidence indicate AAs highly addict cigarette smoking white . AAs likely smoke first cigarette within 10 minute awaken , indicator severity dependence . ( 2 ) They likely want quit smoking likely try quit ( attempts last least 24 hour ) , ( 3 ) significantly less likely white successful abstainer one year . The quit ratio ( former smokers/ever smoker ) recently report 37.3 % AAs compare 51 % white . ( 2 ) Research suggest AAs , smoke few CPD take nicotine per cigarette , behave like peak-seekers ( smoke primarily direct nicotine-mediated positive reinforcement ) . In contrast , white , smoke CPD less nicotine intake per cigarette , behave like trough-maintainers ( seek maintain consistent nicotine level day , presumably avoid withdrawal symptom and/or desensitize receptor ) . Studies laboratory show AAs metabolize nicotine , great extent , cotinine , slowly white ( 7,10 ) slow metabolism CYP2A6 glucuronidation pathway . We use 3HC/COT ratio measure blood urine several study show CYP2A6 activity lower AAs compare white , include among child . More 90 CYP2A6 gene variant identify . Although many uncommon activity determine ( 12 ) , associate large individual difference rate nicotine metabolism ( 13 ) . Studies CYP2A6 genetics AAs recently report . It unclear whether report gene variant AAs explain substantial difference nicotine especially cotinine metabolism observe prior study . A comprehensive study nicotine cotinine kinetics metabolism IV dose relation genotype , recently conduct white , propose understand metabolism nicotine AAs .</detailed_description>
