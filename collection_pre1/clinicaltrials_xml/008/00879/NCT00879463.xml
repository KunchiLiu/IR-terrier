	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate whether use brain tissue oxygen saturation monitor lead reduction intra-operative use pack red cell unit . Patients randomly allocate group A B . In group A INVOS monitoring available . In group B , access INVOS attend anesthesiologist . An `` observer '' anesthesiologist access INVOS provide information consider necessary . For BOTH GROUPS : During CBP aortic unclamping , PRC give hemoglobin &gt; 7g/dl . For value less 5.5g/dl , one unit PRC transfuse patient reevaluate . After wean CPB retransfusion salvage shed blood , transfusion hemoglobin &lt; 8g/dl . During ICU stay , transfusion hemoglobin &lt; 8g/dl . Between 8-10g/dl evaluation transfusion multimodal manner . For GROUP A : As CBP aortic unclamping , hemoglobin 5.5-7g/dl , transfusion INVOS le 60 % . For GROUP B : As CBP aortic unclamping , hemoglobin 5.5-7g/dl , decision transfusion take attend anesthesiologist ( judgment ) .</detailed_description>
