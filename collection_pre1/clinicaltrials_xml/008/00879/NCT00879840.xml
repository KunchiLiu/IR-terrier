	<brief_summary>Background : - Endometrial ovarian cancer , respectively , fourth eighth common cancer among woman United States . Although routine Pap test may detect presence cancer cell , convince early detection approach either cancer . Better method detection need . - Two possible method cancer detection involve sample take tampon special kind brush , call Tao brush . Researchers would like know well method work . Objectives : - To assess quality DNA collect tampon Tao brush sample method . - To detect genetic marker collect DNA determine marker related individual cancer status . Eligibility : - Women age 45 year old confirm suspect endometrial ovarian cancer , surgery . - A control group postmenopausal woman surgery benign gynecological condition include . Design : - Shortly hysterectomy extensive procedure treat either cancer benign condition : - A tampon insert vagina collect cell sample , remove 30 minute . - After tampon remove , cervix swab Tao brush collect cell sample . - Following hysterectomy , sample healthy cancerous tissue take , tested researcher .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Currently , convince early detection approach endometrial ovarian cancer . Although well establish endometrial ovarian tumor shed cytologically recognizable cell routinely prepared Pap test , clear approach rarely detect occult tumor . Accordingly , effort develop mean collect biological sample high patient acceptability , good sensitivity detect early disease , excellent specificity need . Objectives : In project , want assess feasibility use alternative sample technique combination molecular assay detect endometrial ovarian cancer . We compare sample use Tampon sheathe endometrial brush , Tao brush . We want assess quality DNA extract different sampler . We assess correlation methylation somatic DNA select marker panel cancer status . Eligibility : We wish include 117 woman age 45 year older suspect endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , 53 age-matched ( plus/minus 5 year ) control without malignancy , refer surgery Mayo clinic . Design : We plan conduct pilot study woman confirm suspected endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer , woman treat benign condition . DNA extract sample collect use vaginal Tampon endometrial brush use FDA approve device ( Tao brush ) prior surgery . A panel methylation marker analyze sample yield sufficient DNA . The result methylation analysis compare final histology patient study . We set detection methylation one loci 50 % woman arm technical success .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The study enroll total 170 woman consent hysterectomy . One hundred seventeen ( 117 ) either 1 ) suspect ovarian cancer base clinical impression , cytologic histologic diagnosis ( effusion , Pap test biopsy ) , 2 ) suspect endometrial cancer base biopsy diagnose atypical endometrial hyperplasia ( equivalent endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia ) , endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma ( i.e . insitu/ early serous carcinoma ) carcinoma . Fiftythree ( 53 ) undergo definitive treatment benign condition ( uterine fibroid , benign appear adnexal pathology normal CA 125 , pelvic floor dysfunction exceed grade 1 2 uterine descensus ) . Since analyzed cancer occur child , include study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Surgical candidate recurrent disease Preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy History tubal ligation , salpingitis , hysterectomy ( ovarian cancer patient ) Control patient less 45 year age . Patients receive treatment active endometriosis . Cervical stenosis recognize clinically accept Tao Brush Endometrial sample within 5 day anticipate surgery Prior history endometrial ablation Patients cervical cancer</criteria>
