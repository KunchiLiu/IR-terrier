	<brief_summary>Progerias rare `` premature age '' diseases child die severe atherosclerosis lead stroke heart attack . It multisystem disease objective clinical marker disease progression . These include abnormality growth body composition , bone mineral density , join function , endocrine function , alopecia , vascular disease . There currently therapy proven effective progressive deleterious aspect disorder . Progeria cause gene defect gene LMNA , cod nuclear protein lamin A. Lamin A normally express differentiated cell , require posttranslational farnesylation incorporate nuclear membrane . This trial propose use three agent ( zoledronic acid , pravastatin , lonafarnib ) inhibit farnesylation abnormal lamin , disease cause protein Progeria . The primary objective study evaluate feasibility administer intravenous zoledronic acid , oral pravastatin oral lonafarnib , patient wtih Progeria minimum 4 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Zoledronic Acid , Pravastatin , Lonafarnib Patients With Progeria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label single arm feasibility trial . A combination two oral agent ( pravastatin lonafarnib ) one intravenous ( IV ) agent ( zoledronic acid ) administer dos schedule currently apply pediatrics . These agent target farnesylation pathway different point . Our goal inhibit farnesylation abnormal lamin , disease-causing protein Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome progeroid laminopathies ( henceforth `` progeria '' ) . The drug include intravenous bisphosphonate zoledronic acid , oral HMG co-reductase inhibitor pravastatin oral farnesyltransferase inhibitor ( FTI ) lonafarnib ( SCH 66336 ) . Patients genetically confirm progeria eligible protocol . Treatment initiate 4 week duration may extend depend tolerability . This study assess feasibility treatment regimen first 4 week . If tolerate 4 week , patient treat regimen 6 month .</detailed_description>
