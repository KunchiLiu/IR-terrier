	<brief_title>VA106483 Alpha Blocker Interaction Study Elderly Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VA106483 intend use treatment patient suffer nocturia ( define wake urinate least per night period sleep ) . Nocturia condition often worsen sufferer get old . This may due over-active bladder muscle , bladder able hold less urine night-time production urine bladder night . Some treatment available nocturia side-effects make unsuitable elderly patient .

Nocturia commonly associate Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy ( BPH , non-cancerous enlargement prostate gland , often result problem pass water ) . Of patient suffer BPH , estimate 40-85 % experience symptom wake night pas water . Treatments commonly prescribe BPH include alpha-blocker work improve urine flow muscle relaxant effect . Alpha-blockers know cause hypotension ( lower blood pressure cause dizziness patient ) . Since likely subject may co-prescribed VA106483 alpha-blocker , purpose study determine give VA106483 increase hypotensive effect alpha-blocker</detailed_description>
