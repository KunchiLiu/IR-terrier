	<brief_summary>Background : Heparin anticoagulant commonly use neonatal population mean prevent catheter relate occlusion malfunction thrombosis ( clot ) . Given recent overdoses infant use heparin , concern whether heparin use peripherally inserted central venous catheter ( PICC ) . Scientific evidence compare duration use heparin versus heparin PICCs conflicting . Purpose : The purpose study evaluate effect continuous IV fluid heparin versus IV fluid without heparin duration percutaneously inserted central venous catheter ( PICC ) neonates . Design : Prospective , double-blind , randomize control trial Hypothesis : The use heparin PICC fluid difference duration catheter patency . Design Methods : The study conduct Neonatal Intensive Care Unit University Hospital , San Antonio , TX . Randomization either experimental group ( no-heparin ) standard medical group ( heparin ) occur parental consent obtain prior PICC insertion . PICC placement do PICC certify neonatal nurse . Correct placement PICC assure radiography standard procedure . Parents , NICU team member staff , investigator mask group . Pharmacy responsible randomization . Both heparin group heparin group solution dispense identical container , compound pharmacy . The study medication , heparin , mixed pharmacy standard dose 0.5 units/mL intravenous infusion use heparin group . The experimental group receive base solution , whether 5 % dextrose , 0.9 % sodium chloride , total parenteral nutrition infuse PICC line . Pharmacy NICU staff ensure compatibility heparin infusion . Heparin bond catheter , heparin flush , hep-lock solution use NICU service . The primary outcome , duration catheter use , defined time ( hour ) insertion removal catheter due occlusion . Occlusion define inability push 1 mL 0.9 % sodium chloride , via 5 mL syringe , catheter situ detection clot along catheter removal . Secondary outcome include septicemia vs. catheter-related septicemia , phlebitis , death discharge , thrombosis . Septicemia identify clinical sign symptom associate sepsis presence positive peripheral blood culture obtain irrespective catheter tip culture result . Catheter-related sepsis define positive blood culture obtain catheter fluid well positive blood culture obtain peripheral venous specimen . Both culture must demonstrate organism . Phlebitis define visual detection , swell , change skin color associate inflamed vein . Thrombosis define thrombus along catheter path diagnose visual inspection upon removal catheter . Elective versus non-elective removal also record . Adverse event monitor include : heparin induce thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) , define platelet count drop 50 x 103/mL positive antibody titer , aPTT &gt; 100 second ( This measure upon clinical evidence bleeding ) , hemorrhage &gt; 2 site , intraventricular hemorrhage , extravasation , dislodgement breakage catheter . The sample size determine base retrospective data collection reach statistical power 80 % type I error 0.05 . The investigator expect sample size approximately 102 patient arm study . The study terminate PICC discontinue indication stop study early safety reason . These could include increased adverse event one group versus . A Safety Control Panel compose 2 neonatologists another site review data point 1/3 2/3 total patient enrollment achieve . Data Collection Analysis : Data collect tabulated Microsoft Excel spreadsheet use unique patient identifier store secure location UHS analyze use appropriate statistical test .</brief_summary>
