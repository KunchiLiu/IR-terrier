	<detailed_description>There sound evidence quetiapine effective treatment manic depressive episode associate Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) ( Yatham et al 2006 ) . However , even development effective new treatment option , patient respond treatment available . Biological marker investigate predictor response treatment remission symptom . This would explain part individual 's difference response treatment , take account genetic variability plus environmental factor influence specific biological marker . A potential biological marker response treatment BD would level neurotrophins , , fact , alter acute mood episode ( Cunha et al 2006 ) . Among neurotrophins , Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) repeatedly consistently report associated BD physiopathology ( Post 2007 ) . Furthermore , medication know effective BD , like lithium divalproex , increase BDNF level . Diverse source evidence provide support alteration BDNF mood disorder : - Patients major depressive disorder show low level BDNF treatment antidepressant recover level back normal . ( Gonul et al 2005 ) . - Studies brain tissue ( post-mortem ) show BDNF level decrease antidepressant . ( Karege et al 2002 ) . - The polymorphism BDNF gene associate response treatment lithium maintenance phase . ( Rybakowski et al . 2005 ) . - Our group show BDNF level decrease mania depression , remission ( Cunha et al 2006 , Machado-Vieira et al . 2007 ) . Therefore , BDNF appear involve mechanism acute mood episode . - Treatment mood stabilizer , lithium divalproex , increase BDNF level ( Frey et al . 2006 ) . Prediction drug treatment response base variation genetic make rapidly grow area . However , study examine association single nucleotide polymorphisms drug response bipolar disorder . The design study offer unique opportunity examine genetic predictor drug response . Interestingly , single nucleotide polymorphism nucleotide196 ( G/A ) human BDNF gene codon 66 ( Val66Met ) report associated predisposition BD family-based study ( Rybakowski et al 2006 , Green et al 2006 ) . In human , polymorphism produce valine - - methionine substitution proBDNF protein reduce traffic secretion BDNF protein . This relevant estimate 20-30 % human population heterozygous Met polymorphism BDNF . Furthermore , consistent finding BD regard association Val66Met polymorphism BDNF gene prefrontal cognitive impairment , recently confirm large sample bipolar subject ( Rybakowski et al 2006 ) . In addition , crosssectional study show polymorphism BDNF gene ( Val66Met ) associate response lithium prophylaxis , finding universal ( Rybakowski et al 2005 , Masui et al 2006 ) . However , need prospective study order confirm finding . It possible single polymorphism BDNF gene would negative impact BDNF level , consequently , negative impact response treatment . Despite consistent evidence change BDNF level mood episode treatment , one important aspect remain unknown : Whether change BDNF level require treatment response whether magnitude change happen portion response treatment remission symptom . The hypothesis project patient good response treatment one show great increase BDNF level earlier course treatment , less likely present polymorphism BDNF gene . Given context , aim investigate BDNF level prospectively patient BD , , treatment quetiapine compare measure response treatment , indicated remission symptom . We also aim investigate polymorphism BDNF gene ( Val66Met ) correlation BDNF serum level treatment response .</detailed_description>
