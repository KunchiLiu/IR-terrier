	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel prednisone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving docetaxel prednisone together sunitinib malate may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This pilot phase I/II trial study side effect best way give docetaxel prednisone together sunitinib malate see well work treat patient prostate cancer progress hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Taxotere/Prednisone Plus Sunitinib Chemotherapy-Naïve , Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) docetaxel/prednisone plus sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) chemotherapy-naive , hormone refractory prostate cancer subject biochemical relapse . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate ( ORR ) duration response ( DR ) subject measurable disease . II . To determine overall survival ( OS ) time progression ( TTP ) . III . To evaluate safety tolerability sunitinib combination docetaxel prednisone . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 , prednisone orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-21 , sunitinib malate PO daily ( QD ) day 2-15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive sunitinib malate PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
