	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVES : Primary Objectives 1.To evaluate safety feasibility sequential use DNA methyltransferase ( DNMT ) inhibitor ( decitabine ) target biological agent EGFR ( panitumumab ) KRAS wild type tumor second third line treatment advance metastatic colorectal cancer . Secondary Objectives 1 . To examine re-expression reduction promoter methylation gene involve tumor suppressor pathway know important colorectal cancer ( CRC ) involve EGFR signal pathway . 2 . Evaluate overall response ( OR = CR +PR ) accord RECIST criterion 2 , 4 , 6 cycle . Progression free survival , measure first evidence tumor growth start treatment also assess . 3 . Measure CEA level begin cycle examine correlate treatment response disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>KRAS Wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients metastatic colorectal cancer living longer run therapeutic option due disease resistance . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) validate therapeutic target colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Ligand bind EGFR activate RAS/RAF/MAPK , STAT , PI3K/AKT signal pathway , together modulate cellular proliferation , adhesion , migration , survival . Anti-EGFR targeted antibody cetuximab panitumumab administer monotherapy CRC show response rate approximately 9 % 17 % respectively ( Amado et al. , 2008 ; Saltz et al. , 2004 ) . Single agent panitumumab approve use third line colorectal cancer show improve progression free survival supportive care . Further subset analysis show response rate 17 % confined patient KRAS wild type tumor group ( approximately 60-70 % CRC patient ) consider study ( Amado et al. , 2008 ) . According Huntsman Cancer Hospital registry , colorectal cancer patient large disease group within gastrointestinal cancer group many eventually progress available therapy become intolerant side effect second line therapy oxaliplatin neuropathy irinotecan induce diarrhea , yet still candidate treatment . In lab translational research study , hope identify re-expression reduction promoter methylation gene involve tumor suppressor pathway know important colorectal cancer ( CRC ) involve EGFR signal pathway . Candidate gene evaluate include gene describe prior study associate CpG island methylator phenotype ( CIMP ) well gene previously report hypermethylated association colorectal neoplasia . These include APC , SFRP family member , CDH-1 ( e-cadherin ) p16 ( Belshaw et al. , 2008 ; Lind et al. , 2004 ; Suehiro et al. , 2008 ) . Other gene specific EGFR KRAS signal assess include : RASSF1A , tumor suppressor gene know hypermethylated several human cancer include CRC , occasionally associate KRAS wild type silence methylation allows RAS activation ( Kang et al. , 2006 ; Oliveira et al. , 2005 ) ; SOX17 , member transcription factor superfamily know hypermethylated CRC lead disrupt Wnt signal ( Zhang et al. , 2008 ) ; SOCS-1 negative regulator STAT3 activate ligand EGFR show silenced hypermethylation allow constitutive signal via EGFR ( Lee et al. , 2006 ) ; PTEN , tumor suppressor antagonize PI3K- AKT/PKB signal pathway dephosphorylating phosphoinositides ( Noro et al. , 2007 ) . Further candidate gene may discover add base preliminary data ongoing research . Methylation analysis gene expression pattern change do use methylation specific PCR bisulfite sequence gene know involved EGFR signal pathway colorectal neoplasia describe . We prior data work well others suggest use hypomethylating agent resensitize colon cancer cell therapeutic agent ( Karpf et al. , 1999 ; Morita et al. , 2006 ) . The translational component research support institutional translational grant award PI , Kimberly Jones , July 1st , 2008 . This information may help identify important target allow design good combination therapy . We plan assays weekly blood buccal sample patient therapy , epithelial cell swab panitumumab associate skin rash , archive biopsied tumor specimen available ( KRAS test ( require ) optional end-of treatment biopsy ) . The pharmacokinetic profile decitabine well describe offer several possible dose schedule feasible clinical practice combination agent . Decitabine currently test combination standard cytotoxic agent . It show activity solid tumor , however , myelosuppression common side effect , especially give concurrently myelosuppressive therapy ( carboplatin ) ( Appleton et al. , 2007 ; Plimack et al. , 2007 ) . We propose novel study use decitabine combination non-myelosuppressive targeted biological agent well give sequentially rather concurrently try maximize effect second drug dose demethylation window . In dose-finding study report Appleton et al. , recommend dose 90 mg/m2 6 hour every 28 day , go high 135 mg/m2 combine carboplatin ( Appleton et al. , 2007 ) . We choose dose 45 mg/m2 decitabine every 14 day base report safety biological equivalence study . There grade 3 4 hematological toxicity observe 3 patient infuse 45 mg/m2 decitabine follow 5 AUC carboplatin ; 1 episode grade 3 leukopenia 1 grade 3 neutropenia 4 patient infuse 45 mg/m2 decitabine follow 6 AUC carboplatin ( Appleton et al. , 2007 ) . At high dose 90 mg/m2 5 AUC carboplatin 13 patient , 5 episode grade 4 leukopenia neutropenia observe ; 10 patient 90 mg/m2 6 AUC carboplatin , 4 episode grade 4 leukopenia neutropenia . The propose infusion 2 hour create infusion rate toxicity schedule patient tolerate . Daily low dose infusion use hematological disorder maybe efficacious daily intravenous chemotherapy impact patient 's quality life significantly . Decitabine also elimination half-life 30 minute , clear body rapidly . The propose administration decitabine twice , half dose , 28-day period well tolerate 90 mg/m2 combine carboplatin . The myelosuppressive toxicity main toxicity decitabine less significant combined second myelosuppressive agent carboplatin . Low dose decitabine ( 45 mg/m2 ) nearly equivalent hypomethylating effect 90 mg/m2 blood buccal cell . The frequent dosing ( every 2 week versus every 4 week ) maintain hypomethylating effect low dose . Additionally , propose novel dose schedule second agent , panitumumab , give alternate week target EGFR pathway hypomethylated prior decitabine treatment . Our work well others , demonstrate specific promoter hypomethylation observe 8-14 day start treatment genomic DNA reverts baseline level 28 35 day start treatment ( Appleton et al. , 2007 ; Samlowski et al. , 2005 , Kantarjian , 2007 # 23 ) . We also assess clinical response progression free survival ( PFS ) compare historical control patient treat panitumumab monotherapy . If combination give safely response see equal well single agent panitumumab data , would plan multi-center large phase II trial .</detailed_description>
