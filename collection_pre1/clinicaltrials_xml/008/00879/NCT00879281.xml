Until , research fail identify effectiveness write individualize Action Plan ( AP ) achieve . The current multicenter , single-blind RCT follow-up period 6 month , evaluate hypothesis individualize AP 's reduce exacerbation recovery time . Patients include regular respiratory nurse visit allocate either usual care additional AP provide individualized treatment prescription ( pharmaceutical non-pharmaceutical ) relate colour cod symptom status ( reinforcement 1 4 month ) .
