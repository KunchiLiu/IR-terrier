	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - Test maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Bendamustine whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) - To determine plasma pharmacokinetics ( blood test see much drug get patient 's system long last system ) Bendamustine - To determine presence Bendamustine cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) ( fluid brain spinal cord ) study patient Bendamustine approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia . However , Bendamustine use study investigational agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Bendamustine Concurrent Whole Brain Radiation Brain Metastases From Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bendamustine start first group dose 60 mg/m² ; patient group 2 give Bendamustine dose 80 mg/m² ; patient Group 3 give Bendamustine 100 mg/m² . Each cohort receive Bendamustine weekly total 4 week . Approximately 3-6 patient enrol study receive lumbar puncture . Patients tell study enrollment whether lumbar puncture withdraw CSF .</detailed_description>
