	<brief_summary>The study use molecule particle find cancer cell unique cancer cell , detect normal tissue . The molecule know `` oncofetal antigen '' OFA . Because OFA unique cancer , investigator feel OFA could use educate patient ' defense effectively fight cancer , harbor . Although investigator find OFA present large concentration cancer , find especially abundant breast cancer . Therefore , investigator feel molecule would good target stimulate patient defense especially breast cancer cell . To accomplish , certain defense cell ( immune cell ) wash patient ' blood use machine patient connect two small cannula place vein locate patient ' arm cell manipulate laboratory artificially engineer OFA . These `` reeducated '' cell inject skin patient . There series three skin injection 4 week interval . It hop treatment convert patient ' defense point effective anti-cancer response induce . Effectiveness treatment monitor blood test assessment size cancer .</brief_summary>
