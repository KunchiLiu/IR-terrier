	<brief_title>Burn Micronutrient Repletion Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Burn injury patient undergo series metabolic event , untreated , could lead severe physical impairment even death . Antioxidants minimize free radical damage neutralize chemical reaction well promote cellular repair . Currently consistent protocol micronutrient repletion adult burn patient . The aim study evaluate effectiveness current vitamin regimen comparison novel vitamin mineral supplementation protocol develop research team . Dosages oral intravenous supplementation base current literature . The combination intravenous enteral treatment important due gastrointestinal mucosal swell related post-burn fluid resuscitation . Measurable health outcome include rate infection , length hospital stay , mortality rate , hospital cost , number day intensive care unit , number ventilator-dependent day wound heal . The investigator hypothesize use novel vitamin mineral supplement regimen improve adult burn patient outcome .</detailed_description>
