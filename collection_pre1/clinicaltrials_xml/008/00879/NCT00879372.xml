	<brief_title>Efficacy Adjunctive Tianeptine Treatment Bipolar Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One main challenge treatment Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) achieve good function outcome syndromal recovery . Available treatment reasonably effective reduce acute symptom , many time syndromal recovery accompany restoration function capability . This particularly true bipolar depression , responsible burden associate BD . Even treatment-responsive patient , remain symptomatically well extend period time , frequently demonstrate sub-threshold symptom continue psychosocial morbidity cognitive impairment . The cognitive impairment persist interepisode period stand major correlate functional impairment , may core aspect BD pathophysiology . Beyond , cognitive impairment worsens cumulative episode . Functional morphometric study show change amygdala , hippocampus prefrontal cortex patient bipolar disorder . Effective treatment bipolar disorder , lithium divalproex , prove prevent cellular atrophy , antiapoptotic property increase BDNF level . Findings neuropathological study confirm reduction dysgenesis neuronal cell line hippocampus bipolar disorder . Ultimately , main challenge treatment BD translate knowledge neuronal plasticity neurobiology illness novel therapeutic option . In context , tianeptine stand therapeutic agent unique property , match condition find BD . The neurochemical property tianeptine vary tricyclic non-tricyclic antidepressant . Noteworthy , none current available medication BD show feature : 1 ) tianeptine exert opposite effect chronic stress neuron , increase neuroprotective factor may help quench cycle affective episode recurrence neural deterioration ; 2 ) tianeptine affect neuroplasticity hippocampus report increase dendritic length ; 3 ) tianeptine increase BDNF level amygdala ; 4 ) tianeptine attenuate stress-induced glutamate release amygdala ; 5 ) tianeptine anticonvulsant property via adenosinergic A1 receptor ; 6 ) tianeptine analgesic effect . In present research project , plan conduct enriched maintenance study use tianeptine adjunctive therapy bipolar depression . All participant receive tianeptine open label manner period two month , follow assign randomly treatment tianeptine placebo double-blind fashion six month . All patient remain treatment usual duration trial . This trial allow investigation efficacy tolerability tianeptine 37.5mg/day adjunctive treatment bipolar depression impact clinical variable associate aftermath bipolar depression episode . Considering tianeptine approve use orally humans market depression , low risk intervention use novel approach may provide clinical trial . Along clinical response , prospectively evaluate improvement work declarative memory , two cognitive prefrontal- hippocampus-dependent process , respectively , effect tianeptine serum BDNF level .</detailed_description>
