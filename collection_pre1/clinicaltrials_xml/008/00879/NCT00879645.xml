	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 pharmacokinetic study assess pharmacokinetics IK-1001 healthy volunteer well subject vary degree impair renal function follow single intravenous infusion . A total 28 subject enrol study , include 6 normal subject ( Creatinine Clearance ( CrCL ) &gt; 80 mL/min ) , 9 subject mild impairment ( CrCL ≥ 50 &lt; 80 mL/min ) , 6 subject intermediate impairment ( ≥ 30 &lt; 50 mL/min ) 7 subject severe impairment ( CrCL &lt; 30 mL/min ) . Mild , moderate normal healthy subject receive IK-1001 single IV infusion 3 hour 1.5 mg/kg/hr . Blood , plasma , urine exhale air collect subject 48 hour follow-up visit ( Day 7 ) , evaluate pharmacokinetics Hydrogen Sulfide ( H2S ) ( exhaled air ) , IK-1001 ( blood ) thiosulfate plasma urine . Severe subject receive IK-1001 single IV infusion 3 hour 1.0 mg/kg/hr . For dose cohort , study consist screen visit ( Days -28 -1 ) , treatment visit ( Day 0 ( check-in ) Day 3 ) , follow-up ( exit ) visit day 7 ( +/- 2 day ) . Study subject enrol one 4 cohort receive investigational product give dose level . The subject consider enrol study randomization . IK-1001 administer healthcare professional intravenously 3 hour use infusion pump . Dosage IK-1001 administer actual body weight basis , accord cohort assignment use subject 's body weight determined Day -1 . After end initial 3-hour study period , subject observed additional 45 hour period discharge unit .</detailed_description>
