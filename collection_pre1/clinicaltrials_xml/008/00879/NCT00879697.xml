	<brief_summary>Background : Muscle atrophy reduce leg strength relate exercise intolerance patient intermittent claudication ( IC ) , suggest strength training ( ST ) could improve exercise performance patient . Objective : Analyze effect ST walk capacity patient IC compare walk training ( WT ) effect . Intervention : Patients randomize ST WT . Both group train twice week , 12 week , rate perceive exertion . ST consist 3 set 10 repetition whole body exercise . WT consist 15 two-minute bout walk intercalate 2 minute rest . Measurements : Walking capacity , peak VO2 , walk economy , ankle brachial index , ischemic window knee extension strength</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Strength Training Walking Tolerance Intermittent Claudication Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From July 2005 December 2006 , three hundred patient peripheral arterial disease , enrol tertiary center specialize vascular disease able walk least 2 minute 2 mile per hour , invited meeting explanation study give . 80 patient attend meeting , 60 decide take part study , 52 attend screening test . Patients include study meet follow criterion : Fontaine stage II peripheral arterial disease , symptom IC least 6 month , ankle/brachial index ( ABI ) rest ≤ 0.90 1 2 leg , reduction ABI treadmill test , exercise tolerance limit IC . Patients exclude follow condition : presence chronic lung disease , inability obtain ABI measurement due noncompressible vessel , exercise tolerance limit factor claudication ( eg , dyspnea orthopedic problem ) , poorly control blood pressure , presence electrocardiogram response suggestive myocardial ischemia exercise test , history revascularization previous year . Procedures Patients randomly ( draw lot ) divide 2 group : strength ( ST , n = 17 ) walking ( WT , n = 17 ) training . They evaluate baseline ( pre-training ) 12 week exercise training ( post-training ) . During evaluation assess exercise tolerance strength . Both training program ( ST WT ) supervise , conduct twice week , last 12 week , start 2-week preconditioning-orientation phase . In program , rate perceive exertion exercise keep similar 11 13 the15-grade Borg scale . Furthermore , duration exercise session prescribe 30 min exercise ST WT group .</detailed_description>
