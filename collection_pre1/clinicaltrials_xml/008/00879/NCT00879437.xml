	<brief_summary>Currently , effective treatment follow aggressive brain tumor : glioblastoma multiforme , anaplastic astrocytoma , gliomatosis cerebri , gliosarcoma , brainstem glioma . Surgery radiation generally slow aggressive brain tumor , majority patient , tumor start grow 6-12 month . Adding chemotherapy drug surgery radiation clearly improve cure rate child malignant glioma . The investigator conduct study see combination valproic acid bevacizumab ( also know AvastinTM ) surgery radiation shrink brain tumor effectively improve chance cure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Valproic Acid Radiation Followed Maintenance Valproic Acid Bevacizumab Children With High Grade Gliomas Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With exception patient brainstem glioma , patient maximal surgical resection safely perform prior study entry . Submission frozen tumor strongly encourage . After recovery neurosurgery , patient start valproic acid radiation therapy . Valproic Acid ( VPA ) : VPA start 15 mg/kg/day divide three dos day , ideally 48 hour prior first day radiation therapy , later first day radiation therapy . Patients may also begin VPA sooner post-operative seizure require anti-convulsant . Radiation Phase : Radiation therapy begin within 30 day definitive surgery radiographic diagnosis , whichever later date . Date surgery radiographic diagnosis consider day 1 , radiation start later day 31 . VPA continue daily without interruption radiation therapy . VPA dose adjust increment 5 mg/kg/day every 3-5 day achieve maintain trough concentration 85 115 mcg/ml . During time patient receive standard radiation therapy . Post Radiation Phase : Patients continue receive VPA radiation . If necessary , patient delay radiation ( e.g. , secondary schedule holiday need new mask make ) complete radiotherapy total prescribed protocol dose . Maintenance Phase : Maintenance therapy begin 4 week completion radiation week 11 , whichever come first . Patients continue VPA daily maintenance therapy . All patient start bevacizumab , 10 mg/kg vein every two week , start maintenance therapy . Maintenance therapy continue uninterrupted laboratory test continue meet on-study criterion . In absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression , patient continue receive protocol treatment maximum total duration two year ( include radiation phase ) .</detailed_description>
