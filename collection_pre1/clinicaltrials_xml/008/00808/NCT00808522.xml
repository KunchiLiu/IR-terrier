	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether hCG result decrease breast density . High breast density associate increase risk breast cancer . It also show decrease density drug call tamoxifen result decrease risk breast cancer . The investigator look effect hCG breast density people increase risk develop breast cancer theory postulate hormonal action hCG tamoxifen would great reduction breast density patient treat hCG tamoxifen versus patient treat tamoxifen alone .

	<detailed_description>Pregnancy associate decrease risk breast cancer . This reproduced multiple study see multiple race . People evaluate different hormone practice associate pregnancy determine factor reduce risk develop breast cancer patient . These pronounced finding evaluate great detail multiple scientist one hormone think might associate reduction breast cancer hCG . This statement back multiple study look direct effect hCG growth death breast cancer cell lab animal model breast cancer . We want determine hCG give patient increase risk breast cancer result accentuate decrease breast cancer risk beyond effect receive conventional breast cancer reduce protocol . Our final outcome study breast density mammographic evaluation consider marker breast cancer . So study evaluate whether hCG effect mammographic breast density . After recruitment two group study intervention group non intervention group . In intervention group patient would undergo period hCG injection would last total 60 day consist 30 subcutaneous injection . The non intervention group continue conventional chemoprevention medication . Both group follow teo year image , cytology blood sample send labs evaluation .</detailed_description>
