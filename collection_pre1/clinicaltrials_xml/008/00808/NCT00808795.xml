	<brief_summary>- Contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) third common cause hospital acquire acute kidney injury , account 10 % case . - The pathophysiology CIN unclear . Possible mechanisms involve 1 . Renal tubular injury oxygen free radical 2 . Reducing renal blood flow lead acute tubular necrosis . Since N-acetylcysteine antioxidant well vasodilator , may work two distinct way , prevent reduction renal blood flow contrast-induced oxidative damage . - The purpose study evaluate efficacy N-acetylcysteine compare placebo contrast-induced nephropathy prevention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) third common cause hospital acquire acute kidney injury , account 10 % case . Nevertheless , use radiocontrast medium associate increase in-hospital morbidity , mortality , cost medical care , long admission , especially patient need dialysis . With increase use contrast medium diagnostic interventional procedure , become one major challenge encounter routine cardiovascular practice . - Patients great risk CIN define preexist impaired renal function diabetes mellitus incidence estimate high 50 % . Preventive therapy primarily include limitation contrast exposure , intravenous volume expansion saline solution , use low- iso-osmolality contrast medium . - However , since measure provide incomplete protection CIN , interest emerge number adjunction short-term pharmacotherapy method . Among , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) considerable interest . Up , several clinical study meta-analysis perform assess efficacy NAC prevention CIN . - In spite heterogeneity regard efficacy administration NAC , several study advise use NAC , especially high risk patient , regard low cost , availability side effect . Since administration NAC necessitate earlier long admission patient , particularly intravenous use , increase health care cost . In addition , evidence intervention even harmful patient diabetes mellitus . - So , seem need evidence efficacy cost-effectiveness NAC patient high risk development CIN make rational clinical decision individual patient well policy decision health general public .</detailed_description>
