	<brief_summary>The specific aim project enroll 10,000 subject genomes survey use Navigenicsâ„¢ Health Compass technology . The Navigenics Health Compass help understand genetic variant say future health , give action step take control health today . In addition , investigator assess Navigenics Health Compass , result affect lifestyle decision . The phenotyping information analyze result Navigenics genotype information assist identify genetic variation associate trait disease . The us molecular marker cholesterol glucose level assess disease risk well establish clinical medicine today . Although tools useful screen subclinical disease , predictive value limit . Until recently , molecular marker best risk assessment screening tool existence . Since completion Human Genome Project , era personalize medicine , exploit knowledge gene individual carry may predispose him/her disease , come forefront research . The Navigenics Health Compass technology ass risk 20 common disease provide subject accurate assessment individual predictive risk develop condition traditional biomarkers cholesterol glucose level . This may positively influence change lifestyle , well decision seek medical evaluation associate preventive strategy .</brief_summary>
