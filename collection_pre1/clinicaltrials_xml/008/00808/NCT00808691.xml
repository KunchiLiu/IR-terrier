	<brief_summary>As medicine advance , many life save intensive care unit . However , multiple organ failure occur , mortality rate patient increase dramatically . Therefore , major goal intensive care unit prevent occurrence multiple organ failure . The sepsis protocol early goal direct treatment great effect reduce development multiple organ failure decrease mortality rate . However , sometime condition patient deteriorate spite mean blood pressure mixed venous oxygen saturation normal . Some expert recognize might microcirculatory dysfunction tissue organ . The dysfunction microcirculation might due vasoconstriction microthrombosis . Vasoconstriction might result systemic inflammation , reactive oxygen specie , dysfunction synthesis NO ( nitric oxide ) . Microthrombosis might result systemic inflammation , reactive oxygen specie , imbalance coagulatory system , damage endothelial cell . In clinical practice , oxidative stress relate circulatory shock , sepsis , acute lung injury , acute respiratory distress syndrome . This study try investigate relation oxidative stress microcirculation . Furthermore , investigator try investigate correlation severity oxidative stress microcirculatory dysfunction severity disease prognosis . The investigator hope study help figure picture disease progression patient . It may conduct study modulate oxidative stress , improve microcirculatory function , finally improve outcome patient .</brief_summary>
