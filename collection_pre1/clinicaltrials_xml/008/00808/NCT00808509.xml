	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Feasibility Discontinuation Adalimumab Stable Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients Clinical Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatments adalimumab tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) blocker , start therapy rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , usually continue indefinitely . Information concern possibility discontinue anti-TNF therapy RA patient remission limit . This pilot study one country study effect adalimumab discontinuation . The objective ass proportion patient establish RA stable remission ( Disease Activity Score [ DAS ] 28 &lt; 2.6 ) treatment adalimumab combination methotrexate , possible discontinue adalimumab compare remission rate among patient sustain therapy adalimumab + methotrexate remission rate among patient discontinue adalimumab . Rheumatoid arthritis patient stable remission ( DAS28 &lt; 2.6 ) treat adalimumab + methotrexate randomize 1:1 ratio continue adalimumab treatment discontinue adalimumab treatment follow 52 week . Subsequently observational extension conduct observe patient treat discretion investigator . The observational extension period last Weeks 105 - 156 ( average Week 125 ) consist one follow-up visit . Participants randomize discontinue adalimumab therapy reinstituted adalimumab DAS28-score increase &gt; 1.2 unit baseline and/or score ≥2.6 visit study follow additional 12 week .</detailed_description>
