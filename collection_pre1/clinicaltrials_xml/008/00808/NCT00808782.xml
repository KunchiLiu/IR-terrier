	<brief_title>The Use rTMS Improve Theory Mind Among Adults With Autism Asperger 's Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autism Asperger 's disorder life-long neurodevelopmental disorder involve significant social , communicative , behavioural abnormality . Social impairment arguably debilitate aspect disorder , persist adulthood , create difficulty various domain include employment , education , interpersonal relationship . This impairment also frequently associate additional mental health concern , include depression anxiety , former affect many 40 % individual autism ( Stewart , Barnard , Pearson , Hasan , &amp; O'Brien , 2006 ) . It suggest core deficit underlie social dysfunction autism Asperger 's disorder impairment `` theory mind '' ( ToM ) ( Baron- Cohen et al. , 2005 ) . An important aspect social cognition , ToM refers ability use environmental cue infer others ' mental state . It include recognition individual experience thought , feeling , intention , desire may different . ToM crucial social functioning , allow u predict others behaviour gain appreciation perspective , thereby facilitate effective social interaction . ToM assess use array behavioural task . Such task typically illustrate social scenario , aim task identify various aspect character 's mental state . Increasingly , researcher distinguish cognitive ToM , encompass inference another individual 's belief , knowledge memory , affective ToM , concern predict others ' emotional state ( Shamay-Tsoory &amp; Aharon-Peretz , 2007 ) . Cognitive ToM measure include false-belief task , successful completion require understand another individual hold mistake belief ( first-order false-belief ) , therefore different belief , another individual hold mistaken belief mental state third person ( second-order false-belief ; Harrington , Siegert , &amp; McClure , 2005 ) . Another cognitive ToM task involve infer intention series short animation demonstrate interaction non-human object ( e.g. , geometric shape ; Castelli , Frith , Happe , &amp; Frith , 2002 ) . By contrast , affective ToM measure include `` eye task '' ( Baron- Cohen , Wheelwright , Hill , Raste , &amp; Plumb , 2001 ) , require inference another individual 's emotional experience presentation eye . The eye task consider ToM measure involve inference another individual 's mental state environmental stimulus , unlike false-belief task central affective component . An additional ToM test think involve cognitive affective aspect ToM faux pas test ( Stone , Baron- Cohen , &amp; Knight , 1998 ) , assess ability recognize faux pa within context series vignette describe social interaction . This ability require understanding mental state two people : individual unwittingly commit faux pa ( cognitive ToM ) , individual might offend insulted faux pa ( affective ToM ) . Thus , ToM task concerned inference others mental state , whereas cognitive ToM task require inference concern others beliefs , affective ToM task require inference concern others emotion . The brain basis ToM increasingly well establish ; recent fMRI study utilize cognitive ToM task indicate widespread frontotemporal activity . This include temporal pole bilaterally right superior temporal sulcus ( STS ) , seem reflect role memory visual perception respectively ( Gallagher &amp; Frith , 2003 ; Schultz &amp; Robins , 2005 ) . It activation within bilateral medial prefrontal cortex , however , think reflect unique contribution ToM . Gallagher Frith ( Gallagher &amp; Frith , 2003 ) suggest distinct area within medial prefrontal cortex , bilateral anterior paracingulate cortex ( x = 8 , = 54 , z = 1 ) , crucial region ToM ability . While medial prefrontal cortex strongly implicate cognitive ToM , neural network recruit affective ToM somewhat different ( despite substantial overlap ) , involve amygdala , orbitofrontal cortex , ventromedial frontal lobes addition temporal region . A recent lesion study ToM support neuroanatomical dissociation cognitive affective ToM ( Shamay-Tsoory &amp; Aharon-Peretz , 2007 ) . There substantial evidence impair ToM autism Asperger 's disorder . Individuals disorder consistently demonstrate delayed impair performance cognitive affective ToM task ( Baron-Cohen , Jolliffe , Mortimore , &amp; Roberstson , 1997 ; Baron-Cohen , Leslie , &amp; Frith , 1985 ; Kaland , Smith , &amp; Mortensen , 2007 ; Rogers , Dziobek , Hassenstab , Wolf , &amp; Convit , 2007 ) . Indeed , suggest ToM impairment core deficit autism , underlies characteristic social communicative symptom ( Baron-Cohen et al. , 1985 ; Tager-Flusberg , 2001 ) . Imaging study among individual autism demonstrate reduce activity medial prefrontal cortex , particularly cognitive ToM task ( e.g. , Castelli et al. , 2002 ) . Justification project Social dysfunction , include impaired ToM , arguably debilitate aspect autism associate disorder . There currently treatment option target social deficit autism Asperger 's disorder . An increase prevalence autism spectrum disorder ( Chakrabarti &amp; Fombonne , 2005 ) ensure next decade see unprecedented number adult case ; therefore imperative develop effective therapeutic technique reduce impact core autistic symptom . Functional imaging data review suggest bilateral medial prefrontal cortex promise site neurobiological intervention group improve ToM ( particularly cognitive ToM ) broader social functioning . We suggest repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) may effective therapeutic technique enhance medial prefrontal cortex activity improve ToM individual autism , anticipated benefit social aspect disorder . rTMS safe non-invasive technique involve repeat administration localize magnetic pulse distinct cortical region . When applied high-frequencies , rTMS enhances cortical activity site stimulation . This particularly useful clinical setting , rTMS administer cortical region functional imaging suggest underactive particular psychiatric disorder ( e.g. , leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [ DLPFC ] depression ) , approach effective alleviate core symptom disorder . Conversely , low-frequency rTMS decrease cortical activity site stimulation . Hypothesis/research question It hypothesize two week high-frequency rTMS medial prefrontal cortex , expect increase cortical activity within region , significantly improve ToM performance ( particularly cognitive ToM ) among individual autism Asperger 's disorder . Improvements social function expect see one month last treatment session . Methodology include project design sequence procedures This project involve administration rTMS via `` deep TMS ' '' H-system coil ( Brainsway Inc. , Jerusalem , Israel ) . This administer modified TMS coil , use exist stimulator equipment ( Magstim ) , use previous rTMS study . This H-system coil allow deep penetration TMS pulse , ensure accurately stimulate part medial prefrontal cortex relevant ToM . Safety efficacy study deep TMS indicate equivalence conventional TMS ( figure-of-eight ) coil ( Levkovitz et al. , press ; Zangen , Roth , Voller , &amp; Hallett , 2005 ) . This study rTMS trial improve ToM social function among adult autism Asperger 's disorder . Adults diagnose either autism Asperger 's disorder randomize ( via computer generate number sequence ) either active rTMS sham condition , strict double-blind condition . Based prior image data , rTMS administer bilateral medial prefrontal cortex . This study involve deep TMS via use H-system coil . Prior rTMS session participant undergo high-resolution ( 3T ) structural functional MRI . The fMRI component include cognitive affective ToM measure . Using reliable neuronavigational method , individual 's brain scan use determine site scalp lie cortical region interest ( bilateral medial prefrontal cortex ) , therefore target rTMS . Prior first rTMS session , participant complete battery neurobehavioural test assess theory mind ( e.g. , false-belief task , eyes test , faux pas test ) . In order gauge whether impact broad realm social functioning autism , participant also administer `` Autism Spectrum Quotient '' ( AQ ; Baron-Cohen , Wheelwright , Skinner , Martin , &amp; Clubley , 2001 ) , fifty item self-report measure . At begin first rTMS session , determine rest motor threshold ( RMT ) administer TMS leave motor cortex , record ( via EMG ) response right thumb muscle . RMT define low intensity 3 5 consecutive TMS pulse result EMG response great 50 µV . Using deep TMS coil , participant receive 15 minute either active sham rTMS ( 5 Hz ) consecutive weekday two-week period . During session , 10 second 5Hz rTMS , follow 20 second rest . Thus , session 30 10 train 5Hz rTMS administer . After final rTMS treatment , three ToM measure AQ readministered . These measure administer one-month final rTMS treatment . The researcher administer measure blind participant 's treatment ( i.e. , active shame ) . After completion one-month follow-up , participant unblinded study condition . Those allocated sham condition give opportunity complete two week active rTMS treatment . Statistical analysis sample size calculation As effect rTMS ToM investigate , somewhat difficult conduct power analysis . However , base sample size previous rTMS study involve modulation cognitive ability ( e.g. , Giovannelli et al. , 2006 ; Kwan et al. , 2007 ; Tunik , Frey , &amp; Grafton , 2005 ) treatment psychiatric disorder ( e.g. , Fitzgerald et al. , 2006 ; Horacek et al. , 2007 ) , confident sample size sufficient detect significant result . ANOVA use investigate effect rTMS medial prefrontal cortex ToM . Outcome variable include ToM measure , also autism-relevant rating scale determine social functioning associate aspect . Thus , conduct repeat measure ANOVA measure ( pre , post , one-month post rTMS ) , group ( active vs. sham ) include between-subjects variable .</detailed_description>
