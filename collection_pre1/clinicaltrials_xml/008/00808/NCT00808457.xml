	<brief_summary>The study large number patient ( least 200 patient ) several European centre aim investigate value chest ultrasound diagnose check course pneumonia compare chest X-ray film two plane - case controversial X-ray finding- compare low-dose CT. An X-ray finding regard controversial , infiltrate reliably exclude reliably represent definite diagnosis , thus , possible . A low-dose CT indicate even case positive chest ultrasound negative X-ray finding . Sonographic record characterization pneumonic infiltrates perform time diagnose course therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary target criterion • Assessing sensitivity chest ultrasound diagnose pneumonia . Secondary target criterion comprise - Assessing specificity , negative positive predictive value chest ultrasound time diagnosing , - Characterizing pneumonic infiltrates time diagnose course , - Describing association clinical , X-ray sonographic finding course pneumonia . The tertiary target criterion include • Characterizing range pathogen detect microbiological examination .</detailed_description>
