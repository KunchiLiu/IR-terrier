	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients screen request copy follow material time contact program : 1 . An indication ethnic background potential participant , may unknown . 2 . Photographs potential participant give indication skin complexion/pigmentation undyed hair color ( available ) . 3 . Ophthalmology visual specialist record document visual exam characteristic , potentially include iris transillumination , visual evoke potential characteristic eye finding ( available ) . 4 . Genetic test result ( available ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion study make base one follow criterion : 1 . Significant evidence potential participant either OCA1A OCA2 typical presentation , AND ethnic background wellrepresented current study ( proportion study exceed proportion United States population ) . The rationale exclusion : 1 ) biologicaland clinicalresearch perspective , adequate number OCA1A/ OCA2 case current study population ; 2 ) , despite , person ethnicity underrepresented study may inform understand populationlevel molecular pattern OCA1A/ OCA2 cultural implication albinism . 2 . Persons 1 year age . This exclusion occur urgency early evaluation . Also , Clinical Center staff resource suit care older child . 3 . Persons sick travel safely NIH Clinical Center . 4 .
