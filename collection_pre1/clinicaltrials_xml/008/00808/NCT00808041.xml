	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Monitoring With Breast Computed Tomography ( CT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Before undergoing surgery remove tumor , common breast cancer patient first undergo chemotherapy hormonal therapy . The main goal therapy reduce size tumor remove . Unfortunately , therapy response varies lot patient . The development effective therapy response monitoring method could reduce time patient undergoes ineffectual therapy unnecessary therapy complete response . Dedicated breast compute tomography ( breast CT ) , new way image breast , introduce last year . Breast CT x-ray exam use 3D imaging show breast real three dimensional shape . Combined use special chemical call iodine contrast enhancement , breast CT provide image anatomy blood flow breast . We propose use breast CT carefully monitor response therapy breast cancer patient undergo therapy surgery .</detailed_description>
