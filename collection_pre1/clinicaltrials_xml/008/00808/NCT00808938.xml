	<brief_summary>Electro convulsive therapy ( ECT ) remain establish therapy large percentage patient depression fail respond standard treatment . It commonly use substantial problem include occurrence cognitive side effect often highly distress patient . The development new treatment similar efficacy minimises side effect would great clinical value . One highly promising possibility magnetic seizure therapy ( MST ) . MST involve replace electrical stimulation use ECT magnetic stimulus . This appear able produce similar clinical effect without disable cognitive side effect related ECT . However , substantive trial use new MST equipment require . Due rarity equipment available far , undertaken handful place internationally research MST occur Australia . The investigator fortunate able obtain one limited number MST device available internationally propose pilot study technique . Conduct successful pilot study would strong justification application large head-to-head MST - ECT comparison trial . Should MST show similar efficacy ECT reduce side-effects , envision could rapidly replace ECT clinical practice throughout Australia indeed internationally substantial ongoing benefit patient . These would include enhanced use outpatient therapy well reduction side-effects . The study open label trial MST 15 patient treatment resistant depression refer ECT . All patient undergo dose titration procedure establish seizure threshold , six MST treatment session provide 120 % threshold . If patient achieve 50 % reduction depressive symptom ( measure Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale rating scale ) patient receive another 12 session . MST administer three time week . Patients undergo series assessment determine efficacy MST cognitive outcome . The primary outcome measure MADRS measure depression severity . The investigator additionally measure patient rat depression severity cognitive function The overall aim current project , via open label pilot trial , investigate clinical response magnetic seizure therapy patient treatment resistant depression refer electroconvulsive therapy .</brief_summary>
