	<brief_summary>At Tata Memorial Hospital 50 % patient present locally advanced stage technically unresectable , beyond realm potentially curative surgical resection . The evaluation treatment approach tumor hamper absence substantial randomized study heterogeneous nature tumor presentation . The management tumor change year , emphasis neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy , try convert tumor initially unresectable one potentially curable surgery . But 70-80 % patient able complete treatment without significant treatment break . Dose escalate treatment radiotherapy locally advance unresectable rectal cancer try many small series good result lesser toxicity . Comparison outcome two arm indicate relative efficacy toxicity neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiation v boost radiotherapy alone downstaging advanced cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concurrent Chemo-Radiotherapy Versus Radiotherapy With Boost Locally Advanced Unresectable Rectal Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims/ Objectives 1 . To compare resectability rate patient treat conventional chemoradiation patient treated radiation alone additional boost primary tumor case unresectable rectal cancer . 2 . To study treatment toxicity local control rate . Study methodology This phase II Randomised control study . Ninety case advance rectal cancer ( Stage II - Stage III ) divide two equal group ( Arm I &amp; II ) Arm-1 ( standard arm ) - Patients receive standard external radiation therapy pelvis + concurrent chemotherapy Tab Capecitabine . This follow surgery 6-8 week deem resectable . Arm-2 ( research arm ) Patients group receive neo-adjuvant chemotherapy , instead receive radiotherapy alone additional dose localize radiotherapy boost . This follow surgery 6-8 week deem resectable .</detailed_description>
