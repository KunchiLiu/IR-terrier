	<brief_summary>Lung combine heart-lung transplantation represent establish treatment strategy patient end-stage lung disease . Transplantation result increase exercise capacity , good quality life - depend pulmonary disease - prolonged life compare natural course pulmonary disease . However , even successful organ transplantation , patient realise often inflate , unrealistic character previous expectation due continue dependence medication , regular control examinations high risk infection allograft rejection . Patients cope erupt demand family , social work life . It become evident life change forever . In context , limitation mental health like depression reduce quality life ( QoL ) well diminish compliance may emerge even persist . By five year post-transplant , one-half patient meet criterion anxiety disorder . Symptoms clinically relevant depression mood disorder occur 10 15 % lung transplant patient . In addition , patient lung transplantation often poor physical condition hold reduce functional status . Surgery , prolong weaning period mechanical ventilation , sepsis , especially immunosuppressive medication may long-ranging permanently limit physical activity , reduce muscle mass bodily function . Some positive effect either psychological coping skill train supervised exercise therapy lung heart-lung transplantation QoL functional status describe exist pilot study small number patient short-term follow-up . In addition , although clear evidence point mutual amplify effect psychological training exercise therapy patient cop chronic disease , study yet conduct transplantation field . Therefore , aim investigator randomise control study prove differential benefit multi-modal resource-activating behavioural training programme combine intensified exercise training programme functional status well QoL four-armed design . The investigator hypothesis : ( H1 ) The multimodal resource-activating behavioural training programme show good out-comes measure global health-related QoL compare relaxation group . ( H2 ) Participants intensify anaerobic exercise training well outcomes measure exercise-related variable lung function group moderate aerobic exercise training . ( H3 ) Participants behavioural intervention programme intensify exercise training well outcomes measure global health-related QoL exercise-related variable compare group .</brief_summary>
