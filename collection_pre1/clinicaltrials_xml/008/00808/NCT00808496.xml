	<brief_summary>Inflammatory arthritis major cause permanent joint damage . Joint damage cause functional disability physical deformity . Many inflammatory arthritis patient develop permanent joint damage within first two year disease . Early , aggressive treatment drug call disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) know reduce quickly damage occurs . Sometimes , however , even patient ' symptom control , disease continue cause joint damage . This study determine magnetic resonance imaging ( also know 'MRI ' ) conduct every six month provide arthritis specialist information help good treat peripheral inflammatory arthritis patient first two year care . The effect MRI compare 1 ) use x-ray every six month ; , 2 ) frequency test usually use . The study also determine difference treatment three group result difference well-being patient . A total 186 patient early sign inflammatory arthritis study . All participant MRI x-ray conduct every six month . One-third participant ( 62 total ) MRI information send arthritis specialist ( MRI group ) ; 62 x-ray information sent ( X-ray group ) ; , remain 62 x-ray information send order arthritis specialist ( Usual Care group ) . Negative disease progression report send arthritis specialist unless intervention allocation-specific disease progression detect . In case , report blind imaging modality send indicate detection disease progression relative last timepoint progression , baseline , applicable . At point study , arthritis specialist request clinical MRI x-ray participant . Neither participant doctor know group assign . A computer program randomly assign participant one three group use technique call minimization . This technique account difference participant know effect disease progression treatment decision . Using technique , participant similar disease evenly distribute three group . The result study direct impact care new inflammatory arthritis patient . It determine benefit , , regular monitoring disease progression MRI x-ray . Using test proven help treatment decision-making , arthritis specialist improve care provide new inflammatory arthritis patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose project double-blinded randomized-controlled trial determine biannual monitoring inflammatory arthritis disease progression 1.0T peripheral magnetic resonance imaging ( pMRI ) 2nd 5th metacarpophalangeal joint worst-effected dominant hand baseline compare conventional radiography hand wrist , standard care , alters frequency pharmacological treatment escalation two year . A sample size 186 ( 62 per group ) require determine mean difference rate pharmacological treatment escalation three group 90 % power 5 % level significance , assume 5 % spontaneous remission rate , 15 % miss data , 5 % annual attrition .</detailed_description>
