	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : Among patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) require hemodialysis , maintenance adequate vascular access critical importance . As overall population U.S. age , every year great number patient maintain hemodialysis estimate Medicare expenditure excess 1.25 billion dollar per year.1 The complication related dialysis access major determinant patient outcome , include morbidity mortality , 16-25 % hospital admission dialysis patient U.S. related dialysis access complication estimate cost 100 million dollars.2 For patient ESRD require chronic hemodialysis , autogenous Brescia-Cimino fistula consensus best choice creation AV access site hemodialysis . This type primary fistula use radial artery wrist suitable cephalic vein level wrist . The fistula typically mature 6-8 week vein artery normal , provide good flow rate minimal incidence ischemia hand . Infection rate extremely low long term patency excellent . The disadvantage low maturation rate vein segment fibrosis previous IV sit venipuncture common cephalic vein wrist . Difficulty fistula maturation lead prolong time tunneled dialysis catheter ( TDC ) patient undergoes variety procedure correct fistula allow mature . Up 40 % forearm primary Brescia-Cimino fistula either fail mature occlude prior use , incidence failure forearm fistula significantly high woman compare men . Infection rate tunnel dialysis catheter roughly 10 time fistulas graft ; therefore , month even year TDCs , fistulas mature , consequence . Infections estimate account 14 % death ESRD patients.3 In absence suitable cephalic vein wrist case poor maturation , two main option exist . They acceptable clinical practice chosen base particular clinical scenario , extent , surgeon preference . The option include : 1. ePTFE ( polytetrafluoroethylene ) bridge AV graft typically anastomose proximal forearm radial brachial artery antecubital vein . The advantage include quick maturation 2-3 week , excellent flow rate high technical success rate . Although secondary patency rate approach 80 % one year postoperatively , disadvantage include involved surgical procedure , low primary patency well function AV fistula , high revision infection rates.4 , 5 2 . Performing autogenous AV fistula include various option brachiocephalic AV fistula , basilic brachial vein transposition variety strategy maintain primary access . The advantage would maintain autogenous venous access less risk infection thrombosis . Some procedure , however , may involve extensive dissection , long time maturation , result fistula difficult use even function well . Several procedure also perform occasion aid maturation AV fistula actually available access . In addition , `` steal '' phenomenon common proximal fistula flow rate excessively high low central resistance large vein , lead decrease blood flow hand . All factor often translate prolonged central venous catheter placement ( TDC ) dialysis , associate high incidence infection central vein stenosis , thrombosis.6 Because superior patency primary fistula , Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( K/DOQI ) Fistula First initiative articulate advantage fistulas vs. ePTFE bridge graft long-term dialysis access recommend least 50 % patient region dialysis primary fistula.7 In addition , 2006 K/DOQI set target 66 % prevalent fistulas 2009.8 Many surgeon also adopt 100 % autogenous policy recommendation without critical assessment potential downside policy.9 Others continue use ePTFE preferentially cephalic vein available . Although doubt suitable patient primary fistula well prosthetic graft , data guide best treatment strategy absence suitable forearm cephalic vein . Although K/DOQI encourage creation primary fistula , multiple procedure require fistula maturation prolong time tunneled dialysis catheter , complication may outweigh complication ePTFE grafts.10</detailed_description>
