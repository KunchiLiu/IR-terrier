	<brief_summary>The purpose study demonstrate safety feasibility early intranasal cool prior return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) emergency medical service ( EMS ) environment . It hypothesize cool resuscitation attempt would increase ROSC subsequent survival . The study power demonstrate statistically-significant difference outcome parameter , intend exploratory study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-ROSC Intra-Nasal Cooling Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Out hospital cardiac arrest remain significant cause death . Mild hypothermia induce resuscitation cardiac arrest show improve neurologically intact survival . Studies dogs rodent demonstrate improved outcome cool initiated intra-arrest . The RhinoChill non-invasive cooling device rapid cool achieve via intranasal delivery evaporative coolant nasopharynx . Due non-invasive portable nature , RhinoChill use begin cool earlier cool device . Studies perform use RhinoChill porcine model cardiac arrest suggest cooling RhinoChill prior first defibrillation attempt facilitate resuscitation improve resuscitation rate neurologically intact survival . This study perform assess feasibility use RhinoChill device pre-hospital setting improve resuscitation cardiac arrest .</detailed_description>
