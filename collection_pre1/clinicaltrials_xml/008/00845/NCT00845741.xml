	<brief_title>Neutrophil Gelatinase-associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) Evaluation Emergency Department ( ED ) All-Comers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center prospective pilot clinical study assess utility Triage neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) Test aid early risk assessment development acute kidney injury ( AKI ) ( sub clinical minimal change creatinine level complete failure result kidney replacement therapy ) all-comers population patient present Emergency Department ( ED ) designate hospital admission.. The secondary objective assess utility Triage NGAL Test aid assessment AKI severity patient present ED , determine combination Triage NGAL measurement clinical judgment improve early risk assessment development AKI correlate Triage NGAL level patient outcomes . Approximately 700 adult present ED designate admission hospital enrol . The treat physician note preliminary ED diagnosis AKI vs. AKI ( include prerenal azotemia , non-progressive chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) preserve renal function ) level confidence diagnosis percentage follow initial exam . EDTA anti-coagulated blood sample ( Triage NGAL Test ) blood sample process serum ( Cystatin C test ) collect measured NGAL Cystatin C level subject following time point : - immediately upon decision admit hospital ED [ baseline ] , - 6 12 hour baseline draw - day 1 , 2 3 follow admission hospital , - day hospital discharge ( subject hospitalize beyond day 3 ) The result NGAL Cystatin C assessment blind medical team study impact medical management subject . Blood sample unblinded standard care assessment serum creatinine ( analyzed hospital 's laboratory ) also obtain : - ED [ baseline ] , - day 1 , 2 3 follow admission hospital , - day hospital discharge ( subject hospitalize beyond day 3 ) Additional study specific blood sample blind assessment serum creatinine ( analyzed hospital 's laboratory ) also obtain : • 6 12 hour baseline draw</detailed_description>
