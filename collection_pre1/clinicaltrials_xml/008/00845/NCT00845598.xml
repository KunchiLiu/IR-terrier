	<brief_title>Azelastine Fluticasone Combination vs. Fluticasone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergic rhinitis ( AR ) major chronic respiratory disease prevalence approach nearly 25 % worldwide population.Allergic Rhinitis common relatively undiagnosed public health problem report one ten common cause outpatient attendance general practitioner . Long term untreated allergic rhinitis may lead asthma . When expose allergen ( pollen , house dust mite etc ) atmosphere , mast cell nose burst inflammatory response trigger patient experience sneezing , itching , block nose running . These allergen may use provocation agent recreate disease symptom confirm diagnosis allergens one allergic . However , risk allergic reaction . Adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) achieve goal stimulate mast cell cause burst without actually risk allergen provocation test . Such test commonplace research clinical medicine . Nasal steroid consider potent medication allergic rhinitis , particularly nasal blockage . Nasal antihistamine also available act mainly limit nasal running , itch sneeze less effect blockage . The advantage act quickly steroid take least 72 hour begin act week achieve maximal benefit . Finally , free significant short long term side effect . Having say nasal steroid safe unlike inhaled oral steroid show cause systemic side effect adult . Therefore , interest see combination antihistamine nasal steroid would add good quality mention act reduce dose steroid reduce side effect . To use nasal AMP challenge outcome measure do research study decade . We look noninvasive nasal airflow parameter , nasal nitric oxide level , safety look overnight urinary cortisol creatinine ratio sensitive noninvasive test urine quantify much steroid absorb blood stream .</detailed_description>
