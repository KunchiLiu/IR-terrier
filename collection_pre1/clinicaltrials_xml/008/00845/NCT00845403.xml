HBV vertical transmission hypothesize cause immune tolerance HBV thus promote subsequent HBV chronicity . Such hypothesis never test nothing know HBV-specific adaptive immune response occur birth baby bear form HBV chronically infect mother . This study aim gain understanding key component immune response hepatitis B present cord blood HBV infect mother . The characterization HBV immune response utero provide information cause HBV chronicity Asian patient management baby bear HBsAg+ mother .</detailed_description>
