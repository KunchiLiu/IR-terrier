	<brief_title>Ovine Graft ( Omniflow II ) Versus PTFE Below Knee Arterial Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Despite advance endovascular therapy , arterial bypass restore blood flow patent distal artery often best option management low extremity occlusive arterial disease . The great saphenous vein conduit choice infrainguinal reconstruction - always available otherwise unusable significant percentage patient . In situation , arterial reconstruction use prosthetic material option . Synthetic biological vascular graft use three decade . With time , synthetic conduit tend increase thrombogenic potential rather diminish formation neointima . Over time biological graft become alternative synthetic material , mainly demand application knee . For various reason biological graft withdraw market Omniflow II ( Bio Nova International , Mel-bourne , Australia ) currently biological vascular prosthesis available peripheral revascularisation . Objective The Omniflow II prosthesis biosynthetic device form stabilised sheep collagen integral polyester mesh . It produce insert polyester mesh-covered mandrel beneath cutaneous trunci muscle adult sheep period 12-14 week . The collagen-encapsulated tube harvest stabilised use glutaraldehyde . The design provide long-term structural stability prosthesis compliance similar autologous artery . There randomised study compare Omniflow II graft either autologous vein PTFE . Extensive vivo test perform safety efficacy . The Omniflow graft register Europe , Australia , Canada range country South America South East Asia . Methods All patient age 20 90 peripheral arterial disease severe , life-style limit claudication , rest pain tissue lesion base occlusion femoral popliteal artery consider , suitable vein available reconstruction infrapopliteal reconstruction . Written consent obtain volunteer patient include willingness participate follow-up process . Primary end point study primary patency , define duplex scan freedom binary restenosis 50 % .</detailed_description>
