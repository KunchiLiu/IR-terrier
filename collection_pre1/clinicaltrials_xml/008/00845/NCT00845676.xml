	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection one important cause illness death among people live HIV/AIDS . Over 200,000 people Unites States , include 37,000 California , co-infected HIV HCV . In past , people HIV HCV often die AIDS HCV could cause serious problem . However , improvement HIV/AIDS care treatment , co-infected people live longer thus develop complication HCV , include liver scarring ( call cirrhosis ) death . HCV infection also make HIV medication toxic liver , limit HIV treatment option . Treatment chronic ( long-term ) HCV infection improve recent year , people HIV still half likely clear chronic HCV infection treatment HIV-negative individual . Also , HCV treatment toxic may serious side effect patient , particularly HIV . Recent research suggest treatment start within first month get HCV infection ( call `` acute infection '' ) result high treatment response rate people HIV . It know whether similarly high treatment response rate also see people HIV . It also show individual 's response early phase HCV treatment predict ability clear HCV infection end treatment . This study look whether possible follow person 's HCV viral load time measure treatment success tailor individual 's treatment response . This idea call `` kinetically guided therapy '' new way individualize treatment regimen produce high treatment success rate minimize amount potentially toxic medication individual might need . In pilot study , 20 HIV-infected individual acute HCV infection treat HCV therapy 24 week . Because HIV co-infection decrease treatment success chronic HCV infection , treatment start strong combination pegylated-interferon plus ribavirin . However , protocol monitor individual 's HCV viral load first 12 week treatment stop ribavirin week 12 individual good early response might need continue medication . Using approach , pegylated interferon give full 24 week treatment , ribavirin continue either 12 24 week , depend individual 's early response therapy . The primary endpoint study percentage people sustain virologic response study treatment . The side effect treatment also measure order determine overall risk benefit approach treatment .</detailed_description>
