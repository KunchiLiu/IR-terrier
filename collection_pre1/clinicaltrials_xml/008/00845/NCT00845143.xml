	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess correlation predict post-operative lung function observe post-operative lung function ( FEV1 DLCO ) patient underwent surgical resection ( FEV1 = Forced expiratory volume 1-second . DLCO = Diffusion capacity carbon monoxide . ppo = predict postoperative . ) versus gold standard QRRVP ( Quantitative Radionuclide Study Regional Lung Ventilation Perfusion )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current standard lung function test use radioisotope ( material produce radiation ) inject vein breathe lung , show image function lung . The VRI system use pressure sensor act like electronic stethoscope ( tool use doctor listen heart sound body ) . These sensor record energy ( vibration ) create airflow lung breathe process , visually image . Before start study , screen evaluation . The study doctor review medical record find eligible take part study . Information view include whether skin lesion might interfere sensor placement , whether cardiac pacemaker , and/or pregnancy test result . The study doctor review type information view medical record find eligible take part study . For woman able child , negative pregnancy test result medical record , able take part study . If find eligible agree take part study , lung function test VRI system immediately standard lung function test . To perform VRI test , ask remove shirt put garment cover front body . You also ask remove jewelry body accessory . You ask sit backless chair , instructed sit proper posture breathe correctly test . Before record start , sensor clean place back . You instruct breathe deeply 12 second ( 2-3 time ) , vibration response record . You total 3 recording session , one . Once record do , sensor remove . The VRI image vibration examine operator order check quality image . The signal record sensor transfer computer researcher study image . The result recording compare standard lung function test result . This help researcher learn level accuracy VRI system predict lung function surgery . You tell result VRI test result use diagnose medical condition , medical decision make base VRI result . The VRI system use investigational purpose study replace current diagnostic method . If undergo surgery , part standard care , also return clinic standard test check lung function 4-12 week 4-12 month surgery . Researchers compare pre-surgery test result ( standard test result VRI result ) result test surgery ( standard test ) learn level accuracy VRI system predict lung function surgery .</detailed_description>
