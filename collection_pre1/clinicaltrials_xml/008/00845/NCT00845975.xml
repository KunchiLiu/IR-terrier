	<brief_title>Study Low Level Laser Therapy Tinnitus Relief</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tinnitus perception sound , ring hissing , occur ear head absence external stimulus . About 40-50 million people United States report experience tinnitus ; 10-12 million seek medical help tinnitus , 2.5 million reporting tinnitus debilitate . As result distress nature tinnitus , often accompany anxiety , depression sleep difficulty . Tinnitus often cause sensorineural hearing loss due presbyacusis ( age ) noise damage . It believe tinnitus result spurious neuro-electrical signal produce diseased , degenerate damage cochlear hair cell interpret brain tinnitus . There presently cure tinnitus . Current management strategy include use external sound distract tinnitus , teach relaxation stress reduction technique , prescription medication help ease stress , anxiety , depression sleep difficulty . However , general , current tinnitus management technique minimally effective . It believe low level laser light therapy may offer simple , non-invasive mean relieve symptom tinnitus . In theory , low level laser light penetrates target tissue stimulate mitochondrion underlie cell produce energy production adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . In turn , enhance ATP fuel cellular energy enhances blood flow cochlear hair cell ( cilium ) assist regulate electrical signal disrupt diseased and/or degenerate cochlear hair cell . With tame spurious electrical signal , brain long basis perceive noise know tinnitus .</detailed_description>
