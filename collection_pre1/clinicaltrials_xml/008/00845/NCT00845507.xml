	<brief_title>Exenatide Treatment Weight Gain Associated With Olanzapine Obese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Double-blind study suggest olanzapine highly effective treatment individual bipolar disorder . However , weight gain impaired glucose tolerance remain significant concern associate olanzapine . Exenatide anti-diabetic medication associate weight loss improve glucose regulation . Therefore , overall goal propose study conduct 16-week double-blind placebo-controlled study exenatide treatment weight gain associate olanzapine 60 obese adult bipolar disorder treat olanzapine . We propose conduct study course 24 month , expect enrollment approximately 3 patient per month . The primary outcome measure change baseline endpoint weight . The secondary outcome measure include change baseline endpoint , body mass index ( BMI ) , abdominal circumference , metabolic parameter , clinical global improvement psychiatric symptom , change manic , depressive psychotic symptom . Rates adverse event also assess .</detailed_description>
