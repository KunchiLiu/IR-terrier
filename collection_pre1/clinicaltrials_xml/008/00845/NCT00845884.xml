	<brief_summary>In spite multiple attempt improve efficacy first-line chemotherapy advance gastric cancer , progress achieve far rather limited , many investigator explore new regimens.A combination decetaxel ( Taxotere ) Cisplatin 5-fluorouracil ( 5FU ) consider one effective regimens disease . However , associate significant toxicity avoid general adaptation medical community . The current study explore new way administer three drug , hopefully make regimen comfortable , less toxic maybe even effective . We change dose timing Taxotere Cisplating , replace protract infusion 5FU tablet Capecitabine ( Xeloda ) add anti-angiogenic drug , Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) , show encouraging result disease .</brief_summary>
