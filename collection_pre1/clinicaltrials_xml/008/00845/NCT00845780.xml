	<brief_summary>Amiodarone consider effective antiarrhythmic drug prevention persistent atrial fibrillation . It however cause many adverse event , cardiac non-cardiac . Long-term maintenance sinus rhythm cardioversion difficult especially high recurrence rate first month cardioversion . Duration atrial fibrillation , type underlying disease , leave ventricular function , leave atrial size age associate maintain sinus rhythm . Early recurrence atrial fibrillation may relate highly arrhythmogenic period due recovery electrical remodelling . Late recurrence may relate trigger recovery electrical remodelling . In study investigator want investigate effect amiodarone withdrawal occurrence late relapse persistent atrial fibrillation . Furthermore , investigator want investigate effect amiodarone withdrawal occurrence amiodarone related adverse event well adverse event relate atrial fibrillation underlie heart disease . The investigator also want investigate patient characteristic potential trigger prognostic value occurence late relapse amiodarone withdrawal .</brief_summary>
