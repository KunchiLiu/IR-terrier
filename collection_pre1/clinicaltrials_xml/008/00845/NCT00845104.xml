	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fludarabine phosphate , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab bevacizumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving fludarabine phosphate together rituximab bevacizumab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give fludarabine phosphate together rituximab bevacizumab work treat patient B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia relapse responded treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludarabine Phosphate , Rituximab , Bevacizumab Treating Patients With B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia That Has Relapsed Not Responded To Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate PFS 2 year FR plus Avastin ( A ) induction follow Rituximab plus Avastin ( RA ) maintenance therapy relapsed/refractory CLL patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate FR-A induction RA maintenance therapy . II . To eliminate residual disease ( document flow cytometry and/or PCR ) patient achieve CR FR-A . III . To estimate rate conversion PR CR FR-A . IV . To determine safety pharmacokinetics FR-A RA maintenance . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV 20-30 minute daily day 1-5 rituximab IV daily day 4 5 . Treatment repeat every 35 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning day 8 course 1 , patient also receive bevacizumab IV 30 minute . Treatment repeat every 21 day 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response , partial response , nodular partial response proceed maintenance therapy . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning 2 month completion induction treatment , patient receive rituximab IV every 3 month bevacizumab IV 30 minute every 3 week . Treatment continue 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
