	<brief_title>Wayfinding Information Access System People With Vision Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The great mobility problem people severe visual impairment cause gap available information environment -- environmental cue need orient salient landmark surround environment wayfinding . Such informational cue great import person severe visual impairment become hopelessly lost keep track give moment move along . A newly develop long-range Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) tag reader might completely solve problem . Previously , passive ( i.e. , battery power ) RFID tag could read distance 16 inch less . This new tag reader read multiple tag 18 foot away , indicate direction range tag . At cost 10 , 250 RFID tag would place around environment equal cost 1 Braille sign ( $ 25 ) , yet value-added term available information distance incredible : every object ( landmark , door , water fountain , exit sign , chair , table , etc . ) within range 18 foot would able `` announce '' presence . Visible signage equivalency could achieve overnight . Further , Interface , Inc. , commercial floor manufacturer adhere RFID tag protect underside 50X50 cm floor tile . Using floor new long-range reader , elegant affordable indoor GPS-like guidance system realize triangulation RFID floor tile . In long run , RFID floor infrastructure fill , ideal solution could result , would enable development easily-managed building database contain everything user would need know orient new building find way around ease . Users would never lose , would always know current location heading . In addition , building database would much easy maintain , oppose update individual RFID tag , building tenant move renovation take place . Interface interested support research , donate 2500 square foot RFID floor VA purpose . The Research Questions answer herein propose research : 1 . How environmental information organize parse accord actual need person provide need information without inundate useless and/or distract information process ? 2 . How user interface structure offer need information easily control useable fashion ? To address Questions , follow Research Objectives establish : 1 . Determine kind information need accord ( ) characterization individual need , O &amp; M ability , degree useful residual vision ; 2 . Develop structured database information parse organize accord information associate specific participant characterization cluster associate individual need , residual vision , etc . ; 3 . Develop optimal user interface control delivery need information adaptable individual need participant ; 4 . Develop RFID reader antenna triangulate RFID tag floor determine user 's current location heading , well identify information location tag interest object surround ; 5 . Construct Evaluate Wayfinding Prototype specify result objective .</detailed_description>
