	<brief_summary>Patients inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) assess immunologic response pneumococcal vaccination . Patients IBD meet criterion outline Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) pneumococcal vaccination , yet investigator find pneumococcal vaccination population under-utilized . It unknown whether IBD IBD-related medication impact immune response recommend vaccine . Three group 25 patient recruit . The first group consist outpatient IBD receive infliximab ( Remicade TM ) concommitant immunosuppressive therapy ( either 6MP , azathioprine , methotrexate ) . This group intend represent common 'heavily immunosuppressed ' patient group IBD . The second group consist patient IBD see outpatient clinic immune-suppressive medication . These patient meet CDC criterion vaccination virtue chronic medical illness . The third group consist healthy age-matched ( first group ) control .
