Three cohort study sequentially : subject receive 120 mg , 240 mg 360 mg ETI-204 . The study randomize , double-blind , stratify gender . Each cohort contain 15 subject ( include least four female ) , twelve receive ETI-204 three receive placebo . Study Objectives : To determine safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics ETI-204 follow single intravenous administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Escalation Study With ETI-204</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Duration : Maximum 70 day subject ( enrollment end follow-up period ) , unless Day 70 HAHA ( human anti-humanized antibody ) positive , case subject follow HAHA test result negative . This represent total study duration , determine screening period enrollment rate . Description Agent : ETI-204 monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) protective antigen ( PA ) Bacillus anthracis . Schedule Evaluations : Blood pharmacokinetics ( antibody concentration ) : Predose follow time start infusion : 60 minute ( i.e. , completion infusion ) , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 48 hour Days 7 , 14 , 21 , 42 , 56 70 . Blood chemistry , hematology , urinalysis ( refer safety laboratory assessment schedule event ) , urine drug screen ( include ethanol cotinine visit ) : Screening , Day 0 , immediately pre-dose follow day start infusion : 7 , 14 , 21 , 42 . Urine pregnancy test female perform screening , baseline , immediately pre-dose 42 day . Tests coagulation viral serology test do screen . ECG : A 12-lead ECG do screening . In subject acceptable ECG parameter , continuous 24-h Holter monitoring . perform . After enrollment , standard 12-lead ECG recording perform study Day 1 ( predose , 1.5h , 2h , 4h , 8h 12h ±20 min ) continuous ECG telemetry monitor begin approximately 2 hour prior start infusion continue least 14 hour start infusion . ECG also record follow study Days : 2 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 42 . Measurement product specific human anti-humanized antibody ( HAHA ) : Pre-dose 42 day dose . HAHA positive subject Day 42 follow bi-weekly study Day 70 monthly HAHA test result negative . Vital sign ( BP , P , T , RR ) : Screening , Day 0 , follow time start infusion study day 1 : 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90±3 minute ; 2h,4h,8h , 12h 24h±10 minute ( Day 2 ) ; Days 7 , 14 , 21 42 . Screening Local Systemic Adverse Events : The infusion site proximal area inspect evidence erythema , edema , visible palpable cord , etc . study day 1 , 2 , 7 , 14 , 21 42 . Participating Sites : The Ohio State University Clinical Pharmacology Unit Columbus , Ohio</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Healthy male female subject age 1850 inclusive time enrollment . In drug cohort ( subgroup ) , least three subject must female . 2 .
