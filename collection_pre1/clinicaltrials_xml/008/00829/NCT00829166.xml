	<brief_summary>This Phase III , randomize , multicenter , international , 2-arm , open-label clinical trial design compare safety efficacy trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) capecitabine + lapatinib participant human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive locally advanced metastatic breast cancer . Participants treat disease progression ( PD ) , unmanageable toxicity , study termination . Once disease progression report , participant follow survival every 3 month death , loss follow-up , withdrawal consent , study termination .</brief_summary>
