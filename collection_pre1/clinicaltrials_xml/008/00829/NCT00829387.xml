	<detailed_description>Research Design : A randomized controlled design employ CBT plus standard pharmaceutical care ( CBT/SC ) compare educational intervention plus standard pharmaceutical care ( ED/SC ) treatment condition . A target sample size approximately 215 participant recruit . Participants randomize equal number two condition . Methodology : Study participant evaluate pre-treatment ( baseline ) , 12 week post-baseline ( post-treatment ) 36 week post-baseline ( follow-up ) . Baseline assessment include physical examination confirm diagnosis diabetic neuropathy . The primary outcome measure pain intensity . Secondary outcome measure pain quality , pain-related disability , physical emotional functioning . Measures treatment feasibility also examine . CBT ED provide 10 weekly , individual treatment session 60 minute . The effectiveness randomization process test examine potential condition difference important demographic pain-relevant descriptive variable , well dependent measure . Analyses covariance employ determine whether statistically significant difference two treatment condition observe 12- 36-week interval control pretreatment/baseline score measure covariates identify previously . Hypotheses Treatment outcome hypotheses - Persons DPNP receive cognitive behavioral therapy standard pharmaceutical care ( CBT/SC ) , relative receiving diabetic education standard pharmaceutical care ( ED/SC ) , demonstrate , immediately follow treatment improvement several measure experience persistent pain , include pain intensity , pain quality , pain-related disability , sleep quality , physical functioning , emotional functioning , few add pain medication dose concomitant pain treatment . - Persons DPNP receive CBT/SC , relative receiving ED/SC , demonstrate maintenance benefit 36-week post-baseline follow-up period . Treatment satisfaction feasibility hypotheses - Persons DPNP receive CBT/SC , relative receiving ED/SC , demonstrate , immediately follow treatment high rating treatment credibility treatment satisfaction , high rate treatment session attendance low rate treatment dropout . Exploratory secondary analysis predictor treatment participation outcome - Increased readiness adopt self-management approach positively associate high rating treatment credibility treatment satisfaction , high rate treatment session attendance low rate treatment dropout , participant CBT condition , high rate adherence therapist recommendation pain cop skill practice intersession goal . - Increased readiness adopt self-management approach course treatment associate improved outcome follow treatment . - Increased readiness adopt self-management approach treatment termination significantly predict maintenance treatment benefit follow-up . - Persons medical psychiatric comorbidities demonstrate , relative without comorbidities , less improved outcome , low rate treatment session attendance high rate treatment dropout , CBT condition , low rate adherence therapist recommendation pain cop skill practice intersession goal .</detailed_description>
