There increase evidence modafinil reduce fatigue healthy individual patient chronic , non-cancer condition . No good quality study publish evaluate modafinil patient cancer , despite multiple call research undertaken . The investigator complete small study determine feasibility undertaking large , high quality study assess effect modafinil fatigue patient lung cancer . Modafinil appear improve fatigue rapidly associate serious side-effects . Ten fifteen patient complete study chose continue modafinil long-term . However , study small definite conclusion drawn . This large , definitive study , fund National Cancer Research Institute research award , establish clearly whether modafinil improve fatigue patient lung cancer . Two hundred six patient recruit number site across UK . Half patient take modafinil , half take 'dummy ' tablet every day month . The fatigue level two group compare . Confirmation modafinil relieve cancer-related fatigue could highly significant impact quality life large number patient suffer common distress symptom .</brief_summary>
