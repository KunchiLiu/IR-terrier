	<brief_summary>People schedule surgery use Bone Morphogenic Protein ( call BMP-2 ) incisional vacuum assist closure device ( call IVAC ) ask join study . The purpose study see use IVAC device remove BMP-2 wound . BMP-2 protein use body increase bone healing , decrease need additional surgery , reduce infection rate . The IVAC device involve foam dress secure adhesive drape make airtight seal surgical incision . Tubing run foam dress device use gentle suction drain fluid ( like vacuum ) . The IVAC stay 48-72 hour depend amount drainage . The IVAC help reduce wound swell complication ( infection ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incisional Vacuum Assisted Closure ( IVAC ) Device Its Effect Implanted Bone Morphogenic Protein ( BMP-2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It hypothesize negative pressure associate IVAC sufficient remove BMP-2 surgical wound . BMP-2 commonly use open tibia fracture time definitive wound closure , wound prone increase swell wound complication . The recent observation IVAC decrease wound edema increase oxygenation lead use case . Used conjunction , entirely possible negative pressure exert IVAC remove BMP-2 surgical site therefore decrease effectiveness BMP-2 . We seek determine BMP-2 present effluent IVAC . If study hypothesis find wrong , BMP-2 find within IVAC effluent , prepare proceed follow-up study quantify BMP-2 removed IVAC .</detailed_description>
