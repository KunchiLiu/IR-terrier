	<detailed_description>A cleft palate may influence important function eat , function ear/hearing , speech , occlusion , addition social skill acceptability relate appearance . Surgical treatment aim minimize impact cleft function . Nevertheless often need orthodontic treatment , palate involve , speech therapy speech improve secondary surgery . The incidence otitis medium effusion , related hearing problem , high among child . The outcome affect type cleft well surgical method , although yet fully clarify . Some consider growth mid-face well primary surgery hard palate delay , speech development consider benefit primary palate surgery perform early possible . Yet donÂ´t know surgical method best . In part world three six treatment center Sweden palate close one stage 12 18 month age . At three Swedish center cleave soft palate close 4-6 month , cleave hard palate repair 2-3 year age . Video-recordings child 3 5 year age use evaluation . The speech material 3 year age consist spontaneous speech word naming . At 5 year sentence repetition re-telling task add . Blindly transcription material randomization , accord transcription use cleft palate speech Sweden base IPA ExtIPA convention perform . About 30 % material , randomly select , re-transcribed 30 % transcribe additional listener independently , calculation reliability . The result compare group regard articulatory deviancies phonological process , statistically analyze . Impact ear problem , hear speech therapy assess .</detailed_description>
