	<brief_summary>Dasatinib lenalidomide prescribe use patient different cancer blood . This study experimental neither drug approve Food Drug Administration treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia . There standard treatment fludarabine longer effective patient CLL . Some patient receive additional combination therapy fludarabine , Campath , bone marrow transplant supportive care . Dasatinib lenalidomide effective high-risk CLL patient pilot mono therapy study . The combination dasatinib lenalidomide study human study design test whether combination safe use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Using Two Oral Chemotherapy Agents Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CLL incurable disease current therapy . Modern chemoimmunotherapies , include combination rituximab purine nucleoside analogue ( fludarabine , cladribine , pentostatin ) , offer possibility improve survival , patient eventually relapse . Patients relapse refractory disease experience diminish benefit additional line therapy . In addition , patient high-risk CLL poor response even first-line therapy . Lenalidomide dasatinib non-overlapping proposed mechanism action . Single agent phase II study lenalidomide dasatinib demonstrate response heavily pretreated high-risk patient . For reason , propose treat patient relapse and/or refractory CLL purine nucleoside analogue therapy combination lenalidomide dasatinib .</detailed_description>
