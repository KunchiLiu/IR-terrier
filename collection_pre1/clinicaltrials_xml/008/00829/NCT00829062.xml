	<brief_title>Expanding Coverage Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion Pediatric Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) show aggressive intensive management diabetes lead reduction incidence diabetes related complication adolescent adult . Therefore , early initiation intensive insulin regimen prove normalize blood sugar much possible need initiate youth type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) improve outcomes adulthood . However , despite understanding , remain consensus best manage insulin delivery child diagnose T1DM . Intensive insulin treatment diabetes typically entails one two therapy : MDI ( multiple daily injection ) CSII also know insulin pump therapy . MDI require several insulin injection per day achieve near normal glycemic control also lead subsequent increase risk severe hypoglycemia . The insulin pump allow user program various basal insulin rate , low 0.025 units/hr , throughout day night well match one 's physiologic insulin secretion , eliminate need insulin injection throughout day . Management T1DM pediatric set present several challenge patient , caregiver , health care provider . Children adolescent tend wide fluctuation blood glucose level due vary amount physical activity day day . Additionally , infant , toddler , school age child eat habit unpredictable often eat small quantity make quite difficult accurately administer small dos insulin insulin syringe pen device . Finally , increase evidence support infant toddler experience severe hypoglycemia may resultant neurologic deficit . Previous research demonstrate pediatric patient insulin pump therapy well glycemic control compare pediatric patient manage MDI alone . Patients insulin pumps parent report flexibility meal daily activity , low hemoglobin A1c level , decrease variability blood sugar reading , few episode hypoglycemia . Despite vast research document benefit insulin pump therapy , insurance company continue hesitant cover CSII pediatric patient diabetes . The finding study support evidence present medical director Missouri Medicaid help expand coverage CSII pediatric patient diabetes .</detailed_description>
