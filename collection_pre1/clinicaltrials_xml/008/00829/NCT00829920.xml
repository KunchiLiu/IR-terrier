	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) observe patient muscle-invasive metastatic bladder cancer CTC become undetectable , least transiently , fraction patient treatment . To investigate hypothesis , investigator assess level CTCs treatment . The feasibility potential value fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) CTCs assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The measurement circulate tumor cell pursue several cancer include breast prostate cancer . The number cell measure cancer show prognostic . There little information presence importance circulate tumor cell bladder cancer . This trial design determine patient advanced bladder cancer circulate tumor cell circulate cell affected treatment cancer .</detailed_description>
