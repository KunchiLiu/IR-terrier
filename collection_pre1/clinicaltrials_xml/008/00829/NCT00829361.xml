	<detailed_description>Background : Acute stroke resource care deficient Arizona 's rural community . Stroke telemedicine proven modality overcome deficiency . Stroke telemedicine allow telephonic consultation and/or two-way audio video consultation stroke neurologist stroke patient remotely locate emergency department . University California San Diego Stroke Center complete NIH fund randomize controlled trial , STRokE DOC , compare telephonic consultation video consultation . In trial , video telemedicine consultation result accurate decision making compare telephone consultation .

Mayo Clinic Arizona currently complete state fund feasibility trial , STRokE DOC Arizona ( 06-005731 ) , preliminary step toward establish state wide stroke telemedicine network , STARR . The STARR network plan include prospective collection , record , regular analysis telestroke patient consultation data purpose quality measure assessment improvement . Objective : The objective research establish system prospective collection , record , regular analysis telestroke patient consultation care data purpose quality measure assessment improvement benchmarking national international telestroke program .

Mayo Clinic vascular neurologist , license privilege practice teleneurology speak hospital state , participate 24/7 Mayo Clinic telestroke hotline . When acute stroke patient present STARR network participate speak hospital emergency department , stroke alert activate hotline phone . An on-call vascular neurologist receives pager notification communicates refer emergency physician .

Emergency neurology care render . Every participate speak hospital emergency physician already sub-investigator telestroke research complete HSRP train certification . The Mayo Clinic IRB serve central IRB record state fund Mayo Clinic telestroke research . The patient legal designate approach either speak emergency physician investigator and/or hub neurologist investigator ( via telemedicine camera ) consent proceed telestroke consultation , acquire , store , analyze data concern acute stroke care outcome patient . Data source include Mayo Clinic electronic transcribe telestroke consultation note , emergency department nursing physician record , admission consultation diagnostic test record , hospital discharge note , content brief 90 day follow-up phone call research coordinator patient and/or family member . The licensed neurologist already authorization access patient speak hospital record part clinical privilege , designate Mayo Clinic research coordinator responsibility extract data source enter registry . The STARR registry data element exactly establish familiar data element STRokE DOC Arizona trial , purpose continuity . Mayo Clinic Arizona research biostatistics group develop electronic data manager conduct report analysis monthly telestroke research group .</detailed_description>
