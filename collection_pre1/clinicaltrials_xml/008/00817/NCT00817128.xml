	<brief_title>Pain Exposure Physical Therapy ( PEPT ) Versus CBO Patients With Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I ( CRPS-1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : PEPT expect 30 % effective around three-folds cheap usual therapy ( CBO ) Objective : The current Dutch CBO guideline treatment Complex Regional Pain Syndrome Type I ( CRPS-1 ) disappoint chronification , disability subsequent high medical cost personal suffering . A possible well treatment intensive function-oriented physical therapy Pain Exposure Physical Therapy ( PEPT ) . However , adequate study perform demonstrate efficacy PEPT therefore PEPT lack Dutch CBO CRPS-1 guideline . Despite lack scientific argumentation , PEPT approach Macedonian therapy , adopt large scale among physical therapist The Netherlands . There two level C retrospective cohort study demonstrate promise clinical relevant beneficial effect pain function PEPT . In response grow demand scientific argumentation among doctor physical therapist respect efficacy PEPT , conduct pilot study UMC St Radboud Nijmegen . The result pilot study promise therefore , decide design large RCT investigate treatment effect cost CRPS patient treat PEPT compare CRPS patient treat usual therapy accord Dutch CBO guideline . Study design : Prospective , single-blinded , randomized clinical trial . After base-line measurement ( T0 ) , measurement perform three ( T1 ) six month ( T2 ) inclusion . Follow-up nine month ( T3 ) . Study population : Patients Complex Regional pain Syndrome ( CRPS-1 ) either upper low extremity accord Bruehl's/IASP criterion ( see attachment ) 3 24 month initial injury select study . After information standard experimental treatment CRPS inform consent , patient enter study randomization usual ( CBO ) experimental ( PEPT ) treatment perform . Intervention : Treatment group : In treatment group medication prescribe CRPS taper zero . No invasive treatment like sympathetic block , and/or operation perform . After information mechanism action PEPT relation CRPS , patient receive five session PEPT include homework exercise . The basic PEPT function-oriented exercise therapy . The PEPT physical therapist manipulates restrict joint intensively train functional skill irrespective pain experience therapy . Patients stimulate use active cop style achieve clear functional goal 5 session . Control group : Usual treatment CRPS accord Dutch CBO CRPS guideline 2006 include , analgesic ( WHO pain ladder ) , neuropathic drug , N-acetylcysteine , calcium channel blocker , ketanserin DMSO ( dimethylsulphoxide ) . On indication , percutaneous sympathetic block spinal cord stimulation perform . In addition , patient receive physical therapy exercise within pain limit ( pain contingent ) , splint necessary , aid ADL activity . Outcome measure : Primary outcome measure Impairment level SumScore ( ISS ) , consist three measurement parameter ( pain , active range motion temperature ) four measurement instrument ( VAS , McGill Pain Questionnaire , goniometry mobility joint skin thermometer ) . A cost-effectiveness analysis societal perspective compare PEPT usual care patient CRPS perform . This do along-side clinical trial . Sample size calculation/data analysis : The sample size calculation base follow finding expectation . The improvement ISS ( primary outcome ) one year standard physical therapy group 50 % [ Oerlemans , APMR 2000 ] , PEPT group estimate minimal 70-80 % . Given alpha 0,05 power 80 % one side Chi-square test 31 patient need per group . The Student T- test use calculate difference group mean ISS .</detailed_description>
