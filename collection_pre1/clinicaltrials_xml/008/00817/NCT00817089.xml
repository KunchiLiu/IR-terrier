	<detailed_description>Despite well-established efficacy naltrexone , significant variation individual response naltrexone . A critical question remain : circumstance patient naltrexone beneficial ? Recent work center provide evidence mu-opioid receptor ( OPRM1 ) gene polymorphism A118G ( Asn40Asp ) impart significant change treatment response . We show patient Asn40 variant ( absence heavy drink -73.9 % v/s 49 % response ) . To consolidate knowledge , wish test relationship A118G polymorphism subjective/objective measure alcohol among alcoholic treat naltrexone . This work focus subject European Asian decent A118G polymorphism occur less 1 % African decent . Up 40 subject recruit . The study divide two phase . For first phase ( Phase I ) subject admit UPenn Translational Research Center receive two alcohol challenge session pretreatment naltrexone placebo .
