	<brief_summary>We want learn dasatinib make triple negative breast cancer small . We also hope learn make triple negative breast cancer grow . We believe information help u predict patient benefit take drug drug like . This study `` neoadjuvant study '' , mean open woman treatment breast cancer . Neoadjuvant study allow study doctor look cell cancer change take study medication . This help u understand whether dasatinib effective treatment breast cancer . It also help u learn triple negative breast cancer treat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Dasatinib Locally Advanced Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women recently diagnose type breast cancer call `` triple negative '' , yet receive type treatment ( surgery , radiation therapy , etc . ) breast cancer among patient population study seek . `` Triple negative '' mean breast cancer estrogen receptor positive ( ER+ ) , progesterone receptor positive ( PgR+ ) human epidermal growth factor receptor positive ( HER2+ ) . Some type breast cancer `` overexpress '' one receptor . `` Overexpress '' mean cancer cell many receptor . ER PgR hormone receptor locate type breast cancer cell . When receptor present , hormone estrogen progesterone able tell cancer cell grow divide . This kind breast cancer over-production ( overexpression ) three receptor , call `` triple-negative '' breast cancer . We try find new good treatment woman triple negative breast cancer . We know cause triple negative breast cancer grow . Other research study show `` triple negative '' breast cancer overexpress different type receptor . These receptor might help cancer grow . We test drug call dasatinib . Dasatinib drug make Bristol-Myers Squibb . It sell name Sprycel . It first use treat patient leukemia , type blood cancer . Dasatinib interfere growth cancer . Dasatinib attach cancer cell slow stop cancer cell grow . It approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , kind cancer diagnose .</detailed_description>
