	<brief_summary>This study preliminary study design determine safety effectiveness HFCWO use InCourage vest system airway clearance technique treatment CF . The study compare HFCWO commonly use airway clearance technique Canada , namely Positive Expiratory Pressure technique patient CF period one year . As preliminary study , able determine vest equivelant PEP , provide information need plan large study answer question .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Study , Comparing Vest Therapy Positive Expiratory Pressure ( PEP ) Therapy Treatment Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective This pilot study evaluate long-term clinical efficacy high frequency chest wall oscillation ( HFCWO ) use inCourage vest system , compare positive expiratory pressure mask ( PEP ) treatment patient cystic fibrosis . Study Design This one year prospective multi-centre randomize control trial HFCWO versus PEP airway clearance technique patient cystic fibrosis . Number respiratory exacerbation compare two treatment arm . Slope percent predict FEV1 , activity level , quality life , cost analysis subject satisfaction also compare . Number subject Enrollment complete 170 subject recruit , approximately 85 arm . Number sit The study involve 14 CF centre Canada . PERSCRIBED AIRWAY CLEARANCE TECHNIQUE The test airway clearance technique - High Frequency Chest Wall Oscillation use InCourage Vest System . This compare - The Positive Expiratory Pressure Mask Technique . Subjects randomize perform one techniques airway clearance technique period study . PRIMARY ENDPOINT Primary : Difference number respiratory exacerbation . ( For definition see Appendix A ) . Defined presence one major criterion 2 minor sign symptom . Major Criteria : - Decrease FEV1 ≥10 % best baseline within past 6 month , unresponsive ventolin . - Oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % room air ≥ 5 % decline previous baseline . - New find ( ) chest radiograph . - Hemoptysis ( streak one occasion past week ) . Minor Signs/symptoms : - Increased work breathe respiratory rate . - New increase adventitial sound lung exam . - Weight loss ≥ 5 % body weight decrease across one major percentile weight percentile age within past 6 month . - Increased cough . - Decreased exercise tolerance level activity . - Increased chest congestion change sputum . For minor signs/symptoms , duration symptom need ≥ 5 day significant symptom severity . SECONDARY ENDPOINTS Secondary : - The time first respiratory exacerbation measure group use definition respiratory exacerbation use primary outcome . - Change FEV1 measure difference yearly mean rate decline ( Appendix E ) . - Cost analysis two group . - Quality life questionnaire . - Patient satisfaction questionnaire . - Adherence treatment . DATA SAFETY MONITORING COMMITTEE The study monitor Data Safety Monitoring committee ( DSMC ) . The communicate regularly either teleconference , email face face meeting , deal issue arise . The review serious adverse event occur . The DSMC may request analysis time . At end randomize trial , report select final analysis provide DSMC . The study may terminate investigator , medical monitor , DSMC significant concern safety HFCWO base serious adverse event , safety data conduct trial . STATISTICS Primary Analysis : The number exacerbation treatment determine arm difference group calculate 95 % confidence limit measure precision .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female 6 year age old enrollment competent perform spirometry . Confirmed diagnosis CF . FEV1 &gt; 45 % predict calculated Wang reference equation Written inform consent ( assent applicable ) obtain subject subject 's legal representative ability subject comply requirement study . Clinically stable enrollment evidence respiratory exacerbation within month enrollment assess site CF Physician . Willingness adhere prescribe treatment regimen . Diagnosis Allergic BronchoPulmonary Aspergillosis , persistent culture B.cepacia complex within previous 1 year period .On active treatment non Tuberculous Mycobacterium . Use intravenous antibiotic within previous 14 day enrollment . Initiation change maintenance therapy within 14 day enrollment . Use systemic corticosteriods ( 1mg/kg &lt; 20 kg 20 mg prednisone per day ) within 14 day enrollment . Concurrent participation another study could potentially affect present study . Haemoptysis 20 ml 2 occasion within previous 30 day enrollment . A pneumothorax six month precede study . Presence condition abnormality opinion site CF Physician would compromise safety patient quality data .</criteria>
