	<brief_summary>Patients chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) high blood pressure general population . They also tend protein leak urine ( proteinuria ) . CKD , high blood pressure proteinuria independently together increase risk develop atherosclerosis ( harden ) artery lead disease heart attack stroke . Although number drug available low blood pressure , always fully effective . Furthermore , even few drug simultaneously low blood pressure , reduce proteinuria , slow kidney damage CKD . Recent research show drug like sitaxsentan low blood pressure also reduce proteinuria potentially slow progression CKD [ 1,2 ] . Before sitaxsentan become freely available individual CKD important look effect drug could proteinuria blood pressure . 1 . Goddard J , Johnston NR , Hand MF , et al .
