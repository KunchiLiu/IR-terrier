	<brief_title>Validation Stenosis Assessment Coronary Artery Computed Tomography Against Invasive Measurements Fractional Flow Reserve Patients With Significant Coronary Artery Stenoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Invasive X-ray coronary angiography remain `` reference standard '' evaluation coronary artery stenosis . Recently , coronary artery compute tomography angiography ( CorCTA ) introduce non-invasive method evaluation coronary artery stenoses show highly accurate stenosis detection compare invasive X-ray angiography . While invasive X-ray angiography CorCTA evaluate morphological feature coronary arterial plaque , fractional flow reserve invasive measure hemodynamic significance stenosis obtain catheterization laboratory measuring change intracoronary arterial pressure maximal vasodilation induce intracoronary adenosine . An FFR value le 0.75 show predict ischemia vascular bed distal stenosis radionuclide perfusion modality show associated bad outcome . Therefore , FFR consider invasive hemodynamic `` reference standard '' evaluation hemodynamic significance coronary arterial stenosis . While intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) provide additional morphological information intermediate stenosis , provide functional information use significant stenosis IVUS probe advance stenotic lesion . We currently conduct investigation validation CorCTA FFR intermediate coronary artery stenosis ( 40-70 % ) ( see `` Preliminary Data '' ) . However , CorCTA validate invasive hemodynamic measurement fractional flow reserve patient stenoses &gt; 70 % invasive X-ray angiography . We hypothesize CorCTA-derived measurement accurate diagnosis hemodynamically significant coronary artery stenosis , use FFR reference standard patient coronary artery stenoses &gt; 70 % .</detailed_description>
