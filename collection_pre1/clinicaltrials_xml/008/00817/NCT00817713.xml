	<brief_summary>This study focus one major health issue Sub-Saharan Africa : multi-parasitism co-infections . In particular study aim elucidate interaction helminth HIV . There good reason suspect detrimental effect helminth infection course HIV infection . We hypothesize , treatment helminth HIV- helminth co-infected individual lead reduction HIV viral load . With low HIV RNA level one would expect slow decline CD4 cell hence also slow progression disease . Ideally would lead prolongation chronic phase HIV infection delay time anti-retroviral treatment need start .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>* Background : On basis immunological consideration vitro trial co-infections strong reason suspect detrimental effect helminth infection course HIV . The immunological answer efficiently evoke helminth infection aim hijack suppress immune system order suit requirement specific helminth . This permit helminth cause chronic infection , often persist year allow infect worm grow several centimetre length within host . However , immune modulation also affect non-related antigen ( example HIV ) would actually require different line immunological action . Some clinical trial able confirm detrimental effect helminth HIV infection , trial fail . A recent Cochrane review clinical trial HIV helminth co-infection find overall slight reduction HIV viral load helminth infection treat . However measurable effect CD4 count clinical staging HIV . This might explain fact trial heterogeneous set-up run short time ( max 6 month ) allow sufficient answer question . According mathematical model , even relatively modest reduction HIV RNA 0.5 log could delay need start combine antiretroviral therapy 3.5 year potentially prolong symptom-free phase HIV-infection nearly 1 year . On population scale could lead substantial saving regard drug clinical cost individual level invaluable gain drug-free ideally also symptom-free life year . - Objective : To assess impact presumptive anthelminthic treatment HIV progression patient infected HIV rural setting presume high prevalence helminth infection . - Methods : Randomised open-label trial presumptive triple anthelminthic treatment HIV positive patient yet require anti-retroviral treatment .</detailed_description>
