	<brief_summary>Bronchiolitis common low respiratory disease typically affect infant child generally young 2 year age . The disease lead hospital admission , major cause hospitalisation young child infant winter epidemic , may severe sometimes require ventilatory support rarely death . The clinical disease describe Court characterise nasal flaring , tachypnoea , dyspnoea , chest recession , crepitation sometimes sibiliations . Respiratory Syncytial virus common cause , also respiratory vira may cause disease . Bronchiolitis well know risk factor asthma development childhood1,2 . Management generally supportive , whereas symptom reduce therapy debate international consensus . Furthermore , many unresolved question relate prognosis bronchiolitis , role development chronic lung disease particular regard association early bronchiolitis asthma development . The present project particularly focus : 1 ) Treatment efficacy relate various outcome active disease , 2 ) retrospectively assess treatment efficacy relation later development allergic disease , 3 ) ass role different vira asthma prognosis well 4 ) identify possible prognostic factor involve progression bronchiolitis airways disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OVERALL AIMS OF THE STUDY : 1 . To compare efficacy two common treatment determine whether inhalation treatment racemic adrenaline effective saline inhalation acute bronchiolitis child young 12 month throughout hospital admission , well define optimal inhalation treatment interval . 2 . To identify clinical virological risk factor development persist obstructive airway disease initial bronchiolitis , ass specific vira subsequent asthma development influence efficacy bronchiolitis management . 3 . To assess whether hospital admission bronchiolitis increase parallel increase childhood asthma see last 10-15 year . METHODS AND STUDY PROGRESSION Design : This multicenter study perform initial appropriate common training participate . 1 . Treatment study : The study follow standard operating procedure Good Clinical Practice , include clinical monitor Oslo University Hospital , Ullevål provide study quality assurance center . Two main group randomise RA v saline , divide two arm active drug/NaCl group : fix demand inhalation . The trial double blind pharmacy . One glass sufficient medication entire hospital stay designate per patient throughout . No cross-over . Outcomes analysed intention treat , treatment give record throughout hospital admission . No interim analysis plan since study compare two establish treatment modality use last decade . Inclusion treatment study provide basis follow-up ( prognosis ) part study . 2 . Prognosis : 18 month follow-up study ( clinical assessment ) subject treatment study.The prognosis study also retrospectively answer whether treatment efficacy depend upon later allergic disease development . 3 . Epidemiology : retrospective chart study hospital admission bronchiolitis within population refer collaborate centre HSØ 1995-2009 Methods : . Treatment : Randomisation : block randomisation . Randomization perform computer program ORAACLE statistician , provide Pharmacy prepare label vial patient . Treatment : Nebulised racemic adrenaline v saline throughout hospital stay . Inhalations give demand ( parents/nurse ) v fix x 4 -- 12 . Open saline inhalation may give time , inhalation allow . Neither systemic corticosteroid ( proper treatment acute bronchiolitis , accord Norwegian guideline ) . All treatment give accord usual local practice . Study end-points : 1 . Treatment study : Completion study discharge + possible re-admission accord protocol . Need intensive care management assist ventilation ( continuous CPAP-Ventilator ) conventional management give . Treatment failure child assess severely ill need open label treatment . These data record analysed see difference two treatment group . We expect small number drop-outs , make necessary expand study goal 500 patient . 2 . Prognosis study : Number child recurrent bronchial obstruction ( wheeze ) , secondary : asthma diagnosis , `` Oslo severity score '' . 3 . Hospital admission first time , secondary : re-admissions multiple admission Methods : Clinical score assess 30 minute inhalation first time , subsequently day ordinary doctor visit . Global clinical assessment complete nurse parent do every morning even discharge . Time start , end hour naso-gastric tube feed well need supplementary oxygen record daily complication adverse event record appear . Nasopharynx aspiration do inclusion analyse local routine , usually within 24 hour ( except Sundays ) . Half aspirate frozen batch PCR analyse virological laboratory ( Oslo University Hospital ) patient enrol . Blood test sample inclusion . General analysis ( see table 6 ) sample biobank epigenetic analysis . Saliva sample inclusion follow morning . Deemed fit discharge decide attend physician . Minimum requirement clinical score 3 less least 2 hour last inhalation . Urine test sample inclusion . Will analyse leukotrienes arachidonic acid metabolite ( eoxines ) relevant inflammatory infection marker . Outcomes measure upon inclusion , first inhalation ( clinical score ) well throughout hospital stay accord flow-chart . Main outcome : No hour deem fit discharge hospital Secondary : Need feed support ( . hour ) Need supplementary oxygen . Clinical score throughout admission Complications ( presence time confirm ) atelectasis Global assessment ( parent nurse ) Need ICU treatment Data hospital addition collate data analysis assess independently . Illness cause different vira compare regard treatment efficacy . b. Prognosis : This follow-up-study perform collaboration principal investigator collaborate physician local paediatric department . The clinical follow-up visit include structured parental interview , application `` Oslo severity score '' 20 obstructive airway disease , assessment atopic eczema rhinitis , skin prick test well blood sample analysis include IgE DNA epigenetic study ( see table 4 ) . c. Epidemiology : Retrospective study child 0-18 month admit hospital diagnosis bronchiolitis . The study mainly hospital registry study , 20 % random chart scrutiny ensure appropriateness diagnosis . Ammendment : Two substudies include ; ) Quality life bronchiolitis b ) A population-based control group 241 child Oslo Fredrikstad include . 1 . Description Quality Life : ITQOL send child include RCT cohort , well control group ( see ) 6-9 month enrollement study , well prior 18-month follow-up study . Main objective : To assess quality life acute bronchiolitis infancy associate development persist obstructive airway disease allergic disease early childhood . Specific aim 1 : What quality life infant parent 6 18 month hospital admission acute bronchiolitis ? Specific aim 2 : Is quality life infant parent 6 18 month hospital admission acute bronchiolitis relate recurrent persist obstructive airway symptom ? Specific aim 3 : Is possible association quality life persistent obstructive airway disease modify allergic sensitisation , gender type virus infection bronciolitis 2 . Description Control group : Since establish `` Bronchiolitis '' cohort child admit hospital acute bronchiolitis , prognostic perspective three-phase study gain increase focus . This relate particular immunological influence different viral agent acute disease , well Quality Life role early `` stress '' relation development allergic diseases child well without acute bronchiolitis early life . The aims ass physiological , immunological , environmental `` stress '' ( include psychosocial ) factor development allergic disease , include asthma , atopic eczema , allergic rhinitis allergy child hospital admit due acute bronchiolitis infancy well child age admit bronchiolitis . Control child consecutively include 2 Well-baby clinic Fredrikstad Oslo , respectively , total number 150 ( 100 + 150 , respectively ) ensure similar variability demographic data ( age ethnic background ) enrol bronchiolitis child . Inclusion assess mid-way adequate demographic variability . Inclusion criterion : child 1- 11 month ( inclusive ) age present Well-Baby Clinics , Exclusion criterion : Significant cardiac , previous severe respiratory disease , neurologic , immunologic , oncologic disease may significantly influence outcome , include Down 's syndrome .</detailed_description>
