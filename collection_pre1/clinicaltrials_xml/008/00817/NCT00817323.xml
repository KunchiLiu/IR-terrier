	<brief_summary>PURPOSE The purpose study elucidate whether quetiapine fumurate ( Seroquel ) exert antidepressant activity bipolar disorder alter either serotonergic catecholinergic activity . HYPOTHESIS By deplete either serotonin catecholamine successfully treat bipolar patient , relapse induce reveal neurotransmitter effect receive normal treatment JUSTIFICATION While exact mechanism action classical antidepressant fully understood , strong evidence implicate serotonin noradrenalin necessary ( albeit insufficient ) resolution depression come neurotransmitter depletion study . This biological evidence two neurotransmitter come study paradigm neurotransmitter ( precursor ) selectively effectively deplete patient respond antidepressant either work enhance serotonin ( example , SRI antidepressant ) catecholamine ( secondary amine tricyclic , Reboxetine , etc. ) . It show , replicate , patient respond serotonin enhance drug precipitously dramatically relapse give diet ( often form milkshake ) void tryptophan , precursor serotonin . This diet often contain long-chain amino acid prevent residual tryptophan system enter CNS . These patient relapse tryptophan-free diet tryptophan replete mood improves often short time frame ( example , five hour ) . When technique perform patient respond catecholamine-enhancing drug significant clinical effect . A similar approach take patient respond noradrelanine-enhancing drug . Specifically , catecholamine store deplete use dietary tyrosine . This reduce synthesis catecholamine dopamine thus deplete pre-synaptic noradrenaline . For patient respond noradrenaline-enhancing drug , result relapse term depressive symptomatology . When dietary tyrosine strategy apply serotonin responder , significant clinical effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study would conduct single site : University British Columbia . This study would involve recruitment out-patient responder quetiapine previously diagnosis bipolar disorder , depressed phase . These patient could randomize receive either serotonergic catecholinergic depletion , tryptophan tyrosine depletion respectively . Baseline assessment would conduct prior subject enter active phase depletion . As depletion phase short , i.e . number day , phase trial would relatively short ( i.e . one week ) . Participants see clinician pre-depletion screen visit occurs ( maximum ) 7 day prior commence depletion . In addition physical examination take medical history , inclusion/exclusion criterion verify , ECG take hospital cardiologist , blood urine sample collect standard haematology/urinalysis , baseline assessment amino acid neurotransmitter level . Patients would maintain original dose Quetiapine throughout course study . Amino acid neurotransmitter concentration determine on-site , mean HPLC . All depletion drink mix 300ml juice , cover taste amino acid mixture prepare . Male participant receive tyrosine-free formula , drink mixture amino acid administer work Sheenan et al ( 1996 ) : L-isoleucine ( 7.5g ) ; L-leucine ( 11.25g ) , L-lysine monohydrochloride ( 8.75g ) , L-methionine ( 2.5g ) , L-valine ( 8.75g ) , L-threonine ( 5g ) ; L-tryptophan ( 1.25g ) . Female subject receive drink composition , 20 % less weight amino acid . Similarly , tryptophan-free formula male prepare Hughes et al ( 2000 , ( Hughes , Dunne &amp; Young 2000 ) ) , formula 20 % less , weight , amino acid use female : L-alanine ( 5.5g ) ; L-arginine ( 4.9g ) ; L-cysteine ( 2.7g ) ; L-glycine ( 3.2g ) ; L-histidine 3.2g ) ; L-isoleucine ( 8g ) ; L-leucine ( 13.5 ) ; L-lysine monohydrochloride ( 11g ) ; L-methionine ( 3g ) ; L-phenylalanine ( 5.7g ) ; L-proline ( 12.2g ) ; L-serine ( 6.9g ) ; L-threonine ( 6.5g ) ; L-tyrosine ( 6.9g ) ; L-valine ( 8.9g ) . The depletion post-depletion monitoring occur daily five ( 5 ) day , depletion begin Monday , unless circumstance require otherwise . Participants instruct low-protein diet day prior second visit ( total content le 20g ) , fast midnight visit . Subjects arrive clinic 9AM day 1 commence depletion , supervision screen physician , monitor subject next four day , include 0- 4-hours post-depletion . At 24 hour post-depletion , blood sample drawn analysis amino acid neurotransmitter level ( 5mL ) . Subjects hospitalized participation , unless deem necessary clinician 's judgment , give 24-hour contact information attend physician . The physician see give subject duration participation , raters involve study previously demonstrate inter-rater reliability 0.85 scale . At visit ( 1-5 ) , subject mood assess use Visual Analog Scale , self-rating , Hamilton Rating-Scale Depression . Concomitant medication also record . At final visit ( 96-hours post-depletion ) , follow-up physical examination perform .</detailed_description>
