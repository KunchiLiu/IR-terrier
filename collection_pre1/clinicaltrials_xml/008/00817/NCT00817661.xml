	<detailed_description>Influenza morbidity affect entire population enormous impact upon economic burden health care system , particularly cause serious illness among young infant 0-6 month age . Recent study show high rate influenza illness hospitalization among infant age group industrialized country ( Chiu et al. , 2002 ; Poehling et al. , 2006 ) influenza relate childhood mortality high young infant 6 month age ( Bhat et al. , 2005 ) . Unfortunately , inactivate influenza vaccine recommend age group , pregnant woman vaccinate 2nd - 3rd trimester . Thus strategy passive immunization ( mother ) infant effective way combat infection among young infant . This approach adopt US since 1997 recommend WHO since 2005 . Upper respiratory tract portal virus entry primary site replication ( Gluck et al. , 1994 ; Muszkat et al. , 2000 ) . Thus importance presence effective mucosal antibody entry site virus essential neutralize virus prevent infection ( Meitin et al. , 1994 ) . Secretory IgA ( sIgA ) primary mucosal antibody , account ~70 % body 's total antibody production ( Brandtzaeg , 1994 ) . sIgA show mediate nasal anti-influenza mucosal immunity ( Renegar &amp; Small , 1991 ) therefore indicate importance vaccination strategy trigger specific antibody production mucosal surface well importance dietary nutrient trigger release mucosal neuropeptides necessary maintenance mucosal immune system ( Renegar et al. , 2001 ) . A number clinical trial examine effect vitamin A supplementation humans indicator mucosal immunity . Supplementation human immunodeficiency virus infect pregnant woman associate improved gut permeability infants 14 week measure lactulose/mannitol ( L/M ) urinary excretion test ( Filteau et al. , 1999 ) . While vitamin A supplementation pregnancy ( Semba et al. , 1999 ) early postpartum period ( Filteau et al. , 2001 ) show effect total sIgA breast milk , rather vitamin A milk show inhibit growth envelop non-enveloped virus ( Clarke &amp; May , 2000 ) . However , total sIgA level vitamin A-sufficient child detect significantly high vitamin A-deficient child ( Lin et al. , 2007 ) . In animal model , vitamin A supplementation increase total antigen specific sIgA-containing cell mucosa , turn improves survival rate ( Nikawa et al. , 2001 ) During early infancy breast milk predominant source vitamin A date study investigates effect prenatal vitamin A supplementation vaccination vaccine specific mucosal sIgA response offspring . Although maternal IgA transplacentally transfer infant , increase vitamin A vaccine specific sIgA breast milk result maternal vitamin A supplementation may enhance infant 's nasal sIgA response turn may provide improve passive protection among young infant . In recent study ( Mother'SGift Project , fund Thrasher Research Fund ) , detect maternal influenza vaccination reduce influenza illness substantially young infant 6 month age Bangladesh ( Zaman et al. , 2008 ) . On hand prevalence vitamin A deficiency among pregnant woman Bangladesh well develop country high . More half pregnant woman Bangladesh consume less vitamin A recommend dietary allowance low vitamin A status ( serum retinol &lt; 1•05 μmol/L ) approximately one-fifth classified deficient ( serum retinol &lt; 0•70 μmol/L ) ( Ahmed et al. , 2003 ; Lee et al. , 2008 ) . Nonetheless , conclusive scientific evidence suggest several aspect innate adaptive immunity compromise clinical subclinical vitamin A deficiency ( Stephensen , 2001 ) . In another study , observe significant positive association primary yellow fever viral vaccine specific lymphocyte blastogenesis / antibody responses body vitamin A store ( Ahmad et al. , 2008 ) . Thus view potential immune regulatory role vitamin A , interest investigate whether maternal vitamin A supplementation along influenza vaccination could use public health intervention strategy combat influenza infection vitamin A deficiency simultaneously among mother young infant develop country . Research Design Methods : Study Site : This study carry ICDDR , B ; Dhaka , Bangladesh . Three urban maternity clinic locate Mirpur area Dhaka city select approach mother visit clinic first trimester residence nearby community . Study Subject : The inclusion criterion enroll mother begin second trimester ( i.e . approximately 12 week gestation ) , willing stay Dhaka pregnancy willing admit clinic delivery . The gestational age determine self-reported LMP , likely underestimated case . A two-week variation acceptable propose study . The exclusion criterion : history systemic disease , previous complicate pregnancy pre-term delivery , abortion , congenital anomaly , hypersensitivity influenza vaccine receipt vaccine . Overview Experimental Design : This placebo-controlled , double-masked randomized trial . The overall study design outline Figure 1 , timeline hypothetical duration propose protocol related activity illustrate Table 1 . To allow schedule sample collection , storage assay number hire field attendant lab facility available , plan enter approximately five pregnant mother per week study first three-month period study ( Table 1 ) . Informed write consent obtain mother . Sixty-six pregnant woman randomize receive either weekly 10,000 IU vitamin A placebo ( corn oil ) capsule blood collect serum vitamin A assessment . Randomization stratify three clinic use balanced block design . This weekly supplementation continue 6 month postpartum . The supplement vitamin A dose use study similar dos use weekly among pregnant woman study ( Semba et al. , 1999 ; Cox et al. , 2006 ) show safe . Field worker deliver supplement mother , person directly observe consumption . At 26-28 week gestation , mother receive inactivate , trivalent influenza virus vaccine ( GlaxoSmithKline ; Dresden , Germany ) . Standard inactivate trivalent influenza A/H3N2 , A/H1N1 , B strain recommend WHO Northern Hemisphere obtain commercial source project . Study physician administer vaccine intramuscularly . At delivery , cord blood colostrum collect Influenza specific IgG sIgA assessment respectively well vitamin A concentration . Birth weight length newborn baby also record . At 6-month , breast milk collect vitamin A influenza virus specific sIgA assessment venous blood ( 2-3 ml ) infant ( 6 mo age ) obtain vitamin A influenza virus specific IgG assessment well infant ' nasal washing influenza virus specific sIgA assessment . Our propose study hamper exist prenatal care mother folate/iron supplementation exist infant vaccination program Bangladesh . Randomization : Each mother give unique randomly generate identification number , indicate study group assign . The ID label bottle contain 60 capsule . Field attendant use capsule weekly supplementation ensure ID mother bottle ID . A third party ( ACME laboratory , Dhaka Bangladesh ) prepare supply vitamin A placebo capsule bottle , label ID number list number . The responsible personnel keep confidential end study Sample collection : Peripheral blood mother , cord blood , colostrum , breast milk , peripheral blood nasal washing infant collect described Figure 1 . Nasal secretion obtain introduce wick ( cotton applicator ) nostril gently rotate 90 describe previously ( Wright et al. , 1996 ) . The wick extract 1mL PBS , centrifuge , supernatant collect . All sample frozen test simultaneously . Serological evaluation : We choose investigate humoral immune responses one influenza antigen purpose propose study evaluate effect maternal vitamin A supplementation infant ' passive antibody level , thus prudent investigate immune responses one antigen . The following parameter vitamin A Influenza A specific humoral immunity test . Vitamin A assessment : Vitamin A content plasma , serum , colostrum breast milk measure standard HPLC method place Nutritional Biochemistry Lab LSD . Hemagglutination inhibition test [ HAI ] : HAI antibody titer measure standard microtiter assay ( Admon et al. , 1997 ) . 12 HA unit select Influenza A vaccine strain add dilute pre-treated serum receptor destroy enzyme ( RDE , Sigma MO ) heat inactivation . Following incubation , wash chicken erythrocytes added sedimentation ensues control well . HAI titer inverse high dilution serum exhibit complete HAI . Influenza-specific IgG sIgA ELISA : Influenza virus A specific IgG serum/plasma sIgA colostrum , breast milk infant nasal swab analyze ELISA describe previously minor modification ( Bruhl et al. , 2000 ; Greenbaum et al. , 2004 ) . Briefly immunoplates coat purified influenza antigen obtain NIBSC 2 ug/mL overnight 40C . dilute sample add another overnight incubation . HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG ( BD-Pharmingen , CA ) mouse anti-sIgA , peroxidase-labeled ( Alpco Diagnostics , NH ) use conjugate . To construct standard curve , serial dilution pool sample assign arbitrary value introduce ELISA plate . Total sIgA colostrum , breast milk infant nasal swab also determine EIA kit ( Alpco Diagnostics ) adjust influenza A specific sIgA response respect overall sIgA secretion .</detailed_description>
