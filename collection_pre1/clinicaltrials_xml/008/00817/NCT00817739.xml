	<brief_summary>This study aim evaluate effect intermittent hormonal treatment complete androgen suppression ( Leuprorelin 3.75 milligram [ mg ] sustain release [ SR ] Flutamide ) patient present stage D2 Tx Nx M1 ≠ M1a metastatic prostrate cancer , prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level 5-fold high normal ( PSA great equal [ ≥ ] 20 nanogram per milliliter [ ng/mL ] , quantitated Hybritech radioimmunoassay ) subsequent decline normal ( PSA less [ &lt; ] 4 ng/mL ) initial 6 month induction treatment . The result compare obtained continuous hormonal therapy complete androgen suppression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open , comparative , randomize ( 1:1 ) , multicenter , European ( France , Germany , Czech Republic , Slovakia Bulgaria ) , Phase 2B study parallel group patient present metastatic prostate cancer ( stage D2 Tx Nx M1 ≠ M1a ) , PSA level ≥ 5-fold high normal ( PSA ≥ 20 ng/mL , quantitated Hybritech radioimmunoassay ) return normal within 6 month initiation total androgen blockade therapy leuprorelin 3.75 mg SR flutamide . It involve 314 preselected patient . A minimum 180 eligible patient require study . Selected patient randomize centrally two parallel group study entry . This phase 2B study enable evaluation high number patient direct comparison conventional administration . The study comprise two therapeutic phase : - A 6 month induction phase complete androgen suppression leuprorelin 3.75 mg SR flutamide . This phase involve patient meet preselection criterion . - A data processing run per complete androgen suppression accord two method , continuous intermittent , patient satisfy criterion selection study thus randomize . The selected patient randomize two parallel group time inclusion : - Group A patient receive continuous complete androgen suppression therapy leuprorelin 3.75mg SR flutamide , appearance sign disease progression study end . - Group B patient receive intermittent complete androgen suppression therapy leuprorelin 3.75 mg SR flutamide , study end appearance sign disease progression treatment . Group A patient routinely followed-up 3-month basis sign disease progression . Group B patient ( intermittent therapy ) monitor every 3 month on-treatment period condition describe group A . The 3-month clinical follow-up off-treatment period , PSA increase ≥10 ng/mL patient must contact schedule prompt special visit order reinstitute hormonal therapy . Subsequent visit schedule 3-month basis time special visit . Special visit routine consultation , except laboratory test redo . When on-therapy tumor progression document , every 6 month investigator note treatment administer patient death ( specify cause death ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm metastatic cancer prostate ( stage D2 Tx Nx M1 ≠ M1a ) measurable bone visceral ( lung , liver , etc . ) metastasis ( radiographic conformation necessary event questionable bone scan detection conjunction slightly elevate PSA level [ least 20 ng/mL less equal 50 ng/mL ] ) . The prostatic carcinoma could diagnose earlier stage treat without castration . Metastatic cancer prostate require firstline therapy . Preassessment PSA 5fold high standard level set central laboratory , , PSA great equal ( ≥ ) 20 ng/mL quantitated Hybritech radioimmunoassay ( normal less [ &lt; ] 4 ng/mL ) . ECOG performance status 2 . Normal testosterone level accord central laboratory standard . Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.25fold high standard level set central laboratory ( except liver metastasis present ) . Anticipated life expectancy great 9 month . Written informed consent give participate collaborate study . Inclusion Criteria Continuous Intermittent Treatment Phase Subjects meet preassessment criterion PSA &lt; 4 ng/mL 6 month induction therapy . Subject refuse sign inform consent form likely uncooperative comply obligation set study protocol . Subject receive prior hormonal ( neoadjuvant ) treatment prompt medical castration ( estrogen , hormonereleasing hormone agonist , androgen ) undergo surgical castration . Subject undergone bilateral suprarenalectomy hypophysectomy . Subject another cancer ( except basiloma ) past 5 year . Subject serious unstable progressive disease ( renal , hepatic , cardiovascular , psychological , etc ) . Subject receive receive another experimental treatment within 3 month prior inclusion . Exclusion Criteria Continuous Intermittent Treatment Phase Subjects meet preassessment criterion , 6 month induction therapy , PSA ≥ 4 ng/mL and/or ontreatment sign disease progression .</criteria>
