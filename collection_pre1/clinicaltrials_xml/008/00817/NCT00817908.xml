	<brief_summary>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) common cause illness patient undergone transplant . Serious infection due CMV affect many part body include lung , gut , liver . Since transplant recipient risk CMV evidence infection CMV , give antiviral drug ( usually ganciclovir valganciclovir ) . Despite , chance CMV infection may cause problem future . The purpose study assess well patients'immune system respond CMV virus , future may possible predict patient high risk CMV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantiferon - Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Prediction CMV Infection In High Risk Solid Organ Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CMV common viral infection solid organ transplantation ( SOT ) associate significant morbidity1 . Without prophylaxis , CMV disease occur first 3 month post-transplant period intense immunosuppresion.2 SOT recipients great risk seronegative recipient organ seropositive donor ( CMV D+/R- ) .3 , 4 Antiviral agent proven useful prevention CMV infection disease SOT recipient , include high-risk D+/R- patients.5-9 Upon completion prophylaxis however , CMV infection disease occur 50 % 25-30 % respectively D+/R- SOT recipient within first year transplant [ 30 % rate investigator treat CMV disease PV16000 ] .9 The incidence CMV infection follow prophylaxis D+/R- lung transplant recipient may high 80 % .10 As CMV disease occur prophylaxis continue impact morbidity mortality SOT recipient , would desirable able predict patient develop complication . Currently , reliable method routinely available predict risk CMV infection disease individual patient . CMV viral load test prophylaxis D+/R- patient show poor predictive value subsequent CMV disease.11 CMV serology ( measure humoral immunity ) also show marginal use predict risk late onset disease.12 Cell mediate immunity ( CMI ) know important humoral immunity control CMV infection . CMV infection elicit strong virus specific CD4+ CD8+ T-cell response . CD8+ T-cell response virus often contain multiple antigen-specific reactivity include viral pp65 IE-1 antigen well pp50 , glycoprotein B , IE-2 antigens.13 CD4+ T cell also play part CMV control via promotion priming , expansion maintenance CD8+ CMV-specific CTLs.14 Measuring individual 's CMI response CMV may useful predictor risk CMV infection disease prophylaxis . Patients poor CMI response ( especially poor CD8+ T-cell response ) could target longer course antiviral prophylaxis . Cell mediate immunity test Most previous study focus CTL response CMV phosphoprotein pp65.15-17 However , since CD8+ T-cell response CMV often contain multiple antigen-specific reactivity , measurement CMI use epitope restrict single protein may yield adequate result . In conjunction Dr. Rajiv Khanna ( Queensland Institute Medical Research , Australia ) , Cellestis Ltd ( Sydney , Australia ) , do preliminary validation assessment CMI ( Quantiferon-CMV ) assay measure IFN-Î³ response range T-cell epitope CMV viral protein include pp65 , pp50 , glycoprotein gB , immediate early IE-1 antigen specific wide range HLA class I specificities [ See Appendix Table 1 ] . The assay employ peptide pool stimulation whole blood suitable routine clinical use evaluation multicenter study . The Quantiferon-CMV assay compare ELISPOT assay study involve 37 healthy volunteer 25 SOT recipients.18 In study , Quantiferon-CMV assay least sensitive ELISPOT CMV epitopes , sensitive CMV epitope . In addition , Quantiferon-CMV result highly correlated CMV serostatus , healthy volunteer transplant recipient . In another study,19 Quantiferon-CMV assay use HIV-infected individual without history CMV disease . The CMV specific immune response measure Quantiferon-CMV assay high patient without history CMV disease , suggest positive result Quantiferon-CMV may predict likelihood develop protective immune response CMV .</detailed_description>
