	<detailed_description>This trial examine upregulation dexamethasone-inducible gene tumor ovarian cancer patient undergo surgical debulking . A core biopsy tumor take first opportune time surgery . Dexamethasone 20 mg IV administer , second biopsy take 30 minute later . Samples two four hour later also obtain surgery still progress biopsiable tumor remain . Tissue snap-frozen . Subsequently tumor microdissected stroma , tumor RNA extract gene expression profile . Sixteen patient epithelial ovarian cancer receive dexamethasone study , additional eight patient epithelial ovarian cancer receive small saline ( placebo ) injection serve control . Enrollment limit patient serum albumin least 3.0 g/dL minimize theoretical adverse effect single dose dexamethasone wound healing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject intraabdominal disease either proven strongly suspect ovarian primary peritoneal cancer , undergo surgical debulking . Subject allergic dexamethasone , obvious medical contraindication dexamethasone . Subjects diabetes require drug therapy exclude . Subject currently receive glucocorticoid therapy Nasal steroid ( e.g . Flonase ) permit Subject understands protocol therapeutic intent Preoperative serum albumin least 3.0 mg/dL Negative serum urine pregnancy test woman childbearing potential Signed inform consent Males get ovarian cancer therefore include trial . Patients ethnic background eligible encourage enroll . However expect difference base ethnicity , small study therefore power make conclusion ethnic difference induction GRregulated gene dexamethasone .</criteria>
