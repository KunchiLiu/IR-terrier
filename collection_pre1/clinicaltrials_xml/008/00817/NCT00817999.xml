	<detailed_description>This study examine effect GFJ loading dose ( 300 mg ) clopidogrel evaluate effect GFJ maintenance dose ( 75 mg/day ) clopidogrel . Subjects randomize either initially receive GFJ prior load dose clopidogrel receive GFJ prior second load dose . The subject randomize receive GFJ initially drink two small can ( 11 oz total ) regular strength GFJ morning , follow two hour later load dose ( 300 mg ) clopidogrel return clinic 6 hour load dose platelet inhibition measure . Subjects ~ 5 milliliter ( 1 teaspoonful ) whole blood drawn antecubital vein forearm via 21 gauge needle attach blue-top plastic vacuette sodium citrate blood collection ( Greiner , Monroe , NC ) tube test inhibition platelet aggregation . After first load dose , 2 week washout period follow allow platelet aggregation return normal . Following washout period , subject take second loading dose clopidogrel return clinic platelet inhibition measurement . The timing follow load dose take without prior GFJ . During maintenance dose phase study , subject take 75 mg/day clopidogrel 7 day without GFJ . Subjects randomize either GFJ first period GFJ second period . A minimum 2 week washout period occur two 7 day course clopidogrel . Platelet inhibition measurement occur end 7 day period describe .</detailed_description>
