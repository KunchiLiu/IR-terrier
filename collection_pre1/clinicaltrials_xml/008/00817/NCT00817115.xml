	<brief_title>Evaluation Exposure Reduction Using Region-of-Interest Fluoroscopy ( X-ray Fovea Imaging ) Cardiac Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>X-ray catheterization use guide minimally invasive procedure include percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCIs ) , involve diffuse multiple vessel disease total chronic occlusion well electrophysiology ( EP ) procedure . While medical benefit patient outweigh procedural risk , long fluoroscopy time associate complex intervention result acute radiation injury patient . Radiation induce cancer also become concern young patient population . With increased number , diversity complexity intervention perform , grow interest reduce long-term exposure risk medical personnel ( interventionists ) . Conventional method reduce radiation exposure , however , impact often degrade diagnostic image quality . Catheterization procedure focus small portion anatomy form central region image periphery provide contextual information . Thus , decrease image quality periphery provide overall exposure reduction patient interventionists without impact diagnosis . This achieve introducing pre-patient region-of-interest ( ROI ) attenuator collimate primary x-ray beam , reduce exposure peripheral region decrease integral radiation patient scatter radiation interventionist . The goal study investigate exposure dose reduction provide ROI image patient interventionists undergo catheterization examine feasibility use ROI attenuator routine clinical practice future integration commercial x-ray image system . The aim obtain exposure dose data cardiac angiography image subject undergoing routine interventional procedure perform without ROI attenuation ( experimental control group , respectively ) . For experimental group , interventionists perform procedure determine appropriate application ROI attenuator duration use specific patient lesion . An internal pilot study initially conduct approximately 30 patient ( 15 per group ) obtain estimate patient operator dose reduction variability . The on-going clinical trial perform additional 40 patient ( final protocol procedure recruitment refine base result pilot study ) .</detailed_description>
