	<brief_title>Tu Salud Si Cuenta Worksite : Pilot Intervention Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity increase past three decade ( Wang &amp; Beydoun , 2007 ; Wang &amp; Zhang , 2002 ) , predict increase future 2048 American adult would overweight ( Wang , Beydoun , Liang , Caballero , Kumanyika , 2008 ) . Moreover , majority Mexican American men woman predict overweight obese 2030 ( 91.1 % 86.7 % respectively ) . The propose intervention research study build exist intervention strategy design Mexican American population entitle Tu Salud Si Cuenta . This intervention highlight medium successful role model change food choice physical activity level . In addition intervention design environmental change help community member carry recommended behavior change strategy . Outcomes interest study include increased physical activity achieve CDC/ACSM recommendation 150 minute moderate vigorous physical activity week ( Haskell et al. , 2007 ) , eat 5 serving fruit vegetable day , reduce food portion size , subsequent change biomarkers health . This propose worksite pilot study test new feature TSSC intervention design worksite promotion intervention strategy promote physical activity healthful food choice environmental change strategy worksite . The full scope behavioral clinical outcome interest examine pilot . The participant study male female employee two worksites , age 18-65 year . A convenience sample use study . Employees State Department Public Health Region 11 Harlingen Office City Brownsville recruit . Supervisors sit provide letter support project agree allow recruitment . Employees contact informational flyer e-mails send supervisor provide letter support . Interested adults sent interest letter inform consent . Data collection proceed participant complete informed consent form provide documentation physician 's clearance participate physical activity . The purpose study test efficacy worksite-based physical activity healthful food choice , intervention among two worksites Lower Rio Grande Valley employ primarily Mexican American personnel . Persons complete consent form enrollment/pretest period 4 week . This period include electronic pre-test survey use Survey Monkey online software ( Finley , 2008 ) complete participant . Additionally , clinical measure blood pressure , anthropometrics , fast total cholesterol , triglyceride glucose collect participant . These exam conduct trained staff clinical research unit follow identical procedure use member Hispanic Health Research Cohort . Finally , line Centers Disease Control Prevention , participant encourage visit personal physician discus participation recommend 150 minute physical activity per week . All individual give exit interview register phlebotomist register nurse review immediate finding . All sample laboratory test storage cod identifier remove . Participants also provide write summary include height , weight , waist circumference , blood pressure , fast glucose , cholesterol triglyceride . Values expect range flag referral make necessary . This interview also use address question concern may raise . Descriptive analysis use compare characteristic participant intervention control group intend compare respect outcome interest , ( e.g. , blood pressure ) . Specifically , compare group respect demographic socio-economic factor age , sex , ethnicity , education level . Since outcome measurement baseline follow quarterly visit ( 3 month , 6 month , etc ) expect correlated , use Generalized Estimating Equations ( GEE ) model . GEE take account correlation outcome measure repeatedly time treat nuisance parameter ( Zeger &amp; Liang , 1986 ) . As result , within-subjects correlation model explicitly . GEE use `` work correlation '' treat within-subjects correlation , produce standard error estimate take account correlation responses subject . In addition , use Random effect model ( Wolfinger &amp; O'Connell , 1993 ) adjust heterogeneity subject , due unmeasured predisposition , genetic factor , account correlation within subject across time . Estimated effect covariate interest ( e.g. , male vs. female ) adjust individual difference model estimate interpret term change due covariate individual give level random subject effect . The random effect model useful inference individual difference primary interest . Random effect model develop continuous binary outcome variable ( Wolfinger et al. , 1993 ) . The study take place 1 year time frame . Participants data collect prior intervention four posttests 3-month interval . The immediate intervention group receive pilot worksite intervention initial 12 week period . The delayed intervention group receive pilot worksite intervention begin month 3 study .</detailed_description>
