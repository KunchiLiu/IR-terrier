	<brief_summary>Targeting blood supply cancer , call anti-angiogenesis new proven treatment strategy . There two way achieve effect . The first way specifically target molecular pathway promote new blood vessel formation cancer . An example agent sorafenib , oral agent already use worldwide treatment kidney liver cancer . The second way target cell line blood vessel use low dose chemotherapy agent administer frequent interval . This strategy call metronomic chemotherapy . It possible combine agent like sorafenib metronomic chemotherapy may enhance anti-cancer effect . This study aim determine optimal way combine oral vinorelbine metronomic dos sorafenib . Oral vinorelbine chemotherapy agent already approve use cancer treatment lung cancer . By combine oral anti-cancer agent optimize anti-angiogenic effect study , potential benefit patient tremendous far-reaching . Special radiologic imaging blood test incorporate study help understand anti-angiogenic process agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Combination Metronomic Oral Vinorelbine Sorafenib Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I Dose-finding study : The patient divide 3 cohort ( 15 patient per cohort ) , cohort receive fix metronomic ( thrice week ) dose oral vinorelbine 60 mg/week , 90 mg/week , 120 mg/week respectively . Each patient within cohort receive start dose sorafenib 200 mg bid 4 week . In absence dose-limiting toxicity , dose sorafenib escalate 400 mg bid another 4 week , 600 mg bid 4 week finally 800 mg bid . We arrive 3 different MTDs 3 cohort . Once MTD determine cohort , recruit additional 12 patient cohort study PK profile drug . The 12 patient cohort sequentially alternate group 1 group 2 treatment schedule . Group 1 ( N=6 patient cohort ) receive vinorelbine three time per week start Monday ( Day 1 ) follow Wednesday ( Day 3 ) Friday ( Day 5 ) . In subsequent week vinorelbine give work day ( i.e . Monday , Wednesday Friday ) . The first PK profile vinorelbine ( without concomitant sorafenib ) determine Day 15 steady state condition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm NSCLC 2 . At least one 2 prior line chemotherapy , include oral EGFR tyrosinekinase inhibitor metastatic disease locally advance unresectable disease . There least 4 week since prior chemotherapy radiation therapy ; patient decline conventional chemotherapy oral EGFR tyrosinekinase inhibitor salvage 2nd 3rd line treatment also eligible . 3 . Minimum bodysurface area ( BSA ) 1.4 m2 point recruitment . This safeguard recruit smallbuilt patient may experience adverse reaction absolute dose oral vinorelbine . At body surface area , maximum dose oral vinorelbine 120 mg/week equivalent 86 mg/m2/week patient BSA 1.4 m2 . 4 . Age &gt; 21 year 5 . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) 6 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/mcL , absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL , platelet count &gt; 100,000/mcL , serum bilirubin within normal institutional limit , AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X upper limit normal , creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient . These test must do within 1 week study treatment . 7 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document 1 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier 2 . Patients receive investigational agent 3 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event 4 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Oral Vinorelbine agent use study 5 . Prior / concomitant treatment drug know induce inhibit cytochrome P450 3A4 : phenytoin , carbamazepine , barbiturate , rifampicin , imidazole antifungal ( ketoconazole , fluconazole , itraconazole , metronidazole ) , omeprazole ritonavir . Patients take gastric acidlowering agent H2 antagonist antacid evaluate regard need continue medication . If discontinuation medication medically contraindicate , patient exclude agent know low solubility sorafenib hence may limit efficacy . 6 . Significant malabsorption syndrome disease affect gastrointestinal tract function 7 . Significant peripheral autonomic neuropathy affect sensation bowel motility 8 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement 9 . Uncontrolled hypertension define systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg despite optimal management 10 . Pregnancy breastfeed woman childbearing potential use effective contraception 11 . Evidence history bleed diathesis coagulopathy 12 . Thrombotic embolic event cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack within past 6 month 13 . Pulmonary hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE grade 2 within 4 week recruitment 14 . Any hemorrhage/bleeding event &gt; CTCAE grade 3 within 4 week recruitment</criteria>
