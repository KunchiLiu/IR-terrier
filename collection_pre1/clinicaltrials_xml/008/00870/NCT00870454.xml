	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study Carisbamate Treatment Nerve Pain Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither investigator patient know name study assign drug ) , placebo- active-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study , optional extension phase , patient diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) , nerve pain low extremity result diabetes . The study population include men woman 18 75 year age chronic neuropathic pain associate diabetic neuropathy . Up 440 subject enrol randomly assign ( like flip coin ) 1:1:1:1 ratio treatment carisbamate 800 milligram per day ( mg/d ) , carisbamate 1,200 mg/d , pregabalin 300 mg/d , placebo . The double-blind treatment administer orally , twice-daily regimen , without food , period 15 week . The study consist pretreatment phase , include screening , washout , baseline period ; double-blind treatment phase , titration fixed-dosage period ; optional blind extension phase ( carisbamate 400 1,200 mg/d pregabalin 150 300 mg/d ) ; posttreatment phase ( include follow-up visit telephone contact ) . The duration study ( exclude pretreatment phase ) approximately 58 week patient decide enter extension phase approximately 19 week patient . The pretreatment phase last 28 day , include screen visit 28 day plan first dose study drug , washout 7 day subject need discontinue medication , baseline period least 7 day determine daily average DPN score entry study . The double-blind treatment phase include titration period 3 week determine dosage , fixed-dosage period next 12 week . All patient complete double-blind treatment phase offer option enter blind extension phase additional 37 week , patient previously treat carisbamate placebo receive carisbamate individual dosage end double-blind treatment period , patient previously treat pregabalin receive pregabalin individual dosage end double-blind treatment period . During double-blind extension phase , patient daily assessment pain , use 11-point DPN pain rating scale ; much pain interferes sleep , use 11-point Sleep Interference rating scale . In addition , specific scale use visit ( every week first 4 week , every 4 week end double-blind treatment phase , every 11 12 week extension phase ) ass pain , overall health quality , effect pain daytime sleepiness , effect pain work , activity , health care utilization . Patients remain blinded drug assignment extension phase . The posttreatment phase include follow-up visit 7 14 day final visit double-blind treatment phase ( patient participate extension phase ) extension phase . In addition , investigator staff call patient 30 33 day last dose study drug , ask adverse event . Patients take two oral capsule day , either carisbamate ( 200 400 mg ) , match pregabalin ( 75 150 mg ) , match placebo .</detailed_description>
