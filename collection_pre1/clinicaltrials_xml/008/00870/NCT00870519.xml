	<brief_title>Brain Imaging Study Subjects With Alzheimer Disease Comparison Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall research question address protocol follow : - To assess dynamic uptake washout ( 123I ) MNI-168 , potential imaging biomarker β-amyloid burden brain , use single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) Alzheimer 's ( AD ) subject similarly age gender match healthy control . - To perform blood metabolite characterization ( 123I ) MNI-168 healthy AD subject determine metabolic fate nature metabolites assessment ( 123I ) MNI-168 single photon compute tomography ( SPECT ) brain imaging agent . - To acquire initial safety data follow injection ( 123I ) MNI-168 . - Obtain test/retest reproducibility information AD subject ( 123I ) MNI-168 base initial study .</detailed_description>
