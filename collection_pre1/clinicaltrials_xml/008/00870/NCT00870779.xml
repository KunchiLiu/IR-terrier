	<brief_summary>Removing tumor brain hard , often , brain tumor boundary easy surgeon find . In many case , surgeon ca n't tell exactly tumor begin end . The surgeon usually remove tumor look MRI image take brain surgery . However , surgeon good way tell entire tumor remove . Removing entire tumor important leave tumor behind may allow grow back could decrease chance survival . It possible detect tumor cell make glow specific color light ( process call fluorescence ) . This do take drug , ALA , surgery . ALA molecule already exist cell body . Once enough body , get convert another molecule name PpIX . If blue light shin tumor enough PpIX , glow red light ( fluorescence ) detect special camera . In study , want determine fluorescence ( red light ) relate tumor appear image normally take brain ( surgeon us guide removal tumor ) tumor tissue remove surgery . Removing entire tumor important leave tumor behind may allow grow back could decrease chance survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorescence Guided Resection Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first phase study ( Stage I ) use FI coregistered pMR , iUS iSV image test overall hypothesis high degree spatial correlation local tissue FI signal coregistered conventional imaging correspond histopathology . Additionally , coregistered probe measurement biopsy specimen acquire intraoperatively . Biopsy specimens process post-operatively ( via fluorescence microscopy chemical spectrofluorimetry ) ass PpIX concentration allow direct comparison FI signal strength PpIX production ( base vivo probe data ex vivo histological quantification ) function histological grade . The study protocol outline . Because overall interest importance relate data exist body literature excellent safety record oral administration ALA report trial [ 1 , 33-36 ] , use dose/time schedule describe [ 1 , 33 ] . The operative procedure follow exist practice Dartmouth image-guided resection meningioma , pituitary adenoma metastases additional acquisition FI biopsy data predefined time point relate expected volume tumor tissue . In first phase study , resection decision make base FI data alone . Should residual fluorescence remain intended resection volume remove excision require biopsy confirmation OR . It anticipate 234 patient enrolled Stage I .</detailed_description>
