	<brief_title>Diaphragmatic Mobility Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) characterize progressive obstruction airway partially irreversible . COPD patient commonly present increase resistance airflow , air trapping , pulmonary hyperinflation alters chest wall place respiratory muscle mechanical disadvantage , thereby increase respiratory drive sensation dyspnoea . Furthermore , prevent dyspnoea , COPD patient reduce daily living activity lead loss physical condition , social isolation , depression anxiety , whilst compromising quality life . Forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) main parameter use establish severity pulmonary impairment disease progression . Nevertheless , study suggest FEV1 adequately reflect clinical manifestation disease weakly associate severity dyspnoea , health relate quality life ( HRQOL ) feature , ability perform activity daily live . Moreover , FEV1 appear predictor mortality COPD patient . Pulmonary hyperinflation relate adaptation diaphragm muscle maintain muscle 's capacity generate power whilst reduce displacement . The importance diaphragm lung mechanic associate hyperinflation subject frequent discussion owe widespread use lung volume reduce surgery result increase movement range diaphragm muscle . However , date , relationship diaphragm mobility functional capacity COPD patient remain unknown . The objective present study evaluate influence diaphragm mobility exercise capacity dyspnoea patient COPD .</detailed_description>
