	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Malaria Vaccines Test Safety , Immune Response Protection Against Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study evaluate DNA-Ad vaccine target liver blood stage malaria life cycle safe protective , hop develop vaccine prevent infection and/or lessen severity disease cause P. falciparum malaria parasite . More specifically , DNA-Ad vaccine contain liver stage antigen ( circumsporozoite protein ) antigen ( apical membrane antigen 1 ) present liver blood stage design prevent infection kill majority develop parasite liver prevent severe disease death break-through blood stage infection occur . This study open-label , Phase 1/2a study design assess safety , immunogenicity , efficacy DNA-Ad vaccine healthy adult Ad5 seropositive seronegative . The vaccinated study group consist 20 healthy , malaria-na√Øve adult age 18 50 year , previously screen meet inclusion exclusion criterion receive three prim dos DNA vaccine single dose boost component , adenovirus-vectored vaccine give 4 month last dose DNA . Follow visit occur immunization . The control group consist six non-immunized subject participate challenge assure vaccinate subject indeed expose P. falciparum . Subjects immunized control cohort receive malaria challenge . Subjects assess development parasitemia daily blood smear closely observed hotel challenge . Subjects follow periodically final in-person visit twelve week challenge , follow annual contact phone , email , mailing five year first dose immunization per FDA recommendation .</detailed_description>
