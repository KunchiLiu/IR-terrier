	<detailed_description>Retinopathy Prematurity ( ROP ) lead cause blindness child develop country around world , increase cause blindness develop country . The retina line inside eye . It function `` film '' within camera eye . When infant bear prematurely , vascular network necessary nourish retina fully develop . As consequence , infant abnormal vessel proliferate instead normal one - condition know ROP . The abnormal vessel carry scar tissue along , may lead retinal detachment blindness eye treat . The Multicenter Trial Cryotherapy Retinopathy Prematurity ( CRYO-ROP ) Study demonstrate ablation peripheral avascular retina reduce risk poor structural visual outcome due retinal distortion detachment ROP ( 1980 's ) . The ablated retina functional amenable regeneration . Peripheral retinal ablation universally effective foster regression ROP . This particularly true aggressive form ROP ( aggressive posterior ROP , APROP ) typically afflict profoundly premature infirm neonate . In subset infant , progression ROP bilateral retinal detachment blindness occur despite timely complete peripheral retinal laser ablation . The development ROP largely dependent vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . When infant bear prematurely relatively hyperoxic environment baby introduce shuts production VEGF . Retinal maturation delay . Subsequently , time intraocular VEGF level would normally decline late third trimester pregnancy , abnormally high level VEGF see due large area avascular retina associate tissue hypoxia . The availability FDA-approved drug anti-VEGF treatment render possible treat eye off-label . Available drug include pegaptanib sodium ( Macugen ) partial blockage VEGF-A , drug ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) bevacizumab ( Avastin ) , cause complete blockage VEGF-A . As VEGF require develop retina normal angiogenesis , goal penetrate tissue , block excessive level VEGF trap within overlie vitreous responsible abnormal vasculature ROP . For purpose study choose bevacizumab ( Avastin ) , : ) attain complete blockage ( vs. Macugen ) intravitreal VEGF-A , ; b ) limit ability penetrate tissue full antibody ( vs. Lucentis , antibody fragment specifically design well tissue penetration ) , likely restore VEGF homeostasis within develop retina . There nearly identical multi-site trial ( NCT00702819 ) currently recruit , Childrens Hospital Los Angeles part . However , study limit enrollment criterion ; compassionate-use study create provide access bevacizumab ( Avastin ) high-risk infant qualify study NCT00702819 .</detailed_description>
