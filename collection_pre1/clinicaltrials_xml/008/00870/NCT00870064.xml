	<detailed_description>Fractures bone expose outside world associate skin injury , know open fracture , frequently encounter orthopaedics . Traditionally , treatment call formal , operative treatment bone expose , foreign tissue debrided wound irrigate . The bone , depend age patient , fracture location stability treat appropriate method cast internal fixation . However , current standard care open fracture , open fracture differ term bone involve , energy cause injury skeletal maturity patient . Children , example , thick periosteum may diminish rate infection decrease time heal . In addition , protocol operative debridement introduce time widespread antibiotic use . It know whether mechanical operative management antibiotic use result improved outcome . In retrospective study , center report emergency department management alone may result equal result without time expense operative theater . We propose prospective , randomized trial child type I open fracture evaluate whether formal operative treatment necessary . Our hypothesis minor open fracture child safely treat emergency room irrigation , close reduction home antibiotic without increase risk infection complication . If inclusion criterion meet informed consent obtain , child randomize two treatment arm - formal operative management ( OR ) emergency department ( ED ) management . Children randomize OR arm take OR within 24 hour irrigation debridement appropriate bone management . Children ED arm washout emergency room conscious sedation , close reduction home antibiotic . Both wound examine interval follow period sign infection . Outcomes evaluated include rate infection , number return visit operate room , time bone healing , complication . This pilot study plan eventually multicenter study evaluate open fracture care child .</detailed_description>
