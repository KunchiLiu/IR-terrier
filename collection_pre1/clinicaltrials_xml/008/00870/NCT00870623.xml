	<brief_summary>Bloodstream infection ( BSI ) major cause morbidity mortality . Community-onset BSI overall attributable mortality 10-13 % nosocomial BSI mortality range quite variable 12-80 % . Bloodstream infection also costly result prolong hospital stay . Nosocomial BSIs show increase length stay 5-25 day increase cost $ 23,000 - 40,000 matched control . The duration therapy necessary clear blood stream infection unknown study systematically address issue . The use antimicrobial also without consequence . These include financial cost , side-effects , promotion superinfection ( especially Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea ) , promotion microbial resistance . We hypothesize procalcitonin ( host biomarker ) endotoxin ( microorganism biomarker ) -guided treatment plan could significantly decrease unnecessary exposure antibiotic patient bloodstream infection .</brief_summary>
