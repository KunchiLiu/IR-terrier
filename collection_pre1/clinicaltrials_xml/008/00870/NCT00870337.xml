	<brief_title>Everolimus Treating Patients With Relapsed Metastatic Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Estimate rate non-progression 3 month treatment everolimus patient relapse metastatic endometrial cancer . Secondary - Evaluate partial complete response rate 3 month treatment everolimus patient . - Evaluate duration response patient . - Evaluate clinical benefit 6 month treatment everolimus patient . - Evaluate time progression patient . - Evaluate progression-free overall survival patient . - Evaluate nature , frequency , severity side effect everolimus patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral everolimus daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 3 month every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
