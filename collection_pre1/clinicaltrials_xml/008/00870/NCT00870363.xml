	<brief_summary>This research study do find immune system small intestine improves take antiretroviral ( anti-HIV ) medication . Biopsies ( small snip tissue ) take part intestines stomach , study laboratory . The main purpose study measure increase number immune cell intestine see number related amount medication reach intestinal tissue , amount virus still hide . Subjects either normal control subject without HIV , HIV positive start HIV medication . As part study , HIV positive patient randomize receive one three possible combination medication . 1. maraviroc ( Selzentry ) combination 2 NRTIs ( dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ) 2. maraviroc PLUS raltegravir combination 2 NRTIs ( dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ) 3. efavirenz ( Sustiva ) combination 2 NRTIs ( dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ) Both Maraviroc Raltegravir represent new class medication way interfere HIV make copy . Maraviroc attach surface T-cell virus use get cell therefore known entry inhibitor . Raltegravir block virus insert DNA infect cell 's nucleus therefore known Integrase Inhibitor . We hope learn antiretroviral drug affect T cell immune function restores HIV infection treat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Project Virologic , Pharmacologic Immunologic Correlates Gastrointestinal-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Immune Reconstitution Following Maraviroc Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improved survival , durable virologic suppression , increase peripheral CD4+ T-cell count patient receive potent antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) , immune reconstitution remain incomplete measure number additional surrogate marker . Perhaps critically important among area apparent incomplete immune recovery gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) , CD4+ T-cells repopulate slowly . Several new class antiretrovirals ( ART ) recently approve FDA offer potential advantage term immune reconstitution and/or kinetics viral suppression traditionally available treatment regimen . Maraviroc new ART agent novel class HIV inhibitor , entry inhibitor , result rapid suppression HIV recovery peripheral CD4+ T-cells . This project propose examine whether volunteer receive maraviroc recover GALT immune cell completely take comparator ART . Raltegravir integrase inhibitor block incorporation proviral HIV DNA host chromosome lead rapid decline plasma HIV load previously observe . This project propose examine whether volunteer receive maraviroc maraviroc plus raltegravir recover GALT immune cell completely take comparator ART . An additional attraction use maraviroc raltegravir together may provide potent combination also lipid neutral thereby constitute 'Heart friendly HAART ' ( Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ) .</detailed_description>
