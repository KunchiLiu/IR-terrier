	<brief_summary>The investigator intend perform large prospective study look predictability random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio compare gold standard 24-hour urine protein collection . Furthermore , investigator plan investigate whether analysis proteinuria short time interval ( 4 8 hour ) within overall 24-hour collection period predictive 24-hour sample . Lastly , investigator plan determine whether combination random test shorter collection interval comparable 24-hour collection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicitve Use Spot Urine Protein/Creatinine Ratios Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia affect approximately 5-8 % pregnancy United States approximately 10 % occur 34 week gestation . The diagnosis preeclampsia determine presence hypertension proteinuria 20 week gestation . The gold standard measure proteinuria 24-h urine collection total protein . In non-pregnant patient , random urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio show reliable indicator significant proteinuria . The reliability test remain unclear pregnant population . Because relatively study pregnant population many study poorly design , limited sample size , confound variable , research area still necessary . The purpose study determine alternative diagnostic tool quantification total protein excretion 24-hours aid diagnosis preeclampsia perform quickly efficiently gold standard 24-hour urine collection . We intend perform large prospective study look predictability random urine protein-to-creatinine ratio compare gold standard 24-h urine protein collection . Furthermore , plan investigate whether analysis proteinuria short time interval ( 4 8 hour ) within overall 24-h collection period predictive 24-h sample . Lastly , plan determine whether combination random test shorter collection interval comparable 24-h collection . The goal would make diagnosis preeclampsia timely fashion aid prevention maternal neonatal morbidity mortality include eclampsia , HELLP syndrome , acute renal failure , pulmonary edema , DIC , IUGR , IUFD , intracranial bleeding stroke , Additionally , early diagnosis could also impact patient care reduce hospital stay , nurse demand , eliminate need cumbersome likely inaccurate patient 24-h home collection .</detailed_description>
