	<brief_title>Jugular Venous Oxygen Saturation During Therapeutic Hypothermia After Cardiac Arrest</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Latest international guideline recommend use therapeutic hypothermia patient cardiac arrest remain coma return spontaneous circulation . This recommend essentially limit cerebral injury cause cardiac arrest possibly amplify upon reperfusion . At time , although spontaneous circulation return , cerebral oxygenation may remain inadequate due inadequate perfusion pressure , hypothermia , reduce cardiac output cerebral blood flow could actually aggravate phenomenon . The rewarming period think great risk inadequate oxygenation increase metabolic demand . With study aim understand happen cerebral oxygenation metabolism therapeutic hypothermia cardiac arrest cerebrovenous oxygen saturation monitoring particular , see whether type monitoring could recognize otherwise unnoticed period inadequate cerebral oxygenation .</detailed_description>
