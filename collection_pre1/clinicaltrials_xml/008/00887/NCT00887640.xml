	<brief_summary>This single arm study 11 men treatment refractory metastatic Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC ) receive temsirolimus IV dose 25 mg weekly progression . Progression include Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) progression ; however , upon PSA progression , addition anti-androgen permit . The primary objective study evaluate change circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) count time men metastatic treatment-refractory CRPC response temsirolimus therapy .</brief_summary>
