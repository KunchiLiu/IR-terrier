	<brief_summary>Background : - Urticaria common itchy skin disorder may occur spontaneously exposure physical trigger ( call physical urticaria ) . - Researchers study genetic basis physically induced urticarial syndrome . Once call familial cold urticaria , condition call familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome ( FCAS ) . FCAS autoinflammatory disease , group inherit disorder characterize unprovoked episode inflammation . Patients FCAS often hive , joint pain , fever follow general exposure cold . - Patients FCAS mutation gene make protein call cryopyrin . Cryopyrin seem involve production proinflammatory mediator call interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) . Patients FCAS others autoinflammatory syndromes benefited medication block effect IL-1 . Objectives : - To investigate mechanism may cause physical hive urticaria . - To reproduce urticaria challenge test ( procedure test skin reaction stimulus ) , follow mast cell study , measurement IL-1 , genetic study , molecular study lead good understanding urticaria design safe effective treatment . Eligibility : - Patients 6 month 65 year age document history clinically reproducible physical urticaria trigger hive evaluate physician . Patients letter referral , include copy pertinent medical history laboratory study , refer physician . - Affected nonaffected family member patient . - Exclusion criterion include ( 1 ) presence condition may put subject undue risk , acute infection , severe thrombocytopenia ( low normal number platelet blood ) , significant cardiovascular disease ; ( 2 ) condition would make subject unsuitable enrollment study ; ( 3 ) history HIV , know immunodeficiency , evidence chronic Hepatitis B and/or C infection . Design : - Researchers conduct follow test verify trigger cause hive : - History physical exam determine relationship trigger appearance hive . - Blood sample baseline screen ( additional sample may take within 8 hour trigger hive ) . - Verification hive use standard challenge test . - Procedures trigger urticaria ( challenge test ) include dermatographism ( stroke skin ) , delayed pressure urticaria ( direct pressure ) , cold-induced urticaria ( cold exposure ) , cholinergic urticaria ( exercise , hot water ) , solar urticaria ( sun exposure ) , localize heat urticaria ( direct heat exposure ) , aquagenic urticaria ( room temperature water ) , vibratory angioedema ( direct vibratory stimulus exposure ) . - Participants positive history hive fail challenge testing ( , hive result trigger ) ask provide skin biopsy additional blood sample research purpose . - Participants ask return clinic within 1 month multiple trigger could verify initial visit , return additional research evaluation , may include skin punch biopsy blood sample collection . Patients may stay hospital overnight , required document disease . - Nonaffected family member enroll protocol provide sample comparison family member history hive . - Participants receive small financial compensation skin biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Urticaria common skin disorder classify accord chronicity acute chronic form . It may occur spontaneously exposure physical factor . In latter case , urticaria classify physical urticaria . Physical urticaria may induce mechanical applied pressure , exercise , exposure cold , heat , sun , water , vibration . The urticarial lesion generally think result mast cell activation degranulation , support find increased level serum histamine urticarial flare . Passive transfer experiment , whereupon serum affect donor transfer recipient skin follow physical stimulation resultant urticaria site challenge , positive instance . This suggest presence intrinsic factor serum , IgE , mediate activation tissue mast cell . However , pathogenesis general remain unclear genetic basis disorder elucidate . The goal protocol thus gain good understand pathogenesis physical urticaria investigation subject severe unusual phenotype and/or inherit pattern disease . Subjects undergo clinical evaluation include verification urticaria . Blood tissue sample , available , collected analysis . The analysis target toward determination novel serum mediator , mast cell activation mutational analysis family inherit pattern .</detailed_description>
