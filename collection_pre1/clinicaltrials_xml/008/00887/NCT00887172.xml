Neither Chinese medicine practitioner , recruit doctor , patient know whether subject take CHM placebo . 328 subject ( 164 diagnosis group ) recruit patient consult Ap Lei Chau Government General Outpatient clinic URTIs . Each subject require return clinic follow-up assessment Chinese medicine practitioner day 7 post-treatment subject contact telephone Day 2 , 3 , 5 , 9 , 11 , 13,15 20 treatment ass symptom find developed side effect adverse reaction . The main outcome measure difference proportion subject resolution URTI Day 7 treatment placebo group . The secondary outcome measure reduction duration severity symptom , quality life illness side effect .
