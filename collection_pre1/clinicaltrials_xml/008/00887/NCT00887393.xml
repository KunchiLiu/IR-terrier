	<brief_summary>Nonalcoholic Liver disease ( NAFLD ) know caused deposition fat liver . The impact NAFLD bariatric surgery great concern . Enlarged fatty liver increase operative complication bariatric surgery weight loss prior bariatric surgery show reduce complication surgery . Most bariatric surgery program use conventional low fat , calorie restrict diet preparation phase surgery . The investigator compare effect low carbohydrate versus low fat diet weight loss , reduction liver fat content , liver size . These result provide new clinical insight optimal dietary intervention make bariatric surgery safe effective increase number patient opt aggressive therapy morbid obesity . Patients approve bariatric surgery University Michigan Bariatric Surgery multidisciplinary committee randomly assign either 1000 1200 calorie low fat low carbohydrate , 8-week study diet . All food study provide free study team . Participants require meet study team weekly pick study food nutritional consult . These visit occur eight week precede patient 's bariatric surgery procedure . During bariatric surgery , liver biopsy perform assess impact study diet liver fat content .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Macrocomposition Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) Bariatric Surgery Candidates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The obesity epidemic lead increase morbidity morality cardiovascular disease Type 2 diabetes . One co-morbidity obesity nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) , characterize excess fat deposition liver . About third overweight obese population NAFLD rise 80 90 % morbidity obese patient . Short-term weight loss caloric restriction lead reduction hepatic fat content , suggest ability liver quickly respond dietary intervention . Manipulation diet macronutrient composition order achieve quicker weight loss well improve adverse metabolic consequence attributable excess weight attract much attention controversy . Multiple clinical study show low carbohydrate diet provide rapid weight loss individual short-term trouble adhere diet 6 month . Most bariatric surgery program use conventional low fat , calorie restrict diet preparation phase surgery . However , systematic comparison diet different macronutrient composition perform . In study propose compare clinical effect low carbohydrate versus low fat diet individual derive immediate benefit intervention potential reduce hepatic fat content : individual prepare bariatric surgery ( laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding ) . Enlarged steatotic liver increase operative risk bariatric surgery weight loss prior bariatric surgery show reduce operative risk . We hypothesize use 1000 1200 kcalorie low carbohydrate diet ( &lt; 15 % total kcaloric intake ) preparation phase bariatric surgery cause great reduction weight , hepatic fat content hepatic volume compare `` conventional '' 1000 1200 kcalorie low-fat diet ( 30 % fat , 60 % carbohydrate total kcaloric intake ) offer clinical advantage make technical aspect surgery easier . Thus , data collect provide significant new clinical insight effect diet different macronutrient composition . These result provide basis large clinical trial identify optimal dietary intervention make bariatric surgery safe effective increase number patient opt aggressive therapy morbid obesity .</detailed_description>
