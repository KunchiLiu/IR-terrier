	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Concomitant Adjuvant Temozolomide Versus Radiation Therapy With Adjuvant PCV Chemotherapy Patients With Anaplastic Glioma Low Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize phase III patient newly diagnose co-deleted 1p/19q anaplastic glioma high risk low grade glioma . The trial enroll patient 1p/19q co-deletion . This study include two arm describe `` Arms '' section . A dynamic allocation procedure use allocate equal number patient different arm ( Arms A : B = 1:1 ) . This procedure balance marginal distribution stratification factor among arm . The stratification factor use cooperative group ( EORTC vs. North American group ) , age ( ≤ 50 vs. &gt; 50 ) , performance score ( ECOG 0-1 vs. 2 ) , tumor grade ( anaplastic glioma vs. low grade glioma ) . The primary goal determine whether patient receive radiotherapy concomitant temozolomide ( TMZ ) follow adjuvant temozolomide ( RT + TMZ -- &gt; TMZ ) ( Arm B ) marginally good progression free survival ( PFS ) compare patient receive radiotherapy follow PCV chemotherapy ( RT -- &gt; PCV ) ( Arm A ) . Secondary Goals : 1 . Time Progression - To determine whether patient receive ( RT + TMZ -- &gt; TMZ ) significantly long time progression ( clinical radiographic progression ) compare patient receive radiotherapy follow adjuvant PCV chemotherapy ( RT -- &gt; PCV ) . 2 . Correlation exploratory biomarkers survival - To determine whether difference survival base ( 1 ; 19 ) ( q10 , p10 ) translocation status MGMT promoter hypermethylation status . 3 . Descriptive Comparisons Additional Secondary Endpoints - To perform descriptive comparison additional secondary outcome endpoint , include overall survival , objective tumor response , prognostic factor analysis quality life . 4 . Toxicity - To determine toxicity treatment arm perform descriptive comparison . 5 . Neurocognitive Quality Life ( QOL ) Effects - To determine neurocognitive QOL effect patient treat protocol correlate result outcome endpoint . 6 . Banking Biospecimens Neuroimaging Studies - To store blood product ( i.e. , plasma , DNA buffy coat ) , tumor tissue MRI/CT image future scientific investigation . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 1 year , every 4 month 2 year every 6 month progressive disease end study participation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PreRegistration Central Pathology Review Submission : This review mandatory prior registration confirm eligibility . Patients must willing submit tissue sample mandatory central pathology review submission deletion status determination . It initiate soon surgery possible . Registration 1 . Age ≥ 18 year 2 . Newly diagnose ≤ 3 month surgical diagnosis 3 . Histological confirmation anaplastic glioma ( oligodendroglioma , mixed , astrocytoma [ WHO grade 2 3 ] low grade glioma [ WHO grade 2 ] , determine preregistration central pathology review . Note : Mixed glioma eligible , regardless degree astrocytic oligodendrocytic predominance , long tumor also codeleted 1p 19q . 4 . Patients codeleted low grade glioma must also consider `` high risk '' clinical criterion utilize RTOG 9802 must either : age ≥ 40 surgical therapy age &lt; 40 subtotal resection biopsy . 5 . Tumor tissue must show codeletion relevant portion chromosomes 1p 19q FISH analysis , define test laboratory . 6 . Surgery ( partial gross total resection biopsy ) must perform ≥ 2 week prior registration . Patient must recover effect surgery . 7 . The following laboratory value obtain ≤ 21 day prior registration . 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm^3 2 . Platelet ( PLTs ) count ≥ 100,000/mm^3 3 . Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; 9.0g/dL 4 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) 5 . Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≤ 3 x ULN 6 . Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN 8 . Negative serum urine pregnancy test do ≤ 7 day prior registration woman childbearing potential . 9 . Willing able complete neurocognitive test without assistance Quality Life ( QOL ) questionnaires without assistance 10 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 11 . Provide informed write consent . 12 . Willing return enrol institution followup Active Monitoring Phase ( ie , active treatment observation portion ) study 13 . Mandatory Tissue Samples Correlative Research Patient willing provide tissue sample correlative research purpose Registration 1 . Fetal/Newborn Toxicity : Any follow study involve agent know genotoxic , mutagenic teratogenic effect : Pregnant woman , nurse woman , men woman childbearing potential unwilling employ adequate contraception study 6 month follow completion temozolomide treatment . 2 . Received prior surgery , radiation therapy chemotherapy central nervous system ( CNS ) neoplasm . Note : Patients prior low grade glioma without surgery anaplastic glioma prior radiation chemotherapy eligible study . 3 . Comorbid systemic illness severe concurrent disease , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate entry study interfere significantly proper assessment safety toxicity prescribe regimen . 4 . Concomitant serious immunocompromised status ( relate concomitant steroid ) would compromise safety patient study . 5 . Patients know Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) positive currently receive retroviral therapy . Note : Patients know HIV positive , without clinical evidence immunocompromised state , eligible study . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Receiving investigational agent would consider treatment primary neoplasm . 8 . Other active malignancy within 5 year registration . Exceptions : Nonmelanotic skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix . Note : If history prior malignancy , patient must receive specific treatment ( hormonal therapy ) cancer . 9 . History myocardial infarction ≤ 6 month , congestive heart failure require use ongoing maintenance therapy lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmia . 10 . Recent history hepatitis infection treat physician determine patient would significant risk reactivation hepatitis .</criteria>
