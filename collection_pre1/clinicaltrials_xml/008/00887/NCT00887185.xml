	<brief_title>Validation/Dissemination Of A Temporal Bone Dissection Simulator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research design test efficacy computer base virtual simulation teach ear surgery . Subjects randomize train usual fashion train simulation environment . Subjects performance test standard fashion dissect cadaveric temporal bone ( human ear ) training . The subject also perform dissection virtual environment training . The result tabulate compare different training arm . There minimal risk associate project limited exposure cadaveric material . Current training technique utilize cadaveric material exposure type material already part standard training process study constitute increase risk beyond encountered regular training . Demographic information obtain study subject age , sex , information regard previous otologic training , year training prior experience use computer . The anticipated benefit society future otologic surgeon obtain operative experience control non threaten environment . They access great number variation pathology . This allow novice surgeon obtain significantly experience outside operating room prior work live patient . This result less risk patient well trained ear surgeon .</detailed_description>
