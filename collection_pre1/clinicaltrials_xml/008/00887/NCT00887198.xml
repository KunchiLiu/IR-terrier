	<brief_title>Abiraterone Acetate Asymptomatic Mildly Symptomatic Patients With Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( individual assign chance study treatment ) , double-blind ( individual study personnel know identity study treatment ) , placebo ( inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) -controlled study approximately 1,000 medically surgically castrate male patient metastatic CRPC show tumor progression asymptomatic mildly symptomatic . The study period consist screening , treatment , follow-up phase . Patients receive study treatment ( abiraterone acetate placebo ) plus prednisone radiographic progression disease and/or unequivocal clinical progression . Efficacy evaluation perform throughout treatment period safety assess 30 day last dose abiraterone acetate . throughout study . Follow-up continue 60 month ( 5 year ) patient dy , lose follow-up , withdraws informed consent . At interim analysis overall survival ( OS ; 43 % death event ) , independent data monitoring committee ( IDMC ) review efficacy safety data conclude data point significant advantage patient one arm study compare arm thereby unanimously recommend unblinding study allow crossover placebo arm active therapy . Patients currently receive placebo offer crossover therapy abiraterone acetate . Treatment patient originally randomize abiraterone acetate treatment group change . Patients discontinue long term follow-up time Clinical Cut-Off Date Final Analysis ( CCO-FA ) ; however , patient still receive treatment abiraterone acetate CCO-FA offer receive continue treatment additional period 3 year disease progression unacceptable toxicity . For patient , safety assessment perform continue treatment , 30 day last dose abiraterone acetate .</detailed_description>
