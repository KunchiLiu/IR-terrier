	<brief_summary>The main purpose study learn add bevacizumab standard treatment chemotherapy ( docetaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide ) early stage HER2-negative breast cancer prevent breast cancer return . A second purpose study learn add bevacizumab treatment chemotherapy help woman HER2-negative breast cancer live longer . The researcher also want learn side effect combination drug use study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Comparing Combination TC Plus Bevacizumab TC Alone TAC Women With Node-Positive High-Risk Node-Negative , HER2-Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The B-46-I/07132 study , multicenter , open-label , randomized Phase III , adjuvant therapy trial , compare value add bevacizumab non-anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen relative chemotherapy without bevacizumab relative anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimen woman resect node-positive high-risk node-negative , HER2-negative breast cancer . This trial determine whether addition bevacizumab regimen docetaxel cyclophosphamide ( TCB ) improve invasive disease-free survival relative docetaxel cyclophosphamide alone ( TC ) . A secondary aim determine whether addition bevacizumab TC improve invasive disease-free survival compare regimen docetaxel , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide ( TAC ) . Other secondary aim include whether TCB improve disease-free survival , overall survival , recurrence-free interval relative TC alone TAC . The toxicity three regimen also compare . Patients B-46-I/07132 study randomize one three treatment regimen : Group 1 patient receive 6 cycle TAC administer every 21 day ( docetaxel 75 mg/m2 , doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 , cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m2 ) ; Group 2 patient receive 6 cycle TC administer every 21 day ( docetaxel 75 mg/m2 , cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 ) ; Group 3 patient receive 6 cycle TCB every 21 day bevacizumab therapy continue every 21 day completion chemotherapy 1 year follow first dose ( docetaxel 75 mg/m2 , cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 , bevacizumab 15 mg/kg ) . Primary prophylaxis pegfilgrastim filgrastim require Group 1 patient ( optional patient Groups 2 3 ) . Patients also receive adjuvant radiation therapy clinically indicated endocrine therapy hormone receptor-positive tumor . Tumor sample submit correlative science study evaluate predictor study therapy benefit . Submission tumor sample study requirement patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must female . The patient must great equal 18 year age less equal 70 year age . The patient must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . The tumor must unilateral invasive adenocarcinoma breast histologic examination . The breast cancer must HER2negative base current American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) /College American Pathologists ( CAP ) Guideline Recommendations Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 Testing Breast Cancer . If result situ hybridization test ( FISH , chromagen situ hybridization ( CISH ) , ) equivocal , patient eligible plan administer HER2targeted therapy . All follow stag criterion ( accord 6th edition American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) Cancer Staging Manual ) must meet : By pathologic evaluation , primary tumor must pT13 ; By pathologic evaluation , ipsilateral node must pN0 , pN1 ( pN1mi , pN1a , pN1b , pN1c ) , pN2a , pN3a , pN3b . If pN0 , least one follow criterion must meet : ER negative PgR negative ; Pathologic tumor size great 2.0 cm ; T1c ( pathologic tumor size great 1.0 cm less equal 2.0 cm ) ER positive ( PgR status may positive negative ) either Oncotype DXÂ® Recurrence Score great equal 25 grade 3 histology . Patients must undergo either total mastectomy breastconserving surgery ( lumpectomy ) . For patient undergo lumpectomy , margin resect specimen must histologically free invasive tumor DCIS determine local pathologist . If pathologic examination demonstrate tumor line resection , additional operative procedure must perform obtain clear margin . If tumor still present resect margin reexcision ( ) , patient must undergo total mastectomy eligible . ( Patients margin positive lobular carcinoma situ [ LCIS ] eligible without additional resection . ) For patient undergo mastectomy , margin must histologically free invasive tumor DCIS . Patients must complete one follow procedure evaluation pathologic nodal status : Sentinel lymphadenectomy alone pathologic nodal stag base sentinel lymphadenectomy pN0 , pN1mi , pN1b ; Sentinel lymphadenectomy follow removal additional nonsentinel lymph node sentinel node ( SN ) positive ; Axillary lymphadenectomy without SN isolation procedure . The interval last surgery breast cancer ( treatment stag ) randomization must least 28 day 84 day . Patients must ER analysis perform primary tumor prior randomization . If ER analysis negative , PgR analysis must also perform . ( Either core biopsy surgical resection specimen use ER/PgR test . ) The recent postoperative blood count must meet following criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must great equal 1200/mm3 ; platelet count must great equal 100,000/mm3 ; hemoglobin must great equal 10 g/dL .

Alkaline phosphatase aspartate transaminase ( AST ) may great ULN . For example , alkaline phosphatase great ULN less equal 2.5 x ULN , AST must less equal ULN .
