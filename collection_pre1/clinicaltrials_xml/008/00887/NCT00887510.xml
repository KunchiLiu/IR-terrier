	<brief_summary>High blood pressure , also refer hypertension , blood pressure level 140/90 mm Hg high . Along lifestyle change , various medication currently use treat people hypertension . Some medication , however , may affect way body handle sugar , essentially prevent body break sugar predispose people develop diabetes . People metabolic syndrome—a condition primarily characterize increased waist measurement , abnormal blood lipid level , hypertension , high blood sugar levels—are already risk develop diabetes . In people , take antihypertensive medication prevent sugar breakdown may increase risk diabetes . The purpose study gain understanding people metabolic syndrome respond antihypertensive medication alter body 's ability break sugar .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment hypertension include lifestyle change medication . Examples antihypertensive medication include diuretic , beta-blockers , angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) , vasodilator . Mounting research suggest certain antihypertensive medication , thiazide diuretic , associate metabolic disturbance result increase glucose intolerance , antihypertensive medication , ACE inhibitor ARBs , appear improve insulin sensitivity glucose metabolism . The influence medication may especially critical people metabolic syndrome , already risk develop glucose intolerance diabetes . The purpose study gain understanding people metabolic syndrome respond antihypertensive medication alter body 's ability break sugar . The long-term goal study determine best antihypertensive medication people metabolic syndrome hypertension prevent delay onset diabetes population . Participation study last 18 week involve four study visit . Participants randomly assign initially receive 6 week treatment either hydrochlorothiazide ( HCTZ ) , thiazide diuretic , trandolapril , ACE inhibitor . Both medication FDA-approved treat hypertension . After 6 week treatment , participant ' blood pressure level low , add second medication take HCTZ trandolapril next 6 week , Week 12 . At Week 12 , participant ' blood pressure level low , take second medication last 6 week . The four study visit occur baseline three 6-week treatment period ( Weeks 6 , 12 , 18 ) . All study visit include blood pressure pulse measurement , urine blood sampling , oral glucose tolerance testing , question diet exercise habit . The first last study visit also include physical examination medical history review . Some blood collect first study visit use genetic testing . There follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
