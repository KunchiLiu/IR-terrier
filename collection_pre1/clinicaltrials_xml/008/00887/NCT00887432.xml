	<brief_title>Cholecalciferol Supplement Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Observation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response oral high dose vitamin D3 supplementation ( cholecalciferol ) patient localize , histologically proven adenocarcinoma prostate receive treatment prostate cancer ever choose expectant management . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine pattern response PSA dynamic well absolute change PSA follow vitamin D3 supplementation . II . Assess toxicity vitamin D3 supplementation men prostate cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Track occurrence infection , deep venous thrombosis , vascular event fall study population . II . To evaluate relationship cytochrome P450 family 24 ( CYP24 ) , 27B1 , single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) serum 25 ( hydroxy [ OH ] ) vitamin D response oral D3 supplementation . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cholecalciferol orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 9 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After wash-out period 3 month , patient cross-over Arm II . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD 9 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After wash-out period 3 month , patient cross-over Arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
