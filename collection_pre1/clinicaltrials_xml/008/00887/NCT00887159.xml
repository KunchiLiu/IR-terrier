	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study cisplatin etoposide see well work give without Hedgehog inhibitor GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) IGF-1R MOAB IMC-A12 ( cixutumumab ) treat patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Etoposide may slow growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Vismodegib may slow growth tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , cixutumumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . It yet know whether give cisplatin etoposide effective give together vismodegib cixutumumab treat small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Phase II Study Cisplatin Etoposide Combination With Either Hedgehog Inhibitor GDC-0449 IGF-1R MOAB IMC-A12 Patients With Extensive Stage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer ( SCLC-ED ) treat cisplatin etoposide ( CE ) , CE hedgehog ( HH ) inhibitor GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) , CE insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor ( IGF-1R ) monoclonal antibody ( IMC-A12 ) ( cixutumumab ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate , overall survival , toxicity arm . II . To explore putative correlate clinical benefit combination therapy tumor circulate tumor cell patient treat protocol . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM A ( CE ) : Patients receive cisplatin ( 75 mg/m^2 ) intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour day 1 etoposide ( 100 mg/m^2 ) IV 1-2 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B ( CE +GDC-0449 ) : Patients receive cisplatin etoposide Arm A vismodegib ( GDC-0449 ; 150 mg tablet ) orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive vismodegib alone QD absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM C ( CE + IMC-A12 ) : Patients receive cisplatin etoposide Arm A cixutumumab ( IMC-A12 ; 6 mg/kg ) IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive cixutumumab alone weekly absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
