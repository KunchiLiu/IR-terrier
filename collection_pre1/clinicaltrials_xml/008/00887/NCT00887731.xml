	<brief_summary>Nearly forty year ago Berran coworkers test analog oxygen controller maintain incubator oxygen level infant suffer neonatal respiratory disease order prevent hyperoxia . There least three clinical issue technology address : first avoidance episodic hyperoxia ; second decreasing episodic hypoxia ; third lower cumulative oxygen exposure . Clinical trial use target SpO2 ranging probably help improve problem , far direct measurement continuous arterial oxygen level , clinical study establish degree improve control blood oxygen saturation decrease cumulative amount oxygen exposure . This study address later important step process incorporate closed-loop oxygen control technology routine standard neonatal respiratory care . OBJECTIVES : PART 1 : Test modify instruction set computerized oxygen controller achieve goal less six ( 6 ) operator require interruption per hour oxygen saturation deviation outside study guideline . PART 2 : Perform within patient cross-over trial computerize oxygen controller versus standard care ( patient 's care team adjust patient 's oxygen level ) evaluate area time curve oxygen exposure two control method . PART 3 : ( After successful completion PART 2 ) Continuation within patient cross-over study randomize cross-over sequence . Studies last 4 12 hour divide two ( 2 ) equal time block one cross-over either automatic manual control mode . Provision additional twenty ( 20 ) patient study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nearly forty year ago Berran coworkers test analog oxygen controller maintain incubator oxygen level infant suffer neonatal respiratory disease order prevent hyperoxia . 1 . The system able regulate within 1 % set inspired oxygen level result stable infant arterial oxygen level measure transcutaneously . Twenty year later , advent pulse oximetry computer technology , open loop control infant oxygen saturation study newborn use computer program incorporate fuzzy logic clinical algorithm . 2 . During computer-assisted inspired oxygen adjustment less variability pulse oximeter oxygen saturation level ( SpO2 ) patient spent time within target oxygen saturation range . The next technology step move open close loop control , do Claure et al 2001 . 3 . These investigator find closed loop control inspire oxygen least effective fully dedicate nurse maintain SpO2 within target range , may effective nurse work routine condition . Percent record time spent normoxia increase 66 % 75 % . Other bench research suggest close loop oxygen controller base SpO2 monitoring response time within 20 second able maintain SpO2 within three percent saturation . 4 . In clinical crossover trial show compare routine inspire oxygen control management bedside personnel , close loop control inspire oxygen concentration significantly increase time within target saturation range 82 % 91 % . 5 . The importance control oxygen exposure neonates long standing , especially relate retinopathy prematurity bronchopulmonary dysplasia . The prospect decreasing oxygen related morbidity still real ongoing topic process change direct overcome treatment barrier . 6 . Maintaining oxygen saturation tightly within appropriate treatment range appear improve short long term outcome , include developmental index . 7 . Given improvement oxygen exposure realize closed-loop control inspire oxygen concentration demonstrate , development commercial device incorporate technology highly desirable positive move toward uniform control oxygen exposure neonates . There least three clinical issue technology address : first avoidance episodic hyperoxia ; second decreasing episodic hypoxia ; third lower cumulative oxygen exposure .</detailed_description>
