	<brief_summary>The success combination antiretroviral therapy herald revolution treatment HIV mid-1990s . However , severe treatment-associated side effect observe include diabetes increase cholesterol link premature heart attack . This effect describe among many regimen contain protease inhibitor ( PIs ) , well non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) . Raltegravir new medicine show potent efficacious suppression HIV . This study hop determine switch PI NNRTI raltegravir decrease cholesterol subject high cholesterol well control HIV . In addition , study aim confirm raltegravir safe well tolerate . It also seek confirm raltegravir similar anti-HIV activity compare patient 's previous regimen . The study last 6 month involve 20 subject . HIV-1 infected men woman PIs NNRTIs least 12 month study entry well control HIV recruit . Hypotheses : 1 . Patients elevate lipid level combination antiretroviral therapy PIs NNRTIs experience improvement lipid level switch PI NNRTI raltegravir base regimen . 2 . Raltegravir safe well tolerate . 3 . Raltegravir similar antiretroviral activity compare prior regimen . Primary Objective : To demonstrate improvement lipid profile ( triglyceride LDL ) subject switched raltegravir PIs NNRTIs 2 , 3 , 6 month study entry . Study Design : Subjects give option switch current regimen raltegravir 400mg twice daily . Those consent , receive raltegravir provide study 6 month . At entry , subject undergo complete physical exam thereafter target exams visit . Labs drawn part clinical care 2 , 3 , 6 month . Some blood store later analysis . Also , subject answer regular survey drug toxicity quality life . Their cholesterol level compare study . At end study , participant may choose continue raltegravir desire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The success combination antiretroviral therapy herald revolution management patient HIV mid-1990s . Increasingly , severe treatment-associated metabolic side effect observe linked premature coronary artery disease . This effect describe among many regimen contain protease inhibitor ( PIs ) well non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTIs ) . Raltegravir novel HIV-1 integrase inhibitor comparison study efavirenz show potent efficacious suppression HIV-1 . Minimal side effect report mainly include nausea , headache , dizziness , diarrhea , insomnia . Hypotheses : 1 . Patients elevate lipid level combination antiretroviral therapy PIs NNRTIs experience improvement lipid level switch PI NNRTI raltegravir base regimen . 2 . Raltegravir safe well tolerate . 3 . Raltegravir similar antiretroviral activity compare prior regimen . Primary Objective : To demonstrate improvement triglyceride LDL subject switch raltegravir PIs NNRTIs 2 month , 3 month , 6 month study entry . Secondary Objectives : To assess immunologic virologic outcome subject switch raltegravir PIs NNRTIs 2 , 3 , 6 month entry . Study Design : This single arm study subject give option switch current regimen raltegravir 400mg twice daily . Primary endpoint : Change baseline LDL change baseline triglycerides 3 month , adjust BMI smoke status . The subject ' plasma viral load switch compare paired test time point . The subject ' CD4+ T cell count compare paired test switching .</detailed_description>
