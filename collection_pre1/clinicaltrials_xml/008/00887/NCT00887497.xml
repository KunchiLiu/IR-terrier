	<brief_summary>One major complication surgical excision colorectal cancer include improper heal anastomosis ( reconnection remain , cancer free intestine ) . This result anastomotic leak , abscess abdominal and/or pelvic sepsis mortality . Esophageal surgery suffered complication . Recently , innovation esophageal surgery see relatively drastic decrease complication distal esophagectomies use technique call `` ischemic conditioning '' . This technique involve divide blood supply stomach would perform 1-stage esophagectomy return day later complete resection . Bench result show improved angiogenesis , vasodilation , less anastomotic collagen deposition minimize ischemia time surgery clinical result include improved stricture rate , leak rate mortality esophageal surgery . Hypothesis Ischemic conditioning universal intestinal tract similar technique apply colon rectal surgery . The investigator plan evaluate hypothesis perform pilot study comprise follow : perform endovascular embolization inferior mesenteric artery ( IMA ) follow interval laparoscopic open rectosigmoid resection . Methods Part 1 - Endovascular Procedure Patients admit undergo endovascular embolization IMA outpatient follow diagnostic angiography . They undergo sigmoidoscopy throughout embolization laser probe indirectly measure tissue oxygenation . The patient release home day . Part 2 - Colorectal Procedure Patients return 2-4 day later definitive laparoscopic open rectosigmoid resection . They undergo sigmoidoscopy surgery laser probe indirectly measure tissue oxygenation . The patient release home average 3-5 day later .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design evaluate safety feasibility ischemic conditioning colon prior resection . Colon rectal resection require removal section colon rectum re-attachment ( anastomosis ) two end . This join together intestine risk leak heal occur appropriately . Factors postulate lead anastomotic leak include ischemia well tension infection among others . The concept ischemic conditioning base upon innate ability compensate increase blood flow section intestine locally ischemic . By induce ischemia segment intestine prior resection , one could theoretically increase blood flow via collateral vessel prior resection . This would , turn , lead initial blood flow anastomosis time surgery via collateral , thereby decrease ischemia new , healing anastomosis . Ischemic condition first describe animal model prove safety efficacy . In rat model , ischemic conditioning demonstrate return baseline tissue perfusion time resection , improve anastomotic leak rate higher anastomotic wound break strength . The first time idea implement human model study Akiyama et . al . preoperative embolization show safe improve blood supply distal end anastomosis esophagectomy ( remain stomach ) . Further basic science study show improved angiogenesis , vasodilation , less anastomotic collagen deposition minimize ischemic injury . Further clinical study demonstrate improved stricture rate ( 0 % 40 % ) , leak rate ( 0-6 % 5-15 % ) mortality ( 0 % 5-10 % ) . One major complication colon rectal surgery improper heal anastomosis ( connection remain , cancer free rectum remain colon ) . This result anastomotic leak dehiscence lead abscess , abdominal sepsis require long hospital stay , IV antibiotic , reoperation possibly even death . It also lead late complication stricture impair function often require repeat dilation operative revision . Recent review show rate anastomotic complication upper rectal resection 8-17 % leak , average hospital stay 10 day . In current study , preoperative embolization Inferior Mesenteric Artery ( IMA ) perform patient schedule undergo colon rectal resection . The surgery perform standard fashion ( either laparoscopically open ) several day later ( 1-5 day ) . The study design prospective , non-randomized , safety ( pilot ) study . Since report perform exact procedure , feel necessary initially proceed safety study without comparative arm prior large scale , multicenter trial evaluate outcome . Therefore , study evaluate morbidity mortality outcomes statistical significance .</detailed_description>
