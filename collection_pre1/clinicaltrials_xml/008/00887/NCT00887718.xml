	<criteria>Group A : Newly Diagnosed Patients &gt; 18 year age . Confirmed diagnosis HL NHL ( histology ) . Any Ann Arbor stage . Pretreatment stag include CT head neck , chest , abdomen pelvis , minimum one equivocal finding scan , affect assignment stage IPI factor ( i.e . stage III/IV vs. stage I/II , question extranodal involvement disease ) . Group B : Response Assessment Patients &gt; 18 year age . Confirmed diagnosis HL NHL ( histology ) . Any Ann Arbor stage . Pretreatment stag include CT neck , chest , abdomen pelvis . If alternate assessment neck do clinical palpitation , ultrasound , MRI negative , CT neck mandatory . Posttreatment stag include CT head neck , chest , abdomen pelvis , 1 6 week posttherapy . Treated anthracyclinebased chemotherapy , without radiation therapy ( base stage disease ) . For Stage III/IV patient , PET do follow completion primary chemotherapy . For stage I/II patient , PET do combine modality therapy , chemotherapy alone primary intention therapy . Patients residual mass CT follow primary chemotherapy either `` unconfirmed '' CR ( &gt; 75 % decrease size ) PR ( Â³50 % decrease size ) , base International workshop criterion . Response Assessment None Curative treatment Intent After initial therapy response status : complete response , stable disease , progressive disease</criteria>
