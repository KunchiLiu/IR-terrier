	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate evolution walk capacity measure time 100-meter walk test ( T100T ) , time 25-foot walk test ( T25FW ) , maximum walk distance ( MWD ) , Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) first year therapy natalizumab . The secondary objective study follow : - To evaluate correlation MWD EDSS walk test , T100T T25FW Baseline , Week 24 Week 48 therapy . - To determine well walk test , T100T T25FW , predict walk limitation participant subgroups participant stratify baseline EDSS .</brief_summary>
