	<brief_summary>The purpose evaluation validate previous clinical study result use Near-Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) device , compare conventional urodynamics ( UDS ) test . The experiment use commercially available Tetra-NIRS Laborie UDS equipment . The hypothesis Tetra-NIRS device , clinical environment , provide data enhance analysis use standard urodynamics equipment ( stand-alone Urodynamic procedure ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tetra-NIRS Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study commercially available Tetra-NIRS device compare result collect conventional urodynamics . The study evaluate male patient low urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) well female subject over-active bladder ( OAB ) . The Tetra-NIRS unit use near infrared light 3 different wavelength measure change haemoglobin cytochrome detrusor muscle human bladder wall . This process similar use cerebral muscle oxygenation monitoring ( e.g. , pulse oximetry ) . Previous clinical feasibility study identify correlation change haemoglobin cytochrome bladder , bladder pressure value obtain urodynamics procedure uroflow procedure . For study Tetra-NIRS result use urologist/nurse guide patient management treatment decision , rather use collect measurement patient purpose study . The Tetra-NIRS sensor patch adhere externally skin surface bladder locate . For study , minimum 30 male subject LUTS 30 female subject OAB schedule undergo urodynamics procedure enrol . Up 20 female subject OAB enrol . The investigator attempt equally enrol male subject two category include obstructed non-obstructed group accord prostate hyperplasia ( equivocal subject determine investigator ) .</detailed_description>
