	<detailed_description>long-term oxygen therapy prolongs life patient severe COPD severe rest hypoxemia . The objective study measure survival relation level initial rest hypoxemia , serious co-morbidities , nutritional status COPD patient treat long-term oxygen therapy . After enrollment begin oxygen therapy , follow data collect 3 year . Lung function , blood gas analysis , exercise capacity measure 6-Min Walk Distance test ( 6-MWD ) , dyspnea scale , BODE index , quality life , indirect direct cost analyze every year .</detailed_description>
