	<brief_summary>In orthodontics , conventional fixed appliance , usually consist prefabricated component , require step-by-step adjustment order move teeth plan direction . May treatment improve customized archwires ? Study hypotheses : - By use CAD/CAM plan fabrication customize archwires , unnecessary tooth movement avoid teeth move direct path intend position . - The application CAD/CAM improve reproducibility , efficiency , quality orthodontic treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In orthodontics , conventional fixed appliance , usually consist prefabricated component , require step-by-step adjustment order move teeth plan direction . At moment tool , allow predict treatment result . Using conventional orthodontic treatment method orthodontist approach final result use trial-and-error-method , bend wire appointment , patient orthodontist satisfy . Usually general treatment plan , detailed treatment plan tooth movement . This lead long treatment time cause cost . Besides probability side effect ( caries root resorption ) increase duration treatment . In case choose technology call SureSmile ( R ) ( OraMetrix ) . SureSmile allow collection 3D-data intraorally plaster model , give possibility computer aid treatment planing ( Computer Aided Design ) manufacturing customize archwires ( Computer Aided Manufacturing ) . This new technology promise reduce time effort orthodontic treatment provide predictability quality also minimize negative side effect . This technology could - use diagnostic 3D-system - help understand orthodontic movement basic principle remodel periodontium improve orthodontic mechanic .</detailed_description>
