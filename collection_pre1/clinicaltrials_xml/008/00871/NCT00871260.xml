	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease major cause morbidity mortality United States . Currently , presence physiologically significant coronary disease commonly diagnose use non-invasive imaging test nuclear stress test echo stress test . Unfortunately , nuclear stress test require use ionizing radiation limit spatial resolution . On hand , echo stress test dependent adequate imaging window . Adenosine stress test combine cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) rapidly evolve technique diagnose significant coronary disease . It use ionize radiation excellent image quality . In recent meta-analysis 14 study total 1,183 patient , sensitivity specificity stress CMR detecting significant coronary disease 91 % 81 % . Additionally , 2 study show patient normal stress CMR study &lt; 1 % risk cardiovascular event ensue year . Another important advantage stress CMR ability fully quantify myocardial blood flow may improve diagnostic accuracy stress CMR . In addition perfusion imaging , CMR directly visualize coronary artery , detect extremely small myocardial infarction , precisely measure leave ventricular function . Although adenosine stress CMR rapidly mature test , several important challenge exist . First , many patient find difficult tolerate common side effect adenosine confine space MRI scanner . Secondly , many patient influence adenosine side effect adequately hold breath image acquisition make image interpretation difficult quantitative analysis time consume . Finally , adenosine must continuously infuse contrast-enhanced stress CMR , 2 separate intravenous ( I.V . ) catheter need . Most undesirable effect adenosine mediate adenosine A ( 2B ) A ( 3 ) receptor ; , desire vasodilator effect mediate A ( 2A ) receptor . The FDA recently approve adenosine A ( 2A ) receptor specific stress test agent call regadenoson administer 10 second bolus improved side effect safety profile compare adenosine . With improved tolerability ease use , regadenoson ideal stress test agent use CMR . The purpose study determine whether comprehensive regadenoson stress cardiac magnetic resonance study include myocardial perfusion imaging , optimize coronary imaging , myocardial scar image provide incremental prognostic information clinical evaluation include nuclear stress testing .</detailed_description>
