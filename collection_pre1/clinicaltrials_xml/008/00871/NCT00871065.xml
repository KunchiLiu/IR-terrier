	<brief_summary>Rupture cerebral aneurysm serious medical condition may result permanent disability even death related aneurysm rupture . Patients undergo successful surgical treatment aneurysm rarely experience problem relate specific aneurysm future . However , blood surface brain initial aneurysm rupture irritate blood vessel come contact . When blood vessel become irritated , spasm become narrower . This narrowing restrict blood flow vessel , severe result stroke cause inadequate blood flow vessel . Depending location severity , condition vessel spasm ( cerebral vasospasm ) may result permanent disability death . Treatment prevent cerebral vasospasm decrease risk stroke . This research try see medication FDA approve treatment lung disease sexual dysfunction use prevent and/or treat cerebral vasospasm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>When cerebral aneurysm rupture , surface brain blood vessel cover clot blood . This condition call subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) . Subarachnoid hemorrhage secondary rupture cerebral aneurysm medical condition associate high morbidity mortality ; approximately 10-15 % patient die reach medical care , overall mortality approximately 45 % . Of survive , 30 % suffer permanent disability grade moderate severe , two-thirds survivor never return quality life prior hemorrhage . A large number patient ( 30-70 % ) able make hospital successful treatment aneurysm develop delayed cerebral vasospasm relate blood clot initial aneurysm rupture . Of patient survive initial aneurysm rupture , vasospasm result additional 7 % mortality another 7 % severe disability secondary ischemic stroke severe spasm cerebral artery . The pathogenesis cerebral vasospasm topic significant research . The occurrence severity directly related volume hemorrhage thickness blood clot encase artery . Arterial vasospasm impair vasodilation delay process gradual onset , typically start earlier 3 day post-hemorrhage clinically resolve within 12 day initial aneurysm rupture . Breakdown clot subarachnoid blood impairs normal vasodilator constrictor mechanisms cerebral artery alter level several molecule include nitric oxide ( NO ) , vasodilator . Nitric oxide normally produce vascular endothelial cell lead vasodilation stimulate enzyme soluble guanylate cyclase . This enzyme catalyze production cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) , responsible vasodilation direct indirect action . Selective deactivation cGMP accomplish enzyme phosphodiesterase subtype V ( PDE-V ) . Studies reveal elevated level PDE-V diminish level cGMP animal experimentally induce SAH , level nitric oxide synthase remain stable hemorrhage . This prior research point toward SAH cause enhancement PDE-V activity , subsequently decrease cGMP level impair normal vasodilation . Papaverine , nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitor , beneficial selectively used treatment active vasospasm . Its use limit short duration action , nonspecific nature result systemic vasodilation subsequent hypotension . Sildenafil citrate , selective PDE-V inhibitor , show enhance reactivity cerebral vasculature normal healthy adult show decrease severity vasospasm animal experimentally induce SAH . These effect note minimal effect systemic hemodynamics . Given sildenafil citrate safely demonstrate expected clinical effect cerebral arterial dilation normal healthy human well animal without induced SAH , aim study determine medicine show efficacy human SAH secondary rupture aneurysm .</detailed_description>
