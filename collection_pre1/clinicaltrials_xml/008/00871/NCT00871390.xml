	<detailed_description>Experiments animal heart demonstrate case atrial fibrillation ( AF ) may maintain small number driver form self-sustained , reentrant , electrical impulse locate posterior left atrium ( LA ) wall , near pulmonary vein ( PV/LA junction ) . In experiment , fast rotor act high frequency driver maintain overall activity . This result hierarchy local excitation frequency throughout atrium . More recently , clinical study confirm existence hierarchical organization rate activation different region atria patient paroxysmal chronic atrial fibrillation . However , mechanism underlie hierarchical distribution frequency human AF explore . Our project try demonstrate general hypothesis local activation frequency degree regularity , different different part atrium , distribute non-randomly , different pattern distribution paroxysmal versus chronic AF patient . We surmise pattern result interrupted propagation impulse emanate driver localize site high frequency organization activity , gradual reduction activation frequency distance driver increase . To test hypothesis use combination clinical numerical study . For clinical part gather patient data two collaborative site Bordeaux , France Rochester , NY . The data obtain site analyze interpreted Institute Cardiovascular Research SUNY Upstate Medical University . For numerical part , simulation computer model AF perform solely Institute Cardiovascular Research . Our Specific Aims : 1 . In patient paroxysmal chronic AF , quantify high resolution rate regularity electrical signal AF . A novel online device allow map great detail particular area interest minimal increase risk patient . 2 . Characterize frequency activation AF patient heart surgery relate presence fibrosis . 3 . In paroxysmal AF patient , determine `` breakdown frequency '' rapid pace presence absence adenosine result wavefront fragmentation , reflect sudden change continuous interrupted activation . 3 . In computer simulation , study mechanism initiation maintenance AF PV/LA junction use three different computer model increase anatomical complexity ( description computer simulation available grant application ) . Successful achievement specific aim help u advance understanding mechanisms manifestation complex arrhythmia may help directly improve efficacy pharmacological ablative therapy AF patient .</detailed_description>
