	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Study Capecitabine After Total Gastrectomy Stomach Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : - To establish pharmacokinetics ( PK ) capecitabine patient undergone total gastrectomy Secondary Objectives : - To compare pharmacokinetic profile capecitabine administer patient gastric cancer pre- post-gastrectomy compare historical data capecitabine PK value patient cancer type . - To ensure equivalent capecitabine exposure compare PK data patient prior gastrectomy . This clinical trial evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) capecitabine patient undergone total gastrectomy . The study also aim establish toxicity profile capecitabine patient , identify dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , ensure equivalent capecitabine exposure compare PK data patient prior gastrectomy . Screening test consist demographic detail , complete medical history , physical exam , vital sign , tumour serum marker , haematology biochemistry test . There also ECG , chest X-Ray CT thorax , CT abdomen serum urine pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) . Haematology Biochemistry repeat prior study drug administration . All patient receive 6 cycle oral capecitabine chemotherapy dose 625 mg/m2 , administer twice daily 12 hourly interval 21 consecutive day . Total proposed duration therapy 3 cycle pre-operatively 3 cycle post-operatively . Capecitabine metabolite ( DFCR , DFUR 5-FU ) plasma level measure 1st 4th cycle patient . Treatment continue 6 cycle unless evidence disease progression , unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm gastric carcinoma suitable potentially curative resection . Surgery must plan involve total gastrectomy . No concurrent mechanical malabsorptive disorder preclude affective oral administration drug ( exclude early satiety relate presence malignancy ) . Age ≥ 18 year . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status ≤ 2 ( Appendix 1 ) . Haematological biochemical index ( These measurement must perform within one week prior patient go study . ) Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 9.0 g/dl Neutrophils ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelets ( Plts ) ≥ 100 x 109/L Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper normal limit Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) / aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . ( If measure , must ≤ 2.0 x ULN ) Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min ( uncorrected value ) isotope clearance measurement ≥ 50ml/min Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test prior enrolment agree use appropriate medically approve contraception four week prior enter trial , trial , six month afterwards . Male patient must agree use appropriate medically approve contraception trial six month afterwards . Written , inform consent provide . Ability patient cooperate treatment follow must ensure . Patients receive oral anticoagulation prior entry study , must convert low molecular weight heparin light interaction capecitabine warfarin . Patients gastric lymphoma histological diagnosis Any evidence malignant ascites , peritoneal liver metastasis , spread distant abdominal extraabdominal organ . History confirm Ischaemic Heart Disease , concurrent congestive heart failure prior history class III / IV cardiac disease ( Appendix 2 New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Scale ) Concurrent mechanical malabsorptive disorder preclude effective oral administration drug Use concomitant chemotherapy Pregnancy Lactation Patients know serologically positive Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) . Patients high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . Any serious medical psychological condition preclude adjuvant treatment Patients condition Investigator 's opinion would make patient good candidate clinical trial .</criteria>
