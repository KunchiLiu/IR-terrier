	<brief_summary>There four previous Total Therapy ( TT1 IIIB ) study multiple myeloma MIRT 1989 present . Results show participant treat study well outcome ( mean live longer well response treatment ) compare individual treat standard chemotherapy . Past study conduct MIRT show participant present MIRT already receive treatment myeloma tend short remission ( disappearance sign symptom myeloma ) survive long participant come MIRT untreated myeloma . Researchers MIRT think one reason may myeloma cell re-grow time participant receive treatment recover high-dose chemotherapy . In study , participant receive several chemotherapy drug previously show effective myeloma , low dos short cycle . It hop give drug way , myeloma cell time re-grow cycle , therefore result long remission . This study do attempt improve remission rate survival time participant high-risk myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To find give multi-agent chemotherapy lower frequent dos make timely delivery chemotherapy cycle possible , result good myeloma responses - To find changing way drug give transplant phase also result few side effect , still effective - To find give treatment transplant ( call `` inter-therapy '' ) prevent myeloma re-growing transplant - To find long-term maintenance therapy result long remission - To find effect ( good bad ) overall treatment - To learn biology genetics multiple myeloma perform image test collect blood , bone marrow aspirate biopsy , biopsy lesion see MRI PET scan . Bone marrow aspirate biopsy tissue sample collect bone cavity .</detailed_description>
