	<brief_title>Increasing Cure Rate Hepatitis C Therapy Obese Hepatitis C Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design interventional , prospective , randomize , double-blinded case-control clinical trial . Procedures do Center Liver Diseases , 9'Th floor Kaufmann medical building , UPMC , USA . This study also carry National Liver Institute , Egypt . For treatment-naïve patient , target 32 subject group ; however , go include 37 group allow estimate drop-outs rate 15 % . Subjects randomly assign 4 group follow : Group 1 include non-obese control ( BMI &lt; 25 ) . They receive one session dietary behavioral education . Groups 2 , 3 4 include obese subject ( BMI ≥ 30 ) . Group 2 include obese control receive one session dietary behavioral education . Groups 3 4 receive 6 weekly session follow 12 monthly session dietary behavioral education . Orlistat placebo prescribe Groups 3 4 respectively . For non-responders releasers previous anti-hepatitis C therapy BMI ≥ 25 ( overweight obese ) , subject randomize group 5 6 receive treatment group 3 4 , respectively . Their result compare historic control result . Screening procedure : Verifying eligibility patient participation study do review data medical history , physical examination investigation include patient ' medical record . Acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) status participate subject determine review HIV ELISA screen test , report subject 's medical record well . Measurements weight height ( BMI calculation ) take recorded initial clinic visit center liver diseases patient agree participate fulfill inclusion exclusion criterion . Weight measure take patient light underwear without shoe , stand arm lie alongside body , apnea fix midexpiratory phase height measure take wall-mounted stadiometer record near cm . Experimental procedure : Subjects randomly group group simple randomization method . One investigator pick one fold paper plastic bag contain folded paper label folded side number group . Further randomization do pharmacy way include treatment naïve candidate group 3 4 include treatment non naïve candidate group 5 6 . Therefore , study team blind type drug candidate receive , whether Orlistat placebo , respectively . Groups 1 2 control group receive one session dietary physical education , start receive standard hepatitis C treatment . Groups 3 , 4 , 5 6 interventional group receive 6 session dietary physical education start receive standard hepatitis C treatment . Groups 3 4 encourage attend 12 monthly meeting ( along side monthly visit standard viral hepatitis therapy ) health education room center liver disease , check dietary diary patient record physical activity , discus related issue , reinforce encourage compliance dietary physical exercise recommendation . The dietary physical education ( give 6 weekly session subsequently 12 monthly follow-up meeting ) present . It base previously report ( Kelley et al . 2004 ) lifestyle modification dietary regulation program include healthy food selection , emphasize reduce fat consumption ( &lt; =30 % daily calorie ) restriction portion create daily negative energy balance ~500 kcal/day . Participants encourage start 10 minute physical activity walk cycle gradually increase activity duration 30 minute . The dietitian provide subject diary daily record dietary intake . Orlistat ( 60 mg capsule , three time daily , meal ) prescribe group 3 5 . Placebo administer group 4 6 . Orlistat Placebo give 3 6 week prior 48 week standard anti-viral therapy . Pill count obtain monthly monitor medication compliance . Stress assessment do study candidate stress specific questionnaire start study every 12 week afterwards . Stool sample take patient start Interferon therapy every 12 week therapy . Stool sample store -80 degree Celsius future PCR study fecal micro flora . Follow-up procedure : Virological biochemical response follow clinically indicated clinical provider . Anthropometric measure obesity measurement weight , height ( BMI calculation ) , waist circumference , hip circumference , skin fold thickness mid-arm circumference monthly follow record . Midarm circumference triceps skin fold thickness measure left arm midway tip acromion tip olecranon record near 5 cm . Skin fold thickness measure triceps . Waist circumference measure midway iliac crest low rib margin , hip circumference level great trochanter ( Han et al . 2001 ) .</detailed_description>
