	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Dexmedetomidine During Non-Invasive Positive Pressure Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) increasingly use manage patient acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) effort avoid numerous negative sequela associate intubation mechanical ventilation . In USA , estimate 20-30 % patient place mechanical ventilation treat NPPV . Indications NPPV include limited acute acute-on-chronic hypercapnic respiratory failure , pulmonary edema , respiratory failure immunocompromised patient due chest wall deformity neuromuscular disease . For NPPV successful , critical patient cooperative comfortable ( i.e . pain ) agitation discomfort interfere success NPPV . Despite importance patient comfort NPPV , physicians infrequently use sedation analgesic therapy NPPV , primarily due concern respiratory depressant effect sedative ( e.g. , benzodiazepine ) analgesic ( e.g. , opioids ) currently available . In addition , neither benzodiazepine opioids easily titratable , easily accumulate associate development delirium withdrawal effect . Dexmedetomidine intravenous rapid-onset , short act ά 2-receptor agonist approve short-term sedation post-operative critically ill patient . It state drug produce state `` cooperative sedation '' allow patient interact health care provider . Dexmedetomidine use ability cause sympatholysis , analgesic property , decrease need opioids . Potential advantage include short half life intravenous route administration , permit rapid titration achieve sedation target , patient respiratory failure ; provide sedation analgesia without induce respiratory depression . Despite advantage , currently use less 5 % pulmonologists/ intensivists primary sedative option NPPV study control fashion population . Therefore , dexmedetomidine may prove efficacious safe compare standard sedation/analgesic therapy NPPV .</detailed_description>
