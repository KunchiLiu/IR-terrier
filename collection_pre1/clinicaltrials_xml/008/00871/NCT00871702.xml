	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To determine significant toxicity associate administration CD34-TK75 transduce donor lymphocyte allogeneic BMT relapse hematologic malignancy Secondary Objectives : - To determine patient develops evidence anti-leukemic effect administration CD34-TK75 transduce donor lymphocytes - To determine ganciclovir administration patient develop Graft versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) result clinical improvement infusion CD34-TK75 transduce lymphocyte . Sub-Study Objective The primary purpose perform PET image CD34-TK transduce allogeneic donor T cell patient relapse hematologic malignancy allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . At time limited amount cGMP quality virus produce NGVL likely permit image 3 patient . Consequently current objective establish TK-expressing cell detect 18FHBG-PET patient organ relevant perform additional study currently plan stage work produce additional virus . The ultimate objective use TK substrate 18FHBG locate donor T cell within recipient exert anti-leukemic effect , T cell eliminate response vivo administration ganciclovir , morbidity mortality GvHD occur . We use image strategy define pattern T cell traffic human pre post-DLI infusion , determine cell reside mediate GVL contrast GvHD . We expect obtain vivo PET image marker predictive GvHD clinical symptom occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase I study determine safety administration lymphocytes , collect bone marrow donor . Donor lymphocytes often administer case relapse cancer allogeneic bone marrow transplantation , hope reduce amount size relapse cancer . In study , look decrease size relapse cancer . By insert genetic material ( DNA ) cell ( lymphocyte ) collect donor , cell genetically modify make sensitive killing effect drug call ganciclovir , routinely use clinic bone marrow transplantation treat virus infection transplant patient . This research study determine , administration drug ganciclovir recipient , intravenous infusion genetically modify cell ( lymphocyte ) recipient , reduce even eliminate life threaten complication allogeneic transplantation , call graft versus host disease ( GvHD ) . The drug ganciclovir kill infuse genetically modify donor cell ( lymphocyte ) cause GvHD . In summary , overall purpose research study determine , administration seven day course drug ganciclovir donor lymphocyte recipient either decrease severity GvHD , decrease number case life-threatening GvHD donor lymphocyte infusion . This study also determine insertion small piece DNA ( small piece genetic material ) , make donor lymphocyte open sensitive kill effect drug ganciclovir , time harm lymphocyte ' ability reduce amount size cancer recipient . The DNA insert donor lymphocyte transport cell type virus call `` retrovirus vector '' . This retrovirus vector make virus divide ( make ) , make cell recipient sick . Retroviruses , however , allow gene ( DNA ) carrying , permanently insert genetic material donor lymphocytes . Therefore , insert DNA persist donor lymphocytes life lymphocyte . Finally , study also determine administration genetically manipulate donor lymphocyte well tolerate . Sub Study The goal subproject see imaging procedure call 18FHBG-PET/CT help u see lymphocytes receive go site body anti-cancer effect take place .</detailed_description>
