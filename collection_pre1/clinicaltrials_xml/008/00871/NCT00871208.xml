	<brief_title>Trial Treatment Atopic Dermatitis With Concurrent Altabax® Topical Low-Potency Corticosteroids Versus Low-Potency Corticosteroid Mono-therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Atopic dermatitis pruritic skin disorder affect 10 % United States population , one-third report sleep disturbance quarter chronic unremitting disease . Atopic dermatitis recurrent pruritic skin disorder significant morbidity extensive cost health care system . Quality life often impaired patient atopic dermatitis due sleep disturbance , pruritus physical impairment visible skin lesion . The rapidity pruritus lesional appearance note resolve correlate strongly improve patient satisfaction improve quality life . Recently , clinical trial add mupirocin regimen topical corticosteroid show significant enhancement lesional clearance symptom reduction addition mupirocin topical corticosteroid . These improvement notable within first week treatment . Proposal : A 4-week clinical trial 60 atopic dermatitis patient ( age 9 month 17 year ) would conduct . All sixty patient would give topical mid-potency corticosteroid ( Locoid lipocream® ) mixed second product . Half patient would receive Altabax® half would receive vehicle ( blind subject investigator ) . Patients would advise apply topical randomized product first , let dry apply topical Locoid lipocream ® affect area , apply topical randomize ointment product sit skin disease top Locoid lipocream ® . Treatment affect area would continue 4 week lesion clear , ever come first . Parents patient ask maintain write diary drug application .</detailed_description>
