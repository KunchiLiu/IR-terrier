	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect give laboratory-treated T cell ipilimumab together see well work treat patient metastatic melanoma . Treating patient 's T cell laboratory may help T cell kill tumor cell put back body . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving laboratory-treated T cell together ipilimumab may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety efficacy adoptively transfer cytotoxic lymphocyte ( CTL ) target melanoma tumor combine anti-CTLA4 . II . Evaluate influence anti-CTLA4 ( ipilimumab ) duration vivo persistence anti-tumor efficacy achieve follow adoptive transfer antigen-specific CTL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate influence anti-CTLA4 induction T cell non-targeted tumor-associated antigen ( antigen-spreading ) follow adoptive transfer antigen-specific CTL , correlation response clinical outcome . OUTLINE : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -2 , therapeutic allogeneic cytotoxic T lymphocytes IV 30-60 minute day 0 , low-dose aldesleukin subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) day 0-13 , ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 , 22 , 43 , 64 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
