	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis relate cystic fibrosis ( non-CF bronchiectasis ) chronic respiratory condition characterise permanent dilatation airway arise bronchial inflammation infection . Predominant symptom include daily productive cough , dyspnoea generalise fatigue . This profile associate diminish health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) reduce exercise tolerance . Available medical treatment bronchiectasis include antibiotic inhalation therapy . To date , evidence treatment reduce exacerbation rate modify rate disease progression . While international guideline pulmonary rehabilitation recommend inclusion patient bronchiectasis , deficiency evidence support exercise training population . It propose standard exercise training program conduct accord Australian guideline pulmonary rehabilitation improve exercise capacity , quality life reduce number acute infection short long term people bronchiectasis .</detailed_description>
