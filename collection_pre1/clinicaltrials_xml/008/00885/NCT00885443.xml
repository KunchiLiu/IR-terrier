	<brief_summary>Emergence delirium ( ED ) refers wide variety behavioural disturbance commonly see child follow emergence anesthesia . ED potentially dangerous serious consequence child injury , increase pain , dislodgement medical device , often require physical restraint pharmacological control . Witnessing behaviour stressful parent , negatively affect interaction healthcare system , relationship child , nursing staff healthcare provider . The investigator aim minimize ED reduce distress experienced patient parent . This study compare recovery profile sevoflurane propofol remifentanil associate incidence ED . This study enable u determine form anesthesia associate few incidence ED child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Emergence Delirium Children : Total Intravenous Anesthesia With Propofol Remifentanil Versus Inhalational Sevoflurane Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : In child , propofol-only anesthesia maintenance infusion single postoperative propofol bolus show efficacious reduce ED compare sevoflurane [ 13 , 17 ] . Methodological problem study include : administration sedative premedications , ED provocative study design reflect reasonable clinical practice sevoflurane , use inadequately validate ED outcome tool . Based extensive institutional experience TIVA , believe technique superior sevoflurane respect incidence ED . However , clinical impression never validate appropriately robust investigation , sevoflurane remain pediatric anesthetic choice North American pediatric anesthesiologist . Hypotheses : 1 . The use total intravenous anesthesia ( TIVA ) , rather sevoflurane ( SEVO ) reduce incidence ED , measure Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium ( PAED ) scale . 2 . The use TIVA result longer time laryngeal mask airway removal post anesthetic care unit ( PACU ) discharge compare SEVO . Objectives : 1 . To compare incidence ED SEVO TIVA anesthesia child 2 . To compare time recovery anesthesia TIVA SEVO group Research Method : Recruitment subject : With institutional review board approval , write informed consent , recruit child , age 2-6 year , undergo elective strabismus surgery , relatively minor eye procedure . Each child randomly assign one two group receive either TIVA SEVO . We exclude child ASA status IV-V , developmental delay , neurological injury , psychiatric diagnosis , abnormal lipid carbohydrate metabolism , postoperative nausea vomiting , Body Mass Index &gt; 30 , severe anxiety pre-operative period require sedative premedication complex medical condition . Study design : This study randomize , mask clinical trial compare induction maintenance anesthesia TIVA SEVO . Every effort make maximize masking observer . All patient score Research Fellow , Dr. John Chandler , mask anesthetic technique . To evaluate pre postoperative state child use follow scoring tool : 1 . The Induction Compliance Checklist ( ICC ) use evaluate patient preoperative behaviour 2 . The PAED scale use assess patient ED PACU . 3 . Pain assessed postoperatively mean face , leg , activity , cry , consolability ( FLACC ) score currently use PACU Statistical Analysis : Patients PAED score ≥ 10 classify experience ED . Continuous data ( weight , BMI ) analyze t-tests ordinal data ( FLACC , PAED , ICC ) Mann-Whitney U test . The primary hypothesis examine mean contingency table Fisher 's exact test .</detailed_description>
