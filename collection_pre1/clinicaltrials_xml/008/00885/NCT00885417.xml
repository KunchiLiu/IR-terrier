	<brief_summary>Helicobacter pylorus infection show associate development gastric cancer peptic ulcer disease . Eradication H. pylorus infection could reduce occurence recurrence disease . However , estimate 15-20 % patient would fail first line standard eradication therapy need second line rescue therapy . About 15-30 % patient would fail second line therapy need rescue third line therapy . The commonly used salvage regimen include : 1 . Bismuth base quadruple therapy ( combined ranitidine proton-pump inhibitor ( PPI ) plus two antibiotic ) 2 . Levofloxacin moxifloxacin rifabutin base triple therapy . However , Bismuth available many country administration method complex . Its usage limited high pill number low compliance rate . In recent year , concept sequential therapy advocate treatment H. pylorus infection . The regimen include PPI plus amoxicillin five day , follow PPI plus clarithromycin metronidazole another five day . The eradication rate first line treatment sequential therapy report high 90 % . More importantly , demonstrate eradication rate among patient clarithromycin-resistant strain could high 89 % . Aims : Therefore , investigator aim assess efficacy levofloxacin-based sequential therapy second line therapy fail one standard eradication therapy .</brief_summary>
