	<brief_summary>Background : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use strong magnetic field radio wave take picture brain . Some MRI study suggest technique reveals brain difference patient nervous system illness compare adult without nervous system illness . Objectives : - To study functional change brain may observe people without nervous system illness . - To learn area brain necessary perform certain task , especially learn simple motor sequence processing reward . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer age 18 50 right-handed native English speaker , medical condition would prevent undergoing magnetic imaging . - Volunteers must history neurological psychiatric illness . - Female volunteer must pregnant . Design : - Volunteers ask undergo different type magnetic imaging , include functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) , and/or transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , participate either slot machine simulation key sequence learn task . - Volunteers participate one four possible experiment : - Experiment 1 : MRS/TMS slot machine ( 3 visit , 3.5 hour total ) . - Experiment 2 : MRS/TMS key sequence ( 3 visit , 3.5 hour total ) . - Experiment 3 : fMRI slot machine ( 2 visit , 3 hour total ) . - Experiment 4 : fMRI key sequence ( 1 visit , 2 hour total ) . - Experiment type : - Slot machine : A computer game like slot machine , user press button start game watch three barrel machine spin place . - Key sequence : Pressing series button response visual cue . - Volunteers also ask give small blood sample genetic testing . - Volunteers pay small amount money ( approximately $ 50 $ 80 ) experiment compensation participation study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The role mesencephalic dopamine neuron reward process establish primate use electrophysiological technique human use functional neuroimaging . They rich projection prefrontal motor cortex synapse interneurons cortical pyramidal cell , produce primarily inhibition . Though function fully understood , projection clearly play important role motivation learn . We recently develop paradigm detect reward-related signal primary motor cortex , use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , demonstrate increased inhibition primary motor cortex condition increase reward expectancy . These result suggest motor learning , depend critically motor cortex , may influence reward , may take form simple performance feedback human . This kind feedback also allow subject predict outcome action . Thus , present objective investigate influence reward/feedback/prediction activity primary motor cortex motor learn particular instance increase reward expectancy . Further , examine role brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) single nucleotide polymorphism motor learning . Study Population : The population study healthy volunteer age 18-50 , without significant medical history contraindication functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Design : All experiment employ within- between-subjects fMRI magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) measure change activation different cortical area response motor learn reward . Outcome Measures : The outcome measure ( ) grade change blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD ) response motor learn reward ( b ) variation GABA concentration response motor learn reward , c ) variation response time behavioral performance learn task .</detailed_description>
