	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Zoledronic acid may stop growth tumor cell bone . Giving bevacizumab together cyclophosphamide zoledronic acid may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect give bevacizumab together cyclophosphamide zoledronic acid treat patient recurrent refractory high-risk neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>N2007-02 : Bevacizumab , Cyclophosphamide , &amp; Zoledronic Acid Patients W/ Recurrent Refractory High-Risk Neuroblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine toxicity feasibility bolus metronomic cyclophosphamide give combination zoledronic acid without bevacizumab patient recurrent refractory high-risk neuroblastoma . Secondary - To preliminarily evaluate antitumor activity regimen patient within confines pilot study . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour zoledronic acid IV 15 minute day 0 oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-27 course 1 . In course 2 subsequent course , patient receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 0 14 , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour zoledronic acid IV 15 minute day 1 , oral cyclophosphamide daily day 0 2-27 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 years* absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients may receive 13 dos zoledronic acid . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must 30 year age enrol study . Patients must relapse neuroblastoma , refractory neuroblastoma less partial response standard treatment persistent neuroblastoma least partial response standard treatment . Patients least partial response standard treatment still neuroblastoma see CT/MRI MIBG scan must surgical biopsy do tumor confirm neuroblastoma . Patients relapse refractory neuroblastoma need biopsy do enter study . Patients must adequate heart , kidney , liver blood clot bone marrow function . Patients bone marrow disease must meet bone marrow function criterion enter study . Patients must recover prior chemotherapy surgical procedure They know sensitive Bevacizumab . They history high blood pressure require intensive intervention They pregnant breastfeed Neuroblastoma present brain CT MRI scan do study entry . Patients neuroblastoma find bone skull eligible tumor mass associate press brain . They history non heal wound</criteria>
