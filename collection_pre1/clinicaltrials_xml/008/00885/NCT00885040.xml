	<brief_summary>Background : - Many people learn use feedback brain activity modify activity , know people Tourette syndrome modify brain activity . - Researchers evidence certain area brain involve causing tic people Tourette syndrome . If people Tourette syndrome use feedback brain activity modify activity part brain , may able modify brain activity help control tic . Objectives : - To determine people without Tourette syndrome learn use think control brain activity . - To test whether people Tourette syndrome learn control brain activity , possibly help control tic . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer age 18 old right-handed willing consume caffeine alcohol 24 hour study visit . - Patients Tourette syndrome tic observe study . - All participant must able undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Design : - Healthy volunteer ( two visit NIH Clinical Center 2- 4-week period ; visit may last 3 hour ) : - Screening visit , include physical examination medical history , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan individual one perform National Institutes Health past year . - Study visit : Functional MRI ( fMRI ) scan allow researcher see volunteer learn control brain activity scan . Volunteers ask complete task direct fMRI scan . - Patients Tourette syndrome ( three four outpatient visit 4- 6-week period ; visit may last 4 hour ) : - Screening visit , include physical examination medical history , MRI scan individual one perform National Institutes Health past year . - Evaluation visit ask question Tourette symptom patient complete questionnaire tic mental health . - Study visit : fMRI scan allow researcher see patient learn control brain activity scan . Patients ask complete task direct fMRI scan . - Final visit : Researchers ask question tic symptom , patient complete questionnaire , perform brief exam . Afterward , patient fMRI scan similar previous one . - All participant pay small amount money compensation participation study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Neurofeedback With Real-Time fMRI Healthy Volunteers Patients With Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective study see healthy volunteer patient hyperkinetic movement disorder Tic Disorders ( TD ) include Tourette Syndrome ( TS ) able learn alter brain activity use feedback functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , whether feedback train lead improvement symptom TD patient . Study population : This study carry three phase . In Phase 1 study feedback technique use fMRI right-handed adult healthy volunteer , Phase 2 intend study right-handed adult patient TD also able learn feedback technique , Phase 3 intend study whether feedback training fMRI lead improvement symptom TD patient whether patient able retain ability alter brain activity . Design : Phase 1 : Healthy volunteer show image corresponds brain activity measure continuously fMRI scan ask attempt alter activity first simple finger-tapping task thought . Phase 1 require two visit ( one screen one scanning ) ( complete ) . Phase 1a : A pilot study evaluate ability healthy volunteer learn modulate brain connectivity use feedback connectivity pattern two motor region real-time fMRI paradigm . Phase 1a require three visit ( one screen two scan evaluation ) . Phase 1b : Healthy volunteer show image corresponds brain activity measure continuously fMRI scan ask attempt alter activity thought suppress blink . Phase 2 : TD patient study see learn alter brain activity similar way healthy volunteer . Patients symptom videotape brief interview scan . Phase 2 require three visit ( one screening , one evaluation , one scanning ) . Phase 3 : The effect alter brain activity specific brain area symptom TD patient study . Patients ask continue focus thought feedback scan time feel urge prior tic every hour awake , whichever frequent , follow-up visit fMRI scan two three day later . Phase 3 require four visit ( one screening , one evaluation , one scanning , one follow-up ) . No visit last 4 hour . Outcome measure : The primary outcome Phases 1 2 difference brain activation within specific area feedback training compare baseline , Phase 3 difference symptom measure TS rating scale fMRI scan compare two three day learn feedback technique . Secondary outcome three phase include change activation specific brain area compare baseline repeat scan trial feedback image display .</detailed_description>
