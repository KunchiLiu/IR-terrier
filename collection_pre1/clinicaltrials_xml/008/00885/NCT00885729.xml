	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - Compare treatment efficacy autologous mesenchymal stem cell ( Mesenchymal Stem Cells ) versus chondrocytes implanted commercial available scaffold human clinical trial . - Determine effect specific three month strength train program preoperatively improve knee function possible postpone need cartilage repair surgery . - Determine degenerative change occur knee joint follow cartilage repair . This question investigate proposed clinical trial . - Determine characteristic patient treat either surgery rehabilitation long-term follow-up ( 1 , 5 year ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Musculoskeletal disease grow Norwegian population currently large group chronic disease ( 31 % ) . Musculoskeletal disease large cause disability work part population ( 49 % ) . The frequent problem rheumatism , osteoarthritis unspecific back pain . The common known etiology traumatic event towards joint . Often , degenerative development start small injury cartilage weightbearing surface joint . This lead change surround cartilage , indicative degenerative joint disease arthrosis . When injured area become large 2 cm2 , patient seem experience pain . Our group show 11 % patient , underwent arthroscopy knee pain , cartilage injury weightbearing surface depth bone ( grade IV ) ( Aroen et al . ) .Unfortunately , articular cartilage show limit capacity healing . Several surgical technique develop fill cartilage defect , far none able produce normal cartilage Chondrocyte implantation technique date popular treatment , demonstrate superiority cartilage repair technique . Some clinical randomised study exist though thorough review cartilage repair method study Jakobsen coauthor verify conclusion could make consider treatment option articular cartilage injury ( Jakobsen , Engebretsen , Slauterbeck ) . Although natural history lesion finally outline clear patient disruption cartilage surface impose disability especially young athlete . The clinical study report significant improvement preoperative status although full knee function obtain either technique available today ( Bentley et al . ; Brittberg et al . ; Horas et al . ; Knutsen et al. ) . The expected Lysholm score 80 standard deviation tend large report illustrate considerable variation full knee function obtain ( Peterson et al . ) .The impact disrupt cartilage surface obtain chondrocytes culture gain much attention clinical study use repair method . However report adverse effect exist result harvest chondrocytes culture ( Whittaker et al. ) . Whittaker coauthor observe harvest chondrocytes cell culture subsequent implantation talus result mean 15 point reduction Lysholm score 7 10 patient . Furthermore , additional even best hand mean Lysholm score 79 obtain single lesion femoral condyle ( Peterson et al. ) . Even though new scaffold seem reduce rate reoperation result graft hypertrophy 21 % 9 % , harvest procedure cartilage may still contribute suboptimal approach ( Bartlett et al . ; Gooding et al. ) . Consequently , need good cause less morbidity harvesting . Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) represent alternative cell source potential generate hyaline cartilage without adverse effect . In addition MSC cell available culture potential treatment large lesion possible . Furthermore , repair potential mesenchymal stem cell expect decrease age indicate also age athlete may benefit procedure base cartilage repair cell source ( Dressler , Butler , Boivin ) . The use mesenchymal stem cell aspirate iliaca crest periosteum flap support view might option treat knee cartilage defect success , although study also periosteum hypertrophy side effect one patient ( Slynarski , Deszczynski , Karpinski ) . The beneficial effect therapy also report study clinical experimental one ( Takagi et al . ; Wakitani et al . ; Wakitani et al . ; Wakitani et al. ) . Thus , current project investigate similar result obtain mesenchymal stem cell chondrocytes delivered commercial available scaffold clinical trial patient eligible current treatment option .</detailed_description>
