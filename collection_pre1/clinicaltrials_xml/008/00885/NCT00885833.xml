	<brief_summary>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) rare X-linked congenital immune-deficiency syndrome hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) become curative modality . But transplant conventional conditioning result high incidence treatment related toxicity non-myeloablative conditioning result high incidence engraftment failure . Recently , fludarabine base reduced toxicity myeloablative conditioning regimen develop adult myeloid malignancy promise result good engraftment low treatment related toxicity . To increase engraftment potential without serious complication , reduce toxicity myeloablative conditioning regimen compose fludarabine , busulfan , thymoglobulin design Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Reduced Toxicity Myeloablative Conditioning Regimen Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome ( WAS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome ( WAS ) rare X-linked congenital immune-deficiency syndrome characterize triad recurrent infection , eczema thrombocytopenia small size platelet ( Puck JM , 2006 ) . Clinical study reveal high rate autoimmune disorder malignancy WAS ( Ochs HD , 2006 ) . The identification molecular defect 1994 ( Derry JM , 1994 ) broaden clinical spectrum syndrome include chronic intermittent X-linked thrombocytopenia ( XLT ) , relatively mild form WAS X-lined neutropenia cause arrest myelopoiesis ( Ochs HD , 2006 ) . The incidence WAS Korea low 6 patient diagnosed 2001 2005 ( Kim JG , 2006 ) . Conventional treatment WAS prophylactic antibiotic immune globin infection platelet transfusion bleed successful ( Thrasher AJ , 2000 ) . Bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) HLA-matched related donor effective treatment ( Filipovich AH , 2001 ) patient without appropriate relate donor could receive alternative stem cell source match unrelated donor cord blood . But transplant alternative donor need intensive conditioning overcome hematologic immunologic barrier increase treatment related toxicity . Further progress depend particular development alternative preparative conditioning regimen allow stable engraftment donor precursor cell minimal systemic toxic side effect ( Friedrich W , 2004 ) . Recently , report successful unrelated bone marrow transplantation boy WAS reduce toxicity myeloablative conditioning regimen increase engraftment potential without serious complication ( Kang , 2008 ) , extend multicenter phase I/II pilot study reduce toxicity myeloablative condition regimen HSCT WAS .</detailed_description>
