	<brief_title>Immune Reconstitution Determinant Adverse Effects New Antiretroviral Therapy Persons With Advanced HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . To compare incidence severity self-reported symptom person CD4 count &lt; 100 cells/mm3 versus CD4 count ≥ 100 cells/mm3 initiate antiretroviral therapy . 2 . To determine relationship self-reported symptom level T cell , HIV RNA , activation marker cytokine include TNF-α , IFN-γ , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-6 , IL-10 cytokine measure initiation antiretroviral therapy . 3 . To determine relationship antiretroviral drug trough level ( estimate drug concentration ) incidence severity self-reported symptom person initiate antiretroviral therapy . 4 . To determine relationship adverse event immunological status evidence lymphocyte count activation marker cytokine level . 5 . To determine relationship clinical event immunological status evidence lymphocyte count activation marker cytokine level .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; 18 year 2 . Diagnosis HIV infection . 3 . Naive antiretroviral therapy OR use antiretrovirals ≥ 6 month . 1 . Blinded drug treatment . 2 . Active untreated serious infection within 14 day enrollment opinion investigator would affect subject 's participation and/or safety study . 3 . Known resistance propose new HIV regimen component regimen . 4 . Requirement drug therapy know contraindication propose new antiretroviral therapy ( see Prohibited Precautionary Medications ) 5 . Pregnancy breast feed . 6 . Liver enzyme abnormality screen . Patients symptomatic Grade 3 elevation total bilirubin , AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase Grade &gt; 3 elevation total bilirubin , AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase exclude . Patients asymptomatic grade 3 elevation total bilirubin , AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase may include study discretion primary physician consultation principal senior investigator . Patients grade 3 elevation liver function test coinfected hepatitis B hepatitis C may include study discretion primary care physician consultation primary senior investigator provide sign symptom clinical hepatitis . Signs clinical hepatitis include : icterus , abdominal tenderness hepatosplenomegaly . Symptoms clinical hepatitis include : fever , abdominal pain , anorexia , nausea , vomit , fatigue , malaise , myalgia . 7 . Decreased creatinine clearance time screen .
