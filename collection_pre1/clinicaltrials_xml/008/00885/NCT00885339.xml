	<brief_title>Evaluation PillCam™ Colon Capsule Endoscopy ( PCCE ) Preparation Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The evaluation subject suspect colonic disease include endoscopic image colonoscopy radiologic image air-contrast barium enema , CT colonography . The PillCam platform offer alternative approach endoscopic visualization colon use capsule endoscopy , ingestible device contain imagers , light source , power source RF transmitter . Advantages PillCam platform include elimination need sedation , minimally invasive , painless nature exam , ability pursue normal daily activity immediately follow procedure . Furthermore , compare standard colonoscopy , PillCam platform may readily accept subject , thereby improve subject ' willingness undergo diagnostic evaluation colon comply colorectal cancer screen recommendation . The PillCam™ SB capsule ( formerly M2A® Capsule ) FDA-approved August 2001 small bowel evaluation ingest date 500,000 people worldwide well accepted patient physician well processional society . However , adequate visualization colon achieve standard PillCam™ SB capsule anatomical physiological property colon significantly different small bowel . Moreover , issue limit evaluation colonic mucosa standard PillCam™ SB procedure include unsatisfactory level colon cleanliness slow progression PillCam™ SB capsule colon desire examination time . Therefore , development introduction specially design , customize colon capsule combine dedicated capsule colonoscopy procedure protocol allow efficient evaluation colonic mucosa . This expect improve capability PillCam platform detect colonic pathology serve diagnostic screening tool colonic disease . Further detail PillCam™ Colon Capsule Endoscope ( PCCE ) find device description section . This pilot study design compare level cleanliness visualization colon achieve colon capsule endoscopy use two different regimen preparation colon . Furthermore , capsule colonoscopy colonoscopy procedure compare regard level colon cleanliness detection lesion colon . The study conduct 2 phase : pilot phase optimal procedure determine follow comparison two procedure . The second phase validation propose procedure .</detailed_description>
