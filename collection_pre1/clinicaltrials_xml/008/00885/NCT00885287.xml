	<brief_summary>As HIV/AIDS spread malaria-endemic country , many patient need concomitant treatment infection . Effective combination treatment available malaria ( artemisinin-based combination treatment , ACTs ) HIV/AIDS ( antiretroviral combination treatment , ARTs ) , treatment presently recommend concomitant use ministry health many endemic country , include Tanzania . However , theoretically drug may involve harmful interaction , share common cytochrome enzyme involve metabolism . Such interaction could lead less effective treatment and/or adverse effect , consequence reduce increase drug level , respectively . Only little clinical pharmacological information however yet available guide clinicians policy-makers issue . The main aim InterACT study Tanzania conduct series detail observational study clinical paraclinical safety , therapeutic efficacy pharmacokinetic interaction currently nationally recommended first-line treatment malaria , artemether-lumefantrine , first-line antiretroviral treatment , primarily nevirapine-based combination , HIV/AIDS . The study conduct among patient uncomplicated malaria , attend HIV/AIDS Care Treatment Clinic Muheza Designated District Hospital Muheza , north-eastern Tanzania , area characterize intense transmission Plasmodium falciparum malaria prevalence HIV around 8-10 % . The study expect inform guideline treatment malaria patient HIV/AIDS Tanzania , elsewhere .</brief_summary>
