	<brief_summary>Qigong therapy subtle energy-based methodology prevent heal disease practice remarkable result China five thousand year . Recently , preliminary study show Qigong exercise improve insulin resistance glucose metabolism people type 2 diabetes . These study suggest Qigong therapy might effective valuable complementary modality treat type 2 diabetes . Type 2 diabetes chronic disease mark abnormally high level sugar blood . Diabetes serious disease , , control , life threatening . The purpose project conduct randomize , control pilot clinical trial compare effectiveness Qigong therapy mild exercise conventional treatment type 2 diabetes identify biological psychological characteristic associated subject ' response Qigong therapy . Aim 1 : To compare effect blood sugar hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) level Qigong therapy group non-treated control group well Qigong group progressive resistance training ( PRT ) group , 12-week intervention . Hypothesis 1 : Both Qigong therapy PRT help type 2 diabetic patient reduce blood sugar level different degree improve insulin resistance . But level reduction blood sugar great Qigong therapy PRT due enhance insulin secretion . Aim 2 : To compare effect fast C-peptide insulin level Qigong therapy group , PRT group non-treated control group intervention . Hypothesis 2 : Qigong therapy increase endogenous insulin C-peptide level restore function pancreas , PRT alter either insulin C-peptide level . Aim 3 : To compare effect Qigong therapy PRT blood cortisol level psychological stress level , intervention . Hypothesis 3 : Perceived stress depression improve Qigong therapy great extent PRT , blood cortisol level reduce great extent Qigong therapy .</brief_summary>
