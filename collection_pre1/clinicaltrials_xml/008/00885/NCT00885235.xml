	<brief_title>Evaluation PillCam™ Colon Capsule Endoscopy ( PCCE ) Preparation Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The evaluation subject suspect colonic disease include endoscopic image colonoscopy radiologic image air-contrast barium enema , CT colonography . The PillCam® platform offer alternative approach endoscopic visualization colon use capsule endoscopy , ingestible device contain imagers , light source , power source radio frequency transmitter . Advantages PillCam® platform include elimination need sedation , minimally invasive , painless nature exam , ability pursue normal daily activity immediately follow procedure . Furthermore , compare standard colonoscopy , PillCam® platform may readily accept patient thereby improve compliance colorectal cancer screen recommendation . The PillCam® SB capsule ( formerly M2A® Capsule ) clear FDA August 2001 small bowel evaluation ingest date 700,000 people worldwide well accepted patient physician well major gastrointestinal professional organization . However , adequate visualization colon achieve standard PillCam®SB capsule anatomical physiological property colon significantly different small bowel . Moreover , issue limit evaluation colonic mucosa standard PillCam® SB procedure include unsatisfactory level colon cleanliness slow progression PillCam® SB capsule colon desire examination time . Therefore , development introduction specially design , customize colon capsule combine specifically design capsule colonoscopy procedure allow efficient evaluation colonic mucosa . This expect improve capability PillCam® platform detect colonic pathology serve diagnostic screening tool colonic disease . Further detail PillCam™ Colon Capsule Endoscope ( PCCE ) find device description section . This pilot study design develop optimal PCCE procedure measuring level cleanliness capsule excretion rate . Furthermore , capsule endoscopy colonoscopy procedure compare regard detection polyp lesion colon .</detailed_description>
