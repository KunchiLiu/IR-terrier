	<brief_summary>To enhance capacity correctly choose appropriate medication ADHD patient first try base presence particular variant gene could identify laboratory test . It hypothesize patient Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) fail respond methylphenidate medication , respond amphetamine , high expect incidence allelic variant SNAP 25 gene associate ADHD , mutation dopamine system gene DRD1 , 2 , 4 , 5 dopamine transporter COMTand MAOA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SNAP 25 Gene Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research demonstrate 75 % patient respond stimulant , 33 % respond stimulant class . Based previous research correlate increase mutation dopamine system gene DRD1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , dopamine transporter , COMT , MAOA ADHD , also investigate relationship mutation gene patient response MPH amphetamine . This study pilot , obvious next step study do genetics ADHD . The outcome research , whether association find , considerable interest researcher internationally , demonstrate value HELP funding promote research alleviate mental illness child The study make significant contribution appropriate intervention child , promote great awareness deficit suffer child attention problem neither willful matter intelligence , rather syndrome explain modified appropriate medical care . A chi-square test conduct determine whether differential representation SNAP 25 among therapeutic methylphenidate responder versus non-responders . Statistical comparison perform use two-tailed test .05 level significance .</detailed_description>
