	<brief_title>High-Dose Fluconazole Treatment Cryptococcal Meningitis HIV-Infected Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CM common central nervous system ( CNS ) complication AIDS worldwide account third death AIDS many develop country . Current treatment CM lack effectiveness accessibility , particularly limited-resources setting . Conventional therapy utilize amphotericin B deoxycholate ( ampho B ) -based regimen require maintain intravenous access ( IV ) monitoring treat associated complication . The price acquire ampho B also prohibitive successful treatment . Cumulatively , treatment course ampho B neither cost effective administratively efficient , leave patient either untreated inadequately treat low-dose regimen fluconazole alone . Fluconazole widely available , inexpensive , give orally , demonstrate safety profile broad range dos , proven activity fungus cause CM , Cryptococcus neoformans . All factor make fluconazole potential treatment option wide range people . However , present recommend dosage , fluconazole expect successful 34 % 42 % patient . This rate low regimen combine fluconazole treatment include flucytosine ampho B . The purpose study evaluate whether high-dose fluconazole safe effective treatment CM 10 week . This study also collect information treat CM ampho B ( either alone another drug , either flucytosine fluconazole ) . For study , 168 HIV-infected people CM participate duration 24 week . This study proceed 2 stage stage may consist 4 step . Participants may take part one stage study . Stage 1 measure maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) fluconazole participant . Stage 2 purpose dose validation . Stage 1 study complete January 2014 . The two high dos fluconazole test Stage 1 ( 1600 mg/day 2000 mg/day ) test Stage 2 study . In Stage 1 , participant randomly assign receive either fluconazole ampho B-based regimen ( regimen either ampho B alone ampho B combination 5-fluorocytosine fluconazole , accord local standard care ) .Three dos fluconazole test , MTD find 2000 mg/day . The two high dos fluconazole test Stage 1 ( 1600 mg/day 2000 mg/day dos ) test Stage 2 study . Participants enrol Stage 2 randomly assign Step 1 receive treatment either fluconazole ( one 2 dos find safe Stage 1 ) ampho B-based regimen . After randomization Step 1 , participant either Stage 1 Stage 2 may enroll three additional step . In Step 2 , participant randomly assign receive ampho B-based regimen intolerant regimen ( experience treatment limit toxicity [ TLT ] ) receive fluconazole . Participants receive study-provided fluconazole Step 1 Step 2 may enroll Step 3 negative cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) culture . Participants Step 3 receive fluconazole ( low dose Step 1 Step 2 ) Week 10 . At Week 10 , participant enroll Step 4 receive low daily dose fluconazole ( i.e. , less received Steps 1 , 2 , 3 ) end study ( Week 24 ) . Participants stag begin treatment ampho B receive daily ampho B intravenously 2 week . Fluconazole give orally . Before enter study , potential participant attend screen visit CM diagnosis confirm CSF collect via lumbar puncture . HIV test also conduct , along clinical assessment , health medical history questionnaire . Participants also blood collection , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , pregnancy test ( applicable ) . Once accept study , participant answer question health medication history ; complete physical exam , blood collection , HIV testing , neurological exam , lumbar puncture , ECG ; may pregnancy test ( applicable ) . Participants study visit Weeks 1 ( Days 1 , 4 , 7 ) , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 24 , may extra visit individualize reason . Total study duration 24 week . Plasma , urine , serum , CSF sample collect participant store possible future use .</detailed_description>
