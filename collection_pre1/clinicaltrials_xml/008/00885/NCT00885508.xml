	<brief_title>A Study Efficacy Safety Lenalidomide Combined Escalating Doses Chemotherapy Intermediate-2-or High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) With Del 5q</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive lenalidomide combine DNR- AraC chemotherapy . The first 31 patient receive DNR 45 mg/m2/d , 3 day , AraC 200mg/m2/d CI 7 day . Progression next cohort DNR 60 mgm2/d x3d AraC 200mg/m2d x7d , contrary reduction lower cohort DNR 30 mgm2/d x3d AraC 200mg/m2d x5d decide inclusion fix number patient , review toxicity efficacy independent safety review committee ( SRC ) . Efficacy would define response rate ≥50 % . After inclusion first 31 patient , SRC choose cohort dose last 33 patient receive , base toxicity efficacy criterion . 1 . Induction treatment Lenalidomide 10 mg daily PO 3 week . DNR 30-45-or 60 mg/m2 /d ( depend cohort 3 day ( IV push ) - AraC 200mg/m2/d 5- 7 7 day ( continuous infusion ) + G-CSF ( lenograstim ) : 263 ug/d day 9 , recovery aplasia ( maximum 30 day ) . Evaluation perform recovery aplasia , day 40 late ( marrow aspirate karyotype ) . Patients hematological CR , CRi marrow CR proceed consolidation treatment : Once cohort dose decide SRC , second cohort 33 patient enrol 2 . Consolidation treatment ( patient achieve CR , Cri , marrow CR ) 6 monthly course : DNR ( daily dose require achieve CR ) day1 , combine AraC 60 mg/m2/12h SC 5 day give . Lenalidomide 10 mg/ first 2 week course . 3 . Maintenance treatment Lenalidomide 10 mg/d 2 week every month relapse ( dose reduce cytopenia ) In patient still respond 52 week , drug continue supply , follow death continue patient . SECOND PART OF THE TRIAL AFTER AMENDMENT Treatment schedule 2nd Part trial In dose level 4 , 20 patient receive lenalidomide 25 mg/d 21 day combine DNR- AraC chemotherapy ( DNR 60 mgm2/d x3d AraC 200mg/m2d x7d ) induction . During consolidation , patient receive Lenalidomide 25 mg/d 14 day , combine DNR 60 mgm2/d x1d AraC 60 mg/m2 x2/d x5d . finally , maintenance , patient receive Lenaidomide 25 mg/d x14d every month , relapse . Progression next cohort ( Lenaidomide 50 mg ) decide inclusion 20 patient , review toxicity efficacy independent safety review committee ( SRC ) ( Briefly , give median time reach ANC platelet &gt; 500 50000/mm3 , respectively 27 day previous trial chemotherapy alone ( Gardin , Blood ) , DLT would define great 3 10 patient recover level 40 day , occurrence unexpected grade III-IV non hematological toxicity ) . Efficacy would define response rate ≥60 % . In dose level 5 , 20 patient receive lenalidomide 50 mg/d 21 day combine DNR- AraC chemotherapy ( DNR 60 mgm2/d x3d AraC 200mg/m2d x7d ) induction . During consolidation , patient receive Lenalidomide 50 mg/d 14 day , combine DNR 60 mgm2/d x1d AraC 60 mg/m2 x2/d x5d . finally , maintenance , patient receive Lenaidomide 50 mg/d x14d every month , relapse .</detailed_description>
