	<detailed_description>Major cardiovascular adverse event patient heart failure treat cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT-D ) represent big concern medical community , require hospitalization may lead death . Subjects history heart failure counsel regard importance contacting clinician promptly experience change worsen condition . Acute heart failure episodes hospitalization represent one relevant cause health status deterioration patient . Moreover , atrial arrhythmia occurrence big issue , increase risk heart failure , stroke inappropriate shock . In addition affect patient health , hospital admission result complication impact healthcare cost . Latest generation Medtronic CRT-D device equip system trigger alarm possible fluid accumulation detect ( OptiVol ) . This may initiate patient-clinician contact evident cardiac decompensation . Moreover , advance diagnostic capability detect atrial arrhythmia occurrence total burden available device . Importantly , device able inform physician event remote monitor CareLink Network parameter , potential playing key role patient monitoring . Over last year , interest increase remote monitoring model deliver care HF patient , either telemonitoring ( transfer physiological data telephone digital cable home healthcare provider ) regular structure telephone contact patient healthcare provider , may may include data transfer . Several study relatively large number patient publish ( see table ) . A recent meta-analysis find remote monitoring program patient chronic HF living community reduce admission hospital cause mortality nearly one fifth improve health relate quality life , significant effect cause admission hospital . However , none publish study consider remote monitor system able provide device-detected information fluid accumulation , AT/AF total burden , arrhythmias occurrence device-related issue patient treat CRT-D device . Early intervention may key element avoid major cardiovascular event occur possible deterioration disease progression . The Carelink Network remote monitoring system , Care Alerts , may initiate subject-clinician contact typical sign symptom exhibit , since provide physician automatic alert atrial arrhythmia occurrence , fluid accumulation , system integrity issue . However , clinical evidence must provide superiority patient management strategy respect standard clinical practice , base routine in-office visit . Very recent finding show use CareLink European clinical practice technically feasible remote follow-up efficient method surveillance implant patient . Moreover , early detection review device clinical event suggest potential impact remote monitor overall patient care . There number possible limitation remote monitoring . The CareLink Network system require patient establishes initial contact device remote monitor unit , unit properly hook phone line . Not patient may able perform setup properly . There may delay physician consult patient data ( example weekend ) , risk adverse event occur interval . There may difficulty contact patient ( e.g . travel ) . These possible limitation need properly assess , especially monitor atrial arrhythmia , time factor importance avoid complication . Remote patient ' disease management potential avoid hospitalization . Clear demonstration remote monitoring AT/AF/HF plus strict treatment guideline lead reduction hospitalization rate proven , could major argument use technology routine clinical practice . The MORE-CARE Study aim compare two different strategy disease management heart failure patient treat CRT-D device : 1 . Remote disease management via Carelink Network system 2 . Standard disease management mean schedule routine in-patient follow-up . The main objective study demonstrate remote management strategy superior standard strategy , term clinical effectiveness total healthcare system utilization .</detailed_description>
