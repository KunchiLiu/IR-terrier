	<brief_summary>Gingivitis , define inflammation gingival tissue , long associate bacterial accumulation [ plaque ] tooth surface adjacent gingiva , cause inflammatory reaction . Experimental gingivitis health adult induce abstension brush teeth 9 21 day , test effect numerous chemotherapeutic agent , rinse toothpaste . Effective prevention plaque accumulation prevent destructive form periodontal disease . A recent link establish localized gingival inflammation systemic inflammation number disease process . Periodontal disease may lead elevate C-reactive protein [ CRP ] , consider potential risk factor cardiovascular disease stroke . It show reduce gingival inflammation accompany significant decrease serum CRP level . Naturopathic remedy treat oral disease well document medical dental literature since early civilization , become popular recent year . We propose study one remedy , PERIORINSE . This remedy consist number herb , show exhibit antibacterial anti—inflammatory effect . Specifically , show block proteolytic effect see gingival inflammation . This study evaluate efficacy formulation , use currently accept clinical testing protocol . A Random sample 100 healthy volunteer fulfill inclusion criterion exclusion criterion , include study . Patients randomly select one 4 treatment group : PERIORINSE ( n=25 ) , CPC ( Cepacol ) mouthwash ( 25 patient ) , Listerine mouthwash ( n=25 ) , placebo ( colored water ) mouthrinse . Patients examine baseline , Gingival Index take teeth . A blood specimen take measure CRP level well . Patients give full dental prophylaxis include scale tooth polish , give rinse instruction remind cease oral hygiene method include brushing , flossing , rinse rinse period 14 day . On day 14 , patient re-examined Gingival Index take teeth . Patients give full dental prophylaxis include scale tooth polish require reinstitute original oral hygiene regimen . CRP level measure , well .</brief_summary>
