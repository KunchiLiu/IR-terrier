	<brief_summary>- Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) frequently apply therapy chronic pain . Although evidence regard effectiveness TENS chronic pain inconclusive many patient continue use TENS long term daily practice . An important question therefore patient respond well others n't . In chronic pain evidence abnormal pain processing ( sensitization ) find several patient group . The process sensitization might influence effectiveness TENS theoretical work mechanism TENS base modulation transmission nociceptive impulse form peripheral receptor throughout spinal nerve system brain . In study want study effect TENS pain transmission , measure contact heat evoke potential ( CHEPS ) , 'responders ' non-responders ' two week TENS treatment . 'Responders ' define patient pain reduction ≥ 30 % VAS two week treatment period TENS . Non-responders patient pain reduction &lt; 15 % . - Objective : ) Is pain reduce effect TENS responder base modulation pain transmission perception , measure CHEPS ? b ) Is ability TENS modulate pain transmission perception influence abnormal pain processing ? - Prospective cohort study - Patients chronic non specific pain ( duration &gt; 6 month ) , 18 year , include . Patients refer Pain Clinic University Hospital Maastricht ( MUMC ) . Exclusion criterion : ) pain due cancer , b ) use cardiac pacemaker , c ) pregnancy , ) neurological sensory deficit , e ) language and/or cognitive inability complete health assessment questionnaires f ) previous TENS pain relief . - Patients receive two week treatment period TENS-treatment , regular , home instruction . The frequency set 100 Hz pulse duration 250 μ sec . Patients use TENS daily ( minimal 4 time day 30 minute ) . Main study parameters/endpoints decrease amplitude CHEPS responder versus non-responders .</brief_summary>
