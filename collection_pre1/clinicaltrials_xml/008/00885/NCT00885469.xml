	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : - PillCam™ ESO-2 demonstrate equivalent accuracy parameter compare blind esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) detect suspect Barrett 's esophagus , detect grade esophagitis . - PillCam™ ESO demonstrate safety parameter compare EGD - PillCam™ ESO-2 demonstrate well patient 's satisfaction compare EGD</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PillCam® ESO 2 Esophageal Pathologies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper endoscopy ( EGD ) employ diagnose BE ; however , cost invasiveness diagnostic tool limit utilization many patient ( 17 ) . There need alternative , simple , less invasive diagnostic tool evaluate GERD patient screen BE . Esophageal capsule endoscopy ( ECE ) novel technique offer non-invasive evaluation esophageal pathology gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) patient . The potential benefit screen patient Capsule Endoscopy ( CE ) several . Detection esophageal pathology CE could select subgroup patient upper endoscopy avoid risk cost upper endoscopy majority . Other benefit include convenience , ability perform test outpatient basis le 30 minute , patient acceptability , minimal loss work time , safety , tolerability , ability non-physicians screen patient , potentially , improve compliance screening recommendation . Recently , new , high resolution capsule ( ESO 2 ) large field view good illumination previous CE introduce . A simplified ingestion protocol CE improve visualization Z-line also report well ( 17 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient age 18 year old Patient know suspect suffer esophageal disease base his/her medical history recent symptom suggestive GERD BE Patient agree sign Informed Consent Form Currently take PPI least 28 day . Patient dysphagia Patient know Zenker 's Diverticulum Patient know suspect suffer esophageal and/or intestinal obstruction Patient cardiac pacemaker implant electro medical device Patient undergone EGD within past seven day Female patient pregnant and/or lactate Patient expect undergo Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) examination within 7 day ingestion capsule Patient prior pelvic abdominal surgery gastrointestinal tract ( uncomplicated procedure would unlikely lead bowel obstruction base clinical judgment investigator appendectomy uncomplicated cholecystectomy ) Patient condition precludes compliance study and/or device instruction Patient suffers life threaten condition Patient currently participate another clinical study Patient medication may coat esophagus iron sulcrafate . Contraindication radiation barium ( e.g. , sensitivity allergy ) require confirm excretion capsule necessary . Patient currently suffer condition like allergy , illness ( flu ) anything else cause congestion , excessive salivation , etc . could foster difficulty swallow capsule affect clarity CE image . Contraindicated use laxative , surgery require remove capsule e.g. , colonoscopy .</criteria>
