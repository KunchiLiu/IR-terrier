	<detailed_description>Background : Patients human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection high incidence recurrence rate pneumonia bacteremia cause Streptococcus pneumoniae compare person without HIV infection . Before introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , rate invasive pneumococcal bacteremia 100-fold great HIV-infected patient compare HIV-negative control . Since introduction HAART 1996 , incidences several AIDS-related opportunistic infection significantly decline . However , incidence invasive pneumococcal disease HIV-infected patient receive HAART still 35~60-fold high non-HIV infect adult . The pathogenesis invasive pneumococcal disease may relate decrease IL-8 level . By multivariate analysis , major risk factor pneumococcal bacteremia HIV-infected patient include age , close exposure child , associate comorbidity , smoking , alcohol abuse , inject drug use , prior hospitalization , CD4 count low 100 cells/ul ; protective factor include HAART use pneumococcal vaccination . The 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV ) recommend HIV-infected adolescent adult CD4 lymphocytes count &gt; /= 200 cells/ul optional person CD4 lymphocytes count &lt; 200 cells/ul . Revaccination one time also consider initial vaccination give CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/ul CD4 count increase &gt; 200 cells/ul result HAART . In follow year , several study demonstrate 23-valent PPV vaccination associate decrease risk invasive pneumococcal disease . However , HIV-infected patient HAART therapy significantly low magnitude antibody responses 23-valent PPV receive HAART HIV-uninfected person , antibody titer among HIV-infected patient seem associate CD4 count . In addition , though rate decline mean antibody concentration HIV-infected patient non-HIV-infected individual similar 5 year vaccination , consequence low postvaccination antibody concentration HIV-infected patient , HIV-infected patient antibody concentration protection level within 3 year vaccination . The impaired immune response PPV may due PPV T-lymphocyte-independent type 2 antigen ( TI-2 antigen ) instead T-lymphocyte-independent type 1 antigen ( TI-1 antigen ) . The response TI-2 antigens dependent number function T lymphocytes induction antibody response . Once T-lymphocyte 's function impair , subsequent antibody response also compromise . Therefore , long-lasting immunity PPV seem limited HIV-infected patient . The US Food Drug Administration approve 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine ( PCV ) 2000 . It contain seven S. pneumoniae polysaccharide combine carrier protein non-toxic mutant diphtheria toxin . With combination , induce T-cell dependent immune response memory T B cell enhance good secondary antibody response contact pathogen revaccination . Several study demonstrate 7-valent PCV-primed patient higher antibody response also induce well opsonophagocytic activity old immunocompromised patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia , liver transplantation , allogeneic stem cell transplantation . In HIV-infected patient , efficacy 7-valent PCV also associate CD4 count antibody response opsonophagocytic activity still well induced PPV vaccination . However , 7-valent PCV vaccination schedule necessity booster vaccination still unknown . In addition , long-term immunity 7-valent PCV correlation CD4 count also investigation . The goal study compare quantitative functional antibody responses 1-dose 7-valent PCV 2-doses 7-valent PCV HIV-infected patient , also compare response HIV-infected patient different category CD4 count . Materials Methods : Study population 350 HIV-infected adult recruit infectious disease clinics National Taiwan University Hospital . Persons age 18 year great HIV infection document enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) Western Blot test eligible . Persons follow criterion exclude : immunization PPV within past 5 year ; current pregnancy , use another investigational drug within past 4 week ; use intravenous immunoglobulin within last 3 month , vaccination within past 2 month . Persons CD4 count less 100 cells/ul highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) exclude . Based CD4+ lymphocyte count within 3 month pneumococcal vaccination , vaccinee randomly select , three category patient define : - Group 1 : patient CD4+ &lt; 200 cells/ul ; - Group 2 : patient CD4+ 200-350 cells/ul group 3 CD4+ &gt; 350 cells/ul . After receipt 7-valent PCV , patient continue routine follow-up outpatient clinic antiretroviral therapy relate HIV care . Plasma HIV RNA load quantify use Cobas Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor test ( Cobas Amplicor version 1.5 , Roche Diagnostics Corporation , IN ) low detection limit 40 copies/mL , CD4+ lymphocyte count determine use FACFlow ( BD FACS Calibur , Becton Dickinson , CA ) . The CD4+ lymphocyte count plasma HIV RNA load monitor every 3 month . HAART define combination least 3 antiretroviral agent contain two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) plus protease inhibitor ( PIs ) one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) ; triple NRTIs . Vaccine administration Hepavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine ( Wyeth-Lederle ) contain 2Î¼g capsular polysaccharide six serotypes ( 4 , 9V , 14 , 18C , 19F , 23F ) 4ug capsular polysaccharide serotype 6B covalently link total 20~25 ug CRM197 , non-toxic mutant diphtheria toxin . After receipt single 0.5 ml injection 7-valent conjugated pneumococcal vaccine , patient prospectively follow 48 week . Sequential blood specimen collect patient return routine examination plasma HIV RNA load CD4+ lymphocyte count every 3-6 month . The blood specimen store -70 degree Celsius determination anti-capsular antibody titer perform . The study approve Institutional Review Board hospital , every patient give write informed consent . All patient sequentially enrol two-phase study accord vaccination dos : group 1 : two dos PCV 4 week apart ; group 2 : one dose PCV . Vaccine administrate study nurse via intramuscular deltoid injection . Adverse event Subjects give questionnaire record adverse event since vaccination 7 day . They also advise call study nurse severe side effect . Severe adverse reaction ascertain interview subject telephone hospitalization suggest . Specimen collection determination anti-capsular antibody titer Blood drawn 0 , 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 week separate clot blood sample centrifugation store -70 degree Celsius . The determination anti-capsular antibody level among serially collect blood specimen enrol patient carry ELISA follow method describe previously minor modification . Briefly , 1 mL serum mix 10 mg CWPS ( cell wall polysaccharide ) incubate room temperature rock platform 30 min . Sera patient AIDS antibody S. pneumoniae serotypes 14 , 19F , 23F , 6B capsule &lt; 1 ug antibody CWPS per mL use negative control . Capsular polysaccharide S. pneumoniae serotypes 14 , 19F , 23F , 6B obtain American Type Culture Collection ( ATCC ) . These capsular polysaccharide suspend phosphate-buffered saline ( PBS , pH7.4 ) concentration 10 ug/mL use directly coat well incubation 4 degree Celsius overnight . After wash , block do PBS contain 1 % bovine serum albumin 4 degree Celsius overnight . Duplicate sample sera study 2-fold serial dilution , laboratory reference standard serotype contain known amount IgG reactive specific capsular polysaccharide include plate positive control . Following washing , first antibody incubation perform 37 degree Celsius 2h . After thorough washing unbounded antibody well , Horseradish Peroxidase ( HRP ) -conjugated goat antibody human IgG ( ZYMED LABORATORIES INC , South San Francisco , CA ) 1 : 2,000 dilution use detect IgG , reaction develop 10 min dark addition K-blue substrate ( Neogen Corporation , Lexington , Ky. , USA ) , follow add 1N sulfuric acid stop reaction . All washing incubation do PBS buffer contain 0.05 % Tween 20 . Optical density read ELISA reader ( SpectraMAX 340 , Molecular Devices , Sunnyvale , CA ) wavelength 450 nm , subtraction optical density appropriate blank . Significant antibody response define 2-fold great increase antibody level follow vaccination compare baseline ( responder ) . The laboratory staff perform determination antibody response blind identity clinical characteristic patient , vaccination status , whether HAART initiate . Opsonophagocytic assay ( OPK assay ) OPK titer S. pneumoniae measure describe minor modification . Briefly , differentiate HL-60 cell use effector/target cell ratio 400/1 . 20 ml 2-fold serially dilute , 56 degree Celsius heat inactivate , serum sample aliquoted well 96-well microtiter plate . 20 ml S. pneumoniae bacterial suspension ( ~103 cfu/well ) add plate incubate 37 degree Celsius 5 % CO2 atmosphere 15 min . Following incubation period , 10 ml rabbit complement ( Dynal Biotech Inc. , Lake Success , NY ) add well . Then , 40 ml ( 4x105 cells/well ) wash , differentiate HL-60 cell immediately add well . The assay plate incubate 37 degree Celsius 45 min horizontal shaking ( 220 rpm ) . The plate keep ice stop reaction . A 5 ml aliquot well plat onto agar medium plate . Plates incubate overnight 37 degree Celsius 5 % CO2 atmosphere viable colony count well . Typically , 10-60 colony expect . The OPK titer express reciprocal serum dilution &gt; /=50 % kill compare growth complement control well . Serum sample titer &lt; 8 report titer 4 analysis level serotype-specific IgG , exclude analysis correlation level IgG HIV-1 viral load serum OPK titer . Quality control serum ( serum know titer ) add plate blind test sample OPK titer examine titer quality control serum identical . Statistical analysis All statistical analysis perform use SAS statistical software ( Version 8.1 , SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC , U.S.A. ) . Categorical variable compare use 2 Fisher 's exact test whereas non-categorical variable compare use Wilcoxon 's rank-sum test . Univariate analysis follow multivariate analysis perform identify factor associate 2-fold great increase antibody responses either one three select serotypes follow-up 5 consecutive year . All test two-tailed p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Implications study : 1 . If anticapsular IgG response OPK significantly high compare 23-valent pneumococcal vaccination , routine vaccination 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine suggest patient HIV infection . 2 . Anticapsular IgG response OPK compare one dose two dos group . Vaccination dose suggest accord result .</detailed_description>
