	<brief_title>The Effects Short Arc Banding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multifidus muscle well know document segmental spinal stabilizer postural muscle . ( Bajek , Bogduk ) Previous study show evidence patient low back pain ( LBP ) present multifidus muscle atrophy . It document patient present unilateral back pain demonstrate ipsilateral state reduce cross sectional area lumbar multifidus ( LM ) segmental level injury pain . ( Barker , Hides ) Chronic LBP sufferer demonstrate localize segmentally specific decrease cross sectional area multifidus . ( Hides ) It theorize multifidus muscle surround chronically painful degenerative segment less able stabilize spine segment , predispose chronic LBP patient exacerbation due inability cope demand day day life . ( Bajek ) Rehabilitative Ultrasound Imaging ( RUSI ) verify accurate reliable determine cross sectional area lumbar multifidus ( Hides ) . The interrater intrarater reliability RUSI show high utilize standardize protocol . ( Hides ) Measurement LM contraction use RUSI show valid useful measure determine activation LM correlate EMG . ( Kiesel ) RUSI correlate MRI gold standard measure CSA LM . ( Hides ) Type I muscle fiber predominant muscle fiber type lumbar multifidus lead researcher pursue spinal stabilization exercise focus isometric contraction . These intervention stimulate mainly Type I muscle fiber use speed load parameter theorize necessary stimulate Type II fiber . ( Rissanen , Ng ) Previous study Rantanen examine LM fiber type post surgery low back . Patients good recovery ( minimal symptom 5 year surgery ) show increase Type II muscle fiber type relation poor recovery Type I fiber increase . ( Rantanen ) Limited mobility might account decrease diameter Type II fiber patient undergo lumbar surgery . Notably , Type I muscle fiber appear increase size presence chronic LBP . This probably due chronic pain induce low tension muscle spasm . ( Mattila , Rantanen ) Stokes suggest LM take increase role spinal stability due atrophy muscle , thus increase size Type I fiber versus Type II . To date , effect short arc fast tapping exercise band resistance short arc banding ( SAB ) cross sectional area multifidus document literature . Short arc band novel exercise treatment knowledge first study mode exercise . Using fast motion band resistance hope reach threshold necessary stimulate type I muscle fiber predominate LM , also type II muscle fiber . From literature , type II muscle fiber decrease cross sectional area presence segmental spinal lesion lumbar disc herniation . Type II muscle fiber multifidus aid spine respond stabilize ballistic load . Since modern man much sedentary , lumbar spine load adequately produce stimulation maintain size Type II muscle fiber</detailed_description>
