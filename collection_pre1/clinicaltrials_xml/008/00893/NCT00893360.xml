	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether give cardiosphere-derived stem cell ( CDCs ) patient decreased heart function and/or large amount damage muscle heart attack safe . CDCs cell grow small biopsy sample take heart . Giving patient CDCs investigational procedure approve Food Drug Administration study . In addition determine whether treatment safe , study also examine whether decrease amount heart muscle damage and/or improve heart function heart attack . The amount heart muscle damage function heart directly affect prognosis ( predicted course disease ) , development heart failure complication patient experience heart attack . By way background , scientist physician believe , year ago , heart muscle damage heart attack could replace . Recently , however , scientist discover new heart muscle form , regenerate , process enhance ( increase ) administration large number certain cell isolated heart bone marrow . These cell stem cell , cell derive stem cell , may achieve benefit form new heart muscle cell , become heart muscle cell , release substance increase ability already exist stem cell form new heart muscle . All study conduct far experimental cell type approve routine clinical care patient heart disease . However , study involve bone marrow stem cell indicate small improvement heart function one large study demonstrate decrease clinical event group receive bone marrow cell . Investigators study decide study CDCs come person 's body , therefore foreign immune antigen may reject . Since cell come person 's heart , likely form heart tissue . In addition , animal study indicate safety problem cell capable form heart muscle blood vessel cell heart attack . The investigator study whether true human .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The type study propose call prospective , randomize , dose escalation study . This mean patient receive solution contains cell patient receive conventional medical treatment . The ratio 2:1 , mean twice many patient receive cell receive conventional medical treatment . The first 6 patient group randomize receive study drug dose 12.5 million cell conventional medical treatment . The remain 18 patient randomize receive study drug dose 25 million cell conventional medical treatment . The DSMB evaluate unblinded AE data ( include SAEs ) first six patient enrol receive cell discharge . There two study site . Each site enroll 15 participant . The total number subject 30 , approximate 20 % attrition rate . Subjects refer participate study physician care . The target number participant 24 patient open artery inject stem cell whose biopsy tissue grow 12.5 million cell . If reason cell expand 12.5 million subject 's artery open enough allow proper injection , subject replace study population 24 patient continue follow . This mean subject undergo test , procedure ( except cell infusion ) follow-up visit would otherwise require participation study . When subject determine eligible study , protocol review subject informed consent obtain physician participating study prior test treatment . This study conduct Cedars-Sinai Medial Center The Johns Hopkins Hospital . The total length subject 's participation study approximately 14 month , enrollment 12 month follow-up visit . SCREENING PHASE - Participants undergo screen evaluation . A physical examination medical history perform include medication review well alcohol drug use . A blood specimen obtain , approximately three teaspoon , assess blood count , chemistry , HIV , hepatitis pregnancy test female childbearing age . An MRI scan perform determine whether portion heart biopsy would obtain damaged heart attack . MRI also detect cardiac tumor present . An electrocardiogram perform assess heart 's electrical activity . Additionally , compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen pelvis perform detect exist cancer tumor . If test positive , subject able participate study . RANDOMIZATION - After screen visit complete , subject randomize either cell infusion conventional medical therapy . Randomization 2:1 , mean twice many subject randomize receive cell infusion conventional medical therapy . Conventional medical therapy heart attack include beta blocker , aspirin , diuretic , cholesterol lower agent , anticoagulant , ACE inhibitor calcium channel blocker enrollment cardiac rehabilitation program . Depending degree heart damage 's affect patient 's heart rhythm , patient may eligible pacemaker implantable cardioverter-defibrillator . The specific medical management determine patient 's primary care physician cardiologist . BASELINE VISIT- At visit several test perform assess heart 's baseline function , i.e. , function cell infuse . It conduct prior biopsy . These include completion questionnaire much activity subject perform ; blood study measure blood count function liver kidney ; electrocardiogram measure electrical activity heart ; exercise test also measure blood pressure , heart rate , electrocardiogram , amount oxygen carbon dioxide exhale air ; test measure much distance subject walk six minute ; test lung function ; record heart 's rhythm 48 hour ; MRI provide information baseline function recovery heart since myocardial infarction . BIOPSY PHASE - For subject randomize receive stem cell , biopsy heart perform catheterization laboratory . In test , small amount tissue remove internal lining heart . A long , flexible tube ( catheter ) , call bioptome , insert vein thread right side heart . Most often catheter thread jugular vein neck local anesthesia . The tip catheter fit tiny jaw allow doctor take small snip muscle microscopic examination . The doctor take 5-10 small piece heart tissue right side wall separate right side heart leave side heart . This used grow cell four week period . Blood pressure vital sign status monitor several hour follow procedure . An electrocardiogram ; blood ( approximately 15 cc 3 teaspoon ) obtain measure blood count , kidney liver function ; urine specimen urinalysis collect . An echocardiogram perform patient leaf hospital determine whether instrument obtain biopsy cause hole wall biopsy obtain . INTRACORONARY INFUSION PHASE - During phase , subject randomize receive cell bring cardiac catheterization laboratory undergo cardiac catheterization procedure similar angioplasty perform treat heart attack . However , rather angioplasty , cell inject coronary artery whose blockage responsible heart attack . The cell infuse balloon catheter inflate previously implant stent . There new stent implant unless felt clinically necessary . Following procedure , subject remain hospital 24 hour time laboratory study , include cardiac enzyme rule cardiac injury , heart attack , well ECG monitoring perform . The subject release hospital ask wear ECG record device 48 hour . FOLLOW UP VISITS - For subject enrol study , six follow-up visit . This necessary obtain compare information set study participant . Additionally , necessary obtain information determine safety cell infusion whether decreased amount heart damage , improve blood flow function heart portion heart receive cell . A history physical perform 6 visit , ask subject side effect may medicine take . Additionally , study staff perform electrocardiogram , obtain blood urine study measure blood count kidney liver function , obtain 48-hour record subject 's electrocardiogram . During six twelve month visit , cardiac MRI scan also perform measure amount heart damage blood flow function heart ass portion heart receive cell . It also determine whether tumor form heart . At visit , also test lung function , six-minute walk test , question much activity subject perform . Additionally , exercise test include measure heart rate , blood pressure , electrocardiogram , amount oxygen carbon dioxide exhale air . Patients receive implantable cardio-defibrillator study cardiac CT instead MRI . The patient follow study total 12 month baseline visit unexpected effect study report hospital 's institutional review board , study data safety monitor board FDA , appropriate , depend severity adverse event .</detailed_description>
