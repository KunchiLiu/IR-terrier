	<brief_summary>A small , pilot study consist twelve participant subacute ( 6-12 month post-stroke ) chronic stroke ( 1year+ post-stroke ) living around Columbia area . The twelve participant randomly select participate either unilateral ( one-handed ) task training ( 6 participant ) bilateral ( two-handed ) task training ( 6 participant ) SaeboFlex orthosis . Each group undergo six assessment establish pre-testing baseline qualification , follow training session , four-week combine home clinic program , post-testing determine change affect arm use function . The hypothesis two-handed training effective one-handed training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bilateral Versus Unilateral Task Retraining Using SaeboFlex Orthosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SaeboFlex device mechanical orthosis promote grasp release functional movement upper limb impaired movement due stroke . Many researcher find incorporate affect unaffected limb together exercise ( bilateral task training ) result increase functional use affect limb compare performing exercise affect limb . Therefore , want determine bilateral task train effective unilateral task training use SaeboFlex device subacute chronic stroke rehabilitation . For unilateral training group , exercise complete affected hand use Saebo device . For bilateral group , Saebo affect hand , device unaffected hand , arm exact movements/exercises time . The participant videotape photographed move ball without device , device start study , device midway study , end study . This do purpose provide participant feedback regard progress report outcomes upon completion project . Faces omit photographic medium request participant , participant may decline photographic medium time without withdraw study .</detailed_description>
