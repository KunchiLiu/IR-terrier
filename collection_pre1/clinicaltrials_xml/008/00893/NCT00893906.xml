	<brief_summary>Influenza , highly communicable acute respiratory disease , one major infectious disease threat human population . In Africa , information occurrence influenza disease burden seriously lack . Such data would important determine contribution influenza two million annual pneumonia death among child globally , mostly develop world , potential number death could prevent influenza vaccination . A single dose trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) 70 90 percent effective prevent influenza healthy old child young middle-aged adult , less efficacious young child elderly . Young child suffer substantial influenza morbidity unlikely pre-existing immunity receive two dos TIV provide adequate immunity . Because family study influenza transmission conduct 1970 's find child main introducers influenza household , vaccination child may decrease chance spread influenza contact . Mass vaccination schoolchildren correlate reduced respiratory illness unvaccinated person suggest immunization child large scale affect community epidemic . In temperate industrialized country seasonal disease , influenza vaccine give annually , prior influenza season , generally target individual high risk severe disease . Influenza prevention strategy may need differ tropical develop country due variety reason . Given vary influenza circulation pattern , unknown hemisphere vaccine formulation provide year-round protection diverse strain may exist tropical country . Persons reside develop country also may nutritional deficiency underlie disease infection affect vaccine immunogenicity . Consideration must give programmatic issue well . Adolescent adult preventive health service poorly develop many country , thus strategy target child may feasible option . In addition , vaccinate child may cost-effective option , potential provide direct benefit vaccinate , well indirect benefit unvaccinated member population . Thus , influenza vaccine effectiveness study tropical develop country population help elucidate burden seasonal influenza may inform optimal use vaccine either seasonal pandemic situation . Thus , study Senegal evaluate direct effect TIV reduce occurrence laboratory-confirmed influenza among child receive well potential indirect effect experience population result reduce transmission among child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The trial take place study area Niakhar demographic surveillance system Senegal , population representative rural impoverish Africa . Villages randomize TIV beneficial control vaccine—inactivated polio vaccine—and child 6 month 10 year age target vaccination . Four hundred child enrol immunogenicity safety substudy measure immune response vaccination ass detail reaction adverse event vaccines population . For evaluation effectiveness , passive active surveillance conduct identify laboratory-confirmed influenza among enrolled child population live . Such surveillance also allow determination rate influenza description clinical characteristic disease African population . With epidemiologic data , national global public health official well data develop future influenza control strategies either seasonal pandemic influenza .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A male female child least 6 month age old 10 year age ( yet reach 11 year age ) enrollment visit . A child whose parent guardian 's primary residence , time study vaccination , village compound select receive TIV IPV . Subject 's parent legal guardian willing provide write informed consent prior subject 's first study vaccination . Hypersensitivity active substance component either TIV ( include egg protein ) IPV . ( Please see information composition vaccine . ) Hypersensitivity previous administration influenza polio vaccine . Acute severe febrile illness . ( Administration TIV IPV postpone recovery . Minor illness , mild upper respiratory infection , without low grade fever , reason postpone vaccination . Acute severe febrile illness temporary exclusion . ) Any condition , opinion investigator , would pose health risk participant interfere evaluation study objective .</criteria>
