	<brief_title>An Intervention Program Reduce Risk Persistent Symptoms After Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although majority patient mild traumatic brain injury ( MTBI ) experience complete recovery within three month , sizeable group continue report frequent severe symptom headache , fatigue , difficulty concentrating , forgetfulness , irritability , label persistent post-concussion syndrome ( PCS ) . Persistent PCS associate vocational , recreational , social disability . Early education reassurance ( treatment usual ) effective general , appear insufficient subgroup . Recent research identify risk factor persistent PCS , include inaccurate illness belief , maladaptive cop behaviour , emotional distress . The present study evaluate additive efficacy cognitive-behavioural therapy protocol design modify risk factor , treatment usual . Participants MTBI recruit within six week injury . Those identified at-risk persistent PCS base evidence-based criterion receive treatment usual randomly assign receive either intervention cognitive-behavioural therapy . We hypothesize group receive cognitive-behavioural therapy few PCS symptom less disabled follow-up . We also hypothesize compensation-seeking status mitigate improvement illness belief , cop behaviour , emotional distress mediate improvement . A blinded rater conduct baseline outcome assessment .</detailed_description>
