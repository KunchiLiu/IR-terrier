	<brief_summary>The purpose study observe potential benefit moderate physical activity use bed mount cycle hemodialysis treatment session inflammatory marker blood patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Moderate Physical Activity Hemodialysis Patients Reduce Inflammation ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients ESRD chronic hemodialysis patient frequently elevate marker inflammation ( e.g. , serum CRP value ) accumulation proinflammatory monocyte population circulation . The level inflammation highly predictive cardiovascular disease mortality . Physical activity show improve dialysis efficacy improve elimination retention solute . In healthy individual , sport activity influence inflammatory immune parameter . The study observe influence moderate physical activity ( use bed mounted cycle 30min dialysis thrice weekly ) circulate monocyte subpopulation inflammatory protein 9 month period 16 chronic hemodialysis patient .</detailed_description>
