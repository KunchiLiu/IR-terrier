	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) chronic progressive respiratory disorder cause disability increase burden patient , family health service . Treatment COPD patient depend stage disease . COPD respond poorly corticosteroid , spite inflammation major component pathogenesis . A major barrier therapy COPD resistance anti-inflammatory effect corticosteroid . The molecular mechanism corticosteroid resistance elucidate , particularly molecular basis anti-inflammatory effect corticosteroid well understood ( 12 ) . An important mechanism corticosteroid resistance COPD , also link amplification inflammatory process , reduction critical nuclear enzyme histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) 2 . Since major change level small airway . We examine effect addition theophylline product stable COPD patient treat combined inhaler inhale corticosteroid .</brief_summary>
