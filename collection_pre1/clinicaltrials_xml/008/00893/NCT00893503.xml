	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer major public health concern Alberta . Colorectal Cancer fourth common diagnose cancer second overall term cancer death Canada . One 14 male 1 16 female age 50-74 diagnosed colorectal cancer overall 1 28 chance die colorectal cancer . While colorectal cancer surgically curable diagnose early stage , five year survival rate 90 % versus 10 % detect advanced stage , le 20 % individual age bracket traditionally undergone colorectal cancer screening . Colorectal cancer often present non-specific symptom non-cancerous polyp commonly find . If polyp leave place , may grow time progress non-cancerous mass symptomatic cancerous tumor ; therefore , early screening patient without symptom may thereby prevent progression non-cancerous cancerous finding . The hypothesis , theory study SCOPE Pilot research study , implementation colorectal screening program would decrease colorectal cancer prevalence , increase long-term survival ratio patient , decrease burden health care system . Moreover , early detection treatment colorectal cancer potential increase lifespan patient decrease health care cost . The SCOPE Pilot Research study recruit 1000 individual age 50 - 74 average high risk develop colorectal cancer determine refer Gastroenterologists . Those patient age 40-50 also eligible personal family history colorectal cancer . Patients refer SCOPE Pilot program screen eligibility , exclusion criterion present , invite attend education session research program . The SCOPE Pilot research study compare current fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT - Hemoccult II ) newly available FOBT blood test along colonoscopy therapy . It also encompass educational information , risk stratification , screen average high risk patient , colonoscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Scope Pilot Research Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Capital Health Region , 18.6 % colorectal cancer detect stage 1 , 22.4 % already stage IV . The Capital Health Region 340,000 individual age 50-74 , yet 14.3 % receive colorectal cancer screen . These low screening rate may attribute lack awareness , limitation fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT ) unpleasant association FOBT colonoscopy . The limitation FOBT include low sensitivity detection adenoma small cancer , cumbersome method stool collection multiple day dietary restriction , make patient compliance low introduce high probability false positive test unnecessary colonoscopy . Currently , two screen modality available . The fecal occult blood testing ( FOBT : Hemoccult II ) detect blood stool may due colonic adenoma cancer . The second colonoscopy , gold standard detect colorectal lesion ; however carry risk bleed bowel perforation . FOBT recommend primary screening tool patient average risk develop colorectal cancer . Large population-based randomize controlled trial consistently demonstrate significant survival benefit patient undergo annual biannual screening FOBT . Recently , new generation FOBT technique , FOBT immunochemical ( FIT ) become available . These test sensitive detect specifically human blood stool require dietary restriction . Recent study suggest diagnostic performance FIT may superior standard Hemoccult II rate simplify sample . As well , economic analysis suggest use FIT superior FOBT diagnostic performance reasonable cost European population . A urine specimen also obtain analyzed metabolomics subject . Metabolomics study global chemical composition organism . It utilizes technology nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy study metabolite / chemical composition , interaction , change level response disease environmental factor . By analyze urine sample , possible identify metabolite pattern characteristic various disease . In addition , metabolite pattern liver disease caused cirrhosis hepatitis , inflammatory bowel disease cancer identify . Urine metabolomics analysis may offer new sensitive , yet inexpensive screen tool colorectal cancer .</detailed_description>
