	<brief_summary>This study observational prospective pilot trial utilizes finger cuff non invasive hemodynamic monitoring ( NexfinHD Monitor ) assess 4 different group ( CHF/COPD , Trauma , Sepsis , Stroke ) patient arrival Emergency Department document change see hemodynamics acute therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Non Invasive Hemodynamic Cardiovascular Monitoring Evaluate Emergency Department Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There little early ( Emergency Department presentation ) hemodynamic monitor acutely ill injured patient secondary lack non invasive technology could reliably apply patient population.Thus assessment hemodynamics make physician clinical information include intermittent pulse blood pressure measurement . It know underlie continuous cardiac output , systemic vascular resistance , etc patient change current Emergency Medicine therapeutic intervention . Currently available finger cuff devise ( NexfinHD Monitor , BMEYE , Amsterdam ) measure hemodynamics beat beat basis easily apply acutely ill individual . This prospective pilot study 48 patient ( 4 group 12 ) document hemodynamics patient arrival continuously 2 hour , blind treat physician . Treating physician ask estimate hemodynamic parameter various time point . The study characterize hemodynamics patient , compare estimate treat physician determine whether predict need life save intervention .</detailed_description>
