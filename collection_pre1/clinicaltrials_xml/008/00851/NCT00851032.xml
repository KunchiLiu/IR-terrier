	<brief_summary>Primary Objective The primary objective study establish program molecular profiling patient advance cancer , goal ( 1 ) provide comprehensive characterization molecular profile individual patient ( 2 ) correlate molecular profile response phase I therapy . Specimens receive LAB07-0817 ( Tissue Bank ) protocol Department Investigational Cancer Therapeutics . Note study consider umbrella protocol systematically enroll phase I patient molecular profile analysis correlate result treatment outcomes . The IMPACT trial treatment protocol . Secondary Objectives 1 . To characterize advanced cancer delineate genetic mutation , amplification , translocation , define molecular patient characteristic . 2 . To assess antitumor effect treatment tumor response use World Health Organization ( WHO ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria and/or clinical benefit , include progression-free survival overall survival , demonstrate phase I clinical trial . 3 . To correlate molecular profile patient evidence antitumor activity ( complete remission , partial remission , prolong stable disease , overall survival ) define subset patient respond specific therapy clinical trial novel agent . 4 . To correlate molecular profile toxicity induce investigational agent define subset patient may may candidate treatment agent future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prognosis patient advance metastatic malignancy poor , median survival , irrespective diagnosis , approximately 8.8 month ( 95 % confidence interval , 7.4 10.9 month ) . In recent year increase interest novel agent . Elucidating molecular basis advance cancer lead development potentially curative strategy disease aim specific molecular genetic aberration characteristic specific tumor . This study molecular profiling analyse patient ' store sample involve minimal risk subject . Subjects minimal risk leftover blood , tissue , patient data use study , patient data keep confidential .</detailed_description>
