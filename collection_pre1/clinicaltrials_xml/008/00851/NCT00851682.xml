	<brief_summary>The purpose present study find MRI technique examine ( 1 ) motion water molecule prostate ( diffusion sensitive MRI ) , ( 2 ) difference blood flow prostate ( dynamic contrast enhance MRI ) , ( 3 ) difference chemical composition prostate ( MR spectroscopy ) , use detect prostate cancer early non-invasively . Localization cancer within prostate would particular importance focal cryoablation prostate carcinoma hope improve result project . Additional aim study correlate expression gene believe pay role prostate cancer MRI finding .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radical prostatectomy patient undergo MRI prior schedule surgery . Ex vivo image do prostate remove . Results final pathology compare result image determine accuracy image analysis cancer localization stag . Brachytherapy patient undergo MRI prior schedule procedure . Two area suspect cancer two area without suspected cancer prospectively identify base MRI image . At time brachytherapy , transrectal needle biopsy obtain previously identify area . The needle core review study pathologist determine accuracy image analysis cancer localization stag .</detailed_description>
