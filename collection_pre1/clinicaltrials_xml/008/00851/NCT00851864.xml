	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Therapeutic Anticoagulation With Tinzaparin During Pregnancy Via Weight-based Dosing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physicians Calgary Health Region use tinzaparin ( predominantly ) low molecular weight heparin ( LMWHs ) treatment venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) pregnancy . The recent anticoagulation guideline American College Chest Physicians ( ACCP ) suggest heparin level ( anti-Factor-Xa activity level ) may do periodically pregnancy determine need adjust dose LMWH pregnancy progress . This monitoring widely practice . There clear consensus literature , however , expert suggest initial subsequent dosing may do base weight alone ( do non-pregnant population ) . Given multiple physiologic change occur drug metabolism pregnancy , bear evaluation . To date , limited data weight-adjusted dosing LMWH pregnancy . This study therefore design determine dose tinzaparin pregnancy base weight , periodic weight-based adjustment , result adequate therapeutic anticoagulation .</detailed_description>
