	<brief_summary>The purpose study see creatine , naturally occur chemical body , effective treat Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) female teenager . Creatine may effect interest brain . The reason MRI component study learn new way see inside brain . The investigator use magnetic field radio wave look brain chemical brain . The investigator hope technique medial use future . The primary hypothesis study oral creatine supplementation beneficial effect adjunctive therapy female adolescent MDD non-responders adequate trial SSRIs Fluoxetine Escitalopram .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Creatine Treatment Female Adolescents With Depression Who Are Non-Responders Fluoxetine Escitalopram</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label clinical trial investigational drug creatine , augmentation treatment female adolescent Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) fail respond first-line treatment Fluoxetine Escitalopram . Widely use high school college athlete U.S. , creatine over-the-counter nutritional supplement annual sale $ 200 million . Studies animal show creatine improves performance female rat Porsolt Forced Swim test , use predict efficacy antidepressant compound . Human neuroimaging study indicate patient MDD abnormal level high-energy phosphate metabolite brain , primarily adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) phosphocreatine . Research also show creatine supplementation induces change high-energy phosphate metabolite associate positive response antidepressant . For propose study , ten female adolescent age 13-18 MDD recruit participation open-label trial creatine . Participants depression unremitted MDD despite treatment Fluoxetine dose &gt; 40mg daily &gt; 4 week Escitalopram dose &gt; 10 mg daily &gt; 4 week . Depressed participant treat oral creatine 4gm daily eight week , continue take Fluoxetine Escitalopram prescribed . In addition , ten healthy control participant history psychiatric substance abuse disorder recruit . No treatment administer control participant . The primary outcome measure Children 's Depression Rating Scale ( CDRS-R ) , use Treatment Adolescents Depression Study ( TADS ) clinical trial ( March et al. , JAMA 2004 ; 292 ( 7 ) :807-20 ) Treatment Resistant Depression Adolescents ( TORDIA ) study ( Brent et al. , JAMA 2008 ; 299 ( 8 ) :901-13 ) . All study participant undergo brain scan baseline six week , 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 31P-MRS ) . The brain scan used measure high-energy phosphate metabolite Anterior Cingulate Cortex ( ACC ) , anatomical region brain implicate MDD . 31P-MRS non-invasive neuroimaging technique expose participant radiation . At magnetic field strength utilized ( 3T ) , magnetic resonance image FDA-approved known adverse effect . The research team use data 31P-MRS scan compare level high-energy phosphate metabolite MDD participant vs. healthy control . In addition , comparison pre- post-treatment metabolite level conduct MDD participant . The primary hypothesis study oral creatine show efficacy augmentation treatment female adolescent MDD whose depression respond Fluoxetine Escitalopram . Secondary hypothesis include follow : adolescent treatment-resistant MDD show difference baseline healthy control high-energy phosphate metabolite ACC ; brain scan depressed adolescent respond creatine show normalization high-energy phosphate metabolite ACC .</detailed_description>
