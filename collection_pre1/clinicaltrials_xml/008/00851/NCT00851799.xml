	<brief_summary>The U.S. Department Health Human Services ( HHS ) guideline recommend HIV-infected people never receive anti-HIV therapy treat triple drug regimen ( commonly call combination antiretroviral therapy , cART ) . Since introduction cART , morbidity mortality among HIV-infected patient dramatically reduce . However , metabolic , skeletal , cardiovascular disease increasingly report among HIV-infected patient may attributable , part , direct effect cART . Much understanding development disease , risk factor , consequence disorder derive clinical study HIV-infected person receive old antiretroviral agent . A5260s design examine contribution HIV-disease related factor impact new antiretroviral drug development metabolic ( blood vessel , blood sugar , cholesterol ) , skeletal , cardiovascular disease people never receive anti-HIV therapy . A5260s prospective substudy phase III randomize clinical trial A5257 ( see ClinicalTrials.gov identifier : NCT00811954 ) . A5257 design look different combination anti-HIV drug contain medication efavirenz ( EFV ) well drug combination work decrease amount HIV blood allow immune system recovery people never receive anti-HIV therapy . A5257 also examine drug tolerability safety various drug combination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A5260s optional , metabolic substudy phase III , prospective , randomized clinical trial ( A5257 ) . For complete detail parent study A5257 , please see ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00811954 . Some participant study A5257 ask participate substudy A5260s . Not participant ask since A5260s take place subset A5257 sit . Participants agree participate substudy A5260s enrol time enrollment A5257 . No intervention give part A5260s , A5260s participant underwent blood draw , self-administered questionnaire response ( related physical activity body image ) , ultrasound scan measure thickness carotid artery neck brachial artery flow mediate dilation arm , computerize topography ( CT ) dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan measure bone mineral density body fat . The duration A5260s study 2 3 year ( 96 144 week ) , depend participant enrol . The study design enroll total 330 participant least 110 per group ; group represent different randomized drug combination define assign main study A5257 . Cohort A : Atazanavir ( ATV ) + Ritonavir ( RTV ) + Emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) Cohort B : Raltegravir ( RAL ) + FTC/TDF Cohort C : Darunavir ( DRV ) + RTV + FTC/TDF All participant ask return A5260s clinic visit week 4 , 24 , 48 96 144 participate clinical evaluation . No clinical evaluation restrict subset A5260s participant . If participant choose discontinue participation substudy , participant able continue study A5257 . However , participant discontinue participation A5257 also remove A5260s . Additionally , participant 's decision discontinue switch study drug main study impact participation follow-up clinic visit A5260s .</detailed_description>
