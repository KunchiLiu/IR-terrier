	<brief_summary>Herpes zoster , shingle , result viral infection cause painful skin rash , usually old people people suppress immune system like infected HIV . The ZOSTAVAX vaccine show reduce number infection symptoms herpes zoster infection people age 60 . The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity two dos ZOSTAVAX HIV-1-infected adult conserve immune function ( Cd4+ T cell count &gt; =200 cells/uL ) virologically suppress potent combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) cause herpes zoster ( HZ ) , shingle , associate painful skin rash post-herpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) . The incidence severity HZ PHN increase immune function decrease , elderly HIV-infected people . The live VZV vaccine , ZOSTAVAX , show reduce incidence severity HZ PHN people age 60 . The main purpose study determine whether two-dose regimen ZOSTAVAX safe well-tolerated HIV-infected individual conserve immune function . This study two stage two arm . It may last 24 week per subject . In Stage 1 , 48 participant CD4 cell count 200 cells/uL enrol ( 24 participant CD4 count 200 349 cells/uL 24 participant CD4 count equal 350 cells/uL ) . These participant randomize 3:1 receive two dos ZOSTAVAX placebo least six week apart . If certain safety criterion meet Stage 1 , enrollment open Stage 2 . Stage 2 enroll approximately 352 subject CD4+ T cell count &gt; = 200 cells/uL . In Stage 2 , participant stratify use parameter Stage 1 randomize 3:1 receive either two dos vaccine placebo accord schedule . Participants follow least 42 day vaccination . Temperatures collect daily 42 day follow vaccination . Telephone contact also make 2 3 day vaccination 24 week follow initial vaccination obtain information regard vaccination-related symptom . All participant 6 8 study visit . At screen visit , documentation HIV status require , blood urine collection , physical exam , medical history , clinical assessment occur . At visit , target physical exam occur . At visit , blood urine collection , clinical assessment occur . Antiretroviral medication provide study .</detailed_description>
