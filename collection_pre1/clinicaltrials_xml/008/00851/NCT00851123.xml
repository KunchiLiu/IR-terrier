	<brief_title>Modified Constrained - Induced Movement Therapy Compared Intensive Bimanual Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed description : Constrained-Induced Movement Therapy seem efficacious treatment approach certain subgroup patient moderate mild hemiparesis stroke . Still remain unclear whether train intensity restriction well arm play big role . CIMT mCIMT usually compare standard care lower intensity constraint well arm , treatment focus functional ( task-specific ) train hemiplegic arm . Bimanual training , imply training activity require use arm , may however , even effective mCIMT , provide training similar intensity . The purpose study : 1 . To compare functional effect mCIMT bimanual training equal intensity order examine one treatment approach superior regard regain motor ability . 2 . Based fMRI scan subgroup patient , examine whether cortical reorganization stroke differs depend type treatment receive ( mCIMT v bimanual training ) . 3 . To examine rationale implement new treatment approach primary- secondary health care , thereby contribute improved coordination specialist municipal health care system . Patients group participate 4 week training program , either mCIMT bimanual . In group cognitive technique use increase adherence . The patient examine screen , intervention , 3 month complete intervention .</detailed_description>
