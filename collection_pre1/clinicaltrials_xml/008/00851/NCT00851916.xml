	<brief_summary>The purpose study scientifically evaluate effect ( good bad ) new type radiation treatment patient locally recurrent prostate cancer prior radiotherapy . The treatment know prostate radiosurgery , distinguish traditional radiotherapy application small , precisely control margin around area target full dose radiation , far few treatment , use much large dose per treatment . This research do see advantage , , prostate radiosurgery may salvage treatment method , include brachytherapy , cryosurgery , high intensity focus ultrasound ( HIFU ) , hormonal therapy radical prostatectomy .</brief_summary>
