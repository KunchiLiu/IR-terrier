Inappropriate use antibiotic case lead resistant strain bacteria community . Evidence show almost 50 % antibiotic prescription unnecessary.As half antibiotic prescription ARI necessary since infection viral respond antibiotic therapy source resistance community . To address issue investigator conduct randomized , double blind placebo control clinical trial oral Amoxicillin versus placebo child non-severe pneumonia take account necessary safety precaution well .

	<brief_title>Trial Amoxicillin Compared With Placebo Pneumonia Children Aged 2-59 Months</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pneumonia one major cause childhood morbidity mortality develop country . Burden acute respiratory infection ( ARI ) high estimate 5-7 episode 5 population every year result 2 million death . However , due severe bacterial pneumonia . In order reduce pneumonia related death community qualify personnel diagnostic facility often available WHO develop management guideline base simple clinical sign follow empirical treatment . All child cough fast breathe classify management category : Children fast breathe classify non-severe pneumonia require oral antibiotic home , child low chest indrawing /or general danger sign ( GDS ) classify severe pneumonia , severe pneumonia respectively . Both group require referral hospital injectible antibiotic therapy . These guideline show effectively reduce ARI related mortality 34 % ( ? ) communities successfully implement . However , certain concern regard guideline . It felt use sign fast breathe alone prescribe antibiotic may judicious thing public health perspective may lead spread antibiotic resistance . Fast breathing could due many cause related pneumonia . There many factor affect respiratory rate I child . Children fever elevate respiratory rate case . Although WHO guideline recommend respiratory rate must count child afebrile , calm preferably sleep . In real life practice always possible . Another issue child cough fast breathing wheeze . In many develop country wheeze commonly associate fast difficult breathing . Data develop country show wheeze common viral bacterial infection . Likewise , data develop country show virus , especially respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) , isolate frequently bacteria child episode acute low respiratory tract infection . A randomized trial infant bronchiolitis pneumonia find difference clinical outcome child antibiotic compare placebo ( ref ? ) . Wheeze long unaddressed one major cause overuse antibiotic . Evidence show three cycle inhale bronchodilator find associate significant decrease respiratory rate lead revise classification `` pneumonia '' child . It convincingly show majority child continue well send home without antibiotic . Though fast breathing important indicator clinical diagnosis pneumonia distinguish viral bacterial pathogen Controversy still exist concern relative importance viral bacterial pathogen reliable distinction bacterial viral infection yet establish issue raise lot question programme manager , senior researcher technical expert , still need answered . Many child `` non-severe pneumonia '' ( cough fast breathe ) neither clinical pneumonia assess physician pneumonia chest radiograph . Inappropriate use antibiotic case lead resistant strain bacteria community . Evidence show almost 50 % antibiotic prescription unnecessary . As half antibiotic prescription ARI necessary since infection viral respond antibiotic therapy source resistance community . When resistant bacteria become common , may begin see treatment failure child severe pneumonia really require effective antibiotic . It imperative knowledge likely cause pattern pneumonia could utilize good understand model antibiotic resistance . For stated reason , need elaborate role antibiotic child cough fast breathing . To address issue conduct randomize , double blind placebo control clinical trial oral Amoxicillin versus placebo child non-severe pneumonia take account necessary safety precaution well . The primary objective determine whether child age 2 59 month cough fast breathing , without wheeze , evidence WHO define severe illness , equivalent clinical failure 72 hour therapy treat Amoxicillin compare placebo .</detailed_description>
