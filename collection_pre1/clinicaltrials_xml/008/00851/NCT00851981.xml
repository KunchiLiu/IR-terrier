	<brief_summary>Background : Alcoholic liver disease one important cause chronic liver disease country . There currently treatment chronic alcoholic liver disease abstinence . Hepatic methionine metabolism abnormal patient one consequence depletion S-adenosylmethionine ( SAMe ) level , affect numerous important cellular process . SAMe increasingly utilized treatment liver diseases although protective mechanism remain unclear . A recent randomized double-blind trial use SAMe patient alcoholic liver disease find improvement 2-year survival less advanced liver disease . However , important change methionine metabolism histological change include study . Aim : The goal study determine effect SAMe administration key metabolic abnormality methionine cycle recovery alcoholic liver disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized , Controlled Trial S-adenosylmethionine Alcoholic Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : This randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled trial . Thirty patient stable alcoholic hepatitis ( Maddrey Score &lt; 32 ) without cirrhosis meet entry criterion receive either 400 mg SAMe ( n=15 ) placebo ( n=15 ) three time day duration one year . History , physical assessment , various blood test liver biopsy perform prior treatment . Patients repeat blood test subsequent follow-up visit every month first two month , every two month thereafter . They also encourage abstain alcohol visit . A post-treatment liver biopsy obtain end trial . The primary outcome parameter include serum homocysteine , SAMe TNFalpha level , expression key hepatic enzyme methionine cycle hepatic SAMe glutathione level . Histological progression alcoholic liver disease , clinical biochemical index liver disease , quality life assessment also examine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must chronic alcohol user , define history ethanol consumption average &gt; 40g/day woman 60g/day men least 1 year inclusion . The presumptive diagnosis alcoholic hepatitis : recent binge drinking ; compatible physical finding ( one : jaundice , enlarge liver , hepatic bruit , abdominal pain , loss appetite , nausea ) ; compatible biochemical profile ( moderate elevation AST ALT , elevate total serum bilirubin ) ; liverspleen colloid scan suggestive reticuloendothelial redistribution hepatic arterialization . The diagnosis alcoholic hepatitis must confirm liver biopsy , show typical feature acute sclerosing hyaline necrosis 70 . The degree portal fibrosis determine liver biopsy , grade accord Knodell scoremodified Ishak 71 must less equal 5 possible score 6 , 6 indicate cirrhosis . The alcoholic hepatitis must `` stable '' , i.e . require treatment either pentoxifylline 72 prednisone , Maddrey Score 73 { ( PTpatient PTcontrol ) x 4.6 + TBmg/dL } &lt; 32 . Patients must willing participate trial , remain abstinent alcohol , compliant treatment regimen , undergo posttreatment liver biopsy . Patients either compensated cirrhosis ( biopsy proven ) clinical picture severe cirrhosis define Child 's class C and/or recent history ( within one month ) decompensated liver disease ( history ascites , encephalopathy variceal bleed within one month trial entry ) . These patient reduce life expectancy one year often severely coagulopathic biopsied . Patients severe acute alcoholic hepatitis poor prognosis define Maddrey Score &gt; 32 . These patient mortality rate 50 % hospitalization period untreated either prednisone pentoxifylline . Patients receive hepatotropic treatment colchicine , penicillamine , corticosteroid , ursodeoxycholic acid , pentoxifylline . Patients receive know hepatotoxic longterm treatment NSAIDs , statins , neuroleptic , certain anticonvulsive medication , highdose acetaminophen . Patients suspect hepatocellular carcinoma . Patients contraindication liver biopsy . Patients liver biopsy yield sufficient specimen analysis . Patients untreated deficiency folic acid , vitamin B6 B12 . Patients chronic active Hepatitis B C , hemochromatosis , autoimmune hepatitis , cholangiopathy . Patients psychotic disorder , particular manic depression ( contra indication SAMe treatment ) .</criteria>
