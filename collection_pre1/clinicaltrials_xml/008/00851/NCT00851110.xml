	<brief_summary>Objectives study : This randomized multicenter phase II study compare tolerability , toxicity quality life two high-dose chemotherapy regimen base cyclophosphamide , thiotepa carboplatin . Regimen A : full dose CTC . Regimen B : two course CTC ( tCTC ) 33 % dose reduction . Primary endpoint : - Maximum degree non-hematological toxicity . Secondary endpoint : - Total number hospital day . - Quality life evaluation follow high-dose chemotherapy ( 1 year ) . - Effect therapeutic dose monitoring CTC tCTC . Trial design : This investigation multicenter prospective randomize phase II study . Patients eligible study identify mastectomy wide tumor excision axillary clearance . Following randomization , patient receive four course cyclophosphamide , epirubicin fluorouracil ( FEC ) . Patients early progressive disease time take study . The first chemotherapy course must give soon possible surgical procedure , preferably within 3 week , later 6 week since primary surgery . After third fourth FEC course G-CSF administer peripheral stem cell harvest . All radiation therapy ( include radiation therapy administer part breast conserve strategy ) must postpone chemotherapy conclude . Questionnaires , comprise Rotterdam Symptom Checklist ( RSCL ) Short-Form General Health Survey ( SF-36 ) send mail randomization , chemotherapy , 3 month thereafter , every l/2 yr till least 1 year follow-up perform earlier . [ 6 , 28 , 29 ] . All patient randomize initiation chemotherapy . - The 'standard ' treatment arm include 4 course FEC follow high-dose chemotherapy single course full dose CTC follow peripheral stem cell reinfusion . Subsequently , conventional external beam radiotherapy breast chest wall regional lymph node area include axilla parasternal area administer follow guideline individual center . Patients hormone receptor positive disease go receive 5 year tamoxifen . Patients receptor positive disease enter menopause advise undergo ovarian ablation well . - The 'experimental ' treatment arm identical 'standard ' one , except single course CTC replace 2 course tCTC follow peripheral stem cell reinfusion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>High-dose chemotherapy alkylating agent combination CTC appear add significantly efficacy conventional dose chemotherapy patient high-risk breast cancer , provide HER-2/neu gene amplify tumor . As high-dose chemotherapy regimen , CTC associate significant toxicity [ 31,32 ] . Although high-dose alkylating therapy seem effective , virtually nothing know dose-response curve combination ( detailed discussion see classical paper E. Frei III [ 32 ] . If one assume efficacy increase level increase dose , efficacy tCTC might almost great CTC , considerably less toxicity . In addition , two closely spaced course tCTC might increase efficacy regimen . There suggestion double transplant may effective single one , multiple myeloma Ewing sarcoma . A similar suggestion also make breast cancer ( study Nitz et al ref 4 , table 1 ) .</detailed_description>
