	<brief_title>Examining Role Vitamin D Asthma Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma COPD among lead cause illness child adult , respectively . Asthma common long-term disease among child develop world , approximately 16 million people United States COPD , fourth common cause death country . Vitamin D , nutrient hormone , take diet exposure sunlight . Many child adult vitamin D deficiency concern current recommend intake level may inadequate . A vitamin D deficiency cause immune system dysfunction may increase risk develop immune-mediated disorder , multiple sclerosis , inflammatory bowel disease , rheumatoid arthritis , various cancer .

This study examine previously collect blood sample participant three study . There study visit specifically study . The three study include follow : - Childhood Asthma Management Program , study examine use inhaled corticosteroid , nedocromil , placebo child mild-to-moderate asthma - Genetic Epidemiology Asthma Costa Rica , ongoing study identify genetic predictor asthma Costa Rican family asthma - Normative Aging Study , study age conduct men live Boston</detailed_description>
