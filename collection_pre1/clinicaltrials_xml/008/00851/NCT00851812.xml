	<detailed_description>Fatigue frequently report side effect cancer treatment . Fatigue related cancer treatment different fatigue occur situation specific cause identify . Exercise may may improve type fatigue . The purpose study examine cancer treatment impact normal lifestyle physical activity pattern participation physical activity , well ability walk progressive resistance exercise program reduce cancer-related fatigue breast cancer patient . This study also examine walk progressive resistance exercise program improve factor quality life , depression , anxiety , ability sleep , self esteem , cardiovascular fitness , energy expenditure , muscular strength , muscle mass , immune function ( measured inflammatory cytokine ) .</detailed_description>
