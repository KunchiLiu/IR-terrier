	<brief_summary>Synacthen® synthetic analogue ACTH use since 1960s assess adrenal sufficiency . It well establish first line test investigate diseases hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis assess adrenal function patient long-term corticosteroid therapy . Briefly , cortisol measure injection 250 microgram Synacthen® . In normal individual serum cortisol rise concentration great arbitrary value ( typically 550 nmol/l ) 30 minute administration Synacthen® . In 2004 All Wales Clinical Biochemistry Audit group survey protocol perform interpret short Synacthen® test . This identified wide difference practice within Wales . As result standard draw performance test . It note considerable variability bias cortisol immunoassays cortisol cut-off choose interpretation short Synacthen® test method dependent . Clark et al. , 1998 report cortisol cut-offs follow Synacthen® use 4 well establish commercially available cortisol immunoassay . This study demonstrate considerable difference cortisol immunoassay use clinical laboratory time . It also apparent difference gender-related response Synacthen® although dependence age . In 8 year since publication study advance formulation cortisol immunoassay well instrumentation use perform analysis . At University Hospital Wales cortisol currently assay use Bayer Centaur automate immunoassay analyser . This assay available time study Clark et al. , . The investigator ' current short Synacthen® test cut-offs therefore rely historical reference range become outdated . A re-evaluation cortisol cut-off required ensure patient incorrectly classify . It long recognise oestrogen ( include ethinyloestradiol prescribe combined oral contraceptive pill ) increase total ( free ) serum cortisol level . The degree increase relate dose use thought due elevation cortisol bind globulin ( CBG ) . However , comparison total serum cortisol response Synacthen® perform woman take oestrogen . Knowledge salivary cortisol response may also useful patient decrease serum CBG concentration e.g . severe nephrotic syndrome serum cortisol response may mislead . The investigator therefore plan measure salivary cortisol part investigator ' study protocol assess response free cortisol . 17 Hydroxyprogesterone ( 17OHP ) intermediate biosynthesis cortisol . Deficiency 21-hydroxylase enzyme activity lead increase concentration 17OHP peripheral circulation . The short Synacthen® test use assist diagnosis mild case congenital adrenal hyperplasia . Current reference range take literature .</brief_summary>
