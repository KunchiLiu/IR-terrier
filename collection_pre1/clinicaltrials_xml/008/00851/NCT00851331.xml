	<brief_summary>Epilepsy frequent neurological disease childhood , characterize recurrent seizure sometimes major effect social , behavioral cognitive development . Childhood focal epilepsy particularly age-related disease mainly occur developmental critical period . A complex interplay brain development maturation process susceptibility gene may contribute development various childhood epileptic syndrome associate language cognitive deficit . Indeed , Landau-Kleffner syndrome ( LKS ) , continuous spike-and-waves sleep syndrome ( CSWS ) , benign childhood epilepsy centrotemporal spike ( BCECTS ) benign rolandic epilepsy , different syndrome consider part single continuous spectrum disorder . While genetic component three syndrome remain elusive , novel high throughput genome analyzes could bring interesting insight possible genetic defect pathophysiological mechanism underlie link various disorder associate epilepsy speech cognitive impairment .</brief_summary>
