	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study EGCG/Tocotrienol 18 Patients With Splicing-mutation-mediated Cystic Fibrosis ( CF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) autosomal recessive disorder cause mutation CF trans-membrane conductance regulator protein . Despite substantial progress achieve understanding molecular basis physiopathology CF , cure available . Mutation specific therapy novel approach overcome molecular defect CF . We previously show gentamicin PTC 124 induce read-through nonsense CFTR mutation , lead functional CFTR . In addition show vitro treatment ( - ) epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) Tocotrienol cell harbor splice mutation augment production full-length transcript affect protein . Working hypothesis aim : EGCG tocotrienol act genetic modifier increase level correctly splice CFTR transcript . Aim : To determine CF patient oral administration EGCG and/or Tocotrienol , modify CFTR splicing , assess ( 1 ) Transepithelial Potential Difference ( TEPD ) measurement ion channel activity , ( 2 ) level correctly splice CFTR mRNA nasal mucosa , ( 3 ) cytokine level sputum ( 4 ) pulmonary function ( FEV1 ) . Methods : Patients CF carry splice mutation treat EGCG 200 mg/day , Tocotrienol 600mg/day 28 day cycle . Clinical parameter ( TEPD , FEV1 cytokine level sputum ) molecular parameter ( mRNA level , ) analyze determine effectiveness treatment . Expected result : In vitro study cell culture derive CF patient show positive result ; therefore improvement TEPD indication CFTR expression . An increase mRNA level change FEV1 , cytokine level confirm result . Importance : Genetic therapy encounter many technical difficulty . It therefore importance develop alternative molecular strategy lead improvement cure genetic disease . Probable implication Medicine : Alternative splicing mechanism common cause genetic disease ~15 % know human mutation result defective pre-mRNA splicing . Therapies base augmenting level full length fully functioning protein may substantial impact treatment patient genetic disease .</detailed_description>
