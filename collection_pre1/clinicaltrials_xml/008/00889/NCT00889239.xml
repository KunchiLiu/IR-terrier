	<detailed_description>High strength ceramic use dentistry construct fix partial denture . Their advantage acceptable fracture resistance , excellent biocompatibility , moderate opacity , etc . Because increase demand esthetic restoration , various ceramic material use core material several all-ceramic system . Their property investigate extensively many vitro study . Currently , much result regard clinical performance wear mechanism ceramic-based prosthesis information require future research .</detailed_description>
