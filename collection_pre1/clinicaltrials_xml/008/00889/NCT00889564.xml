	<criteria>1 . 21 year age old . 2 . Male nonpregnant female . 3 . Life expectancy less 1 year . 4 . ESRD hemodialysis poor remain venous access site creation AV fistula placement graft upper extremity . 5 . Implant side central venous system surgeon believe access interventional device accommodate 19 Fr GVAS device . 6 . Potential GVAS target brachial artery â‰¥ 3 mm diameter determine suitable measure . 7 . Ability understand provide write informed consent . 8 . Willing able cooperate followup examination . 1 . Documented history drug abuse within six month prior enrollment . 2 . `` Planned '' concomitant surgical procedure previous major surgery within 30 day , exclude vascular access related procedure . 3 . Currently treat another investigational device drug . 4 . Known bleed diathesis hypercoaguable state . 5 . Peripheral white blood cell count 1.5 K/mm3 platelet count 50 K/mm3 . 6 . Degenerative connective tissue disease , e.g. , Marfan 's Ehlers Danlos Syndrome . Subjects Lupus Erythematosus may enrol receive immunosuppressant low dose prednisone ( &lt; 10 mg/day orally ) . 7 . Subjects know suspected concomitant active bacterial , fungal , viral , parasitic infection . Subjects Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C may enrol . Subjects HIV + CD4 count &lt; 200 exclude . Subjects bacteremia within past six ( 6 ) week must negative blood culture one week complete appropriate antibiotic therapy prior enrollment . 8 . Severe underlying comorbidity immediate lifethreatening condition . 9 . Subjects condition , opinion investigator , could preclude evaluation response completion followup affect subject safety . 10 . Subjects significant arterial occlusive disease would preclude safe placement upper extremity hemodialysis access . 11 . Subjects history finding physical examination suggest significant arterial insufficiency could affect patient safety and/or device performance extremity plan use GVAS ( i.e. , steal syndrome , hand ischemia , peripheral arterial vascular disease , etc. ) . 12 . Subjects schedule kidney transplant within next 12 month . 13 . Subjects history superior vena cava syndrome exclude unless induce previous access ( subject enrol ) . 14 . Subjects history decrease cardiac output ejection fraction &lt; 20 % and/or NYHA class III IV . NYHA definition : Class III Subjects mark limitation activity ; comfortable rest ; Class IV Subjects complete rest , confine bed chair ; physical activity bring discomfort symptom occur rest . 15 . Subjects history uncorrected hypotension systolic blood pressure routinely &lt; 100 mg Hg . 16 . Subjects currently pacemaker ICD central venous system side GVAS device would implant .</criteria>
