	<brief_summary>Background : - A leukodystrophy disease affect white matter brain . The white matter conduct electricity one part brain . If insulation , myelin , damage , brain electrical pathway work properly . Researchers try identify cause leukodystrophy . Objectives : - To collect detailed clinical characterization , include history , physical examination , biochemical test , genetic study , neurophysiologic neuroimaging study patient unclassified leukodystrophies comprehensively characterize patient obtain comparative clinical profile . - To collect detailed clinical characterization , include history , physical examination , biochemical test , genomic proteomic tissue , neurophysiologic neuroimaging study patient know leukodystrophies investigate underlying pathogenesis disorder . - To good understand leukodystrophies unknown cause identify part DNA patient leukodystrophy cause problem . Eligibility : - Any individual know suspected leukodystrophy eligible participate protocol , include - Patients white matter disease unclassified unknown cause , include limited leukoencephalopathies calcification , leukoencephalopathies cyst , leukoencephalopathies hypomyelination , leukoencephalopathies brainstem involvement . - Parents sibling subject . - Exclusion criterion include patient ill travel Clinical Center patient leukoencephalopathy felt secondary acquire cause ( example , traumatic infectious ) . Design : - Patients see either inpatient outpatient depend test plan . Patients may need stay Clinical Center 3 5 day . - The following test conduct part standard clinical care : - Physical neurological examination , include blood urine test . - Magnetic resonance base study produce picture patient brain ( general anesthesia ) . - Spinal tap measure chemical spinal fluid ( general anesthesia young child ) . - Nerve biopsy , peripheral nerve affect , muscle biopsy , cell call mitochondrion muscle involve ( general anesthesia ) . - The following study may perform part participation research : - Blood , urine , spinal fluid , muscle understand protein , DNA , molecules tissue . - Skin biopsy grow ( culture ) skin cell analyze skin microscopically . - DNA study find new gene responsible leukodystrophies well understand disease . - Participation base interest help research leukodystrophies . Specific information patient present future health risk may gain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Genetic white matter disorder ( leukodystrophies ) estimate incidence 1:5000 live birth . As many 50 % patient white matter disease remain undiagnosed conventional neuroimaging , biochemical genetic testing , therefore unclassified leukodystrophies . Moreover , mechanisms disease many leukodystrophies know cause poorly understood : many systemic abnormality manifest white matter . The purpose study : ( ) define novel homogeneous group patient leukodystrophy work toward find cause disorder ( b ) establish disease mechanisms select classified leukodystrophies . In order achieve goal , patient leukodystrophy analyzed clinical , neurophysiological , biochemical genetic mean . For goal ( ) , patient would diagnose unclassified leukodystrophy know cause leukodystrophy outside center . At Clinical Center , patient undergo series neuropsychological , blood , urine , spinal fluid , radiological , peripheral tissue pathological test . Some test part standard battery others tailor individual patient . For goal ( b ) , select leukodystrophies define genetic cause select mechanistic study , use clinical laboratory tool establish increase understanding underlying pathophysiology . It hop present study help clarify nosology leukodystrophies significantly advance understanding pathogenesis disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients white matter disease unclassified unknown cause , include , limited leukoencephalopathies calcification , leukoencephalopathies cyst , leukoencephalopathies hypomyelination leukoencephalopathies brainstem involvement . Parents siblings subject EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients meet criterion ill travel clinical center . In case , consideration give enrol collection medical record sample . Patients meet criterion , leukoencephalopathy felt secondary acquire cause , example traumatic infectious .</criteria>
