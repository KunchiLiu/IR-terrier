	<brief_summary>Speech develop co-structuring auditory motor representation , especially first year life language acquisition . In present study , test mean functional magnetic resonance image whether vowel perception production might depend coordination auditory motor , articulatory , cortical map . The outcome study lead well understand whether vowel perception production process human brain provide important insight brain-language relationship . Besides new theoretical perspective speech perception production , project might raise important question concern patient speech disorder identify aspect speech perception production functionally link .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study explore functional neuroanatomy vowel processing . To aim , investigate neural basis attentive auditory perception production natural French vowel use functional magnetic resonance imaging . More specifically , compare vowel vary along give phonetic feature dimension keep feature characteristic constant . The phonetic feature test roundedness ( rounded/unrounded vowel ) , place articulation ( front/back vowel ) height ( close , close-mid , open-mid vowel ) . Our study pose three specific question . First , exactly human brain perceptual motor segregation different vowel category accomplish ? Second , stimulus dimension implement topographically orthogonal manner , vary orthogonally natural speech ? Most specifically , one would expect topographic segregation two vowel category ( e.g. , front v back vowel ) auditory motor cortex characterize widely distinct acoustic articulatory value . Third , possible sound-related topographic activation auditory motor cortex overlap vowel perception production ? This latter result would support functional coupling speech perception production system .</detailed_description>
