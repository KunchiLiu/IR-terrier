	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Intermittent Continuous OSI-906 Weekly Paclitaxel Patients With Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Cancer ( Other Solid Tumors )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase 1 dose escalation portion establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) patient advance solid tumor . Once recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) establish schedule , phase 2 study begin . Patients relapsed/recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer randomize 1:1:1 3 treatment group .</detailed_description>

( patient must measurable disease accord RECIST v1.1 ) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) 0 1 Predicted life expectancy ≥ 12 week Patients may prior therapy , provide follow condition meet : Chemotherapy : Prior chemotherapy must complete least 3 week prior study enrollment ( 6 week mitomycin C , nitrosoureas highdose carboplatin [ ≥ 600 mg/m² ] 4 week investigational drug 1 . Patient recover drugrelated toxicity ( exception grade 1 neuropathy alopecia ) 2 . Phase 1 : While limit number prior regimens patient enter phase 1 portion , prior taxane therapy must administer 3 week schedule 3 . Phase 2 : Patients must receive prior chemotherapy , must contain platinum taxanes point . Any prior taxanes therapy must administer 3 week schedule . A maximum 2 prior chemotherapy regimen permit . Patients must refractory radiologically confirm computerize tomography ( CT ) scan progressive disease ( PD ) chemotherapy ) resistant ( radiologically confirm CT scan PD within six month complete chemotherapy ) last platinumcontaining chemotherapy regimen Radiation : Patients may prior radiation therapy provide recovered acute , toxic effect radiotherapy prior registration/randomization . Radiated lesion choose target lesion . A minimum 21 day must elapse end radiotherapy registration/randomization study unless radiation affect less 25 % bone marrow Surgery : Previous surgery permit provided adequate wound healing occur prior registration/randomization Fasting glucose ≤ 150 mg/dL ( 8.3 mmol/L ) Adequate hematopoietic , hepatic , renal function define follow : Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 10 ^9 /L platelet count &gt; = 100 x 10^9/L ; Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) ; AST and/or ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN &lt; = 5 x ULN patient document liver metastasis ; Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Female patient must either : Of non childbearing potential : 1. postmenopausal ( define least 1 year without menses ) prior Screening , 2. document surgically sterile status post hysterectomy ( least 1 month prior Screening ) Or , childbearing potential : 1. must negative urine pregnancy test Screening , 2. must use two form birth control ( one must barrier method ) start Screening throughout study period 28 day [ 5 half life , whichever long ] final study drug administration Female patient must breastfeed Screening study period 28 day [ 5 half life study drug whichever longer ] final study drug administration Female patient must donate ovum start Screening throughout study period 28 day [ 5 half life study drug whichever longer ] final study drug administration Patients must provide verbal write informed consent participate study Diabetes mellitus currently require medication ( eg , insulin oral hypoglycemics ) During phase 2 portion , patient histology abdominal adenocarcinoma unknown origin diagnosis borderline ovarian tumor Previous concurrent malignancy ( exclude curatively treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) unless patient remission least 3 year History significant cardiovascular disease unless disease wellcontrolled .

Patients atrial fibrillation control medication exclude . Patients mean QTcF interval ≥ 450 msec screening exclude Use drug know risk cause Torsade de Pointes ( TdP ) risk cause QT interval prolongation within 14 day prior Day 1 dose prohibit Use potent CYP1A2 inhibitor ciprofloxacin fluvoxamine .
