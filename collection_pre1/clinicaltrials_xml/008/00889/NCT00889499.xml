	<brief_summary>Chronic pain associate hypersensitivity central nervous system . The drug investigation ( tropisetron ) show animal study attenuate central hypersensitivity . It therefore potential effective chronic pain . We compare two dos tropisetron placebo patient chronic pain . We measure pain intensity parameter assess central hypersensitivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Prolonged afferent nociceptive input induces increase excitability central sensory neuron . The hyperexcitable neuron amplify nociceptive signal , thereby produce exaggerated pain response . This state central hypersensitivity likely contribute pain disability patient , even presence limit tissue damage . The 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 ( 5-HT-3 ) receptor involve spinal nociceptive transmission . After experimentally induced inflammation , selective 5-HT-3 receptor antagonist ondansetron inhibit electrically evoked response dorsal horn neurones , effect response absence inflammation . Importantly , origin pathway spino-brainstem-spinal loop include area brain involve emotional affective response pain . This suggest 5-HT-3 receptor significant role normal condition , activate peripheral inflammation contribute spinal cord hyperexcitability . Their activity could drive anxiety fear . Spinal cord hyperexcitability elicit trauma , inflammation surgery influence descend facilitatory inhibitory pathway . The periaqueductal grey endogenous opioid peptide play central role inhibition spinal cord neuronal response . Release enkephalin supraspinal spinal level evoke noxious stimulation . Further inhibitory modulation exert serotonergic noradrenergic system . These mechanism may underlie possible role psychological disturbance spinal cord process nociceptive non-nociceptive stimulus . While central hypersensitivity mechanism extensively investigate animal , data patient sparse . In patient , direct measurement spinal cord brain neuron make . Therefore , impossible provide direct evidence neuronal hyperexcitability . However , hypersensitivity investigate indirectly quantitative sensory test . Typically , hypersensitivity detect sensory stimulation evokes pain stimulus intensity induce pain normal subject ( low pain threshold ) standardise painful stimulus evokes strong pain patient normal subject . Other method explore sensory system available , detailed description beyond scope section . Whenever pain hypersensitivity observe sensory stimulation healthy area , cause must hyperexcitability central nervous system . Indeed , evidence peripheral mechanism could account high pain sensitivity healthy tissue . Using sensory test , central hyperexcitability detect different chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome , neck pain whiplash injury , fibromyalgia , osteoarthritis temporomandibular disorder . Objective electrophysiological evidence spinal cord hypersensitivity recently provide patient neck pain whiplash injury fibromyalgia patient . Few attempt make modulate central hypersensitivity patient . Infiltration local anaesthetic painful tender muscle patient chronic neck pain reduce either neck pain pain threshold . This indicate source pain locate infiltrated muscle central hypersensitivity maintain nociceptive input arise muscle , least patient population investigate . Selective 5-HT-3 receptor antagonist proven effective patient fibromyalgia . Because fibromyalgia associate central hypersensitivity , one postulate activation spinal 5-HT-3 system one mechanism involve pathophysiology pain syndrome . The facilitatory pathway mediate receptor involves part brain associate emotional affective response pain . An effect selective 5-HT-3 receptor antagonist musculoskeletal pain syndrome associated central hypersensitivity , whiplash osteoarthritis , rule . In recent placebo-controlled study , single intravenous injection selective 5-HT-3 receptor antagonist Ondansetron produce pain relief patient neuropathic pain . Objective The project address follow main hypothesis . A . Reduction pain central hypersensitivity accomplish administration 5-HT-3 antagonist tropisetron . B . The analgesic effect Tropisetron predict individual patient electrophysiological measurement assess central hypersensitivity . Methods Pain intensity assess visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . The following measure central hypersensitivity employ : pain detection pain tolerance threshold electrical stimulation , heat cold stimulation , spinal nociceptive reflex , assessment reflex receptive field temporal summation .</detailed_description>
