	<brief_summary>In recent several clinical trial , remote precondition show powerful myocardial protection . However , myocardial protective effect remote precondition evaluated patient undergo pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery ( OPCAB ) . The investigator hypothesize low limb remote preconditioning could protect myocardium OPCAB . In study , investigator try evaluate whether remote preconditioning could induce myocardial protection OPCAB patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In recent two clinical trial patient undergo cardiac surgery , remote precondition show powerful myocardial protection simple safe procedure brief inflation pneumatic tourniquet upper low limb . However , despite impressive result , clinical study lack yet . Moreover , two previous study do cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass . Considering different mechanism , level myocardial injury increase popularity OPCAB , need clinical study remote precondition OPCAB patient . In study , conduct randomize controlled clinical trial remote precondition induce low limb ischemia double-blinded technique . Myocardial injury assess postoperative serum troponin I level compare control group .</detailed_description>
