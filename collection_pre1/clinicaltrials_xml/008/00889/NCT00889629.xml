	<detailed_description>People kidney transplant often develop bone disease . One reason bone disease may overactivity gland neck call parathyroid gland . Overactivity parathyroid gland may cause lack Vitamin D body . It recently discover many patient kidney transplant low Vitamin D level . 25-OH Vitamin D3 recommend treat kidney transplant patient low vitamin D level may enough treat parathyroid problem bone disease . Doxercalciferol form Vitamin D use treat bone disease parathyroid problem dialysis patient yet study patient kidney transplant . We interested see whether doxercalciferol give together 25-OH Vitamin D3 well treatment overactive parathyroid gland bone disease 25-OH Vitamin D3 alone patient kidney transplant .</detailed_description>
