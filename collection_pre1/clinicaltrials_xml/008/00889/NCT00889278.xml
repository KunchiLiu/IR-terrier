	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine high absolute lymphocyte count infused stem cell autograft ( A-ALC ) lead improve antibody response post-transplant immunization Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine permit effective immunization 6 month post-transplant lymphoma patient receive Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Higher Infused Lymphocyte Counts Improve Antibody Response Immunization After Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infectious disease remain leading cause morbidity mortality patient receive high-dose chemotherapy follow Autologous Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation ( APBSCT ) . Infectious disease complication transplantation might reduce effective post-transplant immunization reconstitution immune system may take month year transplantation responses immunization often attenuate set . Correlates improve immune reconstitution response immunization transplantation would important identify . It recently show high absolute lymphocyte count infused stem cell autograft ( A-ALC ) high ALC day +15 stem cell infusion ( ALC-15 ) independently associate improved overall survival APBSCT . The mechanism association unclear , find suggests improve immune response immunization might also achieve approach make possible immunize 6 month instead one year . This hypothesis never evaluate . Survival follow APBSCT improve high A-ALC ALC-15 . It postulate high lymphocyte number correlate improve immune surveillance destruction minimal residual disease . Thus , one must consider probability high A-ALC confer improved response T-cell dependent immunization early transplant .</detailed_description>
