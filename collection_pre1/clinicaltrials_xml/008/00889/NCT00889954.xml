	<brief_summary>Patients advanced stage cancer . This study gene transfer research study use special immune cell . The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight cancer : antibody T cell . Investigators hope work well together . Antibodies proteins protect body disease cause infectious disease possibly cancer . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include tumor cell cell infected germ . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer : show promise , strong enough cure patient . T lymphocytes kill tumor cell normally enough able kill tumor cell . We do research grow `` extra '' T lymphocytes . We add gene T lymphocytes help recognize tumor cell . Although result promise , still research area . Antibodies usually circulate blood secrete cell immune system response presence germ abnormal cell body . The antibody use study call anti-HER2 ( Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ) . This antibody stick HER2-positive cancer cell substance outside cell call HER2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient give blood grow T cell either one two separate occasion . Then , EBV-specific T cell make . These cell grow frozen . To get HER2 antibody ( CD28 ) DNR attach surface EBV-T cell , antibody gene DNR gene insert EBV-T cell . This do two virus call retrovirus make study . One carry antibody gene T cell DNR gene . When patient enrol study , assign dose HER2-DNR EBV-T cell . The subject give one dose cell vein IV line . The injection take 1 10 minute . The patient follow clinic injection 1 4 hour . The treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The patient must meet following eligibility inclusion criterion time PROCUREMENT : 1 . Diagnosis advance stage* metastatic HER2positive cancer ( Immunohistochemistry RTPCR use determine HER2 positivity ) Definitions Malignancies Advanced Stages : Breast ≥Stage IIIb Colon cancer ≥Stage IIIb Esophageal cancer ≥Stage IIIb Gastric carcinoma ≥Stage IIIb Head Neck cancer Stage IV Lung cancer ≥Stage IIIb Pancreatic cancer Stage IV Prostate cancer Stage IV *it expect majority patient accrue protocol one HER2positive malignancy list table . If patient 's malignancy list use ≥ Stage IIIb definition advance stage disease . If Stage IIIb part stag system individual tumor , Stage IV use . For WHO grade III IV brain tumor ) : patient eligible , recurrent progressive disease front line therapy . 2 . Karnofsky/Lansky score 50 3 . EBV seropositive 4 . Greater equal 3 year old 5 . Informed consent explain , understood sign patient/guardian . Patient/guardian give copy inform consent . The patient must meet following eligibility criterion include TREATMENT : 1 . Diagnosis advance stage* metastatic HER2positive cancer disease progress receive least one prior systemic therapy . ( Immunohistochemistry RTPCR use determine HER2 positivity ) *for definition refer Table . 2 . Greater equal 3 year old . 3 . EBVseropositive 4 . Recovered acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy least week enter study . 5 . Normal ECHO ( Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) normal , institutional limit ) 5 . Life expectancy 6 week 7 . Karnofsky/Lansky score 50 8 . Bilirubin 3x less , AST 5x less , Serum creatinine 2x less upper limit normal , Hgb 9.0 g/dl , WBC great 2,000/ul , ANC great 1,000/ul , Platelets great 100,000/ul 9 . Pulse oximetry 90 % room air 10 . Sexually active patient must willing utilize one effective birth control method 6 month CTL infusion . Male partner use condom . Acceptable form birth control include : * oral contraceptive ( `` pill '' ) , * intrauterine device ( IUDs ) , * contraceptive implant skin , contraceptive injection , * condoms foam . 11 . Available autologous transduce EBVspecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes 15 % expression HER2 CAR determine flowcytometry kill Her2positive target 20 % cytotoxicity assay . 12 . Informed consent explain , understood sign patient/guardian . Patient/guardian give copy inform consent Note : Patients must also receive antineoplastic drug study since would kill infused T cell . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : At time Procurement : 1 . Known HIV positivity At time Treatment : 1 . Severe intercurrent infection 2 . Known HIV positivity 3 . Pregnant lactate 4 . History hypersensitivity reaction murine proteincontaining product</criteria>
