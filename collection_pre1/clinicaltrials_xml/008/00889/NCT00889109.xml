	<brief_summary>Shoulder dislocation common may result functionally disable instability . Disruption shoulder capsuloligamentous complex shoulder dislocation relate poor proprioceptive stabilize capability joint . It demonstrate surgical restoration normal glenohumeral capsular tensioning improves proprioceptive capability shoulder play important roll restore shoulder stability . Several study compare proprioceptive capability shoulder different surgical procedure , however use `` dynamic unrestricted 3-dimensional arm movement model '' show appropriate assessment glenohumeral proprioception . To knowledge , previous study compare proprioception measure glenohumeral joint follow arthroscopic versus open repair anterior shoulder instability , use 3-dimensional unrestricted arm movement model .</brief_summary>
