	<brief_summary>Background : - Globally , Plasmodium falciparum parasite responsible least 247 million acute case malaria year , result 1 million death . Approximately 90 percent death , majority child 5 year age , occur Africa due infection P. falciparum . - People live endemic area develop natural immunity P. falciparum result repeat infection . Consequently , child survive 5 year age rarely succumb life-threatening disease despite frequent infection . This acquire immunity mediate part blood-stage parasite-specific antibody . Thus , parasite protein express blood-stage propose good candidate inclusion vaccine . - A number P. falciparum merozoite antigen identify promising blood-stage vaccine candidate , include Merozoite Surface Protein 1 ( MSP 1 ) Apical Membrane Antigen 1 ( AMA 1 ) . This Phase I study first time combination vaccine ( BSAM-2/Alhydrogel +CPG 7909 ) give human . The vaccine administer randomize , open-label ( U.S. ) /single-blinded ( Mali ) , dose-escalating trial . Objectives : - To assess safety reactogenicity combination vaccine ( BSAM-2/Alhydrogel +CPG 7909 ) malaria-naive U.S. adult semi-immune Malian adult . - To determine antibody response combination vaccine AMA 1 MSP 142 protein , measure antibody level parasite growth inhibition . - To determine extent antibody response individual antigen ( AMA 1 MSP 142 ) correlate combination vaccine give , determine T B cell response vaccination . Eligibility : - United States : Healthy volunteer 18 50 year , inclusive . Available 52 week trial willing participate study evidence sign informed consent document . - Mali : Healthy volunteer 18 45 year , inclusive , know resident village Bancoumana . Available 52 week trial ; willing participate study evidence sign informed consent document fingerprint consent document signature witness . - Potential participant must meet extensive health screening requirement participate study . Good general health require result review medical history clinical testing time screen . - Women pregnant breastfeed eligible . Design : - During 52-week study , participant receive first vaccine complete following : - Physical examination patient education regard sign symptom potential adverse effect . - Blood urine testing , vital sign ( blood pressure , temperature , heart rate , respiratory rate ) . - United States : Education use digital thermometer , injection-site reaction measurement , malaria vaccine side-effect memory enhancement tool ( daily symptom diary ) . - Mali : Additional blood draw malaria smear urine test chloroquine test . - U.S. Mali participant return study site specify day throughout 52 week receive two additional vaccine , record vital sign , complete additional blood urine testing , review patient education . - U.S. participant record oral temperature day , well pain , tenderness , redness , swell injection site systemic sign symptom 6 day follow immunization . - Participants receive financial compensation ( United States ) food ( Mali ) compensate time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase I study evaluate blood stage P. falciparummalaria vaccine candidate BSAM-2/Alhydrogel +CPG 7909 adult US Mali . BSAM-2 contain mixture two protein find surface merozoite , AMA1 MSP1 ( 42 ) . The study open label , dose escalate US , single-blinded randomized comparator vaccine ( Euvax B - Hepatitis B ) Mali . All volunteer receive three dos vaccine , give 0 , 2 , 6 month administer deltoid muscle . The US arm study conduct Center Immunization Research ( CIR ) , Washington DC . Fifteen ( 15 ) healthy volunteer receive 40 ( micro ) g BSAM-2/Alhydrogel +500 ( micro ) g CPG 7909 CIR , follow another 15 receive 160 ( micro ) g BSAM-2/Altlhydrogel +500 ( micro ) g CPG 7909 . Safety data least one week second vaccination US volunteer review Safety Monitoring Committee prior vaccinate volunteer Mali . The high safe dose administer Mali safety data US adult review SMC . The Mali arm study conduct Bancoumana . Thirty ( 30 ) volunteer randomize receive either BSAM 2/Alhydrogel +CPG7909 license comparator vaccine . The primary objective study demonstrate safety reactogenicity vaccine malaria naive semi-immune adult . Secondary objective determine antibody response combination vaccine AMA1 MSPl ( 42 ) protein , measure antibody level parasite growth inhibition . Study endpoints incidence local systemic adverse event , antibody response AMA1 MSP1 ( 42 ) protein , vitro growth inhibition falciparum parasite . Exploratory immunologic analysis also conduct .</detailed_description>
