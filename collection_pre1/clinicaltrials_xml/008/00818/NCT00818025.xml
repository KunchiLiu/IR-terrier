	<detailed_description>Lung transplant recipient ( LTR ) experience transplant-related complication , high health resource utilization , high mortality recipient solid organ . Prevention detection early complication know reduce likelihood future impairment lung function , therefore , morbidity mortality . Despite scarce donor organ financial resource expend support individual throughout lung transplant experience , randomize control trial ( RCT ) test intervention design promote self-care behavior aim improve transplant-related health lung transplant . The purpose RCT compare efficacy novel behavioral intervention , Pocket PATH ( Personal Assistant Tracking Health ) promote self-care improve health outcome relative standard care lung transplantation . Pocket PATH provide LTR hand-held device customize data recording , trend , decision-support program promote self-care behavior . Based promising result early trial , full-scale RCT design rigorously test efficacy Pocket PATH promote self-care agency , self-care behavior , hence improve transplant-related health . A sample 214 LTR survive immediate intensive care unit recovery period randomly assign either intervention group , instruct use Pocket Path device program design self-monitoring , adhere regimen , communicate condition change transplant team , control group receive standard instruction regard post-transplant regimen ( include health monitoring ) . Information collect participant baseline 1 week , 2 , 6 , 12 month discharge hospital follow lung transplantation . Longitudinal , repeated-measures model plan comparison use test hypotheses primary aim . It hypothesize subject Pocket PATH group develop high level self-care agency perform self-care behavior often subject control group , therefore , experience few transplant-related complication , re-hospitalizations , good health relate quality life .</detailed_description>
