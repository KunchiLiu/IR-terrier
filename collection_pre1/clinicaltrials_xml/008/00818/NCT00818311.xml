	<brief_summary>Photomodulation process manipulate regulates cell activity use light source without thermal effect . Different study investigate use non-thermal low dose light emit diode ( LED ) array improve appearance photo age damage . The photomodulation concept include low energy , narrow band coherent light specific pulse sequence duration . Preliminary investigation do McDaniel et al . demonstrate fibroblast activity could regulate use pulse light specific wavelenghts . Using variety LED light source , group demonstrate vary light pulse parameter , procollagen synthesis could upregulated human skin fibroblast culture [ McDaniel DH , et al.Lasers Surg Med . 2002 ; 14-251 ] . A clinical correlation also show base different clinical trial data around 1000 subject , LED show 90 % improvement wrinkle increase collagen synthesis versus control little side effect associate [ Weiss , RA et al .

Based promising clinical data , Light BioScience submit dossier Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) obtain January 2005 FDA approval GentleWaves® Light Emitting Diode ( LED ) non-invasive treatment periorbital ( eye area ) wrinkle rhytids . The LED technology consider FDA non significant risk . In Europe , GentleWaves® Light Emitting Diode obtain notify body certification indication . This medical claim associate cosmetic improvement age sun-damaged skin , validation science LED photomodulation skin rejuvenation [ Investigator 's Brochure . Version 1 ] . This approval obtain professional LED GentleWaves® device use physician 's responsibility . The initial regimen 35 second twice per week least two day treatment total 4 week duration treatment demonstrate efficacy treatment typical sign photo age adverse effect . A monocentre , randomize clinical study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skin Safety Profile Different Exposure Light Emitting Diode ( LED ) Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate different treatment regimen order able develop new indication optimize result already obtain treatment wrinkle around eye . We therefore propose perform safety clinical trial male female volunteer different schedule per day per week . A total 100 subject ( male female ) randomize study accord follow schedule exposure : Group A : 20 subject ( 8 male - 12 female ) expose LED twice week one cycle ( 35 second ) interval treatment least 2 day , treatment period 4 week . Group B : 20 subject ( 8 male - 12 female ) expose LED twice week two consecutive cycle ( 35 second ) interval treatment least 2 day , treatment period 4 week . Group C : 20 subject ( 8 male - 12 female ) expose LED one cycle ( 35 second ) twice day ( morning evening ) . This treatment repeat twice week interval treatment least 2 day , treatment period 4 week . Group D : 20 subject ( 8 male - 12 female ) expose LED one cycle ( 35 second ) every day ( Monday Friday ) treatment period 4 week . Group E : 20 subject ( 8 male - 12 female ) expose LED two consecutive cycle ( 35 second ) every day ( Monday Friday ) treatment period 4 week . treatment period 4 week . Group D : 20 subject ( 8 male - 12 female ) expose LED one cycle ( 35 second ) every day ( Monday Friday ) treatment period 4 week . Group E : 20 subject ( 8 male - 12 female ) expose LED two consecutive cycle ( 35 second ) every day ( Monday Friday ) treatment period 4 week .</detailed_description>
