	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy , intensity-modulated radiation therapy , delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know radiation therapy schedule effective treating breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study three different radiation therapy schedule compare well work treat woman undergone breast conservation surgery systemic therapy early breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To test dose-escalated intensity-modulated radiotherapy breast conservation surgery woman early breast cancer high average risk local recurrence . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord center . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I ( control ) : Patients undergo sequential boost dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) 5 day week 4.6 week ( 23 fraction ; 56 Gy ) . - Arm II : Patients undergo concurrent boost dose IMRT 5 day week 3 week ( 15 fraction ; 48 Gy ) . - Arm III : Patients undergo concurrent boost dose IMRT 5 day week 3 week ( 15 fraction ; 53 Gy ) . Quality-of-life questionnaire administer baseline , 6 month , 1 , 3 , 5 year . Photograph assessments breast take baseline 3 5 year . Blood sample collect baseline periodically thereafter . Tissue sample also collect primary tumor , include new primary tumor either breast , recurrent tumor . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
