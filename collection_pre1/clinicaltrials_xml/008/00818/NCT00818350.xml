	<brief_summary>Gemcitabine cisplatin represent standard first-line chemotherapy metastatic bladder carcinoma . This regimen replace center MVAC combination show similar efficacy less toxicity . Almost respond patient relapse within first year , median survival 12 month . Prognosis poor patient display progressive disease receive combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy . No standard yet establish second-line treatment well design trial second-line chemotherapy metastatic transitional carcinoma urothelium give high priority . Several drug use second line metastatic disease poor result . The investigator plan Phase II study , open-label , single arm design evaluate activity safety sunitinib metastatic urothelial carcinoma , pretreated standard regimen ( cisplatin-gemcitabine ) . No previous study publish sunitinib metastatic bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Activity Study Sunitinib In Metastatic Pretreated Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES - PRIMARY To determine antitumor efficacy ( response rate ) sunitinib - SECONDARY To determine : safety , duration response , Quality life ( QoL ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . PLAN OF TREATMENT Patients receive sunitinib start dose 50 mg per day repeat 6-week cycle 4 consecutive week follow 2 week treatment . Sunitinib self-administered orally daily without regard meal . Dose reduction toxicity allow 37.5 25 mg/day depend type severity toxicity encounter . Sunitinib treatment continue disease progression , unacceptable toxicity withdrawal consent . EVALUATION Baseline evaluation include : - medical history - physical examination ; - tumor assessment ( total body TC bone scan ) - assessment ECOG PS - QoL assessment - Assessment leave ventricular ejection fraction echocardiography - ECG - Laboratory measurement . Assessment efficacy safety - Evaluation accord RECIST criterion every 2 cycle ( 12 week ) TC - Safety accord NCI version 3 every cycle - QoL every cycle EORTC-QOL-C30.â€¢ RESOURCE UTILIZATION ASSESSMENTS EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire , develop EORTC measurement quality life cancer patient clinical trial . For analysis , raw score questionnaire transform 100-point scale . For functional scale , compute score range 0 100 , high score represent high level functioning . For item scale relative physical symptom financial impact , high score represent high level symptom problem . STATISTICAL METHODS Benefit anticipate ( % ) : &gt; 30 % response rate . Test size : 5 % . Power 80 % . Sample size : 25 patient .</detailed_description>
