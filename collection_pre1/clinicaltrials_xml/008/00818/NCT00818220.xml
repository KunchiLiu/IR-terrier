	<brief_title>Protective Effects Delayed Cord Clamping Very Low Birth Weight ( VLBW ) Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current obstetrical practice birth United States umbilical cord low birth weight ( VLBW ) infant clamp immediately . When immediate cord clamping occur , 25 % fetal-placental blood volume may leave placenta acutely increase vulnerability hypovolemia . Hypovolemia precipitate cascade physiologic event include poor tissue perfusion , ischemia , initiation fetal/neonatal inflammatory response . Intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) major cause brain injury preterm infant predictor poor neurodevelopment outcome . Late onset sepsis ( LOS ) also associate morbidity mortality NICU later developmental delay . Of approximately 57,000 infant bear annually less 1500 gram , 10 % develop cerebral palsy 25 50 % show later cognitive behavioral deficit affect school performance high rate find male . We propose trial sample 212 randomized infant validate prior finding delay cord clamp lower incidence intraventricular hemorrhage late onset sepsis , identify mechanism effect study biologic marker include measurement cytokine , circulate stem cell , red cell volume . Enrolled woman preterm labor randomize birth immediate cord clamp group delay clamp group . Assessment motor outcome plan 7 month correct age . This study help establish scientific basis timing cord clamp VLBW infant . The innovation study simplicity delay cord clamp 30 45 second lower VLBW infant birth . This low-tech change clinical practice potential reduce risk disease disability improve neonatal early childhood outcome vulnerable preterm infant .</detailed_description>
