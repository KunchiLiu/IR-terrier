Three aspect maternal child health compromise pregnant woman thyroid deficient : 1 ) woman 's health well-being ; 2 ) baby 's brain development ; 3 ) overall health pregnancy ( e.g. , fetal death , prematurity , preeclampsia ) . Thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) measurement , well accepted indicator thyroid dysfunction , serve primary test diagnosis monitoring . A TSH value &gt; 10 mU/L indicate overt hypothyroidism . Among state 's 14,000 annual pregnancy , 42 woman ( 0.3 % ) overtly hypothyroid early gestation ( 32 undiagnosed , 10 under-treated ) . TSH value 4.5 mU/L ( 98th centile ) 9.9 mU/L indicate subclinical hypothyroidism . The 240 woman category also receive treatment , information gather disease progression inform future practice . Approximately half RI 's pregnancy care practice Greater Providence , TSH test initially introduce , . The research component also within area . Testing subsequently extend entire state . The program centrally manage three unit Women Infants Hospital , consultation RI 's Birth Defects Program Director . Program goal : provide TSH test least 70 % pregnant woman Greater Providence ; provide TSH test least 50 % pregnant woman elsewhere RI ; test 70 % screen woman 12 week ' gestation , 90 % 18 week ' gestation ; begin treatment Greater Providence 13 week ' 70 % , 19 week ' 90 % ; document successful treatment pregnancy 90 % ( TSH &gt; 0.1 mU/L &lt; 2.0 mU/L ; retain 95 % treat woman end pregnancy , 90 % 1 year postpartum ; obtain pregnancy complication birth outcome entire cohort ( Vital Records ) . Data collect participation practice woman , % woman undiagnosed thyroid deficiency , compliance follow-up treatment pregnancy one year afterwards , outcome pregnancy , % hypothyroid woman postpartum thyroid dysfunction , % woman subclinical hypothyroidism remain hypothyroid one year postpartum , physician attitude , program cost .</detailed_description>
