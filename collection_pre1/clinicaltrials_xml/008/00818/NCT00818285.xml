	<brief_title>Reducing Injuries From Medication-Related Falls Using Computerized Alerts High Risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Fall-related injury account significant morbidity mortality , particularly elderly multiple comorbidities age-related change bone density increase risk fall-related fracture Indeed use psychotropic medication elderly person associate 2 29 fold increase risk fall 2 5 fold increase risk hip fracture . At particular risk individual age 70 , prior history fall , cognitive impairment , stroke , Parkinson 's disease , condition would impair balance gait . In particular study population , 67.5 % person psychotropic drug prescribing problem least one additional risk factor fall-related injury . This particularly true woman likely psychotropic drug prescribe alert men also likely risk factor . 70.3 % woman psychotropic prescribe alert risk factor comparison 62.1 % men , particularly relate old age history fall-related fracture soft-tissue injury past 12 month . A recent in-hospital study show provide physician patient-specific recommendation change high risk psychotropic therapy computerize order-entry system reduce prescription non-recommended drug dose 10 % , turn associate significant two-fold reduction in-hospital fall rate { 5007 } . If even 5 % reduction ( annual prevalence 16.1 % 11.1 % ) could achieve primary care target recommendation high risk patient psychotropic drug prescribing alert , would expect could conservatively reduce number fall among Canadian elderly ( assume low risk RR=1.66 ) 116,064 82,212 number fall-related injury 11,606 8,221 . Based average cost treat fall-related injury $ 20,000/injury { 5006 } , reduction adverse event magnitude would associate annual saving $ 67,708,000 direct care cost . The research question follow : Can medication-related fall injury reduce use computerized electronic prescribe drug management system identify high risk patient provide physician patient-specific recommendation modify psychotropic medication use reduce risk ? Objective : To determine extent target psychotropic drug alert recommendation system reduce ) rate potentially inappropriate psychotropic medication patient risk fall-related injury , b ) fall-related injury risk , fall-related injury hospitalization . Research Plan : A single blind , cluster randomize control trial conduct test hypothesize benefit target psychotropic drug alert recommendation system versus standard automate generic drug alert system within fix cohort primary care physicians open cohort patient see study physician 16 month follow-up period assessment reduction potentially inappropriate psychotropic prescription fall-related injury . A single blind trial plan intervention status blind physician study . However , study participant blind outcome assess , data require assess outcomes predominantly collect assessed use data source independent intervention status . Patients , cluster within physician , unit analysis patient level information provide precise , non-ecological , method study outcomes well potential confounders , hierarchical multivariate analytic method available model cluster assessment treatment effect { Chuang , 2000 4339 /id } . The benefit intervention assess compare patient physician receive psychotropic drug alert recommendation system patient physicians receive automated drug decision support . This approach minimize Hawthorne effect , arise intensive nature practice intervention require support computer-based system primary care would likely result over-estimation benefit computer-based decision support drug management compare physician computerize intervention . Further , provide mean information prescription , drug disease profile assess equivalent way patient physician automate control target alert experimental decision-support , reduce bias related difference measurement source .</detailed_description>
