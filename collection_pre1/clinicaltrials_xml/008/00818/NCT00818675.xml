	<detailed_description>Allocation Arms Additional Information : All Patients receive 8-week open-label lead-in treatment ridaforolimus . After 8 week period patient re-assessed disease status . Patients stable 8 week randomize double-blind fashion continue treatment ridaforolimus placebo disease progression .
