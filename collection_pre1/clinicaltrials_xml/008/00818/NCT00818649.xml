	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib vorinostat may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving bortezomib together vorinostat may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together vorinostat work treat patient high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome acute myelogenous leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Vorinostat Treating Patients With High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine clinical response bortezomib vorinostat patient high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia , define International Working Group response criterion . Secondary - To characterize quantitative qualitative toxicity regimen patient . - To assess effect regimen natural killer ( NK ) cell function , term activate inhibitory receptor alteration , target cell ligand HLA class I modulation , NK-mediated cell kill . - To correlate change clinical response . OUTLINE : Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously ( SQ ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 oral vorinostat daily day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response , partial response , hematologic improvement may receive 3 additional course therapy ( maximum 6 course ) . Bone marrow peripheral blood sample collect baseline completion 3 course therapy analysis target cell ( myeloid blast ) ( i.e. , HLA class I receptor analysis natural killer [ NK ] cell receptor ligand analysis ) analysis activate NK cell receptor alteration NK-mediated cell kill . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 1 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Disease Specific Criteria : Pathologic Diagnosis must confirm University Minnesota Hematopathology Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) : By IPSS Category : INT2 High risk , By WHO Classification : RAEB1 RAEB2 , By cytogenetics : High Risk Cytogenetic Abnormality Present define presence Monosomy 7 complex karyotype . Patients eligible progress standard therapy either Azacitidine Decitabine . Patients history 5q minus syndrome may eligible progress treatment Lenalidomide . Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) : Histologic subtypes M0 , M1 , M2 , M4 , M5 , M6 , M7 eligible must meet one three criterion : Refractory Disease/Induction Failure : Failure achieve initial remission 2 line induction therapy . Relapsed Disease Newly diagnosed/untreated AML : Patients able tolerate potentially curative conventional induction chemotherapy due advanced age , end organ limitation , performance status limitation eligible . Additionally , refuse conventional induction therapy eligible . Patients must relatively stable bone marrow function week prior enrollment study . White Blood cell ( WBC ) may control hydrea . Rapid WBC double responsive control hydrea would indicate unstable bone marrow function . Ideally WBC &lt; 15 X 10^3 /dl time study enrollment . Age &gt; 18 year Karnofsky performance status &gt; = 60 % Have acceptable organ function define within 28 day enrollment : Hematologic : hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dL , platelet &gt; 20k . ( Patients may receive transfusion either peripheral red blood cell ( PRBC ) platelet achieve level ) Renal : creatinine &lt; = 2.0 mg/dL creatinine clearance &gt; = 40 ml/min Hepatic : ALT , AST &lt; = 2.5 x upper limit normal total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 X ULN Cardiac : leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40 % ( test require patient . For prior cardiac history ( define prior stent bypass surgery ) stress test within 1 month prior proceed study require . A cardiology consult require prior documented cardiac disease significant EKG/ECHO abnormality find screen test . Patients must receive treatment myeloid disorder within 2 week begin trial . Treatments include use chemotherapy , hematopoietic growth factor , biologic therapy monoclonal antibody . The exception use hydroxyurea patient elevate WBC . Given relatively slower expect clinical response study drug , patient may continue receive hydroxyurea first cycle therapy . Must recover clinically significant toxicity previous therapy . Women child bear potential must agree use adequate contraception ( diaphragm , birth control pill , injection , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , surgical sterilization , subcutaneous implant , abstinence , etc . ) duration treatment . In addition , woman childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test bhCG within 72 hour prior receive first dose therapy . Sexually active men must agree use barrier contraceptive duration treatment . Voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . Treatment History Criteria : Patients relapse allogeneic stem cell transplantation eligible . Pregnant lactating . The agent use study know teratogenic fetus information excretion agent breast milk . All female childbearing potential must blood test within 72 hour prior study drug administration rule pregnancy . Grade 2 great peripheral neuropathy within 14 day enrollment Active central nervous system ( CNS ) disease . Patients clinical symptom active CNS disease must LP negative cytology . WBC Peripheral Blast count uncontrolled hydroxyurea Evidence QT prolongation QTc interval great 0.5 second . QTc calculation EKG machine use assessment . Clinical evidence heart failure history uncontrolled hypertension . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality Screening document investigator medically relevant . Patients untreated positive blood culture progressive infection assess radiographic study Patients prior use histone deacetylase inhibitor ( exclude valproic acid seizures 30 day washout period ) Known hypersensitivity Velcade , boron agent use study Patients history deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism ( DVT/PE ) adequately treat systemic anticoagulation recently diagnose ( within last 2 month ) .
