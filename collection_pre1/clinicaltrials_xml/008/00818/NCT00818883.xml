	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Azilsartan Medoxomil Chlorthalidone Participants With Moderate Severe Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According World Health Organization , hypertension common attributable cause preventable death develop nation , uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure . Despite availability antihypertensive agent , hypertension remain inadequately control ; one-third patient continue maintain control successfully . Although antihypertensive agent effective appropriate dose , majority side effect limit use . As class , angiotensin II receptor blocker generally consider tolerable class antihypertensive agent . TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) angiotensin II receptor blocker evaluate Takeda treat essential hypertension . Treatments essential hypertension commonly include use thiazide-like diuretic , either alone part combination treatment . Although chlorthalidone commonly prescribe past , use widely replace hydrochlorothiazide , presumably due lack available combination product contain chlorthalidone , assumption hydrochlorothiazide chlorthalidone similar antihypertensive effect cardiovascular benefit , perception chlorthalidone use associate great frequency hypokalemia . However , frequency hypokalemia chlorthalidone use relatively low dose range 12.5 25 mg dos show associated potent blood pressure reduction . Several long-term outcome trial show blood pressure reduction associate chlorthalidone treatment reduce risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Most hypertensive patient require two agent achieve target blood pressure diuretic commonly use combination antihypertensive agent . This trial design compare chlorthalidone hydrochlorothiazide coadministered azilsartan medoxomil . Participants study receive either chlorthalidone hydrochlorothiazide combination azilsartan medoxomil . Total commitment time study 13 week . Participants require wear blood pressure monitor three 24 hour period study .</detailed_description>
