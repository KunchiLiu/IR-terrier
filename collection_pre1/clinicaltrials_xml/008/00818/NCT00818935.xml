	<detailed_description>Recruitment : Subjects study source primarily University Hospital West Indices ( Diabetic Clinic ) Diabetes Association Jamaica Outreach Centers Kingston St. Catherine . Volunteers also recruit clinical visit opportunistic population screening place advertisement local newspaper distribute similar advertisement diabetes clinic diabetes education program .

During session exact nature study describe volunteer opportunity ask specific question study . Screening : Potential subject fill return investigator detail questionnaire concern medical history , medication ( include vitamin , mineral nutritional supplement ) smoke habit , alcohol intake exercise pattern whether currently specific diet . Details also obtain concern plan vacation . Those subject deem potentially eligible ask give fasting blood sample Biotechnology Center , University West Indies . Individuals meet study criterion , invite return Department . The principle diabetic diet already expect follow reinforce study nutritionist whereby consume diet 50 % daily calorie carbohydrate ; le 10 % saturate fat 20 % mono- polyunsaturated fat , 25 % surplus monounsaturated fat ; cholesterol le 300 mg/day ; approximately 1.0 g protein per kg ideal weight per day . An increase intake dietary fiber 15 g per 1000 kcal encourage . All subject randomize one 24-week treatment two-treatment parallel design . Treatments : 1 ) low glycemic index dietary advice ( e.g . eat intact grain cereal , boil green banana , boil sweet potato , boil round leaf yellow yam boil breadfruit ) 2 ) high cereal fiber diet . Background diet subject ' diabetic diet , modify , conform . Diet history record weekly 24 week . These diet assess consistency dietitian subject 's presence dietary recall semi-quantitative assessment food portion size consume . Where necessary , modification diet make ensure weight maintenance . Compliance assess 7 day food record . Duration : study consist four month recruitment patient selection , time estimation individual caloric requirement perform , 6 month treatment period . Study Details : Fasting blood sample obtain day zero week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 24 study period . Twenty-four hour urine urinary C-peptide analysis obtain immediately prior begin study end 24-week treatment phase . Palatability satiety : subject record rating use 9-point bipolar semantic scale weekly interval study phase . Anthropometric measure : height recruitment , waist hip circumference , body composition take immediately prior end study phase . Body weight blood pressure measure clinic visit . This study help indicate whether low-intermediate-GI indigenous Caribbean food dietary advice reduce postprandial glycemia , inflammation cardiovascular risk person type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
