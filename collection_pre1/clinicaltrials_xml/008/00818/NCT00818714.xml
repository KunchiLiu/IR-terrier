	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) Boost After Definitive Concurrent Chemoradiation ( ChemoRT ) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) GCC 0516</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol design use stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) deliver boost dose residual primary tumor definitive dos standard external beam radiation deliver concurrently chemotherapy . It design determine toxicity profile ( side effect ) context dose escalation stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) definitive therapy concurrent chemoradiation define maximum tolerate dose . Serum level TGF-Beta1 demonstrate correlate incidence radiation toxicity , pneumonitis patient treated standard external beam radiation . This study serially follow TGF-Beta1 level patient see correlation exists SBRT toxicity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histological confirmation nonsmall cell lung cancer require either biopsy cytology . The following primary cancer type eligible : squamous cell carcinoma , adenocarcinoma , large cell carcinoma , bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma , nonsmall cell carcinoma otherwise specify . 2 . Eligible patient must appropriate stag study identify specific subset AJCC stage III base one follow combination TNM staging : T1N23M0 T2N23M0 T3N13M0 Patients T4 tumor ( definition ) eligible 3 . Patients must complete treatment concurrent chemotherapy external beam radiation therapy radiation dose &gt; 59.4Gy &lt; 70.2Gy primary tumor dose &gt; 45Gy &lt; 70.2Gy mediastinal structure within 6 9 week first SBRT `` Boost '' treatment . 4 . Patients must repeat stag performed chemoradiation within 28 day first protocol treatment include : CT scan chest upper abdomen , FDG18 PET scan MRI brain . These study must demonstrate disease outside thorax . 5 . The primary tumor must deem technically resectable chemoradiation experience thoracic cancer clinician , reasonable possibility obtain gross total resection negative margin ( define potentially curative resection , PCR ) . However , patient must candidate PCR base pathologic evidence persistent mediastinal lymphadenopathy chemoradiation underlie physiological medical problem would prohibit PCR due low probability tolerate general anesthesia , operation , postoperative recovery period , removal adjacent functioning lung . These type patient severe underlie health problem deem `` medically inoperable . '' Standard justification deem patient medically inoperable base pulmonary function surgical resection NSCLC may include follow : Baseline FEV1 &lt; 40 % predict , postoperative predict FEV1 &lt; 30 % predict , severely reduced diffusion capacity , baseline hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia , exercise oxygen consumption &lt; 50 % predict , severe pulmonary hypertension , diabetes mellitus severe end organ damage , severe cerebral , cardiac , peripheral vascular disease , severe chronic heart disease . 6 . Patients must â‰¥ 18 year age . 7 . The patient 's Zubrod performance status must Zubrod 02 . 8 . Women childbearing potential male participant must use effective contraceptive method condom/diaphragm spermicidal foam , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , prescription birth control pill . 9 . Pretreatment Evaluations Required Eligibility include : A medical history , physical examination , weight , assessment Zubrod performance status within 2 week prior study entry . Evaluation thoracic surgeon pulmonologist within 4 week prior study entry ; For woman childbearing potential , serum urine pregnancy test must perform within 72 hour prior start protocol treatment ; PFTs : Routine spirometry , lung volume , diffusion capacity , arterial blood gas within 4 week prior study entry . Mandatory stag study : Must do within 21 day prior study entry CT scan ( preferably intravenous contrast ) include entirety lung , mediastinum , liver , adrenal gland ; Primary tumor dimension measure CT . Whole body positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan use FDG adequate visualization primary tumor drain lymph node basin hilar mediastinal region . MRI brain 10 . Patients must sign studyspecific consent form . 11 . Patients must serious medical psychiatric illness would prevent compliance ability give inform consent . 12 . Labs within 14 day start SBRT : CBC differential , platelet count , Comprehensive metabolic panel include : electrolyte , Albumin , TBilirubin , Calcium , Cl , CO2 , Creatinine , Glucose , K , TProtein , Na , BUN , AlkPhos , AST , ALT , Magnesium . Pretreatment laboratory value must follow : WBC count : &lt; = 2.5 x institutional ULN ; Absolute granulocyte count : &gt; = 1,500/mm3 Platelets : &gt; = 100,000/mm3 Total bilirubin : &lt; = 1.5 x institutional ULN Serum creatinine : &lt; = 1.5x institutional ULN AST ALT : &lt; = 2.5 x institutional ULN Serum albumin : &gt; = 3.0 g/dL 1 Patients primary tumor &gt; 5 cm involve central chest structure mediastinum definitive course chemoradiation . 2 . The primary tumor Tstage within touch zone proximal bronchial tree define volume 2 cm direction around proximal bronchial tree ( carina , right leave main bronchus , right leave upper lobe bronchus , intermedius bronchus , right middle lobe bronchus , lingular bronchus , right leave low lobe bronchus . Patients radiographic pneumonitis obscure clear delineation primary tumor patient develop clinical radiation pneumonitis course chemoradiation prior protocol treatment . Direct evidence regional distant metastasis appropriate stag study . Plans patient receive concomitant antineoplastic therapy ( include standard fractionate radiotherapy , chemotherapy , biological therapy , vaccine therapy , surgery ) . Patients may receive antineoplastic therapy discretion treat physician begin 6 week completion protocol therapy . Patients active systemic , pulmonary , pericardial infection . Pregnant lactate woman , treatment involve unforeseeable risk embryo fetus . Major illness psychiatric impairment , investigator 's opinion prevent administration completion protocol therapy /or interfere followup .</criteria>
