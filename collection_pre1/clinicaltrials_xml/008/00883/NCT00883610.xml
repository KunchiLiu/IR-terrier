	<brief_title>Effects Rapid Atrial Pacing Has Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Patients With Dual Chamber Pacemakers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study require total two study day well two follow visit . During study day one , baseline blood drawn , baseline electrocardiogram perform , continuous QT Interval monitoring perform . The pacemaker rate increase 90bpm different time interval additional blood drawn measure effect rate change . On study day two , baseline blood drawn , urine specimen obtain , electrocardiogram perform , continuous QT Interval monitoring perform . Following acquisition information , pacemaker rate decrease 80bpm . We obtain blood specimen , urine specimen electrocardiogram 30 minute post rate change 60 minute post rate change . Two day follow rate decrease 80bpm , patient return clinic rate decrease 70bpm . In two day , patient return final rate change 60bpm .</detailed_description>
