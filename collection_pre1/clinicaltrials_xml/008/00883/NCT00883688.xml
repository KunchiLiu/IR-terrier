	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Lapatinib Children With Recurrent Refractory Ependymoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Bevacizumab design block growth blood vessel supply nutrient necessary tumor growth . This may prevent and/or slow growth cancer cell . Lapatinib design prevent slow growth cancer cell block protein inside cancer cell . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive bevacizumab every 2 week study ( 2 time 4-week `` study cycle '' ) . The first time receive drug , give vein 90 minute . If dose well tolerate , may receive future dose 30 minute . You take pill lapatinib 2 time day study . The pill take time day . You eat drink anything except water 1 hour 1 hour take pill . If miss dose , take extra pill next day try make miss dose . You report miss pill trouble may take pill study doctor . You give patient diary must record time take lapatinib time . Study Visits : At study visit , ask drug may take side effect may experience . During Cycle 1 follow test procedure perform least 1 time week : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . Two ( 2 ) time week Cycle 1 , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . At end Cycle 1 , urine collect routine test . On Days 1 15 Cycle 2 , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . At end Cycle 2 , MRI scan head check status disease . If doctor think need , also MRI spine spinal tap check cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) presence disease . On Day 1 Cycle 3 beyond , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . Every 8 week , start end Cycle 4 , study , follow test procedure perform : - You MRI scan brain check status disease . - If doctor think need , MRI scan spine check status disease . - If doctor think need , spinal tap check CSF presence disease . Every 12 week study , follow test procedure perform check possible side effect : - You echocardiogram multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) ( study doctor think necessary ) test heart function . - You x-ray right knee . - If doctor think need , MRI scan knee . Length Study : You study 2 year . You take study disease get bad , experience intolerable side effect , doctor think best interest . End-of-Treatment Visit : After finish receiving study drug , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask drug may take side effect may experience . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) collect routine test . - You echocardiogram MUGA scan ( study doctor think necessary ) test heart function . - You x-ray right knee . - You MRI scan brain spine check status disease . - If doctor think need , spinal tap check status disease . Long-Term Follow-up : You follow-up visit 30 day finish receive study drug . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ask drug may take side effect may experience . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) collect routine test . This investigational study . Bevacizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment colon , rectum , lung certain type breast cancer . Lapatinib FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type breast cancer . The use drug combination ependymomas pediatric patient investigational . Up 40 patient take part multicenter study . Up 6 patient enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
