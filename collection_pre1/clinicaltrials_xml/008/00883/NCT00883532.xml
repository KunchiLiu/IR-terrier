	<brief_summary>Pulmonary inflammation play important role early development CLD . Postnatal glucocorticoids show effective prevention treatment CLD various success . However , systemic glucocorticoid therapy often associate various short term long term complication . Therefore , modification therapeutic regimen need . Inhaled steroid , include inhaled budesonide , tried result essentially unsuccessful , likely due small airway inhale steroid reach peripheral lung limit unpredictable . Direct instillation budesonide airway also show ineffective , possibly due poor distribution steroid lung . The investigator hypothesize intratracheal instillation budesonide , strong tropical steroid , use surfactant vehicle would facilitate delivery budesonide lung periphery would inhibit lung inflammation improve pulmonary outcome . The result pilot study ( Pediatrics , 2008 ) indicate high possibility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After inform consent obtain , infant randomly assign two group base double-blind design . Group I receive surfactant budesonide GII receive surfactant air control endotracheal route . Therapy give every 8 hour infant require FIO2 &lt; 30 % extubated . The end point assessment combine incidence CLD death judge 36 week postconceptional age long term neurological cognitive function 2-3 year . The incidence CLD death selective group infant 60 % . Using 60 % incidence placebo group expect 40 % ( 33 % improvement ) treat group , 130 infant group need detect difference , permit 5 % chance type I error 10 % chance type II error . The total safe target number 300 ; 150 group . A collaborative study therefore propose . The primary outcome assess combined incidence CLD death . The secondary outcome assess short term long term side effect .</detailed_description>
