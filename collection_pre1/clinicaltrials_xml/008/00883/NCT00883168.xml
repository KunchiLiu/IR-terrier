	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Nasal Spray Treat Seasonal Allergies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study subject moderate-to-severe seasonal allergic rhinitis ( SAR ) . The study begin 7-day , single-blind , placebo lead-in period ( Day -7 Day 1 ) . Subjects instructed take placebo lead-in medication twice daily ( 1 spray per nostril ) , approximately every 12 hour . On Day 1 , subject satisfy symptom severity requirement continue meet study inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize 1:1:1:1 ratio receive 1 spray per nostril twice daily MP29-02 , azelastine hydrochloride , fluticasone propionate , placebo nasal spray . Efficacy assess change baseline subject-reported 12-hour reflective Total Nasal Symptom Score ( TNSS ) . On Days 1 14 , subject rate instantaneous reflective TNSS symptom sneeze , nasal congestion , runny nose , nasal itching ; instantaneous reflective total ocular symptom score ( TOSS ) symptoms itchy eye , watery eye eye redness ; symptom postnasal drip reflectively , twice daily ( AM PM ) diary prior dose study medication . Symptoms score 0 3 scale ( 0 = symptom , 1 = mild symptom , 2 = moderate symptom , 3 = severe symptom ) , maximum daily symptom severity score 24 TNSS 18 TOSS . Additional secondary efficacy variable include reflective individual nasal ocular symptom score , well change Baseline Day 14 Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality Life Questionnaire ( RQLQ ) . Subjects â‰¥ 18 year age complete RQLQ Day 1 ( prior dosing ) Day 14 . Subjects return clinic Day 7 interim evaluation . After complete 2-week double-blind treatment period , subject return clinic Day 14 ( time early termination ) end-of-study evaluation . Safety tolerability assessment make Days 7 14 . Tolerability evaluate subject-reported adverse event ( AEs ) , nasal examination , vital sign assessment</detailed_description>
