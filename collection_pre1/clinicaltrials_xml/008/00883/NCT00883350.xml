	<detailed_description>The prevalence overweight obesity increase significantly past four decade , result 66 % adult population United States ( U.S. ) classify overweight obese ( Wang , 2007 ) . Moreover , over-representation overweight obesity among rural low socioeconomicstatus group ( Wang , 2007 ) . Consequently , large proportion adult population U.S. qualifies weight loss treatment base NIH treatment recommendation ( NHLBI , 1998 ) . Nevertheless , traditional weight loss treatment number limitation , include lifestyle change ( diet , exercise , behavior therapy ) , one first option treat overweight obesity . First , deliver clinical service number individual qualify treatment would overwhelm healthcare system . Second , many people qualify would benefit treatment obtain service due financial limitation geographic location . Third , lifestyle change require significant time-commitment part patient team professional , result fairly costly treatment . Despite cost , lifestyle change fail consistently promote long-term weight loss maintenance amount weight lose short-term frequently fail meet patient expectation ( Foster , 1997 ) . Lastly , lifestyle change typically involve meet patient regularly , e.g. , fortnightly , patient always receive timely feedback modify behavior achieve energy deficit . This significant limitation since learn theory indicate behavior change foster receive specific feedback temporally contiguous target behavior . Feedback delay unspecific less effective inducing behavior change ( Schultz , 2006 ) . The application novel technology health problem improve area health care . For example , telemedicine application use monitor vital sign victim mass casualty disaster ( Gao , 2005 ) . Technology-based methodology also apply weight loss treatment effort improve treatment efficacy affordably deliver service individual limit health care access , people live rural community . To date , `` e-Health '' application focus primarily internet-based intervention , find produce modest weight loss ( Weinstein , 2006 ; Williamson , 2006 ) . Our group conduct many internet-based weight management study ( Williamson , 2006 ; Stewart , 2008 ; Williamson , 2008 ; Williamson , 2007 ) identify limitation negatively affect efficacy e-Health application . First , patient must logon internet report progress data ( e.g. , amount food intake ) receive treatment recommendation , yet patient regularly logon internet application . Second , e-Health application rely participant self-report food intake exercise data , self-reported data typically inaccurate ( Schoeller , 1990 ) . Consequently , quality feedback participant receives limit poor quality self-reported data . Third , application able : ) obtain accurate free-living food intake , exercise , body weight data participant near real-time , b ) evaluate data receive , c ) provide specific feedback participant reasonable amount time ( 1 3 day ) . Based learn theory , ability would result superior behavior change ( Schultz , 2006 ) subsequent weight loss . The purpose propose pilot feasibility study test efficacy Remote Intervention Diet Exercise ( RIDE ) e-Health application promote weight loss . The RIDE e-Health application address limitation internet-based intervention note . The application rely novel technology collect near real-time food intake , body weight , exercise data participant reside free-living environment . These data transmit researcher near real-time : food intake data collect transmitted camera Bluetooth-enabled cell phone , body weight data automatically transmit bathroom scale use phone , accelerometry use collect exercise data transmit via internet . These data analyze personalized treatment recommendation send participant via cell phone timely manner , e.g. , every 1 3 day .</detailed_description>
