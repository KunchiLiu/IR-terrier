	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder ( OAB ) syndrome described 'urgency , without urge incontinence , usually frequency nocturia ' 2002 ICS Terminology Committee . A variety medical condition share symptom OAB , important exclude process diagnosis . Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) frequent alternative diagnosis . Even patient consider interstitial cystitis , OAB high probability diagnosis due insidious onset irritative symptoms.For reason , ICS Terminology Committee state term OAB use proven infection obvious pathology . Isolating causative organism urine culture play crucial role , likely reveal positive result less half patient present irritative symptom . Even though ordinary bacteria culture patient , evidence suggest atypical organism , genital mycoplasma , may associate OAB symptom . For example , 48 % patient chronic void symptom show positive culture Ureaplasma urealyticum Mycoplasma hominis . In 91 % patient positive culture , symptom severity frequency improve treatment . Another evidence mycoplasmal involvement OAB symptoms derive improvement symptoms two-thirds patient complain persistent frequency urgency use doxycyline effective U. urealyticum , M. hominis Chlamydia trachomatis . Mycoplasmas simple micro-organisms regarded true bacteria . They highly pleomorphic parasite human absence cell wall use distinguish mycoplasma place taxonomically class Mollicutes.Mycoplasmas generally view highly virulent , although usually manifest predilection particular host tissue , urogenital respiratory tract . It recognize organisms play important role human infection previously think . Its slow-growing , non-culturable nature enable establish chronic infection , resist effect antibiotic protect organism immune system reactivity.Accordingly , patient present irritative bladder symptom , especially whose first culture negative , culture may indicate test specifically Mycoplasma Chlamydia infection .</detailed_description>
