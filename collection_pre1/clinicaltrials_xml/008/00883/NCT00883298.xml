	<brief_title>Bi-weekly Temozolomide Plus Bevacizumab Adult Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II study combination Avastin temozolomide patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . Avastin administer intravenously dose 10 mg/kg day 1 15 every 28 day temozolomide administer dose 100 mg/m2 day 1-5 15-19 every 28 day ( one cycle ) . Patients baseline MRI , MRI scan first cycle every cycle . If evidence disease progression unacceptable toxicity , patient receive one year therapy . If evidence add benefit ( eg : tumor regression ) , patient stay treatment longer one year , per investigator discretion .</detailed_description>
