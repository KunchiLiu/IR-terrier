	<detailed_description>The course Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) characterize exacerbation lead significant clinical deterioration morbidity.COPD exacerbation characterize augmentation inflammation observe airway stable condition , particularly excessive accumulation polymorphonuclear neutrophils activation lymphocyte . It suggest abnormal increase inflammatory cell airways COPD patient exacerbation , might represent significant risk excessive proteolytic activity airways via release granule content extracellular environment . Large granular lymphocyte ( LGL ) include NK cytotoxic T- cell neutrophils contain cytolytic molecule , granzymes perforin . Therefore , inflammatory process exacerbation might potentially toxic lung . Notably , show sputum T-lymphocytes ( CD8+ ) patient stable COPD express perforin cytotoxic compare normal subject . However , previous investigation question role cytolytic molecule pathophysiology COPD . Moreover , despite considerable progress make understand underlying mechanism COPD , study investigate expression perforin granzymes COPD exacerbation . In present prospective investigation ass intracellular expression granzymes perforin neutrophil LGL cell onset sputum COPD patient use flow cytometry . Subjects protocol : COPD subject examine onset exacerbation stable condition . The definition exacerbation base criterion describe Anthonisen , require either presence least two major symptom ( increase dyspnea , sputum production , purulence ) one major symptom addition least one minor ( wheeze , cough , nasal discharge , sore throat , fever ) , two consecutive day . In addition ass expression granzymes perforin neutrophil LGL cell subject without COPD ( control ) recruit consecutive sampling among subject seek medical assistance clinic study period satisfy follow criterion : ) absence COPD , Asthma , pneumonia , evidence lung cancer , bronchiectasis , interstitial lung disease respiratory disease ii ) initiation symptom diagnostic respiratory infection past 72 hour , iii ) abstention new therapeutic intervention , iv ) absence sign suggestive condition require hospitalization . Control subject examine onset respiratory infection stable condition . The definition respiratory infection require presence one follow symptom dyspnea , sputum production , purulence , cough , ± fever , two consecutive day . Stable condition control define absence respiratory infection/exacerbation base symptom . The study approve Research Ethics Committee Hospital . Sputum induction process Sputum induced exacerbation respiratory infection stable condition ( least 8 week exacerbation ) patient control subject respectively ; sample process analysis inflammatory cell cytokines microbiology . Sputum induce via inhalation hypertonic saline solution aerosol ( Ultraneb 2000 ; DeVilbiss ; Somerset , PA ) . Antibody labeling : The following mouse anti-human monoclonal antibody use label sputum cell : phycoerythrin-conjugated antiCD3 ( PE-CD3 ) , phycoerythrin-5-conjugated ( antiCD4-PCy5 ) , fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-perforin-antibody , ( antiperforin-FITC ) fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugate also use competitive detection intracellular perforin granzymes . The `` intraprep kit '' ( Beckman-Coulter Inc Fullerton Ca , USA ) . Isotyping antibody mouse antimouse IgG use control ( Immunotech ; Marseille , France ) . For label cell surface antigens 1x106 cell suspension incubate normal bovine serum block unspecific binding ( block reagent ) , monoclonal antibody/ antibody add excess ( accord manufacturer 's instruction ) 45 min 10°C dark wash three time PBS plus 10 % FCS . For intracellular perforin granzymes stain , cell subsequently incubate permeabilization reagent ( Intraprep ; Beckman Coulter ; Fullerton , CA ) 10 min . As control , unlabeled antiperforin ( antigranzyme ) molar excess use permeabilization antiperforin ( antigranzyme ) FITC add without wash incubate 30 min room temperature ( competitive labeling ) . After stain , sample wash PBS plus 10 % FCS immediately analyze use flow cytometry . Flow Cytometric analysis : The sputum sample prepare described analyzed fluorescence activate cytometer ( EPICS ELITE ; Coultronics ; Louton , UK ) . Cells tightly gate volume complexity forward ( 0o ) side-light scattering ( 90o ) mode . At least 105 cell analyzed session . PCy-5-conjugated anti-human CD45 monoclonal antibody ( Dako ; Ely , UK ) use pan-leukocyte stain exclude non leukocyte event logical gating . The percentage one-color , two-color , three-color positive cell measure mean channel value well relative fluorescence intensity ( RFI ) correspond antigen density estimate . The QC-Combo Kit ( FCSC ; San Jun , Puerto Rico ) use quantification antibody bind day-to-day instrument calibration ( amplification compensation setting flow cytometer ) routinely carry . Gating perform accord forward side scatter CD45 expression . Positive cell within neutrophilic lymphocytic population measure percentage cell population . Following methodology ass expression perforin neutrophil LGL cell expression granzymes neutrophils LGL cell exacerbation stable COPD .</detailed_description>
