Participants Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) ( per World Health Organization [ WHO ] criterion ) treat insulin ≥24 month . Participants use insulin infusion pump basal insulin administration must device least 90 day prior screen . Body mass index ( BMI ) 18.0 35.0 kilogram per square meter ( kg/m^2 ) , inclusive . Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) ≤7.5 % base central laboratory screen result . Fasting Cpeptide &lt; 0.6 nanogram per milliliter ( ng/mL ) . Participants good general health base medical history physical examination without medical condition might prevent completion study drug injection assessment require protocol . Known suspected allergy component study drug study . Previous enrollment study . Participants fail Screening may attempt rescreen study . A participant proliferative retinopathy maculopathy , and/or severe neuropathy , particular autonomic neuropathy , judge Investigator . As judged Investigator , clinically significant active disease gastrointestinal , cardiovascular ( include history arrhythmia conduction delay electrocardiogram [ ECG ] ) , hepatic , neurological , renal , genitourinary , hematological system . As judged Investigator , uncontrolled hypertension ( diastolic blood pressure ≥100 millimeter mercury [ mmHg ] and/or systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg 5 minute supine position ) . Three attempt may perform measure blood pressure . History illness disease opinion Investigator might confound result study pose additional risk administer study drug participant . As judged Investigator , clinically significant finding routine laboratory data . Use drug ( systemic corticosteroid ) may interfere interpretation study result know cause clinically relevant interference insulin action , glucose utilization , recovery hypoglycemia . Recurrent severe hypoglycemia ( 2 episode last 6 month ) hypoglycemic unawareness , judge Investigator . Current addiction alcohol substance abuse , determine Investigator . Pregnancy , breastfeeding , intention become pregnant , use adequate contraceptive measure ( adequate contraceptive measure consist sterilization , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , oral injectable contraceptive , barrier method ) .
