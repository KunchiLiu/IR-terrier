	<brief_title>Influenza Vaccine HIV Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza virus infect 30 50 % child five year age course epidemic . The attack rate influenza virus associate illness infancy remain high , least 50 % influenza associate hospitalisation amongst child occur infant &lt; 6 month age . Approximately 33 % child would infect least first year life . The estimated attack rate child age 0-5 6-12 month influenza illness 12.4/100 20.3/100 child year respectively . Influenza virus cause LRTI amongst 89 % child infect 6-12 month age group . The risk influenza infection high amongst old child ( 2-5 year age ) ; however , risk develop LRTI ( 78 versus 2.5 per 100 child year ) great amongst young child ( &lt; 2 year age ) . In South Africa , burden influenza associate pneumonia characterize HIV infected child . The incidence severe pneumonia influenza virus identify 8.03 fold ( 95 % CI 5.05-12.76 ) great HIV infect compare HIV non-infected child ( 1 268 versus 148 per 100 000 child year ) age &lt; 2 year . These rate however provide conservative estimate burden influenza illness , since excludes child influenza illness hospitalize syndrome pneumonia well child manage outpatient . Furthermore , although duration hospitalization influenza associate pneumonia similar HIV infect HIV uninfected child ( median 4-5 day ) , statistically non-significant increase risk mortality among HIV infect child ( 8.0 % versus 2.2 % ; P=0.20 ) . Much difference morbidity mortality HIV infected individual influenza-associated pneumonia may due contribution co-existing pathogen . Recommendations make Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) advocate annual use subunit influenza vaccine HIV-1 infect child largely found theoretical concern regard potential severity influenza disease HIV-1 infect child . Although vaccination subunit influenza vaccine recommend HIV-1 infected child &gt; 6 month age , concern regard benefit vaccination child . These include addition poor immune response vaccine , particularly severely immunocompromised HIV-1 infected child , increase plasma HIV RNA follow vaccination describe . The increase plasma HIV RNA transient appear long-term clinical significance . Recently study , partly conflict result , undertaken evaluate immunogenicity influenza vaccination child antiretroviral therapy . However , study undertake Africa Asia burden paediatric HIV great . The routine use influenza vaccine HIV infect child remain low , partly relate lack adequate data regard burden influenza associate disease child well lack vaccine-efficacy data HIV infect child . Determining burden disease effectiveness influenza vaccine HIV infect child bear routine immunization recommendation well plan future influenza pandemic . Differences epidemiology HIV develop developed country prevalence HIV low high-burden sub-Saharan African country make necessary cautious extrapolate data recommendation develop country develop country . These difference may include : i. difference standard care , include access prophylaxis opportunistic infection use highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( HAART ) ; ii . difference risk disease opportunistic pathogen , e.g . Mycobacterium tuberculosis , etc . These difference may contribute difference risk severity influenza illness among HIV infect individual community well possibly responsiveness effectiveness vaccination . It within context study aim determine effectiveness influenza vaccination HIV infect child South Africa . The significance finding study help quantify burden influenza illness African HIV infect child , era HAART , well assist make informed recommendation use influenza vaccine HIV infect child guide national policy prepare future influenza virus-pandemic . 350 Patients recruit Chris Hani-Baragwanath Hospital , Soweto , South Africa onto prospective , double-blind , placebo randomise control trial evaluate efficacy tri-valent sub-unit influenza vaccine HIV infect child . Participants randomize receive either two dos Influenza sub-unit vaccine placebo one month apart , precede 2009 Influenza season . 100 child include immunogenicity cohort , blood drawn evaluate baseline influenza strain specific antibody level subsequent level one-month follow first second dos study vaccine . Study participant follow course influenza season , define start 1st May 2009 end 30th September 2009 . Subjects contact weekly determine whether fulfill criterion Influenza-like illness . Subjects fulfill criterion diagnose ILI request come clinic within 48 hour investigation , involve nasopharyngeal aspirate ( identification respiratory virus ) , nasopharyngeal swab ( identification Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization ) blood draw ( culture Streptococcus pneumoniae test ) .</detailed_description>
