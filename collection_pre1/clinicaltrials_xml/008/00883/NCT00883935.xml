	<brief_title>GSK1349572 Drug Interaction Study With Atazanavir/Ritonavir Atazanavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK1349572 integrase inhibitor evaluate treatment HIV infection . As GSK1349572 progress clinical trial HIV-infected patient combination antiretroviral therapy standard care , likely dosed protease inhibitor ( PIs ) include atazanavir/ritonavir ( ATV/RTV ) atazanavir alone . Ritonavir substrate CYP3A inhibitor CYP3A Pgp atazanavir inhibitor UGT1A1 . Ritonavir also know inducer CYP UGT enzymes . As GSK1349572 likely undergo metabolism CYP UGT enzymes Pgp substrate , drug interaction study GSK1349572 ATV warrant . GSK1349572 inhibitor inducer CYP3A expect impact pharmacokinetics ( PK ) atazanavir ritonavir . Accordingly , primary objective study compare steady-state plasma PK , safety tolerability GSK1349572 30 mg every 24h ( q24h ) without ATV/RTV 300/100 mg q24h ATV 400mg q24h . Approximately 24 subject receive GSK1349572 30mg q24h 5 day ( Treatment A ) . Subjects administer GSK1349572 30mg q24h combination either ATV/RTV 300/100 mg q24h ( Treatment B , n=12 ) ATV 400 mg q24h ( Treatment C , n=12 ) 14 day . There washout treatment . Safety evaluations serial PK sample collect treatment period . A follow-up visit occur 7-14 day last dose study drug . This study conduct one center US , healthy adult male female subject .</detailed_description>
