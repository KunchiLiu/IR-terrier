	<brief_title>Comparison Fetal Fibronectin ( fFN ) Specimen Collection Methodologies : With Speculum Versus Without Speculum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population include pregnant woman may risk preterm delivery require fFN test , determine doctor aid patient management . The subject may may present symptom related preterm labor must satisfy device 's approved labeling eligibility criterion . For pregnant woman sign labor , Fetal Fibronectin ( fFN ) test approve use aid ass risk preterm delivery ≤ 7 ≤ 14 day cervicovaginal sample collection intact amniotic membrane minimal cervical dilation ( &lt; 3 cm ) sample 24 week , 0 day 34 week , 6 day . It also approve use additional clinical information asymptomatic woman singleton pregnancy sample obtain routine prenatal visit 22 week , 0 day 30 week , 6 day gestation . The fFN test run The Rapid fFN TLiIQ® System positive fFN result occur concentration ≥50ng/mL negative fFN test concentration &lt; 50ng/mL . The current FDA-approved labeling collection fFN specimen require speculum examination ; however , collection fFN specimen often need woman first arrive hospital labor delivery unit , nurse often train credentialed perform speculum examination physician may readily available perform collection . Therefore , unmet need simple collection method . The test article study collection cervicovaginal sample fFN determination use standardize collection method without speculum . The control article study collection cervicovaginal sample fFN determination use approve collection method require speculum examination . Both test control fFN specimen sample collect evaluated use approved Rapid fFN TLiIQ® System . The primary objective study determine whether propose method fFN specimen collection without speculum substantially equivalent approve method speculum examination obtain gestational age ≥ 24 week ≤ 34 , 6 day symptomatic woman gestational age ≥ 22 week , 0 day ≤ 30 , 6 day asymptomatic woman . A finding substantial equivalency would support modification label allow collection specimen fFN determination without speculum examination . Hypothesis : The method fFN specimen collection without speculum inferior collection speculum within 5 % margin non-inferiority .</detailed_description>
