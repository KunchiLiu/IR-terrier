	<brief_title>Investigation Systemic Metal Ion Concentration Following Ceramic-on-metal Total Hip Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study compare systemic concentration cobalt chromium patient previously undergone total hip arthroplasty ceramic metal metal metal bearing surface . Secondary goal include assessment osteolysis radiograph , potential long term analysis implant survivability , cancer rate two patient population . Increased metal ion production document metal-on-metal arthroplasty articulation . There several concern metal ion production . First , even though decrease histiocytic response metallic debris , dose dependent cytotoxic response Interleukin 6 , Prostaglandin E2 , Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha persists may cause osteolysis long term . Second , increased level cobalt , chromium nickel show correlate increase cancer rate several animal model , carcinogenic risk human fully elucidate yet . Third , hypersensitivity reaction metal ion develop 25 % patient , 60 % patient poorly function hip . Ceramic metal avoid many problem due improve wear characteristic . If level metal ion production significantly reduce implant survivability proven long term study , articulation may become preferred method .</detailed_description>
