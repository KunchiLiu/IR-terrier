	<brief_summary>Children ( age 0-12 ) heart surgery often high risk develop complication continuously monitor . Part routine care UCLA include use monitor ( continuous central venous oxygen saturation-ScvO2 ) measure amount oxygen saturation tissue ( indirectly ) surgery intensive care unit . However , much data use effectiveness monitor comparison monitor use child . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness continuous central venous oxygen saturation ( ScvO2 ) monitor child compare monitor heart surgery . This observational study patient undergo research specific procedures operate room ( OR ) . The investigator observe record de-identified information , vital sign ( heart rate , blood pressure , etc . ) , evaluate importance monitor . This study also look demographic ( age , gender , diagnosis , etc . ) treatment ( type surgery ) receive child undergo heart surgery improve quality care . The investigator also observe parameter ICU . The investigator hypothesize low central venous saturation associate bad clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
