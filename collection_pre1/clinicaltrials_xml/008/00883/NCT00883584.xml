	<brief_summary>COPD lung disease lung damage , make hard breathe . In COPD , airways/tubes carry air lung partly obstruct , make difficult get air . COPD get gradually bad time . At moment cure COPD . The best way slow disease stop smoking . Current medication use alleviate shortness breath cough , treat infection lung worsen COPD . Institute Medicinal Molecular Design , Inc. ( IMMD ) , Japanese Drug Discovery Company develop compound code name IMD-1041 . IMD-1041 investigational drug , mean yet market . It IKKb inhibitor develop treatment COPD . Unlike medication use COPD currently , IMD-1041 capsule form need take twice day . It also unlike drug use treat underlie cause symptom . The purpose study see IMD-1041 ability reduce inflammatory derive symptom airway remodelling ( change ) look certain change chemical level blood sputum ( phlegm ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IMD-1041 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease : Proof Concept ( POC ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The dose level IMD 1041 select base previous clinical trial . The dose study , 400mg , consider efficacious , supported clinical data healthy subject type 2 diabetic patient . Single oral dos 800 mg multiple oral dos 400 mg twice daily IMD-1041 show safe well tolerate healthy subject . Twice daily dose 200 mg IMD-1041 show safe well tolerate give diabetic patient 12 week . A placebo ( dummy medication ) arm select consider reliable method minimise patient investigator bias current COPD guideline suggest useful comparison would placebo . Exposure placebo allow reliable evaluation IMD 1041 , well adverse event cause drug compare result COPD natural course . All patient able remain current medication apart theophylline expect effect IKK beta . The current treatment COPD include medication mechanism action , 's main aim reduce inflammatory fibrotic change cause symptom current standard COPD medication treat . The study last 12-14 week , include 7 day screen period , visit 0 baseline/randomisation visit , visit 1 visit 3 study spec test , visit 2 4/follow either site telephone contact check subject compliance adverse event . Prior selection Investigator evaluate eligibility patient entry trial review patient ' medical record inclusion/exclusion criterion specify protocol . There potential pre-screening visit 3 week prior randomisation . This visit applicable patient need stop medication theophylline need stop 2 week prior screen . At visit potential patient provide information study activity requirement . After sign informed consent form patient ask stop medication return study site screen least 2 week visit . All patient attend clinical site initial screen 7 day prior randomisation . If patient 'pre-screened ' described , give information pertain study activity requirement . After sign informed consent form evaluation perform confirm patient ' eligibility accord study protocol . The patient ' medical history , physical examination , clinical laboratory test , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) tracing , blood pressure , pregnancy screening ( woman child bear potential ) perform . Blood take routine clinical laboratory test . Following successful screening , patient return site seven day ( least 1 day ) screen visit randomisation . There 50:50 chance patient randomise either IMD 1041 placebo whichever remain duration study . The following happen prior randomisation : - Patient ask current health problem , adverse event change concomitant medication since screening . - Vitals sign - Blood take clinical lab evaluation biomarker sample - Lung function - Induced sputum biomarker sample - 2 questionnaire complete Following evaluation patient randomised medication dispense . ( A total 280 tablet dispense , equate 4 week supply , plus 56 tablet spar case loss delay next visit . ) Visit 1 occur 4 week visit 0 ( +/- 2 day ) . At visit follow occur : - Patient ask current health problem , adverse event change concomitant medication since screening . - vitals sign - Blood take clinical lab evaluation , PK analysis biomarker sample - Lung function - Induced sputum biomarker sample - Medication dispense . A total either 4 ( 224 ) 8 ( 448 ) week supply dispense depend whether attend clinical site visit 3 . Visit 2 occur 4 week visit 1 ( +/- 3 day ) . This visit either site telephone decide Principal Investigator case-by-case basis . At visit follow occur : - Patient ask current health problem , adverse event change concomitant medication since screening . - Medication dispense . A total 4 week supply ( 224 tablet ) dispense patient attend site visit . Visit 3 occur 4 week visit 2 ( +/- 3 day ) . At visit follow occur : - Patient ask current health problem , adverse event change concomitant medication since screening . - vitals sign - Blood take clinical lab evaluation , PK analysis biomarker sample - Lung function - Induced sputum biomarker sample - 2 questionnaire complete - All medication return final accountability document Visit 4 , follow visit via telephone occur 2 week visit 3 ( +/- 3 day ) . The following occur : - Patient ask current health problem , adverse event change concomitant medication since screening .</detailed_description>
