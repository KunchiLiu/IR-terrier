	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) acute lung injury ( ALI ) medical condition occur severe inflammation increase fluid lung , make difficult lung function properly . Hospital treatment person ALI/ARDS often include use breathing machine , ventilator , person able breathe without assistance . Initiating proper nutrition feed tube early person 's hospital stay may help improve recovery , optimal timing , composition , amount feeding treatment remain unknown . This study evaluate whether early delay full-calorie feed feed tube effective reduce recovery time increase survival rate people ALI/ARDS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Versus Delayed Enteral Feeding Treat People With Acute Lung Injury Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( The EDEN Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALI/ARDS involve extensive inflammation lung lead rapid respiratory failure . These condition commonly cause pneumonia , generalize infection , severe trauma lung , also less commonly cause smoke salt water inhalation , drug overdose , shock . For people , ALI/ARDS resolve without treatment , many severe case result hospitalization intensive care unit ( ICU ) , 30 % 40 % case end mortality . Current treatment ALI/ARDS include assist breathing ventilator , supportive care , management underlying cause . Enteral feeding , patient receive nutrition feeding tube , play important role treatment , . Some recent study show enteral feeding initiate soon patient begin assist breathe associate short hospital stay well chance survival delayed enteral feeding . However , study show opposite , study optimal feed volume composition show conflicting result . This study evaluate effect early versus delay full-calorie enteral feeding mortality , ventilator-free day , ICU-free day , organ failure people ALI/ARDS . Upon admission ICU , dietary evaluation do participant determine goal , full-calorie , feed rate , base body weight daily energy consumption . Participants also undergo baseline assessment procedure , include vital sign measurement , blood draw , frontal chest radiograph , ventilator setting , placement feed tube . Participants randomly assign receive initial enteral feeding either minimal ( trophic ) full-calorie . All participant begin enteral feeding within 6 hour treatment assignment . Participants assign initial minimal enteral feeding receive feeding 10 cubic centimeter ( cc ) per hour , continue rate 144 hour , provide participant remain ventilator . After 144 hour , feed rate advance full-calorie rate . Participants assign initial full-calorie enteral feeding receive feeding 25 cc per hour , feed rate increase 25 cc per hour every 6 hour goal rate reach . During enteral feeding , gastric residual volume ( GRVs ) check every 6 12 hour assure acceptable level . Participants complete enteral feeding upon hospital discharge , Day 28 treatment , death , ability achieve 48 hour unassisted breathing . Blood pressure , heart rate , ventilation setting , various blood factor measure treatment . Phone-based follow-up assessment occur Months 6 12 ICU discharge include measurement health-related quality life ; psychological , neurocognitive , physical activity outcome ; healthcare utilization ; mortality .</detailed_description>
