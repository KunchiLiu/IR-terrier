	<detailed_description>Informed consent obtain patient include study , explanation nature disease possible treatment . This study approve local ethical committee . The patient randomize three group . The randomization achieve computer-generated schedule result seal 60 envelope . The responsible surgeon open randomly envelop , accordingly protocol . Group 1 : consists 20 ( 14 male 6 female ) patient underwent house door flap . Group II : consist 20 patient ( 16 male 4 female ) underwent romboid flap . Group III : consist 20 patient underwent V-Y anoplasty ( 13 male 7 female ) . In group I : house flap healthy tissue incise depth ischiorectal fat . The flap consist skin subcutaneous tissue . The flap sufficiently mobilize without undermine fatty base contain perforate blood vessel . The flap loose easily advance anal canal . When `` base '' house-shaped flap advance anal canal defect , fix top excise area 3/0 Vicryl suture . In group II : rhomboid flap incise ischiorectal fossa mobilize without undermine fatty base anal canal tip rhomboid flap suture top strictured area use vicryl 3/0 . In group III : V-Y anoplasty perform make v shape incision perianal skin posteriorly start low end wound resultant excision scar area . A V-shaped flap dissect preservation fatty base .The V flap advance anal canal tip suture top structured area use vicryel 3/0 . Patients discharge 48 hour procedure . A high-fiber diet combine bulk laxative oral antibiotic coverage recommend discharge . After bowel movement , cleanse operative site sitz bath shower prescribe . Patients discharge 48 hour procedure . A high-fiber diet combine bulk laxative oral antibiotic coverage recommend discharge . After bowel movement , cleanse operative site sitz bath shower prescribe . The parameter investigate time relief painful defecation , strain severity , sensation incomplete evacuation need laxative enema . postoperative anal caliber , heal rate , recurrence , quality life ( QOL ) assess Gastrointestinal quality life index ( GIQLI ) relatively new validated tool measure QOL patient gastrointestinal disease . The GIQLI develop Eypasch coworkers ( 6 ) . The questionnaire comprise 36 multidimensional item cover symptom physical , emotional , social dysfunction relate gastrointestinal disease treatment . Each item score 0 4 point . The GIQLI score calculate simple addition item score overall score 0 would constitute bad , score 144 ( 36 X 4 ) represent best possible result . It also possible evaluate disease-specific , social , psychologic , physical item separate subgroup . The patient ask complete GIQLI questionnaire admission hospital one year surgery supervision independent author .</detailed_description>
