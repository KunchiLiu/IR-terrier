	<brief_summary>Scleroderma rare , long-term autoimmune disease normal tissue replace dense , thick fibrous tissue . Normally , immune system help defend body disease infection . In people scleroderma , immune system trigger fibroblast cell produce much protein collagen . The extra collagen becomes deposit skin organ , cause harden thicken similar scarring process . Although scleroderma often affect skin , also affect part body , include lung , severe form scleroderma life-threatening . Scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease one example life-threatening scleroderma condition . In people symptomatic scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease , scar occurs delicate lung tissue , compromise lung function . The purpose study determine whether people symptomatic scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease experience respiratory benefit treatment 2-year course mycophenolate mofetil treatment 1-year course oral cyclophosphamide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Therapeutic Regimens Scleroderma Interstitial Lung Disease ( The Scleroderma Lung Study II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Interstitial lung disease describe condition lung tissue become scarred inflamed . Interstitial lung disease cause scleroderma , specifically see progressive pulmonary fibrosis , occur approximately 40 percent patient scleroderma emerge lead overall cause death . In previous study , Scleroderma Lung Study I ( SLS I ) , investigator evaluate 1-year cyclophosphamide ( CYC ) treatment people scleroderma-related interstitial lung disease . The study result demonstrate statistically significant improvement force vital capacity , total lung capacity , dyspnea , Rodnan skin score , several measure quality life . However , patient follow another year complete CYC therapy , beneficial effect CYC wan longer significant 24-month follow-up . Preliminary information suggest alternative immunosuppressive medication , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , may effective treat disease , give long period , result few side effect . This study , Scleroderma Lung Study II ( SLS II ) , compare safety efficacy 2-year treatment MMF versus 1-year treatment CYC . Specifically , investigator determine whether MMF produce similar well improvement lung capacity few side effect throughout entire 2-year period . Participation include 21 study visit 2-year period . Eligible participant randomly assign receive either MMF twice daily 2 year CYC daily 1 year , follow placebo 1 year . Blood urine sample collect every 2 week first 2 month month remainder study . Every 3 month , participant attend study visit include pulmonary function test , blood urine sampling , physical exam , questionnaires current health medication . At final study visit , participant also undergo high resolution computerize tomography ( HRCT ) scan possibly punch biopsy .</detailed_description>
