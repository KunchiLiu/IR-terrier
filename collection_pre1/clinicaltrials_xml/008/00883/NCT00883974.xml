	<brief_summary>Immediately follow birth , preterm infant face period stressful environmental input , may negative consequence early brain development subsequent neurobehavioral outcome . This study aim assess effectiveness training parent reduce stressful experience early life . The investigator hypothesize intervention would insulate preterm infant harmful effect acute chronic stress , turn would result enhanced brain development . The primary aim current study investigate intervention associate improved brain development measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) term-equivalent age . A secondary aim ass possible short-term medical benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sensitivity Training For Parents Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomize control trial parental sensitivity training program involve 45 woman infant born &lt; 30 week gestational age . The intervention consist 10 individual session Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) . Post-intervention , term-equivalent age ( 40 week postmenstrual age ) , magnetic resonance ( MR ) image perform evaluate brain structure development . Quantitative volumetric technique use estimate overall regional brain volume different tissue type include cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , cortical grey matter ( CGM ) , deep nuclear grey matter ( DNGM ) , unmyelinated white matter ( UWM ) myelinated white matter ( MWM ) . Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) use evaluate integrity maturation white matter apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) fractional anisotropy ( FA ) .</detailed_description>
