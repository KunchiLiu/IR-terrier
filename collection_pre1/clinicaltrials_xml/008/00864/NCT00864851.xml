	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Several Replagal Dosing Regimens Cardiac Function Adults With Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fabry disease inherit , metabolic disease cause mutation GALA gene . Patients Fabry disease accumulate complex glycosphingolipid name globotriaosylceramide ( Gb3 ) various tissue organ . All organ affect Fabry disease majority morbidity mortality cause cardiac , renal neurological dysfunction . Accumulation Gb3 heart cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , valvular abnormality , arrhythmias infarction . Replagal show reduce Gb3 key tissue organ , stabilize renal function patient Fabry disease . Evidence suggest Replagal reduces leave ventricular mass ( LVM ) improve midwall fractional shortening ( MFS ) heart . Left ventricular hypertrophy major cause morbidity mortality patient Fabry disease . This study safety effectiveness 3 dosing regimen Replagal adult patient leave ventricular hypertrophy due Fabry disease . The primary objective study compare effect 2 dose regimen Replagal ( 0.2 mg/kg IV every week 0.2 mg/kg IV weekly ) reduction leave ventricular mass measure echocardiography . The secondary objective study compare effect 2 dose regimen Replagal ( 0.2 mg/kg IV every week 0.2 mg/kg IV weekly ) follow : exercise tolerance ; improvement disease-specific quality life heart failure patient ; improvement heart failure symptom ; magnitude reduction Gb3 ; rate decline renal function improvement severity proteinuria/albuminuria ; safety . An alternative treatment regimen 0.4 mg/kg Replagal IV weekly also explore without formal comparison 0.2 mg/kg regimen . The investigation safety efficacy 0.4 mg/kg IV weekly regimen secondary objective study .</detailed_description>
