	<detailed_description>Patients receive neoadjuvant sorafenib ( investigational agent ) combination preoperative external beam conformal radiotherapy ( 50 Gy 25 fraction ) localize , large soft tissue sarcoma extremity body wall prior resection curative intent . Sorafenib FDA-approved target agent patient renal cell carcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma . Preliminary data suggest activity sorafenib soft tissue sarcoma metastatic setting . Limited data available regard safety efficacy sorafenib combination radiotherapy . The Phase I portion trial seek establish safety sorafenib radiotherapy neoadjuvant set soft tissue sarcoma extremity body wall . The Phase II portion trial aim determine pathologic near-complete/complete response rate ( ≥ 95 % tumor necrosis ) multimodality therapy . Molecular dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI study seek establish correlative biological image marker response and/or resistance therapy . Significant challenge exist treatment patient soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) extremity body wall . Major therapeutic goal patient include local disease-control , maximization limb function , avoidance therapeutic morbidity . The standard approach patient STS base radical resection wide margin combination external beam radiation . Although local control rate set range 85 90 % , patient remain risk substantial morbidity multimodality therapy . Furthermore , despite effective local therapy surgery radiation , approximately 50 % patient high grade STS die disease within 5 year diagnosis . Experimental data experience solid tumor suggest significant synergistic effect anti-angiogenic targeted therapy , sorafenib , combine radiotherapy ( RT ) . Overproduction angiogenic factor tumor vasculature lead disordered/poorly regulate tumor perfusion appear normalize following delivery anti-angiogenic agent . This , turn , allow improved delivery susceptibility cytotoxic agent , particularly important RT since hypoxia key mechanism resistance modality . Preliminary clinical data rectal cancer malignant brain tumor demonstrate promising result combination anti-angiogenic agent RT respect downstaging primary tumor , local tumor control , improve progression-free survival . Angiogenic factor upregulated patient STS , anti-angiogenic agent demonstrate activity STS metastatic setting . Consequently , propose evaluate preoperative combine modality sorafenib conformal RT patient STS extremity body wall prospective Phase I/II clinical trial . Key endpoint safety toxicity Phase I trial pathological response Phase II trial . Additional endpoint include molecular functional image correlative study biomarkers response resistance treatment . We hypothesize combination safe increase pathologic necrosis within primary tumor time surgical resection , translate reduce volume resect tissue , improved local disease-control , ultimately improve disease-free survival . Functional image study ( dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ) molecular examination pre- post-treatment tumor tissue serum allow correlation change tumor blood flow , hypoxia transcription factor , phosphorylated ERK , angiogenic marker degree tumor necrosis follow treatment preoperative sorafenib radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
