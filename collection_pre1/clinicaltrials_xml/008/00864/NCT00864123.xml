	<detailed_description>Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) proven efficacy treatment pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . Yet , CBT help child benefit often remain symptomatic upon treatment completion . The behavioral theory underlies CBT base two component , namely fear condition extinction . On neural level , CBT incorporate similar mechanism involve fear conditioning . Antagonists N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) glutamatergic receptor , involve learning memory , block fear learn extinction . Evidence suggest D-Cycloserine ( DCS ) , partial agonist NMDA glutamate receptor , augments associative learn extinction form learning animal human . Recent clinical trial adult anxiety disorder ( acrophobia social phobia ) provide support DCS dose facilitate associative learning occur exposure-based psychotherapy . Given CBT base principle extinction , DCS may augment CBT youth OCD , anxiety disorder conceptually similar acrophobia . With mind , I propose undertake randomize , double-blind placebo control pilot study DCS determine whether short-term clinical benefit CBT youth OCD . Forty child adolescent ( age 8-17 ) primary diagnosis OCD screen , meet relevant criterion , randomly assign one two treatment condition : ( 1 ) CBT plus DCS ( 25 50mg depend weight ) , ( 2 ) CBT plus placebo . All patient receive 10 session CBT base protocol use POTS ( 2004 ) . Participants take DCS placebo 1 hour prior therapy session . A blinded , independent evaluator ass participant 3 separate time point . Two assessment ( Baseline , Post-treatment ) comprehensive nature ( e.g. , diagnostic interview , self-reports , CY-BOCS , laboratory test ) , whereas one midpoint assessment involve administration CY-BOCS , CGI , CGI-S , Adverse Symptom Checklist . Results study may powerful clinical implication provide preliminary support pharmalogical agent enhance effectiveness standard E/RP . Such agent may utility improve outcome , reduce premature therapy termination , target patient treatment refractory .</detailed_description>
