	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine sunitinib get past blood-brain barrier brain tumor . Sunitinib show promising result treat cancer work block blood flow tumor , may prevent grow . At present time , chemotherapy cure glioblastoma . The reason chemotherapy fully effective many drug penetrate brain tumor . This due presence blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) normally protect brain substance blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants take study drug , sunitinib , 7 day prior surgery . The surgery part routine care glioblastoma perform Day 8 . The study drug supply capsule form take home . - On Day 7 participant come clinic follow test procedure perform : Neurological physical examination ; vital sign ; blood sample . On day 9 ( day surgery ) MRI scan perform . - Fourteen day participant surgery ( Day 22 ) , restart sunitinib treatment . They take study drug day 4 week follow 2 week rest period ( study drug treatment ) . This 6 week period call cycle study treatment . Participants continue receive cycle study treatment long disease progress experience serious side-effects . - Before new cycle study treatment ( every 6 week ) participant come clinic follow test : Neurological physical examination ; vital sign ; blood sample ; urine sample ; MRI scan brain ( do every even cycle ) .</detailed_description>
