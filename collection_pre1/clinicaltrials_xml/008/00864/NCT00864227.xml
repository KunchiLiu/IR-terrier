	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Effectiveness Umbilical Cord Blood Stem Cell Transplant ( BMT CTN 0604 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Leukemia lymphoma type blood cancer . Chemotherapy common treatment option people type cancer , cancer respond well chemotherapy , cancer return , people may need consider option . A bone marrow transplant , type stem cell transplant healthy bone marrow donate patient relate unrelated donor , commonly use treat leukemia lymphoma . Recently , stem cell transplant use umbilical cord blood become viable option treat type cancer . Traditionally , umbilical cord blood , blood leave placenta baby bear , disposed placenta . However , past year , doctor begin collect freeze umbilical cord blood cell may use stem cell transplant procedure later time . Typically , people undergo stem cell transplant receive high dos chemotherapy transplant prepare body accept donor stem cell . In study , participant undergo new type stem cell transplant call nonmyeloablative transplant , reduce intensity method transplantation require high dos chemotherapy . The purpose study examine safety effectiveness nonmyeloablative stem cell transplant use umbilical cord blood treatment option people leukemia lymphoma . This study enroll people leukemia lymphoma . Participants admit hospital first receive type chemotherapy call cyclophosphamide , give intravenously sixth day transplant . In addition , another type chemotherapy , fludarabine , give intravenously day 5 day transplant . Three day transplant , participant receive cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , help prevent body reject stem cell help decrease risk develop complication call graft-versus-host-disease ( GVHD ) , attack donor cell body 's normal tissue . Some participant may receive tacrolimus instead cyclosporine . After 6 day , participant receive small dose radiation . The next day , participant undergo umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant . Participants remain hospital approximately 2 3 month total , possibly longer complication . Beginning first day transplant , participant receive daily injection growth factor call granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) , natural protein increase white blood cell count ; G-CSF continue participant 's white blood cell count normal . Participants continue receive MMF 30 day cyclosporine tacrolimus 180 day transplant . While participant hospital , blood sample collect regularly evaluate response possible side effect treatment , include GVHD . If necessary , participant receive platelet red blood cell transfusion . At follow-up study visit 6 month 1 year transplant , blood sample obtain . Study researcher keep track participant ' medical condition phone call mailing participant doctor year rest participant ' life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must 21 70 year old ; participant 1 21 year old also eligible ineligible BMT CTN # 0501 ( NCT00412360 ) Each unit must supply minimum 1.5 x 10^7/kg precryopreserved nucleate cell dose Participants must two partially human leucocyte antigen ( HLA ) match umbilical cord blood unit . Each unit must match minimum 4 6 HLAA , B , DRB1 locus recipient . This may include 0 2 antigen mismatch A B ( antigen level ) DRB1 ( allele level ) locus . Each unit must 4 6 HLAA , B , DRB1 antigen match , necessarily loci recipient . All type do use molecular typing . Though molecular level type available , match define intermediate resolution HLAA B high resolution DRB1 study . An adult unrelated donor search require person eligible study clinical situation dictate urgent transplant . Clinical urgency define 6 8 week referral transplant center low likelihood find match , unrelated donor .
