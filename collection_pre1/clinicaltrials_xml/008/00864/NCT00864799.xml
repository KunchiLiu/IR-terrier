In study investigator aim evaluate three misoprostol regimens second trimester pregnancy termination follow mifepristone prim primary intention develop protocol result delivery rate within 24 hour 95 % woman gestation &lt; 24 week . Secondary aim study assess incidence maternal side-effects three regimen , placental retention rate need curettage retain placental tissue .
