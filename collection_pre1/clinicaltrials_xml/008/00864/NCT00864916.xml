	<brief_summary>People infect HIV great risk develop cardiovascular disease people infect HIV . This may due increase inflammation blood vessel .

	<brief_title>Pentoxifylline Combination Antiretroviral Therapy Improve Blood Vessel Function HIV-Infected People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People infected HIV increase risk cardiovascular disease , lead cause death HIV . This may due increase inflammation blood vessel , often observe HIV-infected people lead endothelial dysfunction—a condition involve malfunction thin layer cell line interior surface blood vessel . Endothelial dysfunction increase risk develop atherosclerosis cardiovascular disease . Much focus cause HIV-related endothelial dysfunction center use several type antiretroviral medication use treat HIV infection . However , recent data suggest new protease inhibitor , type antiretroviral medication , associate endothelial dysfunction new combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) regimens result initial improvement endothelial dysfunction . Yet , preliminary research also show people receive cART , risk endothelial dysfunction fact persist time , suggest mechanism viral control , notably inflammation , play role endothelial dysfunction . Pentoxifylline medication currently use reduce leg pain people blockage blood vessel legs . Previous research show pentoxifylline may improve blood vessel function reduce inflammation people infect HIV , research need confirm benefit . The purpose study compare safety effectiveness pentoxifylline cART versus cART alone improve endothelial function reduce inflammation HIV-infected people . This study enroll people infect HIV start receive cART . At baseline study visit , participant undergo medical history review ; physical examination ; measurement blood pressure , heart rate , height , weight , temperature , waist , hip ; blood urine collection . An ultrasound imaging test arm measure blood vessel function . Participants randomly assign receive either pentoxifylline placebo three time day 48 week . All participant also receive cART medication , prescribe primary HIV doctor . At study visit Weeks 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 48 , participant undergo repeat baseline measurement ; however , ultrasound test occur Weeks 8 , 24 , 48 .</detailed_description>

Fever 48 hour study visit require postponement study visit participant 's temperature lower 38.0 C least 48 hour ; fever continue past allow study visit timeframe result study discontinuation . Therapy acute infection serious medical illness ( besides HIV infection ) within 14 day prior screen . Note : Therapy acute infection serious medical illness overlap main study visit result postponement study visit course therapy complete ; postponement outside allow study visit timeframe result study discontinuation . Pregnancy breastfeed course study . Hypotension , define systolic blood pressure &lt; 90mmHg , time screen . Note : Hypotension note prior brachial artery reactivity test main study visit result study visit postponement least one day systolic pressure ≥ 90mmHg morning brachial reactivity test ; postponement outside allow study visit timeframe result study discontinuation . Uncontrolled hypertension , define confirm systolic blood pressure &gt; 160mmHg screening ( regardless use antihypertensive medication ) .
