	<brief_summary>The motor cortex brain change follow chronic pain injury , link pain-associated change motor behaviour . This study aim investigate whether therapeutic exercise patient chronic pain induce reorganisation motor cortex restore normal motor behaviour . The investigator hypothesise motor training induce reorganisation motor cortex change relate improved motor behaviour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Motor Cortex Following Exercises Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sensory motor system reorganize follow injury learn new motor skill . Recently observe adaptive change motor cortical organization patient chronic back pain , closely link change motor behavior . Although pain-related alteration behavior train associate improved symptom , remain unclear whether meaningful functional outcome related motor cortical reorganization . Here investigate effect two intervention people chronic back pain : skilled motor train control intervention self-paced walking exercise . We measure motor cortical excitability ( motor threshold ( MT ) ) organization ( center gravity ( CoG ) map volume ) deep abdominal muscle , transversus abdominis ( TrA ) , use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . In addition , motor behavior TrA assess single rapid arm movement . The study help elucidate mechanism specific motor exercise chronic back pain management .</detailed_description>
