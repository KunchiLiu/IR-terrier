	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , dose-escalation study bendamustine lenalidomide ( BL ) also bendamustine , lenalidomide , rituximab ( BLR ) relapsed/refractory CLL relapsed/refractory B-cell lymphoma . Phase I dose escalation do independently CLL NHL group . In addition , study conduct 2 part . In part I study , maximum tolerate dose bendamustine lenalidomide determine independently CLL NHL group . In part II study , CLL NHL subject enrol MTD BL determine Part I CLL NHL subject receive rituximab . Part II study determine MTD BLT independently NHL CLL group .</detailed_description>
