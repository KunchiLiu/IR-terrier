	<brief_summary>The investigator seek determine whether brain imaging technique use help detect depression , assess severity , and/or monitor predict response treatment . Subjects minor major depression randomly assign wait-list control group treatment new computer-based cognitive behavior therapy develop Dr. James Cartriene . Brain imaging perform treatment use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . The investigator hypothesize brain activity , particularly lateral frontal area brain , provide biomarkers depression , depression severity , treatment response .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depression significantly disrupt one 's ability function effectively efficiently , associate performance deficit seriously jeopardize space mission success . The incidence serious depression Earth base analogue spaceflight environment report 13 % per person per year . Extrapolating exist report depressive episode short-duration spaceflight , depression thus probable condition one member five seven person crew long duration spaceflight ( e.g. , 30 month mission Mars ) . Mission success jeopardize depression either directly , potentially life threaten consequence lapse performance , indirectly , add workload stress crewmembers . The likelihood potentially serious consequence depression spaceflight explains risk human performance failure due mood alteration depression , anxiety , psychiatric cognitive problem Priority 1 risk mission type ( International Space Station , Moon , Mars ) . Certain countermeasure already place : medication psychological consultation ground-crews . However , current in-flight method decide whether countermeasure use rely heavily subjective self-reports . The biological basis mood disorder suggest neural biomarkers may provide objective method assess depression . Aim 1 proposal , therefore , seek identify neural biomarkers sensitive , specific , depression . These measure use evaluate validate flight-capable , noninvasive neuroimaging technology ( near-infrared spectroscopy imaging , NIRS image ) ability detect biomarkers depression severity . As initial step towards develop novel select-out criterion , Aim 2 evaluate neural biomarkers appear promise detect endophenotype identifies individual heighten risk treatment resistance . Finally , depression objectively identify , appropriate countermeasure need select . Aim 3 focus ability brain imaging help predict efficacy Dr. Cartriene 's computer base problem solve therapy .</detailed_description>
