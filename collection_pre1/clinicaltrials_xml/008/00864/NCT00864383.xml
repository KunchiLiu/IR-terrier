	<brief_summary>REMoxTB study `` Rapid Evaluation Moxifloxacin treatment sputum smear positive tuberculosis '' . REMoxTB aim find evaluate new drug regimens shorten duration tuberculosis therapy . The purpose REMoxTB evaluate efficacy , safety acceptability two moxifloxacin-containing treatment combination determine whether substitute ethambutol moxifloxacin one combination , and/or substitute isoniazid moxifloxacin another combination , make possible reduce duration treatment TB .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Controlled Comparison Two Moxifloxacin Containing Treatment Shortening Regimens Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current recommend treatment tuberculosis ( TB ) require patient take multiple drug six eight month . Because course therapy long , many patient adhere treatment consequence poor outcome . In case either sputum clear bacteria cause tuberculosis , disease return ( call relapse ) . Response medication monitor treatment collect regular sputum sample examine sample culture , organism cause tuberculosis . The commonly use drug treat tuberculosis rifampicin , isoniazid , ethambutol pyrazinamide . Previous study animal human suggest new drug call moxifloxacin may also effective treatment tuberculosis . Moreover , promise laboratory study mice suggest moxifloxacin may enable total duration chemotherapy reduce four month , would significant improvement patient take medication tuberculosis . This study involve comparison design ass whether substitute moxifloxacin individual drug exist treatment combination enable tuberculosis treatment shorten . Patients select study allocate one three treatment group . The first group give six month standard treatment . A second group receive moxifloxacin substitute ethambutol , part four month regimen , see whether short treatment inferior standard six month treatment . The third group receive moxifloxacin substitute isoniazid , part four month regimen , see whether short treatment inferior standard six month treatment . Hypotheses : 1 . In treatment-naïve adult active pulmonary TB treat eight week moxifloxacin ( M ) , isoniazid ( H ) , rifampicin ( R ) pyrazinamide ( Z ) ( i.e . standard regimen moxifloxacin substitute ethambutol ( E ) ) , follow nine week moxifloxacin , isoniazid rifampicin , follow nine week placebo , proportion patient experience treatment failure disease relapse twelve month follow treatment completion inferior observe patient treated standard regimen ( eight week ethambutol , isoniazid , rifampicin pyrazinamide follow eighteen week isoniazid plus rifampicin ) ( Comparison 1 ) . 2 . In treatment-naïve adult active pulmonary TB treat eight week ethambutol , moxifloxacin , rifampicin pyrazinamide ( i.e . standard regimen moxifloxacin substitute isoniazid ) , follow nine week moxifloxacin rifampicin follow nine week placebo , proportion patient experience treatment failure disease relapse twelve month follow treatment completion inferior observe patient treated standard regimen ( eight week ethambutol , isoniazid , rifampicin pyrazinamide follow eighteen week isoniazid plus rifampicin ) ( Comparison 2 ) .</detailed_description>
