	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic Radiation Dosimetry Study Evaluating 99m TC-EC-DG SPECT/CT Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Male female patient least 18 year old untreated Non-small Cell Lung Cancer non-incisional biopsy definitive evidence disease ( cytology result bronchoscope procedure confirm NSCLC ) previously certify ( per Centers Medicare Medicaid Services requirement ) physician consent study . The study consist screen visit , gold-standard 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging follow investigational agent 99mTc-EC-DG SPECT/CT ( PET/CT perform part pre-study activity qualify PET camera study , SPECT/CT must do within 45 day PET/CT imaging procedure ) . The study procedure perform within 5-7 day sign informed consent . During 99mTc-EC-DG SPECT/CT visit study , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) blood draws urine collection take radiation dosimetry ( Planar Imaging ) perform specified time point post 99mTc-EC-DG injection . Patients see 24 hour 99mTc-EC-DG injection safety final PK blood urine collection . A 21-day follow-up period ( SPECT/CT image ) allow investigator acquire additional imaging , surgical , pathology treatment documentation ( actual patient visit require 21 day follow-up time point ) .</detailed_description>

Postmenopausal define least 12 month natural spontaneous amenorrhea , least 6 week follow surgical menopause ( bilateral oophorectomy ) ; Females childbearing potential male female sexual partner childbearing potential must agree use one follow acceptable birth control method : 1 . Surgically sterile ( hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ) ; 2 . Surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation surgery least 6 week prior study initiation ) . Documentation require ; 3 . Intrauterine device ( IUD ) place least 3 month ; 4 . Doublebarrier method ( condom diaphragm ) spermicide least 14 day prior screen study completion ; 5 . Stable hormonal contraceptive ( oral , topical , vaginal implanted/injected ) least 3 month prior study study completion ; 6 . Abstinence ; 7 . Singlebarrier method least 14 day prior screen though study completion vasectomize male female vasectomized partner ; Have fast blood glucose le 200 mg/dL screening ; Have report clinical symptom consistent confirm diagnosis NSCLC ; Be able tolerate SPECT/CT PET/CT image . This include : Laying position without move approximately 45 minute ; Able tolerate claustrophobic area ; Ability hold arm overhead approximately 45 minute ; Be able fast prior SPECT/CT PET/CT imaging , length fast dependent time scan : A morning scan ( 08:0012:00 ) require fast midnight ( per site 's fasting/diet restriction ) ; An afternoon scan ( 12:00onward ) require minimum 6 hour fast ( per site 's fasting/diet restriction ) ; Be able eat high protein/low carbohydrate meal last meal SPECT/CT PET/CT imaging ( per site 's fasting/diet restriction ) ; Be able make schedule appointment within designated time window [ PET/CT image within 7 day qualify study , second imaging session SPECT/CT image 1 3 day initial imaging visit , least 24 hour PET/CT SPECT/CT imaging ( PET/CT perform part prestudy activity qualify PET camera study , SPECT/CT must do within 45 day PET/CT image procedure ) ] ; Have safety laboratory value opinion Investigator place patient undue risk patient participate study . This include ( limited ) : Alanine aminotransferase 2.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Aspartate aminotransferase 2.5 × ULN ; Creatinine 2.5 × ULN ; Bilirubin 2.0 × ULN ; Able understand provide sign informed consent ; Females childbearing potential must negative urine serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) pregnancy test screening . Exclusion Criteria Any clinically significant safety concern ( laboratory , electrocardiogram [ EKG ] , physical examination , ) , opinion Investigator , would place patient undue risk patient participate study ; Undergoing current treatment cancer ( radiation therapy , surgery chemotherapy ) Diabetic insulin dependence ( Patients know insulin dependence diabetes include study standard care protocol place clinical site provide management patient 's glucose level sufficiently allow PET/CT imaging perform . The glucose management use PET/CT image apply SPECT/CT image procedure . A waiver require complete clinical site approve sponsor designee ) ; Patient weight SPECT/CT PET/CT table weight limit ; Failure nonincisional biopsy definitive diagnosis ( cytology report bronchoscope ) NSCLC ( copy biopsy/cytology report must available investigator within 28 day Visit 1 ) ; Will agree use effective mean contraception duration study ( male female ) ; Known hypersensitivity ECDG FDG similar compound include inactive ingredient ; Known suspect pregnancy , lactation plan pregnancy ( female male partner ) ; Clinically significant mental illness ( determined Investigator ) ; Exposure investigational agent within 30 day prior screen visit participate ongoing clinical study ( criterion overrule Principal Investigator appropriate documentation reason exception ) ; Patient condition Investigator believe would interfere ability provide inform consent comply study instruction , might confound interpretation study result put patient undue risk .</criteria>
