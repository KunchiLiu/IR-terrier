	<brief_summary>The HIV integrase inhibitor , raltegravir ( RAL ) , recently approve FDA , show several trial highly effective . The main study estimate viral load decay rate treatment-naive HIV-infected participant receive RAL emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) . This substudy A5248 similarly examine characteristic decrease viral load focus estimate time first-phase viral decay start , follow initiation study drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensive Viral Dynamics Substudy A5248</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent data suggest early virologic response HIV intervention may predictive long-term virologic outcome . Defining early decay viral load carefully perform study viral dynamic may useful tool assess likely outcome long-term treatment . It may also useful screen tool define combination study . In main study , viral load decay rate estimate HIV-infected , treatment-naive participant receive RAL FTC/TDF . The A5248 study last approximately 72 week . All participant take RAL FTC/TDF 72 week . RAL provide study . FTC/TDF provide . A5248 consist 16 study visit . These visit occur study entry ; Days 2 , 7 , 10 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 56 , Weeks 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 , 72 . Blood collection pharmacokinetic study occur study visit . Self-reported adherence assessment submit visit . A targeted physical exam occur visit . Liver function test urine collection occur select visit . Pregnancy test occur whenever pregnancy suspect . This substudy enroll 10 participant A5248 . It critical substudy participant take medication direct ensure accurate trial result . Any participant discontinues study treatment also remove substudy replace . Participants ask medication hold adherence . No medication provide substudy . Study treatment provide administer per main study , A5248 . After participant begin study medication , sample collect substudy . Participants require stay overnight hospital Day 0 Day 2 . The morning study medication dose administer clinic Days , 2 , 3 , 4 , 7 . Medication diary provide participant Day 2 . Participants instruct record time take study medication Day 7 study . Participants require bring diary study visit Days 3 , 4 , 7 review . Participants may discontinue enrollment substudy still remain main study , A5248 . Participants may discontinue involvement A5248 remain substudy .</detailed_description>
