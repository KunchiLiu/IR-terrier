	<brief_title>Characterization Receptors Non-functioning Pituitary Macroadenomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pituitary gland brain master hormonal gland surround important nerve blood vessel . The pituitary gland develop various type tumor , produce hormone call non-functioning pituitary adenoma . These non-functioning tumor grow cause compression important structure . The usual treatment large non-functioning pituitary macroadenoma surgery . As surrounded neuro-vascular bundle , make complete removal tumor sometimes impossible even dangerous . A large number subject still residual tumor post-surgery . The risk residual tumor growth compression compromise function surround vital organ especially vision . If growth tumor option present repeat surgery radiotherapy . Repeat surgery involve risk associate brain surgery sometimes may possible close vital organ , radiotherapy period time lead complete partial deficiency pituitary hormone function associate long term cognitive deficit . In addition radiotherapy lag time 12-24 month prior onset action . However , pituitary tumor actively secrete hormone may still harbour receptor various hormone . The blockage receptor various medication may enable u stop tumor grow recur surgery . This may open novel mean treatment non function tumor . So far little information literature type receptor present tumor . Our study propose obtain piece tissue remove surgery perform receptor characterization help improve knowledge area . Also correlate receptor status clinical , hormonal radiological profile patient may help develop improved treatment strategy future help u predict possibility tumor regrowth .</detailed_description>
