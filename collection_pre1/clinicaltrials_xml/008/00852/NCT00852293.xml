	<detailed_description>Chitin poly saccharide , abundant insect , fungi , crustacean organisms , mammal . Chitinases chitinase like protein ( ability bind chitin without enzymatic activity ) member 18-glycosyl-hydrolase family . Their function importance still clearly understood . However , several report link chitinase 3 like 1 protein colitis asthma . Furthermore , Johansen et al report elevated level chitinase 3 like 1 protein patient liver disease , mainly alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) fibrosis . This report consist 51 patient ALD , 16 17 patient fatty liver viral hepatitis respectively . This study aim evaluate correlation chitinase 3 like 1 protein clinical parameter disease severity , reaction treatment , portal hypertension ( measure ) prognosis . ***Study design : . Subjects i.The study include patient liver disease follow liver unit , Hadassah Medical Center , Jerusalem . b . Planned number i.The study plan include 200 volunteer . c. Inclusion criterion i.Patients liver disease follow liver unit Hadassah Medical Center . ii.Patients give informed consent participation study . d. Exclusion criterion i.Age &lt; 18y . ii.Pregnancy iii.Patients condition associate elevated chitinase 3 like 1 protein ( asthma rheumatoid arthritis ) . e. Chitinase 3 like-1 protein level measure commercially available kit ( Human Chitinase 3-like 1 Quantikine ELISA Kit , catalogue number - DC3L1 , Biotest LTD ) . f. Stopping/modifying criterion i.At subject ' request . g. Trial entry enrollment i.A consecutive cohort recruit form amongst patient follow liver unit Hadassah medical center . Jerusalem Israel . ii.Consenting patient blood test drawn chitinase 3 like 1 protein level . iii.Clinical detail patient obtain form liver unit . iv.In addition routine follow liver unit , follow perform 1,2 5 year . h. Statistical consideration i.Subjects group accord clinical property ( disease , treatment , severity , portal hypertension ) ii.Chitinase 3 like 1 protein level compare group . F. Informed consent i.Each subject enrol enter study give informed consent . G. Adherence study eligibility i.The study conduct accordance good clinical practice ( GCP ) guideline , study protocol . H. Safeguarding document i.The privacy subject confidentiality issue handle accordance applicable law guideline institution Helsinki Committee , Israeli ministry health , appropriate regulatory authority .</detailed_description>
