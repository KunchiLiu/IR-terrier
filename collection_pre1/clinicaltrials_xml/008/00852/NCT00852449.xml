	<brief_summary>Postoperative organ dysfunction severely affect prognosis surgical patient . Despite several trial evaluate restrictive liberal fluid strategy , ideal fluid replacement strategy remain controversial . Owing risk alter tissue perfusion , key trigger organ dysfunction , purpose study compare influence restrictive liberal fluid regimen , use goal-directed approach , hypovolemia postoperative organ dysfunction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite several trial evaluate restrictive liberal fluid strategy , ideal fluid replacement strategy remain unanswered . Although recent study suggest intraoperative fluid restriction may reduce postoperative morbidity promote faster recovery , extrapolation individual patient remain difficult . Indeed , whether fluid overload may expose tissue oedema , impair oxygenation wound healing , fluid restriction may , conversely , expose hypovolemia , occur frequently abdominal surgery , lead tissue hypoperfusion organ dysfunction . To date , restrictive liberal fluid substitution strategy compare use goal-directed approach . In addition , recent data suggest target early indicator hypoperfusion , central venous oxygen saturation ( ScvO2 ) , reflect oxygen delivery/consumption relationship , may important management patient undergo major surgery . No data available effect intraoperative fluid volume replacement strategy ScvO2 modification . The purpose study first evaluate influence restrictive liberal fluid replacement strategy hypovolemia postoperative organ dysfunction use oesophageal doppler goal-directed approach ( goal = peak aortic velocity variation stroke volume optimization ) major abdominal surgery . The second objective investigate effect fluid load ScvO2 modification .</detailed_description>
