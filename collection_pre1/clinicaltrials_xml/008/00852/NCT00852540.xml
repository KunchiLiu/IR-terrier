	<brief_summary>The purpose study provide evidence clinical bacteriological efficacy retapamulin treatment subject SITL impetigo due MRSA . Subjects age 2 month old treat either topical retapamulin 5 day oral linezolid 10 day . The primary endpoint clinical response follow-up ( 7-9 day end therapy ) subject MRSA infection baseline . The primary population per-protocol MRSA population . It anticipate approximately 500 subject may enrol order obtain approximately 105 subject baseline MRSA infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double-blind , double dummy , multicenter , comparative study subject 2 month age old SITL ( include secondarily-infected laceration , suture wound abrasion ) impetigo ( bullous non-bullous ) due MRSA . A laceration suture wound exceed 10 cm length surround erythema extend 2 cm edge lesion . Abrasions exceed 100 cm2 total area , maximum 2 % total body surface area subject &lt; 18 year age , surround erythema extend 2 cm edge abrasion . Subjects impetigo 10 lesion infect lesion ( ) must 100 cm2 area ( maximum 2 % total body surface area subject &lt; 18 year age ) , must require surgical intervention must able appropriately treated topical antibiotic . There five study visit occur 17-19 day period . At baseline visit ( Visit 1 , day 1 ) , subject randomize receive retapamulin ( plus oral placebo ) linezolid ( plus placebo ointment ) 2:1 ratio . Retapamulin apply twice daily 5 day , linezolid dose , depend subject age , either twice three time daily 10 day . The on-therapy , end therapy follow-up visit stagger due difference duration treatment regimen . Subjects monitor clinically evaluate postbaseline visit . Randomization center-based stratify age ( &lt; 5 year , ≥5 &lt; 12 year , ≥12 year ) , perform use appropriate Interactive Voice Response System ( IVRS ) , automate telephone system . The block size remain confidential . Subjects consider complete study meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , consider compliant study medication , attend study visit define protocol .</detailed_description>
