The study screen household within select area 105 location ( primarily county ) . The major type analysis NCS data include longitudinal exposure-outcome analysis , identification causal pathway , analysis neighborhood effect , evaluation temporal effect within longitudinal data analysis data case-control data , analysis genomic data . Women first trim pregnancy invite participate pre-pregnancy portion NCS . Women pregnant high probability become pregnant ask participate early pregnancy portion NCS . All eligible woman ask study contact periodically assess pregnancy status . They also ask contact NCS become pregnant . Women identify pregnant within 4 year initial screening invite enroll NCS .
