	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect 2 commonly use diet , Mediterranean monounsaturated fatty acid enrich ( MUFA ) AHA polyunsaturated ( PUFA ) enrich diet combined VA Managing Overweight/Obesity Veterans Everywhere ( MOVE ! ) program determine one superior reduce cardiometabolic risk factor associate Metabolic Syndrome . The risk factor consider include lipid lipoprotein , inflammatory marker CRP adiponectin , endothelium-dependent flow-mediated vasodilatation ( FMD ) postprandial lipid response meal . Cardiometabolic risk factor determine measure several cardiovascular risk associate parameter include : Biochemical measurement lipid inflammatory marker , body composition VO2max ( Specific Objective 1 , Descriptive ) . Postprandial response meal challenge endothelial vasoreactivity ( FMD ) assess BART ( Specific Objective 2 , Physiological ) . Determination effect postheparin lipase transfer protein activity , visceral adipose tissue ( VAT ) homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) ( Specific Objective 3 , Mechanistic )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Metabolic Syndrome ( MetS ) common problem among Veterans associate great likelihood cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . The Mediterranean diet popular diet show reduce CVD event rate extent monounsaturated fatty acid ( MUFA ) polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) enrichment result improvement parameter MetS unresolved . Similarly , low intensity exercise improve CVD risk factor profile , comparative investigation compare MUFA PUFA enrich diet exercise patient MetS extend beyond 1 year . Recently , VA establish MOVE ! program , national weight management program design help Veterans lose weight . Using VA promoted program , perform systematic evaluation effect dietary fat composition [ comparison MUFA-enriched PUFA enrich diet ] MOVE ! . We hypothesize MUFA-enriched diet consist antioxidant , lipid reduce insulin sensitize property superior less palatable PUFA-enriched diet improve cardiometabolic parameter associate MetS . Specifically , MUFA MOVE ! program expect lead great improvement PUFA MOVE ! program body composition aerobic fitness ( Specific Aim 1 ) , endothelial dependent flow mediate vasodilatation postprandial lipid response meal load ( Specific Aim 2 ) mechanism ( lipolytic lipid transfer protein activity , homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance ) responsible effect ( Specific Aim 3 ) . Collectively , study advance understanding mechanism underlie differential effect MUFA PUFA-enriched dietary regimen cardiometabolic health combine MOVE ! program , provide new useful information Veterans ( general public ) interest optimize diet CVD disease prevention improve vascular health .</detailed_description>
