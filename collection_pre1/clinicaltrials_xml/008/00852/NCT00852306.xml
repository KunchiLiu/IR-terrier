	<brief_title>A Comparison Two Freezing Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human egg freeze rapidly become vital tool Assisted Reproductive Technology . Candidates egg freeze include woman without partner wish preserve fertility ; cancer patient risk lose fertility chemotherapy ; donor egg recipient . While past , egg freeze successful embryo freeze produce live birth , recent experience several center demonstrate significant improvement , pregnancy rate comparable achieve frozen embryo . The purpose study determine best method freeze egg . We shall seek volunteer egg donor program , since young , fertile donor represent best model study effect egg freeze . We plan enroll 12 recipient 6 donor study . Each egg donor go stringent screening process ( medical , genetic psychological ) . Eggs retrieve donor split half : one half frozen slow freeze method , half vitrification . Each six donor pair two recipient ; recipient assign half total eggs frozen . For recipient , half egg come slow freeze group half come vitrification . When recipient 's uterine lining deem ready ( follow estrogen treatment ultrasound monitoring ) , thaw perform egg freeze either slow freeze vitrification method . The thaw process randomize two type freeze . One sperm inject egg survive freeze . Fertilization embryo development record . Ideally , two embryo transfer recipient 's uterus . Pregnancy determine blood test follow serial blood test ultrasound . The study determine freeze method yield well survival pregnancy rate .</detailed_description>
