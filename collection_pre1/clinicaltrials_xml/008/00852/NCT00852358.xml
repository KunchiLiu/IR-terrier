	<brief_summary>This 24-month study use laronidase administer spinal fluid treat cognitive decline mucopolysaccharidosis I ( MPS I ) . MPS I rare genetic condition due deficiency enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase . Laronidase manufacture form enzyme alpha-l-iduronidase . MPS I heterogeneous disease several clinical phenotype range severe , Hurler syndrome , attenuate form , Hurler-Scheie Scheie . Although patient milder form MPS I may grossly observable problem cognition , patient learn difficulty apparent school neuropsychological testing . The goal study evaluate whether intrathecal recombinant human alpha-l-iduronidase ( rhIDU ) injection stabilize improve cognitive decline individual MPS I .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Intrathecal Enzyme Therapy Cognitive Decline MPS I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 24-month open label , prospective , randomized trial 16 MPS I patient age six year older document evidence cognitive decline . The study test safety efficacy intrathecal recombinant human alpha-L iduronidase ( rhIDU ) reduce stabilize cognitive decline assess subject baseline neuropsychological , clinical , radiological , biochemical evaluation monitor change parameter regimen first monthly , quarterly , intrathecal treatment rhIDU . The clinical safety regimen assess monitor adverse event , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) laboratory assessment , clinical evaluation . Subjects randomized treatment control group 12 month , follow subject receive 12 month active treatment . During first 12 month , control group receive similar study assessment unblinded placebo administer . Subjects extensive baseline screen evaluation , subject randomize treatment group receive first dose intrathecal rhIDU . The enzyme administer via intrathecal injection 1-3 month interval throughout 24-month study period . There mid-study analysis 12 month compare change IQ memory test control treatment group . If pre-established criterion improvement meet , study terminate 12 month point . If show effective , intrathecal enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) would treatment cognitive decline patient qualify and/or unable hematopoietic stem cell transplantation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The presence MPS I disease document low αLiduronidase activity Age six year old . The presence acquire cognitive deficit demonstrate : 1 . A score one standard deviation mean IQ test one domain neuropsychological function ( language , memory , nonverbal ability ) , OR 2 . Documented historical evidence decline great one standard deviation sequential testing , OR 3 . A score 0.75 1 standard deviation mean , AND cognitive deficit affect daily performance . The decline function explainable neurological psychiatric factor . Subject and/or guardian willing able provide write informed consent . Negative urine pregnancy test screening ( nonsterile female childbearing potential ) Currently use two acceptable method birth control determine investigator willing continue use acceptable birth control participation study ( nonsterile female childbearing potential sexually active ) Willing able comply study procedure . For example , subject must able complete write computerbased testing . The subject must able lie still MRI scanner least 40 minute without sedation . The subject undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation Recent initiation intravenous Aldurazyme® therapy le 6 month therapy . Subjects receive Aldurazyme® therapy 6 month , never receive Aldurazyme® therapy , allow enroll Pregnant lactating , consider pregnancy Receipt investigational drug procedure within 30 day enrollment A condition , medical , prevents participation study , include severe auditory visual impairment , significant lumbar pathology , lumbar catheter , recent major surgery within 6 week would preclude ability participate . Infusion reaction intravenous Aldurazyme® therapy require ongoing medical intervention , special prophylaxis alter rate dose enzyme administration The subject programmable VP shunt incompatible 3 Tesla MRI magnet unable unwilling undergo shunt revision MRI compatible device . The subject another contraindication MRI , nonremovable metal body . The subject severely impaired spinal CSF flow , demonstrated failure appearance 99mTechnetiumDTPA basal cisterns 4 hour intralumbar administration .</criteria>
