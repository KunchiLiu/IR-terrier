	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers study cause fatigue treatment various disease , result conclusive . - More information physical change affect body treatment may help identify biological chemical factor contribute patient fatigue , may allow physician identify individual may risk feel fatigue , , treatment disease cancer . Objectives : - To identify factor contribute fatigue men undergo radiation treatment prostate cancer . Eligibility : - Men 18 year age old schedule receive localize radiation treatment prostate cancer . Design : - Six outpatient visit NIH Clinical Center , approximately day time day : - First visit begin radiation treatment . - Once week first 2 week treatment , midpoint treatment , end treatment . - Final visit 4 week completion radiation treatment . - Initial visit involve physical examination question medical history . - Evaluations treatment period : - Blood draw identify cell chemical associate inflammation fatigue . - Questions physical activity , fatigue , depression , quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular-Genetic Correlates Fatigue Cancer Patients Receiving Localized External Beam Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although underlying mechanism fatigue study several disease condition data conclusive , symptom remain poorly manage present . Longitudinal study relate treatment-related fatigue prostate cancer patient conduct , limited study explore change physiologic mechanism radiotherapy identify individual risk endure fatigue therapy . Fatigue conceptualize multidimensional symptom incorporate temporal , sensory , cognitive/mental , affective/emotional , behavioral , physiological dimensions.This prospective , observational study first study explore molecular-genetic mechanism underlie fatigue cluster symptom ( urinary , sexual , gastrointestinal , psychiatric ) experience prostate cancer patient undergoing External Beam Radiation Therapy ( EBRT ) . The primary objective study describe change self-reported fatigue ; urinary , sexual , gastrointestinal symptom ; depression ; fatigue catastrophizing ; health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) experience patient without prostate surgery , , EBRT completion . The secondary objective study investigate pro-inflammatory cytokine profile EBRT-related fatigue ( TNF , IGF-I , IL-6 , IL-8 , TGF ( SqrRoot ) ) determine change white blood cell gene expression use buffy coat collection determine level oxidative stress change potential biomarkers influence oxidative stress blood buccal sample , , EBRT completion relate change level biological marker self-reported fatigue ; urinary , sexual , gastrointestinal symptom ; depression ; fatigue catastrophizing ; HRQOL score . This study also aim measure skeletal muscle strength , activity/fitness level , cognitive function energy expenditure patient , , completion EBRT , least 6 month post EBRT relate finding self-reported fatigue , physical symptom ( e.g . urinary , gastrointestinal , sexual functioning ) , depression , HRQOL score exercise training program . The study also aim describe change chemical profile brain associate change fatigue symptom use magnetic resonance spectroscopy EBRT .</detailed_description>
