The recommendation World Health Organization use artemisinin combination therapy ( ACT ) 2nd 3rd trimester already implement several African country , however documentation efficacy safety pregnancy still limit . Thus , investigator propose evaluate efficacy safety 4 ACT ( artemether-lumefantrine , amodiaquine-artesunate , mefloquine-artesunate dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ) , use treat pregnant woman P. falciparum malaria ; result help recommend optimal therapy high-risk group Africa .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malaria important human parasitic disease . Although pregnant woman high-risk group , almost systematically excluded clinical trial , fear teratogenicity embryotoxicity ; thus , generally lack sufficient information safety efficacy antimalarial pregnancy , well evidence-based recommendation prevention treatment malaria pregnancy . The WHO recommendation use artemisinin combination therapy ( ACT ) 2nd 3rd trimester already implement several African country . However , documentation efficacy safety pregnancy still limit , especially concern African context . Therefore , propose test 4 fixed-dose combination ( artemether-lumefantrine , amodiaquine-artesunate , mefloquine-artesunate dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ) , evaluate efficacy safety administer pregnant woman ( 2nd 3rd trimester ) infect P. falciparum . Explanatory variable collect treatment failure ( PCR-corrected ) recurrent parasitaemia . The primary hypothesis test clinical equivalence ( pair-wise non-inferiority ) 4 treatment regimen clinical equivalence define difference treatment failure rate ( PCR correct ) 5 % less . In addition , attempt do carry vitro test time recurrent infection . However , success test depend parasite density . In addition , blood sample collect filter paper day 0 day recurrent parasitaemia genotyped search know molecular marker relate drug resistance . Not sample analyze ; rather select accord therapeutic response prevalence molecular marker compare treatment success , true treatment failures new infection .</detailed_description>
