	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Dietary supplement , phytochemical , may stop delay development breast cancer . It yet know whether give docetaxel together phytochemical effective give docetaxel alone treat patient breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give docetaxel together phytochemical work compare give docetaxel alone first- second-line therapy treat patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel With Without Phytochemical Treating Patients With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare response rate HER2-negative patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer locoregional breast cancer recurrence treat docetaxel dietary phytochemical v docetaxel alone . Secondary - To compare overall clinical benefit rate ( i.e. , objective response plus stable disease ) patient treat regimen . - To compare time progression patient treat regimen . - To compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - To assess biomarkers response blood sample patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord recruitment center line chemotherapy ( first v second line docetaxel ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive docetaxel arm I . Patients also receive oral dietary phytochemical twice day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
