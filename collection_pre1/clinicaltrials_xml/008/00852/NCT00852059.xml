In subsequent control clinical trial 50 % participant randomize extended release ( ER ) methylphenidate ( Medikinet retard® ) apply breakfast , 50 % randomize immediate release ( IR ) methylphenidate ( Medikinet® ) morning 3-4 h later ( clinical trial ) . To optimize ecological validity , double-dummy technique apply ; allocation either study arm non-blinded . According power calculation 106 patient randomize . The total duration study 18 month . Starting run-in visit , eligible patient observe naturalistic run-in phase four week . Subsequently , patient participate 100 day clinical trial start baseline visit , between-visit final visit . Medical care provide routine program study centre . To record adherence , medication event count Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS ) .</detailed_description>
