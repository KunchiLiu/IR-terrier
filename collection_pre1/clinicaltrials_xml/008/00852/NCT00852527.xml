	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study determine clinical validity reliability VA 's Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) Clinical Reminder Screen Comprehensive TBI Evaluation use screen mild traumatic brain injury . Examining reliability two screen determine whether dependable . Verifying clinical validity important valid screening evaluation mild TBI lead accurate diagnosis timely treatment . Accurate screening also improve clinical efficiency ensure resource provide need . The project finding expect advance science screen diagnosis mild TBI event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Anticipated Impacts Veterans ' Healthcare : Determining clinical validity VA 's TBI Clinical Reminder Screen Comprehensive TBI Evaluation critical valid screen evaluation mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) lead accurate diagnosis timely treatment . Accurate screen improves clinical efficiency ensure resource provide need . The project finding expect advance science screen diagnosis clarify whether symptoms consistent post-concussion syndrome due mTBI event . Findings also expect inform development next generation VA screen instrument mild TBI . B . Project Background/Rationale : Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) lead injury among military personnel serve Operation Enduring Freedom/ Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OEF/OIF ) combat theater due largely improvised explosive device . While TBI severity range mild severe , mTBI particularly difficult identify , diagnose treat . The VA modify version Defense Veterans Brain Injury Center ( DVBIC ) tool , use screen return OEF/OIF service member . The VA 's modified screen , TBI Clinical Reminder Screen , use screen slightly different population . Therefore , result validity study DVBIC tool directly applicable . As result , General Accountability Office ( GAO ) recommend VA expeditiously evaluate clinical validity reliability TBI screen tool . C. Primary Study Objectives : ( 1 ) Develop Diagnostic Assessment Battery use proxy gold standard , ( 2 ) Evaluate compare performance characteristic TBI Clinical Reminder Screen Comprehensive TBI Evaluation use Diagnostic Assessment Battery . These objective realize via : ( ) An examination performance characteristic ( diagnostic validity ) TBI Clinical Reminder Screen Comprehensive TBI Evaluation relative Diagnostic Assessment Battery determine sensitivity specificity , ( b ) Determining whether false positive and/or false negative relate Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) performance characteristic test differ PTSD , ( c ) Ascertaining concordance among measure functional impairment , TBI Clinical Reminder Screen Comprehensive TBI Evaluation , ( ) Establishing concurrent validity diagnosis presence absence post-concussion syndrome due mTBI measure functional impairment , ( e ) Verifying test/retest reliability TBI Clinical Reminder Screen Comprehensive TBI Evaluation ( f ) Identifying whether cluster symptom subject report similar pattern symptom correspond clinical sub-groups ( e.g. , mTBI PTSD , PTSD alone ) . D. Project Methods : An online Delphi process conduct mTBI expert inform development Diagnostic Assessment Battery . A sample 500 OEF/OIF veteran recruit 12-months three VA Polytrauma Network Sites . The OEF/OIF veteran symptoms consistent either mild TBI event ( True Positive ) symptoms inconsistent event ( True Negative ) . All subject assess research clinician use TBI Clinical Reminder Screen , Comprehensive TBI Evaluation Diagnostic Assessment Battery . Analysis determine sensitivity specificity well test/retest reliability TBI Clinical Reminder Comprehensive TBI Evaluation . The performance characteristic Diagnostic Assessment Battery ascertain use understand best distinguish mTBI symptom relate and/or comorbid condition ( e.g. , PTSD , anxiety , depression ) .</detailed_description>
