	<brief_summary>This study investigate use patient immune cell treat prostate cancer . Cells take patient grown laboratory become specialized immune cell call dendritic cell . Dendritic cell instruct immune cell recognize attack foreign substance bacteria , virus , abnormal protein cancer cell . A protein call Tn-MUC-1 add cells.This protein present prostate cancer cell . The modified cell inject back patient , intention dendritic cell instruct immune cell attack prostate cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients undergo one standard apheresis harvest peripheral mononuclear cell dendritic cell vaccine preparation . The modified cell ( vaccine ) freeze multiple injection may give . Patients receive 5 injection . The vaccine give either intradermally lymph node . Patients undergo blood sample collection immune response study day treatment 2 week follow treatment .</detailed_description>
