	<brief_summary>Removal large bile duct stone technically challenge ERCP . Particularly , size stone 1.2cm remove use metal basket ( lithotripsy ) . This sometimes technically challenging may require one ERCP session . Recently , balloon use enlarge open bile duct ( sphincteroplasty ) help easy removal stone one ERCP session . There study compare lithotripsy sphincteroplasty technique . This randomized trial design address question technique superior bile duct stone extraction : lithotripsy versus sphincteroplasty .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Comparing Sphincteroplasty Lithotripsy Extraction Large Bile Duct Stones</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stones bile duct result various complication include acute cholangitis , acute pancreatitis secondary biliary cirrhosis.1 Bile duct stone therefore remove successfully achieve 85-90 % patient use standard endoscopic technique . This comprise endoscopic sphincterotomy whereby duodenal sphincter entrance bile duct cut endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) subsequent removal stone achieve use standard accessory basket and/or extraction balloon.2 However , large ( â‰¥ 15mm size ) multiple stone locate non-dilated bile duct difficult remove endoscopic sphincterotomy use standard accessories.2 In case , mechanical lithotripsy perform stone fragmentation prior removal . This involve use basket sheath wrap around stone , turn attach handle turn result stone fragmentation.1,2 Although show effective 84-98 % patient large stone , method cumbersome time-consuming.2 Endoscopic Balloon sphincteroplasty ( EBS ) [ ( Hurricane RX Balloon Dilatation Catheter ; Boston Scientific Corp. , Natick , MA , USA ) CRE Wireguided Balloon Dilatation Catheter ; Boston Scientific Corp. , Natick , MA , USA ) ] alternative technique balloon use dilate papilla locate bile duct open 8-20mm ( depend size distal CBD ) perform endoscopic sphincterotomy . Following dilation , stone remove use basket and/or extraction balloon . This technique show effective clearing bile duct 89-95 % patient difficult bile stone initial endoscopic sphincterotomy unsuccessful.3 Furthermore , randomize trial compare endoscopic sphincterotomy alone versus EBS removal bile duct stone , use mechanical lithotripsy significantly low EBS group ( 28.8 % EBS vs. 46.2 % endoscopic sphincterotomy , p=0.028 ) , although overall stone clearance rate comparable two group ( 89 % ESBD vs. 88.5 % ES , p=0.279 ) .4 The SpyGlass Direct Visualization System ( Boston Scientific Corp. , Natick , MA , USA ) single-operator peroral cholangioscopy system ( POC ) allow direct visualization bile duct stone.2 The main advantage technique probe insert endoscope guide bile duct reach stone . Using probe , energy laser ( laser lithotripsy ) accurately focus onto stone cause stone fragmentation direct visualization.1 The use SpyGlass system laser lithotripsy show successful clearance difficult bile duct stone 73-100 % patients.4-9 Although various method removal bile duct stone exist , thus far study directly compare EBS cholangioscopy-guided laser lithotripsy clearance bile duct stone . The aim study therefore compare efficiency single-operator peroral cholangioscopy-directed laser lithotripsy ( POC-LL ) use SpyGlass Direct Visualization system versus EBS clearance difficult bile duct stone .</detailed_description>
