Hierarchical multiple regression analysis examine hypothesize individual situational moderator intervention efficacy ( Specific Aim 3 ) . The use factorial design explicit mediational analysis allow strong inference regard `` active ingredient '' intervention efficacy . The long-term objective research improve efficacy early intervention inform research theory etiology alcoholism . More effective intervention , particularly target student developmental transition enhance risk , result few injury acute intoxication , enhance retention learning , lessen development alcoholism result chronic alcohol abuse .</detailed_description>
