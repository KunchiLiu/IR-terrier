	<brief_summary>Background : - Mast cell responsible symptom allergic reaction . In allergic disease , unusually easy cause mast cell release content cause allergic reaction . In case , mast cell grow abnormally , rare case , result tumor . Mast cell also control part immune system . - Understanding mast cell behave abnormally allergic disease important find good way diagnose treat potentially life-threatening disorder . Objectives : - To screen mast cell genetic functional level characterize abnormality , identify mutation , detect carrier state , and/or develop therapy disorder . - To create library information inherit disease mast cell homeostasis activation , include piebaldism ( problem skin hair pigmentation ) , anaphylaxis ( severe allergic reaction ) , allergy , asthma , atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) , allergic rhinitis ( hay fever ) , food allergy , urticaria/angioedema ( hives/swelling ) , immunodeficiency disease , autoimmune disease . Eligibility : - Patients age 1 80 year refer physician know suspect inherited disorder mast cell , particular patient ( relative ) piebaldism , allergy , anaphylaxis cause allergy . Design : - Study population consist 1000 participant 5-year period . One third study population consist patient ; two third consist biological relative . - Evaluation limit test blood specimen ; treatment provide . - Clinical research laboratory evaluation patient include follow : - Clinical evaluation previous laboratory test document outside medical record health care provider . A standard questionnaire also administer time subject enrollment . - Blood collection clinical laboratory testing , tailor subject clinical evaluation appropriate ( 5 ml ) . - Blood collection research laboratory testing , tailor subject clinical evaluation include genetic screening assessment mast cell growth function storage additional frozen blood specimen future study ( additional 30 ml ) . - Evaluations blood relative include follow : - Clinical evaluation document outside medical record health care provider administration standard questionnaire . - Blood collection indicate diagnostic research purpose . - After 12 consecutive month study , result initial evaluation review . Subjects finding deem continued interest contact invite remain active participant protocol another year , provide renew consent participate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Screening Protocol Genetic Diseases Mast Cell Homeostasis Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol design screen subject ( family member ) suspect identified genetic disease allergic inflammation mast cell homeostasis activation . Patients determine clinical history initial outside evaluation refer physician interest consent enrol study . Blood specimen store blood product derivative , saliva , hair , finger nail clipping , cord blood , umbilical cord , and/or buccal swab patient and/or family member obtain research study relate understanding genetic biochemical base disease . Outside medical record may obtain chart review correlate clinical history research laboratory test result . Results relay refer physician , applicable , patient refer appropriate National Institutes Health protocols additional clinical evaluation treatment . The study enroll 1000 subject family member .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects , age birth 999 year old , know suspect inherited disorder allergic inflammation mast cell homeostasis activation , eligible enrollment . Because intensive time labor require research laboratory testing , subject enrol opinion investigator ( base discussion patient private physician ) high index suspicion genetic disease allergic inflammation . Blood relatives enrolled subject eligible enrollment . There discrimination age , gender , race , disability . Subjects must health care provider outside NIH . Subjects/guardians must willing able give inform consent . Subjects must agree blood store future study immune system and/or medical condition . Women include study , include lactating may pregnant . Children include study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The presence acquire abnormality immune system , cytotoxic chemotherapy malignancy , may ground possible exclusion , opinion investigator , presence disease process would interfere evaluation . Subjects history HIV evidence chronic Hepatitis B and/or C infection exclude .</criteria>
