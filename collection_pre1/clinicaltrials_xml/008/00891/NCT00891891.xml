	<detailed_description>This study represent critical next step developmentally-oriented program research psychosocial adjustment adolescent spina bifida . Previously , conduct 10-year longitudinal study family relationship adjustment child find early family relationship variables highly salient prediction subsequent trajectory adjustment . Moreover , adolescent spina bifida find exhibit psychosocial adjustment difficulty , include significant social problem ( i.e. , social immaturity passivity , less social contact friend ) . This prior study between-groups investigation child spina bifida compare able-bodied comparison child first kind include assessment observe family interaction child spina bifida . To understand good underlie mechanisms account significant psychosocial difficulty , fund seek new within-group longitudinal study child spina bifida traverse early adolescent stage development . Unlike previous study , investigation include thorough assessment child 's peer relationship neuropsychological factor potential predictor variability psychosocial adjustment outcome . The propose study first collect observe peer interaction data ( target child close friend ) adolescents spina bifida . Moreover , examine degree neuropsychological limitation experience child spina bifida may contribute social difficulty . Thus , developmentally-oriented bio-neuropsychosocial model psychological adjustment evaluate young adolescent spina bifida ( see Figure 1 ) . Extensive multi-source multi-method data collect across several predictor variable domain : ( 1 ) biological ( i.e. , severity disability , current past health status , pubertal development ) , ( 2 ) neuropsychological ( i.e. , executive function attention , language pragmatic inference making skill , emotion recognition ) , ( 3 ) social ( i.e. , observed perceive social behavior peer family ) . A multidimensional perspective adolescent adjustment also adopt insofar follow construct assess : internalizing symptom ( e.g. , depression ) , externalize symptom ( e.g. , aggression ) , social adjustment , quality life functional status , school performance , autonomy development , medical adherence ( see Figure 1 ) . Participants include sample 140 child young adolescent spina bifida ( meningomyelocele [ MM ] shunt hydrocephalus ; 10-13 year old Time 1 12-15 year old Time 2 ) , along parent close friend . Spanish-speaking Hispanic/Latino family also recruit ( give high relative prevalence spina bifida population ) , constitute approximately 20 % sample . Teacher- health professional-reported data medical chart information also collect . Questionnaire , interview , neuropsychological testing , observational method employ two home visit Time 1 two home visit Time 2 . Videotapes family peer interaction cod trained graduate undergraduate student . In addition test utility bio-neuropsychosocial model , several mediational moderational model also test ( see Figures 2 3 ) within context general model Figure 1 . Such model facilitate identification underlie mechanisms association variable ( i.e. , mediational model ) attempt isolate variable within one domain compensate deficit another domain ( i.e. , moderational model ) . Findings study provide information differential relevance family relationship , peer relationship , neuropsychological factor , biological factor adjustment adolescent spina bifida . Moreover , result implication prevention intervention effort family offspring disable birth defect ( Dryfoos , 1990 ) .</detailed_description>
