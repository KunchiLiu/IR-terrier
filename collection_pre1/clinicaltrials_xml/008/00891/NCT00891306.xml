	<brief_summary>This trial design expand currently available data safety efficacy alipogene tiparvovec treatment lipoprotein lipase deficiency ( LPLD ) understand possible mechanisms action therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Human Lipoprotein Lipase ( LPL ) S447X Expressed Adeno-Associated Viral Vector LPL-deficient Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LPLD rare autosomal recessive disorder , characterize presence mark chylomicronemia hence hypertriglyceridemia . Clinically severe manifestation chylomicronemia , acute pancreatitis , lethal . There effective therapy available modulate course illness prevent complication patient . The current clinical management consist severe reduction dietary fat hard almost impossible comply . LPLD subject continue experience pancreatitis attack , admit intensive care unit several occasion . Alipogene tiparvovec corrects restore lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) function long term , hence revers symptom , halt disease progression prevents complication . Alipogene tiparvovec gene therapy ensure catabolically beneficial variant human LPL gene , LPL [ S447X ] express active relevant tissue human . Delivery gene realize via intramuscular injection adeno-associated viral vector , pseudotyped AAV1 capsid .</detailed_description>
