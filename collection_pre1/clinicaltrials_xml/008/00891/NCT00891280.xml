	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 study oral CX-4945 design test safety , tolerability high safe dose level CK2 inhibitor patient advance solid tumor cancer , Castleman 's Disease Multiple Myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-escalation Study Oral CX-4945</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated CK2 activity associate malignant transformation aggressive tumor growth overexpression CK2 document multiple type cancer . CK2 emerge potential anticancer target inhibition CK2 represent potential therapeutic strategy target specific molecular defect perpetuate many cancer . CX-4945 demonstrate potent inhibition CK2 enzymatic activity . This study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect CX-4945 administer patient malignancy lymphoproliferative disorder know overexpress CK2 include advance solid tumor , Multiple Myeloma Castleman 's Disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm malignancy lymphoproliferative disorder know express CK2 fail standard therapy ( surgery , radiotherapy , endocrine therapy , chemotherapy ) effective therapy available , include follow type : ( example ) Lung cancer Renal cell cancer Breast cancer Inflammatory breast cancer Head neck cancer squamous cell Prostate cancer Colorectal cancer Castleman 's disease ( multicentric disease ) Multiple myeloma ( Eligible patient must quantifiable Mprotein level present serum and/or urine ) At least 18 year age . One tumor measurable radiograph CT scan , evaluable disease define nonmeasurable lesion per RECIST detection protein M serum and/or urine patient Multiple Myeloma ( serum ≥ 10 gm/L urine ≥ 200 mg/24 hr ) . Laboratory data specify : Hematology : ANC &gt; 1500 cells/mm3 , platelet count &gt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Hemoglobin &gt; 9 gm/L Hepatic : bilirubin &lt; 1.5 X ULN ; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 2.5 X ULN . Patients know liver metastasis liver neoplasm : alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; 5.0 X ULN Renal : serum creatinine within normal limit ( WNL ) , define within 10 % institution 's state reference range , calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient abnormal , increase , creatinine level . Patients Multiple Myeloma ( ) : serum creatinine ≤ 2.5 institutional upper limit normal range calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Coagulation : INR &lt; 1.5 time normal , aPTT &lt; 1.5 time normal . Patients receive therapeutic dos anticoagulant therapy may consider eligible trial INR aPTT within acceptable therapeutic limit institution . A negative pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential ) . Estimated life expectancy least 3 month Karnofsky Performance Status ≥ 70 % For men woman childproducing potential , use effective contraceptive method study Ability understand requirement study , provide write informed consent . Pregnant nursing woman . Seizure disorder require anticonvulsant therapy . Known brain metastasis ( unless previously treat well controlled period &gt; = 3 month ) . Major surgery , diagnostic surgery , within 4 week prior first dose test drug . Treatment radiation therapy surgery within one month prior study entry Treatment chemotherapy investigational drug within 21 day prior screen visit . Acute toxicities prior therapy must resolve Grade ≤ 1 baseline . Patients history second malignancy within 3 year baseline visit exclude cutaneous carcinoma insitu carcinoma . Concurrent severe uncontrolled medical disease . Active symptomatic fungal , bacterial and/or viral infection include active HIV viral hepatitis . Difficulty swallow active malabsorption syndrome Chronic diarrhea Gastrointestinal disease include gastritis , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , hemorrhagic coloproctitis History gastric small bowel surgery involve extent gastric small bowel resection . Clinically significant bleeding event within last 3 month , unrelated trauma , underlying condition would expect result bleed diathesis Patients exhibit allergic reaction similar structural compound formulation component . Concomitant use warfarin HMGCoA reductase inhibitor ( statin )</criteria>
