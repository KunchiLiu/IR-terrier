	<brief_summary>The goal study determine best dose drug call oxytocin , usually use stop bleeding delivery , use cesarean delivery . It administer cesarean section order decrease amount blood loss . The investigator propose 3 group subject give different safe dose oxytocin ass effectiveness regimens amount blood lose cesarean sections.This let use know best low dose need .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxytocin Decrease Blood Loss During Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial randomize , blind control trial conduct American University Beirut Medical Center Labor Delivery Unit . Identification candidate : - All woman admit Delivery Suite elective cesarean delivery need cesarean delivery obstetric reason invite participate study . - Women approach research assistant and/or investigator explain objective study ask eligible woman participate trial sign consent form . Study subject randomize use computer-generated random number sequence stratify elective emergency cesarean section . At surgery , seal opaque envelope contain randomization number data sheet open consent patient . Interventions : Pre-mixed , oxytocin solution either 20U/500ml , 30U/500ml 40U/500ml Lactated Ringer 's solution available pharmacy department . The bags identical appearance . Each bag label study identification number , pharmacy could determine administer dose . Subjects well medical provider blind assignment solution use . Immediately delivery infant , study solution infuse 30 minute use continuous infusion pump ( 666 mU/min versus 999 mU/min versus 1332mU/min ) . The placenta deliver spontaneously gentle cord traction . In postanesthesia care unit , practice give patient mixture 30 U , 20 U 10U oxytocin run consecutively 1 L lactate Ringer 's solution rate 125 mL/h ( 41.7 mU/min ) , continue total 24 hour . Determination need additional uterotonic agent make obstetrician administer recorded anesthesiologist . At discretion surgical team , additional oxytocin could add study solution ( eg , 20 U ) request methylergonovine , 0.2 mg IM , 15-methyl prostaglandin F2a 250 mg IM . Intramuscular methylergonovine maleate , and/or carboprost tromethamine available operating room administer need . Ephedrine use treat hypotension delivery systolic blood pressure &gt; 25 mm Hg baseline . We compare mean difference preoperative hemoglobin vs. postoperative hemoglobin group . It refer delta Hemoglobin ( Î” Hb ) . In addition , assess several parameter include uterine tone , volume blood lose laparotomy pad number weight among data . We perform multiple comparison among 3 group specifically towards primary outcome change drop hemoglobin predelivery postdelivery level . The arm study low dose pitocin least amount blood loss would probably optimal dose need cesarean section patient satisfies inclusion criterion trial . In institution worldwide , protocol usually apply state much pitocin add 1 liter bag NS LR cesarean section . It often range 10 unit 40 unit depend surgeon preference uterine tone . The uterus exteriorized time surgery . The uterine tone play role choice dose id use ( low versus high dose ) , however optimal , efficient dose least amount side effect yet determine . We aim determine optimal dose prevent obstetrician additional use uterotonics ( methergine , prostaglandin ) carry unwanted side effect .</detailed_description>
