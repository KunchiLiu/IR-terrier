	<brief_title>The Role Of Cognitive Impairment In The Use Of The Diskus Inhaler</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Objectives : Approximately 1.6 million geriatric nursing home ( NH ) resident live 17,000 Nursing Homes United States . This population ( include live Assisted Living Facilities [ ALFs ] ) increase significantly next 20 year `` Baby Boomers '' enter age group . Associated increase number cognitively impaired individual Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . As nation , need find effective efficient mean care grow population . Sometimes `` intuitive anecdote '' ; belief mildly moderately cognitively impaired individual ( score 10 24 Mini Mental State Exam [ MMSE ] ) unable synthesize execute instruction necessary successful use Diskus Inhaler COPD . We propose controlled assessment DISKUS Inhaler use mildly moderately cognitively impaired resident live NHs ALFs . The Diskus Inhaler administer nurse medical technician NH setting . The administration medication Diskus Inhaler include 4 step : open , click , inhale , close . The step resident must `` inhale '' step , include hold one 's breath 10 second inhalation . We propose properly train motivate nurse medical technician successfully administer medication use Advair Diskus almost mildly moderately cognitively impaired resident follow instruction- `` inhale '' hold breath 10 second '' . The objective show mild moderate cognitive impairment barrier use Diskus Inhaler . Experimental Plan : 1 . Equipment Diskus Inhalers fill placebo provide GlaxoSmithKline . 2 . Subjects : - Total number subject 40 - Subjects 18 old select site St. Petersburg , FL Dayton , OH area - No compensation give subject participation - Subjects spend 15 -30 minute one visit - The Mini Mental Status Exam ( MMSE ) administer determine degree cognitive impairment - Subjects recruit investigator study coordinator ( SC ) visit NHs . No advertise do 3 . Duration : Data collection take 3 month additional 1 month data analysis period 4 . Investigational Plan : ( ) There Principal Investigator state - Dr Fraser Florida Dr Patel Ohio . Fraser also overall PI whole study . ( ii ) Initial potential subject draw 2 practice Dr Fraser Dr Patel part . Initial screen base informal chart review practice . ( iii ) Initial contact potential subject/Legally Appointed Representative ( LAR ) PI/SubI/SC . The subject see either Nursing Home ( Bethany Brooksville Health Care ) . ( iv ) If potential subject LAR , LAR contact first obtain informed consent study discuss NH resident . The reason want appear pressure LAR agree potential subject enrol . The reality live NH monotonous NH patient enjoy something different . The LAR tell patient ' enter study affect way ongoing physician patient relationship ( v ) If LAR agree allow patient enrol , study discuss patient , ask ca n't , tell eligible discus LAR . They NOT told LAR decline . ( vi ) There 2 consent form ( Form A ) ; one LAR another version use simple language ( Assent - Form B ) potential subject review sign . If LAR agree , fulfil step involve LAR Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) Process obtain write consent use Form A , study discuss potential subject assent request use Assent Form B . If want participate , enrol regard enrol either obtain assent completion Assent Form B OR document unable comprehend/sign Assent Form B ( vii ) It possible since NHs/ ( Closed Congregate Retirement Centers ) CCRCs close community , word get around NH resident , care physician , also want include . In case , PI/SubI/SC ask Nurses obtain write order attend physician , place patient 's chart study even discuss potential subject designate LAR . ( ) After order chart , chart review determine patient potential subject . Then stag ( iv ) thru ( vi ) follow . ( viii ) After inform consent obtain , PI/Sub I/SC meet subject review chart order confirm eligibility . 1 . The resident ask take deep breath hold PI/Sub I/SC count 10 . 2 . If subject able hold breath 10 second , subject give MMSE . 3 . If score MMSE fall 10 24 inclusively , subject instruct use Diskus Inhaler . 4 . The PI/Sub I/SC demonstrate open , click , inhale , close phase ask resident repeat action . 5 . The PI/Sub I/SC may repeat demonstration 2 time , ( total 3 demonstration ) necessary , resident complete 4 task successfully . 6 . The PI/SubI/SC allow 1-2 minute attempt resident showing sign shortness breath . The PI/Sub I/SC rate step Diskus Inhaler Evaluation Scale ( Appendix I ) . 7 . The rating end resident successfully complete 4 phase resident 3 unsuccessfully attempt , whichever come first . 8 . The rater complete global assessment use Diskus Inhaler , indicate overall whether subject adequately inadequately used Diskus Inhaler 9 . The subject tell complete study thank cooperation . They ask question question answer PI/SubI/SC leave room 10 . The unit charge nurse tell resident complete study thank ( xii ) The LARs/potential subject tell financial benefit either way study take maximum 30 min . They tell direct benefit type knowledge gain may help company design delivery mechanism cognitively impaired people , like subject , may benefit future . ( xii ) . There study requirement . e. Chronology Study : ( ) A total 40 subject study - 20 Florida 20 Ohio . If reason site either state unable enroll 20 , site state make deficiency . The following timeline anticipate receive IRB approval : Week 1-4 : Print form , team meeting phone 2 site review protocol ensure uniformity . Week 5-12 : Enroll subject perform study Week13-18 : Perform statistical analysis , prepare submit final report . ( ii ) Number visit . Screening/ Consent explain 1 Consent obtained/ Evaluation visit 1 There minimum 3 day 2 visit . f. Power Analysis : We determine sample size 2 group differ little 50 % . The estimated sample size two-sample comparison proportion : Test Ho : p1 = p2 , p1 proportion population 1 p2 proportion population 2 Assumptions : alpha = 0.0500 ( two-sided ) power = 0.9000 p1 = 1.0000 p2 = 0.5000 n2/n1 = 1.00 Estimated required sample size : n1 = 18 n2 = 18 We expect say examined difference Diskus use group could small 50 % confidence ( P &lt; .05 two-tail testing &amp; Power 0.90 ) . g. Safety Monitoring : Since intervention , safety monitoring . Adverse event ( AEs ) record . Serious adverse event ( SAEs ) capture PI Sub-I feel event relate study procedure . h. Confidentiality protection : All data identify resident 's initial 4 digit subject number . No name use . The data keep PI/Sub I/SC bring back NH research facility store locked area . No one study staff access data collect . All data collect paper ; electronic file use . Risk Analysis/Informed Consent : Since placebo inhale maximum 3 time , believe risk resident .</detailed_description>
