	<brief_summary>This study phase I study new cell base prostate cancer therapy ( ALECSAT ) . In therapy specific cell patient 's immune system isolate , activate re-administered patient boost specific immune response cancer cell . The aim study show safety tolerability type therapy .

	<brief_title>Safety Study Cytotoxic Lymphocytes ( CTL ) Based Prostate Cancer Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective open phase I study investigate safety tolerability administration single dose cell base medicinal product ( CBMP ) ALECSAT . ALECSAT autologous CBMP make patient 's blood cell . ALECSAT contain large amount tumour specific cytotoxic Lymphocytes ( CTL ) Natural Killer ( NK ) cell isolate activate amplified number . The CBMP give slow i. v. injection patient prostate cancer . The patient late stage disease receive hormone treatment disease progressing . The primary objective study observe side effect tolerability issue occur consequence cell administration , secondarily observe positive anti tumour effect may observe . The study purpose investigate whether treatment ALECSAT way toxic . Trial Design : The study open , prospective phase I safety study ALECSAT prostate cancer patient . A group consist 6 patient treat ALECSAT accord protocol . Then interim analysis do . If sign significant toxicity relate treatment , study continue 8 patient include treated ALECSAT accord phase I protocol . Thus study include total 14 patient . The patient single administration ALECSAT hospitalise 3 day furthermore follow closely 7 week 5 plan study visit , investigator Urologisk Klinik Fredrikssund Hospital .</detailed_description>
