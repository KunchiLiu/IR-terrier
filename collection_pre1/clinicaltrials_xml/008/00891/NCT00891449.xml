	<detailed_description>Flight Analogs/Bed Rest Research Project ( FA/BRRP ) provide NASA ground-based research platform complement space research . By mimic Earth condition weightlessness experience human body space , NASA test refine scientific theory procedure develop countermeasure protect human effect space travel . The use ground analog , bed rest , essential access resource require conduct study space limit , expense study significantly great conduct use flight analog . Future space exploration challenge NASA answer many critical question human live work extended mission away Earth . Flight analog test critical NASA validate countermeasure , give opportunity use flight platform Shuttle retire ; also , US 1-2 International Space Station ( ISS ) crewmembers per Expedition . The Flight Analogs/Bed Rest Research Project one way NASA devise way ensure astronaut safety productivity extend mission moon Mars . In Flight Analogs Project ( FAP ) , volunteer spend many day control research environment Flight Analog Research Unit ( FARU ) Galveston , TX . In current campaign , volunteer undergo three phase bedrest project : 1 ) pre-bedrest baseline testing , 2 ) bedrest phase , 3 ) recovery period . Bed rest result many physiologic change similar see astronaut . Pre bed rest use gather baseline data bed-rest phase data compare . Researchers monitor volunteer ' body change course study quickly recover allow resume normal activity . Post bed rest use monitor recovery bed rest . In long campaign , return unit follow-up testing may request 1 , 3 , 6 , and/or 12 month . THE COUNTERMEASURE AND FUNCTIONAL TESTING STUDY ( CFT ) test effectiveness exercise loss muscle , bone cardiovascular function . Participants perform exercise program system call standalone Zero Gravity Locomotion Simulator ( sZLS ) , `` vertical treadmill '' remove weight long axis body simulate exercise do space . Resistance ( weight lift ) exercise perform special weight machine . Before 70 day bedrest , participant test correspond set physiological measure . Specific exercise intensity rotate workout different , day heavier light . Results study help understand mission task might affect change physiology space flight design countermeasures prevent minimize impairment physiological system The ALTERNATE COMPRESSION GARMENT STUDY ( ACG ) determine effectiveness compression garment regulate blood pressure body system extend period head-down bed rest . Participants experimental group wear custom-fit compression garment undergo evaluation response upright tilt test corresponding set physiological measure 14 day bed rest . These participant compare another group participant wear compression garment . Results study help scientist determine time take cardiovascular system re-adapt upright posture , determine whether wear compression garment recovery necessary protect dizziness loss consciousness often experience space mission , determine effect wear custom fit compression garment amount time need readjust normal , upright posture .</detailed_description>
