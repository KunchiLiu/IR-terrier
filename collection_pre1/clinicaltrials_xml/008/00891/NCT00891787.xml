	<brief_summary>Background : - Probiotics oral food supplement contain live bacteria may beneficial person digestion general health . Probiotics available tablet , powder , liquid supplement frequently use supplement yogurt . They available purchase without prescription supermarket . - The bacteria probiotic supplement commonly express sugar substance surface . These sugar substance similar group A B blood group sugar , call antigen . These antigen determine person blood group . Researchers study effect probiotic supplement amount blood group antibodies present person blood . Objectives : - To determine whether take oral probiotic supplement increase anti-A anti-B isoagglutinin ( antibody cause red blood cell clump together ) healthy subject . - To study frequency effect determine whether dose-response relationship probiotic isoagglutinin titer . Eligibility : - Healthy adult , 18 year old , type A , B , O blood . - Female participant need undergone menopause hysterectomy . - Individuals ineligible currently donate platelet ; history ulcerative colitis Crohn disease ; major bowel surgery ; pregnant capable become pregnant ; bleed clot disorder ; history blood disorder immune deficiency ; history high-risk behavior exposure HIV hepatitis B C ; diabetes ; receive vaccination past 2 month , exception flu vaccine ; currently take immunosuppressive medication ; currently take antibiotic ; take probiotic supplement within last 12 month . Design : - Researchers conduct follow test throughout 28-week study : - Blood sample draw every 2 week measure quantity isoagglutinin titer . - Depending individual result , continue blood testing may do every 3 month 1 year , every 6 12 month 5 year . - Study subject take probiotic supplement dose 1 3 caplets per day 18 consecutive week accord follow schedule : - During first 6-week period , subject take one probiotic tablet daily . - During second 6-week period , subject take one probiotic tablet twice daily . - During third 6-week period , subject take one probiotic tablet three time daily . - Control group subject follow similar manner take probiotic supplement . - The outcome measure percent probiotic ingestors ( study subject ) versus control group subject experience fourfold great rise isoagglutinin titer . - Study subject receive follow financial compensation : $ 10 per blood sample , maximum $ 240 24 sample collect ; $ 100 complete first 6-week period ; $ 150 complete second 6-week period ; $ 200 complete third 6-week period . - Control subject receive $ 10 per blood sample , maximum $ 150 15 sample collect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Probiotics over-the-counter dietary supplement contain live bacteria . These bacteria normally present gastrointestinal tract may provide health benefit add regular diet . Common reason take probiotic supplement include repopulating gut lactobacillus take antibiotic aid treatment inflammatory bowel disease , lactose intolerance , gastrointestinal infection . The gut neonates sterile becomes colonize bacteria first month life . Many bacteria possess terminal sugar structure membrane component chemically similar A B blood group substances present red cell . Antibodies A B blood group substances present birth . Early life , infant lack A B antigen red cell recognize correspond antigen bacteria form antibodies bacterial sugar cross react correspond red cell antigen . These antibody know anti-A anti-B isoagglutinin . They cause disease , important transfusion compatible blood unit . Prior study suggest probiotic consume large dos may provoke formation high titer isoagglutinin . This relevance transfusion platelet component , , since ABO-matching platelet necessary , minor ABO-incompatibility donor recipient present 10-20 % plateletpheresis component transfuse nationwide . Plateletpheresis component derive donor take probiotic might contain high titer isoagglutinin , could cause hemolytic reaction group A B recipient . The objective study ( 1 ) determine whether take oral probiotic supplement increase anti-A anti-B isoagglutinin healthy subject , ( 2 ) study frequency effect determine whether dose-response relationship probiotic isoagglutinin titer . Study subject ask take probiotic supplement dose 1-3 caplets per day 18 week . Blood sample draw every 2 week time . Depending individual result , continue blood testing may do every 3 month year , every 6-12 month 5 year . A group control subject follow similar manner , take probiotic supplement . The outcome measure percent probiotic ingestors versus control experience four-fold great rise isoagglutinin titer association final titer least 128 .</detailed_description>
