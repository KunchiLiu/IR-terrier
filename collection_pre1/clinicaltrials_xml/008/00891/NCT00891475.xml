	<detailed_description>Nephrectomy become integral part management patient metastatic kidney cancer . Performing nephrectomy patient without risk , however . The real chance significant metastatic disease progression postoperative period complication surgery may prolong postoperative recovery could potentially delay prevent administration systemic therapy postoperative period . Patient selection surgery remain critical success . Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) medical procedure tumor ablate use microwave energy treat medical disorder . The benefit RFA select metastatic renal cell carcinoma patient small primary tumor ( &lt; 5 cm ) evaluate Phase I/II study .</detailed_description>
