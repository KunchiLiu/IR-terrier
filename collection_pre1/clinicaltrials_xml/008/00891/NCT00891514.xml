	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect treadmill train inflammation skeletal muscle adipose tissue , insulin action skeletal muscle , whole body glucose metabolism stroke survivor . The fundamental hypothesis study key inflammatory marker adipose tissue skeletal muscle abnormal , skeletal muscle insulin signal impaired , systemic insulin sensitivity reduce hemiparetic stroke patient factor modifiable improve exercise training stroke patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many stroke survivor sedentary risk development diabetes . We study interaction adipose tissue paretic non-paretic muscle inflammation , insulin signal action hemiparetic stroke patient ability employ exercise training reverse abnormality ethnically diverse population . Participants age 40-75 year chronic stroke randomize treadmill train versus stretch control group use one-two-one blocked randomization race ( black vs. white ) , sex ( male vs. female ) , glucose tolerance status ( normal vs. impaired type 2 diabetes ) . Stroke occur 780,000 person year U.S. , vast majority report person old 55 year age . Following stroke , patient remain continued high risk recurrent stroke . Inflammatory process lead cardiovascular events/stroke contribute disease risk progression impact insulin resistance development type 2 diabetes . Interventions reduce inflammation improve insulin sensitivity important clinical implication , especially stroke population . Task-oriented treadmill train utilized improve cardiovascular fitness functional mobility hemiparetic stroke patient . Additionally , preliminary data indicates progressive treadmill train population improve glucose tolerance .</detailed_description>
