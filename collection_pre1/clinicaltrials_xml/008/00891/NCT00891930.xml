	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate mechanism ( ) resistance anti-epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) antibody panitumumab give combination irinotecan metastatic colorectal carcinoma ( mCRC ) patient wild-type Kirsten rat sarcoma-2 virus oncogene ( KRAS ) tumor status time initial diagnosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Mechanisms Acquired Resistance Panitumumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part 1 , participant undergo baseline tumor biopsy receive panitumumab irinotecan . Participants respond stable disease continue receive treatment radiographically-confirmed disease progression . These participant undergo second tumor biopsy blood sample proceed Part 2 study . Participants radiographically confirm disease progression time first tumor measurement undergo blood sample proceed directly Part 2 . In Part 2 , participant receive panitumumab ganitumab . In part study , panitumumab irinotecan ( Part 1 ) panitumumab ganitumab ( Part 2 ) administer every 2 week disease progression , intolerability , withdrawal consent , death , unless otherwise indicate study team .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm metastatic adenocarcinoma colon rectum ; Subjects wildtype KRAS tumor status confirm Amgen approve central laboratory assessment experience local laboratory assessment archival tumor tissue ( preferably primary tumor ) ; Radiographic evidence disease progression ≤ 6 month completion treatment irinotecan oxaliplatin oxaliplatinbased chemotherapy mCRC ; Radiographic measurement tumor burden do within 28 day prior Day 1 ( start treatment investigational product ) ; At least 1 unidimensionally measurable lesion ≥ 20 mm use conventional compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan per modify RECIST v1.0 . Lesion must choose previously irradiate field , unless document disease progression field irradiation prior enrollment . All sit disease must evaluate ; At least 1 tumor ( preferably metastasis unresected primary tumour ) amenable core biopsy , determine clinician perform biopsy ; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 ; A life expectancy estimate ≥ 3 month ; Willing undergo two serial core biopsy procedure tumor ( metastasis unresected primary ) ; criterion may apply History primary cancer , unless : Malignancy treat curative intent know active disease present ≥ 3 year enrollment felt low risk recurrence treat physician , Adequately treat nonmelanomatous skin cancer lentigo maligna without evidence disease , Adequately treated cervical carcinoma situ without evidence disease , Prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia without evidence prostate cancer ; History prior concurrent central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases ; Prior treatment antiEGFR ( eg , panitumumab , cetuximab small molecule inhibitor ( eg , erlotinib , gefitinib ) ; Prior treatment monoclonal antibody direct insulinlike growth factor1 receptor ( IGF1R ) small molecule inhibitor direct IGF1R ; Use systemic chemotherapy radiotherapy ≤ 21 day enrollment . Subjects must recover acute toxicity relate radiotherapy ; Use antibody therapy ( eg , bevacizumab ) ≤ 42 day enrolment ; Use antitumor therapy include prior experimental agent approve antitumor small molecule ≤ 30 day enrolment ; Known allergy hypersensitivity component panitumumab , irinotecan , AMG 479 ; Known uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 ( UGT1A1 ) polymorphisms predispose increase irinotecan toxicity ; History irinotecan intolerance may interfere plan treatment ; History interstitial lung disease ( eg , pneumonitis , pulmonary fibrosis ) evidence interstitial lung disease baseline chest CT scan ; Clinically significant cardiovascular disease ( include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ) ≤ 1 year enrolment ; Active inflammatory bowel disease active bowel disease cause chronic diarrhea ( define ≥ grade 2 per Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 3.0 ) ; Known positive test ( ) human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , hepatitis C virus , acute chronic active hepatitis B infection ; Major surgical procedure ≤ 28 day enrollment minor surgical procedure ≤ 14 day enrollment . Subjects must recover surgery related toxicity . Core biopsy , central venous catheter placement , fine needle aspiration , thoracentesis , paracentesis consider major minor surgical procedure ; Other investigational procedure drug ( ie , participation another clinical study ) ≤ 30 day enrolment ; criterion may apply</criteria>
