	<brief_summary>Impaired hand function one frequently persist consequence stroke . The purpose study compare two different treatment -- Contralataterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation ( CCFES ) Cyclic Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( cNMES ) -- improved recovery hand function stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electrical Stimulation Recovery Hand Function Chronic Stroke Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemiparesis upper limb one serious common impairment result stroke . Approximately 75 % 750,000 stroke occur annually United States cause degree upper extremity paralysis . Approximately 65 % stroke survivor still use affected hand assist activity daily live 6 month stroke . The impact upper extremity impairment disability health great , yet relatively rehabilitation intervention design restore function impair upper limb . Therefore , long-term objective develop upper extremity rehabilitation therapy effective restore arm hand function , applicable across wide range impairment severity , readily implement present healthcare environment . The purpose study estimate efficacy Contralataterally Controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation ( CCFES ) reduce upper extremity impairment activity limitation chronic upper extremity hemiplegia . CCFES rehabilitation intervention neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) apply finger thumb extensor muscle paretic upper limb open hand . The stroke survivor control stimulation intensity , consequent degree hand opening , modulate degree open contralateral unimpaired hand , detect instrumented glove . Thus , volitional opening unaffected hand produce stimulate open affected hand . The stimulation paradigm use assist stroke survivor practice functional task affect hand . Pilot study CCFES chronic hemiplegia encouraging . This project expand work already begin : 1 ) determine 12 week CCFES therapeutically effective chronic stroke survivor , 2 ) determine plateau treatment effect achieve 12 week complete , 3 ) determine initial level motor impairment affect treatment efficacy , 4 ) determine whether therapeutic gain persist time . We conduct randomize controlled trial 102 chronic stroke survivor ( &gt; 6 month post-stroke ) randomly assign receive 12 week CCFES cyclic NMES , intervention provide electrical stimulation hand extensor , preprogrammed timing intensity . Randomization stratify two level baseline hand impairment define degree voluntary finger extension present . Assessments upper extremity impairment activity limitation make every 3 week treatment period every 2 month 6-month follow-up period . This study first randomize control trial CCFES chronic upper extremity hemiplegia . Ultimately , information learn study serve accelerate development treatment reduce post-stroke disability .</detailed_description>
