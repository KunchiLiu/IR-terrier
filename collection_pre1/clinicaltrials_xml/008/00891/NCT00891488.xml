	<detailed_description>Aging associate diminished stress resilience , reduce ability manage recover acute change homeostasis . Increased oxidative damage cell tissue dysregulation stress hormone link age-associated chronic disease include atherosclerosis , cancer , cardiovascular disease Alzheimer 's disease . Interventions improve body 's resistance stress , result lower oxidative stress well regulation stress hormone , may prevent delay onset age-related disease improve quality life . Oxidative stress believe key mechanism age process , free radical also implicate many pathological process . Similarly , dysregulation hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis think play role age link increased risk age-related chronic disease . The hormesis theory suggest certain amount stress lead well survival reduce tissue damage follow subsequent , severe stress . One way stress system acute exercise . Regular exercise training , however , result adaptive response increase tolerance successive ( exercise ) stress . A relevant question whether adaptation regular exercise training translate great resilience psychosocial stress increase capacity resist acute oxidative stress , thereby provide increase protection disease associate dysregulation system . This study investigate stress resilience two area related aging : oxidative stress neuroendocrine response psychosocial stress . The effect physical fitness oxidative stress compensation neuroendocrine stress reactivity determine compare fit unfit old men woman . The overall aim study provide enhance understanding mechanism physical fitness modifies stress resilience old men woman .</detailed_description>
