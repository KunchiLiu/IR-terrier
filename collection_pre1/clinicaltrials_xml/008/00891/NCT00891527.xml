	<brief_title>Pilot Study Using Avastin Gleevec Treat Progression Intraluminal Pulmonary Vein Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intraluminal pulmonary vein stenosis rare life threaten disease affect infant child . It isolate single pulmonary vein , often occur multiple vessel simultaneously . It occur complicate feature complex congenital heart disease , also occur isolation infant otherwise normal heart . Response conventional surgical transcatheter-based therapy usually short-lived . Typically within 3 4 week obstruction recurs . Repeat surgical attempt provide temporary relief eventually infants die without lung transplantation . While cause disease unknown mechanism progressive obstruction recently determine biopsy autopsy review result neo-proliferative cell identify myofibroblasts cell marker VEGF PDGF . Chemotherapeutic agent Avastin Gleevec show inhibit myo-proliferation marker . The overall objective protocol conduct pilot study use biologic agent Avastin Gleevec treat progression intraluminal pulmonary vein stenosis ( PVS ) . From pilot group 10 patient attempt provide enhance characterization progressive primary disease process , well secondary manifestation . Results analyze descriptively ; data gather pilot study use inform study examine safety efficacy outcomes . The study objective accomplish achievement follow Specific Aims : 1 . To describe feasibility administration Gleevec® without Avastin® treat progression intraluminal PVS patient multivessel disease . Patients PVS conjunction congenital heart disease ( CHD ) receive Gleevec® alone , Avastin® add significant progression occur ; patient primary PVS PVS conjunction lung disease treat drug simultaneously . 2 . To characterize time progression proportion patient survive 48 week enrollment . 3 . To describe toxicity associate administration Gleevec® without Avastin® 48 week course treatment among patient multivessel PVS . Response therapy describe summarize severity obstruction , lobar involvement , lung involvement , leave atrial wall involvement mediastinal involvement measure CT angiography baseline,24,48 72 week cardiac angiography available . Other cardiac assessment technique perform necessary confirm finding . Patients assess oncology team regularly . At time Lab study draw review &amp; physical assessment interim history perform assess occurrence adverse event .</detailed_description>
