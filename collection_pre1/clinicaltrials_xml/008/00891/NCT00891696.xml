	<brief_summary>Muscle wasting , involve loss muscle tissue , common many condition , cancer , AIDS , trauma , kidney failure , bone fracture , sepsis . It also prevalent among elderly people experience period physical inactivity weightlessness . Muscle waste lead overall weakness , immobility , physical dependence , great risk death expose infection , surgery , trauma . There need develop scientifically base treatment prevent muscle waste . As one step towards goal , study examine physiological cellular mechanism regulate skeletal muscle growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Skeletal muscle comprise 40 % one 's body weight contain 50 % 75 % protein human body . The turnover protein regular process human body . In healthy adult , interplay muscle protein synthesis muscle protein breakdown result net growth loss muscle mass . But scale tip towards muscle protein breakdown , muscle waste occur . This result negative consequence , muscle fill obvious role convert chemical energy mechanical energy move maintain posture , muscle also involve follow less apparent role : regulating metabolism ; remove potentially toxic substance blood circulation ; produce fuel tissue ; store energy nitrogen , important fueling brain immune system ; facilitate wound heal malnutrition , starvation , injury , disease . Therefore , muscle important physical independence also mere survival human body . In fact , mere 30 % loss body 's protein result impaired respiration circulation eventually lead death . The purpose study examine physiological cellular mechanism regulate skeletal muscle growth . Results study may help develop future treatment maintain possibly increase muscle mass way improve function , reduce disease complication , increase survival . This study enroll healthy participant randomly assign one several treatment arm within one three separate experiment . Overall , three experiment examine follow : ( 1 ) whether mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) signal pathway -- group molecules work together control specific cellular function -- responsible stimulating muscle protein synthesis resistance exercise and/or ingestion amino acid supplement ; ( 2 ) whether restrict blood flow blood pressure cuff low-intensity resistance exercise ultimately lead muscle protein synthesis ; ( 3 ) whether age associate reduced physiological cellular mechanism related muscle protein synthesis whether reduction overcome post-exercise ingestion amino acid supplement blood flow restriction low-intensity resistance exercise . Depending treatment arm participant assign , may receive amino acid supplementation , drug rapamycin , drug sodium nitroprusside , and/or placebo . They may also undergo high-intensity resistance exercise , low-intensity resistance exercise , low-intensity resistance exercise along blood flow restriction . All participant attend single 8-hour study visit follow-up visit 1 week later . During study visit , participant undergo follow : measurement vital sign , height , weight ; blood urine sampling ; dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan ; infusion study include additional blood sampling , muscle biopsy , assign intervention . The follow-up visit include evaluation incision make infusion study .</detailed_description>
