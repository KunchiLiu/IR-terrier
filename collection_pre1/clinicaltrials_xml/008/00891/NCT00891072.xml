	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose gossypol give together paclitaxel carboplatin treat patient solid tumor metastatic remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , gossypol , paclitaxel , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving gossypol together paclitaxel carboplatin may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary end point determine maximum tolerate dose AT-101 paclitaxel carboplatin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe toxicity associate combination paclitaxel , carboplatin , AT-101 . II . To evaluate human pharmacokinetic disposition AT-101 context escalating dos . III . To describe pharmacokinetics paclitaxel give concurrently AT-101 . IV . To evaluate evidence activity combination paclitaxel , carboplatin AT-101 . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid . Patients receive oral R- ( - ) -gossypol acetic acid twice daily day 1-3 . Patients also receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
