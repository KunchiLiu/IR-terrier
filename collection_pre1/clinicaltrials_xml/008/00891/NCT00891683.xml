	<brief_summary>Two Phase 1 study conduct AEG33773 available safety tolerability data study support clinical development AEG33773 . The current study propose proof-of-concept study ass potential analgesic efficacy AEG33773 reduce pain associate chronic Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy AEG33773 Versus Placebo Patients With Painful Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Doses AEG33773 select evaluation study provide dose range ( i.e. , 100-400 mg ) may potentially include minimally effective dose maximum tolerate dose . Doses 400 mg well tolerate single- multiple-dose Phase 1 study . Before initiation treatment study drug , analgesic medication discontinue 7-day Washout Period , neuropathic pain assess ( absence analgesic medication ) next 3 day ( Pain Assessment Period ) . Pain intensity level 3 day record daily , subject meet predefined pain intensity threshold criterion 3 day eligible receive study drug . Because pain may increase analgesic medication discontinue , combine length Washout Pain Assessment Periods limit order subject experience increase pain time may begin treatment study drug without undue delay . This design allow adequate Baseline pain assessment 3 day avoid prolonged period increase pain absence analgesic medication .</detailed_description>
