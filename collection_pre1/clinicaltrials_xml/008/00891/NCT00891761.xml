	<brief_summary>This phase III study design demonstrate superiority single-dose 90 mg intravenous ( IV ) casopitant placebo , combination ondansetron dexamethasone , prevention emesis first 0-120 hour ( overall phase ) follow initiation cisplatin infusion first cycle highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( HEC ) . Eligibility limited subject schedule receive first cycle chemotherapy include least 60 mg/m2 cisplatin administer Day 1 21 day 28 day cycle . All subject receive IV ondansetron oral dexamethasone Day 1 prior initiation cisplatin infusion , follow oral dexamethasone Days 2-4 . Additionally , subject randomize receive single-dose 90 mg IV casopitant match placebo prior initiation cisplatin-based HEC regimen .</brief_summary>
