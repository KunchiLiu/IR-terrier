	<brief_summary>Asthma disease affect lung . Symptoms include repeat episode wheeze , breathlessness , chest tightness , nighttime early morning coughing . Some people asthma experience worse symptom night , know nocturnal asthma ( NA ) . The reason decline lung function night asthmatic well understood , may link human biological clock , control daily activity sleep rhythm . To determine whether difference biological clock relate worsen nocturnal lung function , study evaluate circadian rhythm people NA , people non-nocturnal asthma , healthy people .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determine Relationship Between Circadian Rhythms Nocturnal Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nocturnal worsening asthma , frequently call NA , common problem among people asthma one lead increase morbidity mortality . It still unknown lung function worsens night asthmatic others . There possible relationship NA , biological clock , circadian rhythm , research need understand relationship . Although diurnal nature NA show repeatedly study , circadian rhythm yet implicate related factor . This study examine pathophysiology NA relate circadian biology specifically explore physiological molecular aspect . This study include people asthma , people NA , healthy people . Potential participant attend screen visit assess general health severity asthma , present . They also complete 2 week diary recording daily symptom airway function . Eligible participant attend two study visit . The first study visit last 1 hour may include methacholine challenge bronchodilator testing , measure lung function . For 2 week second study visit , participant keep record sleep pattern . The second study visit hospital stay last 2.5 day . While hospital , participant undergo periodic blood draw lung function test . During wake hour , participant remain quietly awake . During first night , participant monitor sleep . During second night , participant stay awake 28 hour , continue third day . Then , third day , participant sleep 8 hour monitor . Upon wake , participant give regular meal discharge .</detailed_description>
