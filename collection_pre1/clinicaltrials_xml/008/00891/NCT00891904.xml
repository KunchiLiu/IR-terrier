	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Stereotactic body radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving stereotactic body radiation therapy together cetuximab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study side effect radiation therapy give together cetuximab see well work treat patient recurrent head neck cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Cetuximab Treating Patients With Recurrent Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess toxicity stereotactic body radiotherapy deliver concurrently cetuximab patient recurrent squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Secondary - To assess feasibility deliver regimen patient . - To assess impact regimen local control , distant control , overall survival patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive cetuximab IV 60-120 minute weekly week 1-5 . Patients undergo 1 fraction stereotactic-body radiotherapy ( RT ) week 2 . At 4 week RT completion , patient may receive additional cetuximab IV combine 28-day chemotherapy regimen , per investigator discretion . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 1 year , every 3-4 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
