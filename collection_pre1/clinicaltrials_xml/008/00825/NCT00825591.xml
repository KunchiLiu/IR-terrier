	<brief_summary>Background : Optic Nerve Hypoplasia ( ONH ) lead cause blindness child . For unclear reason , incidence ONH increasing , ONH affect 1 10,000 live-born infant . In addition visual deficit , ONH associate vary degree hypopituitarism , developmental delay , brain malformation obesity . Although genetic mutation rarely observe result ONH , cause ONH largely know . In limited anatomical observation , suprachiasmatic nucleus ( SCN ) locate anterior hypothalamus , generate circadian rhythm , observe abnormal child ONH . Thus , child ONH may biological clock dysfunction . In collaborative study Dr. Mark Borchert Childrens Hospital Los Angeles ( CHLA ) , recently discover one-half child ONH grossly abnormal sleep-wake pattern , assess actigraphy . Although known child ONH , abnormal sleep-wake pattern observe associated neurocognitive impairment obesity . We also observe nocturnal melatonin administration improve abnormal sleep-wake cycle child , raise possibility possible treat abnormal rhythmicity child ONH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Hypotheses . Our objective define scope problem related biological clock disorder child ONH develop effective treatment condition . Based observation , hypothesize : ( 1 ) Daily rest-activity pattern sleep abnormal 50 % child ONH . ( 2 ) It possible identify risk factor abnormal circadian system function sleep problem ONH . ( 3 ) Nocturnal melatonin administration improve abnormal sleep activity pattern child ONH . Design : These study involve collaborative effort Yale University Dr. Mark Borchert Childrens Hospital Los Angeles , follow large population child ONH world . We study child age 2-10 year document ONH use standard criterion . Based criterion , 100 eligible patient . To test hypothesis , : ( 1 ) examine express rhythmicity child ONH . These study use actigraphy , sleep questionnaire , assessment melatonin secretory profile . ( 2 ) We correlate hypothalamic anatomical abnormality degree endocrine dysfunction sleep express rhythmicity . ( 3 ) We test short-term administration melatonin improve sleep-wake pattern child abnormally-expressed rhythmicity . Potential Impact : Our preliminary data raise possibility child ONH circadian system dysfunction result abnormal rhythmicity sleep . However , date formal attempt identify child ONH risk problem , effort aim develop potential treatment . The propose prospective clinical study represent important attempt identify group child circadian system dysfunction . At completion study , anticipate determine risk factor circadian system dysfunction child ONH . Insights gain study lead development new approach treat circadian clock lesion ONH , hope improve well-being circadian system function boys girls condition .</detailed_description>
