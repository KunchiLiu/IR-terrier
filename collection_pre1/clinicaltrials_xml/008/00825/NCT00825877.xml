	<brief_summary>The Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-term Treatment Cirrhosis ( HALT-C ) trial multicenter clinical trial conduct assess effect long-term antiviral drug therapy progression liver disease patient advance chronic hepatitis C respond prior therapy . Chronic hepatitis C long-lasting viral infection affect liver may lead permanent liver damage cirrhosis ( replacement healthy liver cell scar tissue ) . If leave untreated , proportion patient chronic hepatitis C risk complication liver disease . The drug therapy HALT-C trial design clear hepatitis C virus patient system order prevent mitigate potential complication . The purpose research determine patient chronic hepatitis C experience clearance hepatitis C virus ( know sustain virologic response , SVR ) HALT-C trial develop complication liver disease . This study include 180 subject participate initial phase HALT-C trial experience SVR . The participant visit National Institutes Health in-person study visit . During visit , patient blood draw lab test monitor progress liver disease , may ask undergo ultrasound examination liver detect abnormality may attribute liver cancer . Patients also answer question medical history particularly outcomes event related hepatitis C occur since HALT-C trial may ask sign release information allow researcher obtain medical record clinic physician receive treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects achieve sustain virologic response participation multicentered HALT-C clinical trial treatment chronic hepatitis C invite return single clinic visit ass whether decompensation event ( e.g . ascites , varicela hemorrhage , hepatic encephalopathy ) hepatocellular cancer occur . Subjects able willing return NIH undergo standard clinical examination , questionnaire ultrasound examination liver , ass status hepatitis C. Data pool 10 clinical center , analyze compare age gender match control group nonresponder subject participate HALT-C Trial .
