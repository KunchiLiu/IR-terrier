	<brief_summary>Spastic equinovarus foot ( SEF ) major cause disability stroke patient . Treatments may include physical therapy , orthosis , botulinum toxin ( BTX ) injection selective neurotomy . Several RCT placebo-controlled study demonstrate improvement spasticity , pain active ankle dorsiflexion BTX injection . Unfortunately , BTX expensive treatment effect last three month . Selective neurotomy consist partial section motor nerve innervate spastic muscle responsible SEF , lead permanent treatment SEF . Until , neurotomy assess observational case-report study never submit RCT . The aim study evaluate benefit selective tibial neurotomy case SEF accord 3 domain ICF , compare BTX injection , among prospective , randomize , control single blind study : would allow promote permanent cost-effective treatment case SEF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Selective Tibial Neurotomy Treatment Spastic Equinovarus Foot Among Adult Hemiplegic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Stroke third cause death lead cause handicap among industrialized country ( 1 ) . Spasticity follow stroke responsible spastic equinovarus foot ( SEF ) 18 % case ( 2 ) . Spastic equinovarus foot due spasticity ( muscle hypertonia ) calf muscle ( soleus , gastrocnemius tibialis posterior ) , often complicate contracture weakness peroneus longus peroneus brevis muscle ( 3 ) . Therefore , stroke patient walk slowly , often require assistive device orthosis cane . This disability limit social participation quality life . Spastic equinovarus foot treatment include oral medication , physical therapy , orthosis , chemical denervations ( botulinum toxin , alcohol phenol injection ) , selective neurotomy orthopedic surgery ( 4 , 5 ) . Intra-muscular botulinum toxin injection induces chemical denervation reduce spasticity inject muscle . Functional block neuromuscular junction due botulinum toxin reversible last 3 month . Therefore , expensive treatment must regularly administer , risk antibody development . Selective neurotomy neurosurgical procedure consist partially selectively cut motor branch innervate spastic muscle . For low cost , permanently reduce muscle spasticity . Botulinum toxin injection effectiveness largely demonstrate spastic equinovarus foot treatment double-blind randomise control trial placebo ( 6 , 7 , 8 ) . Selective tibial nerve neurotomy effectiveness suggest spastic equinovarus foot treatment uncontrolled unrandomised case report ( 9 , 10 , 11 ) . International Classification Functioning , Disability Health ( ICF ) World Health Organisation ( www.who.int / icidh , 2001 ) framework Physical Rehabilitation Medicine ( 12 ) . This model describe disease influence patient impairment , activity participation . Spastic equinovarus foot treatment already evaluate impairment field : spasticity , muscle strength , walk parameter gait analysis variable . These treatment also demonstrate effectiveness patient activity ( disability ) participation ( quality life ) . OBJECTIVES The aim present project study effectiveness selective tibial nerve neurotomy spastic equinovarus foot , compare botulinum toxin injection . The functional assessment explore three ICF domain . METHODS We recruit 20 chronic stroke patient present spastic equinovarus foot . This spastic equinovarus foot due calf muscle spasticity without contracture . This spasticity manage effectively physical therapy . First , lidocaïne selective diagnostic motor branch block systematically carry confirm treatment indication , determine muscle / nerve treat ( 14 ) . Once muscle responsible spastic equinovarus foot identify , surgically chemically denervated . Than , patient randomize two group : - One group receive botulinum toxin injection ( toxin group ) . - One group undergo neurotomy ( neurotomy group ) . Patients assess treatment , 2 month 6 month treatment among 3 ICF domain . Impairments assess Stoke Impairment Assessment Set ( SIAS ) , Ashworth Tardieu scale ( spasticity ) MRC scale ( muscle strength ) . Spasticity gait disorder quantitatively objectively evaluated muscle stiffness measurement ( 15 ) instrument gait analysis ( 11 ) . Disability evaluate ABILOCO scale ( 16 ) participation ( quality life ) StrokeQol scale ( 17 ) SF-36 questionnaire . The patient selection , lidocaïne hyperselective diagnostic block , botulinum toxin injection selective neurotomies achieve Cliniques universitaires Mont-Godinne . The functional assessment ( clinical evaluation , gait analysis , muscle stiffness measurement ) achieve Physical Medicine Rehabilitation department ( READ unit ) blind assessor . PERSPECTIVE From study , hope demonstrate effectiveness selective neurotomy spastic equinovarus foot treatment among 3 ICF domain ( impairment , activity participation ) . This promote effective , permanent cheap spastic equinovarus foot treatment .</detailed_description>
