	<brief_title>Coronary CT Angiography Acute Chest Pain Cost Effective Risk Stratification Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Significance Standard-of-care risk-stratification algorithm ( SOC ) : In past 20 year since Goldman et al4 described clinical algorithm predict MI ED patient , clinical ability decrease false-negative rate myocardial event improve . Hence , emergency physician ( EP ) compel admit hospital majority patient present acute chest pain observation investigation due inconclusive evidence ACS MI index ED visit ; false-negatives still send home CAD ; false-positives admit without CAD ; account significant consumption resource every year US1 . The current state art EPs include clinical data , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) cardiac biomarkers5 ( Fig . 1 ) . The limitation use Goldman prediction rule ECG insensitive indicator myocardial injury patient MI4-9 . The sensitivity specificity cardiac biomarkers proportional time onset chest pain . Cardiac troponin begin rise within 3-4 hour onset myocardial injury may remain increased 4-7 day cTnI 10-14 day cTnT10 . There enthusiasm myoglobin early marker ; however , myoglobin non-specific11-16 In ED base trial ; cardiac biomarkers perform well change cost admission rate ( false-positives ) . In 1999 , McCord et al9 publish single center prospective cohort study examine point-of-care cardiac biomarkers first 90 minute could help exclude AMI ED chest pain patient . The post-hoc analysis resultant negative predictive value ( NPV ) 98 99 % time 0 minute , 90 minute , 3-hours various combination three biomarkers include Myoglobin , Troponin I CK-MB . These result demonstrate consistency negative predictive value combination CK-MB myoglobin equal Troponin myoglobin . In 2004 , Fesmire , et al17 report another prospective ED cohort study 2-hour delta CK-MB level outperforms myoglobin level early identification exclusion acute MI effectively risk-stratify patient 30-day adverse outcome . In ED base trial , despite impressive post-hoc NPV McCord et al trial , cost admission rate ( false-positives ) remain since rule-out MI process require admission 24 hour serial cardiac enzyme test . Patients present ED acute chest pain undergo SOC risk-stratification algorithm determine etiology complaint ( Figure 1 ) . The SOC risk-stratification initially include clinical assessment ECG . If ECG reveals ST elevation MI ( STEMI ) patient treat immediately cardiac catheterization laboratory . If ECG normal indeterminate , clinical risk factor , patient undergo cardiac biomarker test . If cardiac biomarkers negative , patient admit hospital testing . If cardiac biomarkers positive , patient admit cardiac care unit ( CCU ) test . If clinical risk factor absent ECG normal , patient may discharge without testing4-8 , however practice small percentage ( 11 % ) patients9 . This practice risk-stratification algorithm continue SOC . However , combination Goldman predictor risk algorithm ( ECG symptom ) Troponin I ( cTnI ) &lt; 0.3 able identify group chest pain patient &lt; 1 % risk composite outcome death , AMI revascularization18 . Further demonstrate need integration additional testing decrease false-positive false-negative rate . Adding nuclear perfusion cardiac test SOC risk-stratification ED : Investigators study add exercise stress test echocardiogram ED SOC risk-stratification acute chest pain . Both exercise stress test echocardiogram enhance addition nuclear perfusion define recent reduction arterial flow specific segment myocardium . Due known weakness exercise test 19 cost add nuclear perfusion enhancement exercise stress test echocardiogram , neither study finding inform standard-of-care risk-stratification algorithm20-22 . Furthermore , apriori clinical research perform cost-analysis confirm obvious excessive expense add nuclear study chest pain patient . However , stress test consider worthy test include risk-stratification algorithm capable detect flow limit stenosis , though establish presence absence coronary artery disease . Adding non-invasive cardiac imaging : Coronary CT angiography ( CTA ) SOC ( CTA + SOC ) risk-stratification ED : Appropriate decision-making low intermediate-risk subgroup patient present acute chest pain require new tool . We postulate perhaps incorporation coronary CTA , provide anatomical window defines amount atherosclerotic burden within coronary tree , advance risk-stratification algorithm low intermediate-risk acute chest pain cost-effective manner . In recent year , much interest noninvasive image technique allow direct visualization assessment coronary artery ( Image A ) . The coronary tree challenge image due continuous motion coronary artery . This motion necessitate high spatial temporal resolution . Recent advance compute tomography ( CT ) technique make image coronary artery possible . The introduction electron-beam CT ( EBCT ) 1984 first allow ECG-synchronized imaging heart . In 1998 , first multiple detector spiral CT ( MDCT ) system 4 detector row introduce , allow great volume coverage rotation CT gantry EBCT . 23 Since time , gantry rotation time decrease , result improved temporal resolution . An increase number detector allow sub-millimeter spatial resolution . At time , 64 slice MDCT ( Image A ) consider `` state art '' technology performance coronary CTA , although next generation scanner , include dual source 256 slice MDCT currently evaluation . Several small study literature show utility coronary CTA safe rapid triage low intermediate-risk acute chest pain patient present ED24-29 . One clinical advantage coronary CTA , unlike stress test detect flow limit stenosis CAD ; detect flow limit stenosis addition presence absence coronary artery disease . The disadvantage coronary CTA exposure radiation . Multiple small trial compare coronary CTA invasive coronary angiography demonstrate sensitivity range 86-99 % specificity range 93-97 % detection hemodynamically significant CAD . The negative predictive value ( NPV ) coronary CTA study uniformly high , range 95-99 % , rate non-evaluable segment low , range 0-12 % 23 , 30-34 . Results multicenter , international CORE-64 trial discuss 2007 American Heart Association Scientific Sessions evaluate diagnostic performance coronary CTA compare interventional coronary angiography 291 patient suspect known CAD Agatston calcium score &lt; 600 . On per patient basis , sensitivity specificity coronary CTA detection significant CAD 85 % 90 % , positive NPV 91 % 83 % 35 . Moreover , 2007 , Meijboom et al36 report utility coronary CTA symptomatic patient low , intermediate , high estimate pretest probability significant CAD . Of 254 patient enrol study , author determine patient low intermediate-risk group find disease coronary CTA later determine disease invasive coronary angiography . Patients present ED acute chest pain could potentially undergo rapid triage coronary CTA , speed diagnosis , lower hospital cost testing . Additional report cost-analyses population add coronary CTA SOC risk-stratification algorithm ( CTA + SOC ) : In study Goldstein et al publish 2007 Journal American College Cardiology , author report ED cost index visit significantly low group receive coronary CTA versus group receive coronary CTA . However , cost difference primarily due decrease length stay ED rather cost associate test , specifically nuclear imaging . This cost analysis limit index ED visit alone ; since study power outcome , cost . No additional cost data gather , although outcome follow-up 6-months . Preliminary cost-outcome data present Chicago 2008 American College Cardiology meeting report ; include coronary CT calcium score protocol screen 495 asymptomatic firefighter , researcher able effectively triage subject follow-up coronary CTA send back work without workup , thus , decrease cost . In another report present , researcher conclude cost decrease out-patient cardiology clinic incorporating coronary CTA risk-stratification cardiac patient lead reduced need myocardial perfusion image exercise treadmill test 6-month period . Moreover , doctor able identify coronary artery disease provide aggressive lipid management . These data illustrate cost outcome study forefront research measure define role coronary CTA . The coronary CTA innovative domain acute chest pain , paucity publish work look cost ; instead , majority literature examines outcomes produce primarily cardiology . Healthcare cost implication add coronary CTA SOC ( CTA + SOC ) ; coronary CTA demonstrate normal coronary artery : The cost implication potentially discharge patient ED find free CAD without test impressive . In May 2008 , data abstract form present Academic EM author report good NPV 568 prospective patient receive coronary CTA ED 30-days . These report lack description design , methodology , state power calculation priori hypothesis . Thus , need definitive apriori cost outcome clinical research application coronary CTA acute chest pain warrant . The effect work define change clinical practice landscape apply innovation cardiac risk-stratification model , particularly acutely present chest pain . Embracing incorporation coronary CTA acute chest pain innovation require well perform clinical trial define patient benefit ; whether apply asymptomatic patient , low , intermediate , and/or high-risk acute chest pain patient remain question .</detailed_description>
