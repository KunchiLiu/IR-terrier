	<brief_summary>There clear marker identify sepsis acute lung injury early stage clinical setting would result improved survival patient . In collaboration research team lead Dr. Zhang St. Michael 's Hospital , Toronto , initiate pilot study look biological marker detect severe sepsis ARDS . We find human neutrophil peptide ( a-defensins ) , certain coagulation variable cytokine level sensitive marker differentiate severe sepsis , ARDS cardiovascular disease ICU patient . These finding may provide valuable information therapeutic guideline clinical practice . The present study focus test 'biological marker ' identify patient sepsis acute lung injury . We examine role three component marker include inflammation , neutrophil activation coagulation . We hop propose translational research help develop novel therapeutic strategy sepsis acute lung injury patient .</brief_summary>
