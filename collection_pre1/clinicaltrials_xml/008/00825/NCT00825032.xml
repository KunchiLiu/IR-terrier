	<brief_summary>Recent guideline pulmonary rehabilitation ( PR ) recommend upper extremity exercise training ( UEET ) patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The theory support inclusion upper extremity exercise training pulmonary rehabilitation patient , base profound understanding activity accessory respiratory muscle , competitively involved support upper extremity activity ventilation . However , systematic review literature carry staff reveals clinical trial carry verify effectiveness UEET poor methodological quality investigator corroborate recommendation recently make basis result investigator ' review . Therefore investigator begin randomize , parallel group , control clinical trial purpose determine short-term effect unsupported UEET performance upper extremity symptom perceive activity patient COPD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We recruit inpatient stable , moderate severe COPD refer PR program regional centre Villa Pineta Hospital . Patients randomize two group : control intervention . Patients randomize control group undertake inpatient comprehensive PR comply recommendation make ATS/ERS include minimum 15 daily session specific train low extremity . Patients randomized intervention group undertook experimental program consist 15 additional daily session unsupported UEET PR program use control patient . Measurements upper extremity performance symptom perceive take group baseline ( T0 ) completion intervention ( Tend ) one physiotherapist unaware patient 's group allocation . To verify experimental training lead long-term result functional arm exercise capacity , measurement repeat 6-months late follow-up ( T6months ) .</detailed_description>
