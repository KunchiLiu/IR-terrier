	<brief_summary>Colon cancer third common cancer western society . To prevent colon cancer recommend people undergo screen colonoscopy age fifty . The purpose colonoscopy remove polyp , since lesion precancerous . Precancerous polyp call adenomas . This method prevention effective , standard colonoscopy currently use detect polyp . Studies report polyp miss rate 24 % . Furthermore , unable distinguish precancerous polyp benign polyp , also know hyperplastic polyp , standard colonoscopy . This result polyps removed time colonoscopy , even benign polyp . To help improve detection colon polyps new endoscopic technology develop . These technology include high definition white light ( HDWL ) high definition narrow band imaging ( HDNBI ) . HDWL improve overall resolution image see colonoscopy . HDNBI help u good classify polyp enhance tissue appearance well see small blood vessel capillary . The goal study determine HDNBI imaging show increase polyp detection rate compare current standard colonoscopy . In addition develop classification system help good differentiate precancerous polyp benign counterpart use HDWL HDNBI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>II . Hypothesis : 1 . The use NBI colonoscopy reduce miss rate colon polyp compare standard white light image . 2 . HDWl HDNBI accurate standard colonoscopy classification adenomatous polyp comparison non-premalignant polyp . III . Specific Aims : 1 . Compare miss rate standard white light image compare NBI detection colon polyp NBI 2 . Estimate accuracy standard white light , HDWL HDNBI image mode classification adenomatous ( premalignant ) versus non-adenomatous ( hyperplastic , inflammatory , normal ) polyp . 3 . Examine inter-observer agreement classification adenomatous versus non-adenomatous polyp base standard , NBI HDWL imaging . IV . Research Design Methods : 4.1 Study Design : A prospective phase II cross-over trial . Patients undergo procedure ( standard , NBI ) back back conscious sedation . The order procedure randomize . 4.2 Setting : The study take place Mayo Clinic Jacksonville , Division Gastroenterology , expert center diagnosis treatment colon polyp . 4.3 Study Subjects All patient schedule colonoscopy Mayo Clinic Jacksonville screen eligibility use inclusion exclusion criterion . The patient deem eligible offer participation study . Informed consent obtain participant registered database . Prior consent participant make aware investigative nature study , alternative , risk , benefit . 4.4 Eligibility Criteria Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Age 18 year old . 2 . Informed write consent . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . History inflammatory bowel disease . 2 . Patients severe cardiopulmonary disease preclude colonoscopy . 3 . Presence condition allow polypectomy biopsy ( e.g . coagulation disorder ) . 4 . Known familial polyposis syndrome ( FAP , HNPCC , Juvenile polyposis , etc ) 5 . Sub-optimal preparation procedure , determine patient history base initial colonoscopy . 6 . Pregnancy 4.5 Procedure Data Collections A. Pre-procedure : All patient prepare colonoscopy standard preparation schedule procedure Mayo Clinic Jacksonville . The principal investigator ( PI ) screen eligible patient base medical history , physical exam laboratory data day procedure . Patients typically arrive registration area least 60 minute start schedule procedure . A GI endoscopy nurse prepare patient standard manner intravenous access place . Eligible patient offer informed consent study PI designee . Patients agree participate study sign inform consent register database . A log non-identifiable ( e.g . patient # 1 ) also maintain eligible patient decline participate . The GI endoscopy nurse monitor patient 's vitals , procedure per standard protocol . B . Procedure : The exam perform back back standard colonoscope ETMI colonoscope provide Olympus . The order first second procedure randomize accord list prepared statistician use randomly permute block ensure equal number patient randomize two group . All patient sedate meperidine fentanyl midazolam achieve conscious sedation . Each procedure preform different endoscopist . The endoscopist either P.I . supervise GI staff physician solely one five GI staff physician . During initial colonoscopy visualize polyp note , photograph , remove . When ETMI colonoscope use , polyp photograph use mode ( HDWL , HDNBI ) . The NBI portion exam perform use MB-046 cap enhance stabilization focal length colonoscope . The second procedure do level careful inspection first although specifically regiment time withdrawal beyond endoscopist feel necessary careful examination . During second colonoscopy visualize polyp note , photograph remove . During first procedure , time evaluate stopwatch . The stopwatch start endoscopist begin pull-back cecum end scope remove anal verge . The clock stop wash bowel , polypectomy , biopsy therapeutic maneuver . At end first procedure , endoscopist inform withdrawal inspection time every effort make match second procedure . Time record similarly second procedure . Polyps classify pedunculated , raised-sessile ( round ) flat . Flat polyp classify accord Paris endoscopic classification 14 . C. Post-procedure : After procedure patient bring recovery monitor per standard protocol . Participants give discharge instruction per protocol also provide information contact P.I . problem occur . Any post procedure complication review weekly interval .</detailed_description>
