	<detailed_description>The study run August 2008 May 2009 . Recruitment screen participant occur August December 2008 inclusion clinical trial . Prior clinical trial participant one hour informational session clearly present study , obtain sign informed consent set fitness/blood appointment data collection . Data collection begin first week school January . The 12-week exercise protocol start second week school continue middle April . Research participant exercise session spring break ( March 16-20 ) . Final data collection occur last two week school . Pre-treatment post-treatment data collection include fitness assessment blood draw . Medication usage asthma monitor weekly basis thoughout clinical trial . Physical activity also monitor monthly . The screen session 30-minute session research participant complete health/behavior questionnaire physiological measure lung function . Information collect health/behavior questionnaire include : demographic behavioral/lifestyle variable ( sex , race , age , smoke status , medical history ) . The fitness assessment 60 minute length . At begin session participant complete survey ass state anxiety ( State-Trait Anxiety Inventory - Trait version Form X-1 ; Spielberger , Gorsuch , &amp; Lushene , 1970 ) . Heart rate variability measure ventral placement 3 electrode place subject 's torso . The area prepped swab alcohol lightly scrub remove dead skin . The electrode hold place sticky disc strip athletic tape . Heart rate rest blood pressure also take . Body composition assess use BodPod system . Research participant sit enclose capsule ( bod pod ) three test last approximately 40 second . Lung function assess use spirometer measure maximal volume air exhale period time maximal inhalation . To assess cardiorespiratory fitness research participant complete VO2 Max test . Participants ride bicycle ergometer approximately 15-20 minute move stage ( include 3 minute warm-up ) progressively high resistance level maximum tolerance . After termination cool-down/recovery period approximately 3-4 minute . The blood draw session take approximately 30 minute participant ask fast ( food drink ) 12 hour prior blood draw . Upon check-in participant complete series questionnaire assess psychological variable stress ( Perceived Stress Scale-14 item version Form X-1 ; Cohen , Kamarck &amp; Mermelstein , 1983 ) , depression ( Center Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale ; Radloff , 1977 ) , quality life ( Asthma Impact Survey ; QualityMetric Health Outcomes Solutions , Lincoln , RI ) . The quality quantity sleep also assess use Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( Buysse , Reynolds , Monk , Berman , &amp; Kupfer , 1989 ) . Once questionnnaires complete , participant blood drawn certified phlebotomist . Three day blood draw particpants contact phone question current health status . After first week pretreatment data collection , train session begin , research participant undergo explanation training session learn evaluate rate perceive exertion ( RPE ) . The water-based exercise program 3 time week 12 week . The exercise session begin 10-minute warm end 5-minute cool period . The condition portion exercise program shorter duration low intensity begin 12 week . There progression high intensity longer period time throughout 12 week use recommendation American College Sports Medicine . Exercise session exceed 50 minute .</detailed_description>
