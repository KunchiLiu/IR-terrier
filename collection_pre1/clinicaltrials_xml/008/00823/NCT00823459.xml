	<brief_summary>A single-arm , one-stage phase II trial RAD001 undertaken . Sixty patient enrol . The target population patient diagnosis low-grade glioma experience recurrence undergo biopsy subtotal resection time recurrence pathologic evidence recurrent glioma . The purpose study accrue patient evaluate pharmacologic agent . The study drug RAD001 self-administered ( patient ) . RAD001 administer orally daily dose 10 mg ( two 5 mg tablet ) continuously study day 1 progression disease unacceptable toxicity .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 Patients must life expectancy &gt; 8 week Adequate bone marrow function show : ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L , Hb &gt; 9 g/dL Adequate liver function show : serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN INR &lt; 1.3 ( Anticoagulation allow target INR ≤ 1.5 stable dose warfarin stable dose LMW heparin &gt; 2 week time registration ) ALT AST ≤ 2.5x ULN Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Patients must histologically prove intracranial lowgrade glioma initial diagnosis . Patients must unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence progression histology determine review pathology attend neuropathologist UCSF If recent histology show progression high grade glioma , patient must prior radiotherapy order eligible Paraffinembedded section tissue acquire surgery time suspect recurrence must available analysis Patients must evidence tumor recurrence progression MRI determine radiographic review image attend neurooncologist neuroradiologist UCSF An MRI must use throughout period protocol treatment tumor measurement Patients may treatment ( include radiotherapy ) number relapse prior recurrence Patients must least 4 week completion radiation therapy Patients must less 4 month surgical procedure recurrence Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy : 4 week investigational agent . 4 week prior cytotoxic therapy ( except 6 week nitrosoureas , 3 week procarbazine , 3 week vincristine ) 3 week noncytotoxic biologic agent e.g. , interferon , tamoxifen , thalidomide , cisretinoic acid , etc Patients , recover side effect major surgery significant traumatic injury patient may require major surgery course study Patients receive chronic , systemic treatment corticosteroid another immunosuppressive agent . Topical inhale corticosteroid , treatment low dose Decadron ( £ 6mg daily ) allow . Other malignancy within past 3 year except adequately treat carcinoma cervix basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Other surgery , patient may therapy recurrence ( include radiation ) . Supportive care steroid antiepileptic constitute treatment recurrence Patients must enzyme induce antiepileptic agent within 5 day start protocol therapy Patients must significant medical illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient 's ability tolerate therapy . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year ineligible . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine within one week study entry study period Uncontrolled brain leptomeningeal metastasis , include patient continue require glucocorticoid brain leptomeningeal metastases Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Symptomatic congestive heart failure New York heart Association Class III IV unstable angina pectoris , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within 6 month start study drug , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia clinically significant cardiac disease Impaired lung function : Oxygen saturation 88 % less rest room air Pulse Oximetry . If O2 saturation ≤ 88 % rest , pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) order confirm normal pulmonary function eligibility . uncontrolled diabetes define fast serum glucose &gt; 1.5 x ULN active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled severe infection liver disease cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis chronic persistent hepatitis A known history HIV seropositivity Impairment gastrointestinal function gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption RAD001 ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome small bowel resection ) Patients active , bleed diathesis Female patient pregnant breast feeding , adult reproductive potential use effective birth control method . Patients receive prior treatment mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus ) . Patients know hypersensitivity RAD001 ( everolimus ) rapamycins ( sirolimus , temsirolimus ) excipients</criteria>
