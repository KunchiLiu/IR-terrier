	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine amount improvement bladder function pain relief administration 2 % alkalinized lidocaine patient interstitial cystitis . Specifically , want see administration 2 % alkalinized lidocaine treatment bladder improves urodynamic test result value . We hope enroll approximately 40 patient study . Previous research show administration 2 % alkalinized lidocaine bladder may improve bladder 's capacity hold urine urine flow rate simultaneously provide pain relief . As part standard care Smith Institute Urology Pelvic Pain Center , routinely offer IC patient 2 % alkalinized lidocaine follow urodynamic evaluation . Our research look expand upon prior study confirm finding improve bladder function enhance pain control 2 % alkalinized lidocaine versus placebo perform second urodynamic evaluation , routinely perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interstitial cystitis ( IC ) chronic bladder condition include symptom bladder pelvic pain well irritative voiding symptom ( urgency , frequency , nocturia , dysuria ) . The syndrome usually diagnose clinically rule possible infectious neoplastic cause . Due lack standardize diagnostic criterion , report prevalence IC United States varies widely 35 24,000 per 100,000 persons1,2 . Regardless , doubt IC source much distress profoundly affect quality life . IC patient report low quality life dialysis patient . They 6 time likely general population cut work time owe health problem higher report incidence depression , chronic pain , anxiety overall mental health2 , The exact pathophysiology etiology IC completely understand much advancement knowledge . The etiology likely multifactorial study show role epithelial dysfunction , inflammatory event well neurological dysfunction [ Figure 1 ] . An initiating event infection , trauma , autoimmune disorder lead dysfunctional urothelium4 . Activation upregulation sensory nerve occurs , lead mast cell activation release histamine mediators5,6 . This , turn , lead cycle symptom IC patient . Due multifactorial nature pathogenesis , IC treatment complicate involves multimodal treatment target different factor . Tricyclic antidepressant control regulation activation nerves7 . Antihistamines target mast cell activation8 heparinoids pentosan polysulfate sodium ( PPS ) heparin target dysfunction epithelium . Heparin one commonly use intravesical agent treatment IC . It find effective almost 50 % patients9 . While heparinoid therapy enhances barrier effect disrupt urothelium , directly target sensory nerve bladder . Hence , may take 2 year treatment severely affect patient feel symptomatic relief10 . Furthermore , symptomatic relief achieve , sustain long11 . Urologists aim develop therapy would directly affect sensory nerve bladder provide immediate symptomatic relief . The use intravesical lidocaine severe IC first report Sweden 1989 . Asklin et al. , report one patient receive repeated intravesical instillation lidocaine achieve much relief13 . Success treatment subsequently report another patient 199214 . Surprisingly , study clinical efficacy intravesical lidocaine IC patient since . To date , study involve intravesical lidocaine lack randomization control group . It difficult determine influence exist placebo effect intravesical instillation . One study conduct 2005 Parsons et al. , test efficacy heparin combine intravesical lidocaine 47 newly diagnose IC patient . 75 % patient report significant improvement symptom one instillation symptomatic relief last least 4 hour . Significant improvement symptom report 94 % patient receive second instillation use high concentration lidocaine . Of 20 patient receive course 6 instillation 2 week , 80 % report sustained relief15 . Welk Telchman look specifically dyspareunia response intravesical lidocaine 23 IC patient . 57 % report resolution dyspareunia . They also find significant difference response rate patient bladder tenderness patient multiple tender location vaginal exam ( 85 % versus 29 % respectively ) 16 . Urodynamic study perform IC patient generally demonstrate normal cystometry , although IC patient characteristic reduction bladder capacity secondary pain hypersensitivity bladder dilation3 . In recent retrospective study , Srinivasan et al observe statistically significant difference appreciable compare pre post lidocaine UDS evaluation bladder capacity , maximum flow rate , first strong sensation void . 12 The impact alkalinize lidocaine UDS parameter , however , remain elusive deserve well design randomize control trial .</detailed_description>
