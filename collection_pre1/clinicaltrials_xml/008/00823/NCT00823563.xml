	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate possible cause chest pain ( anginal equivalent , fatigue result decrease exercise tolerance , shortness breath , back , shoulder , neck , jaw pain ) people evidence significant coronary artery disease coronary angiogram ( picture blood vessel heart ) . The purpose research study determine diffuse atherosclerosis ( plaque ) appreciate angiography , coronary endothelium ( line blood vessel heart ) and/or microcirculation ( small vessel heart easily see angiogram ) function properly chest pain ( anginal equivalent ) , normal coronary artery angiography . Specifically , interested finding common woman men .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sex Differences Coronary Pathophysiology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women likely men chest pain suggestive angina normal-appearing coronary artery angiography , ultimately impart significant morbidity/mortality economic burden . Recent evidence suggest woman commonly endothelial microcirculatory dysfunction , well diffusely distribute atherosclerosis -- disorder cause chest pain , see angiography . This present intriguing basis pathophysiologic difference woman men , study actually compare presence finding woman men . The objective research project determine incidence pathophysiologic difference truly high woman men . We hope determine high incidence diffuse atherosclerotic plaque , endothelial dysfunction , and/or microcirculatory dysfunction woman compare men . If sex difference exists , significant implication test treat woman chest pain angiographically normal coronary artery .</detailed_description>
