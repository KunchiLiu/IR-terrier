	<brief_summary>The investigator develop two new medical instrument : 1. Intelligent Sensor Belt ( ISB ) , 2. Body Composition Hydration Status Analyzer ( BC-HS-A ) . ISB serve purpose measure calorie/ energy consumption human body physical activity . The BC-HS-A measure body composition , i.e . fat lean body mass hydration status i.e amount water inside outside body cell . The goal pilot study obtain data investigator prototype medical instrument : 1 . ISB , 2 . BC-HS-A physical exercise compare result reading commercially available instrument exercise equipment . The investigator would test technical feasibility , comparison exist measure device , reliability investigator prototype .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our goal development non-invasive , Portable Comprehensive Metabolic Monitoring System ( PCMMS ) continuous measurement monitoring parameter human energy metabolism . The current project focus development two hardware component PCMMS : 1. Intelligent Sensor Belt ( ISB ) , 2. Body Composition ( BC ) &amp; Hydration Status ( HS ) Analyzer ( BC -- HS-A ) . ISB design worn around chest waist measure energy expenditure physical activity ( PAE ) via sensor heart rate , tri-axial acceleration , temperature . BC-HS-A utilizes multi-frequency bio-impedance measurement electrodes attached one hand opposite foot . This instrument use continuously intermittently momentary value BC HS desire . This pilot study design obtain data instrument limited exercise session gage function determine feasibility intend use . The pilot study perform healthy volunteer would wear ISB grade cardiac stress test various exercise machine stationary bicycle , treadmill , stair case , row machine . PAE measure ISB compare estimate result particular exercise equipment . The BC measure function BC-HS-A compare commercially available bioimpedance analyzer . Changes hydration status exercise measure BC-HS-A compare precision measurement body weight exercise estimate total water loss body . All result report peer-reviewed journal .</detailed_description>
