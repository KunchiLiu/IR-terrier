	<brief_summary>It recognize fracture distal radius forearm occur approximately one 100 child adolescent every year . Though closed manipulation cast immobilization displace injury mainstay treatment majority case , optimal type cast remain debatable . Though well-molded cast theoretically provide best ability maintain fracture alignment , risk circumferential immobilization acute injury include neurovascular compromise . Splitting , bivalving , cast may reduce risk , effect fracture stability unknown . The propose investigation seek address simple question whether circumferential bivalved cast provide best outcome .</brief_summary>
