	<brief_summary>Penetrating wound heart may present emergency unit presence blood pericardial sac determine ultrasound . If patient stable , study hypothesis manage simple surgical procedure call subxyphoid pericardial window ( SXW ) , blood drain around heart via small skin incision rib cage . In centre world case manage open chest surgery call sternotomy . The investigator 's experience deal injury unnecessary require large amount resource benefit patient . In study , patient randomize receive either open chest surgery ( sternotomy ) much small operation SXW . The patient follow respect hospital stay complication develop . Normally , patient undergo open chest surgery stay intensive care unit minimum 2 day total hospital stay least 7 day risk number complication pneumonia . Patients undergo SXW usually remain hospital period 3 day require intensive care management . The investigator 's hypothesis patient heart injury seal patient longer danger . It necessary perform open chest surgery patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Management Blood Pericardial Sac After Penetrating Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : This first prospective , randomized clinical study ever perform penetrate cardiac injury world literature . A group patient penetrate chest injury present haemodynamically stable , blood pericardial sac diagnose ultrasound . The accepted international management term ; `` stable haemopericardium '' median sternotomy . In experience Cape Town , median sternotomy perform case , cardiac injury present already seal cardiac injury . We feel patient manage much small simpler operation require admission intensive care unit post-operatively merely drainage blood around pericardial sac via subxyphoid window ( SXW ) . Method A SXW perform general anaesthetic involve 5 cm incision sternum . The pericardial sac open blood drain . This small operation also allow heart examine active bleeding . If active bleeding obviously , median sternotomy require fix hole heart . If active bleeding patient randomize either median sternotomy ( international norm ) pericardial sac merely drain soft drain surgery perform . The randomization computer generate . The patient document respect intensive care stay total hospital stay . Any complication note patient follow order ensure patient underwent SXW alone alive well . This essential ensure safety much small procedure condition . Informed consent sign patient patient must older 18 year age .</detailed_description>
