	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well bendamustine hydrochloride work treat patient anaplastic glioma glioblastoma come back ( recurrent ) grow , spread get bad ( progressive ) . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bendamustine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Anaplastic Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary endpoint study 6-month progression-free survival-i.e. , proportion patient remain alive free tumor progression 6 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety single agent bendamustine ( Treanda ) ( bendamustine hydrochloride ) treatment malignant glioma . II . To determine efficacy bendamustine ( Treanda ) single agent assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) 6 month . III . To assess quality life use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Brain ( FACT-BR ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 2 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
