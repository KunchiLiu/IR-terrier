	<brief_summary>Research show immune system involve chronic pain . The immune system involve process inflammation . The investigator still learn factor cause inflammation , know measure blood . The purpose study understand negative thought affect immune system woman chronic pain . A sub-study asks subject store blood sample future research PI aim identify genetic marker woman chronic pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pain Catastrophizing Cause Systemic Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A main goal study well understand pain mechanic . Research link pro-inflammatory cytokine development progression pain . Research also link female gender increase pro-inflammatory cytokine ( relative male ) follow psychological stress . Therefore , hypothesize woman study evidence significantly increase pro-inflammatory cytokine follow pain catastrophizing may risk progression pain condition . The sample 60 woman chronic musculoskeletal pain ( enroll 75 person account attrition screen failure require usable data 60 woman ) . Based enrollment rate previous study , give expand catchment area , expect enroll 60 person within approximately 14 month complete experimental phase study within approximately 17 month . The follow-up phase study continue , long participant agree follow 10 year . The study design randomize , control experiment . Participants consent enrolled impression undergo one stress experiment day ( last 5.5 hour ) . However , study day randomize subject either control group catastrophizing ( stress ) group . Screening Visit : The purpose visit determine eligibility obtain informed consent . Inclusion exclusion criterion assess medical record review , screen interview , hormonal bloodspot kit . A questionnaire also give determine level depressive symptom assess suicidality . The hormonal bloodspot kit involve finger prick obtain 5-6 drop blood . If lab analysis kit determine abnormal hormonal level , person exclude participation study . Participants give saliva kit gather 4 saliva sample home course one day . Participants store saliva sample refrigerator . They either bring kit time study visit mail kit prepaid box give ( hormone saliva shelf stable 3 week ; ask participant refrigerate sample immediately mail bring study site . In way best ensure sample preserve usable ) . All participant enrol study impression participate catastrophizing experiment study day . However , half participant actually experience 10-minute stress experiment experiment day . We include minor form deceit protocol control anticipatory stress expect experience negative emotional experiment . We highlight mild deception occur half sample ( go control group ) represent decrease risk person . Study Visit : This study visit schedule occur follicular phase menstrual cycle ( phase follow menstrual period easy predict sample normally menstruate woman use calendar ) . If difficulty encounter predict date follicular phase , participant call PI study coordinator menstrual period begin schedule study date ( approximately 5-6 day onset menses ) . All participant arrive fast state , follicular phase control sex-steroid influence immunity . 3ml blood drawn hormone level . The hormone level analyze time , save end study analysis , need . A complete cardiometabolic panel measure via bloodspot . If subject agrees take part sub study , take additional 10mL blood extra bloodspot card store future pain/genomic research . Pain rating assess , questionnaire complete . Standardized meal ( caffeine ) serve participant ( breakfast , lunch , snack ) . An OCTRI research nurse place intravenous catheter arm participant 's choosing . A Holter heart monitor place participant nurse . This portable device measure heart beat . Placement lead around heart involve clean skin . The monitor remain affixed duration study visit . At point participant randomize either control group catastrophizing group use random number generator . After randomized one two group , deception reveal control group , rationale explain . Those randomized stress group inform deception , rationale use , conclusion study visit . Those control group serum measurement take time point list study activity table . They occupy next 4.5 hour activity option keep sleep study visit , read magazine , crossword puzzle , game . We hand , bring visit . At time point , salivary cortisol , heart rate , blood pressure , pain rating assess . At end final blood draw , IV catheter remove first study visit complete . Those person randomize catastrophizing group undergo 10min pain catastrophizing induction follow 25 min post- IV catheterization rest period ( also call stress experiment ) . The PI guide participant focus pain , imagine worsen near future , describe worsen pain affect life domain important . The induction standardize follow way : 1 ) duration induction ( 10 minute ) ; 2 ) imaginal focus pain worsen near future ; 3 ) participant guide describe anticipate negative consequence pain worsen ; 4 ) participant guide describe way feel helpless imagining scenario . Items 2-4 design tap 3 component pain catastrophizing ( rumination , magnification pain , helplessness ) . Pain rating stress response measure via heart rate blood pressure salivary cortisol accord study activity table . No bloodspot kit collect visit . This study visit end 270min post-induction blood draw . The PI debrief subject assess affective state . Free counseling offer subject leaf study visit ( one person previous study opt post-study counseling ) . If anyone stress group would like counsel referral PI provide local option . All participant receive next-day telephone call ass mood state adverse event . Long-term Follow-Up : We include separate consent form allow u follow subject time . A main goal study well understand pain mechanic . Research link pro-inflammatory cytokine development progression pain . Research also link female gender increase pro-inflammatory cytokine ( relative male ) follow psychological stress . Therefore , hypothesize woman study evidence significantly increase pro-inflammatory cytokine follow pain catastrophizing may risk progression pain condition . We expect follow sample time , see trend serve preliminary data allow u investigate . While catastrophizing experiment provide u meaningful data , longitudinal sub study allow u define clinical functional relevance finding . For consent relate study , subject contact every 6 month 10 year ask several question pain , mood , function , stress level . They also ask complete 4 questionnaire include : Oswestry Disability Index , The CES-D form , Perceived Stress Scale . These questionnaire read subject phone complete paper . If subject would like complete paper , address , stamp return envelope provide . They also ask contact 6 month .</detailed_description>
