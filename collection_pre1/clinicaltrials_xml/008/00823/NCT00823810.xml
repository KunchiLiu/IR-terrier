	<brief_summary>Measuring tumor response treatment base compute tomography ( CT ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) widely debate issue ( response criterion solid tumor [ RECIST ] World Health Organization criterion ) . Furthermore , early identification nonresponding patient great importance rate response common malignant solid tumor chemotherapy range 20-30 % . Therefore , quantitative image tumor metabolism 18F-FDG PET/CT may provide important advantage thus reduce side effect cost ineffective therapy . However , evidence date use 18F-FDG-PET/CT indication limit . The purpose present trial determine impact 18F-FDG PET/CT management advance colorectal cancer . The aim also confirm whether metabolic response use surrogate end point monitor treatment response cancer type . The study consist 40 patient advanced colorectal cancer patient . All patient study 18F-FDG PET/CT combine diagnostic contrast enhance abdominal CT start chemotherapy re-evaluated 4-5 week initiation therapy . Effect metabolic anatomic change therapy evaluate correlated survival , morbidity , treatment -related cost . Histopathologic confirmation response evaluate whenever possible . The data collect 2008 2012 .</brief_summary>
