	<brief_summary>Histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) like LBH589 recently establish novel potent anti-cancer agent solid hematologic malignancy . Several pre-clinical report show good anti-tumoral activity different HDACi human murine HCC model . These compound , e.g . Trichostatin A , SAHA , MS-275 others , show induce apoptosis HCC cell inhibit growth HCC inhibit proliferation tumor-related angiogenesis vivo . Furthermore , HDACi sensitize HCC synergistic manner form cytotoxic stimulation , e.g . conventional chemotherapeutic drug TRAIL-mediated apoptosis . It also show combination HDACi various kinase inhibitor like sorafenib , erlotinib others , promote anti-tumor efficacy single agent . Based investigator ' previous experience different HDACi LBH589 preclinical HCC model , strong anti-proliferative pro-apoptotic well anti-angiogenic effect expect combine LBH589 exist sorafenib treatment . It assume combination prolong overall survival time-to-progression lower adverse effect HCC patient .</brief_summary>
