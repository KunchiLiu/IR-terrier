	<brief_summary>Theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TBS ) type repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) method reduces excitability small region brain le one hour . Since dystonia spasticity may associate increased excitability motor cortex , expect reduce excitability motor cortex TBS temporarily improve symptom hopefully open avenue future use TBS new , non-invasive therapeutic intervention aid physical therapy symptom amelioration dystonia spasticity . We test motor improvement hour immediately follow TBS use test muscle function quality limb movement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Testing occur three identical visit , escalate stimulation intensity visit . Initial screening perform telephone clinic final screening perform informed consent sign start first study visit . Initial set-up calibration magnetic stimulation device require 10-20 minute . Theta-burst stimulation require 40 second . Hand arm function test immediately one hour follow TBS . Therefore , visit occupy 90-120 minute . Each visit least 2 day previous visit telephone call place one week third visit . Testing limb function perform accord standard clinical rating scale , include modify Ashworth spasticity scale Barry-Albright Dystonia rating scale . Electrophysiological test hand function involve move finger muscle resistance surface electromyographic signal ( EMG ) monitor ability activate one finger time minimize muscle co-contraction overflow . Testing arm function involve measurement ability relax biceps triceps resistance elbow passive movement examiner . Testing cortical function occur theta-burst stimulation , involve standard protocol use suprathreshold single paired-pulse magnetic stimulation measurement induce motor evoke potential ( MEP ) hand arm muscle . The rest MEP threshold input-output curve measure first dorsal interosseus muscle . Paired-pulse inhibition MEP test use subthreshold pulse ( 80 % rest motor threshold ) follow suprathreshold pulse 2.5msec interval . Paired-pulse facilitation test use 12msec interval . Silent period duration response pulse 120 % rest motor threshold measure . Theta-burst stimulation perform accord standard protocol develop Rothwell co-worker NIH European consortium safety guideline stringently enforce . Active motor threshold rest motor threshold determine single-pulse stimulation monitoring electromyographic ( EMG ) activity first dorsal interosseus ( FDI ) muscle accord standard publish protocol use commercially available surface EMG electrode ( DelSys Inc. ) . Stimulation perform use commercially-available Magstim Rapid 2 ( Magstim , Inc. , Wales UK ) standard figure-eight coil hold member research team . Biphasic stimulation pulse give accord standard include driver software . Single pulse , pair pulse , theta-burst rapid stimulation protocol directly available standard user option device . Threshold determination stimulation location perform use subject 's affected hand , non-dominant hand hand affect . The location low threshold stimulation FDI determine gradual movement stimulation coil surface contralateral scalp , region standard `` C3 '' `` C4 '' electrode position ( determined international 10-20 EEG electrode placement convention ) . The handle stimulation coil point backward 45 degree sagittal plane approximately perpendicular rolandic fissure . The location minimum threshold mark washable non-permanent marker subject 's scalp order ensure consistency stimulation . For assessment active motor threshold , subject ask contract FDI muscle resistance give biofeedback maintain average integrate EMG 20 % maximal voluntary isometric EMG . For assessment rest motor threshold , EMG FDI must less 5 % maximal prior stimulation . Single-pulses increase intensity use determine intensity 5 10 pulse evoke EMG response great 200mV ( active threshold ) 50mV ( rest threshold ) baseline . ( Active motor threshold virtually always less resting motor threshold . If case subject , stimulation adjust intensity never exceed 80 % rest motor threshold . ) Thresholds assess theta-burst stimulation , threshold use cortical excitability test describe . Stimulation intensity theta burst set 60 % active motor threshold ( visit 1 ) , 80 % active motor threshold ( visit 2 ) , 80 % rest motor threshold ( visit 3 ) . All stimulation subthreshold , thus expect produce muscle activity . To ensure case , muscle activity continuously monitor FDI stimulation abort muscle activity TBS detect . Set-up theta-burst stimulation involve Magstim Rapid 2 device handle stimulation coil ( standard figure-eight coil ) point backward 45 degree sagittal plane approximately perpendicular rolandic fissure . We use continuous ( cTBS ) pattern delivery magnetic stimulation pulse occur set three 20msec interval ( 50hz burst rate ) , burst three pulse separate 200msec ( 5hz inter-burst rate ) . Thus 15 pulse per second , divide 5 burst three pulse . Each burst three pulse . Stimulation continue 40 second , total 600 pulse . The subject instruct maintain muscle relax , relaxation relevant stimulation monitor use EMG FDI muscle . After initial TBS treatment , single paired-pulse magnetic stimulation perform test cortical function MEP threshold . These pulse apply manner TBS treatment ( describe previous paragraph ) . The stimulation pulse produce loud clicking noise , subject provide earplugs sound isolate ear cuff sound intensity become uncomfortable exceeds normal speech volume .</detailed_description>
