	<detailed_description>When pregnant patient diagnose physician risk VTE , enter perinatology practice previously-prescribed prophylactic enoxaparin regimen , offer chance discus participation study . The patient consent already receive enoxaparin prescribe one two dosing regimen , physician 's discretion , clinic visit . A baseline blood sample drawn ass coagulation use thromboelastography [ TEG ] . TEG point-of-care device measure viscoelastic property clot formation . This device provide rapid detailed information coagulation change . TEG use assess coagulation change commence treatment enoxaparin ( see later ) . As per routine care , patient instruct clinic nurse fill prescription pharmacy , give injection subcutaneously daily morning , troubleshoot injection process . As per routine care , patient opportunity ask question necessary process , understand ability comply injection procedure assess clinic RN . The patient give new prescription need physician regularly schedule MD appointment . At time , per routine care , patient opportunity review troubleshoot injection process RN MD clinic . At clinic visit , per routine care , approximately 1-2 time per month per routine care , patient weigh weight record prenatal chart . At visit patient also ask series question per study flowsheet chart , potential side effect adverse event may experience since last visit . In addition , receive phone call one study investigator twice per month enquire side effect , medication tolerability , medication compliance . At 3 predetermined interval throughout pregnancy , patient instruct give blood sample outpatient laboratory . When possible , blood draw coordinate coincide patient 's regularly schedule prenatal care blood draw , minimize venipuncture episode . The study blood sample result test : anti-Xa level , marker effective prophylactic range Enoxaparin , serum creatinine , marker kidney function renal clearance medication , also coagulation analysis ( use TEG ) ass coagulation effect enoxaparin . TEG point-of-care device measure viscoelastic property clot formation . This device provide rapid detailed information coagulation change . The anti-XA level sample result blind medical care provider patient , use research purpose . At shortly patient reach 36 week gestation , switch enoxaparin unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) , per standard care avoid potentially unexpected bleed event associate onset labor term . When patient come hospital Labor Delivery , routine labor delivery care ensue discretion medical care team . 24 hour delivery , discretion medical care team , patient restart Enoxaparin dose arm , per standard care . She instruct continue enoxaparin 6 week , receive prescription in-hospital provider . The patient return 6 week follow-up visit clinic per standard care , final study blood draw perform time . If patient miss 6 week appointment , receive phone call reschedule per standard care , instruct phone discontinue Enoxaparin come blood draw .</detailed_description>
