	<detailed_description>This study design randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate safety tolerability escalate multiple dos ToleroMune Ragweed subject document history allergic rhinoconjunctivitis exposure ragweed pollen . The efficacy ToleroMune Ragweed also explore subject use LPSR , EPSR , CPT level ragweed specific IgE . A single centre initiate first , second centre include backup , need , enable recruitment number meet . The study consist 3 study period . In Period 1 , Screening perform maximum 8 week randomisation may consist one two visit clinic , Investigator 's discretion . Baseline Challenge consist single visit 1 4 week randomisation . Period 2 ( Treatment Period ) consist 4 visit ( Visits 3A-3D ) two week apart ( 14±2 day ) . Subjects comply inclusion/exclusion criterion assign one 5 dose group . The first dose group receive 4 administration ToleroMune Ragweed . Successive dose group increase dos give 4 administration ToleroMune Ragweed , provide first administration previous dose safe well tolerate .
