	<brief_title>Study DDT Loss Clinically-Recognized Pregnancies South Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , primary goal examine relationship DDT ( dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ) level odds loss clinically-recognized pregnancy amongst woman Limpopo , South Africa . The initial protocol ( referred Part 1 ) plan enroll 2,400 non-pregnant woman , draw blood measurement DDT exposure , follow 1,200 pregnant participant ascertain occurrence miscarriage . An initial two-year pilot 850 non-pregnant woman propose evaluate field procedure , recruitment strategy reproducibility DDT level . Of 444 woman enrol first 10 month pilot Part 1 , 27 become pregnant . Although field procedure well execute , number pregnancy low . Based upon experience date , approach take far unlikely generate enough pregnancy monitor occurrence miscarriage . Therefore , revise protocol ( referred Part 2 ) modify enrollment criterion include pregnant woman early stage pregnancy , confirm rise human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) blood level take 1 week apart pregnant woman pregnancy loss within 4 week enrollment . Participants enrol Part 1 pilot , still pregnant implementation Part 2 withdrawn study , pregnant participant Part 1 continue follow . In Part 2 , total 2,400 pregnant woman enrol . Only meet follow-up criterion ( n=1,200 ) follow determine outcome pregnancy . The reproducibility study DDT level amongst subset 200 woman also drop replace analysis use specimen collect Part 1 .</detailed_description>
