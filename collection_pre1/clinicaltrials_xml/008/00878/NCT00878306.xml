	<brief_title>Disulfiram Interactions With HIV Medications : Clinical Implications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocaine alcohol abuse strongly link HIV infection transmission virus . Disulfiram long approve US FDA treatment alcohol recent data show effective reduce cocaine abuse . Disulfiram antiretroviral medication ( ARV ) metabolize cytochrome P450 3A concomitant use drug could potentially produce adverse drug interaction underscore need identify understand clinical implication drug interaction order effectively treat individual HIV disease cocaine and/or alcohol use disorder . This accomplish conduct study aim identify whether pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic drug interaction importance occur disulfiram medication frequently utilized HIV/AIDS . Abuse cocaine and/or alcohol show significant risk factor HIV infection result high risk sexual drug use behavior occur context use substance . Those HIV infection untreated cocaine and/or alcohol dependence also high risk transmit HIV others . Moreover , HIV disease substance dependence often experience poor clinical outcome result nonadherence HIV treatment regimen . Disulfiram ( DIS ) inhibitor ALDH report alter hepatic cytochrome P450 enzyme function important metabolism many drug frequently use treatment HIV/AIDS . Although approved treatment alcohol dependence , DIS study treatment cocaine addiction recent year . DIS standard 250 mg daily dose associate significant reduction cocaine use well alcohol use history concomitant cocaine-alcohol abuse . DIS 250 mg daily show significant pharmacokinetic interaction cocaine result delayed cocaine clearance . In order fully access possible use DIS treatment cocaine and/or alcohol dependence population , important determine excess risk convey result drug interaction might occur DIS ARV medication . This study use standard clinical pharmacology study design use within-subject design examine two drug interaction study DIS ( 250 mg daily ) follow medication : 1 . Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor , efavirenz 600 mg daily 10 day 2 . Protease inhibitor atazanavir 400 mg daily 8 day ritonavir 200 mg daily 8 day Additional data collect analyzed include : 3 . Clinical data effect medication alone combination cardiac conduction , hepatic function , serum lipid obtain 4 . The safety co-administration alcohol contain HIV preparation ( ritonavir ) DIS determine 5 . The effect ARV DIS function determine ALDH activity DIS metabolite concentration determine use control sample within-subject design ( DIS dose 62.5 mg 250 mg daily ) subject design .</detailed_description>
