	<brief_summary>With one million operation year , cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass one common major surgical procedure worldwide ( 1 ) . Acute kidney injury common serious postoperative complication cardiopulmonary bypass may affect 25 % 50 % patient ( 2-4 ) . Acute kidney injury carry significant cost ( 4 ) independently associate increased morbidity mortality ( 2,3 ) . Even minimal increment plasma creatinine associate increase mortality ( 5,6 ) . Multiple cause cardiopulmonary bypass-associated acute kidney injury propose , include ischemia-reperfusion , generation reactive oxygen specie , hemolysis activation inflammatory pathway ( 7-10 ) . To date , simple , safe effective intervention prevent cardiopulmonary bypass-associated acute kidney injury broad patient population find ( 11-14 ) . Urinary acidity may enhance generation toxicity reactive oxygen specie induce cardiopulmonary bypass ( 10,15 ) . Activation complement cardiac surgery ( 16 ) may also participate kidney injury . Urinary alkalinization may protect kidney injury induce oxidant substance , iron-mediated free radical pathway , complement activation tubular hemoglobin cast formation ( 9,17,18 ) . Of note , increase urinary pH - combination N-acetylcysteine ( 19,20 ) without ( 21 ) - recently report attenuate acute kidney injury patient undergo contrast-media infusion . In pilot double-blind , randomize controlled trial investigator find sodium bicarbonate efficacious , safe , inexpensive easy administer . These finding need confirm refuted clinical investigation geographic institutional setting . Accordingly , investigator hypothesize urinary alkalinization might protect kidney function patient increase risk acute kidney injury undergo cardiopulmonary bypass need confirm international multicenter , double-blind , randomize control trial intravenous sodium bicarbonate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Renal impairment follow cardiopulmonary bypass common . While patient require either short long term renal replacement , mortality patient acute renal failure substantially great develop renal dysfunction . In pilot double-blind , randomize control trial find sodium bicarbonate efficacious , safe , inexpensive easy administer . These finding need confirm refuted clinical investigation geographic institutional setting . There evidence sodium bicarbonate affect cardiovascular , respiratory immune system may benefit patient undergo cardiac surgery . Study Design - overview rationale Patients randomise receive sodium bicarbonate induction anaesthesia 24 hour postoperatively , placebo ( sodium chloride ) . Serum creatinine commonly use clinical indicator renal function along urine output . Both measure several day postoperatively - time period renal impairment likely develop . Randomisation The randomisation base random number generate computer . Once consent obtain , allocation either treatment sodium bicarbonate placebo organise independent person ( clinical trial pharmacist ) dispense cod blind infusion bag ( shrink-wrapped extra black plastic bag ) . This delivered anaesthetic staff look patient theatre , ICU nurse care patient postoperatively . 20 ml sample heparinised blood urine take arterial line urine catheter . Samples take immediately preoperative insertion arterial/urine catheter , 6 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 120 hour commencement cardiopulmonary bypass . Immediately follow collection , preoperative , 6 24 hour blood urine centrifuge low speed separate plasma cellular component . Urine plasma store aliquot -70 degree prior batch analysis . The following variable obtain : Code patient , gender age . Date time admission ICU Operative procedure date time cardiopulmonary bypass Preoperative assessment leave ventricular function , Comorbidities , Pre- , intra- post-operative medication , Markers renal function describe , Doses frusemide administer ( rate frusemide infusion ) Use inotropes vasopressor Cardiac output whenever measure clinical purpose first 24 hour postoperatively Requirement renal replacement therapy Urine output 6 hour period presence urine catheter Acid base status electrolytes baseline , 6 24 hour commencement cardiopulmonary bypass , Time intubation extubation , Date time arrival discharge ICU hospital , death Resources require The principle study discuss involved cardiac anaesthetist , cardiac surgeon , intensivists intensive care nurse , offer co-operation . ICU research nurse allocate patient collect clinical data . Pharmacy require prepare drug placebo infusion bag . Clinical pathology require perform 24 hour creatinine clearance estimation ( addition test clinically indicate ) Protocol violation All protocol violation record . It decide whether nature violation patient exclude primary data analysis . Such evaluation blind treatment . Withdrawal The treat clinician right withdraw patient study believe continued participation jeopardise patient 's well . Ethical Issues Sodium bicarbonate use study consider safe demonstrate widespread clinical use management critically ill patient metabolic acidosis . We consider potential benefit treatment theoretically significant . Given balance benefit risk , consider ethical proceed seek inform consent . Indemnity This investigator-initiated study , accordingly , commercial sponsor 's indemnity provide . Informed consent obtain patient prior operation one investigator ICU research nurse . The clinical care patient consent reason affect .</detailed_description>
