	<brief_summary>This clinical trial evaluate ease conduct randomized trial patient severe head injury care paramedic hospital setting . The trial compare two different kind fluid commonly use elevate blood pressure minimize impact brain injury . The two solution salt solution different concentration . One normal saline solution similar consistency human blood high concentration mixed sugar help keep solution blood stream longer . This study conduct without patient consent time study enrolment . The study report whether trial feasible hospital set launch large definitive trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Trial Traumatic Brain Injured Patients Randomized Prehospital Setting Either Hypertonic Saline Dextran Versus Normal Saline</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Toronto Prehospital Hypertonic Resuscitation-Head Injury Multi Organ Dysfunction Trial ( TOPHR HIT ) randomize , placebo-controlled hospital trial blunt trauma patient head injury . The study compare group receive normal saline accord paramedic 's protocol , treatment group receive single dose 250 ml 7.5 % hypertonic saline 6 % dextran 70 ( RescueFlow BioPhausia AB , Stockholm Sweden ) . The primary objective study report feasibility accordance methodology describe Lancaster Dodds* , specifically address : 1. baseline survival rate treatment control group aid design definitive multicentre trial . 2. randomization compliance rate . 3. ease protocol implementation out-of-hospital setting . 4. adverse rate HSD infusion . The secondary objective include measure effect HSD modulate immuno-inflammatory response severe head injury effect modulate release neuro-biomarkers serum ; evaluate role serum neuro-biomarkers predict patient outcome clinical response HSD intervention ; evaluate effect HSD brain atrophy post-injury neurocognitive neuropsychological outcome . *Lancaster , G.A. , S.
