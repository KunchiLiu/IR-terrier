	<brief_title>Therapeutic Hypothermia Improve Survival After Cardiac Arrest Pediatric Patients-THAPCA-OH Out Hospital Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest occur heart suddenly stop beat blood flow body halt . It occur people hospital medical condition , people hospital result accident cause . Cardiac arrest serious event associate high rate death long-term disability . When person experience cardiac arrest , insufficient amount blood flow oxygen result brain injury . Therapeutic hypothermia therapy involve control lower body temperature maintenance low temperature period time . The treatment may result reduce brain injury . Therapeutic hypothermia successfully use adult experience cardiac arrest improve survival rate health outcome , also study newborn infant suffer perinatal asphyxia . The purpose study evaluate efficacy therapeutic hypothermia improve survival rate reduce brain injury infant child experience cardiac arrest hospital . Study researcher conduct study collaboration follow two pediatric clinical research network : Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network ( PECARN ) , fund Emergency Medical Services Children ( EMSC ) program , National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network ( CPCCRN ) . The study enroll infant child suffer cardiac arrest hospital . Randomization must occur within 6 hour return spontaneous circulation . Participants randomly assign receive either therapeutic hypothermia therapeutic normothermia . Participants receive therapeutic hypothermia body temperature reduce 32 34° Celsius ( C ) remain temperature 2 day . Their body temperature slowly increase normal temperature 36 37.5° C , maintain 5 day cardiac arrest . Participants receive therapeutic normothermia normal temperature maintain 36 37.5° C 5 day cardiac arrest . Special temperature control blanket place maintain body temperature assign range . After 5 day , participant 's temperature manage medical care team . While participant hospital , undergo frequent blood urine collection , chest x-ray , temperature measurement ; parent participant complete questionnaire . When participant ready leave hospital , study researcher perform physical functional assessment . Twenty-eight day cardiac arrest , researcher contact parent participant gather information participant ' health medical condition . At Months 3 12 , child development expert contact parent gather medical information . At Month 12 , participant attend study visit neurologic examination test psychologist trained rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
