	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial test effectiveness safety new anti-diabetes drug ( Cyclo-Z ) prevention treatment Type 2 diabetes . This study determine dose-dependent efficacy safety new drug treatment human diabetes . The Food Drug Administration grant approval use investigational product use study [ FDA approval ( Investigational New Drug ) IND # : 61,897 ] . This new drug think work increase amount zinc body , turn improve sugar metabolism . If study successfully prove Cyclo-Z effective treatment diabetes without significant side effect , large , multi-center study diabetic patient perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development A Novel Anti-Hyperglycemic Agent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We demonstrate cyclic dipeptide Cyclo ( his-pro ) plus zinc ( Cyclo-Z ) treatment improved clinical condition diabetes various animal model phase 1 clinical trial . The main objective study demonstrate product safe effective treatment human diabetes . Research Plan This randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled , parallel study . In study , recruit 120 hypoglycemic drug na type 2 diabetic patient randomize 4 group 30 subject compare effect Cyclo-Z capsule contain Cyclo-His Pro ( CHP ) 0 ( placebo ) , 3 mg ( minimally effective ) , 9 mg ( optimally effective ) , 15 mg ( no-additional effect ) plus 20 mg zinc diabetic symptom 12-week trial period . The primary outcome study improvement hemoglobin A1c ; secondary outcome fast blood glucose , 2 hour postprandial glucose glucose tolerance test . Safety assess presence severe adverse event ( SAEs ) , adverse event ( AEs ) , change vital sign , physical exam , blood hematology , chemistry , liver , renal , thyroid function test , urine analysis zinc , copper level . Clinical Significance The propose study direct impact veteran 's healthcare service . The applicant obtain two type US international patent approval prevent treat human diabetes obesity Cyclo-Z . One patent application Alzheimer 's disease treatment approve . These patent right assign DVA . Based background study observation anticipate propose Phase 2a clinical trial prove Cyclo-Z treatment safe effective treatment human diabetes able present new class anti-diabetes drug improve healthcare VA diabetic patient general public .</detailed_description>
