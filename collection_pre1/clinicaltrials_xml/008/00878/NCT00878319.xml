	<brief_summary>The purpose research study compare two different way treat broken arm ( fractured humerus ) use either , nonoperative approach operative , open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) . The study examine treatment overall give good result regard shoulder elbow function , residual pain deformity . Patients agree consent participation study randomly select receive one two treatment method : 1 . Nonoperative : This method require application plaster sugartong splint 10 - 14 day follow transition functional ( coaptation ) brace worn 4-6 week . Patients follow physiotherapy baseline visit 2 week . 2 . Operative : This treatment option involve operative procedure fixation broken bone plate screw ( open reduction internal fixation - ORIF ) . With method treatment , splint sling worn comfort postoperatively . The patient follow physiotherapy post-operative visit 2 week . Standard follow-up clinic visit 2 week , 6 week , 4 month , 6 month 12 month arrange date randomization . The patient ask complete two questionnaire , report level wellbeing physical function . These questionnaire give patient time baseline visit 2 week 6 week , 4 month , 6 month 12 month . They take approximately 10 - 20 minute complete . At appointment , patient x-rayed healing occur , examine evaluate ( Constant Shoulder Score ) surgeon follow physiotherapy gentle range motion ( ROM ) exercise progress strengthen proprioception elbow shoulder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Operative Nonoperative Treatment Humeral Shaft Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fractures humeral diaphysis occur bimodal distribution represent 3-5 % fracture . Overall incidence high woman typically present advance age population , render fixation difficult due osteoporosis . The majority fracture humeral diaphysis occur mid-shaft proximal third majority simple ( non-comminuted ) pattern . Presently , standard treatment isolated humeral diaphysis fracture nonoperative care use splint , brace , cast sling . Most centre North America Europe favor functional bracing coaptation splint give positive result report device , despite prolonged period pain discomfort well need repeat clinic follow-up visit associate . Presently publish prospective comparative study systematically evaluate patient function follow operative nonoperative treatment humeral shaft fracture . Clinical evaluation follow functional brace use patient-based outcome tool reveal 20 % nonunion rate patient suffer simple ( non-comminuted ) fracture . Invariably , lead surgical intervention achieve union . In whose fracture heal splint , 50 % report full recovery none require surgery nonunion . This low rate functional recovery may due part high rate shoulder stiffness follow functional bracing . Significant stiffness shoulder follow functional brace range 14-60 % average 40 % . The advantage open reduction plate fixation humeral shaft fracture include direct approach fracture site direct visualization protection radial nerve ( depend fracture level approach ) , possibility rigid compressive fixation , opportunity bone graft and/or radial nerve exploration need . Importantly , permit rapid mobilization shoulder elbow , obviate need immobilization , ensure anatomic near anatomic alignment . These advantage must weigh small risk infection ( &lt; 1-6 % ) occur open fracture severe crush injury , nonunion ( 4-6 % ) especially high energy injury , iatrogenic radial nerve injury ( 1-3 % ) vast majority transient . Operative care : Fixation regular broad 3.5mm 4.5mm dynamic compression plate ( DCP ) use standard technique apply case normal bone density ; face osteopenic bone , locked-plate implant employ discretion surgeon . Bone graft use routinely simple fracture pattern . Postoperative splinting ( sling ) maintain 10 - 14 day follow gentle ROM exercise physiotherapy supervision . Strengthening proprioception begin fracture heal occur , typically 6-8 week . Conservative care entail application plaster sugartong splint 10-14 day follow transition functional ( coaptation ) brace , apply qualified orthotist . Gentle ROM exercise elbow shoulder begin tolerate supervision physiotherapist 2 week strengthen proprioception add fracture healing occur , typically 6-8 week . This multicentre prospective randomize trial involve Canadian Orthopaedic Trauma Society ( COTS ) , association trauma surgeon involve collaborative outcome research proven track record research publication . Patients humeral diaphyseal fracture meet eligibility criterion provide consent participate randomly assign operative splint/brace treatment group . Patients start physiotherapy 2 week post-randomization ( splint/brace group ) 2 week post-surgery gentle ROM exercise . The operative group progress strengthen proprioception 4-6 week . The splint/brace group progress 6-8 week mark union occur . Evaluation 2 6 week , 4 , 6 , 12 month include functional , clinical radiological parameter . Functional evaluation include DASH , SMFA questionnaires Constant Shoulder Score . Clinical outcome evaluate range motion include shoulder elbow affect arm contralateral shoulder elbow . Standard radiographic parameter measure . The primary outcome measure functional outcome measure DASH . Appropriate statistical analysis perform data . Sample size calculation reveals need 90 patient per treatment arm . A census center commit study predicts 1-24 month recruitment period . Patient follow-up end 12 month visit .</detailed_description>
