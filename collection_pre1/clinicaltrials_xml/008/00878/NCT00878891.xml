	<brief_summary>An increase risk adverse outcome note diabetic patient admit surgery intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Tight glycemic control intensive insulin therapy dramatically reduce in-hospital mortality adverse outcome . Devices record continuously interstitial glucose monitoring ( CGM ) may aid patient ICU normoglycemia become target . The mini-invasive device ( Glucoday® ) provide real-time glucose concentration order quickly adjust insulin infusion rate . The objective MARGE study compare percent time normoglycemia base conventional monitoring ( discontinuous glucose monitor ) Glucoday conventional monitoring alone . The MARGE study multicenter ( 2 center ) , randomize , single blind trial . Several study show hyperglycemia associate poor outcome hospitalize patient . Postoperative glucose level significant predictor infection rate cardiac surgery death rate . Based observational study , randomize control intervention trial surgical ICU patient demonstrate intensive insulin therapy reduce overall in-hospital mortality 34 % stream infection 46 % . Using continuous glycemic monitoring ( CGM ) show intensive insulin therapy base discontinuous glucose monitoring reveal normoglycemia achieve 22 % time . The researcher ' aim determine real time CGM new generation mini invasive device , Glucoday® S , would allow quickly adjust insulin infusion rate accord interstitial glucose level decrease hyperglycemic hypoglycemic excursion . This study investigate whether application real time CGM titrate insulin therapy target glycemia tight range ( 80-110 mg/dl ) improve diabetic patient outcome coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetes major independent risk factor coronary disease . Coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) significantly improve patient ' prognostic . However postoperative hyperglycemia morbidity mortality factor . Tight glycemic control intensive insulin therapy dramatically reduce in-hospital mortality adverse outcome significant risk hypoglycaemia . Intensive discontinuous blood glucose control may insufficient adapt insulin dose reach ambitious glycemia target safety . Therefore new tool need glucose monitoring diabetic patient admit surgery intensive care unit ( ICU ) . The mini-invasive continuous interstitial glucose monitoring device Glucoday® ( Menarini Diagnostics ) recently develop allows access continuous interstitial glucose monitor real time record display . The primary outcome measure : Comparison post CABG glycemia diabetic patient treat intensive insulin therapy either conventional monitoring ( discontinuous capillary glucose monitoring ) , conventional monitoring CGM use GlucoDay® . The principal criterion glycemic control percent time spend normoglycemia ( 0.8 - 1.10 g/L ) . The secondary outcome measure : 1 : Comparison percent post CABG time hyperglycemia ( &gt; 1.8 g/l ) hypoglycemia ( &lt; 0.5 g/l ) two randomization group . 2 : Comparison clinical outcome incidence 30 day CABG : death rate , cardiovascular event ( acute coronary syndrome , heart failure , arrhythmia ) stream infection , neurologic event . 3 : Comparison performance accuracy CGM Glucoday® conventional capillary blood glucose monitoring set CABG surgical ICU . 4 : Comparison duration stay ICU surgical care unit . 5 : Description device care tolerance collection adverse event due device hospitalization Study design : It 's efficacy multi-center randomized clinical trial parallel assignment . The principal analysis perform patient difference clinically significant , perform sub-groups . Inclusion criteria Patients age 20 80 year , patient admit CABG , patient Known type 1 type 2 diabetes , patient Type 2 diabetes discover surgical anaesthetic pre-operative consultation ( plasmatic glycemia &gt; 1.26 g/l ) need dietary guideline , Patients affiliate French Social Security inform consent sign Exclusion criterion patient type cardiac surgery CABG , Patients admit emergency , Pregnancy breastfeed woman , Patients include clinical trial exclusion period still run , Patients safeguard justice Study procedure : - Arm 1. conventional glucose monitoring ( discontinuous glucose monitor ) - Arm 2. conventional glucose monitoring + GlucoDay® ( continuous glycemic monitoring ) Primary efficacy end-points : percent time spend normoglycemia ( 0.80-1.10 g/l ) end surgical intervention 48 hour first device calibration ( perform intervention ) Principal secondary efficacy end-points : 1 : percent time hyperglycemia ( &gt; 1.8 g/l ) hypoglycaemia ( &lt; 0.5g/l ) time intervention 48 hour first device calibration . 2 : composite criterion evaluate one month inclusion : death cardiovascular event event ( acute coronary syndrome , heart failure , arrhythmia ) stream infection , neurologic event . 3 : agreement CGM Glucoday® conventional capillary blood glucose monitor use couple data record time except couple data correspond calibration time ( T0 , T24H ) . 4 : duration stay hospital two randomization group . 5 : device care tolerance collection adverse event due device hospitalization . The enrollment : 154 patient , 77 group Flow chart : At screen visit , patient inform study , eligibility criterion verify standard laboratory analysis perform . At inclusion visit ( one day surgical intervention ) , eligibility criterion verify , informed consent sign , standard laboratory analysis , clinical exam randomization perform . At day 0 , The CABG perform patient transfer ICU Glucoday® instal . At day 2 ( 48 hour ) Glucoday® remove . At day 7 , clinical exam perform . Between CABG day 30 event collect .</detailed_description>
