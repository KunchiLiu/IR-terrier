	<brief_summary>It still uncertain best treatment patient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) heart failure . The aim study help identify optimal treatment patient two significant medical condition . This perform compare two alternative strategy AF management : catheter ablation ( restore normal rhythm ) medical therapy ( control heart rate , aim ro restore normal rhythm ) . After random assignment , effect strategy assess look change exercise capacity , symptom , heart pump function , quality life 12 month follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catheter Ablation Versus Medical Rate Control Atrial Fibrillation Patients With Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently available evidence suggest occurrence AF patient heart failure ( HF ) lead decline exercise tolerance , worsen quality life , increased hospitalisation , many study increase mortality . These may explain haemodynamic effect AF i.e . reduction functional cardiac output due inappropriate heart rate , irregularity , loss atrial contraction , plus risk thromboembolism . Evidence large clinical study show patient heart failure fare well sinus rhythm restore , contrary 'rhythm control ' strategy ( intention treat ) cardioversion antiarrhythmic drug achieve sinus rhythm show superior strategy rate control . These apparently contradictory finding might explain poor efficacy side effect associate current rhythm control strategy , could reflect AF merely passive marker underlie disease severity . However , many study would point former , might hypothesise theoretical benefit sinus rhythm could see real clinical practice superior rhythm-control strategy use . Catheter ablation , relatively new treatment atrial fibrillation , show feasible non-randomised heart failure patient cohort , marker suggest improvement cardiac function . This prospective clinical trial enrol HF patient optimal therapy , document persistent AF , compare strategy catheter-ablation medical rate control 1:1 randomised fashion .</detailed_description>
