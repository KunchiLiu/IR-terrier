	<brief_title>Effect Dietary Life Style Modification Post Liver Transplant Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design interventional , prospective , randomize , case-control clinical trial . Procedures do Starzl Transplant Institute Center Liver disease , Kaufmann building , UPMC . Subjects select participate study , adult liver transplant recipients undergone one liver transplantation 6 month time inclusion . They must able communicate English ( able independently follow directive record activity recall diary ) . Patients exclude study 18 year old , refuse give write consent participate study , receive liver graft 6 month time inclusion , psychological nervous disorder , cardiovascular musculoskeletal health problem interfere basic physical activity , manifestation hepatic failure ascites hepatic encephalopathy . Patients remove study develop intolerance dietary physical recommendation ( e.g . remarkable fatigue ) . Verifying eligibility patient participation study do review data medical history , physical examination investigation include patient ' medical record . Complete blood count , liver function test , fast glucose lipid profile , image histopathologic investigation , abdominal imaging , pathology report liver biopsy , stress ECG , echocardiography . These test perform standard care . Subjects randomly group group simple randomization method . One investigator randomly pick one fold paper plastic bag contain folded paper label folded side number group . The first group ( Group 1 ) include control subject . They receive one session dietary behavioral education . The second group ( Group 2 ) interventional group . They receive weight management life style modification program similar previously describe ( Kelley et al . 2004 ) . The program present registered dietitian UPMC '' . It consist 6 weekly session nutritional physical exercise education . These initial session concentrate lifestyle modification program include healthy food selection , emphasize reduce fat consumption ( &lt; =30 % daily calorie ) restriction protein create daily negative energy balance ~500 kcal/day . Participants encourage start 10 minute outdoor home physical activity walk cycle gradually increase activity duration 30 minute daily . The dietitian provide subject diary daily record dietary intake physical activity respectively . Following initial 6-week program patient attend follow session every 6 month 5 year dietary behavioral education check dietary physical activity diary , reinforce encourage compliance dietary physical exercise recommendation , answer question address problem . Patients required attend least 60 % follow session site face face education . Attempts make schedule session day regular clinical follow facilitate compliance . Up 40 % monthly follow session may provide phone patient attend site travel restraint . The dietitian call candidate within day miss appointment check encourage compliance , check change weight . Each session hold 1 hour health education room center liver disease . All session register dietitian . Additional 5 cc blood take routine blood draw do twice first month every 6 month 5 year . The total blood volume withdrawn subject study group 60 cc . Blood spinned , serum bank -80Â° Celsius freezer . These bank serum use future research work aim assess activity inflammatory fibrotic marker tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin 6 , leptin , adiponectin . Stool sample take patient study intervention every 12 week afterwards . Stool sample store -80 degree Celsius freezer future PCR study fecal microflra . Jennifer Steel assess stress study candidate specific questionnaire start intervention study every 12 week afterwards . The following data collect every 6 month follow visit group ; anthropometric index obesity measurement weight , height ( BMI calculation ) , waist circumference , hip circumference , skin fold thickness mid-arm circumference , survival rate , morbidity event cardiovascular cerbrovascular event , diabetes hypertension . For control group , anthropometric measure obtain return routine clinic visit . Midarm circumference triceps skin fold thickness measure near 1 cm , leave arm midway tip acromion tip olecranon . Skinfold thickness measure triceps ( Oppert et al . 2002 ) . Waist circumference measure midway iliac crest low rib margin , hip circumference level great trochanter ( Han et al . 2001 ) . Histological score necro-inflammation ( Ishak score ) steatosis ( Dixon 's scale ) implant liver assess 1 year post transplant . All pathological evaluation do part ( allocate research purpose ) biopsy obtain deem necessary routine care clinical provider ( e.g . 1 year post liver transplant ) conduct pathologist blind experimental protocol . Data compare 2 group Chi square test student test . Assuming rate obesity control group 50 % 50 % reduction obesity incidence interventional group , estimate sample size 58 per group need detect difference 80 % confidence p value &lt; 0.05 . A p &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
