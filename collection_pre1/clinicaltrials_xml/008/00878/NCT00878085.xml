	<brief_summary>The investigator study motor recovery robot-assisted therapy stroke . A small clinical trial conduct quantify central nervous system change associate robotic standard training , identify trend across high low responder term pattern change cortical activity type white matter connectivity.The investigator hypothesize robot train lead large improvement compare standard occupational therapy . The investigator hypothesize high responder robot train reduce compensatory activation bilateral area connectivity motor tract .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Robot-assisted therapy cut edge stroke rehabilitation therapy method promise improve live person disability due stroke . Preliminary study use tool provide mixed evidence effectiveness reveal limitation . For example , inconsistent carryover motor gain real life activity daily live ( ADLs ) see . Therefore , still clear treatment strategy maximize functional outcome ADLs . There need study stroke recovery process understand optimize robot-assisted therapy order enhance patient rehabilitation improve functional outcome . Imaging technique functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) assist u understand stroke recovery process , determine may benefit robot-assisted training , define training induced functional cortical change occur robot training . We propose conduct interventional study plus control assess effectiveness four week robot-assisted practice task skilled functional task involve reach grasp activity similar real activity . We examine process recovery low-to-moderate function stroke survivor chronic disability . We assess ability active-assisted reach grasp train effect immediate gain long-term functional improvement . Further , use fMRI DTI , plan associate change see motor impairment level functional task performance level white matter injury connectivity change oxygen utilization motor cortex well area brain . Our short-term aim , ) ass short-term functional gain practice skilled reach grasp task ; ii ) ass maintenance improvement ; iii ) quantify neuronal change associate short-term gain , iv ) identify trend across high low responder term pattern change cortical activity type white matter connectivity . In long-term , hope improve understanding process ADL functional recovery stroke optimize robot-training strategy lead cerebral plasticity . We also hope determine lesion characteristic affect change see function , white matter connectivity , cortical activity . By , accomplish aim , hope improve upper extremity function stroke reduce disability .</detailed_description>
