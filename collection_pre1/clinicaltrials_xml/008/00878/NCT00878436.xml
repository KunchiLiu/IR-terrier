	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Studies Panobinostat Bicalutamide Patients With Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Castration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The preclinical data indicate Panobinostat restore sensitivity androgen-independent cell bicalutamide ( Casodex® ) combination synergistic inhibitory activity . Here , hypothesize treatment castration-resistant patient Panobinostat enhance response second line hormone therapy bicalutamide ( Casodex® ) . In proposed phase I study , maximum tolerate dose tri-weekly , intermittent oral Panobinostat three different dose level ( 60 , 90 , 120 mg/week ) combination Casodex ( 50mg PO ) determine ; The following phase II study evaluate efficacy 9-month treatment select Panobinostat-Casodex combination also low dose Panobinostat . We expect Casodex-Panobinostat combination treatment castration-resistant patient prevent biochemical and/or metastatic disease progression patient compare historical control time period .</detailed_description>

ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2 Documented history adenocarcinoma prostate . Patients must evidence disease progression receive androgen suppression therapy orchiectomy primary hormonal therapy include , limited ( LHRH agonist therapy ( e.g. , leuprolide goserelin ) LHRH antagonist ( e.g . aberelix ) . Note : patient undergone bilateral orchiectomy must continue LHRH therapy protocol Testosterone must &lt; 50 ng/dl confirm within 4 week prior registration patient LHRH therapy Patients must evidence disease progression either one condition list : Biochemical progression Metastases bone scan Patients may receive one chemotherapy , investigational agent immunotherapy neoadjuvant , adjuvant set initial LHRH therapy new evidence disease progression discontinuation therapy ≥ 2 week . Patients must receive one prior second line hormone therapy progression LHRH treatment orchiectomy . Patients treat one first line chemotherapy combination hormone refractory progression ≥ 4 week prior registration evidence disease progression one second line hormone therapy experience PSA response bicalutamide ( Casodex® ) withdrawal . Prior treatment HDAC inhibitor Impaired cardiac function include one following : Screening ECG QTc &gt; 450 msec confirm central laboratory prior enrollment study Patients congenital long QT syndrome History sustain ventricular tachycardia Any history ventricular fibrillation torsades de pointes Bradycardia define heart rate &lt; 50 beat per minute .
