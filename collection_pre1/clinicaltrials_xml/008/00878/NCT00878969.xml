	<detailed_description>More 400,000 individual chronic kidney disease undergo hemodialysis year United States . Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease lead cause mortality patient . Conventional risk factor coronary artery disease ( CAD ) adequately explain increased mortality , whereas biomarker oxidative stress inflammation correlate clinical outcome . Even use biocompatible membrane , hemodialysis induces systemic inflammatory reaction characterize complement activation , leukocyte activation generation reactive oxygen specie cytokine . Oxidative stress inflammation promote endothelial dysfunction , predictor atherosclerotic cardiovascular event . The purpose study test hypothesis angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition angiotensin receptor blockade differ long term effect biomarkers fibrinolysis , oxidative stress , inflammation carotid intima-media thickness ( IMT ) , predictor cardiovascular event , patient chronic kidney disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis . Endogenous Bradykinin ( BK ) contribute hypotensive pro-fibrinolytic effect ACE inhibitor . It determine endogenous BK contributes vasodilator effect acute chronic ACE inhibition . Studies find BK stimulates vascular tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) release BK B2 receptor-dependent , nitric oxide ( NO ) cyclooxygenase-independent pathway . Hemodialysis patient demonstrate endothelial dysfunction . Data suggest t-PA release may attenuate stimulation endogenous kallikrein-kinin system hemodialysis . Intra-arterial infusion BK increase vascular release F2- isoprostanes , marker oxidative stress , BK infusion also increase net release inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . Preliminary data raise possibility activation endogenous kallikrein-kinin system dialysis could promote inflammation individual chronic kidney disease treat ACE inhibitor . Cardiopulmonary bypass activate endogenous kallikrein-kinin system cause systemic inflammatory response . Like hemodialysis , cardiopulmonary bypass activate endogenous kallikrein-kinin system , increase BK concentration . In smoker , like hemodialysis patient exhibit endothelial dysfunction , t-PA response BK attenuate cardiopulmonary bypass . ACE inhibition enhances fibrinolysis decrease inflammation follow cardiopulmonary bypass . The short-term effect ACE inhibition angiotensin II type 1 ( AT1 ) receptors marker fibrinolysis inflammation dialysis currently study . Circulating BK concentration increase hemodialysis individual treat ACE inhibitor compare treated AT1 receptor blocker . Bradykinin receptor blockade fibrinolytic inflammatory response hemodialysis . It hypothesize subject CAD , t-PA response hemodialysis blunt compare measured subject without evidence CAD , whereas inflammatory response wil similar enhanced .</detailed_description>
