	<brief_summary>In patient present acute dyspnea pre-hospital setting , early correct diagnosis may present significant clinical challenge . Physical examination , chest radiography , electrocardiography , standard biological test often fail accurately differentiate heart failure ( HF ) pulmonary cause dyspnea . Timely differentiation HF cause dyspnea may permit early institution appropriate medical therapy . Brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) propose early marker HF demonstrate useful diagnose exclude HF emergency department . A combination BNP NT-proBNP test standard clinical assessment suggest superior either tool use isolation . Some previous study also suggest quantitative capnometry ( QC ) may useful differentiate cardiac obstructive cause respiratory distress . Therefore , investigator hypothesize new combination NT-proBNP testing , standard clinical assessment , partial pressure end-tidal CO2 ( PetCO2 ) would optimize evaluation differentiation acute dyspnea pre-hospital setting . The aim study determine accuracy combination QC , NT-proBNP , clinical assessment differentiate acute HF obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD/asthma ) cause acute dyspnea pre-hospital emergency setting .</brief_summary>
