	<brief_title>Copeptin Risk Stratification Acute Stroke Patients : CoRisk Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The investigator Prolyse Acute Cerebral Thromboembolism ( PROACT ) II study find intra-arterial thrombolysis ( IAT ) prourokinase within 6 hour onset symptom beneficial patient middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) occlusion . Intra-arterial thrombolysis ( IAT ) thus option treatment select patient major stroke &lt; 6 hour ' duration due occlusion MCA . Recently observational study show IAT beneficial intra-venous thrombolysis ( IVT ) specific group stroke patient present hyperdense middle cerebral artery sign CT , even though IAT start later . However complication reperfusion treatment modality symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage , malignant brain oedema , re-occlusion , infection , seizure may occur . Unfortunately clinical sign provide prognostic information clear risk stratification . The guideline reperfusion therapy Switzerland , Europe US include -for time being- biomarkers decision-making-process . However might powerful biomarkers , serve point care tool risk stratification candidate receive thrombolysis . Plasma copeptin concentration recently show easy determine , steady parameter independently predict functional outcome death patient acute ischemic stroke . Copeptin derive large precursor peptide ( pre-provasopressin ) along two peptide , Vasopressin ( AVP ) neurophysin II . Released equimolar ratio , amount copeptin mirror production AVP . AVP play important role regulation hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , thus , reflect individual stress response . `` Stressors '' stroke strong stimulators release AVP . The close reproducible relation copeptin level degree activation stress axis basis usefulness biomarker . Early prognostic factor predict mortality outcome stroke patient important guide tailor early decision treatment . In context , copeptin may helpful tool early risk stratification stroke patient guide decision reperfusion therapy . Objective To evaluate copeptin prognostic tool predict outcome well-defined cohort stroke patient . Methods Step 1 . All eligible patient emergency department neurological ward evaluate enrollment study . On admission , 2 x 7.5ml- EDTA-blood tube draw first routine blood sampling , 2 x 7.5ml-EDTA-blood tube follow routine blood-sampling . Copeptin level assess blind batch analysis upon completion plasma asservation . Measurement perform new chemiluminescence sandwich immunoassay . Step 2 . All baseline data collect . CT MRI perform 22 36 hour IAT . All complication include death reperfusion therapy assess discharge . Step 3 . A telephone follow-up regard morbidity mortality obtain 3 month . An unfavorable outcome define mRs 3 6</detailed_description>
