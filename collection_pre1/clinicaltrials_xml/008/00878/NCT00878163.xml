	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose erlotinib hydrochloride give together GDC-0449 without gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer solid tumor remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , GDC-0449 gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving GDC-0449 together erlotinib hydrochloride without gemcitabine hydrochloride may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GDC-0449 Erlotinib Hydrochloride With Without Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose erlotinib hydrochloride Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 without gemcitabine hydrochloride patient unresectable solid tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe adverse event profile associate treatment regimen . II . To describe response patient treat regimen . III . To assess effect erlotinib hydrochloride Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 select biomarkers circulate tumor cell tumor biopsy sample patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . IV . To assess effect erlotinib hydrochloride Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography image patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . V. To study association clinical ( toxicity and/or tumor response activity ) biologic ( pharmacodynamic ) result associate erlotinib hydrochloride Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study erlotinib hydrochloride . Patients receive Hedgehog antagonist GDC-0449 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) erlotinib hydrochloride PO QD day 1-28 . Some patient also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients treat maximum tolerated dose undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography baseline day 28 . These patient also undergo tumor tissue blood sample collection baseline periodically study correlative laboratory study . Samples analyze tyrosine phosphorylated total MAP-K , EGFR , AKT , potential biomarkers activity/response level gene transcriptionally activate ( e.g. , BCL-2 , GLI , BFL-1/A1 , 4-1BB , PTC1 ) immunofluorescence , IHC , quantitative-PCR . After completion study therapy , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
