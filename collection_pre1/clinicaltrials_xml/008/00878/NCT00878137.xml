	<brief_summary>The antiphospholipid-antibody syndrome ( APLA ) , include lupus anticoagulant , anticardiolipin , anti-beta-2-glycoproteinI antibody , thrombophilic disorder associate arterial thrombosis , venous thrombosis . Patients diagnose APLA high risk recurrent thrombosis patient without known antibody . Currently , warfarin consider anticoagulant choice prophylactic antithrombotic treatment APLA patient first episode thrombosis . In patient APLA treat warfarin , INR value determine plasma unreliable due influence APLA INR . In individual , alternative monitoring method , factor II activity , chromogenic factor X activity prothrombin-proconvertin time use assess adequate anticoagulation . These test expensive widely available clinician . Point-of-care ( POC ) instrument , hand , readily accessible clinician . Previous research show INR value 3 old point-of-care ( POC ) instrument unreliable 1/3 APLA patient ( CoaguChekTM , ProTimeTM , INRatioTM ) . However , new version POC instrument available ( CoaguChek XSTM , investigational ProTime device , new INRatioTM device ) unknown new POC instrument reliable patient APLA . The purpose study determine whether new POC instrument reliable patient APLA .</brief_summary>
