	<brief_summary>AT13387/0001 dose-finding study experimental anticancer agent . In accordance protocol increase dos AT13387 give patient advanced cancer alternative treatment option . The preferred dose AT13387 identify accord side effect experience different dose level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Escalating Doses AT13387 Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasing dos AT13387 administer group 3 6 patient dose level . The pharmacokinetic profile AT13387 follow one hour intravenous infusion determine effect AT13387 predefined biomarkers blood plasma circulate white blood cell establish . Patients closely monitor development side effect would preclude dose escalation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Provision sign informed consent . Age 18 year old . Histological cytological evidence metastatic solid tumor include lymphoma , refractory standard therapy . The following tumor type particular interest may likely respond HSP90 inhibition effort make recruit patient study diagnosis . Only patient diagnose others think responsive HSP90 inhibitor enrol follow identification MTD . Metastatic breast cancer HER2 positive either FISH 3+ immunohistochemistry staining , Adenocarcinoma prostate refractory treatment androgen depletion , Metastatic melanoma , Stage IIIb IV NSCLC , SCLC , High grade glioma ( patient must stable dose corticosteroid least one week prior treatment AT13387 experience neurological deterioration period ) , GIST . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 . Adequate marrow function define : Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL , Neutrophils &gt; 1.4 x 10^9/L , Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L . Negative serum urine pregnancy test evidence surgical sterility evidence postmenopausal status . Postmenopausal status define follow : natural menopause menses &gt; 1 year ago ; radiation induce oophorectomy last menses &gt; 1 year ago ; chemotherapyinduced menopause 1 year interval since last menses . Be pregnant lactating ( woman childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior enrolment ) . Male female patient childbearing potential must use appropriate birth control ( barrier method , oral contraceptive and/or intrauterine device ) entire duration study , patient must surgically sterile ( documentation patient 's medical record ) . Ongoing central nervous system metastases patient extracranial primary tumor ( unless patient 's neurological sign symptom stable precede three month patient receive corticosteroid treatment four week prior study entry ) . Inadequate liver function demonstrate serum bilirubin &gt; 2.5 time upper limit reference range ( ULRR ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) ≥ 2.5 time ULRR ( unless due presence liver metastases ALT and/or AST may five time upper limit reference range ) . Patients isolated increase ALP ≤ 5 time ULRR absence liver metastases know bone metastasis eligible study . Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50 % echocardiography MUGA scan . Moderate severe renal impairment define serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 ULRR &gt; + proteinuria two occasion less 24 hour apart . Previous treatment HSP90 inhibitor . Anticancer therapy complete least 28 day prior treatment AT13387 ( surgery treatment protein kinase inhibitor must complete less one week prior treatment AT13387 ) . Incomplete recovery previous radiotherapy surgery residual cutaneous effect stable &lt; Grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity . History ischemic cardiac event , myocardial infarction unstable cardiac disease within 3 month study entry . QTc &gt; 460 m accord Fridericia 's correction . Previous malignancy , except nonbasalcell carcinoma skin carcinomainsitu uterine cervix , unless tumor treat curative intent 2 year prior study entry . Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic condition ( e.g. , systemic infection ) current unstable uncompensated respiratory cardiac condition make undesirable patient participate study could jeopardize compliance protocol . Prior history infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , know active hepatitis B C viruses screen viral infection require entry study . Chronic treatment know CYP450 inducer e.g . phenytoin , within four week receive treatment AT13387 ( see Appendix D list ) Dexamethasone patient glioma .</criteria>
