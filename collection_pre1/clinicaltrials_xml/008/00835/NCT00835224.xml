	<brief_summary>After spinal cord injury brain longer completely control body level injury . This affect many organ system body , interested understanding spinal cord injury affect blood pressure blood flow brain . We go study blood pressure person seat wheelchair give subject medication increase blood pressure laboratory set course normal day person spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy L-NAME Midodrine Increase MAP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blood pressure regulation compromise person tetraplegia due de-centralization sympathetic cardiovascular control , associate hypotension upright positioning ( 7 , 10 , 18 , 33 ) . An alpha receptor agonist ( midodrine hydrochloride ) report raise blood pressure person tetraplegia ( 25 , 26 , 30 ) . Midodrine drug presently available treat orthostatic hypotension . In clinical armamentarium , always beneficial agent multiple drug class treat condition . In treatment hypertension , several class drug may prescribe low blood pressure , alone combination . The clinician patient would benefit another class drug , totally separate mechanism action , available treat orthostatic hypotension . A nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ( NOSi ) , nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME ) , show group `` normalize '' blood pressure person tetraplegia ( 32 ) . The safety efficacy two hypertensive agent investigate compare person chronic tetraplegia . Although mechanism action agent appreciate , relative cardiovascular effect person SCI compare control know . The study determine efficacy safety two medication restore mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) daily activity person chronic tetraplegia . Furthermore , implication restore MAP normal level ( 80 10 mmHg ) individual tetraplegia cardiovascular , autonomic , hormonal cognitive function .</detailed_description>
