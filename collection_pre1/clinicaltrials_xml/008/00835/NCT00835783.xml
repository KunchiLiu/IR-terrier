	<brief_summary>The overall aim validate current use FDG PET/CT diagnosis infection inflammation examine usefulness PET/CT applying also tracer . The result allow u confirm primary hypothesis : `` FDG-PET/CT better establish method confirm exclude diagnosis infection/inflammation '' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Study Combined Positron Emission Tomography/Computer Tomography Diagnose Infection Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include several part project , contribute evaluation value FDG-PET/CT diagnosis infection inflammation . The aim establish diagnostic value term sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value , interobserver intraobserver variation . Part project A FDG-PET/CT patient blood culture positive staphylococcus aureus unresolved origin infection . Part project B FDG-PET/CT patient fever unknown origin . Part project C FDG-PET/CT patient suspect vascular graft infection . Additionally , wish establish optimal image protocol ( necessity fasting , consequence antibiotic therapy prior imaging , need contrast ) , interpretation criterion , value standard uptake value ( SUV ) .</detailed_description>
