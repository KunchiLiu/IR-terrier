	<brief_summary>The investigator seek develop clinical prediction rule ( CPR ) identify patient primary complaint shoulder pain likely benefit manual therapy neck upper back region . Manual therapy include mobilization ( therapist move joint oscillate fashion ) manipulation ( therapist performs high velocity low amplitude movement ) The investigator hypothesize cluster sign symptom subject history physical examination exist maximize accuracy identify patient primary complaint shoulder pain likely benefit manual therapy treatment base reference standard patient-reported improvement . The investigator also seek investigate psychometric property ( good test ) , include test retest reliability modify version Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire ( FABQ ) shorten Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia ( TSK-11 ) patient shoulder pain . The investigator also look convergent validity ( determine measure relate reality relate ) discriminant validity ( show measure relate reality relate ) modify FABQ TSK-11 patient shoulder pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The point prevalence shoulder symptom report range 20-33 % incidence shoulder complaint general population increase . Furthermore , several author report low rate perceive recovery ( patient report `` cure '' ) patient new episode shoulder neck pain.3-6 According Bot et al , le 25 % patient first episode shoulder pain report recovery 3 month , 32 % state recover ( longer symptom ) 1 year . Other study investigate prognosis shoulder pain general practice . Croft et al report recovery rate 21 % 6 month 49 % 18 month . Van der Windt et al Winters et al report recovery rate 51 % 59 % 12 18 month , respectively . Finally , Rekola et al report 25 % patient shoulder neck pain experience least one episode recurrence within 12 month . These finding suggest shoulder pain recurrent frequently progress chronic stage . The Guide Physical Therapist Practice describe 5 component patient management ; examination , evaluation , diagnosis , prognosis , intervention outcome . Information collect examination evaluate attempt improve decision make regard appropriate treatment strategy individual patient . Contrary medical model attempt identify pathology arrive diagnosis , diagnostic process physical therapy involve classify label patient base functional limitation ( restriction activity cause certain condition ) impairment ( loss abnormality function decrease strength motion ) attempt specifically direct treatment . Clinical decision make regard treatment involve certain degree uncertainty intervention maximize individual patient outcome . While amount quality evidence support physical therapy intervention increase , uncertainty make difficult decide appropriate treatment strategy . The American Physical Therapy Association state identify subgroup patient likely benefit specific treatment research priority . ( APTA ) The Guide Physical Therapist Practice indicate intervention mobilization/manipulation utilized physical therapist manage patient shoulder pain . There grow evidence impairment cervicothoracic spine may contribute shoulder pain , patient shoulder pain may benefit manipulation region . Manipulation define manual therapy technique comprise continuum skilled passive movement , include small-amplitude/high velocity movement ( thrust ) oscillation ( non-thrust ) , target joint soft tissue . While likely patient shoulder pain benefit manipulation ( thrust non-thrust ) cervicothoracic spine , possible subgroup exist experience rapid dramatic improvement use manual physical therapy technique . It specific aim develop clinical prediction rule ( CPR ) identify patient primary complaint shoulder pain likely benefit cervicothoracic manipulation . The purpose CPR improve clinician 's accuracy predict diagnosis expect outcome . For example , CPRs exist improve accuracy diagnose ankle fracture individual acute injury , predict likelihood death within four year individual coronary disease , determine cervical radiograph require patient experience neck trauma . The process develop test CPR describe detail elsewhere . Although CPRs develop improve accuracy make certain diagnosis , focus project develop CPR predict certain treatment outcome . The development CPR utilize diagnostic property sensitivity , specificity , positive negative likelihood ratio , base individual patient . Thus interpretation readily apply individual patient . Development CPR accurately predict patient shoulder pain likely experience clinically meaningful improvement pain function cervicothoracic spine manipulation treatment would immensely helpful clinician decision-making process . Thus purpose project develop CPR identify patient shoulder pain likely benefit cervicothoracic spine thrust non-thrust manipulation .</detailed_description>
