	<brief_title>The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Fish Oil Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease abbreviate COPD include emphysema chronic bronchitis . COPD currently fourth lead cause death United States . Unlike major medical disease , morbidity mortality COPD continue rise US . In 2000 , 10 million Americans carry physician diagnosis COPD 120,000 Americans die disease . Additionally , year 1980 year 2000 , number case COPD among woman nearly double prevalence among African Americans increase 61 % . Unlike lead cause death , medical therapy currently available improve course disease affect survival COPD . Current therapies COPD improve survival COPD limit smoke cessation , oxygen therapy , possibly surgery . Medical therapy inhaler pill improve symptom reduce COPD exacerbation ( `` attack '' ) , show slow progression disease . Recent investigation suggest endothelial dysfunction chronic inflammation fundamental COPD . Fish oil intake improve endothelial dysfunction lower level inflammatory intermediary . These inflammatory intermediary measure blood potentially important development COPD . Large observational study demonstrate participant eat high amount fish oil develop less COPD low level inflammatory intermediary . The Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Fish Oil ( COD-Fish ) Pilot Trial enroll 40-45 participant COPD . These participant randomize receive Omax3 [ TM ] placebo ( contain corn oil ) . Omax3 [ TM ] ( Cenestra Health ) 1 gram softgel capsule contain 94.5 % omega-3 fatty acid . Each participant take 3 capsule either Omax3 [ TM ] match placebo . The investigator subject blind , mean neither investigator subject know take Omax3 [ TM ] placebo . All participant perform number noninvasive test study entry well every two month total six month . They also undergo pulmonary function test , flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) , peripheral arterial tonometry ( PAT ) , six minute-walk test ( 6MWT ) , blood draw answer questionnaire data . Thirty participant agree undergo separate procedure collect cell inside forearm vein analysis compare 30 control . The main purpose trial examine effect Omax3 [ TM ] endothelial function measure change FMD patient COPD . We hypothesize subject COPD , treatment Omax3 [ TM ] increase FMD .</detailed_description>
