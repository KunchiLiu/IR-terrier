	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Of P276-00 In Subjects Of Malignant Melanoma Positive For Cyclin D1 Expression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , melanoma fifth common cancer diagnose men seventh common cancer diagnose women.Advanced melanoma poor prognosis.For vast majority subject malignant melanoma , effective therapies.Therefore , development effective therapy subject population remain priority oncology.In limited study melanoma , increase cyclin D1 protein expression , observe 33 % cases.P276-00 novel potent small molecule flavone derive Cyclin dependent kinase ( Cdk ) Cdk 4-D1 , Cdk1-B Cdk9-T inhibitor.P276-00 demonstrate significant selective antiproliferative effect melanoma cell line .</detailed_description>
