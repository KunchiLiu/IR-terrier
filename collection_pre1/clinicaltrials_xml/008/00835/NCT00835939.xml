	<detailed_description>The purpose research project optimize clinical outcome patient Achilles tendinopathy . Patients fail standardized physical therapy regiment ( eccentric training protocol ) randomly allocate two group one group receive injection hypertonic glucose Lidocaine ( sclerosing solution ) receive injection Lidocaine ( control ) . Neovascularisation ( growth new blood vessel nerve damage area tendon ) appear associated pain subsequently decrease function use affect tendon . Results observational study Sweden reveal patient eccentric train unsuccessful neovascularisation present . Sclerosis neovessels appear successful remove pain associate Achilles tendinopathy mid-portion enthesitis patient . However , study administer technique homogenous patient population prospective , control randomized manner . In addition , study compare effect eccentric train healthy individual versus patient painful Achilles tendinopathy control longitudinal study . It expect patient eccentric train unsuccessful subsequently receive sclerosing therapy show statistically significant improvement pain function .</detailed_description>
