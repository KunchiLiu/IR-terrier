	<brief_summary>This phase 0 trial study whether 2 week cetuximab dasatinib change tumor cell patient colorectal cancer liver metastases remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Dasatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab and/or Dasatinib Patients With Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastases That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate biological effect cetuximab , dasatinib , combination epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) - Src-signaling pathway resect colorectal cancer liver metastasis . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients initially enrol cohort A . Once cohort A complete , additional patient enrol randomized treatment either cohort B C. If significant biological effect see cohort B C , additional patient enrol cohort D. COHORT A : Patients receive systemic neoadjuvant therapy enrollment time definitive surgical resection liver metastasis . Liver biopsy perform surgery since cohort receive systemic therapy . COHORT B : Patients receive 400 mg/m2 cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 120 minute day 1 250 mg/m^2 cetuximab IV 60-120 minute day 8 . Definitive surgical resection liver metastasis take place day 15 . COHORT C : Patients receive dasatinib 100 mg orally daily day 1-14 . Definitive surgical resection liver metastasis take place day 15 . COHORT D : Patients receive 400 mg/m^2 cetuximab IV 120 minute day 1 250 mg/m^2 cetuximab IV 60-120 minute day 8 AND dasatinib 100 mg orally daily day 1-14 . Definitive surgical resection liver metastasis take place day 15 . Patients undergo tumor tissue ( initial liver tumor biopsy liver resection sample ) , serum , peripheral blood mononuclear cell sample collection periodically biomarker analysis via immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) .</detailed_description>
