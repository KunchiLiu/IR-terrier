Working hypothesis aim : Management oral candidiasis feasible . The major disadvantage mode action day substantively drug oral cavity patient compliance . A sustained release varnish easily apply denture , also release anti fungal drug least day , may overcome pit fall treatment apply today . Based past experience , develop local sustain release varnish dental use , anticipate also formulate special anti fungal sustain release varnish fit special unique need elderly population . Methods : Sustained release varnish develop laboratory . The kinetics release ( use HPLC ) antifungal activity ( Bioassays ) examine vitro . The formulation show optimal result test human subject oral candidiasis . The efficacy varnish examine clinically ( reduction symptom ) , microbiology ( reduction oral fungal ) , pharmaceutically ( release kinetics vivo ) . Expected result : The clinical come one time varnish application improve compare five time application lozenge ( use today ) . The severity disease decrease heal period shorten drastically .
