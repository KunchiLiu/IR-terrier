	<brief_title>The Effects Combined Spinal Epidurals Fever During Labor First-Time Mothers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrapartum fever ( fever labor ) real potentially devastate problem . Infants delivered term expose mother fever labor &gt; 9 fold increase risk cerebral palsy . Studies also show increase risk neonatal encephalopathy associate fever labor . Maternal fever absence infection associate 4 fold increase risk neonatal hypoxic encephalopathy 3.4 fold increase risk unexplained neonatal seizure . The likely role inflammatory mediator process maternal fever ( temperature &gt; 100.4 ) , regardless etiology , make important investigational study effort discover etiology intrapartum fever associate epidural analgesia . If inflammatory trigger ( i.e. , injection epidural local anesthetic ) identify delay , risk maternal hyperthermia minimize and/ eliminate . The great risk fever epidural labor analgesia see woman first child . This population associate prolonged labor . Although intrapartum fever low incidence overall , 11-33 % first-time mother eventually develop fever &gt; 100.4 epidural analgesia . Although degree rise temperature occur slowly , show significant enough cause increase neonatal sepsis workup antibiotic coverage mother neonate .</detailed_description>
