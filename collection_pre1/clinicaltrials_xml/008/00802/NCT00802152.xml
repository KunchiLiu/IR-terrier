	<brief_title>Using Health Information Technology ( HIT ) Improve Ambulatory Chronic Disease Care : Smart Device Substudy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate effectiveness short-term target use remote data transmission in-home device ( blood glucose meter/blood pressure machine ) clinic treatment outcomes patient diabetes range blood glucose ( BG ) systolic blood pressure ( BP ) measurement . Increased frequency data transmission provide provider `` real time '' data order make timely adjustment treatment plan , result improved glycemic control measure A1c value hypertension measure systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) . Subjects recruit Family &amp; Community Medicine ( FCM ) General Internal Medicine ( GIM ) clinic . We randomly select patient physician minimum number 5 eligible patient performance measurement list ( A1c &gt; =8 % SBP &gt; 130 ) approach study . Patients agree enroll randomize experimental control use block randomization approach stratify age increment ( 18-40 ; 41-55 ; 56-70 ; 71+ ) . Subjects randomize use prepared sealed envelope . A total 200 subject ( 100 intervention subject 100 control subject ) enrol period one year . We attempt enroll equal number FCM GIM subject . For subject , baseline data collect patient , include demographic data ( age , gender , race , year formal education ) , payor status ( private pay , insurance , Medicaid ) , number co-morbid condition , baseline blood pressure , length time diagnose diabetes ( DM ) hypertension . Intervention patient instructed test BP BG accord minimum protocol least daily upload clinical data least every day 3-month study duration , frequency could tailor provider , i.e. , daily . At least 2 BG reading week fasting level . Patient train emphasize system emergency response system , i.e. , critical value treat usual manner . Control group patient ( receive device ) ask test BP BG least daily ( fashion intervention group ) . They instruct bring reading clinic visit , end study . We collect reading . Data patient download website enter data . These data may print MD review verbally communicate . APNs FCM make change patient treatment base currently establish privilege , e.g. , medication adjustment ; RNs GIM FCM review data MDs change treatment plan . All treatment change individualize accord patient need , i.e. , standardize blood glucose management protocol employ . Communication change therapy patient accomplish per usual clinic protocol , e.g. , usually telephone call patient , documentation telephone note medical record . After three month , subject return clinic A1c BP measure , post study survey . Data collection include achievement clinical goal blood glucose ( A1c measure end 3 month intervention [ +/- 2 week ] BP ) . If enrolled subject available A1c BP measure record record end 6 month , collect data assess long term effect intervention . Patient record review intervention provide patient ( i.e. , document process medication change , advice provide ) . Interview data collect physician nurse : perception use data device ; patient perception home-device application , patient use rate data upload ( intervention ) , frequency BG BP test intervention period ( intervention control patient ) . The primary outcome measure comparison A1c three month follow enrollment ( i.e. , patient meet goal &gt; 0.5 % change A1c SBP &lt; 130 ) . The proportion patient meet blood glucose / BP goal three month enrollment compute intervention group control group . For group , denominator number patient enrol group ( thus meeting recommended goal time enrollment ) . The numerator patient meet recommended goal determine office visit occur three month ( +/- 14 calendar day ) enrollment . Changes care process categorize described , related patient enter data ( daily blood glucose measure ) . Physician nurse perception data analyze use qualitative approach . Intervention group patient perception satisfaction home-device application measure use short survey analyze descriptively . In intervention group , patient use rate calculate include percent reading submit numerator total expect denominator ( e.g. , submit 70 readings/90 day = 78 % use rate ) . RN time per week data review &amp; follow analyze descriptively assess burden respond monitoring data . Data collect time enrollment patient training order estimate cost associate intervention .</detailed_description>
