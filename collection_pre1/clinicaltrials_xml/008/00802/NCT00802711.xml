	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy , 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy , delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Internal radiation use radioactive material place directly near tumor kill tumor cell . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy effective internal radiation therapy give surgery treat early-stage breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy see well work compare internal radiation therapy give breast-conserving surgery treat woman stage I stage II breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To compare rate successfully deliver accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) use 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy v multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy woman stage I II invasive ductal carcinoma breast . - To establish potential patient participation ongoing phase III clinical trial ( e.g. , NSABP-B-39 , GEC-ESTRO , RAPID , MPORT , IRMA ) compare APBI standard whole-breast irradiation . Secondary - To assess acute radiation-induced toxicity patient assess NCI CTCAE version 3.0 . - To assess long-term radiation-induced toxicity patient assess RTOG-EORTC scale . - To assess incidence type adverse event breast patient . - To assess incidence type procedure-related complication patient . - To determine local control pattern recurrence patient . - To determine disease-free survival ( distant recurrence-free survival ) patient . - To determine overall survival patient . - To assess cosmesis patient assess Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome RTOG scale . - To assess treatment-related symptom patient assess Breast Cancer Treatment Outcome scale . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Patients lumpectomy cavity/whole breast ratio 25-30 % assign treatment arm II . - Arm I : Patients undergo accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) use 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy twice daily 5-10 day ( total 10 fraction ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients undergo APBI use multi-catheter interstitial brachytherapy twice daily 5-10 day ( total 10 fraction ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaire baseline , last day treatment , 4 24 week completion treatment , annually 3 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically least 5 year .</detailed_description>
