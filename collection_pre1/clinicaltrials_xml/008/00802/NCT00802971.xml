	<brief_summary>Idiopathic reactive hypoglycemia ( IRH ) describe condition recurrent episodes symptomatic hypoglycemia occur one four hour meal , usually follow meal rich carbohydrate . Differential diagnosis exclude include caused isulinomas bariatric surgery ( dump syndrome ) , iatrogenic induce hypoglycaemia . The prevalence IRH fully know . A British trial among 1136 random choose woman age 17-50 , report 37.9 % experienced symptomatic hypoglycemia four time every month ( mean value ) . However , report symptom attribute low blood glucose ( BG ) correlate measure low level BG `` true '' hypoglycaemic episode , i.e. , define American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) plasma BG value &lt; 3,9 mmol/l without accompany symptom . This underscored three study England , Canada Denmark , report hypoglycaemic symptom , accompany plasma glucose value &lt; 3,3 mmol/l hypoglycaemic symptom occur 23 , 47 0 % study subject , respectively . The majority symptom relate IRH hence symptom without classified hypoglycemic accord conventional interpretation . However , new ( 2005 ) ADA definition ; relative hypoglycemia , also comprise symptomatic case hypoglycemia follow plasma glucose &gt; 3,9 mmol/l . Hormonal cerebral mechanism tightly control complex interplay mechanism involve regulate BG concentration . Explanations IRH centralize around increased insulin secretion/sensitivity and/or regulate transcription glucagon receptor reduce glucagon sensitivity- secretion . Others assess overabundance adrenaline cortisol , witch excrete nadir BS curve ( venous plasma glucose 3.6 3.9 ) . The latter event , typical symptom characterize anxiety , fatigue , irritability , palpitation , nervousness , tachycardia , tremor sweat . Today , treatment limit dietary recommendation eat frequent meal moderate size , reasonably high protein , low glycaemic load . These advice keep cerebral glucose concentration stable prohibit neuroglycopenic symptom like hunger , dizziness , tingle , blur vision , difficulty thinking , faintness . Pharmacologic attempt treat IRH involve diazoxide , metformin , Î±-glucosidase inhibitor , glitazones somatostatin , however , none medication specifically indicated condition . Fiber class carbohydrate resistant hydrolytic digestion upper bowel ferment colon bacterially produce enzymes . It make rate ventricular empty increase prolongs bowel transit time ; thus minimal impact BG value . Inulin oligofructose composed polymer oligofructose characteristic feature different fiber physiological biochemical attribute . Found variety edible fruit vegetable , fermentation produce short-chain fatty acid acidify colonic content . This stimulate selectively growth beneficial potentially health-promoting bifidobacteria reduce potential harmful colon bacteria . Acting prebiotica , oligofructose induces change colonic epithelium miscellaneous colonic function , inter alia , enhance calcium magnesium absorption , modulate endocrine well immune function affect metabolism lipid positively . The latter , systemic level , may contribute modulate lipogenesis reduce triglyceridemia partially impair hepatic cholesterol synthesis . FOS yet investigate thoroughly possible stabilizer blood glucose . However , several non-oligofructose study , use high-fiber diet , indicate reduced pre-prandial BG value , less hypoglycemic case , glukosuri , total cholesterol , triglyceride , VLDL cholesterol area curve ( AUC ) 24 hour measurement ( every 2 hour ) BG insulin concentration . Clinical evaluation safety inulin oligofruktose dietary fiber report 20 g/day oligofructose well tolerate . The various GI side effect identify include abdominal pain bloating , flatulence osmotic diarrhea . Despite fact fiber intake proven inversely related hypoglycemic event , possible benefit daily FOS-supplementation yet investigate systematically person suffer IRH . Given estimate high prevalence IRH aim : 1 . Study prevalence characteristic subject IRH relevant Norwegian study population 414 study participant . 2 . Evaluating effect FOS supplementation blood glucose variability .</brief_summary>
