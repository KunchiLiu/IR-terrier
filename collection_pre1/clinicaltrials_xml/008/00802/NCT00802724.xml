	<brief_summary>The primary purpose proposal conduct prospective , randomize , control clinical trial examine whether treatment base person 's direction-specific , impairment-based LBP classification effective Non-specific treatment improve short- ( 6 week ) long-term ( 6 12 month ) outcomes people chronic LBP . We hypothesize treatment base person 's direction-specific , impairment-based LBP classification ( Classification-specific ) result well outcomes Non-specific treatment . Our approach classification-directed treatment base proposal person 's LBP result adopt direction-specific strategy movement alignment spine use repeatedly person 's everyday activity . The exposure spine tissue repeat loading direction across day propose accelerate accumulation stress , microtrauma , eventually LBP . We also hypothesize factor contribute use direction-specific strategy spine modify , LBP problem persist recur . Identification homogeneous subgroup people LBP enhance 1 ) power clinical trial , 2 ) prognosis , 3 ) ability identify mechanism contribute different LBP problem .</brief_summary>
