	<brief_title>Efavirenz ( EFV ) HIV-Infected HIV/Tuberculosis ( TB ) Coinfected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An increase number child resource-limited country require treatment HIV tuberculosis ( TB ) ; however , option antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) compatible concurrent rifampin-containing anti-TB therapy limit . As result , treatment HIV/TB-coinfected patient remain difficult multiple drug interaction , high pill burden , overlap toxicity , possible immune reconstitution affect treatment outcome . The use EFV adult old child allow maintain non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) backbone receive TB therapy include rifampin . In young child TB/HIV coinfection , first-line treatment recommendation triple-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) regimen . However , regimen show less effective EFV plus NNRTI-based regimen . In addition , triple-NRTI regimen resource-limited setting costly limited data patient TB , monitor drug-related hypersensitivity reaction difficult . All factor make EFV attractive agent use HIV-infected pediatric patient without TB coinfection . This study evaluate safety , tolerance , pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) EFV administer open capsule pediatric patient young 3 year age , without concomitant rifampin-containing anti-TB therapy . This study also investigate genetic polymorphism , include CYP 2B6 , help establish dose guideline . This study two cohort enroll time . Cohort I , Step 1 enroll HIV-infected infant without TB coinfection eligible initiation ART . Cohort I , Step 1 administer EFV 24 week . EFV dosage , Cohort I , Step 1 , range 50 mg 600 mg daily , base weight CYP 2B6 genotype . Participants Cohort I Step 1 develop TB TB immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome ( IRIS ) require anti-TB medication allow enroll Cohort I , Step 2 , receive rifampin-containing anti-TB therapy high dose EFV ( 50 mg 800 mg ) account anticipated impact rifampin EFV PKs . If participant Cohort I , Step 2 require 24 week anti-TB therapy unable obtain EFV capsule in-country source , may remain study longer 24 week discontinue anti-TB therapy , 36 week study duration . Participants Cohort II HIV/TB coinfected infant eligible ART treat tolerated rifampin-containing anti-TB treatment regimen least 1 week prior enrollment . Participants Cohort II follow take rifampin-containing anti-TB EFV therapy 24 week ; participant unable obtain EFV capsule in-country source conclusion study may remain study discontinue anti-TB therapy , 36 week study duration . An estimated 10 20 participant Cohort II follow every 4 week study provide EFV completion TB treatment ( 36 week study duration ) . Participants cohort stratify base age . One stratification include child 3 month young 24 month age , second stratification include child 24 month young 36 month age . Participants stratify cytochrome P450 genotype polymorphism , include CYP 2B6 . All participant receive EFV-based ART regimen use capsule formulation EFV two NRTIs ( choose site investigator ) . EFV capsule open small amount compatible , familiar , locally available food liquid ( e.g. , formula , express breast milk , mash banana ) . Study visit occur screen , entry , Weeks 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 ; participant may continue visit every 4 week Week 24 Week 36 . At visit , participant undergo physical exam , give medical history , blood urine collect . At visit , dry blood spot ( DBS ) prepare plasma sample store . The Week 2 visit also consist intensive PK sampling blood collect prior take EFV dose 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 hour post-dose . Individual dose adjustment may make base result Week 2 visit .</detailed_description>
