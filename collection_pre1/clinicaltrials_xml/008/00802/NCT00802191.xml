	<brief_summary>Purpose study : The purpose study investigate Wii remote game control device use study Movement Disorders . The term `` Movement Disorders '' refers group abnormal medical condition characterize involuntary body movement . Current treatment disorder primarily gear improve symptom . Rating scale usually use grade response treatment . These rating scale require special training , take lot time , often present great variability . Thus , development simple device perform efficacy measurement offer great advantage current method less costly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The expected length take part study depend whether subject choose group look reproducibility data collect Wii remote . If subject agree take part study , basic data include age , gender , ethnicity , medication collect . If subject diagnose movement disorder , diagnosis also record . This data secure HIPAA compliant computer system record data give unique random code . During Wii remote portion study , subject ask hold Wii remote controller several different position perform various movement controller . These include : 1 . Holding controller still elbow straight elbow bent . 2 . Tapping control button fast . 3 . Rotation wrist fast . 4 . Bending wrist elbow fast . 5 . Walking 30 foot . 6 . Attaching controller arm Velcro strap repeat motion perform hold controller . These maneuver do first right left hand . We expect series take 5 minute . If subject Parkinson 's disease also ask undergo Part III ( Motor Sub-Scale ) Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale . This scale measure various aspect finger tapping , hand open closing walk scale 0 - 4 . We expect portion examination take 5 minute . If subject carry diagnosis Essential Tremor , ask undergo Standard Measure EssentialTremor include draw spiral pour water one glass another . Again , estimate scale take 5 minute . If subject carry diagnosis Parkinson 's disease Essential Tremor deep brain stimulation surgery , result use Wiiâ„¢ Remote game controller ( handheld attach use Velcro strap ) do clinical programming appointment . The information obtain used clinical use interfere normal standard care . A sub-set patient ask repeat measure various time see either learn curve , measure repeatable time . Subjects may decline point time .</detailed_description>
