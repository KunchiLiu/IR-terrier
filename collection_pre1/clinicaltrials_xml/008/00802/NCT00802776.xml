	<detailed_description>Penetrating keratoplasty ( PKP ) full-thickness corneal transplantation common highly successful method restore vision decrease corneal opacification . Surgery perform use round trephine blade create match circumferential incision diseased cornea donor cornea . Several type blade currently available create uniform corneal cut . The donor tissue graft secure place suture usually remove postoperatively one two year . The primary surgical goal preservation clear graft improvement vision . Surgical outcome limit donor-recipient junction mismatch , astigmatism , rejection , infection wind dehiscence . The femtosecond laser focusable , infrared laser capable cut tissue various depth range pattern , currently use create corneal lamellar flap LASIK surgery . The laser parameter adjust submicron precision cut desired diameter , depth shape cornea , minimal collateral injury . This technology capable create full-thickness corneal trephination customize lock edge graft-host junction donor recipient corneas Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Keratoplasty ( FLAK ) . This approach may allow good wound junction donor recipient cornea , turn may also significantly reduce astigmatism , improve wound heal visual recovery . Although femtosecond laser approve FDA use corneal transplant , compare standard corneal transplant technique . This pilot study help u determine optimal femtosecond laser spot size , separation , fluency , energy result best graft-host fit . Surgical eligibility criterion , include preoperative diagnosis , well possible associate medical ophthalmic condition eventual multi-center study define . Primary outcome measure , include corneal refractive power measurement , serial endothelial-cell count assess endothelial survival vision-specific quality life survey , evaluate . The specific aim investigate postoperative physiology biomechanics FLAK human eye . The significance FLAK present corneal surgeon opportunity avoid problem PKP offer safer precise approach treat visually disable disease secondary corneal opacification .</detailed_description>
