	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND Plant sterols stanols compound structurally relate cholesterol , decrease intestinal cholesterol absorption consequently serum LDL cholesterol concentration 10-14 % . Nowadays plant sterol stanols widely available incorporate food product like margarine yogurt present functional food . Whether cholesterol lower effect plant sterol stanols also favorably affect endothelial function human currently unknown . Apart cholesterol lower effect , plant sterol stanols might effect like effect red blood cell property , cognitive performance antioxidant status . Especially evaluate effect type parameter long-term daily consumption plant sterols stanols necessary . These question answer statin treated patient since functional food enrich plant sterol stanol ester recommend statin-users `` add '' therapy . This may ultimately lead low dose statin increase number patient reach target LDL-cholesterol reduction . AIM The major objective present proposal examine effect long-term consumption plant sterols stanols endothelial function vessel wall statin-treated patient . STUDY DESIGN Subjects : The subject recruit among men woman Maastricht surroundings , age 18 70 year . Participation voluntary basis . People willing participate invite two screen visit . Experimental design : The present study double-blind , randomize parallel intervention trial 60 statin-treated subject , metabolic effect long term ( 90 week ) consumption plant sterols stanols ( 2.5 g/day ) study . After run-in period 5 week subject randomly divide three group 20 subject . One group continue control margarine without added plant sterol stanols , one group use plant sterol margarine last group use plant stanol margarine 85 week . The major endpoint endothelial function vessel wall , addition various parameter related lipid lipoprotein metabolism , erythrocyte characteristic cognitive performance measure . Risk subject The margarine contain plant sterol stanols safe palatable . Venipunctures ( non-invasive ) measurement carry skilled person risk . A subject spend approximately 1 hour month participate study .</brief_summary>
