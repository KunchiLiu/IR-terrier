	<brief_title>Dacarbazine Metastatic Soft Tissue Bone Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The two reason dacarbazine eliminate treatment option patient metastatic sarcoma include inability effectively address drug 's major toxicity ( emesis neutropenia ) prevail opinion drug less effective chemotherapeutic agent . Specific Aim # 1 : The primary endpoint study determine overall best tumor anatomic response rate ( CR- complete response , PR - partial response , SD - stable disease , PD - progressive disease ) dacarbazine give disease progression assess RECIST criterion use CT clinical examination patient metastatic sarcoma . The prevailing opinion dacarbazine less effective chemotherapeutic agent set base data control randomized clinical trial . Indeed , aware single randomize trial conduct report compare anti-tumor activity single agent dacarbazine active single agent patient population . However , phase two trial clearly establish dacarbazine anti-tumor activity treatment metastatic sarcoma , personal experience institution confirm true . In addition , randomize trial demonstrate addition dacarbazine doxorubicin increase tumor response rate doxorubicin alone.12 The literature support conclusion dacarbazine anti-tumor activity treatment metastatic sarcoma . Historically , study , tumor response dacarbazine assess WHO criteria . However , current assessment tumor response usually base RECIST criterion , differ WHO criterion , show : Studies perform determine tumor anatomic response rate single agent dacarbazine use RECIST criterion . This study determine tumor anatomic response rate assess RECIST criterion dacarbazine patient metastatic sarcoma . Modern method CT scan use assess tumor response contrast early method assess tumor response dacarbazine use publish report . These method include physical examination conventional X-ray first generation , low resolution CT scan . The current method radiologic assessment tumor response superior use 15 year ago . The late generation CT scan accurately measure image tumor mass , may better assess tumor response therapy . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine overall risk nausea/emesis ( grade ) neutropenia ( grade 3 4 ) dacarbazine give current antiemetic agent ( 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 serotonin antagonist , dexamethasone , aprepitant ) pegfilgrastim . Historically , dacarbazine-induced toxicity emesis myelosuppression common lead significant dose reduction delay could negatively impact drug 's anti-tumor activity . When dacarbazine initially identify potentially effective agent treatment sarcoma , anti-emetic drug available limited efficacy . Also , measure available prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia . Today , effective drug prevent reduce frequency chemotherapy-induced emesis neutropenia . Dacarbazine carry risk emesis ( grade ) &gt; 90 % case administer without antiemetics13 . A three-drug anti-emetic combination 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 serotonin antagonist , dexamethasone , aprepitant current recommendation ASCO administer highly emetogenic chemotherapy drugs13 . Hesketh , et al report risk emesis ( grade ) follow highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( cisplatin ) pre-medication three drug anti-emetic regimen 27 % compare two drug regimen ondansetron dexamethasone risk 48 % ( p &lt; 0.001 ) 14 . Prior study show risk grade 3 4 neutropenia follow dacarbazine give without granulocyte- colony stimulate factor 36 % 15 . Granulocyte- colony stimulate factor ( pegfilgrastim neupogen ) effective agent prevent chemotherapy-induced neutropenia . Crawford , et al show randomized trial risk chemotherapy- induce grade four neutropenia one day G-CSF compare six day placebo15 . Subsequent randomized trial show equivalent efficacy pegfilgrastim compare neupogen16 . Vogel , et al report phase three double blind randomized trial patient breast cancer receive docetaxel 100 mg/m2 pegfilgrastim compare placebo reduce incidence febrile neutropenia ( 1 % vs 17 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) febrile neutropenia-related hospitalization ( 1 % vs 14 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) 17 . In trial , hypothesize implementation newer anti-nausea agent ( 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 serotonin antagonist , dexamethasone , aprepitant ) granulocyte-colony stimulate factor ( pegfilgrastim ) primary prophylactic strategy reduce frequency dacarbazine-induced nausea/emesis ( grade ) neutropenia ( grade 3 4 ) . Specific Aim # 3 : To compare SUV three target tumor sit determine overall tumor metabolic response ( complete metabolic response , partial metabolic response , stable metabolic disease progressive metabolic disease ( CMR , PMR , SMD , PMD ) assess FDG-PET/CT perform baseline every three cycle treatment dacarbazine . Studies perform determine change FDG uptake PET image follow dacarbazine patient metastatic sarcoma . There limited publish data change FDG uptake PET image follow chemotherapy agent patient metastatic sarcoma . However , emerge body data show prognostic impact early tumor response target agent ( imatinib sunitinib ) assess FDG-PET patient metastatic GIST18 . In trial , determine tumor metabolic response dacarbazine assess FDG-PET/CT correlate tumor anatomic response assess CT scan .</detailed_description>
