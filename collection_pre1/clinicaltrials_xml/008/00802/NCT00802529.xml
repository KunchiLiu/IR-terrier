	<brief_title>Transtympanic Gentamicin vs. Steroids Refractory Meniere 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meniere 's disease characterise episodic spontaneous vertigo attack hear loss , ring sound fullness ear . In one five patient , standard first line medical treatment effective control vertigo attack . For incapacitated patient , gentamicin injection ear drum well establish minimally invasive treatment . Major surgery balance organ nerve , risk complete hearing loss , CSF leak , meningeal infection , rarely perform nowadays . Gentamicn effective control vertigo act chemical ablation end organ . As hear balance organ entwine around , gentamicin treatment come without risk hearing loss . In fact , meta-analysis show hear deterioration 13 % 35 % percent gentamicin treat patient . On hand , steroid drug choice autoimmune inner ear disease commonly use sudden hearing loss . They non toxic drug without know side effect local treatment ear . We compare two randomised , double blind trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients unilateral Ménière 's disease ( definite probable , accord Committee Hearing Equilibrium guideline , 1995 ) hearing loss present recurrent vertigo , respond medical treatment least 6 month include . There normal , age appropriate hearing contralateral ear . Patients Ménière 's disease later stag ( vertigo attack ) . Age : patient older 70 year start trial . Severe disability ( e.g . neurological , orthopaedic , cardiovascular ) serious concurrent illness might interfere treatment follow . Active additional neurootological disorder may mimic Ménière 's disease ( e.g . vestibular migraine , vertebrobasilar TIAs , acoustic neuroma ) thus make objective follow difficult . Concurrent ear pathology may interfere transtympanic treatment ( e.g . active middle ear disease ) . Family history unexplained deafness ( possibility genetic susceptibility gentamicin toxicity ) . History know adverse/allergic reaction steroid gentamicin .</criteria>
