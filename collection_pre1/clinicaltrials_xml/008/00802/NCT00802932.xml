	<brief_summary>The purpose study test metallic marker breast tissue breast conserving surgery observe metallic marker ' stability breast use tumor bed marker position device radiation treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Validate Metallic Markers Image Guided Radiation Therapy Breast Cancer Tx</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order validate metallic marker placement stability , patient internal metallic marker place time last breast surgery ( either lumpectomy re-excision margin ) surgeon permanent . They undergo routine 3D CT-based treatment plan receive routine radiation treatment whole breast partial breast determine treat physician . Daily image breast obtain throughout treatment use online portal imaging system . These image analyze daily position metallic marker compare across entire course treatment determine stability metallic marker placement assess efficacy position device image guide radiation therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirm stage 0 , I II bilateral unilateral breast cancer Any invasive adenocarcinoma intraductal carcinoma Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status â‰¤ 2 Surgical treatment lumpectomy ( partial mastectomy ) Successful placement intraparenchymal metallic marker last breast surgery Pathologic tumor size &lt; 5.0 cm ( Microscopic multifocality allow total pathologic tumor size within 5 cm ) Axillary sampling ( sentinel node axillary dissection ) perform axillary nodal stag invasive cancer . No axillary sampling require ductal carcinoma situ ) Negative margin excision . Radiation treatment begin within 8 week last surgery last dose chemotherapy Negative postbiopsy mammogram present mammographically detected microcalcifications ensure removal suspicious calcification History prior cancer allow patient without evidence disease time study entry Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Pregnant breast feed time study entry . Note : Radiation therapy teratogenic . Women child bear potential must agree use adequate contraception ( abstinence , hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study participation . Should woman become pregnant , inform treat physician immediately . Prior infield irradiation Stage III IV breast cancer Inability place intraparenchymal metallic marker due excessive bleeding intraoperative complication surgeon deem inadvisable place marker Pathologic tumor size &gt; /= 5 cm Positive unassessed margin surgical resection Diffuse calcification mammogram pre postoperatively Positive suspicious postlumpectomy mammogram breast magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) Multicentric carcinoma one quadrant breast Nonepithelial breast malignancy ; Paget 's disease nipple Personal history collagen vascular disease clinically judge contraindication radiation therapy Recurrent disease prior history ipsilateral breast cancer Psychiatric addictive disorder impair patient 's voluntary ability participate inform consent protocol procedure</criteria>
