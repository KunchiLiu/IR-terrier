	<detailed_description>Background : It apparent virtually every human post-natal tissue contain type stem/progenitor cell population responsible tissue turnover repair . Our previous study identify subset human bone marrow stromal cell ( BMSCs ) multi-potent able regenerate bone , cartilage , myelosupportive stroma adipocytes , whereas stromal cell derive human spleen ( SpSCs ) thymus ( TSCs ) form myelosupportive stroma . Recent study suggest human adipose-derived stromal cell ( ASCs ) may similar BMSCs , whereas stromal cell derive human dermis ( DSCs ) none property ( serve negative control experiment vitro vivo ) . How similar dissimilar different stromal cell population yet determine . Molecular profiling need compare different population order elucidate factor control differentiation stromal cell one cell type another . Objectives : Surgical waste ( bone red marrow , dermis , adipose tissue ) male females vary age undergo clinically indicate surgical procedure use establish stromal cell culture study molecular profile differentiation capacity stromal cell population different tissue , characterize regulation gene expression protein synthesis stem/progenitors cell . Eligibility : Any patient undergoing clinically indicate surgery entail removal bone red marrow , dermis adipose tissue . Design : Normal surgical waste ( bone red marrow , dermis , adipose ) procedure perform male females Children 's Hospital place nutrient medium ( provide NIDCR ) send NIDCR establishment cell culture strain . Only age , gender , site tissue remove clinical diagnosis record . The cell culture different tissue use determine phenotypic character differentiation property molecular profiling , study elucidate regulation gene expression protein synthesis . Similarly , portion sample obtain Children 's Hospital use generate histological section tissue . In case , RNA extract tissue RT-PCR analysis . Normal sample ( cell , section , mRNA ) also serve normal control study perform sample obtain patient various disease recruit NIH current NIH protocol ( 97-D-0055 , 97-D-0145 , 01-D-0184 ) . Pathological sample ( cell , section , mRNA ) study order elucidate cause disease .</detailed_description>
