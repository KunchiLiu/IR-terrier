	<brief_title>Application Of Autologous Blood Products During Modified Radical Mastectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A frequent complication mastectomy seroma formation rate literature report 3-50 % . Although seroma formation consider nuisance serious complication , presence seroma lead wound infection , skin flap necrosis , wound dehiscence , nerve injury , lymphedema mastectomy patients.Various approach reduce seroma formation include use external compression dressing , ultrasound cut device , suction drainage system , bovine thrombin . Although intervention demonstrate efficacy , none gain widespread acceptance . Investigation alternative intervention mastectomy procedure could reduce rate postoperative seroma formation , thereby reduce likelihood onset serious complication , still value patient surgeon . The use autologous blood product ( ABP ) , particular platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) , advocate numerous indication . As surgical tool , ABP typically apply surgical site latter stage procedure combination bovine thrombin . The aim PRP application accelerate heal cascade via application elevate cytokine concentration release platelet degranulation . It hypothesize elevated cytokine level elucidate accelerate heal response affect tissue . Preliminary evidence suggest expedite heal response correlate reduction postoperative wound complication . Platelet poor plasma , by-product PRP processing , advocate provide additional hemostasis . The majority literature discuss clinical application ABP date , unblinded nonrandomized . Although useful demonstration safety ABP , current literature truly investigate efficacy application . There need well-designed , well-controlled study investigate application ABP surgical tool . It hypothesize significant reduction postoperative complication , particular seroma formation , result due use ABP procedure .</detailed_description>
