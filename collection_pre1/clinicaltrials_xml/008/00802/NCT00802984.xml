	<criteria>1 . Patient candidate repair descend thoracic aortic aneurysm . 2 . Patient one following : Descending thoracic aneurysm , 5 cm diameter great proximal distal neck suitable stent graft placement . Aneurysm 45 cm diameter increase size 0.5 cm last 6 month . Maximum diameter aneurysm exceed one onehalf time transverse dimension adjacent normal aortic segment . Posttraumatic pseudoaneurysm Postsurgical pseudoaneurysm Saccular aneurysm Contained rupture Penetrating ulcer 3 . Patient 's vascular dimension must range safely treated stent graft extension available physician time procedure . 4 . Patient patent iliac femoral artery acceptable retroperitoneal access via abdominal aorta allow endovascular access aneurysmal site 23F delivery catheter , typically use 25F introducer sheath 5 . Patient nonaneurysmal proximal distal aortic neck diameter 25 36 mm . 6 . Patient American Society Anesthesiology ( ASA ) grade 1 4 . 7 . Patient stage disease condition comparable satisfactory alternative device therapy available treatment ; patient immediately lifethreatening disease reasonable likelihood death occur within matter month premature death likely without early treatment . 8 . Patient able willing comply 1 month , 6 month , 1 year followup , willing comply annual posttreatment followup requirement thereafter . 9 . Patient patient 's legal representative understands sign Informed Consent . 1 . The stent graft would position would flow artery , major branch artery major branch artery supply spinal cord . 2 .
