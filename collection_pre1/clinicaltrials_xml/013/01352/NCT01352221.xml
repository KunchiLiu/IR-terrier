	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Oral Ferric Iron To Treat Iron Deficiency Anaemia Quiescent Crohn 's Disease ( AEGIS-2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As curative treatment currently available Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) , treatment option restrict control symptom , maintain remission prevent relapse . As , treatment iron deficiency anaemia ( IDA ) , key symptom disease , integral medical management CD . Iron deficiency anaemia CD chronically debilitate disorder significant impact quality life affect subject . Characteristic symptom IDA include chronic fatigue , headache , subtle impairment cognitive function . Up one third subject CD suffer recurrent anaemia , hospitalization require severe case . First line standard therapy mild moderate IDA CD typically oral ferrous product ( OFP ) , however often successful . Many subject intolerant suffer continuously occur side effect , occasional exacerbation inflammatory lesion failure correct iron deficiency . Common adverse effect OFP include nausea , epigastric discomfort constipation , dose-related appear especially evident subject CD . As compare oral ferrous iron , oral ferric iron administer improved tolerability total dose exposure unabsorbed iron within gastrointestinal tract significantly reduce . In addition , iron retain chelated form absorb may reduce risk irritation within gastrointestinal tract . Clinical study conduct date provide preliminary evidence therapeutic potential ST10-021 patient IDA Inflammatory Bowel Disease , include CD . The purpose study determine whether ST10-021 safe effective treatment IDA subject non-active CD . In effort target underserved population , study include subject fail OFP past , OFP use .</detailed_description>
