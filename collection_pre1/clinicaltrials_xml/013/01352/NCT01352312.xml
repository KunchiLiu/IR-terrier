	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 study Cohort Expansion Pentostatin , Bendamustine Ofatumumab ( PBO ) patient previously treat Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) B-cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( B- cell NHL ) . The purpose study determine optimal dose bendamustine combination pentostatin ofatumumab , see safe three drug work together .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Pentostatin , Bendamustine Ofatumumab Treatment Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) common form leukemia United States . There considerable progress understand biology treatment CLL last 20 year . However , even modern therapy , complete response ( CR ) achieve approximately 25 % patient relapsed/refractory disease . Multiple study demonstrate patient achieve CR well clinical outcome patient achieve CR therapy . B-cell NHL compose multiple subtypes neoplasm . These disease closely related CLL term natural history , biology , responsiveness similar therapeutic agent . These disease usually cure available chemotherapy ultimately patient succumb progression resistant disease . Therefore , need develop good therapy improve survival patient CLL B-cell NHL . Preclinical clinical data suggest pentostatin , bendamustine , ofatumumab active drug treatment B-cell malignancy . In earlier clinical trial conduct Dr. Weiss ( lead site PI ) , combination pentostatin cyclophosphamide good activity previously treat patient B-cell neoplasms . This regimen also well tolerate similar fludarabine-based regimen . The response rate improve addition rituximab , anti CD 20 antibody , regimen . Studies demonstrate synergy bendamustine purine analog like pentostatin kill cancer cell type CLL NHL . The combination three drug ( pentostatin , bendamustine ofatumumab ) test clinical setting anticipate combination regimen active individual drug alone . The aim trial find safe dose bendamustine use combination pentostatin ofatumumab patient previously treat CLL B-cell NHL .</detailed_description>
