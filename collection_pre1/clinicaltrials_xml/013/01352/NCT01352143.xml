	<brief_title>Thrombin Generation Neonatal Plasma After Cardiopulmonary Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In investigation , investigator propose comparison vitro ability rFVIIa PCC increase thrombin generation neonatal plasma CPB . A pre-cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) baseline blood sample obtain . After termination CPB administration one round protamine , platelet fibrinogen ( standard care ) , second blood sample drawn . All sample centrifuge yield platelet rich plasma store processing . In pre-CPB sample , baseline thrombin generation measure . The post-CPB sample divide three aliquot measure thrombin generation three different circumstance : first serve control , second include rFVIIa third PCC .</detailed_description>
