	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability autologous genetically modify T cell . Genetic material transfer subject 's previously harvest autologous T cell redirect target myeloma cell rather usual target . Study subject must systemic multifocal myeloma require autologous stem cell transplantation whose disease relapse incompletely responded prior therapy high-risk feature . Subjects must also measureable disease study entry , define quantifiable detectable level serum urine paraprotein elevate serum free light chain abnormal ratio .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Myeloma relapse , progress , fail respond least one prior course therapy ( consist least 2 treatment cycle month therapy ) Myeloma respond partially initial therapy complete response ( immunofixation negative normal serum free light chain ) NOT develop minimum 3 cycle month initial therapy Myeloma highrisk feature define presence one cytogenetic abnormality know confer poor outcome even standard autotransplants : complex karyotype ( ≥ 3 abnormality ) , ( 4 ; 14 ) , ( 14 ; 16 ) , del ( 17 ) ( p13.1 ) , and/or chromosome 13 abnormality . These patient may enrol even complete nearcomplete remission Measurable disease study entry , define quantifiable detectable level serum urine paraprotein elevate serum free light chain abnormal ratio Patients complete remission time propose study entry ( serum urine immunofixation consistently negative normal serum free light chain ) eligible unless disease meet criteria highrisk define protocol Ages 1880 ECOG performance status 02 ( unless due solely bone pain ) Prior Lenalidomide maintenance phase , study participant must register mandatory RevAssist® program , willing able comply requirement RevAssist® Females subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test male female ( childbearing potential ) subject must agree use reliable method contraception study . Lenalidomide treatment phase : able take aspirin ( 81 325 mg ) daily prophylactic anticoagulation ( patient intolerant ASA may use warfarin low molecular weight heparin ) HLAA201 patient must confirm expression NYESO1 and/or LAGE . HLAA2 patient must A201 allele Adequate vital organ function define : Serum creatinine ≤3.0 mg/dl dialysis WBC least 3000/mm³ , platelet count least 100,000/mm³ SGOT ≤ 2 x upper limit normal bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl ( unless due Gilbert 's syndrome ) Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 45 % . A low LVEF permissible formal cardiologic evaluation reveals evidence clinically significant functional impairment Adequate pulmonary function mechanical parameter ≥ 40 % predict ( FEV1 , FVC , TLC , DLCO ) . Patients unable complete PFTs due bone pain fracture must high resolution CT scan chest must acceptable arterial blood gas define room air PO2 great 70 mmHg Patients recover toxicity relate prior therapy least returned baseline level organ function . Patients glucocorticoids least 2 week and/or therapy least 1 week prior enrollment Pregnant nursing female HIV HTLV1/2 seropositivity History myelodysplasia History chronic active hepatitis liver cirrhosis ( suspected laboratory study , confirm liver biopsy ) Active Hepatitis B ( define positive Hepatitis B surface antigen ) ; positive Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody NOT exclusion Prior allogeneic transplant History severe autoimmune disease require steroid immunosuppressive treatment Active immune mediate disease include : connective tissue disease , uveitis , sarcoidosis , inflammatory bowel disease , multiple sclerosis Evidence history significant cardiac , hepatic , renal , ophthalmologic , psychiatric , gastrointestinal disease would likely increase risk participate study Active bacterial , viral , fungal infection</criteria>
