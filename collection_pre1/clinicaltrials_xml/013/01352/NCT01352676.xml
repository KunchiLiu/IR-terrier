	<brief_summary>Computed tomography ( CT ) scan overuse , expensive , cause cancer . CT scan utilization U.S. increase estimate 3 million CTs 1980 62 million per year 2007 . From 2000 2006 , Medicare spend image double $ 13.8 billion advance image CT scan largely responsible . CT represent 11 % radiologic examination responsible two-thirds ionize radiation associate medical imaging U.S . Recent estimate suggest 12.5 cancer death every 10,000 CT scan . Renal colic common , non-life-threatening condition CT overuse . As many 12 % people kidney stone lifetime , one million per year present emergency department ( ED ) . CT first line test renal colic , accurate . However , 98 % kidney stone 5mm small pas spontaneously , CT rarely alter management . A decision rule need determine patient suspect renal colic require CT . While sign symptom renal colic show predictable , rule yet rigorously derive validate guide CT image renal colic . A subset patient suspect renal colic may serious diagnosis kidney stone require intervention ; however investigator maintain clinical criterion , point care ultrasound plain radiography ( appropriate ) , provide comparatively effective safe approach appropriately limit imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Limit Computed Tomography ( CT ) Scanning Suspected Renal Colic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Aim : The specific aim study prospectively validate previously derive decision rule obtain Flank Pain Protocol ( FPP ) CT scan suspect renal colic . The investigator integrate derive clinical decision rule ongoing retrospective analysis gestalt clinician pre-test probability , point care ultrasound , plain radiography ( appropriate ) prospectively observationally test rule two distinct clinical setting . CT result 90-day follow-up use determine predefined outcomes . Study Hypothesis : Prospective observational test clinical decision rule , combine point care ultrasound plain radiography appropriate , categorize &gt; 85 % patient require intervention , validate decision rule avoid unnecessary CT . This amendment come recent evidence work institution develop `` ultra-low dose '' CT scan protocol ( ULDCT ) effective radiation dose close plain film abdomen ( KUB ) , near 1mSv ( compare 8.5mSv current practice ) . While expect ULDCT good KUB localize characterize kidney stone , unknown loss resolution ultra-low dose CT protocol might affect localization characterization stone relative regular dose CT ( current protocol ) , well ability find alternate diagnosis . Incorporating additional imaging study subgroup patient observational phase allow u determine test characteristic ULDCT allow incorporation prospective phase . This hopefully provide excellent evidence implement ultra-low dose CT scan practice , ultimately lead dramatic reduction radiation exposure large number patient Yale site . We file amendment 11-15-2011 . This amendment come recent evidence work institution develop `` ultra-low dose '' CT scan protocol ( ULDCT ) effective radiation dose close plain film abdomen ( KUB ) , near 1mSv ( compare 8.5mSv current practice ) . While expect ULDCT good KUB localize characterize kidney stone , unknown loss resolution ultra-low dose CT protocol might affect localization characterization stone relative regular dose CT ( current protocol ) , well ability find alternate diagnosis . Incorporating additional imaging study subgroup patient observational phase allow u determine test characteristic ULDCT allow incorporation prospective phase . This hopefully provide excellent evidence implement ultra-low dose CT scan practice , ultimately lead dramatic reduction radiation exposure large number patient Yale sit . This amendment come recent evidence work institution develop `` ultra-low dose '' CT scan protocol ( ULDCT ) effective radiation dose close plain film abdomen ( KUB ) , near 1mSv ( compare 8.5mSv current practice ) .

Future Direction : Ultimately investigator intend implement validate decision rule study sit evaluate feasibility , physician acceptance comparative effectiveness rule . Using standard dissemination technique integration rule computerize physician order entry ( CPOE ) system institution investigator determine actual reduction number FPP CT scan order , clinical outcome base 90-day follow , survey physician acceptance rule well comparative effective analysis . The investigator submit application later date nearing end project enrollment study .</detailed_description>
