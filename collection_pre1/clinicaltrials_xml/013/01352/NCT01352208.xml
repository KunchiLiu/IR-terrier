	<brief_summary>The study three part . Part 1 dose escalation investigate safety tolerability ASP9521 . Part 2 evaluate safety tolerability initial anti-tumor activity ASP9521 . Part 3 study Food Effect study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study ASP9521 Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose first study part investigate safety tolerability ASP9521 patient Castrate Resistant Prostate Cancer . This do different dos , start low dose high dos find maximum dose tolerate . The second part investigate safety tolerability evaluate initial anti-tumor activity ASP9521 . This do multiple dos identify part 1 potentially effective . The number patient part 2 high number compare part I . The third part study investigate effect food drug patient ; crossover design fed fasted vice versa .</detailed_description>

For patient orchiectomy , must plan maintain effective LHRH agonist/antagonist therapy duration study Serum testosterone &lt; 1.7 nmol/L ( 50 ng/dL ) screening Patients receive bisphosphonates approve bone target therapy must stable dos least 4 week prior screen Progressive disease study entry define one follow 3 criterion occur set castrate level testosterone : Prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) progression define minimum 2 rise PSA level interval &gt; 1 week determination . The PSA value screen &gt; 2 ng/mL Soft tissue disease progression define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Measurable disease require entry . Lymph nod &gt; 20 mm consider measurable disease Bone disease progression define least 2 new lesion bone scan Life expectancy &gt; 6 month accord investigator 's judgment ChemotherapyNaïve patient asymptomatic control symptomatic patient metastatic CRPC fail one line hormonal treatment/androgen deprivation therapy receive chemotherapy refuse chemotherapy . Post chemotherapy patient receive two prior regimen chemotherapy prostate cancer , one docetaxelbased Concomitant treatment follow prohibit : All biologic agent ( except sipuleucel T [ Provenge® ] ) , agent antitumor activity prostate cancer , include 5 alpha reductase inhibitor , androgen ( e.g. , testosterone ) , cytoproterone acetate progestational agent , estrogen , flutamide within 4 week prior screen Bicalutamide nilutamide within 6 week prior screen Treatment estramustine Ketoconazole treatment prostate cancer Treatment abiraterone Radiation therapy treatment prostate within 3 month prior screen Radiation therapy treatment metastasis within 3 week ( single fraction radiotherapy within 2 week ) radionuclide therapy treatment metastasis within 4 week prior screen Major surgery within 2 month prior screen Known suspect intracerebral disease brain metastasis Use investigational agent within 4 week prior treatment allocation period require local regulation , whichever long Prior use , participation clinical study , investigational agent block androgen synthesis target androgen receptor</criteria>
