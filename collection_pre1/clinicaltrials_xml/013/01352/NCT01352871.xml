	<brief_summary>The innate immune response first line defense invading pathogen . Ideally , inflammatory response tightly regulate lead adequate protection invade pathogen well limitation exuberant unwanted immune response see sepsis auto-immune disease . It become increasingly clear autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) innate immune response intimately link . Activation sympathetic division ANS dampen inflammation via β2-adrenoceptors . On hand , case , sympathetic drive also stimulate inflammatory response via α2-adrenoceptors . The parasympathetic branch ANS modulate inflammatory response well , since discover electrical stimulation efferent vagus nerve rat greatly inhibit innate immune response . Generally , ANS regard pure autonomic influence behavior . However , trough special concentration/mediation technique master certain individual , might possible modulate ANS activity . In addition , recent unpublished finding indicate concentration/meditation technique also influence inflammatory response ex vivo . In study investigator wish investigate effect concentration/meditation innate immune response vivo . In addition investigator wish elucidate mechanism via effect mediate . The investigator aim use call human endotoxemia model . This model permit elucidation key player immune response gram negative stimulus vivo , therefore serve useful tool investigate potential novel therapeutic strategy standardize set . Objectives : Primary objective : The primary objective study determine effect concentration/meditation innate immune response induce lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) challenge . Secondary Objective ( ) : 1 . To determine effect concentration/meditation ANS activity . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) , heart-rate variability ( HRV ) , muscle sympathetic nerve activity plasma concentration catecholamine measure purpose . 2 . To determine concentration/meditation attenuate ( subclinical ) renal damage know occur human endotoxemia , marker proximal distal tubular damage measure various time point .</brief_summary>
