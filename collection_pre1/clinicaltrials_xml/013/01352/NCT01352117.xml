	<brief_summary>AIDS-related Kaposi 's sarcoma ( AIDS-KS ) occur person HIV infection also infect Kaposi 's sarcoma herpesvirus ( KSHV ) . Several chemotherapy ( anti-cancer ) drug work well treat KS , treatment cure KSHV infection . One chemotherapy drug call etoposide ( VePesidÂ® , ET ) cause KS tumor get small people . Antiretroviral therapy ( anti-HIV drug ART ) group medicine take together treat HIV infection . These medicine help stop HIV grow body . When happen , immune system , fight infection cancer like KS , get strong . For people , limited stage KS often improve stay take ART . However , people KS get bad take ART . These people may need chemotherapy later date . This study do find take ART immediate etoposide ( ET ) well take ART alone ART delay ET treat limit stage KS . The study also try good understand KSHV see kind side effect cause ART ET safe ART ET .</brief_summary>
