	<brief_summary>Background : - Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause vision loss individual 55 year age . It cause permanent loss central vision , important see fine detail long distance . AMD two form : wet AMD dry AMD . Most people AMD dry AMD . But dry AMD progress wet AMD . Wet AMD serious form result severe vision loss . - A method identify monitor early middle stage AMD may help researcher develop new treatment stop disease become severe . In early dry AMD , people see well night . Researchers want study whether procedure measure eye adjust dark help identify monitor early middle dry AMD . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness use dark adaptation protocol identify monitor early middle dry age-related macular degeneration . Eligibility : - People least 50 year age AMD . Others early middle dry AMD least one eye . Design : - People screen physical examination , medical history , blood urine test , full eye exam . - This study last 5 year require least 9 visit NIH . ( First visit ; study visit month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 ; 3 yearly followup visit ) . - Up 10 people ask come back clinic 1 week first visit . They ask test device use study . - Participants baseline exam . These question problem affect eye different lighting condition . - At every visit , participant answer question general health current medication ( include vitamin supplement ) . They also full eye exam 20- 40-minute test . This test measure fast eye recover response decreasing level light . The test also measure sensitive eye condition . - Participants continue test yearly followup examination . They treat standard care eye condition may develop study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This study design investigate use dark adaptation functional endpoint progression eye intermediate age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . Study Population : Two hundred ( 200 ) participant initially accrue ; however , 240 participant meet eligibility criterion may enrol . Participants vary degree severity AMD ( Groups 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) . Group 0 ( N=40 ) define participant without AMD mean large drusen ( great equal 125 micron ) advance AMD either eye . Group 1 ( N=40 ) define participant large drusen ( great equal 125 micron ) study eye large drusen advance AMD ( choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) geographic atrophy ( GA ) ) fellow eye . Group 2 ( N=40 ) define participant bilateral large drusen ( great equal 125 micron ) without retinal pigment epithelial hypo/hyperpigmentary change . Group 3 ( N=40 ) define participant large drusen ( great equal 125 micron ) study eye advance AMD ( CNV GA ) fellow eye . Up 20 diabetic participant recruit . Design : This single center , exploratory , observational , longitudinal evaluation dark adaptation response AMD participant five year long-term evaluation dark adaptometry ( DA ) change predictor AMD progression visual acuity ( VA ) loss . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome determine mean change , include distribution change , dark adaptation response baseline month 12 24 Groups 0 , 1 , 2 3 . Reproducibility evaluate minimum 10 participant repeat test perform one week ( plus minus 2 day ) follow baseline visit . The secondary outcome four group determine mean change dark adaptation response baseline month 3 , 6 , 18 , 36 , 48 60 determine mean best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) baseline month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 . Exploratory outcomes four group correlate mean BCVA study eye mean dark adaptation response baseline month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 correlate AMD severity dark adaptation response baseline month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 . This study also analyze renal function AMD participant . Additionally , exploratory analysis small sample diabetic participant also perform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants eligible follow inclusion criterion meet : Participant able understand sign protocol inform consent document . Participant able complete comply study assessment full duration study . Participant great equal 50 year age . Participant BCVA score great equal 20/100 ( Snellen equivalent ) study eye . Participant qualify one follow group base AMD grade define . Advanced AMD define Appendix 1 . Group 0 : Participant without AMD define large drusen advance AMD either eye ; Group 1 : Participant least one large drusen ( great equal 125 micron ) study eye large drusen advance AMD fellow eye ; Group 2 : Participant bilateral large drusen ( great equal 125 micron ) without retinal pigment epithelial hypo/hyperpigmentary change ; Group 3 : Participant least one large drusen ( great equal 125 micron ) study eye advance AMD fellow eye . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants meet follow criterion exclude study : Participant advance AMD ( define Appendix 1 ) study eye baseline visit . Participant active ocular macular disease ( e.g. , diabetic macular edema , retinal vein occlusion , Stargardt disease conerod dystrophy ) know ocular disorder cause visual field deficit ( e.g. , glaucoma know visual field defect ) study eye . Participant fixation deficit study eye would prevent participant perform AdaptRx dark adaptation protocol . Participant medical condition investigator feel would prevent participant comply able complete study assessment Participant cataract surgery study eye within three month prior enrollment . Participant oral intake high dos vitamin A palmitate supplement ( great equal 10,000 international unit ( IU ) per day ) . Participant hepatitis liver disease . Abnormally low vitamin A alter dark adaptation chronic liver disease associate low vitamin A . Participant history vitamin A deficiency . Participant participate AREDS2 protocol . Participant NEI employee subordinate coworker investigator .</criteria>
