	<brief_summary>The epidural spinal , relies primarily palpation anatomic landmark always easy find , More , even correct identification palpable landmark , Variability exist lead perform neuraxial injection undetermined intralaminar level . The accurate method identify interspace use fluoroscopy CT technique , exposure radiation availability make unpractical majority case . As ultrasound technology become accessible clinician , hold great potential facilitate perform neuraxial anesthesia anesthesiologist routine case . The aim study compare accuracy identify intervertebral space , manual palpation , versus ultrasound versus fluoroscopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuraxial anesthesia relies upon sound knowledge anatomy accurately direct needle placement achieve consistent success , avoid damage nearby structure . This prospective randomized study , perform pain management unit . We assess patient schedule receive epidural steroid injection . The investigator request permission fro ethic committee Hadassah Medical Hospital . Three anesthesiologist perform study , every one anesthesiologist ask identify intralaminar space one technique compare accuracy identify intralaminar space .</detailed_description>
