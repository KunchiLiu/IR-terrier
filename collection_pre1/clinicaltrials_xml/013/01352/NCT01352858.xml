	<brief_summary>This study look safety , feasibility acceptability new therapy call tolerogenic dendritic cell ( TolDC ) , derive patient 's white blood cell , inject knee joint rheumatoid arthritis patient , use procedure call arthroscopy ( camera examination joint ) . The investigator also look see drug effect disease activity ( help RA ) whether drug affect immune system . The investigator aim treat 12 patient total , 9 TolDC 3 control treatment . Three dos TolDC test , 3 patient per dose . Subjects RA least one swollen knee joint . They undergo knee ultrasound scan , fill series questionnaire , knee aspirate ( fluid take ) finally undergo procedure call leukapheresis ( removal white blood cell ) treatment manufacture . Subsequently undergo 3 arthroscopy ( camera examination knee joint ) period 12 week . On first arthroscopy TolDC inject knee joint . They spend night Clinical Research facility observation . Over next 5 day telephone daily study doctor check , reassess need . About 2 week later second arthroscopy look effect treatment , third take place 13 week ( end study ) sooner knee appear get bad .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Able willing give inform consent comply study protocol At least 6 month 's disease duration ACR Functional Class IIII Age 18 year Active disease , include inflame ( native ) knee joint Failure ( intolerance ) least one disease modify antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) , include current therapy Morning stiffness target joint ≥ 30 minute Willing able undergo arthroscopic procedure local anaesthetic Stable dose nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) corticosteroid ( prednisolone≤10mg ) ≥4 week No intramuscular glucocorticoid administration ≥ 6 week Stable dose diseasemodifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) ≥8 week Use investigational medicinal product within 30 day prior study entry ( defined date recruitment study ) Patients receive rituximab therapy whose Bcell count remain normal range . Patients receive cell deplete therapy whose cell count return normal range , discretion principal investigator . Serious unstable comorbidity deem unsuitable PI , eg . COPD , cardiac failure History malignancy ( except treat basal cell carcinoma skin ) Known active infection screen visit baseline ( except fungal nail infection ) Infection require hospitalization IV antibiotic within 6 week baseline Immunization live vaccine within 6 week baseline History recurrent chronic infection History hepatitis B C , syphilis , HIV HTLV1/2 infection Injection target joint glucocorticoid within 6 week baseline Hb &lt; 10g/dL ; neutrophil &lt; 2.00 x109/L ; platelet &lt; 150x109/L ; ALT/ALP &gt; 2x upper limit normal ; elevate serum creatinine screen visit . Major surgery within 8 week baseline plan within 3 month baseline Pregnancy , woman plan become pregnant within study period , woman breast feeding Females male child bear potential unwilling use adequate contraception duration study Patients take anticoagulant Known hypersensitivity local systemic corticosteroid therapy local anaesthetic . Poor venous access medical condition preclude leukapheresis</criteria>
