	<brief_summary>Background : - Gemcitabine carboplatin chemotherapy drug use treat several type cancer , include cancer pancreas , bladder , ovary , lung . Lenalidomide , drug prevents growth new blood vessel tumor , approve treatment certain blood cancer , yet approve use combination gemcitabine carboplatin . Researchers interested determine safe effective dose combine form chemotherapy solid tumor , particularly urothelial cancer ( tumor bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis ) . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness combine lenalidomide , gemcitabine , carboplatin treatment solid tumor cancer . - To evaluate safety effectiveness combine lenalidomide , gemcitabine , carboplatin treatment urothelial ( bladder ) cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose solid tumor respond standard treatment . - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose urothelial cancer respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , tumor image study . - Participants urothelial cancer receive lenalidomide alone first 14 day 21-day cycle start first full treatment cycle . - All participant receive gemcitabine day 1 8 , carboplatin day 1 , every 21-day treatment cycle . Lenalidomide take daily home first 14 day cycle . Participants ask take aspirin medication prevent possibility blood clot . - Participants may receive six cycle treatment combination . If six cycle cancer grow shrunk , participant may continue take lenalidomide alone additional 6 month ( total 12 month therapy ) cancer recurs . - Participants monitor blood sample , physical examination , tumor image study cycle treatment . - After end last treatment cycle , participant followup visit every 3 month next 18 month , every 6 month another 18 month , yearly ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Gemcitabine plus carboplatin accept first-line therapy patient unfit cisplatin chemotherapy metastatic urothelial carcinoma solid tumor malignancy . - Both non-clinical clinical data support target angiogenesis urothelial carcinoma solid tumor . - Both non-clinical clinical data support target immune system urothelial carcinoma solid tumor . - Lenalidomide anti-angiogenic potent immunomodulatory property . - Lenalidomide safely coadministered cytotoxic therapy patient solid tumor non-clinical study demonstrate possible synergy gemcitabine . OBJECTIVES : Primary - To establish dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide safely combine gemcitabine carboplatin patient advanced/metastatic UC solid tumor unfit cisplatin . Secondary - To preliminarily evaluate progression free survival , response rate overall survival patient advanced/metastatic UC solid tumor treat combination lenalidomide , gemcitabine , carboplatin . - To determine effect treatment set 4 laboratory parameter ( include Treg , sIL-2R , VEGF CTC . ) expansion cohort patient bladder cancer treat MTD . ELIGIBILITY : - Adult patient histologic documentation advance solid tumor unresectable metastatic disease . - Urothelial cancer patient ineligible cisplatin base one following : - Calculated creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min ( great equal 30 mL/min ) - Solitary kidney - Karnofsky Performance Status &lt; 80 % - No prior combination systemic chemotherapy metastatic disease allow patient UC , except single agent radiosensitizing chemotherapy ( consider prior systemic therapy ) , prior neoadjuvant adjuvant systemic chemotherapy ( include cisplatin-based ) allow provide complete ( Bullet ) 6 month prior diagnosis metastatic disease ; prior intravesical therapy permit . Up 1 line chemotherapy metastatic setting permit non UC patient . - Laboratory evaluation must meet safety requirement , include creatinine clearance great 30 use Cockroft-Gault formula ; may pregnant breast-feeding . DESIGN : - This single-institution phase I study gemcitabine ( 1000 mg/m2 day 1 8 ) carboplatin ( AUC 5 day 1 ) plus escalate dos lenalidomide ( GCL ) patient advanced/metastatic UC solid tumor ineligible cisplatin therapy . Lenalidomide administer daily day 1 14 every 21 day escalate dose . An expansion cohort MTD additional 15 patient bladder cancer enrol order determine whether difference pre-treatment post-treatment level follow parameter : Treg , sIL- 2R , VEGF CTC . - Patients receive total 6 cycle gemcitabine carboplatin combination lenalidomide unless disease progression unacceptable toxicity occurs . Patients achieve stable disease , partial response , complete response completion 6 cycle eligible continue lenalidomide alone dose schedule disease progression . Restaging evaluation occur every 3 cycle treatment ( approximately 9 week ) . - Based standard 3+3 design 4 dose level per cohort , maximum 24 patient , potential additional 3 patient CrCl &gt; 60 mL/min , may need evaluated determine dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide combination therapy . With expansion cohort 15 patient MTD , total 42 subject may enrol 1.5 -3 year .</detailed_description>
