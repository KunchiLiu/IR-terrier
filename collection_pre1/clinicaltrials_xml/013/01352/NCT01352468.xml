	<brief_summary>After decade Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) intervention research , two intervention approach ( i.e. , psychopharmacology , behavioral treatment ) `` well-established '' evidence-base support efficacy child ADHD . Both intervention inherent limitation . Recently multiple study demonstrate cognitive training may improve neuropsychological behavioral function child ADHD . The magnitude treatment effect cognitive training comparable treatment effect behavioral treatment ADHD ( i.e. , small moderate effect size ) . A limitation exist cognitive training program may limit efficacy employ unifaceted approach . Each intervention program target single cognitive domain ( e.g. , work memory ) . This problematic since group , child ADHD multiple area cognitive deficit ( i.e. , work memory , attention , response inhibition , delay aversion , intra-individual variability ) thus unifaceted intervention address multifaceted array cognitive dysfunction child ADHD . Also , individual ADHD unique pattern cognitive deficit , unifaceted cognitive training approach may target area non-deficient miss area significant deficit individual patient depend ideographic cognitive profile . The primary goal propose research develop test multifaceted cognitive training intervention address comprehensive array ADHD-related cognitive deficit thereby ensure child 's unique area cognitive deficit target . During Phase I ( R21 grant ) , software manual develop consist four training task target response inhibition , verbal work memory , attention , delay aversion . Each task posse advance level difficulty . On task , child receive feedback performance accuracy well intra-individual variability reaction time . The software pilot test Phase I determine performance threshold intervention duration . Also , focus group conduct obtain patient perception task 's difficulty interest level . In Phase II ( R33 grant ) , preliminary randomize clinical trial conduct order obtain initial estimate treatment efficacy . Pre- , post- , follow outcomes collect wide range neuropsychological , behavioral , academic measure . Effect size estimate across outcome use guide sample size determination future clinical trial multifaceted cognitive training .</brief_summary>
