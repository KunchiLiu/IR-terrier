	<brief_title>SGN-35 CD30-positive Lymphoproliferative Disorders ( ALCL ) , Mycosis Fungoides ( MF ) , Extensive Lymphomatoid Papulosis ( LyP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Brentuximab vedotin antibody design find certain protein ( call CD30 ) cancer cell bind . It design enter cell release molecule may kill cancer cell . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , begin receive brentuximab vedotin vein 30 minute Day 1 21-day study cycle . If side effect first dose doctor think best interest , future dos may lower delay 3 week . Premedications : If reaction infusion site receive study drug Cycle 1 , may give acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) 30-60 minute follow infusion . Study Visits : At clinic visit , include follow-up visit ( describe ) , full skin exam . You check see much skin 's surface lesion . Up 6 skin lesion select photograph measured visit . Your private area cover ( much possible ) , picture face take unless lesion face . You able identify photograph . The following test procedure also perform : On Day 1 study cycle ( receive study drug ) : - You physical exam . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect . - You fill 3 quality-of-life questionnaire . - Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status disease . - If lesion biopsy within last 6 week lesion biopsy check status disease PGx testing . Length Study Treatment : You may receive study drug 8 cycle . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . If disease complete response , may receive study drug 2 cycle study doctor think best interest . If disease complete response , come back , may receive study drug 8 cycle doctor think best interest . If good end 8 cycle disease complete remission , study doctor may allow receive study drug every 3 week full dose every 2 week low dose 8 additional cycle . If continue improvement 16 cycle , study doctor may allow continue receive study drug . The study doctor discus . Follow-up Visits : About 3-4 week stop take study drug , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - Your performance status record . - You physical exam . - You ask side effect . - You fill 3 quality-of-life questionnaire . - Blood ( 4-6 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status disease . - You CT PET scan check status disease . - You lesion biopsy check status disease PGx testing . You follow-up evaluation every 12-16 week study longer open : - You physical exam . - You ask side effect may . - Your medical history record . Long-term Follow-up : You primary doctor may contact long-term follow-up status disease , study-related nerve damage ( include loss motor sensory function ) , overall health status , study close . This investigational study . Brentuximab vedotin FDA approve commercially available use patient ALCL . It currently use LyP MF research purpose . Up 84 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must biopsy confirm diagnosis base combination histological clinical criterion CD30+ lymphomatoid papulosis , CD30+ primary cutaneous anaplastic large Tcell lymphoma ( pcALCL ) , CD30+ mycosis fungoides phase II trial . There specific limit validate amount positive cell 1HC cell tumor cell . 2 . Patients pcALCL spread systemically ( e.g . lymph node , bone marrow visceral organ ) may include long pcALCL primary diagnosis least 6 month systemic involvement confirm . MF patient must stage IB great . 3 . Systemic involvement ( i.e. , nodal , bone marrow visceral organ involvement ) evaluate CT and/or PET bone marrow biopsy ( indicated patient blood involvement ) patient pcALCL MF baseline . 4 . Patients ' biopsy must histologically confirm CD30 positive within 36 month enrollment . 5. pcALCL MF patient must progress relapsed treatment local radiation therapy , phototherapy , topical chemotherapy , fail systemic therapy least one single agent ( e.g. , methotrexate bexarotene nonCD30 antibody ) one multiagent chemotherapy ( e.g . CHOP : cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ) . pcALCL classify patient require one cutaneous tumor history present least 3 month . 6 . All patient must consider eligible candidate systemic therapy determine investigator . To eligible , LYP patient must need systemic therapy ie scar active lesion ( &gt; /=10 per month ) , number active lesion face , hand foot . 7 . Patients must follow minimum washout previous treatment : . &gt; /= 4 week local radiation therapy , systemic cytotoxic anticancer therapy , treatment anticancer investigational agent . b . &gt; 2 week oral methotrexate , retinoids biological response modifier therapy indication , topical prescription topical therapy . c. &gt; /= 12 week immunotherapy ( e.g. , monoclonal antibody ) . Patients rapidly progressive disease may treat early require washout period ; patient recover prior treatmentrelated toxicity 8 . Patients must ECOG performance status &lt; /= 2 . 9 . Patients must least 18 year age . 10 . Patients must available periodic blood sampling , studyrelated assessment , management toxicity treat institution . 11 . Females childbearing potential [ female post menopausal least 12 month surgically sterilize ] must negative betaHCG pregnancy &lt; /=7 day prior Day 1 Cycle 1 . If pregnancy test outside institutional normal range pretreatment , subject must second pregnancy test . If second pregnancy test outside institutional normal range gynecology consult need confirm subject pregnant . All patient must agree use effective contraceptive method course study . 12 . Patients must give write informed consent . A copy sign informed consent form retain patient 's chart . 13 . The following required baseline laboratory data : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1000/microliter , platelet &gt; /= 50,000/ÂµL ( unless document bone marrow involvement lymphoma ) , bilirubin &lt; /= 1.5X upper limit normal ( ULN ) &lt; /= 3X ULN patient Gilbert 's disease , serum creatinine &lt; /= 1.5X ULN , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; /= 2.5X ULN . 1 . Concomitant corticosteroid use systemic topical treatment skin disease allow except dose steroid 20 mg prednisone equivalence allow asthma , COPD IBD .Stable use topical corticosteroid midpotency allow patient erythrodermaSezary syndrome ( T4 ) tumor stage ( T3 ) intense pruritus . 2 .
