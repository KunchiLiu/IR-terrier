	<brief_summary>In majority patient osteoarthritis knee disease originate medial compartment . There two different approach replace arthritic area . Some surgeon feel always best replace knee compartment Total Knee Replacement ( TKR ) . Others feel best replace damaged component knee Unicompartmental Knee Replacement ( UKR ) . There little agreement amongst knee surgeon . Both intervention establish well documented procedure , yet little evidence exist support either practice . Each intervention consider standard care . There exist little evidence , however , prove clinical cost effectiveness either management option . The aim Total Partial Knee Arthroplasty Trial ( TOPKAT ) assess clinical cost effectiveness Total Knee Replacements versus Unicompartmental Knee Replacements patient medial osteoarthritis . This examine use appropriate patient base long term assessment . The trial combine device/expertise base allocation depend local situation . Surgeons equipoise sufficient experience perform TKR UKR , randomisation allocation base `` device '' ( UKR TKR ) . The surgeon perform operation arm study . For surgeon hold preference one treatment , `` expertise '' base randomisation occur . UKR surgeon work alongside TKR surgeon . Patients recruit study site randomise one treatment option treat appropriate surgeon . In case patient internally refer surgeon 's operating list . Patients recruit consultant knee surgeon collaboration local research team . TOPKAT hop recruit 500 patient altogether , 250 per arm trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The design study single layer multicentre superiority type randomise control trial unilateral knee replacement patient . The randomised controlled trial design help reduce prevent potential bias influence evaluation . Participants randomise either UKR TKR . The trial combine equipoise/expertise approach . It enable surgeon equipoise deliver one two operation also allow surgeon equipoise provide operation . A surgeon equipoise ( 'equipoise surgeon ' ) sufficient experience perform TKR UKR deliver allocate operation ( UKR TKR ) . The surgeon perform operation arm study . Not surgeon able exhibit equipoise . They may hold preference one treatment often due experience/expertise one type operation . Interestingly , surgeon may also believe patient may benefit one particular operation even though may able perform . Equipoise difficult investigate establish . Self declaration use main approach order sufficiently secure state follow aspect important : - The equipoise consider must patient- individual-based equipoise rather overall general category equipoise base operation type . The surgeon must consider position individual patient . Only believe either operation suitable individual patient patient recruit . - No surgeon ever knowingly perform consider substandard surgical procedure . In order complete trial seek maximise surgeon participation , 'expertise'-based delivery intervention also occur . For approach must surgeon expertise TKR surgeon expertise UKR centre act together 'delivery unit ' . Patients recruit study care surgeon ( 'expertise surgeon ' ) randomise one two group treat appropriate surgeon . This 'expertise ' approach allow UKR surgeon work alongside TKR surgeon team participate study . Subsequent surgery may carry surgeon different initial consultation . In case patient internally refer surgeon 's operating list . No restriction make upon number delivery unit within centre . A surgeon one delivery unit , , either 'equipoise surgeon ' 'expertise surgeon ' .</detailed_description>
