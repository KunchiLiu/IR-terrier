	<brief_summary>Endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) , bosentan ambrisentan , class vasoactive drug develop treatment pulmonary arterial hypertension . It anecdotally report ERA frequently use among top-level athlete counteract exercise-induced rise pulmonary vascular pressure increase exercise performance . Yet , effect ERA exercise capacity healthy human puzzle , drug include current Prohibited List , since ergogenic potential yet fully understood determine . Furthermore , urinary excretion ERA metabolites follow administration study systematically rest exercise athlete , way detect intake performance-enhancing potential confirmed . In planned study ERA administer newly approve dose 8 week order ass presume dope potential male female athlete , monitor serum urinary ERA excretion dynamic single- multiple-dose administration . The possible effect prolong ERA administration high dos exercise performance may relevant , confirm , term possible fraudulent utilization influence exercise performance sport , raise difficult question whether , particularly circumstance , ERA might consider prohibited substance athlete .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preliminary finding research group indicate ERA enhances exercise performance ( particularly aerobic ) 7-day intake high dose non-selective ERA bosentan ( dos use approve pulmonary arterial hypertension treatment ) . This part accordance result previous research ( Faoro et al . 2009 ) , although author administer regular single dose ( 62.5 mg ) bosentan hypoxic healthy subject . Our study examine metabolic profile athletes receive significantly high dos two oral ERA compare previous research , along assessment ergogenic potential 8 week administration placebo-control randomize design . We expect ERA increase time exhaustion endurance test , increase maximal oxygen uptake rate ultra-short term heart rate recovery exercise , affect blood urine cortisol , testosterone dehydroepiandrosterone follow administration . Moreover , clearly evaluate 24-h pharmacokinetic profile ERA blood urine collect data concentration-time profile ERA main active metabolite , aim provide rationale basis identification detection dope control .</detailed_description>
