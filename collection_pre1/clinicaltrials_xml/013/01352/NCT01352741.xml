	<brief_summary>The main objective study evaluate effectiveness , safety , tolerability increase dos tapentadol prolong release ( PR ) ( 500 mg per day ) versus combination tapentadol PR ( 300 mg per day ) pregabalin ( 300 mg per day ) subject require additional analgesia titration tapentadol PR 300 mg per day . This clinical effectiveness trial design establish link anticipated clinical outcome clinical practice mean select measure clinical subject report outcomes . Since , severe low back pain neuropathic component , target study population , frequently treat combination therapy ( monotherapy often effective enough ) interest determine tapentadol alone ( combine 2 mechanisms action single molecule ) could effective combination tapentadol plus pregabalin . Furthermore , tolerability profile monotherapy versus combination interest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Increasing Doses Tapentadol Versus Combination Tapentadol Pregabalin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants diagnosis chronic low back pain ( defined pain last least 3 month ) require strong analgesic ( World Health Organization [ WHO ] Step III ) judge investigator positive unclear score use painDETECT diagnostic screening questionnaire enter open-label titration tapentadol prolong release ( PR ) period . In total participant 11 plan schedule visit schedule 105 day . At Enrollment Visit [ Day -14 ( 3 14 day prior Baseline Visit ) ] inclusion exclusion criterion check evaluate participant 's eligibility trial . Participants previous analgesic start washout period three day 2 weeks.The duration washout period depend previous opioid analgesic co-analgesics respective dos , down-tapering step . Participants need washout previous analgesic treatment ( e.g . WHO Step I analgesic ) , baseline visit schedule soon clinical laboratory monitoring result available . At Baseline Visit ( Day 1 ) participant start 3 week open-label titration period tapentadol prolong release ( PR ) dose 2 x 50 mg per day titrate upwards step 100 mg ( 2 x 50 mg ) weekly basis . Participants qualify randomization may continue trial open-label continuation arm already reach satisfactory level pain relief . Participants qualify randomization comparative period ( Day 22 77 ) allocate 1 2 treatment arm continue treatment . Either continue tapentadol prolong release ( PR ) increase dos tapentadol PR - After randomization visit , participant titrate total daily dose 400 mg. - 1 week randomization visit , titrate total daily dose 500 mg . Participants treatment arm receive final dose 500 mg tapentadol PR per day . Or start combination tapentadol PR 300 mg per day pregabalin - After randomization visit , participant continue previous regimen tapentadol PR 2 x 150 mg per day plus pregabalin 2 x 75 mg ( total daily dose 150 mg pregabalin ) . - 1 week randomization visit , participant continue previous regimen ( end titration period ) tapentadol PR 2 x 150 mg per day plus pregabalin 2 x 150 mg ( total daily dose 300 mg pregabalin ) . Participants treatment arm receive final dose 300 mg tapentadol PR 300 mg pregabalin . Participants Comparative Period assign open-label pick-up arm treat stable dose tapentadol PR 300 mg per day 400 mg per day experience treatment emergent adverse event ( least possibly related investigational medicinal product ) .The open-label pick-up period theoretically start Day 29 , i.e . one week Randomization Visit . The Final Evaluation ( Day 77 ) plan take place 8 week randomization . After Final Evaluation Follow-up Period ( blind taper down/out IMP Week 12 Follow-up Visit ( Day 91 ) take place . Tapering down/out medication perform accord Summary Product Characteristics .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must diagnosis chronic low back pain ; chronic pain define pain last least 3 month . Subject 's pain must require strong analgesic ( defined World Health Organization ( WHO ) step III ) judge investigator . The painDETECT diagnostic screening questionnaire score must : `` positive '' `` unclear '' .or If subject treat stable regimen centrally act analgesic ( opioids ) and/or coanalgesics , even `` negative '' painDETECT score ( least 9 ) enrollment visit acceptable . If regular daily pretreatment WHO step II/step III opioid analgesic and/or centrally act coanalgesic : Subjects must take WHO step II step III analgesic co analgesic daily basis least 2 week prior enrollment visit . Subjects pretreated WHO step II opioid analgesic and/or centrally act coanalgesic must report average pain intensity score least 5 point ( NRS3≥5 ) last 3 day prior enrollment visit . If regular , daily pretreatment WHO step I analgesic monotherapy regular analgesic pretreatment report : Subjects must average pain intensity score least 6 point NRS3≥6 ) last 3 day prior enrollment visit . Presence concomitant painful condition low back pain could confound subject 's trial assessment selfevaluation index pain , e.g. , syndrome widespread pain fibromyalgia . Low back pain cause cancer and/or metastatic disease . Any painful procedure plan trial period ( e.g. , major surgery ) may , opinion investigator , affect effectiveness safety assessment Investigational Medicinal Product ( IMP ) . Pending litigation application insurance/governmental benefit due chronic pain disability , grant , benefit might influence successful participation trial .
