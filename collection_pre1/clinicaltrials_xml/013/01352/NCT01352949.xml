	<brief_summary>Background : - Stereophotogrammetry ( SP ) use four set digital camera generate three-dimensional computer image . Unlike type evaluation require radiation , SP use computer image learn physical deformity scoliosis placement fat body . To refine SP process , researcher interest collect image body data individual skeletal structural problem scoliosis chest wall deformity , individual overweight obese , healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To use stereophotogrammetry study different individual body type refine exist image technique . Eligibility : - Individuals least 2 year age spine , rib , chest wall deformity ; overweight obese ( body mass index great 25 ) ; healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants screen physical examination medical history . The physical examination include measurement range motion joint mobility , torso width length , observational data . - Healthy volunteer participant obesity group also bioelectric spectroscopy ( bioimpedance ) , use additional machine measure fat spread different part body . - After physical examination complete , participant SP photograph take . Participants ask remove clothing torso , stand arm raise center four camera , remain still several image take . A complete image take less 1 second . - Participants spine rib deformity , obesity group , may also volunteer return followup SP imaging , year 5 year , study progress time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The primary objective project determine outcome measure derive analysis SP image reliable within healthy population distinguish healthy volunteer scoliosis , chest wall deformity , obesity . Secondary objective include compare SP outcome measure clinical radiographic measure test concurrent validity determine SP outcome measure correlate clinical radiographic measure take time . The ultimate goal develop SP measurement tool employ clinical research involve study scoliosis , rib chest deformity truncal distribution adiposity . STUDY POPULATION : The population study consist healthy volunteer , person scoliosis and/or chest wall deformity , person obesity . Men woman race , ethnicity , age great two year may participate . DESIGN : This project carry three phase . In Phase I , analyze image healthy volunteer capture SP scoliosis chest-wall deformity ( scoliosis ) software identify outcome measure show minimal variance . We also examine healthy volunteer gender , age , height , BMI contribute difference outcome measure . In Phase IIa , image capture subject scoliosis and/or chest wall deformity process scoliosis software determine set meaningful variable ( show significant difference two population ) . In Phase IIb , image capture healthy volunteer process use obesity software determine set variable show minimal variance among data healthy volunteer control effect potential confounders . Variables continue minimal variance consider meaningful respect obesity analysis software . Those variable achieve obesity image analysis compare set healthy volunteer determine variable show significant difference healthy volunteer obese subject . In Phase III , healthy participant , scoliosis/chest wall deformity , obesity participant schedule return NIH part another NIH protocol invite return yearly re-imaging total five year order analyze change time compare concurrent radiographic measure . OUTCOME MEASURES : The purpose study develop outcome measure use future research . These outcome measure develop software analyzes image derive stereophotogrammetry system .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All subject great 2 year age , gender , ethnicity eligible long cooperate physical examination imaging procedure . Subjects must able stand independently image . This limit enrollment subject 2 year age old . Subjects must agree capture image bare torso waist Healthy volunteer must without scoliosis , chest wall deformity , BMI overweight range . For adult , BMI must less equal 25 . BMI child adolescent correct accord guideline designate Centers Disease Control Prevention find Appendices 2 ( boy ) 3 ( girl ) . Adults BMI less equal 25 child adolescent adjust BMI overweight range AND image confirm scoliosis and/or chest wall deformity recruit participant NIH intramural protocol refer outside physician eligible participate phase IIa study . Adults ( subject 18 year age old ) , must either present previously obtain clinical stand scoliosis xray film date 12 month prior study visit obtain scoliosis series xray National Institutes Health Clinical Center provide confirmation scoliosis . Therefore , xrays may do research purpose adult prior image indication scoliosis series xray film take within last 12 month . Children must present previously obtain clinical stand scoliosis film date six month prior study visit provide radiological confirmation scoliosis . No xrays do research purpose . Volunteers undergone spinal fusion surgery must show postoperative film show instrumentation intact desire spinal fusion occur . Xrays may do research purpose adult prior image indication scoliosis xray series film take within last 12 month . Subjects BMI great 25 ( child adolescent define accord Centers Disease Control Prevention guideline `` overweight '' ) AND without deformity torso eligible participate phase IIb , obesity portion study . Subjects deformities torso OR BMI great 25 may eligible participate Phase IIIa IIIb follow yearly course five year Subjects scoliosis and/or chest wall deformity follow course five year must provide clinically obtain film least difference year current previous film . In adult , curve change , clinically indicated get followup film subsequent scoliosis xray film may take NIH CC . Those require clinical film include scoliosis/chest wall deformity group follow time . For subject BMI great 25 , volunteer invite followed time use SP change body composition time ( yet attain physical maturity , participate weight loss program , report significant weight gain ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects unable tolerate point torso marked surgical ink marker Subjects contact respiratory isolation status Women childbearing age find pregnant urinalysis able participate healthy volunteer phase IIa ( scoliosis participant ) require scoliosis xray series film take NIH obesity group due contraindication participation bioelectric spectroscopy test . Pregnant woman may , however , participate scoliosis section study meet relevant inclusion criterion . ( get xrays take theNIH ) Subjects pacemakers electrical conducting metal medical device implant torso able participate normal volunteer obesity group due contraindication participation bioelectric spectroscopy test . Subjects electrical conduct metal medical device arm legs limit one side body able participate normal volunteer obesity group cause data distortion bioelectric spectroscopy test . Subjects unable tolerate stroboscopic camera flash Subjects employees/staff NIH Clinical Center Rehabilitation Medicine Department .</criteria>
