	<brief_summary>The study conduct people take first anti-HIV drug regimen ( include Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , type anti-HIV drug ) drug regimen good job fight HIV infection . The main purpose study compare two anti-HIV drug regimen see well fight HIV . The study also look well participant tolerate drug regimen safe . The study design determine whether take combination lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) plus raltegravir ( RAL ) work well usually use second-line therapy : LPV/r plus best-available nucleoside ( nucleotide ) reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) combination . Testing regimen include NRTIs important NRTIs may longer work patient receive part first treatment regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Options Second-Line Effective Combination Therapy ( SELECT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As HIV-infected person start antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) worldwide , number need second-line therapy increase . In many setting , NNRTI-based regimen prefer first-line ART , whereas protease inhibitor ( PI ) -based regimen often reserve second-line ART . Both type regimens usually include two NRTIs . As initial ART , second-line regimen ideally compose three fully active drug potent anti-HIV activity maximize chance durable viral suppression . However , goal may achieve second-line PI-based regimen contain NRTIs resistance mutation first-line therapy reduce activity NRTI class . The significant mutation include M184V , thymidine analogue mutation ( TAMs ) , Q151M complex , K65R . The presence K65R would result resistance NRTIs ( leave zidovudine ( ZDV ) possibly abacavir ( ABC ) active second-line option ) ; presence multiple TAMs and/or Q151M alone complex mutation would also result resistance NRTIs . Recent data suggest patient isolate M184V-related NRTI resistance subsequently switch boost PI plus lamivudine ( 3TC ) - emtricitabine ( FTC ) -based regimen may achieve HIV-1 RNA suppression without need switch complex regimens [ 1 ] . Detection isolate M184V NRTI mutation possible resource allow early diagnosis virologic failure . However , many resource-limited setting ( RLS ) early diagnosis virologic failure difficult infrequent monitor viral load unavailability viral load test . This study intend provide information applicable vast majority RLS resistance test use routinely selection second-line regimen PIs need refrigeration prefer . This phase III , dual-arm , open-label , randomize , non-inferiority study participant fail NNRTI-containing first-line regimen . The study evaluate difference virologic failure rate two treatment arm : Arm A : LPV/r plus RAL Arm B : LPV/r plus best available NRTIs Best available NRTI combination select site investigator prior randomization list combination approve study consultation A5273 Clinical Management Committee ( CMC ) . The NRTIs provide study FTC/TDF , ABC/3TC/ZDV , ABC/3TC , 3TC/ZDV , ABC , 3TC , ZDV . Participants take assign study therapy 96 week follow-up 52 week last participant enrol ( protocol amendment ) , whichever early . This study originally plan enroll 600 participant ( 300 per study arm ) , sample size re-evaluated 480 participant ( 240 per study arm ) , due emergent data study . Participants assign equal probability one two treatment regimen use permuted block . Randomization stratify three factor : screen HIV-1 RNA ( ≥100,000 versus &lt; 100,000 copies/mL ) ; screen CD4+ cell count ( ≥100 versus &lt; 100 cells/mm3 ) , selection ZDV NRTI regimen ( yes/no ) . Furthermore , randomization balance site . During study , participant ask return clinic Weeks 4 , 12 , 24 , every 12 week . Visits last 30 minute . At visit , participant physical exam , arm , waist hip circumference measure , answer question medical condition medication take . At visit , participant complete questionnaire see feeling , hospitalize recently , well take anti-HIV drug , blood drawn ask give urine sample . If participant female able become pregnant , pregnancy test take visit pregnancy suspect .</detailed_description>
