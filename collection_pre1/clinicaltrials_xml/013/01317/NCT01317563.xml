	<brief_title>Antioxidant Therapy Lean Obese Asthmatics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma &amp; Obesity grow public health crisis also may critically interrelate many patient . Obesity increase risk asthma adult child , obesity increase severity exist asthma . Obesity lead increase systemic oxidative stress , however little know obesity-related oxidative stress within airway . Since oxidative stress contributes pathogenesis asthma , obesity may influence asthma risk severity mechanism . Asthmatics low serum antioxidant activity . There conflict evidence whether antioxidant supplementation reduces asthma severity . This may relate asthma 's heterogeneous nature . Antioxidant supplementation may effective select subgroup great oxidative stress , asthmatic occupational exposure obesity . In fact , evidence support antioxidant supplementation asthma involve subject oxidant-related trigger . We hypothesize obesity-related oxidant stress put asthmatic risk increase airway oxidative stress great asthma severity . We hypothesize supplementation common antioxidant significantly reduce airway inflammation oxidative stress , lead improve pulmonary function daily asthma control . This pilot study design randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , parallel intervention trial involve lean obese adolescent young adult asthma . After 2-week run-in period , subject undergo baseline testing ( see figure 1 ) . At randomization receive either placebo multivitamin antioxidant 42 day . At end 42 day intervention subject undergo final testing . Primary Hypothesis : In young asthmatic , antioxidant supplementation increase plasma airway antioxidant level lead improve lung function asthma control . Secondary Hypotheses : 1 ) Obesity-related systemic oxidant stress associate increase oxidative stress within airway . 2 ) Antioxidant supplementation lead great improvement asthma control among obese compare lean ( underweight ) asthmatic . 3 ) Antioxidant supplementation lead great improvement airway marker inflammation oxidative stress among obese compare lean asthmatic . We assess asthma control lung function therapy .</detailed_description>
