	<brief_summary>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) serious health problem increase dramatically worldwide due high increase prevalence obesity . Medical management T2DM limit success . Because well control T2DM patient high risk blindness , cardiovascular accident end stag disease , T2DM become major health burden society . Recent data relative effectiveness gastrointestinal metabolic surgery play bariatric surgery remission T2DM , suggest may significantly effective current medical treatment . In consider less half T2DM patient achieve satisfactory treatment goal current medical treatment , gastrointestinal metabolic surgery shall play important role T2DM treatment future . However , indication metabolic surgery clinical predictor success clear . These clinical predictor help u choose appropriate not-well control T2DM patient receive metabolic surgery reduce dverse health outcome patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asian Diabetes Surgery Study ( ADSS ) : Clinical Predictor Success Metabolic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present research proposal design assess clinical predictor success T2DM patient receive metabolic surgery treatment diabetes . This study recruit 200 obese T2DM patient receive gastrointestinal metabolic surgery center follow one year . The Inclusion criterion T2DM 6 month , age 18 65 HbA1C &gt; 8 % . All pre-operative clinical parameter collect prospectively , include C-peptide stimulated C-peptide . The genetic polymorphism patient also analyze collect . The success T2DM remission assess 12 month metabolic surgery composite endpoint CVD risk factor resolution ; specifically , proportion patient HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % . The clinical predictor analyze uni-vriate muti-variate analysis . In first year project , include 100 patient include another 100 patient second year . This project apply budget 1st year .</detailed_description>
