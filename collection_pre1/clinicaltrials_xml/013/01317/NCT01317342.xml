	<brief_summary>The purpose study , phase II randomize trial , test newly develop machine perfusion technique human liver allograft transplantation . Ischemia-reperfusion injury universal organ transplantation lead vary degree graft dysfunction . Despite fact , preservation method organ transplantation leave unchanged many year remain simple static cold storage . Given scarce donor supply , increase number call marginal extend criterion donor organ use liver transplantation , graft previously rarely consider . In addition , allocation policy change many country , liver currently often distribute severity recipient 's disease . As result , transplant candidate present sicker , high MELD ( Model end stage liver disease ) score , time transplant , risk graft dysfunction even failure due reperfusion injury high use marginal liver sick recipient . Machine liver perfusion technique significantly improve past decade decrease reperfusion injury , number promising result show beneficial effect various animal transplant model either normothermic hypothermic oxygenate continuous liver perfusion . These technique generally require machine liver perfusion immediately organ procurement . However , continuous perfusion several drawback , include major logistic effort risk organ damage perfusion transport . Our group , therefore , focus practicability machine liver perfusion . We develop endischemic hypothermic oxygenate perfusion ( HOPE ) concept portal vein . This technique easily applied operation room shortly transplantation recipient , thus organ transport back table preparation . Recently , beneficial effect similar approach confirm human liver graft phase I non randomized trial . These result prove feasibility safety endischemic hypothermic machine perfusion approach warrant randomize study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypothermic Oxygenated Perfusion ( HOPE ) Human Liver Grafts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist two group , perfusion group control group . Patients wait list liver transplantation proven write consent recruit randomized organ procurement . Randomization perform computer ( www.randomizer.at ) . Perfusion start operation room regular organ procurement , transport back table preparation . The perfusion procedure delay implantation due fact recipient hepatectomy usually take 2 hour . During procedure , hypothermic oxygenate perfusion ( HOPE group ) one hour perform vs continue cold storage ( Control group ) . We use commercially available approve IGL solution ( Institut George Lopez ) perfusate machine perfusion . Subjects follow one year transplantation . Interim Analysis : Interim analysis take perform safety ethical purpose . As soon reach 20 patient per randomize group , data analyze independent Data Monitoring Committee . The trial immediately stop one follow satisfy : 1 . Efficacy : If mean ALT level statistically significantly high ( p &lt; 0.001 , Student 's T-test ) HOPE group compare Control group . 2 . Safety : If proportion complication ( Grade â‰¥ III ) statistically significantly high ( p &lt; 0.05 , Fischer 's Exact 2-sided Test ) HOPE group compare Control group . Subgroup analysis : A subgroup analysis perform term adjust extend criterion donor graft .</detailed_description>
