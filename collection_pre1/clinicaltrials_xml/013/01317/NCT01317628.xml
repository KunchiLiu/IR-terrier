	<brief_summary>Researchers note active smoke exposure possibly relate epigenetic mechanism , may influence reactive immunotoxicological reaction human being . Some study report smoking reduction would decrease prevalence respiratory symptom urinary cotinine level , underlie epigenetic mechanism functional change immunotoxicological system still unclear . We plan examine causal relationship smoke reduction alteration epigenetic signatures/immunotoxicological reaction . Teenager Smoking Reduction Trial ( TSRT ) population-based trial among teenager . Eligible teenager recruit Taipei City urinary cotinine level use monitor exposure status active smoking baseline , 1-month 3-month intervention process . We assess potential change immunotoxicological marker , include Th1/Th2 cytokine clinical immunological measurement , intervention program . Furthermore , whole-genome methylation miRNA expression microarrays use search candidate gene teenager smoke exposure . We plan develop prediction model immunotoxicological reaction utilize epigenetic signature data microRNA expression DNA methylation profile base machine learn methodology . We also establish personalize epigenetic prediction model allergy development build risk assessment platform immunotoxicological reaction tobacco smoke exposure . Finally , examine causal relationship epigenetic signature immunotoxicological reaction independent child 's cohort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Teenager Smoking Reduction Trial ( TSRT ) 1 . Study subject TSRT solution-oriented trial aim evaluate effectiveness tobacco smoke reduction among teenager . Eligible teenager fit follow criterion : ( ) age 12 16 year old ; ( b ) active smoke habit past 6 month ; ( c ) amount smoke exceed 10 cigarette per week . The subject recruit previous database schoolchildren . Telephone interview use screen eligibility teenager . Recruitment occur 3-month period 2011 April June . The procedure TSRT show figure 2 . In plan , recruit least 31 asthmatic child 31 non-asthmatic child active smoke habit . 2 . Data collection A baseline data 1-month 2-month follow-up visit , primary caregiver provide data personal interview parent report . The demographic information questionnaire include age , gender , level education . Teenagers report frequency cigarette smoke use structured questionnaire . The definition tobacco smoke exposure include : ( ) `` Do currently smoke ? ''-yes/no ; ( b ) `` When begin smoke regularly ? '' ; ( c ) Smokers also ask number cigarette smoked average day . Nicotine dependence examine use structure questionnaire Fagerstrom model . We contact eligible teenager individually get informed consent data collection . The effect teenager smoke reduction intervention program assess primary outcome cotinine/creatinine ratio ( CCR ) status tobacco smoke exposure questionnaire . No matter group participant belongs , intervention usual control group , secondary outcome participant test follow : 1 . Cytokines . We test level interleukin 4 , 5 , 13 ( IL-4 , 5 , 13 ) , tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF-α ) , interferon-gamma ( INF-γ ) toll-like receptor 2 , 4 , 9 ( TLR-2 , 4 , 9 ) . 2 . Immunotoxicological reaction . We determine level exhale nitric oxide ( eNO ) , serum eosinophil cationic protein ( ECP ) absolute eosinophil count ( AEC ) . 3 . Oxidative stress marker . Levels marker 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , malondialdehyde ( MDA ) F2-isoprostane ( Iso-P ) examine . After first session apply , participant test primary outcome secondary outcome baseline , month 1 month 3 intervention process . We compare biomarkers intervention program .</detailed_description>
