	<brief_title>A Study TRU-016 Combination With Rituximab Bendamustine Subjects With Relapsed Indolent Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study plan conduct 2 part : Phase 1b component design determine safe dose regimen , Phase 2 component design evaluate efficacy BRT compare BR subject relapse indolent lymphoma . The Phase 2 component conduct . This open-label , non randomize , multiple-dose escalation study determine MTD BRT determine safe dose regimen combination subject relapse indolent lymphoma . The study consist screening period last 21 day , treatment period last 6 cycle ( 28 day ) , 60-day follow-up period . Up 12 subject ( 2 cohort 6 subject ) plan enrollment . Two dose level ( 10 20 mg/kg ) TRU-016 combine rituximab 375 mg/m2 bendamustine 90 mg/m2 evaluate 6 cycle ( 28 day ) . TRU-016 administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion Days 1 15 cycle . Rituximab administer IV infusion Day 2 cycle . Bendamustine administer IV infusion Days 1 2 cycle . Subjects receive study treatment 6 cycle .</detailed_description>
