	<brief_title>Oral Green Tea Extract Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Small-cell lung cancer account 13 15 % lung cancer 60 70 % patient present extensive disease ( ED ) . Although etoposide plus cisplatin ( EP ) regimen mainstay ED-SCLC treatment , median overall survival 9 month , 5 10 % survive two year 1 % patient achieve long-term disease-free survival . To improve outcome , various attempt make , include dose intensification stem cell support , maintenance therapy , also search well chemotherapy regimen . Significant anticarcinogenic effect green tea extract various organ , skin , stomach , duodenum , colon , liver , pancreas , lung rodent model confirm . Recent scientific investigation identify active chemical compound green tea designate tea polyphenols catechin . Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ( EGCG ) major catechin tea.An investigation effect EGCG human SCLC cell reveal EGCG similar anti-tumor effect drug-sensitive ( H69 ) drug-resistant ( H69VP ) SCLC cell . Thus , investigator conduct phase I trial , objectives trial study side effect best dose EGCG treat patient small-cell lung cancer achieve objective tumor response first-line therapy .</detailed_description>
