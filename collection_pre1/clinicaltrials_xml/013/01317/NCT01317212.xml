	<brief_summary>High-grade glioma common primary malignant brain tumour adult , affect approximately 5000 people per year UK . Standard treatment comprise combination surgery , radiotherapy chemotherapy ; however condition remain incurable average survival approximately 18 month diagnosis . There number reason . Firstly tumours highly invasive involve important area brain making impossible remove surgically cure radiotherapy . In majority case tumour recurs within 2 3cm original site tumour removal . Secondly , due presence barrier bloodstream brain , drug design kill tumour cell ( chemotherapy ) give intravenously orally , frequently reach tumour sufficient dose beneficial effect . As chemotherapy dose high sufficient dose reach tumour , drug-related side-effects common . Laboratory study demonstrate glioma tumour cell sensitive number different chemotherapy , include carboplatin . When give intravenously however , carboplatin reach sufficient concentration tumour beneficial effect . However , study show carboplatin infuse directly brain concentration highly toxic tumour cell , normal brain tissue . Using small tube implant around tumour , investigator able infuse carboplatin reliably repeatedly area tumour typical recur . In study , investigator intend evaluate safety approach determine optimal dose carboplatin administer . It hop study also provide evidence improved survival patient high-grade glioma .</brief_summary>
