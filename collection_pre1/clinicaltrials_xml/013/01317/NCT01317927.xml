	<brief_title>A Study Belinostat Combination With Warfarin Patients With Solid Tumors Hematological Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single center , pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study patient solid tumor hematological malignancy . Upon provide informed consent satisfy screening procedure , eligible subject report clinic Part I study 14 day first dose belinostat ( Day -14 ) clinical laboratory test , warfarin ( 5mg ) single dose series PK collection . On day 1-5 21-day cycle patient receive belinostat 1000mg/m*2 series subsequent PK sample collect . On day 3 cycle 1 , patient also receive warfarin 5mg single dose prior belinostat infusion . PK sample , urine sample , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) safety measurement collect Day 1 Day 10 cycle one . If interest patient , belinostat continue Part II- extension phase 5 additional cycle belinostat treatment day 1-5 subsequent cycle , disease progression , patient withdraws consent unacceptable toxicity occur . During extension phase routine physical exam , laboratory test safety efficacy assessment perform . Disease evaluation conduct per standard care . Patients discontinue reason disease progression follow new anti-cancer treatment initiate death .</detailed_description>
