	<brief_summary>Preoperative diagnosis pancreatic cystic lesion remain difficult problem clinical practice . At present , treatment planning pancreatic cystic neoplasm significantly restrict limited preoperative diagnosis . Ultrasonography ( US ) , multidetector compute tomography ( MDCT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) conventional modality image pancreatic cystic neoplasm , method diagnostic accuracy still remain compromised . Furthermore , recently encourage result obtain pancreatic cystic neoplasm use 18F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18F-FDG-PET ) The aim current project evaluate possibility enhance diagnostic accuracy use combine 18F-FDG-PET-CT imaging patient pancreatic cystic neoplasm combine PET-CT MRI MDCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET-CT Diagnosis Pancreatic Cystic Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today , clinical practice diagnosis pancreatic cystic neoplasm base MDCT , MRI ERCP follow surgical exploration . The information gain conventional imaging modality restrict morphological detail , usually insufficient definitive staging pancreatic cystic neoplasm . Based previous study , seem PET especially combine CT modality could improve diagnostic accuracy pancreatic cystic lesion . So far , case publish concern role 18F-FDG-PET-CT differential diagnosis cystic pancreatic lesion . Therefore , study need determine role combine 18F-FDG-PET-CT diagnosis pancreatic cystic lesion . The aim current project evaluate possibility enhance diagnostic accuracy use combine 18F-FDG-PET-CT imaging patient pancreatic cystic neoplasm combine PET-CT MRI MDCT . The study consist 20-30 patient pancreatic cystic neoplasm . The patient enrol study image MDCT , MRI combine magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) 18F-FDG-PET-CT follow surgery follow-up . The data collect 2011 2013 .</detailed_description>
