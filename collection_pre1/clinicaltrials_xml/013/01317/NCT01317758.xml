Hospitalized psychiatric illness , history suicide attempt , confinement danger self others since receipt Dose 1 . New occurrence new awareness GuillainBarré Syndrome since receipt Dose 1 . Any unresolved continuing solicit unsolicited Grade 2 great severity adverse event , include reactogenicity event , occur since receipt Dose 1 without clear , alternative etiology . Unresolved continue Grade 1 adverse event permissible unless , opinion site principal investigator appropriate subinvestigator , would render vaccination unsafe , would interfere evaluation response generally see `` normal , healthy subject '' . Grade 2 great severity clinical safety lab value ( accord toxicity table , Section 11.1.1.2 ) return Grade 1 less prior second vaccination . If clinical safety lab value return Grade 1 less , vaccination reschedule within acceptable window second vaccination see Section 10.3.3 . Subjects experience Grade 3 clinical safety laboratory adverse event since receipt Dose 1 exclude receipt second vaccination . Subjects Grade 3 clinical safety laboratory adverse event prior first vaccination evaluate site principal investigator DMID Medical Monitor determine receipt second vaccination . Have acute illness , include oral temperature great equal 100.4 degree F , within 3 day prior second vaccination . Vaccination subject defer acute illness , include oral temperature great equal 100.4 degree F , resolve . If resolution occur , vaccination reschedule within acceptable window second vaccination see Section 10.3.3 . Emergence Grade 2 great severity sign symptom since receipt Dose 1 could confound confuse assessment vaccine reactogenicity . Any new clinical finding since receipt Dose 1 , opinion site principal investigator appropriate subinvestigator , would compromise safety subject would interfere evaluation response successful completion study . Plan travel outside U.S. time second vaccination 21 day follow second vaccination . Subject refuse vaccination . Subjects receive second vaccination ask return safety assessment schedule venous blood sample collection clinical safety laboratory immunogenicity evaluation follow duration study see protocolspecific Manual Procedures ( MOP ) detail . Subject withdraws consent . The subject may withdraw consent study participation time reason , without penalty .</criteria>
