	<detailed_description>Abnormal long-range connectivity brain area correspond impaired synchronization oscillatory rhythms neuronal network represent important pathophysiological mechanism underlie schizophrenia . Although schizophrenia consider neurodevelopmental disorder mechanism abnormal neural circuitry communication develop onset clinical symptom unknown . This project aim investigate relationship disturbed neural synchronization cognitive deficit prodromal phase schizophrenia intend identify patient increase risk develop schizophrenia . Present approach describe subject risk psychosis base clinical feature completely convince since psychiatric symptom prodromal phase often unspecific . Recent study suggest detect cognitive deficit might help precise identification high risk subject . However , underlie neurophysiological mechanism yet investigate sufficiently . Precise identification subject high risk switch schizophrenia would important since interventional strategy medical treatment even second generation antipsychotic completely free risk therefore limited subject maximal benefit . In project subject risk psychosis investigate electroencephalography ( EEG ) , magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging ( EEG-fMRI ) . Follow investigation perform switch schizophrenia occur . Neural synchronization prefrontal cortex hippocampal formation investigate use work memory paradigm . Here , different level memory load investigate use n-back paradigm . Earlier study show disturbed functional effective connectivity hippocampus prefrontal cortex patient schizophrenia subject risk . Neural synchronization prefrontal cortex sensory area investigate different attentional paradigm . Here , tone present responded button press . Earlier study demonstrate disturbed auditory evoke gamma oscillation patient schizophrenia unaffected sibling . Neural oscillation record 64-channel EEG localize mean simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Integration EEG fMRI perform use single-trial couple order detect brain region involve specific oscillatory rhythm . Using paradigm , neural long-range synchronization analyze . In addition , dynamic causal model use characterization functional relationship among brain region involve . The investigator expect functional relationship cognitive deficit subject prodromal schizophrenia subject first episode schizophrenia regard long range neural synchronization . In addition , investigator expect identify subject high risk schizophrenia analysis disturb long range synchronization .</detailed_description>
