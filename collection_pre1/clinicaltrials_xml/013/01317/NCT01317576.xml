	<brief_summary>Due western lifestyle , correlate high calorie intake low physical activity , obesity become major health problem . All world obesity reach epidemic proportion . Obesity closely link type 2 diabetes , multi-factorial disease increase presence multiple health problem . Until , exercise dietary intervention seem single effective intervention treat obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus . In obesity type 2 diabetes , fat accumulation adipose tissue , also fat accumulation peripheral tissue occur . Fat accumulation peripheral tissue associate insulin resistance . Exercise seem positive effect accumulation fat peripheral tissue insulin sensitivity type 2 diabetic patient . In study want investigate prolong exercise training program lower intrahepatic lipid content improve metabolism liver type 2 diabetic patient patient non-alcoholic fatty liver disease , examine lead improvement metabolic risk marker . To end , include investigation effect exercise adipose tissue ( inflammatory marker adipocyte size ) skeletal muscle ( ex vivo lipid metabolism ) incorporate effect exercise liver , muscle adipose tissue clarify crosstalk tissue pathophysiology type 2 diabetes .</brief_summary>
