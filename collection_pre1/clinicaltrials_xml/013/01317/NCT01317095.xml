	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct research compare two different method closure sternum cardiac surgery determine one method well . Open heart surgery always require sternotomy , end surgery sternum need close . The sternum close Stainless Steel Wires Sternalock rigid sternal closure system equivocal result ; however , outcomes two method never investigate randomize study . Thus , investigator conduct study compare two different method closure one method demonstrate recovery benefit , use randomize subject 1:1 either rigid fixation Sternalock stainless steel wire closure . Recover benefit measure postoperative intubation time , length intensive care unit stay , overall postoperative length stay</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Sternal Closure After Open Heart Surgery : Rigid Versus Wire Closure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Subjects : Inclusion criterion : 1. schedule ( elective urgent ) coronary artery bypass graft without valvular surgery cardiothoracic surgery division . 2. patient age ≥18 &lt; 80 . 3. patient undergo elective surgery . 4. patient undergo urgent surgery ( define surgery schedule patient hospital perform hospital admission stable medical condition ) 5. patient willing sign inform consent participate study . Pre- operative exclusion criterion : 1. patient undergo redo-sternotomy . 2. patient undergo emergent surgery ( define life-threating unstable condition require surgery day surgical consultation . ) 3. patient dialysis 4. patient undergoing ventricular assist device insertion , transplant surgery , aortic surgery . 5. patient body mass index ≥ 40 . 6. patient active endocarditis . 7. patient know metal allergy . 8. patient refuse consent . 9. patient unable follow postoperative instruction . Intraoperative exclusion criterion : 1. osteoporosis poor quality sternum . 2. unstable sternal fracture . 3. sternum thin ( le 4 mm ) thick ( great 14 mm ) determine direct measurement . 4. bilateral mammary artery harvest ( cause poor blood supply sternum ) . 5. patient chest need leave open due medical reason . 2 . Procedures : Preoperative testing , medical evaluation , cardiac surgery postoperative care perform per standard care . The patient sign separate consent open heart surgery . Baseline screening : Medical history preoperative testing review determine patient suitable candidate study . If patient meet inclusion criterion , study explain two closure method discuss ; explain method sternal closure determine randomization choose participate study . If still want participate , consent sign . Randomization procedure : On day heart surgery , subject randomize 1:1 either closure stainless steel wire rigid closure Sternalock System open envelope operating room . After randomization , patient meet intraoperative exclusion criterion patient exclude study . Data collection : Ventilator time , length intensive care unit stay length hospital stay collect . Daily 6 pain VAS ( visual analog score ) score collect patient hospitalize . Complications sternal infection , sternal dehiscence , pneumonia monitor . Follow-up visit : At routine postoperative follow-up visit , usually occur 4-8 week surgery , sternal stability pain score assess . 3 . Data analysis : Plan 2 group comparison use student t-tests chi-square test perform identify factor contribute intubation time , ICU stay hospital stay . Univariate analysis follow multivariate analysis identify independent risk factor perform statistical package ( JMP software )</detailed_description>
