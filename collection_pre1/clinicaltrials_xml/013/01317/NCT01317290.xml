	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate accumulation n-3 LC-PUFA ( EPA , DPA DHA ) human lipids oral supplementation ALA-rich linseed oil . In addition , accumulation n-3 LC-PUFA compare subpopulation different age , gender physiological condition ( overweight , increase serum total cholesterol ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>N-3 PUFA important human health nutrition . Unfortunately , land-based n-3 ALA limit precursor formation n-3 LC-PUFA . The conversion ALA depend rate-limiting âˆ†6-desaturation . The first objective study investigate difference accumulation n-3 LC-PUFA ( EPA , DPA DHA ) human lipids supplementation ALA-rich linseed oil dependent age , gender physiological condition ( overweight , increase serum total cholesterol ) . One study group receive fish oil mainly EPA positive control . The second objective compare n-3 LC-PUFA enrichment linseed oil supplementation ( study LSEP H50-KK ) n-3 LC-PUFA enrichment Echium oil supplementation ( study LSEP H42-KK ) . The second study control first study . Therefore , plan recruit subject linseed oil supplementation . Eighty volunteer recruit allocate four study group depend age BMI . Three group ( n=20 ) receive daily ca . 15 g linseed oil ( mean age : 25 55 year ; mean BMI &lt; 25 ; mean age 55 BMI &gt; 25 ) . One group ( n=20 ) receive n-3PUFA free olive oil ( mean age 25 55 , BMI &lt; 25 ) . The double-blind , randomize , parallel-designed study start two-weeks run-in period , follow eight-weeks supplementation period . After run-in period , one week eight week oil supplementation blood drawn 24-h urine sample . Altogether , fatty acid distribution Echium oil linseed oil supplementation similar subject statistically analyse .</detailed_description>
