	<brief_summary>Many adolescent acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) find low bone density end treatment . This lead long-term suffering survivor due poor bone health . Vitamin D know associate bone health previous research establish Vitamin D insufficiency common diagnosis ALL worsen course treatment . Researchers also learn relationship exists Vitamin D fat tissue ALL fat tissue . In adolescent treat ALL well early survivor , randomize study therefore examine effect Vitamin D calcium supplementation correct Vitamin D insufficiency improve bone density context change body composition body fat . Bone density measure radiology exam call quantitative compute tomography ( `` qCT '' ) body composition body fat measure different radiology exam call dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( `` DEXA '' scan ) . The study also examine depth relationship three element - Vitamin D insufficiency , obesity , ALL - impact bone density .</brief_summary>
