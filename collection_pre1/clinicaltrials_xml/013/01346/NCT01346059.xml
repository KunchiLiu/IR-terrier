Every day patient blood draw check white blood cell count current practice . The patient also vancomycin trough level check via blood test . This occur prior first dose treatment day number 3 . This blind lab value unblind investigator . At resolution Patients undergo repeat colonoscopy decrease diarrhea ( le 3 stool daily ) normalize white blood cell count day 7 symptom persist . The expected length treatment approximately 7 day . If improvement fourteen day , trial stop futility .
