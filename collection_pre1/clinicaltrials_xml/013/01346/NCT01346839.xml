	<brief_summary>Diagnostic delay ambulatory care often due breakdown relate care process . Electronic system improve follow-up reduce delay detect miss appointment incomplete procedure patient call back conduct timely investigation appropriate . To achieve high standard patient safety cancer diagnosis , investigator need use information technology appropriately also improve process , policy , procedure monitoring , communication , coordination care . Given importance cancer-related diagnostic delay ambulatory care , investigator need effective method detect , understand cause , intervene reduce . Manual technique detect delay , spontaneous report random chart review , limited effectiveness . Our propose study focus test method proactively identify delay use certain `` trigger '' occur intervene timely manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Electronic Health Record-Based Interventions Improving Follow-Up Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal proposal demonstrate test method large health care system efficiently identify cancer patient likely experience diagnostic delay pre-emptively rectify delay . This study build upon tool develop recent work ( Aim1 , prior IRB Protocol Number : H-23801 ) test effectiveness identify patient risk experience delay cancer diagnosis follow intervention investigator hypothesize reduce delay . This Aim 2 ( investigator seek approval ) final Aim proposal . Aim 1 approve Protocol Number : H-23801 . In Aim 2 investigator determine effectiveness IT-based intervention ( consist data mining use trigger test Aim 1 follow target electronic communication surveillance technique ) facilitate cancer diagnosis compare usual care ( use trigger electronic communication surveillance ) . Hypothesis 1 : The time first appearance diagnostic clue follow-up action ( e.g . colonoscopy performance positive FOBT ) significantly less intervention arm usual care . Hypothesis 2 : The percentage patient receive timely follow-up care significantly intervention arm usual care . To improve generalizability finding multiple ambulatory care environment , investigator conduct research two setting : urban Veterans Affairs facility Houston , Texas large primary care network central Texas . These setting include internal medicine family medicine , academic nonacademic practice , significant racial , gender , ethnic , age , urban/rural , socioeconomic diversity . Our study address coordination timeliness care , priority achieve high quality care . Hypothesis 3 : Overall , trigger achieve positive predictive value ( PPV ) least 50 % identifying delay care . PPV define number chart correctly identify delay diagnostic evaluation , divide total number chart identify trigger , deem approximately level necessary avoid substantial contribution provider alert fatigue .</detailed_description>
