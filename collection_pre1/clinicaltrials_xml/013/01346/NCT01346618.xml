	<brief_summary>Bone age assessment currently important tool final height implication child . It important tool phase investigation treatment short stature , tall stature , pubertal timing various endocrinological pediatric situation . It currently assess use hand x-ray . This method several limitation , include : requirement specialize medical staff interpret result , exposure radiation usage equipment radiology center . The investigator aim study new equipment , radiation free , simple swift operation provide immediate answer , need experience observer , mobile equipment easy accessibility . The aim study assess reproducibility , validity safety compare x-ray method . The investigator hypothesize accurate valid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Validity Bone Age Assessment Ultrasound Apparatus ( SonicBone )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skeletal maturity assessment , define also bone age ( BA ) , important role pediatrics pediatric endocrinology , use mainly evaluate growth puberty relate endocrine disorder . Repeated BA assessment important follow child short stature , precocious puberty treat growth promote medication . The commonly use method use determine skeletal maturity , thus BA base comparison hand wrist radiographs standard series representative film `` Radiographic atlas skeletal development hand wrist '' Greulich Pyle ( GP ) , issue several decade ago . Among disadvantage drawback BA assessment method : obligatory need use radiology unit often available special facility hospital , available physician office , exposure ionize radiation , know limitation method need endocrinologist ass BA , know large inter observer variability BA interpretation . The suggested method study base ultrasound technology , therefore quick , objective , radiation-free . It deliver immediate non bias result without need rely observer 's evaluation hand radiograph without need specialize radiology facility . This technique innovate order find efficient , convenient non radiation base method skeletal maturity assessment primary care physician perform office setting . The aim study establish correlation algorithm BA assessment ultrasound apparatus ( SonicBone ) X-ray base assessment use Grulich Pyle method , evaluate validity reproducibility apparatus , The design study perform concomitant skeletal maturation assessment read hand X-ray radiograph 3 experienced observer use GP method , ultrasound technique use SonicBone apparatus . Skeletal maturation assessment perform female male various age group .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Children age 417 year old Children perform perform hand xray part clinical work within 2 month study enrolment A sign Informed Consent Form obtain least one parent legal guardian audio approval ( phone call ) , available , prior ultrasound study . An assent child perform SonicBone 's BA device read Children take medication might change bone metabolism mineralization within last year ( glucocorticosteroids , sex steroid , oral contraceptive , anticonvulsant , calcium vitamin D superphysiological dos ) Children suspect bone disease multiple fracture .</criteria>
