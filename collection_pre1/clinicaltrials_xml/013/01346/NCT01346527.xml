	<brief_summary>Background : The health next generation likely program womb ( i.e.in utero ) , understand program happens allow u favorably influence health future generation . The focus proposal examine effect utero program heart function child born woman type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . Specifically , neonate bear diabetic woman abnormal heart structure weak heart function birth , may predispose long-term heart problem childhood , adolescence adulthood . At present , reason heart abnormalities child born woman diabetes unknown focus proposal . Objective ( ) Hypothesis ( e ) : The objective examine relationship among maternal lipid ( fatty acid , triglyceride , low density lipoprotein ) metabolism neonatal heart structure function diabetes identify clinical marker pregnancy heart dysfunction infant bear diabetic woman . The overall hypothesis maternal lipid metabolism abnormal diabetes , metabolic dysregulation increase fatty acid delivery fetus utero lead abnormal accumulation lipid fetal heart , result altered neonatal heart structure function infant bear diabetic woman . In addition , investigator hypothesize decreased maternal fatty acid oxidation ( fat `` burning '' ) rate , elevate lipolytic ( fat breakdown ) rate elevate blood total free fatty acid level predicts abnormal neonatal heart structure function infant born woman type 2 diabetes . Methods Procedures : The investigator test hypothesis use clinical metabolism study ( infusion stable isotope label fatty acid , serial blood breath sampling , mass spectrometry ) quantify whole-body fat ( fatty acid oxidation , lipolysis , serum fatty acid , triglyceride , VLDL-cholesterol level ) metabolism 25 diabetic woman 3rd trim pregnancy , compare lipid metabolism kinetics 25 body mass index match healthy non-diabetic woman pregnancy determine alteration maternal lipid metabolism predict abnormal neonatal heart function child born woman . Potential Impact : Type 2 diabetes epidemic United States steadily increase worldwide . Diabetes detrimental health effect pregnant woman offspring . The investigator know child born woman diabetes increase risk develop diabetes , obesity cardiovascular disease , child bear healthy woman . This proposal address important knowledge gap regard role maternal lipid ( potentially nutrient ) metabolism cardiovascular health global increase population child bear diabetic woman . Findings project novel innovative , likely point clinical intervention target correct lipid metabolic abnormality woman pre-gestational diabetes . The impact great long-term goal ameliorate heart problem child bear diabetic ( pre-gestational gestational ) woman . In addition , project establish small cohort child follow long-term address novel question progression heart metabolic abnormalities child bear diabetic woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : In United States , approximately 1.2 million child born woman diabetes mellitus ( DM ) year . This number increase due epidemic type 2 diabetes obesity Western society . Infants born diabetic woman ( IBDW ) alteration cardiac morphology function , may predispose long-term adverse cardiovascular health . At present , mechanisms adverse cardiovascular outcome IBDW unknown . Abnormal maternal glucose metabolism DM pregnancy previously think affect fetal cardiac development . However , recent finding indicate IBDW good 3rd trimester glucose control still develop cardiac abnormality . In fact , aspects maternal nutrient metabolism partitioning ( glycemic control ) may regulate fetal cardiac development . For example , abnormal fatty acid , triglyceride , lipoprotein metabolism common DM , maternal serum lipid level pregnant diabetic predict neonatal birth weight . The investigator propose maternal fatty acid metabolism dysregulated diabetic pregnancy . This increase fatty acid delivery fetus lead fetal myocardial lipid accumulation , alter neonatal heart morphology function IBDW . To date , explore human . The proposal stem `` lipotoxicity '' paradigm : chronic elevation maternal blood lipid ( i.e . fatty acid , triglyceride , low density lipoprotein ) level pregnancy lead increase lipid delivery cause myocardial lipid deposition develop fetus . These lipid displace glucose utilization fetal myocardium ; prefer fetal heart substrate healthy pregnancy . Abnormal fetal heart lipid deposition accumulation lipid metabolic intermediate ( e.g . ceramide ) may lead myocardial insulin resistance contractile dysfunction IBDW . The relationship abnormal nutrient metabolism pregnancy adverse cardiovascular metabolic health diabetes may important condition childhood obesity project could provide insight . Specific Aims : In 25 woman pre-gestational type 2 DM 25 healthy non-diabetic body mass index-matched control 3rd trimester pregnancy , investigator address follow Aims : Specific Aim 1 : To characterize maternal lipid metabolism kinetics ( fatty acid oxidation rate , lipolytic rate , fatty acid clearance rate ) maternal fetal serum lipid concentration ( free fatty acid , triglyceride low density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) ) . Hypothesis 1 : Women DM pregnancy high whole-body lipolytic rate serum lipid concentration , low whole-body fatty acid oxidation clearance rate healthy woman without DM pregnancy . Specific Aim 2A : To examine relationship among maternal lipid kinetics , maternal fetal plasma lipid concentration , neonatal cardiac morphology function neonates born woman . Specific Aim 2B : To determine whether maternal lipid metabolism kinetics , maternal serum lipid level clinical marker maternal glycemic control alone combination predict abnormal neonatal cardiac function . Hypothesis 2A : . Altered maternal lipid metabolism kinetics ( higher lipolytic low fatty acid oxidation rate ) relate elevated maternal fetal serum lipid concentration abnormal neonatal cardiac function . Hypothesis 2B . The combination maternal lipid metabolism kinetics ( lipolytic fatty acid oxidation rate ) serum fatty acid level superior marker glycemic control ( HBA1C fructosamine ) predict neonatal cardiac function . Design : Whole-body lipid metabolism kinetics ( fatty acid oxidation , lipolytic , clearance rate ) measure clinical metabolism study use stable isotope tracer methodology mass spectrometry perform Clinical Research Unit Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Facility Washington University School Medicine . Umbilical cord blood collect parturition serum lipid ( fatty acid , triglyceride VLDL ) nutrient well growth-related hormone level quantify . Neonatal heart function ( within 2 week parturition ) examine use 2D , Doppler , tissue Doppler strain/strain rate echocardiography perform St. Louis Children 's Hospital . Potential Impact : Currently , nothing know regard role lipid metabolism cardiac abnormality IBDW . This translational proposal address important knowledge gap regard potential role abnormal lipid metabolism development cardiac abnormality IBDW . These association critical step towards understand mechanism cardiac morphologic functional alteration IBDW , order identify clinical prognostic marker cardiac abnormality IBDW , develop targeted intervention cardiac deficit , decrease future risk cardiovascular disease heart failure IBDW . The potential impact finding could extend woman child pre-gestational diabetes , child bear woman clinical complication include gestational diabetes , obesity , intrauterine growth retardation , HIV .</detailed_description>
