However , patient may respond treatment way currently administer raise interest find alternative , possibly optimal way administer tDCS . This study investigate whether tDCS stimulation use alternative electrode montage antidepressant effect . Further session tDCS , space less frequently , trialed maintenance treatment . Mood , cognitive test performance biomarkers measure periodically duration trial .</brief_summary>
