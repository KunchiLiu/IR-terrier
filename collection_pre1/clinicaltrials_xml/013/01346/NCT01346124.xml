	<brief_summary>There two type external radiation treatment ; proton beam photon beam radiation . What type therapy participant receive depend upon location tumor . Standard treatment would involve receive either proton photon radiation deliver three dimensional ( 3-D ) conformal radiation technique . 3-D conformal radiation therapy technique beam radiation use treatment shape match tumor order avoid damage healthy surround tissue . Standard treatment also may include photon radiation deliver intensity modulate ( IMRT ) technique . In research study use investigational technique deliver proton radiation therapy call intensity modulate proton radiation treatment ( IMPT ) use target cancer spar healthy tissue . With IMPT ( standard IMRT ) , radiation intensity turn treatment . This control intensity radiation dose potential provide accuracy allow u safely increase amount radiation deliver tumor . This accuracy may potentially reduce side effect patient would normally experience 3-D proton radiation therapy . Surgery often important component treatment tumor may integrate IMPT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Dose Intensity Modulated Proton Radiation Treatment +/- Surgical Resection Sarcomas Spine , Sacrum Base Skull</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Before begin radiation therapy , participant radiation plan compute tomographic ( CT ) scan tumor site . This consider standard care doctor use image scan plan radiation treatment . - Participants may also receive surgery either study radiation treatment . This surgery also consider standard care would do regardless research study . - The IMPT technique deliver radiation research purpose . Radiation treatment affect tumor give daily , Monday Friday . - The following procedure perform week treatment : assessment nerve , neuromuscular , motor sensory function clinical exam toxicity assessment . - Participants return follow-up visit completion radiation treatment follow interval : 6 week completion treatment , 6 month treatment , every 6 month thereafter 4 year , year 15 year .</detailed_description>
