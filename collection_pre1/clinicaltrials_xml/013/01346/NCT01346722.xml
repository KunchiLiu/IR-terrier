	<brief_summary>It well document zinc supplementation low-income population result reduce incidence childhood diarrhoea pneumonia , improve growth stunt child . Implementation large scale programme need prevention zinc deficiency area common . In Bangladesh , risk zinc deficiency consider high child could benefit greatly improve zinc intake daily basis . Zinc supplementation national scale would formidable task even implement might sustainable long range . There thus need find alternative . It might sustainable improve intake zinc fortify staple , e.g . rice increase amount zinc ; fact biofortified rice develop conventional breeding , design contain amount zinc could meet least 40 % daily requirement . To assess potential biofortified rice provide good , bioavailable source additional zinc , investigator propose measure zinc absorption rice-based meal among Bangladeshi preschool child . Specifically , investigator measure amount zinc absorb zinc-biofortified rice ( Diet-ZBfR , 24 mg Zn/kg ) , compare absorbed conventional Bangladeshi rice ( Diet-CR , 16 mg Zn/kg ) ( control ) . The investigator also compare zinc absorption biofortified rice zinc-fortified conventional rice ( Diet-CR+Z ) . The study cross-over , randomize , control clinical study . In total , 42 child age 36-59 month either sex recruit peri-urban community Dhaka , individually randomize , equal number , one two comparison group , A B . The group A child receive zinc biofortified rice-based diet ( Diet-ZBfR ) conventional rice-based diet ( Diet-CR ) use randomize , cross-over design . Similarly , group B child receive zinc biofortified rice-based diet ( Diet-ZBfR ) zinc fortify rice base diet ( Diet-CR+Z ) , also use randomize , cross-over design . The investigator use zinc stable isotope tracer technique measure fractional absorption zinc , tracer : tracee ratio measure spot urine sample follow administration intravenously administer tracer ( 68Zn ) one two oral tracer ( 70Zn , 67Zn ) provide test meal two-day period . If zinc biofortified rice find adequately bioavailable , tested randomize , control , efficacy trial among rural Bangladeshi child .</brief_summary>
