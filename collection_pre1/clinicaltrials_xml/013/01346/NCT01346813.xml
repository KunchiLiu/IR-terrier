	<brief_summary>Sick premature neonate expose frequent painful stressful procedure stay neonatal intensive care unit . Although neonate feel pain may long term effect induce painful experience , prevention treatment neonatal pain far optimal many unit . An epidemiological study ( EPIPPAIN ) conduct neonatal pediatric intensive care unit France 2005 show painful procedure extremely frequent analgesic treatment vary lot among unit . Since many guideline issue international scientific society manage neonatal pain , one may expect prevention treatment neonatal pain improve last 6 year . Although awake endotracheal intubation extremely difficult impossible old child adult , intubation still frequently perform without sedation/analgesia neonate . Recent study show premedications facilitate intubation condition greatly improve neonate tolerance procedure . Studies aim assess risk benefit different sedations/analgesia strategy urgently need neonate . We also need tool assess time technical condition intubation tolerance neonate procedure data different study compare . The objective present study : 1 . To describe incidence painful stressful procedure perform neonate intensive care unit well neonates transport medical emergency system ( SMUR ) Ile-de-France region 6 year first EPPIPAIN study conduct region type population order assess evolution practice . The description painful stressful procedure complete real-time around-the-clock assessment pain induce procedure use validated behavioral pain scale . 2 . To link study The Epipage study 2 order look association number painful stressful procedure and/or analgesic treatment neonatal period neurological outcome child follow Epipage cohort . The Epipage study separate study follow 13 year cohort premature neonate recruit 2011 . 3 . To describe incidence painful stressful procedure analgesic treatment neonate transport pediatric emergency system ( SMUR ) Ile-de-France region France . 4 . To obtain initial validity tool permit assess intubation neonate . An observational detailed description endotracheal intubation condition conduct neonate transport intubated SMUR neonate intubate intensive care unit 5 . To describe continuous sedation analgesia practice ventilate neonate intensive care unit . For neonate , data medical record recover 2 month admission intensive care unit 6 . To describe frequency heel stick glycemia measurement blood gaze practice among center . Relate heel stick practice normality abnormality glycemia result</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY HYPOTHESIS Principal hypothesis - The number painful stressful procedure perform neonate admit intensive care unit still high low 2005 Pain score low procedure perform specific analgesia prior procedure . Secondary hypothesis - The frequency pre-procedural analgesia high 2005 - Certain common procedure heel stick endotracheal intubation carry frequent analgesia 2005 - The use continuous sedation analgesia induce reduction specific pre-procedural analgesia - A real-time pain assessment painful procedure carry 80 % procedure perform neonate intensive care unit Pain score show certain procedure apparently painful may elicit high pain score sick neonate - Certain procedure nurse care weigh may induce high pain score neonates invasive tube ( endotracheal tube , thoracic drainage ) - A continuous sedation analgesia give 50 % ventilate neonate . - Certain characteristic neonate may influence use analgesic painful procedure . Ex : gender , age , respiratory support - Certain contextual characteristic center may influence use analgesic painful procedure . Ex : day night , pain referent unit , night head nurse , write pain management guideline . - More 80 % semi-urgent non-urgent intubation carry use premedication . - Opioids commonly drug use premedication endotracheal intubation neonates - The assessment intubating condition neonate tolerance show lower score intubation perform premedication consider `` recommended '' American Academy Pediatrics - The detailed observation intubation SMUR intensive care unit enable initial validation tool assessment - Too many capillary blood sample heel stick carry neonate even neonates normal value throughout repeat stick . - The frequency blood gas assessment widely variable among center - The frequency capillary blood glycemia widely variable among center LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF PAIN AND ANALGESIC TREATMENTS This objective assess match data current Epippain study another parallel study ( Epipage 2 ) Principal hypothesis - After adjust disease severity , neonates undergo painful procedure poorer neurological outcome later infancy . Secondary hypothesis - Higher pain score associate poorer neurological outcome later infancy - The use central analgesic like opioid negative effect neurological outcome later infancy . - The potential negative effect numerous painful procedure neonatal period counteract use analgesic . METHODOLOGY This study carry neonate care two setting : ( ) neonatal pediatric intensive care unit ( ii ) medical regional pediatric transport system ( SMUR ) In intensive care unit , study design prospective observational study collect around-the-clock bedside data painful stressful procedure perform neonate admit participate unit . All 16 tertiary care center , Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICUs ) Pediatric Intensive Care Units ( PICUs ) Paris Region participate . Since observational study change standard care carry . During first 14 day admission participate unit , prospective data collect neonatal procedure cause pain , stress , discomfort correspond analgesic therapy . A real-time assessment pain induced procedure carry unit staff use DAN scale . A detailed record condition endotracheal intubation also carry . Demographic data , type duration respiratory support , sedative analgesic drug administer concomitantly pre-procedure , condition related procedure ( type , hour day , operator , parental presence ) collect . We 'll also record repeat procedure attempt procedure require one attempt successful completion . The use specific pre-procedural analgesia note procedure . If neonate discharge unit 14 day , data collection painful procedure stop day discharge . In medical regional pediatric transport system ( SMUR ) , neonates transport 2-months study period , procedure record specific data collection form . Demographic data , type respiratory support , sedative analgesic drug administer concomitantly pre-procedure , condition related procedure ( type , hour day , operator , parental presence ) collect . We 'll also record repeat procedure attempt procedure require one attempt successful completion . The use specific pre-procedural analgesia note procedure . A real-time assessment pain induced procedure carry unit staff use DAN scale . A detailed record condition neonate tolerance endotracheal intubation also carry .</detailed_description>
