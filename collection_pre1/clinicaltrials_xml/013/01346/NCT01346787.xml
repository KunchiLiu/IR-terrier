	<brief_title>Carfilzomib , Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone In Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol phase II multicenter , international , non-comparative , open label study design jointly assess safety efficacy association Carfilzomib Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone ( CCd ) induction treatment Carfilzomib alone maintenance newly diagnose MM patient . Patients evaluate scheduled visit 4 study period : pre-treatment , treatment , maintenance long-term follow-up . The pre-treatment period include screen visit , perform study entry . After provide write informed consent participate study , patient evaluate study eligibility . The screening period include availability inclusion criterion describe . The treatment period include administration Carfilzomib , Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone 9 4-week course . In order ass toxicity treatment , patient attend study centre visit schedule Carfilzomib administration . The response assess 4-week cycle . The maintenance period include carfilzomib alone day 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 36mg/m2 . For patient show evidence progression maintenance phase , frequency Carfilzomib increase day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 discretion investigator . It initiate end 9th course stop progression intolerance . The median expect duration maintenance treatment approximately 2 year . The Long Term Follow Up period start development confirm Progression Disease , patient follow survival Long Term Follow Up period every 3 month via telephone office visit . Approximately 15 Italian center foreign center participate protocol . Patients symptomatic newly diagnose MM whose age ≥ 65 year ineligible autologous stem cell transplantation . Up 53 patient enrol different center . The duration treatment approximately 9 month . This length time require complete 9 course CCd . At end first stage ( 19 patient ) , trial temporarily stop 19 patient complete toxicity efficacy evaluation ( 3 cycle ) : 7 response less 8 toxicity , group 34 patient ( total=53 ) enrol . Otherwise , trial definitively stop DSMC recommend test dos drug . The maintenance period phase start end 9th course stop progression intolerance . The median expect duration maintenance treatment approximately 2 year . The duration follow-up relapse approximately 2 year . The occurrence PD determine duration TTP patient . The occurrence death determine duration overall survival . The first analysis evaluate safety efficacy plan 19 patient enrol first stage study complete third cycle induction treatment . The trial stop &lt; 6 response , &gt; 9 toxicity Data Safety Monitoring Committee recommend test dos drug ; Otherwise , group 34 patient ( total=53 ) enrol . The final conclusion negative ≤ 23/53 response , ≥ 20/53 drug-related toxicity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient legally consent age define local regulation . Patient age ≥ 65 year age ineligible autologous stem cell transplantation . Patient , investigator ( ) opinion , willing able comply protocol requirement . Patient give voluntary write informed consent performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw patient time without prejudice future medical care . Female patient either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study . Male patient agree use acceptable method contraception ( i.e. , condom abstinence ) duration study . Patient newly diagnose MM patient . Patient measurable disease , define follow : quantifiable serum monoclonal protein value ( generally , necessarily , ≥ 0.5 g/dL Mprotein ) , applicable , urine lightchain excretion &gt; 200 mg/24 hour . For patient oligo nonsecretory MM , require measurable plasmacytoma &gt; 2 cm determine clinical examination applicable radiograph ( i.e . MRI , CTScan ) abnormal free light chain ratio ( n.v. : 0.261.65 ) . We anticipate less 10 % patient admit study oligo nonsecretory MM free light chain order maximize interpretation benefit result . Patient Karnofsky performance status ≥60 % . Patient lifeexpectancy &gt; 3 month . Patient follow laboratory value within 14 day Baseline ( day 1 Cycle 1 , study drug administration ) : Platelet count ≥50 x 109/L ( ≥30 x 109 /L myeloma involvement bone marrow &gt; 50 % ) within 14 day prior drug administration ) . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1 x 109/L without use growth factor . Corrected serum calcium ≤14 mg/dL ( 3.5 mmol/L ) Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) : ≤ 3 x ULN . Total bilirubin : ≤ 2 x ULN . Calculated measured creatinine clearance : ≥ 15 mL/minute Patients nonsecretory MM , unless serum free light chain present ratio abnormal . Pregnant lactate female Patient active infectious hepatitis type B C HIV . Patients myocardial infarction unstable angina ≤ 4 month clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , CHF NY Heart Association class III IV , uncontrolled hypertension , history labile hypertension , history poor compliance antihypertensive regimen ) Peripheral neuropathy &gt; CTCAE grade 2 ≥ grade 2 painful peripheral neuropathy ( difference exclusion patient Grade 2 painful PN ) . Known history allergy Capsidol ( cyclodextrin derivative use solubilize carfilzomib ) Contraindication require concomitant drug supportive treatment , include hypersensitivity anticoagulation antiplatelet option , antiviral drug , intolerance hydration due preexist pulmonary cardiac impairment . Subjects pleural effusion require thoracentesis ascites require paracentesis within 14 day prior baseline ; Patient clinically significant illness would , investigator 's opinion , increase patient 's risk toxicity . Patients prior malignancy within last 5 year ( except basal squamous cell carcinoma , situ cancer cervix breast , localized prostate cancer Gleason score &lt; 7 stable PSA )</criteria>
