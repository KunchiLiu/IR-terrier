	<brief_title>A Trial Behavioral Economic Interventions Reduce Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death United States . Despite strong evidence reduce low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) statins successfully lower CVD risk , physicians under-prescribe statin , physician fail intensify treatment indicated , 50 % patient stop take statin within one year first prescription , though therapy typically life-long . In study , test effectiveness different behavioral economic intervention increase statin use reduce LDL cholesterol among patient poor cholesterol control high risk CVD . The application conceptual approach behavioral economics offer considerable promise advance health health care . Pay performance initiative represent one potential application , one incorporate underlie psychology decision maker generally do , experimental test conduct . We test approach among primary care physicians patient high risk CVD Geisinger Health System University Pennsylvania outpatient clinic . Using 4-arm , cluster-randomized control trial , aim answer question : [ 1 ] How provision provider incentive compare provision patient incentive , combination patient provider incentive , incentive ? [ 2 ] Are result sustained incentive intervention withdrawn ? [ 3 ] How approach compare implementation , acceptability , cost , cost-effectiveness ?</detailed_description>
