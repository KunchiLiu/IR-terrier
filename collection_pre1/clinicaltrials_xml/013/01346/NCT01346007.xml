	<brief_title>Study 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine Children With Idiopathic Nephrotic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome ( INS ) frequent glomerular disease child 16 year old incidence rate 2-7/100,000 patients/year depend ethnicity . Those patient susceptible invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) include peritonitis , pneumonia without pleural effusion meningitis . Due increase mortality risk relapse associate IPD , recommend child INS immunize pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [ 1 ] . However , concern vaccine safety impaired immunogenicity due INS pathogenesis immunosuppressive treatment hurdle universal implementation exist guideline . To thoroughly evaluate safety 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV7 ) child INS remission , investigate possible association vaccination increase risk recurrence INS . We also study immunogenicity kinetics immune response INS patient healthy subject effect different type treatment primary immune response antibody persistence 12-14 month follow vaccination PCV7 .</detailed_description>
