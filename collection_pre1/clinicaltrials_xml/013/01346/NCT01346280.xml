	<detailed_description>There little evidence regard effect multidisciplinary care ( MDC ) health outcome across various cancer site , include colon , rectal , lung cancer . The current study address gap provide preliminary data regard relationship MDC select process outcome care NCCCP pilot site . The long-term goal preliminary study generate effect size , establish feasibility , build infrastructure support development large definitive study MDC outcomes . The key aim pilot study determine relationship specific MDC assessment area identify pre-existing MDC assessment tool ( http : //ncccp .cancer.gov /NCCCPMDC- Matrix- Tool . pdf ) : case planning , physician engagement , coordination care , infrastructure , financial , clinical trial medical record , follow outcome [ 0 ] process [ P ] : 1 ) time receipt initial therapy [ P ] ; 2 ) receipt multi-modality therapy [ O ] ; 3 ) evaluation enrollment clinical trial [ P ] ; 4 ) patient experience [ O ] ; 5 ) adherence NCCN treatment guideline [ P ] ; 6 ) all-cause survival [ O ] . The study focus adult patient incident diagnosis Stage III colon cancer , Stage II III rectal cancer , Stage III non-small cell lung cancer . We quantify relationship MDC , various care process outcomes across 16 participate NCCCP site , test hypothesis increase level MDC identify MDC tool associate improvement care quality survival advantage . Significant progress achieve past year establish necessary process conduct research study deliverable associate study . In term process outcomes , report follow : 1 . Institutional Review Board approval multidisciplinary care study 16 site ; 2 . The development Standard Operating Procedures manual use 16 site ; 3 . The development data collection form ( Site Data Collection Tool ) use collect information available via pre-existing web-based data collection system place 16 site ; 4 . The development data collection form use document facility annual score use Multidisciplinary Care Assessment tool . 5 . The development flowchart use operationalizing measurement NCCN guideline adherence patient Stage III non small cell lung cancer ; 6 . The development Frequently Asked Questions document assist address question real time ; 7 . Multiple training sessions/webinars hold participate site . 8 . Monthly conference call research team representative participate site .</detailed_description>
