	<brief_summary>HIV patient particular risk develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) exhibit multiple know risk factor CVD . Of specific concern fact use non nucleosidic reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) and/or protease inhibitor ( PI ) drug class associate dyslipidemia know increase risk coronary heart disease particularly among old subject normalize CD4 cell count suppress HIV replication . HIV patient could thus potentially receive anti-aggregant therapy concomitantly antiretroviral treatment . Prasugrel anti-aggregating agent indicate prevent recurrence ischemic event coronary artery stenting . It pro-drug mainly metabolize cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A 2B6 less extent CYP2C9 2C19 . Ritonavir anti-protease CYP3A4 CYP2B6 inhibitor use anti-HIV therapy . The aim present study assess potential drug-drug interaction prasugrel CYP3A/2B6 inhibitor ritonavir . Ten healthy volunteer receive prasugrel 10mg alone 100mg ritonavir . The effect ritonavir prasugrel pharmacokinetics assess . The two session separate one-week `` wash '' period . During session , CYP3A , 2B6 , 2C9 2C19 activity assess micrococktail approach microdoses midazolam , bupropion , flurbiprofen omeprazole . The pharmacokinetics prasugrel active metabolite assess two session .</brief_summary>
