	<detailed_description>The recently develop technique Cardiac CT Perfusion ( CTP ) gather information coronary anatomy myocardial perfusion single scan . This diagnostic test detect presence coronary plaque well assess functional significance stenosis . To date , estimate 1000 case CTP perform world . While exceptional adverse event report ( expect ) , image quality clinical validation multi-center multi-vendor setting mark issue many expert nascent field . This issue hamper clinical utility test raise concern widespread utilization lead unnecessary cost exposure radiation . Historically , rapid explosion use related procedure , Cardiac CT Angiography ( CCTA ) start 2004 mark large-scale variation radiation dose , quality issue , inappropriate use , interpretation proficiency . Critics rapid growth CCTA defame procedure imaging abuse charge note unchecked irresponsible use radiation . The purpose RECRUIT prevent clinical inefficiency occur . The main goal RECRUIT determine best practice optimal acquisition interpretation CTP image , effort optimize standard inevitable rapid adoption potentially revolutionary technology . RECRUIT aim maximize clinical effectiveness minimize clinical risk associate CTP protocol becomes integrated standard-of-care harmonization best practice nearly impossible . RECRUIT enable select clinic currently perform CCTA perform CTP training late acquisition technique provide field leader CTP . In addition provide acquisition protocol , researcher provide clinical team sophisticate EDC tool effectively monitor numerous factor could influence quality image . Finally , RECRUIT collect de-identified image sit analysis core lab . Analysis image correlate acquisition technique patient factor ( i.e . BMI ) . This information feed back clinical team perform procedure effort improve proficiency . This process proceed iterative manner , endpoint track report peer-reviewed literature .</detailed_description>
