	<brief_summary>Background . Human herpes virus establish lifelong latency primary infection may reactivate immunosuppressed patient cause significant morbidity mortality . In immunocompetent patient , although reactivation may occur disease development deter competent host immune response . Recent study indicate approximately one third CMV seropositive immunocompetent ICU patient present CMV reactivation associate poor outcome , potentially secondary stress incur . CMV reactivation among immunocompetent critically ill child assess . Study Hypothesis : Identifiable risk factor associate CMV reactivation exist may use future assessment antiviral prophylaxis administration . Aim : Primary aim identify risk factor associate CMV reactivation poor outcome immunocompetent child adult severe stress . Whether CMV reactivation occur critically ill child clinical implication remain determined . Secondary aim study role cellular signal pathway inflammation specific adaptive immunity process . Work package : A multicenter observational prospective study conduct among CMV seropositive pediatric adult ICU patient . Patient clinical progress , laboratory finding , management , complication record 28 day follow ICU admission . Salivary free cortisol level , plasma catecholamine , serum cytokine level measure assess stress . CMV reactivation evaluate weekly detect CMV-DNA peripheral blood bronchial wash sample real-time PCR . In patient subsample , nuclear factor κB intracellular GC receptor measure peripheral blood monocyte study cellular signal pathways inflammation . The adaptive immune response CMV infection follow vitro viral polypeptide stimulation prospectively examine subset patient . Expected Results : The study provide original data critically ill child . Further knowledge regard risk factor associate CMV reactivation poor outcome accumulate . Novel information regard role cellular inflammation specific adaptive immune response CMV reactivation gather .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multicenter prospective observational study CMV seropositive patient ( child adult ) admit ICU . Two pediatric four adult ICU unit tertiary teaching hospital recruit 48 36 month respectively . Research plan Upon ICU admission , patient ( group A B ) screen inclusion/exclusion criterion write informed consent obtain patient enrol . Clinical severity estimate use standardized score system ( PRISM III APACHI II respectively ) . All pertinent demographic , medical history , clinical presentation medical intervention enter database . Prior initiate supportive treatment ( inotropes corticosteroid ) blood saliva obtain determination biological marker stress . Serum whole blood collect determination CMV-IgG antibodies CMV-DNA respectively . CMV seronegative patient excluded evaluation . Seropositive patient follow prospectively 28 day . Weekly follow ( 7th , 14th , 21st 28th day hospitalization ) include : clinical laboratory evaluation , documentation therapeutic intervention CMV reactivation assessment ( CMV-DNA detection ) . Stress marker re-examined day 7 . On day 28 ( end follow ) clinical outcome record . In random subset patient ( 20 child 20 adult ) intracellular signal pathway inflammation specific immune response study . Laboratory Methods A ) Serology CMV : Serum CMV-IgG antibody measure Enzyme Immunoassay Method ( Elisa , Abbott Laboratories ) hospital serology lab . B ) Estimation biological stress indicator B.1 . Measurement free cortisol . Saliva sample collect three time day ( 8.00 , 2.00pm 8.00 pm ) determine circadian pattern cortisol secretion use special synthetic swab ( Salivetta-Salivette , Sarsted ® ) store -70oC . Cortisol level determine electrochemiluminescence immunoassay ( Elecsys Cortisol reagent kit , ROCHE ) . B.2 . Plasma catecholamine . Catecholamine level ( noradrenaline , adrenaline dopamine ) measure initiation therapy inotropic agent . Samples take venous catheter patient supine patient receive inotropes . Plasma store -85oC . The Liquid HPLC reverse phase ( High Performance Liquid Chromatography - reverse phase ) use . B.3 . Serum TNF-a measure quantitative-sandwich-Enzyme Immunoassay method ( Elecsys , ROCHE ) . C ) Detection quantification CMV-DNA whole blood bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL , ventilate patient ) . If patient discharge day 28 , salivettes give home collect saliva CMV-DNA determination ( store home fridge ) return day 28 . Samples store -70oC sample patient examine time . DNA extraction real-time PCR perform commercial kit ( Nanogen Advanced Diagnostics ) . A gene region encode Major Immediate Early Antigen ( MIEA ) CMV detect . All PCR test perform Cytology Laboratory , Attikon University Hospital , Athens Greece ( Associate Prof P. Karakitsos ) . D ) Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) nuclear factor κB ( NFκB ) measurement whole cell nuclear extract peripheral blood lymphocyte perform immunoblotting Department Biological Chemistry , Athens University ( Ass . Prof P. Moutsatsou ) 8 E ) Specific immune response CMV . Specific immune response CD4+ CD8+ T lymphocytes peripheral blood in-vitro stimulation CMV polypeptide ( include pp65 antigen ) study intracellular staining ( Intracellular staining , ICS ) . The proliferation CD4+ ( CFSE ) cytotoxicity CD8+ ( perforin granzyme B ) assess . Statistical analysis For data analysis adult child examine separately . Seropositive patient without CMV reactivation use control group . A p-value ( p ) ≤0.05 criterion statistical significance . T-test chi-square test use quantitative qualitative analysis , Mantel-Haenzel method use calculate relative risk different outcome ( mortality , intubation , etc ) two group . To identify potential risk factor associate CMV reactivation clinical outcome , logistic regression analysis use statistical program SAS v.9 perform . Sample calculation To calculate study sample size statistical program EpiInfo version 6 use . Based recent data adult , 30 % may demonstrate CMV reactivation ICU . The mortality rate pediatric adult ICU estimate reach approximately 8 % 63 % respectively . Recent data suggest CMV reactivation associate increased mortality ( RR=1,93 ) morbidity ( RR=5,70 ) . The sample size calculate meet criterion 99 % confidence interval 90 % statistical power . We estimate CMV ( + ) population include 165 child 109 adult . Work package WP1 WP2 involve clinical research ; enrollment clinical follow child adult respectively . All data collection enter anonymous database include demographic data , past history , clinical laboratory evaluation , clinical management intervention upon admission follow period . Adults child evaluate separately . Once CMV result provide ( WP4 ) , risk factor associate CMV reactivation well adverse clinical outcome , include directly ( i.e . pneumonitis , febrile episode , hepatitis ) indirectly associate ( i.e . extend ICU stay mechanical ventilation , increased rate bacterial infection ) examine . WP3 involve evaluation stress clinical ( WP3.1 WP 3.2 ) basic research ( WP3.3 ) approach . Biochemical stress marker evaluate upon admission day 7 examine duration stress . Concomitant drug administration take account . Stress marker correlate CMV reactivation clinical outcome examine whether use identifiable risk factor future research . In WP3.3 cellular signal pathways inflammation subset cohort study . Specifically interaction NFκΒ activation glucocorticoid receptor sensitivity patient ' mononuclear cell evaluate correlated CMV reactivation outcome . WP4 involve prospective detection quantification CMV-DNA different biological sample . All data include main database importantly DNA bank form possible detection herpesviruses future . WP5 evaluate specific immune response CMV subset patient . These correlate underlying disease , reactivation stress . Moreover , bank supernatant experiment form measure cytokine ( Luminex ) future .</detailed_description>
