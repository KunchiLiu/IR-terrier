	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy one commonly perform operation general surgery consider standard care cholecystectomy benign biliary disease . The laparoscopic approach cholecystectomy , compare open surgery , associate less postoperative pain , quick recovery time improve cosmetic result . Most commonly , laparoscopic cholecystectomy perform use 10-12mm port umbilicus 3 additional port consist either three 5mm port , combination two 5mm port one 10mm port . A new technique call minilaparoscopic ( also refer needlescopic ) surgery recently emerge . Minilaparoscopic surgery replace 5mm trocars small 3mm trocars . Surgery use small trocars hypothesize reduce postoperative pain recovery time well improve cosmetic result follow laparoscopic surgery . Our goal compare outcomes randomized trial compare conventional minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minilaparoscopic Versus Conventional Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Since introduction late 1980 's , laparoscopic cholecystectomy quickly become standard care surgery benign disease gallbladder . When compare open surgery , laparoscopic surgery associate decrease post-operative pain . Recovery time return usual activity also significantly short follow laparoscopic procedure . Cholecystectomy era laparoscopic surgery become out-patient procedure . Furthermore , laparoscopic surgery eliminate large surgical scar provide patient improve cosmetic result . Laparoscopic technology evolve rapidly last 20 year . The quality instrument , especially optic , greatly improve since first laparoscopic cholecystectomy perform . A significant trend development new technology move toward small instrument camera . Where 10mm camera standard early year laparoscopy , 5mm camera offer excellent optical quality permit use few 10mm trocars . In movement toward increasingly less invasive technique , minilaparoscopic surgery emerge . Minilaparoscopic surgery ( also call needlescopic surgery ) involve use small trocars instrument , typically 3mm size . It hypothesize small trocars cause less tissue damage therefore result improve post-operative pain recovery , offer additional benefit improved cosmesis . Previous study find minilaparoscopic surgery safe , complication rate great conventional laparoscopic technique . In study , minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy associate slightly increase operative time . Previous study also note high conversion rate ( change plan operative technique another technique ) , however conversion typically minilaparoscopy conventional laparoscopy ; rate conversion minilaparoscopy open procedure higher conventional laparoscopy . However recent meta-analysis perform Thakur et al . ( 1 ) find study show trend toward long operative time increased conversion rate , overall evidence weak . While number previous study attempt evaluate benefit patient derive minilaparoscopic surgery , include post-operative pain recovery time , many study flaw methodological concern . Thakur et al show meta-analysis minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy associate improved cosmesis one month well reduce post-operative pain faster recovery time . These benefit however estimate minimal base available evidence . Unclear report trial flaw study design , specifically lack `` intention treat '' analysis , make interpretation available data difficult meta-analysis conclude `` evidence use minicholecystecomy unclear . '' More high quality evidence need surgical community determine utility benefit minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy . It hope rigorous methodological design add available literature determine minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy valuable technique benefit patient . Hypothesis Minilaparoscopic surgery reduce postoperative pain recovery time , well improve cosmetic result patient undergoing cholecystectomy . Objectives A randomized trial compare minilaparoscopic cholecystectomy standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy perform : 1 . Determine minilaparoscopic surgery associate decrease postoperative pain 2 . Determine minilaparoscopic surgery result associate quick recovery return usual activity 3 . Determine minilaparoscopic surgery associate improve cosmetic result</detailed_description>
