	<brief_summary>Many pregnant woman experience stress , fatigue , poor sleep quality may influence infant outcome prematurity low birthweight immunologic pathway biomarkers ( serum cytokine c-reactive protein ) . In contrast , TaiChi exercise , one kind physical activity , increase pulmonary immune function reduce stress may therefore prevent pregnancy complication prevent adverse pregnancy outcome ; however , effect explore study . Therefore , study aim investigate relationship prenatal stress , fatigue , sleep quality , biomarkers , infant outcome ; modify TaiChi exercise program suitable pregnant woman ; test effect exercise reduce stress fatigue , promote sleep quality , modulate biomarkers , prevent adverse infant outcome . Infant outcomes study measure gestational age birthweight . The study three-stage longitudinal interventional design .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Modified TaiChi Exercise Maternal Stress , Fatigue , Sleep Quality , Biomarkers , Infant Gestational Age Birthweight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first-stage , pattern prenatal stress , fatigue , sleep quality investigate survey 300 pregnant woman 23 week gestation screen pregnant woman fatigue poor sleep quality . In second-stage , expert obstetrics TaiChi invite modify TaiChi exercise program . Thirty woman experience fatigue poor sleep quality invite practice modify TaiChi exercise . Comments participant program use refine program DVD make . After program well-designed record , participant recruit third-stage study randomly assign TaiChi comparison group . They ask complete questionnaire give blood sample biomarker test 27-29 , 31-33 , 35-37 week gestation ; labor ; 4-6 week postpartum . In addition practice exercise home , participant TaiChi group practice TaiChi group every month . In contrast , comparison group ask keep usual daily activity , intervention introduce . Phone call postcard make sent routinely participants ensure long-term participation . Questionnaires use study include 10-item Perceived Stress Scale , Multidimensional Assessment Fatigue Scale , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index . Descriptive statistic , Pearson correlation , generalize estimate equation apply understand predictive effect maternal stress , fatigue , sleep quality , biomarkers infant outcome ; effect modify TaiChi exercise maternal stress , fatigue , sleep quality , biomarkers , infant outcome . In addition develop modify TaiChi exercise program suitable pregnant woman , study anticipates maternal stress , fatigue , poor sleep quality predict infant outcome immunologic pathway , modify TaiChi exercise reduce maternal stress fatigue , improve sleep quality , modulate biomarkers , hence prevent adverse infant outcome .</detailed_description>
