	<detailed_description>Background From mechanical point view goal cardiovascular system distribute kinetic energy blood ejection leave ventricle ( LV ) body organs minimal loss great efficiency . The left ventricle arterial circulation work `` couple '' system . The ideal coupling supposes maximum energy produce LV convert forward flow perfuse body organs . This match `` source '' ( LV ) `` load '' ( arterial circulation ) govern mechanical property part cardiovascular system . Variety pathological condition change couple way may adversely affect organ blood flow presence unchanged even high cardiac output , significantly increase metabolic demand LV maintenance adequate systemic perfusion due decrease mechanical efficiency work produce LV . Although effect anesthetic agent myocardial contractility peripheral vascular tone extensively study clinical condition , little known influence ventriculo-arterial coupling . Propofol inhalational agent appear impair equilibrium animal experiment . This surprising , since agent cause complex dose-dependent change many physiologic parameter , include myocardial contractility , leave ventricular preload afterload , diastolic property myocardium baroreceptor control hemodynamics . Although property anesthetic agent delineate extensively , limited data characterize influence ventriculo-arterial couple clinical condition exist . This information especially meaningful plan anesthetic management patient undergo cardiac surgery , maintenance circulatory homeostasis outmost importance . Since main hemodynamic goal anesthesia patient cardiovascular disease provide optimal tissue perfusion minimal myocardial oxygen demand , i.e . maximal mechanical efficiency , knowledge anesthetic induced change ventriculo-arterial couple extremely relevant clinical point view . The convenient method evaluation ventriculo-arterial coupling analysis relationship LV end-systolic elastance , load-independent measure myocardial contractility , effective arterial end-systolic elastance , measure mechanical loading conditions8 . Physiological data necessary calculation parameter may acquire relatively non-invasive way combine analyze together record arterial blood pressure waveform data change LV volume , may obtain mean echocardiography . Objectives General The aim study delineate compare change ventriculo-arterial coupling cause two popular anesthetic protocol commonly use cardiac surgery ( intravenous , base infusion propofol , versus inhalational , base isoflurane ) different stage surgery . Specific 1 . To compare influence two anesthetic protocol myocardial contractility end surgery . 2 . To assess net change effective arterial elastance produce surgery use cardiopulmonary bypass evaluate possible difference two anesthetic protocol respect change arterial tone . 3 . To evaluate preservation ventriculo-arterial couple two different anesthetic mode .</detailed_description>
