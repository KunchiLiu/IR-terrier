	<brief_summary>This single-arm , open-label , multicenter , dose escalation , phase 1-2 study alisertib ( MLN8237 ) administer patient relapsed refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) /transformed follicular lymphoma ( TFL ) treat rituximab vincristine . The study three part follow : Part 1 , Phase 1 : Safety lead-in cohort evaluate alisertib ( MLN8237 ) rituximab . Part 2 , Phase 1 : Dose escalation cohort evaluate alisertib ( MLN8237 ) + Rituximab + Vincristine determine Phase 2 dose . Patients type B-cell lymphoma ( include mantle cell Burkitt 's lymphoma may enroll Parts 1 2 . Phase 2 : Alisertib ( MLN8237 ) + Rituximab + Vincristine patient relapse refractory DLBCL TFL recommend Phase 2 dose .</brief_summary>
