	<brief_summary>This study determine clinical efficacy BKM120 monotherapy treatment initial recurrent metastatic endometrial cancer first line radio chemotherapy . Clinical efficacy determine non-progression rate 3 2 month depend group patient . The primary endpoint non-progression rate 3 month ( 12 week ) patient group whose disease painless ( low grade tumor = stratum 1 ) non-progression rate 2 month ( 8 week ) group patient aggressive disease ( high grade tumor = stratum 2 ) . Disease progression define RECIST 1.1 criterion</brief_summary>
