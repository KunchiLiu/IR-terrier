	<brief_title>Eltrombopag Thrombocytopenic Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) Patients ( CLL2S Study GCLLSG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study divide Phase I Phase II part . The phase I part use open-label , dose escalation design order find appropriate , feasible dose eltrombopag achieve durable increase platelet count . In phase II , patient randomize ( 2:1 eltrombopag : placebo ) explore efficacy confirm safety identify eltrombopag dose Phase I. Eltrombopag/placebo administer start cycle continue cycle treatment subject finish treatment chemotherapy . The schedule day eltrombopag dose Phase II determine base data analyze Phase I , exceed define maximum tolerable dose ( MTD ) . Severe thrombocytopenia frequently associate hematologic condition patient CLL . In early stage disease , mild thrombocytopenia common approximately 25 % CLL patient . Later disease , bone marrow become extensively infiltrated neoplastic cell , result severe thrombocytopenia . Thrombocytopenia patient CLL could result disease , pack marrow autoimmunity/ITP . For patient CLL develop severe thrombocytopenia , treatment option limit administration platelet transfusion common . Additionally , treatment CLL patient chemotherapy treat disease hamper due severe thrombocytopenia . The clinical consequence severe thrombocytopenia include increased tendency bleeding , probably due thrombocytopenia , compromise hemostasis , delay administration chemotherapy consequence less optimal disease control . Eltrombopag orally bioavailable small molecule TPO receptor ( TPO-R ) agonist develop GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) treatment thrombocytopenia . Eltrombopag show stimulate platelet production elevate platelet count healthy volunteer patient chronic ITP , patient thrombocytopenia relate hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) ( Jenkins , Blood 2007 ; Bussel , NEJM 2007 ; McHutchinson NEJM 2007 ) . The optimal dose eltrombopag thrombocytopenic patient CLL currently unknown . As , one objective study define safe effective dose eltrombopag thrombocytopenic patient CLL prior alkylating agent and/or fludarabine-based therapy . The eltrombopag dos propose administration study 75 mg 300 mg daily . As prerequisite trial , detailed study perform laboratory principal investigator in-vitro effect eltrombopag CLL cell regard cell survival , differentiation proliferation . The result suggest eltrombopag unlikely act growth factor CLL . Therefore clinical trial investigate effect platelet count CLL warrant ( Zenz T. et al. , ASH 2009 ) .</detailed_description>

Able understand comply protocol requirement instruction intend complete study plan . Adequate renal function ( creatinine must exceed upper limit normal ( ULN ) reference range 50 % ) study entry Adequate liver function : bilirubin £ 1.5 time upper limit normal . ALT AST &lt; = 3 time upper limit normal without liver involvement CLL &lt; = 5 time upper limit normal case liver involvement CLL Prothrombin time ( PT/INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) must within 80 120 % normal range history hypercoagulable state Total albumin must lower limit normal ( LLN ) 20 % . Thrombocytopenia primarily cause ITP Refractory CLL : define treatment failure ( failure achieve CR PR ) disease progression within 6 month last fludarabine and/or bendamustine base therapy . NOTE : Subjects refractory rituximab monotherapy last therapy permit No prior therapy CLL Active autoimmune hemolytic anemia ( AIHA ) require corticosteroid therapy &gt; 100mg equivalent hydrocortisone , chemotherapy Platelet count &gt; 50 000/μl screening Richter 's transformation CNS involvement BCLL Active infectious disease require systemic antibiotic , antifungal , antiviral treatment Past current malignancy CLL ( exception basal cell carcinoma skin situ carcinoma cervix breast ) unless tumor successfully treat curative intent least 2 year prior trial entry Clinically significant cardiac disease include unstable angina , acute myocardial infarction within 6 month , congestive heart failure , etc . History significant cerebrovascular disease Recurring venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism Glucocorticoids unless give dos &lt; = 100 mg/day hydrocortisone ( equivalent dose glucocorticoid ) exacerbation CLL ( e.g . asthma ) Known HIV positivity Active hepatitis B , C Treatment investigational drug within 30 day five halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose eltrombopag . Subjects know suspect able comply study protocol Patients recent history arterial venous thrombosis ( stroke , transient ischemic attack , myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism ) within precede 6 month . Patients recurrent arterial venous thromboembolic event .</criteria>
