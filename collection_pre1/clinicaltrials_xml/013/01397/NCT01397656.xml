	<brief_summary>STUDY OBJECTIVES The overall goal study compare bystander fatigue CPR quality 5 minute continuous chest compression versus 2005 30:2 chest compression ventilation Resuscitation Guidelines , population age 55 great . More specifically , investigator compare CPR ratio regard : 1 . The achieved frequency depth chest compression , 2 . Participant rating perceive level exertion . STUDY HYPOTHESIS In population age 55 great , new CPR recommendation lead : 1. le frequent shallower chest compression 5-minute study period ; 2. high rating perceive level exertion compare 2005 30:2 CPR ratio .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bystander Fatigue CPR Quality Using Continuous Compressions Versus 30:2 Compressions Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiac arrest number one cause mortality Canadian population . Out-of-hospital bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) associate 3 4 fold increase survival cardiac arrest , citizen often reluctant initiate CPR mouth-to-mouth component . In effort increase bystander CPR rate community minimize interruption chest compression , 2010 Resuscitation Guidelines change 2005 recommend 30:2 compression ventilation ratio continuous chest compression layman . Although 30:2 ratio meant increase survival cardiac arrest , ability rescuer deliver continuous chest compression never study . Little known impact new recommendation bystander fatigue result CPR quality . Objectives : The overall goal study compare bystander fatigue CPR quality 5 minute continuous chest compression versus 2005 30:2 chest compression ventilation Resuscitation Guidelines population age 55 great . More specifically , investigator compare CPR ratio regard : 1 . The achieved frequency depth chest compression , 2 . Participants ' rating perceive level exertion . Methods : The investigator conduct randomize cross-over trial compare bystander fatigue CPR quality use two different CPR ratio . Intervention : All participant ask perform two 5-minute session CPR manikin - one session use 30:2 ratio , use continuous chest compression . There supervised practice session beginning , rest period . The order session execute determined random fashion . The study population consist volunteer age 55 old , group susceptible perform CPR real victim . The study take place busy public area The Ottawa Hospital , Civic Campus , senior 's activity centre Ottawa . Participants score 3 less validated Clinical Frailty Scale order participate study . Participants physical limitation disease process preclude ability safely perform CPR exclude . Outcome measure : Information age , gender , prior CPR training , measure frailty collect time enrollment . The number , frequency , quality chest compression ( depth release ) measure CPR session use Zoll cardiac monitor ability measure CPR process . Heart rate blood pressure measure CPR session . The participant ask rate level fatigue CPR session use validated Borg Rating Perceived Exertion scale . Sample size : The investigator hope recruit 60 participant . Data analysis Objective # 1 include descriptive statistic pair t-test 95 % confidence interval ; Objective # 2 analyzed use descriptive statistic Wilcoxon Rank Sum test . In addition , exploratory analysis , investigator also assess rate change time number chest compression perform adequately use random coefficient model . This study protocol review OHREB implementation , enter trial registry . Importance study : Data study evaluate bystander fatigue result CPR quality compare 2010 continuous chest compression 2005 30:2 chest compression ventilation Resuscitation Guidelines . This project improve understanding physiological demand associate implementation new CPR Resuscitation Guidelines layman . The investigator anticipate result study widely distribute , help shape 2015 iteration Resuscitation Guidelines .</detailed_description>
