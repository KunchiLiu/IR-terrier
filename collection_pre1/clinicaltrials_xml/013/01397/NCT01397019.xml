	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer ( LAPC ) With Additional Chemo-radiotherapy ( CRT ) Patients With Borderline Resectable Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer ( PC ) third common gastrointestinal malignancy one top ten leading cause cancer death Western world . Patients PC divide three subgroup ; resectable ( rPC ) , locally advanced ( LAPC ) metastatic ( mPC ) . For patient rPC surgery offer best chance long term survival . However estimate 20 % patient rPC time diagnosis . For patient LACP , invasion local large vessel often cause non-resectability . The median survival patient 6 12 month long term survival extremely rare . The optimal treatment LAPC controversial . Treatment strategy vary attempt `` downstage '' tumour rPC , treat patient palliative setting . Phase II study retrospective series evaluate various treatment regimens strategy include chemotherapy radiotherapy ( RT ) alone combination - chemoradiotherapy ( CRT ) . Results trial give clear answer regard best treatment strategy . However , data several study show treatment LAPC may result shrinkage tumour , thus potentially lead resection ; also data suggests CRT chemotherapy improve treatment efficacy . Recent data patient mPC show combination oxaliplatin , irinotecan 5-FU ( FOLFIRINOX ) increase response rate 10 % 30 % median survival 11.1 month . The promising efficacy make natural attempt treatment patient LAPC .</detailed_description>
