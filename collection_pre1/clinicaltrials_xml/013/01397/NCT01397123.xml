	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect six month nutrition intervention , deliver taught classroom teacher in-service nutrition training , prevention overweight obesity among child grade 1 4 . In randomized controlled trial , 464 child seven elementary school allocate six month nutrition educational intervention teacher standard care . Intervened teacher 12 session three hour researcher throughout six month , accord follow topic : nutrition healthy eating ( session 1 4 ) ; importance drinking water ( session 5 ) ; strategy encourage fruit vegetable consumption decrease high energy-density food intake ( session 6 8 ) ; strategy increase physical activity ( session 9 10 ) ; healthy cooking activity ( session 11 12 ) . After session , teacher encourage develop activity class focus learned topic . Sociodemographic , anthropometric , dietary , physical activity assessment perform baseline end intervention . We expect few intervened child become overweight consumption fruit vegetables high . In addition , expect less consumption low-nutrition high dense food . We also expect provide support decrease overweight epidemic , involve classroom teacher train intervention making dedicated interventionists .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity continue increase ( Ogden et al. , 2006 ) grow concern Portugal world . As successful treatment elusive , prevention consider high priority . So , present effort dedicate develop implement overweight obesity prevention intervention ( Gortmaker , et al , 1999 ; James , Tomas &amp; Kerr , 2004 ) , hope multilevel approach , occur early childhood , may improve eat habit physical activity therefore , contribute prevent reverse epidemic state . In school , previously train person perform anthropometric evaluation , use standardized procedure ( WHO Expert Commitee 1995 ) . Anthropometric measurement perform child light indoor clothing barefooted . Weight measure electronic scale , error ±100g ( Seca , Model 703 , Germany ) , height measure use stadiometer , head Frankfort plane . BMI compute mass , Kg/height , m2 . The prevalence underweight , normal weight , overweight obesity calculate accord International Obesity Task Force ( IOTF ) criterion , make correspondence traditional adult cut-off specific value child accord gender age ( Cole et al . 2000 ) . A z-score ( number standard deviation ( SD ) reference population ) calculate child use LMS method calculation determine use LMS growth add-in excel ( Pan Cole 2009 ) . Dietary intake gather 24h dietary recall obtain nutritionist and/or trained interviewer . We assess single recall another intervention . The respondent prior notification recall would occur . Training interviewer include practice use photo food model quantify portion size , experience probe information child without suggest response well type food consume detail fat content , brand name , constituent mixed dish . The 24h dietary recall commonly use dietary assessment method easy administer , perform large-scale study ( Kranz Sie-Riz 2002 , Gomez-Martínez et al . 2009 ) , use ass adequacy energy macronutrient intake . During 24h dietary recall , child ask recall food beverage consume past 24h . Daily routine use prompt ( wake , go bed , time class , school ) enhance recall . Portion size food beverage consume also estimate use food model , photo prop ( cup , glass , food wrapper container ) aid determine serve size . Energy nutritional intake estimate use adapt Portuguese version nutritional analysis software Food Processor Plus ( ESHA Research Inc. , Salem , OR , USA ) . The 24-hour dietary recall interview capture time name eat occasion , food beverage report eating occasion , source item obtain . In order ass level physical activity child , parent ask five question four answer choice ( 4-point scale ) range 0 ( seldom ) 4 ( often ) : ) Outside school child take part organize sport ? b ) Outside school child take part non-organized sport ? c ) Outside school , many time week child take part sport physical activity least 20 minute ? ) Outside school hour , many hour week child usually take part physical activity much get breath sweat ? e ) Does child take part competitive sport ? ( Mota Esculcas 2002 ) . The total sum point compute reach maximum 20 point . To express activity level , Physical Activity Index obtain , divide sample four activity class : sedentary group ( 0-5 ) ; low activity group ( 6-10 ) ; moderately active group ( 11-15 ) ; vigorously active group ( 16-20 ) , basis report physical activity ( Mota Esculcas 2002 ) . Social , demographic family characteristic assess questionnaire . The survey send parent contain question gender age child , education parent ( record five category : 0 , 1-4 , 5-9 , 10-12 , 12 year formal education ) . This information group analysis three category : 9 year , 10-12 year , 12 year education . The research team propose , January 2008 , accreditation session develop teacher Minister Education , Scientific-Pedagogic Council In-service Training ( Conselho Científico Pedagógico da Formação Contínua , Ministério da Educação ) . This proposal approve September 2008 form `` training workshop '' 72 hour duration , distribute active learning strategy ( 36 hour ) work contact child ( 36 hour ) . Teachers intervention group 12 session three hour researcher throughout six month , include follow topic : nutrition healthy eat child family ( session 1 4 ) ; importance water ( session 5 ) ; strategy encourage fruit vegetable consumption decrease high energy density food intake ( session 6 8 ) ; increase physical activity reduce screen time exposure ( session 9 10 ) ; healthy cooking ( session 11 12 ) . After session , teacher resend learned content develop creative engage classroom activity address topic . All question arise implementation classroom activity address resolve shortly researcher . Teachers allow develop refine activity learn strategy propose researcher . At end period , teacher deliver critical report activity focus work contact child . The data analysis perform use SPSS ® , Version 18.0 ( SPSS Inc ; Chicago , IL ) .</detailed_description>
