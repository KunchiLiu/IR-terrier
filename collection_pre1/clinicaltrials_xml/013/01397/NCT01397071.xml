	<brief_summary>Avocados naturally rich antioxidant , beneficial compound , help prevent many disease , like atherosclerosis ( harden artery ) . When food high fat eat , certain harmful compound absorb , lead atherosclerosis . One harmful compound call malondialdehyde , MDA . This compound measure blood urine person eats high fat meal . Antioxidants find herbs spice may lower absorption MDA , could help prevent development atherosclerosis . This study determine whether beneficial compound avocado reduce absorption MDA . This tested ask healthy male eat high fat ground beef patty without avocado measuring amount MDA blood urine sample . Blood flow also measure . Healthy men choose study eat high fat hamburger patty easily mimic condition cause atherosclerosis . Avocadoes rich antioxidiants , show previous study reduce absorption harmful compound , like MDA , form cooking . The result study may help explain high fat food harmful body beneficial antioxidant herbs spice protect body . This determine blood urine sample subject give two different meal : ) plain cooked ground beef patty , b ) avocado cook ground beef patty .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Hass Avocado contain monounsaturated fat , lutein , glutathione , vitamin E , antioxidant . This study determine whether avocado exerts beneficial effect inhibition absorption malondialdehyde ( MDA ) measure lipid peroxidation . In previous study , demonstrate spice antioxidant result 70 percent decrease formation MDA cooking healthy volunteer consume burger make spice excrete 50 percent less MDA urine subject consume control burger make without spice . Since spice add cooking burger , possible ass effect antioxidant stomach . Foods stomach continue form lipid peroxidation product digestion call `` bioreactor '' function stomach . In proposed study know quantity fresh avocado place top burger prior consumption determine whether avocado inhibits formation MDA cook burger meat stomach . Work Aljada et al ( 42 ) demonstrate increase inflammatory oxidative marker mononuclear cell use Western blot analysis NFkB NADPH oxidase subunit follow mixed high calorie meal . Considering rich content bioactives compound avocado , therefore select method endpoint determination well propose randomize , crossover study . We accomplish follow specific aim : 1 . To measure plasma urine malondialdehyde HPLC over6 hour consumption test burger without fresh avocado add prior consumption . 2 . To measure insulin , glucose , triglyceride , TNF-α , IL-6 , IL-8 , NFκB activation , nitric oxide peripheral arterial tonometry test burger . These study add evidence antioxidant lipid phase inhibit formation and/or absorption cytotoxic lipid product malondialdehyde . Ultimately , good understanding role bioactive substance plant food avocado may demonstrate importance plant-based antioxidant human health .</detailed_description>
