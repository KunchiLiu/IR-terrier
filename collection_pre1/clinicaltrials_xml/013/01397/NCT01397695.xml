	<brief_title>Topical Bevacizumab Management Recurrent Epistaxis Patients With Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia ( HHT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plans recruit patient HHT UCSD Nasal Dysfunction Clinic . The HHT world connect HHT Foundation . The Foundation interested VEGF inhibitor . They carefully watch work UCSD long time two paper Avastin circulate around world . Those come evaluation deem appropriate Bevacizumab injection recruit study . Those agree participate sign consent form . The treatment , regardless participation propose research , bring patient operate room general anesthesia nose suction clean blood clot , crust secretion . The mucosa inject local anesthetic adrenaline reduce discomfort reduce bleeding . The nasal mucosa treat KTP laser standard fashion . A 100mg Avastin deliver 4cc dilute 4cc normal saline total volume 8cc . The dilution make know difference treatment rather normally take minimum 8cc properly inject nasal mucosa . The 1 % Bevacizumab inject submucosally throughout nasal cavity spar mucosa cartilage septum . The nasal cavity spray 2cc fibrin sealant ( EVICEL ) reduce postoperative bleeding facilitates heal laser therapy . It nothing Bevacizumab injection . The patient awaken returned recovery room discharge home . Beginning approximately one week patient instruct begin hypertonic pulsatile nasal irrigation . They follow-up clinic 1 month . The data collection form attach . Prior treatment patient complete HHT epistaxis severity score , blood drawn hematocrit , hemoglobin serum feritin level . Women childbearing age urine pregnancy test , require anesthesia Bevacizumab study well . Patients follow monthly first 6 month . At 3 6 month blood test repeat . For live San Diego perform UCSD . For living outside San Diego area repeat primary care physician . For ensue 18 month patient follow monthly either electronically telephone . ESS score calculate . Laboratory test repeat . Patients followed-up time begin re-bleeding ESS score increase either 2 1 point 1 month post-op evaluation . Experience date 20 30 patient bleed cease within 1 2 week . Hence 1 month score optimum result . Adverse event record appropriately report IRB . A new epistaxis severity score ( ESS ) develop test HHT Foundation . We use past several month find excellent measure HHT epistaxis . A copy attach . The minimum sample size 10 patient . Study duration plan 24 month patient recruit include . If few patient recruit study may extend . Data report mean standard deviation . Patients compare individually collectively pretreatment data specifically hematocrit , hemoglobin , serum ferritin epistaxis severity score . All medical information collect UCSD include EPIC electronic medical record . All data maintain de-identified spreadsheet . Patients number 1-99 . A separate database correlate patient number name medical record number keep separately . Both data sheet maintain password protect computer backed-up thumb drive . These maintain within University Medical Center lock office .</detailed_description>
