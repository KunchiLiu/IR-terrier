	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Versus Depo Medrol Lumbar Epidurals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central Epidural Steroid Injections ( ESI ) Selective Nerve Root Blocks ( SNRB ) often use non-surgical treatment lumbar disc herniation lumbar radiculitis ( radiate pain ) . Numerous author report value treat patient radicular pain possibility delay even obviate need surgery well-selected patients.. There two well-performed clinical study peer-reviewed medical literature specifically examine crossover rate surgery patient receive either ESI SNRB . In prospective study , Buttermann et al . find crossover rate surgery patient symptomatic disc herniation treat ESI 54 % ( 27/50 ) . In separate prospective study , Riew et al . follow patient selective nerve root block find similarly 53 % ( 29/55 ) patient avoid surgery selective nerve root block initial follow-up 13-28 month . In later study follow population , 76 % ( 16/21 ) patient avoid surgery one year still avoid surgery minimum five year follow-up . Epidural steroid injection common treatment option patient disc herniation radiate leg pain . They use low back problem since 1922 still integral part non-surgical management variety spine relate problem . The goal injection reduction pain , increase quality life increase function . Most practitioner agree , effect injection tend temporary-providing relief pain one week one year-an epidural beneficial patient acute episode back and/or leg pain . Importantly , injection provide sufficient pain relief allow patient progress rehabilitative stretching exercise program . Many previous study epidural injection include use fluoroscopy xray verify proper placement medication despite fact fluoroscopic guidance routinely use today . Additionally , many study classify patient accord diagnosis tend `` lump '' different type , source pain together . Commonly use steroid preparation include betamethasone , triamcinolone , dexamethasone methylprednisolone . Unfortunately , consensus regard effective medication , dose , volume frequency use ESIs . This investigator-initiated study conduct compare effect epidural injection low back pain use either dexamethasone methylprednisolone ( Depo-Medrol ) . The physician list would like compare two medication ass one effective . Both medication FDA approve experimental . Dexamethasone nonparticulate corticosteroid , rapid onset act anti-inflammatory immunosuppressant . Depo-Medrol synthetic steroid ( cortisone ) medication also act anti-inflammatory physician administer epidural relief low back pain .</detailed_description>
