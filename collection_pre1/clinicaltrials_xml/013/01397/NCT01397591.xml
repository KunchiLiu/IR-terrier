	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give ofatumumab together bortezomib work treat patient relapse diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) , follicular lymphoma ( FL ) , mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) . Monoclonal antibody , ofatumumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving ofatumumab together bortezomib may help kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ofatumumab Bortezomib Subjects With Relapsed CD20+Diffuse Large B Cell , Follicular , Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy , measure overall response ( complete response ( CR ) + partial response ( PR ) ) ofatumumab combination bortezomib subject relapse cluster differentiation ( CD ) 20+ DLBCL , FL MCL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore duration efficacy ofatumumab combination bortezomib population measure progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) disease free survival ( DFS ) . II . To assess response compare prior treatment . III . To assess safety tolerability ofatumumab combination bortezomib patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Correlation trough ofatumumab blood level response . II . Correlation fragment crystallizable receptor ( FcR ) gamma 3 allotype response . OUTLINE : Patients receive ofatumumab intravenously ( IV ) 2.5 hour day 1 8 course 1 , day 1 subsequent course . Patients also receive bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
