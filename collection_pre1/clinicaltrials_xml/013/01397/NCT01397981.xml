	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine well people train produce new different movement use haptic feedback . One particular application retrain individual walk differently order reduce knee joint load prevent treat knee osteoarthritis alternative surgical treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gait Retraining Reduce Knee Osteoarthritis Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During movement retrain session , give different combination haptic , visual , auditory feedback order inform desire movement change . This take place Human Performance Laboratory Stanford University . Motion analysis do perform movement activity ( locomotion ) . Prior perform movement task investigator attach reflective marker body use tape , pre-wrap and/or ace bandage . The investigator record motion body 's movement use infrared camera capture anatomical data reflective marker body . The investigator provide feedback inform desire movement modification . Haptic feedback device vibration motor skin stretch device attach body via velcro strap use give `` touch '' feedback . There computer monitor front test provide visual feedback . Sounds played use speaker near test area provide auditory feedback . The time need set performance set test approximately 90 minute . You perform walk movement small part time . The rest time spend prepare experiment . After investigator examine movement data , data appear inaccurate investigator unable process data , investigator may ask repeat movement analysis later time .</detailed_description>
