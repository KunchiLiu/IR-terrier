	<brief_summary>Proximal forearm fracture comprise approximately 5 % fracture , olecranon fracture account almost 20 % thes fracture . There limited conclusive evidence regard optimal treatment outcome fracture within elderly population one case series literature describe 13 patient . Our trial include patient equal age 75yrs present Edinburgh Fife Orthopaedic Trauma Units isolate olecranon fracture . Patients consent enrol trial randomise operative fixation use one two treatment method . Patients nonoperative group place sling two week allow mobilise supervise physiotherapy per normal protocol . For patient operative group , tension band wire plate fixation employ depend choice supervise consultant . Patients evaluate one year period follow treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Non-operative Versus Operative Management Olecranon Fractures Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undisplaced olecranon fracture treat non-operatively . The aims treatment displace olecranon fracture restoration function stability elbow joint4 . The technique employ allow preservation reconstruction articular surface minimal associate complication . Tension-band wiring ( TBW ) recognise commonly use fixation method , although plate fixation intramedullary screw fixation note alternative . Potential problem TBW technique wind breakdown , infection , prominent metalwork , malunion non-union . Furthermore , plate fixation consider superior distal/comminuted/oblique fracture fracture-dislocations , superior fracture reduction fixation result , well low rate re-operation . The described fixation technique employ elderly people , although difficulty associate fixation osteoporotic bone , wound breakdown complication report . In patient , fracture excision advancement triceps viable option fixation deem inappropriate . However , limited evidence suggest non-operative treatment displace olecranon fracture elderly patient may provide adequate functional result . In case series 13 patient ( mean age 81.8 year , &gt; 5 mm fracture displacement ) treat non-operatively displaced olecranon fracture , outcome score excellent 11 patient poor one . Research Aim To determine difference exist outcome ( primary measure - DASH score ) one year non-operative management AND operative treatment olecranon fracture patient 75yrs old ( ≥75yrs ) . Methodology This trial involve identify patient age 75yrs ( ≥75yrs ) present Edinburgh Orthopaedic Trauma Unit Fife Orthopaedic Trauma Unit isolate olecranon fracture . Patients consent enrol trial randomise one two recognise treatment technique - non-operative management collar cuff two week OR operative management use tension band wire fixation plate fixation . The trial commence ethical approval grant Lothian Research Ethics Committee . All statistical analysis was/will perform Dr Rob Elton . Prior study power analysis determine number patient require trial . The primary outcome measure DASH score , continuous variable follow normal ( Gaussian-shaped ) distribution . This study design determine clinically relevant mean difference 10 point two cohort one year enrolment . A power analysis indicate total sample size 50 ( 25 group ) subject provide 80 % statistical power detect significant difference ( 0.05 ) DASH score , assume effect size 0.8 ( mean difference 10 point , standard deviation 12 point ) use unpaired t-test . To account possible loss follow-up 25 % , anticipate enrol 35 subject cohort total sample size 70 subject . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . All patient present unit fracture olecranon satisfy inclusion criterion invite participate study . Vulnerable population recruit . A qualified member on-call team introduce study patient initiate inform consent . If patient agrees , research fellow ( Trauma Orthopaedic StR3 level ) , involve patient 's care review study protocol detail address question patient may . If patient willing participate , research fellow complete inform consent patient . Patients give copy consent form , informed participation voluntary withdraw time study without detriment normal care way . Patients may take long like consider participation , provide still meet eligibility criterion document . Patients willing participate study get care fracture patient decide participate study . On enrolment , data collection form start demographic injury-related information collect . Patients randomise ( perform Dr Rob Elton use close opaque envelope ) one two group ( non-operative operative ) . Patients non-operative group place collar cuff two week allow mobilise supervise physiotherapy per normal protocol . Patients group place cast ( ~60 degree flexion ) pain severe . For patient operative group , tension band wire plate fixation employ depend choice supervise consultant . Following surgery , post-operative assessment course per normal protocol patient study . Patients operative group immobilise depend fracture fixation surgery decision make treat surgeon . Physiotherapy arrange require All follow-up assessment take place follow-up visit initially treat consultant surgeon 's team dedicate member research team . Radiographs diagnostic study obtain discretion treat surgeon differ routine clinical care . Follow-up assessment collect one year period ( 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month one year ) . Routine follow-up institution patient sustain olecranon fracture manage operatively involves outpatient clinic review radiographs 2 week , 6 week , three month six month . Therefore , one additional visit 1 year require study additional radiograph . Radiographs perform one year clinical indication . At visit physical examination , treatment , complication re-operation ( e.g . hardware removal ) , patient record . A member research team , blind treatment method stick plaster entry position , undertake functional testing assessment . By statistically analyse outcome score two group , I aim well determine optimal management fracture age group . Using univariate analysis multivariate regression analysis I determine significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) predictor outcome relation functional outcome score ( DASH one year ) .</detailed_description>
