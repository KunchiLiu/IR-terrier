	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety , tolerability immunogenicity two dose level ( 1x10^10 5x10^10 virus particle ( vp ) ) adenovirus serotype ( Ad ) Ad35.CS.01/Ad26.CS.01 prime-boost malaria candidate vaccine , follow evaluation protective efficacy high dose level experimental malaria challenge . The study 3 phase : 1. dose escalation / vaccination phase dose level test 2. malaria challenge phase subject receive Ad35.CS.01/Ad26.CS.01 5x10^10 vp dose level , together six infectivity control subject , expose experimental challenge Plasmodium falciparum 3. long term follow phase subject receive active vaccine dose level and/or malaria challenge include</brief_summary>
