	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome ( MS ) , type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) obesity world 's prevalent lifestyle disease . This unfortunate development mainly cause lifestyle choice lead obesity due physical inactivity excessive calorie intake . Vegetables important part human diet major source biologically active substance determine nutritional quality food , color , taste , smell , antioxidative , anticarcinogenic , antihypertensive , anti-inflammatory , antihyperglycemia , immunostimulating cholesterol-lowering property . Diet , one aspect lifestyle , think one modifiable variable risk factor development MS T2D , information need component diet could protective development progression MS T2D complication . The study carry 3-month randomize control parallel intervention study involve 60 subject T2D . During fall year 2011 30 ( 10 group ) subject participate remain 30 subject ( 10 group ) fall 2012 . The subject randomize 3 different diet : 1 . A ) `` A healthy Nordic diet '' high content bitter strong tasting vegetable cabbage . 2 . B ) `` A healthy Nordic diet '' high content sweet mild taste vegetable cabbage . 3 . C ) A diet habitually consume Nordic country ( normal control diet ) . The subject group A B consume 500 g root vegetable cabbage daily hand week . The participant visit study clinic screening , weekly intervention period ( 12 week ) .

During first ( week 0 ) third ( week 12 ) major visit 120 minute oral glucose tolerance test include collect blood analyze glucose , insulin triglyceride . The study contribute understanding impact diet high level root vegetable cabbage either high low level phytochemical . Furthermore , result use develop new recommendation target T2D MS subject , thereby contribute healthy lifestyle prevent development progression lifestyle disease . The overall perspective MAXVEG project enhance consumption production bitter strong taste health promote root vegetable cabbage high phytochemical content high consumer preference target specific consumer group</detailed_description>
