	<detailed_description>Vaccines infectious disease instrumental improvement human health remain pillar modern public health strategy . Yet serious life threaten infection include HIV , malaria tuberculosis remain global problem pandemic disease like influenza continue threaten human life . As well , vaccine pursue area cancer prevention treatment . A fundamental barrier prevent effective vaccine many disease conventional protein base vaccine elicit critical requirement T-cell mediate immunity . One approach generate improved T-cell response vaccine identify new protein target candidate . This approach result significant advance vaccine development . We interest novel approach combine specific immune stimulant , adjuvant , vaccine target optimize enhance desire T-cell immune response . The development study novel adjuvant like GLA allow u investigation dendritic cell target vaccine lead improved vaccine many diverse disease . Toll-Like Receptor ( TLR ) Background The TLR 's type 1 transmembrane receptor share leucine-rich repeat domain ( LRR ) extracellular loop Toll/IL-1 receptor ( TIR ) homology domain intracellular tail . The importance TLRs host defense immunity first appreciate Drosophila become susceptible fungal infection follow genetic deletion toll gene . Mammalian homologs identify soon use mouse strain well know highly susceptible Gram-negative infection hyporesponsive lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) . These mouse find mutational change TLR4 gene , render non-functional discovery solidify existence importance Toll proteins mammal . Mice genetic deletion TLR4 demonstrate importance TLR bacterial infection provide clear evidence TLR4 specific Gram negative infection . Currently 10 functional TLRs discover human extensive research identify number pathogen-derived agonist specific TLRs . It generally accept TLR 's function recognize conserve structure organism pathogen associate molecular pattern ( PAMPs ) . Clearly innate receptor critical survive microbial insult provide first line defense dependent generate specific T-cell B-cell response , process take week . Despite clear role innate immunity , evidence accumulate TLR stimulation potent influence development T B cell mediate immunity activation maturation dendritic cell ( DC ) . This knowledge lead development TLR-based vaccine adjuvant activate mature DC . Monocyte Dendritic Cell Overview Dendritic cell ( DC ) part innate adaptive immune system reside host-microbial interface include surface gut , lung within skin . These cell constantly survey environment search microbial pathogen expression several family pattern recognition receptor ( PRR ) include Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) . Immature DC particularly efficient antigen uptake processing , activate DC mature become potent antigen present cell T-lymphocytes . Importantly , immature DC potential induce immune tolerance delete antigen specific T cell , result immune response . Activated DC however direct immune response release particular cytokine . Different initial stimulus influence DC drive CD4+ T-cells differentiate along divergent functional pathway include Th1 , Th2 , Th17 Treg . Therefore , DC critical appropriate innate host defense well orchestrate adaptive response . Given pivotal role host defense , DC relatively rare cell , steady state , develop independently blood cell . Enhancing direct function quantity DC provide benefit host defense well vaccine science . The Steinman lab pioneer novel method vaccination target antigen interest specifically DC population . DC-targeted vaccine show promise animal model DC-targeted HIV vaccine recently administer human first time . Monocytes abundant cell type account approximately 10 % blood leukocyte humans 4 % mouse . Monocytes peripheral blood effector cell participate host defense efficient scavenge cell . They serve precursor tissue macrophage . In human , 3 subset monocyte propose base cell surface expression CD14 CD16 , 2 subset exist mouse mark CD115 Ly6C . The role subset innate immunity require investigation . Evidence suggest monocyte induced differentiate DC , however definitive vivo evidence previously lack . Recent work Steinman lab show vivo authentic DC rapidly differentiate mobilized large monocyte pool time acute inflammation infection . This rapid re-deployment could induce either gram-negative bacteria LPS entirely dependent TLR4 . Similarly , human monocytes de induced differentiate DC , however understanding process limit vitro cell culture large gap understand vivo human monocyte derived-DC . Preliminary data suggest GLA administration mouse , like LPS , mobilize monocyte pool become Mo-DC . It unknown human monocyte vivo rapidly expand DC population follow administration TLR4 adjuvant GLA . Understanding mechanisms re-deployment understanding rapidly expand harness utility DC use adjuvant . Ultimately , anticipate adjuvant-specific DC response improve T-cell immunity enhance vaccine effectiveness . Rationale Investigating Adjuvant Isolation The standard adjuvant trial consist adjuvant investigation combine know licensed vaccine isolation . However , previously describe , hopeful GLA may become important adjuvant DC-targeted HIV vaccine currently development . The DC represent potent antigen-presenting cell specifically target antigen interest cell generate improve immune response . However important consideration target antigen DC . Immature unstimulated DC encounter antigen ability delete antigen specific T cell thereby cause tolerance DC-targeted antigen vaccine alone may cause immune tolerance . In contrast DC mature able induce potent effector T cell response target antigen . DC activate TLR stimulation therefore combine TLR stimulate DC maturation DC-targeted antigen would result optimal T cell mediate immunity . In theory DC-targeted vaccine could never give without DC mature adjuvant specific effect action GLA would know unless study first isolation . To plan eventual DC-targeted HIV vaccine trial adjuvant , also critical know temporal immune effect isolate GLA . GLA Background Information GLA new completely synthetic lipid A ( active component natural LPS ) molecule combine 6 acyl chain single phosphorylation site . The advantage LPS-like molecule purify bacterial source thereby allow homogenous solution contain molecule 6 acyl chain . This important 6 acyl chain result maximal TLR4 activation lipid A molecules 5 7 acyl chain 100 time less active 4 acyl chain immuno-inhibitory . MPL exist TLR4 vaccine adjuvant derive salmonella LPS represent heterogeneous mixture 3 , 4 , 5 6 acylated molecule . MPL induces effective humoral antibody response vaccination , generate CD4 T-cell immunity , make undesirable adjuvant many protein-based vaccine . In animal model GLA add Fluzone vaccine improve humoral cellular immunity influenza . GLA test human safety combination influenza vaccine however individual effect study . Particularly isolated effect cytokine , chemokine gene regulation human know monocyte subset previously investigate . The optimal formulation route administration know ; therefore major component investigation determine safe tolerable formulation route . GLA administer human combination Fluzone vaccine range dos 0.5μg 5μg intramuscularly ; however test isolation , oil-in-water stable emulsion ( GLA-SE ) use . Fluzone reactogenic vaccine dose-limiting toxicity occur 3 4 patient receive Fluzone + high dose GLA-SE ( 5μg ) , good safety profile observe 0.5-2.5μg . The stable emulsion ( SE ) contain squalene use 2 % ( vol : vol ) . We continue use percentage GLA-SE formulation . A second formulation GLA subsequently develop avoid need emulsion ; GLA-AF aqueous theoretically reduce side-effect profile less reactogenicity GLA-SE . We plan compare two formulation GLA isolation ; GLA-SE ( stable emulsion ) GLA-AF ( aqueous formulation ) . GLA-AF never administer human therefore version represent first-in-human trial . For safety reason GLA-AF injection must separate day since possible know receive GLA-AF , inject first nine subject cohort one day apart . Due complexity number group study , enroll complete route sequentially cohort . The subcutaneous cohort first group screen , enrol , randomize inject , follow intramuscular . Summary This study phase-1 , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded clinical trial compare GLA formulation administration route human . Safety tolerability different formulation ( GLA-SE vs. GLA-AF ) rout ( SC , IM , ID ) primary focus . Our second focus detail global immune response measure systemic cytokine , chemokines global gene regulation . The third focus investigate effect GLA peripheral blood immune cell include monocyte dendritic cell . This study add first-in-human data GLA-AF detail isolate effect GLA innate immune system . The result trial lay foundation true adjuvant trial use GLA + antigen ultimately use GLA adjuvant DC-targeted vaccine human .</detailed_description>
