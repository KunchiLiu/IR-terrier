	<detailed_description>Life expectancy continuously increase Italy . Aging generally link adaptive modification organ system reduce functional reserve increase vulnerability disease addiction . This framework constitute condition `` frailty '' , associate increase risk multiple adverse event fall , fracture , disability , institutionalisation death . To reduce burden disability disease affect quality life elderly , time weighs heavily health cost , high level managerial efficiency achieve , plan necessary health care service implement measure prevent disability fragile elderly . Indeed strongly expand area gerontological geriatric research focus successful aging , characterise low probability disease related disability , high level physical cognitive functionality active social involvement daily life . For reason project base implementation validated system comprehensive geriatric assessment able provide detail measure different possible interaction among risk factor . The study aim descriptive-epidemiological collection health condition older in-patients different INRCA research hospital ( Italy ) . The data set include personal data , information comprehensive geriatric assessment , clinical-care , biological diagnostic data , collect routinely well ad hoc hospitalisation . Moreover , blood sample take perform biomarkers genetic analysis .</detailed_description>
