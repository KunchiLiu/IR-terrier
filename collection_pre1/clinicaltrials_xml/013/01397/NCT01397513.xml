	<brief_summary>The fibrin network important component arterial thrombus structure influence degradation form clot . A tighter less permeable fibrin network , less susceptible fibrinolysis , form patient manifest cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) condition associate increase risk atherothrombotic complication . In previous study show reduce fibrin network permeability patient type 1 diabetes , may contribute increase risk CVD . Low dose aspirin treatment standard management CVD ; however , effect seem reduced patient diabetes . Our previous study show aspirin treatment alters fibrin network non-diabetic individual increase fibrin network permeability . The effect aspirin fibrin network formation patient diabetes unclear . We hypothesize patient type 1 diabetes might need high dos aspirin recommend low dose ( 75mg ) treatment gain effect fibrin network permeability , effect aspirin treatment fibrin network patient influenced glycemic control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Aspirin Treatment Fibrin Network Formation Patients With Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes associate increased platelet activation , elevate plasma fibrinogen level impair fibrinolysis , factor may contribute elevate risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) patient . Increased platelet activation patient diabetes reflect elevated level platelet microparticles , small circulating procoagulant vesicle shed platelet membrane upon activation . CVD patient may start early age 25-30 year course often aggressive poor prognosis . Treatment daily low dose acetylsalicylic acid ( aspirin 75 mg ) one cornerstones management CVD non-diabetic patient ; however , effect seem reduced patient diabetes . The mechanism behind treatment failure aspirin diabetes patient unclear . Aspirin complex drug multiple effect . The well know acetylation inhibition platelet cyclooxygenase ( COX ) , COX-independent mechanism may also importance protection cardiovascular complication . One mechanism alteration fibrin/fibrinogen property fibrin network structure , possibly acetylation lysine residue fibrinogen molecule involve crosslinking fibrin . The fibrin network structure seem important development atherothrombotic event , individual high risk CVD , include patient type 1 diabetes , well patient manifest CVD tighter less permeable fibrin network structure . The altered fibrin network patient type 1 diabetes may part due increase fibrinogen glycation , may occur lysine residue . Treatment aspirin increase fibrin network permeability non-diabetic subject . However , effect aspirin fibrin network permeability patient diabetes unclear . Possible competition acetylation glycation lysine residue fibrinogen molecule might contribute reduce preventive effect aspirin management CVD patient diabetes high dos aspirin might therefore required patient . Our hypothesis glycation acetylation occur bind site fibrinogen molecule . Thus , poor glycemic control increase glycation may lead low acetylation fibrinogen molecule good glycemic control turn lead alter fibrin network . The aims present study analyse effect low ( 75 mg ) high dose ( 320 mg ) aspirin treatment fibrin network formation patient type 1 diabetes ( primary aim ) , investigate possible influence glycemic control ( secondary aim ) . As platelet microparticles may influence fibrin formation [ 17 , 18 ] since aspirin well-known effect platelet function , also measure plasma concentration platelet microparticles .</detailed_description>
