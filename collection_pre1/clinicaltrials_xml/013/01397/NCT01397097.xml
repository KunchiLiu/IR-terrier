	<criteria>Signed date informed consent Healthy female subject need contraception Age : 18 35 year ( inclusive ) Screening visit Normal clinically insignificant cervical smear require follow ( cervical smear take screen visit normal result document within previous six month ) . HPV test subject ASCUS use adjunctive test . Subjects ASCUS include negative highrisk HPV strain . History regular cyclic menstrual period determine subject 's history , subject regular menstrual cycle ( length cycle 21 35 day ) . ( Subject 's history use hormonal contraceptive sufficient , washout period require ) . Subject willing able attend schedule study visit comply study procedure . Pregnancy currently lactate Vaginal delivery , cesarean delivery abortion within 6 week prior Screening visit . Note : Postpartum LCS12 insertion postpone uterus fully involuted , however earlier 6 week delivery . If involution substantially delay , consider wait 12 week postpartum . Infected abortion postpartum endometritis within 3 month prior Screening visit . Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding . Acute low genital tract infection ( successfully treat ) Acute history recurrent , pelvic inflammatory disease . Congenital acquire uterine anomaly distortion uterine cavity ( e.g . fibroid ) , opinion investigator designee , would cause problem insertion , retention , removal LCS12 . ( Note : preinsertion ultrasound necessary . However , base subject history physical exam finding , suspicion uterine anomaly distortion uterine cavity , appropriate diagnostic measure take prior randomization ) History , diagnose suspect genital malignancy , untreated cervical dysplasia . Clinically significant endometrial polyp ( ) , opinion investigator designee , may interfere assessment bleed profile study . ( Note : preinsertion ultrasound necessary . However , base subject history physical exam finding , suspicion polyp , appropriate diagnostic measure take prior randomization . ) Has previously fail screening study Any disease condition may worsen hormonal treatment accord assessment opinion investigator . The following example condition disease : Cardiovascular Presence history venous arterial thrombotic/thromboembolic event ( e.g. , deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , myocardial infarction ) cerebrovascular accident , include prodromi ( e.g . transient ischemic attack , angina pectoris ) Repeated measurement systolic blood pressure &gt; 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg . Liver Presence history liver tumor ( benign malignant ) Presence history severe hepatic disease long liver function value return normal Jaundice and/or pruritus relate cholestasis ( Gilbert 's syndrome except ) History cholestatic jaundice associate pregnancy previous COC use Other disease : Malignant premalignant disease ( exclude melanoma ) History migraine focal neurologic symptom Any disease condition might interfere conduct study interpretation result Clinically significant ovarian cyst ( define abnormal nonfunctional cyst ) ( Note : preinsertion ultrasound necessary . However , base subject history physical exam finding , suspicion clinically significant cyst , appropriate diagnostic measure take prior randomization . ) Any disease condition compromise function body system could result altered absorption , excessive accumulation , impaired metabolism alter excretion study medication Other contraceptive method : Sterilization Use longacting injectable sexhormone preparation within 10 month prior Randomization visit . The use non study oral , vaginal , transdermal hormonal contraception , intrauterine device ( IUDs ) without hormonal release , implant prohibit treatment .</criteria>
