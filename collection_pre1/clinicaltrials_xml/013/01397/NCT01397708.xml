	<brief_summary>This research study involve two investigational drug , Activator Ligand ( INXN-1001 ) combination Adenovirus Vector Engineered Express hIL-12 ( INXN-2001 ) . IL-12 protein may improve body 's natural response disease enhance ability immune system kill tumor cell may interfere blood flow tumor . The main purpose study evaluate safety tolerability tumor injection INXN-2001 give combination different dose INXN-1001 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Adenovirus Vector Engineered Express hIL-12 Combination With Activator Ligand Treat Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single-arm , open label , Phase I/II dose escalation study intratumoral injection INXN-2001 oral INXN-1001 subject unresectable Stage III IV melanoma . Four sequential dose escalation cohorts INXN-1001 combination fix dose INXN-2001 plan . Subject enrollment dose escalation proceed accord standard 3+3 design . Approximately 15 additional subject enrol expansion cohort single dose level MTD . - Safety tolerability assess incidence severity adverse event . - The antitumor activity study treatment assess accord RECIST v1.1 guideline . Additional assessment anti-tumor activity explore base total measurable tumor burden . - Immunological biological marker response include examination tumor biopsy sample , cytokine level , peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) antibody response INXN-2001 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female race ≥ 18 year age , provide write informed consent prior complete study specific procedure . Unresectable Stage III Stage IV melanoma arise site ocular melanoma . A minimum 2 accessible nonvisceral lesion ( short diameter ≥1 cm ) palpable tumorinvolved lymph node ( short diameter ≥1.5 cm ) . ECOG performance status 0 1 ( Appendix 1 ) . Adequate bone marrow , liver , renal function . An expected survival least approximately 6 month . Male female subject must agree use highly reliable method birth control ( expect failure rate le 5 % per year ) screen visit 28 day last dose study drug . Any prior anticancer therapy investigational agent within 28 day prior first dose study drug . ( NOTE : For expansion cohort ONLY , subject receive ipilimumab , 90day washout period since last dose ipilimumab require . If subject receive immunomodulating therapy ( eg , antiPD1 antibody ) , medical monitor contact evaluation make . ) Clinically significant infection require systemic antibacterial , antifungal , antiviral therapy within 2 week first dose study drug . History HIV infection . Active autoimmune disease require steroid ( &gt; 10 mg prednisone comparable ) immunosuppressive therapy ( e.g. , methotrexate , etc. ) . Documented symptomatic brain metastasis . Screening brain lesion CT MRI require potential subject ; however , neurological sign symptom consistent brain metastasis , brain CT MRI perform clinically indicate . Any medication induce , inhibit substrate CYP450 3A4 within 7 day prior first dose study drug . Prior history hematopoietic stem cell transplant organ allograft . Other concurrent clinically active malignant disease , exception cancer skin . Females nurse pregnant . Subjects history hypersensitivity may relate component study drug , e.g . benzoic acid since INXN1001 contain two benzene ring . Unstable clinically significant concurrent medical condition would , opinion investigator , jeopardize safety subject and/or compliance protocol .</criteria>
