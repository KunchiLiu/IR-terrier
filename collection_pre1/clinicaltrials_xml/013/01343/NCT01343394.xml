	<brief_summary>The objective study : 1 . To see autologous human umbilical cord blood treatment safe child acquire hearing loss , 2 . To determine late functional outcome improve follow autologous human umbilical cord blood treatment child acquire hearing loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Autologous Human Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Fraction Treat Acquired Hearing Loss Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acquired sensorineural hearing loss characterize loss function hair cell Organ Corti , great hair cell loss correlate severe hearing impairment . Children sensorineural hearing loss experience difficulty develop normal language usually lead poor academic social development . Currently , reparative therapeutic option available , treatment design augment diminish function injure Organ Corti . Pre-clinical data suggest progenitor cell infusion may enhance intrinsic repair mechanism Organ Corti may restore hair cell . This treatment could ultimately lead hear improvement . Human umbilical cord blood ( hUCB ) available , autologous , stored progenitor cell population available potential therapeutic use . The primary objective study determine safety autologous hUCB infusion child acquire hearing loss . The secondary objective determine functional , physiologic anatomic outcome improve follow hUCB treatment patient population .</detailed_description>
