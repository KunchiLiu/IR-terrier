	<brief_summary>Our purpose study determine whether bright light therapy effective reduce incidence duration delirium compare usual treatment patient Intensive Care Unit . Our hypothesis bright light therapy effective reduce incidence duration delirium patient Intensive Care Unit Patients assign chamber without bright light therapy . This assignment base occupation ICU bed availability nurse therefore independent patient characteristic . Patients include follow inclusion criterion exclusion criterion . Patients assign chamber bright light therapy receive light therapy three hour morning , eight o'clock till eleven o'clock . The Confusion Assessment Method-score ( CAM-score ) Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale-score ( RASS-score ) perform three time one day ICU nurse , accord exist routine . Besides , extra CAM-score clinical assessment perform day train non-clinician , determine presence delirium . The use sedatives , haldol fixation register determine occurrence , duration severity delirium . Eventually important outcome clinical assessment patient , CAM-score use haldol . The primary outcome study duration delirium , define number day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Light Therapy Confusion Patients Intensive Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intensive Care patient experience severe alteration sleep . They may develop circadian rhythm sleep disorder , characterize irregular sleep/wake pattern . The presence abnormal sleep/wake cycle may risk factor delirium , would link high morbidity , mortality longer ICU stay . Bright light therapy treatment choice circadian rhythm sleep disorder may helpful handle delirium . The objective study determine whether bright light therapy effective reduce incidence duration delirium Intensive Care Unit . This prospective , single center cohort investigation witch influence bright light therapy incidence duration delirium examine compare environmental light . This study take place ICU OLVG , level three ICU 24 bed teach hospital . Patients assigned chamber without bright light therapy . This assignment base occupation ICU bed availability nurse therefore independent patient characteristic . All patient 18 year older admit Intensive Care Unit Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis , Amsterdam include study . Patients diagnose bipolar disorder exclude participation . Other exclusion criterion use antipsychotic drug home environment , temporary permanent loss total vision participation study previous admission Intensive Care Unit . Patients assign chamber bright light therapy receive light therapy three hour morning , eight o'clock till eleven o'clock . The Confusion Assessment Method-score ( CAM-score ) Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale-score ( RASS-score ) perform three time one day ICU nurse , accord exist routine . Besides , extra CAM-score clinical assessment perform day train non-clinician , determine presence delirium . The use sedatives , haldol fixation register determine occurrence , duration severity delirium . Eventually important outcome clinical assessment patient , CAM-score use haldol . At Intensive Care Unit Onze Lieve Vrouwe Gasthuis , Amsterdam , light therapy use nurse optimize light intensity work environment , well prevention sleep disturbance . The light therapy also randomly use treatment Intensive Care patient , though effectiveness functionality subject investigation . Our purpose study determine whether bright light therapy effective reduce incidence duration delirium Intensive Care Unit . The primary outcome study duration delirium , define number day . This derive clinical assessment CAM-scores , perform trained non-clinician .</detailed_description>
