	<brief_summary>Intend use : A blood test Cancer Associated Auto Antibodies ( CAAA ) aim well diagnostic management suspect subject breast pathology Study Description : Blood collect form patient serum test presence CAAA experimental test kit . Objectives : To assess effectiveness CAAA test . Patient Population : The study population include woman suspect breast mass detect conventional method , schedule biopsy , result pathological verification suspect mass . Target Population : The target population woman suspect breast mass detect conventional method , today , schedule biopsy . Structure : Subjects enrol study check presence CAAAb , result CAAAb test compare pathology submit physician participate center . Sample Size : Total 1000 sample , 620 sample ensure least 124 true positive breast cancer subject verify biopsy , 124 true negative breast cancer subject verify biopsy . Additional 400 sample use calibration train set . ( Multi center study , statistical rationale provide ) . Primary Effectiveness Variables : The effectiveness test define specificity test conditionally sensitivity low pre-defined level 95 % . Endpoint : The endpoint study show effectiveness high 50 % . Study Sponsor : Eventus Diagnostics Ltd. Clinical Monitor : For site dedicate CRO appoint monitor clinical trial .

	<detailed_description>General Information : Since mutation normal cell lead malignancy , involve change structure function cell , could assume immune system recognize change antigenic determinates respond . For many year , investigator try distinguish cancer patient healthy population difference specific autoantibody level . In healthy population , baseline amount autoantibody determine , patient population statistically significant high level autoantibody . Many example method find scientific literature [ example reference - Naora et.al . ( 2001 ) ; mintz et . Al . ( 2003 ) ; Korneeva et . Al ( 2000 ) ] . The presence autoantibodies population different level make difficult find specifically discriminate antibody . To date , specific autoantibody distinguish solely healthy cancer patient ( oppose autoimmune disease , specific autoantibody find high level patient ) . Our work assumes specific Autoantibodies expression level alter cancer , thus difference indicate presence / absence cancer . In experiment protocol , check difference expression level specific autoantibody suspect breast pathology . Future CAAA Test Intend use - Identification specific breast CAAAs , could provide clinician additional immunological antigenic information regard patient 's condition medical status . Test major step component - The CAAA test comprise blood collection process step follow detection specific auto antibody ELISA base assay mathematical processing , subsequent classification result `` positive '' `` negative '' breast cancer . Study Population : The study population include woman schedule pathological cytological confirmation either kind biopsy cytology , prior anti-cancer treatment . The clinical suspicion include one following : positive mammography/US/MRI , suspect physical check . Final verification ( `` true positive '' `` true negative '' ) do relation pathology/cytology . Subject Selection : The `` true positive '' group consist sequential patient satisfy inclusion criterion positive biopsy result . The `` true negative '' group consist sequential patient satisfy inclusion criterion negative biopsy result . Written informed consent must obtain prior obtain blood sample patient . This study base multi-centers participation . The minimum number site study 2 . All site within Hospitals either surgery department relevant specific unit responsible provide care BC patient . The protocol monitoring routine apply site . All CRF data submit electronically dedicate secure internet site , change track . When perform CAAA test , Lab/ Sponsor team information regard nature sample . This pathological information provide statistical evaluation parallel CAAA test . STUDY DESIGN : Overall Description - The current study single blind case-control validation study , involve consecutive breast cancer subject positive biopsy result ( true positive ) equal number patient negative biopsy result ( true negative ) . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness CAAA test . The effectiveness study define specificity CAAA test pre define sensitivity 95 % . The study evaluate sensitivity CAAA test show declare level 95 % . The study evaluate specificity CAAA test new study population . According known result PPV mammography various population assume study population include 30 % true positive cancer case . As today , large proportion suspect subject diagnose final pathology biopsy . In study , true positive true negative case ( verified biopsy ) compare CAAA test result . Study Procedures In hospital : First , identify study subject sign inform consent form , Eligibility Form fill , bar-coded . Subjects ' clinical information acquire patient 's medical file , include age , medical history result test do lead diagnostic evaluation breast cancer record appropriate , bar-coded , pre-study case report form . The report electronic via dedicate secured internet site , change database record traceable . A hard copy record keep department . The study anonymous Department keep name patient without revel investigator study sponsor . The doctor/ nurse/ phlebotomist collect heparin vacuum tube ( 8ml ) , label ( bar-code ) . The tube blood package double sealed container . The blood transport room temperature ( 18-25Â°C ) , accord relevant regulation , laboratory . Transportation time 6 hour . The blood handle laboratory collect serum accord protocol , serum keep frozen -80 , properly label aliquot . The frozen sample send diagnostic laboratory antibody test . In diagnostic laboratory ELISA base test detection Auto Antibodies relative expression ratio , conduct sample accord lab protocol . The sample test antibody level antigen identify previous training set . All data permanently record directly dedicate computer . For sample antibody result put coded patient file . A mathematical algorithm determine sample positive negative . At Hospital , post biopsy : 2-3 week biopsy , CRO collect patient 's file result pathology lab relevant information nature suspect mass . These result record dedicated secure internet site print bar-coded CRF keep Department . The hospital preserve slice suspect mass ( either biopsy surgery ) future immuno-histochemical study conduct sponsor . The final pathology compare CAAA test result . The result analyze statistician expertise cancer population study . The patient include study undergo blood test , risk involve blood collection . As treatment affect result , risk subject patient participate study . As study conduct link individual patient , immediate benefit derive additional test run blood sample . Future benefit may derive development assay . The current study blind prospective validation study , involve consecutive suspect breast pathology subject schedule biopsy study duration . The purpose study assess sensitivity specificity CAAA test detection breast cancer woman schedule biopsy . Subjects screen potential participation study , accord inclusion exclusion criterion . The data include parameter clinical pathological state subject result CAAA ELISA . There two goal study . 1 . To test sensitivity CAAA pre-defined level . 2 . To evaluate specificity CAAA test . Statistical Hypothesis The main condition determine sample size validate sensitivity test lower predefined level . The classification rule establish way sensitivity training set 100 % . We assume real sensitivity lower 99 % . Null Hypothesis : The sensitivity test high 95 % . Alternative hypothesis : The sensitivity test le 99 % . Data Management A database management system shall design maintain , include screen preparation , edit check program . Pre-entry post-entry quality control clinical data shall perform data entry center . All ELISA test result uploaded database via internet base interface , lock change . In order change ELISA test result , unlocking database require consent local CRO , sponsor site physician . Unlocking do webmaster , recorder trace system component , hard copy hold sponsor CRO site .</detailed_description>
