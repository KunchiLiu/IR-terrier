	<brief_summary>Alcohol dependence , `` alcoholism '' , affect approximately 14 million Americans . Currently , three pharmacotherapies ( disulfiram , naltrexone , acamprosate ) approve treatment alcohol dependence medication , best , moderately successful . Thus , great need examination biological system , contribute/influence drug reward/addiction pathway within brain , discovery new target new pharmacotherapies possible . Other biological system addition dopamine , serotonin , norepinephrine ( NE ) think important several aspect addiction , include reward , crave depression . This study examine effect 5 day course atomoxetine ( selective NE transporter ( NET ) inhibitor ) ( 80 mg/day ; Strattera placebo ) alcohol-elicited crave sensitivity alcohol . The novelty study atomoxetine fact target NET , neither heretofore examine context alcohol dependence . It hopeful study , 64 total individual , provide PI sufficient preliminary data submit subsequent R01 application study atomoxetine involvement specific single nucleotide polymorphism within NET gene alcohol-related phenotype alcohol dependent non-dependent population . The long-term objective research develop efficacious treatment intervention alcohol abuse dependence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : NET genotype group rs11648486 SNP ( CC 61 % ; CT 33 % ; TT 4 % ) ( e.g. , C/C C/T ) compare one another 2 ( NET Genotype : C/C vs. C/T &amp; T/T ) x 2 ( Medication : atomoxetine 80 mg/day ( ~ vs. placebo ) x 3 ( Drink : Drink 1 , 2 , 3 ) mixed factorial repeat measure design use PROC MIXED SAS calculate difference score . Of interest possible interaction NET SNPs atomoxetine cue-elicited crave reward effect alcohol across trial .</detailed_description>
