	<detailed_description>Minimally invasive sling demonstrate similar efficacy earlier abdominal anti-incontinence procedure , offer benefit shorter operate time , less void dysfunction , low morbidity usually do outpatient procedure . Despite advantage , 35 % patient discharge home indwelling catheter . Indwelling catheter bothersome patient , costly healthcare system source significant morbidity . The challenge pelvic surgeon perform anti-incontinence procedure avoid postoperative urinary retention minimize use catheter associated risk . A commonly describe backfill-assisted void trial use mean evaluate bladder function postoperatively . This method use low post-void residual specific criterion discharge without catheter . However , validity method never critically evaluate . Our recent observational study suggest patient may safely discharge without catheter midurethral sling procedure base subjective assessment force stream . Our propose study expand pilot data use randomized trial evaluate two method post-operative void evaluation . The result may lead decrease use indwell catheter associate morbidity outpatient sling surgery .</detailed_description>
