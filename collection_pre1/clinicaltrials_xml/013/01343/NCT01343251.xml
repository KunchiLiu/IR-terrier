	<brief_summary>The main objective research study compare follow outcome patient Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow ( HeRO ) Graft patient cuff catheter dialysis access one year : quality life incidence bacteremia , vascular intervention , hospitalization , death .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HeRO Graft Compared Permanent Catheters End Stage Renal Disease ( ESRD ) Patients Receiving Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All eligible participant provide informed consent include study . Participants refuse HeRO Graft implantation , HeRO Graft implant reason , follow control group . Several patient receive HeRO graft due anatomical challenge failure complete step two-stage implant procedure . All consent participant implanted HeRO Graft follow study group . All participant follow study end , withdrawal , loss follow-up , death . The analysis include HeRO Graft patient control patient lose follow-up ; patient lose follow-up , data collection , exclude analysis . After obtain Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval , baseline demographic clinical data collect . Following surgery , implant procedure data collect study participant receive HeRO Grafts . HeRO Grafts place use 2-step process initial placement ePTFE portion , follow completion graft placement venous outflow component . Following enrollment , outcomes interest collect follow-up visit schedule weekly 4 week , bi-weekly 3 month , monthly 1 year , total 18 follow-up visit . Study coordinator document post-operative complication , incidence thrombosis , hospitalization , infection incident , death follow-up . Quality life data also collect participant use RAND Corporation 's Short Form ( 36 ) ( SF-36 ) Health Survey . This survey complete enrollment 3 month , 6 month , 12 month .</detailed_description>
