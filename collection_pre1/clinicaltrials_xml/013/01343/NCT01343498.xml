	<brief_summary>This dose escalation trial evaluate twice daily dose sachet formulation BEZ235 . This trial find maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) sachet formulation give twice daily , well evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) twice daily dose . Patients initially give daily dose determine PK PD single daily dose . On Day 9 , begin twice daily dosing , half single daily dose divide twice daily , PK PD twice daily dose determine .</brief_summary>

If tissue available , patient still eligible enrollment study . 12 . Ability understand nature trial give write informed consent . 1 . Patients currently receive cancer therapy ( i.e. , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy [ exception LHRH agonists prostate cancer ] , surgery and/or tumor embolization ) . 2 . Use investigational drug within 21 day 5 halflives ( whichever short ) prior first dose BEZ235 . For investigational drug 5 halflives less 21 day , minimum 10 day termination investigational drug administration BEZ235 require . In addition , drugrelated toxicity recover grade 1 less . 3 . Any major surgery , radiotherapy , immunotherapy within last 28 day ( limited palliative radiation allow ≥ 2 week ) . Chemotherapy regimens delay toxicity within last 4 week ( within last 6 week prior nitrosourea mitomycin C ) . Chemotherapy regimens give continuously weekly basis limit potential delayed toxicity within last 2 week . 4 .

Concurrent condition investigator 's opinion would jeopardize compliance protocol . 22 . Inability unwillingness comply study and/or followup procedure outline protocol . 23 . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeeding adult reproductive potential employ effective method birth control . Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) six month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL ] surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective contraception study 5 T1/2 ( 8 day ) stop treatment . The highly effective contraception define either : 1 . True abstinence : When line prefer usual lifestyle subject . Periodic abstinence ( e.g . calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . 2 . Sterilization : surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago .
