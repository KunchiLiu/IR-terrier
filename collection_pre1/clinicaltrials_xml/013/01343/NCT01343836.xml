	<brief_title>Autologous Tenocyte Implantation Patients With Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overuse injury Achilles tendon common entity . When exact origin tendon pain unclear , term tendinopathy prefer . Most accepted treatment moment eccentric exercise programme , accord Dutch guideline . However , recent systematic review effectiveness eccentric exercise treat low extremity tendinoses conclude unclear whether eccentric exercise effective form treatment . Recent study describe new treatment strategy tendinopathies , use autologous Tenocyte Implantation ( ATI ) . This treatment option participate actively tissue repair process cell level . The published clinical pilot study tendon research report 60 % improvement score 6 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
