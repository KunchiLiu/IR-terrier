	<detailed_description>Chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) affect 5-10 % U.S. adult annually disproportionately impact individual minority low income background due disparity access treatment . Our previous Yoga Dosing Study 95 adult chronic low back pain recruit Boston Medical Center affiliate community health center show per week twice per week yoga class 12 week similarly effective reduce pain improve back relate function . We conclude due superior convenience low cost per week compare twice per week class , per week yoga protocol optimal current study . Evidence multiple study support moderate benefit CLBP exercise therapy individually-delivered physical therapist . Moreover , physical therapy common , reimbursed , non-pharmacologic treatment recommend physician CLBP . However , study date do head-to-head comparison effectiveness yoga physical therapy CLBP . To ultimately reduce disparity CLBP minority population , patient , provider , health insurer need know complementary therapy yoga compare effectiveness well establish treatment physical therapy ( PT ) education . If yoga superior education similar effectiveness PT cost less great adherence , potential therapeutic economic implication would substantial . Alternatively , yoga inferior , information help guide good treatment decision reduce unnecessary expenditure inferior treatment . The present study ( Back Health ) 52 week comparative effectiveness randomize controlled trial per week yoga class , individually deliver physical therapy ( PT ) , education chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) 320 individual predominantly minority background recruit Boston Medical Center affiliate community health center . The 52 week trial start initial 12 week Treatment Phase follow 40 week Maintenance Phase . Back Health follow three specific aim : 1 . In 12 week Treatment Phase , enroll 320 adult chronic low back pain ( CLBP ) predominately low-income minority community compare effectiveness ( co-primary endpoint pain function ) ( 1 ) standardize protocol one yoga class per week ; ( 2 ) standardize exercise therapy protocol base evidence-based clinical guideline individually deliver physical therapist ; ( 3 ) educational book self-care CLBP 2 . For adult CLBP complete initial 12 week yoga physical therapy ( PT ) Treatment Phases , compare effectiveness ( co-primary endpoint pain function ) patient participate structured yoga maintenance program , structure PT maintenance program , structured maintenance program . 3 . Determine cost-effectiveness yoga , PT , education adult CLBP 12 week , 6 month , 9 month , one year three perspective : society , third party payer , participant . For 12 week Treatment Phase , participant randomize 2:2:1 ratio ( 1 ) standardize per week hatha yoga class supplement home practice ; ( 2 ) standardize evidence-based exercise therapy protocol individually deliver physical therapist supplement home practice ; ( 3 ) education deliver self-care book . The study co-primary endpoint mean pain intensity previous week measure 11 point numerical rating scale back-specific function measure use 23 point modify Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire . We hypothesize : ( 1 ) yoga noninferior physical therapy ; ( 2 ) yoga physical therapy superior education . For 40 week Maintenance Phase , yoga participant re-randomized 1:1 ratio either structure ongoing maintenance yoga program maintenance yoga program . Similarly , physical therapy participant re-randomized 1:1 ratio either structure ongoing maintenance PT program maintenance PT program . Education participant encourage continue review follow recommendation educational material . We hypothesize : ( 1 ) maintenance yoga non-inferior maintenance PT ; ( 2 ) maintenance yoga maintenance PT superior yoga maintenance PT maintenance , respectively ; ( 3 ) maintenance yoga maintenance PT superior education . We also take advantage comprehensive integrate set patient database , self-report cost data , study record compare 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , one year cost-effectiveness yoga , physical therapy , education three perspective : society , third-party payer , participant . Qualitative data interview focus group add subjective detail complement quantitative data . Results Back Health Study help determine whether justifiable yoga , currently `` complementary '' therapy , become acceptable `` mainstream '' treatment chronic low back pain .</detailed_description>
