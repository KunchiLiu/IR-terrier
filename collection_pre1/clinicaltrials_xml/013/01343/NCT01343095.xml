	<brief_summary>This study seek examine effect overnight noise reduction critically ill patient receive mechanical ventilation . The investigator randomly place subject one three group : 1 ) usual care 2 ) overnight earplug 3 ) overnight earplugs noise-canceling headphone . The investigator monitor safety , measure amount delirium experienced subject , record amount sedate painkilling medicine require , measure sleep quality study , among information . The investigator also measure noise level experience patient group . The investigator predict use overnight noise reduction safe reduce amount delirium improve quality sleep critically ill patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Delirium acute confusional state define fluctuate mental status , inattention , either disorganize thinking alter level consciousness . Acute delirium increasingly recognize problem intensive care unit ( ICUs ) US worldwide . ICU Delirium estimate occur many 50 80 percent ICU patient . Delirium ICU associate worsened clinical outcome prolonged hospitalization death [ 1-4 ] . Although noise show negatively influence sleep ICU , sleep disturbance recognize contributor ICU delirium [ 1-2 , 4 ] , well-established link ICU noise level development ICU delirium . Optimal strategy prevention treatment ICU delirium yet define , study focus novel noise-reduction approach potential impact prevention treatment [ 5-8 ] . Findings generalizable tertiary care medical intensive care unit care adult patient . Objectives Our multidisciplinary team evaluate safety feasibility direct noise reduction Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center ( WFUBMC ) Medical Intensive Care Unit ( MICU ) , effect incidence ICU delirium . Methods Measures Design - Forty-five ( 45 ) patient receive mechanical ventilation randomize receive either passive direct noise reduction ( earplug ) , passive active direct noise reduction ( earplugs noise-canceling headphone ) , direct noise reduction ( usual practice ) . - Ambient noise level reduction noise accomplish direct noise reduction measure accord standardize audiometric technique . - Sleep structure , include amount recovery sleep , measure one night accord standardize polysomnographic ( sleep study ) techniques - The incidence delirium assess well multiple endpoint include limited amount psychoactive medication prescribe amount physical restraint require .</detailed_description>
