	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) autosomal recessive genetic disease , characterize pulmonary sinus disease , gastrointestinal reproductive tract dysfunction . CF patient suffer chronic repeat cycle pulmonary bacterial infection , pulmonary exacerbation chronic lung function decline , often lead premature death . Although improved treatment lung disease increase survival , median predict age survival 37.2 year United States ( US ) ( CFF Annual Data Report , 2008 ) patient continue significant morbidity , include hospitalization ( Ramsey , 1996 ) . Pulmonary Function Tests ( PFTs ) use measure track lung health patient CF . Performing PFT take practice require patient perform certain breathe maneuver consistently . Infants young child test use spirometer . The investigator start PFT training patient reach 4 year age . It may take several month year useful , consistent interpretable PFTs obtain . According standard develop American Thoracic Society , child must able breathe deeply , exhale fast hard , continue exhale several second . Children also must perform maneuver repeatable manner . ( Ferris , 1978 ) . Recent software program develop encourage assist child complete breathe maneuver . Videogame-like graphic respond child 's effort . Children often choose `` game '' play , , `` Blow candle . '' PFT result take great importance new therapy test evaluate . One component PFT FEV1 value ( amount air exhale one second ) . Physicians , family patient keep track FEV1 value decrease investigate carefully addressed treatment modification , necessary . Many industry-sponsored CF Foundation-sponsored protocol use FEV1 value exclusion inclusion criterion study involve patient CF . FEV1 use judge efficacy investigational treatment . ( In many study , change FEV1 primary endpoint measure . ) Almost patient CF participate national CF Foundation ( CFF ) -sponsored CF Registry . Detailed clinical information collect Registry publish year CFF Annual Data Report online , information accessible public . The Data Report mean one way compare outcomes different CF Centers . Also , use locally identify area need improvement . In recently publish 2008 Data Report , average FEV1 value patient Center age 6-12 year decrease significantly last year . This continue trend investigator see past 5 year , despite apparent change treatment protocol Center . Nationally , FEV1 value patient age range stay . This apparent local decrease quite troubling Center staff become recent focus Quality Improvement effort . Our Upstate CF Care Center active research . For example , 2009 , 68 135 pediatric patient participate 16 clinical trial . Sponsors often provide study site spirometer use PFTs . These machine mean provide uniform PFTs result study , include measurement FEV1 value . In 2009 , among 52 patient Center 6-12 year old , 20 ( 38 % ) study sponsor-provided spirometer . Among 32 patient ages 13-17 year , 13 ( 40 % ) study sponsor-provided spirometer . Anecdotally , investigator note FEV1 result obtain clinical trial patient appear low patient ' usual value , especially young child . The investigator hypothesize apparent difference PFT result might relate different incentive ( ) provide study PFT equipment .
