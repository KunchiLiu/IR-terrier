	<brief_summary>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( bleed brain due rupture aneurysm ) serious condition high morbidity ( incidence ill health ) mortality ( death ) . There approximately 11 case per 100,000 population per year , approximately 40 % case fatal . ( Ingall ) Among fortunate subject survive initial bleed , vasospasm subsequent stroke major cause morbidity . Vasospasm define prolong severe , although reversible cause arterial narrowing occur bleed subarachnoid space , commonly aneurysmal rupture . ( Youman ) The reduce arterial diameter inhibits blood flow deprive brain oxygen , often result stroke . Vasospasm major problem treat subject aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . For reason , essential diagnose cerebral vasospasm early , permanent deficit develop . There may another option solve dilemma . The field neuro-monitoring ( neurological monitoring ) technology available continuously monitor brain activity sedate ICU subject . This may allow early diagnosis possibly identify change neurologic function become symptomatic . In past , neuro-monitoring primarily use operating room monitor neurologic function surgery around spinal cord . Surgery spine spinal cord also carry form risk , either mechanical trauma spinal cord nerve root , interruption blood supply structure . Should damage nerve fiber occur , end result could paralysis , loss sensation , onset severe burning ( i.e . neuropathic ) pain . The field intraoperative neuro-monitoring ( IOM ) develop address risk spine surgery , whereby nerve rostral ( toward head ) caudal ( toward foot ) site surgery stimulate ( usually via electrical pulse ) signal record side opposite site stimulation . Thus , signal carry nerve fiber force pass region risk surgery . In event change nerve response see , surgical team notify , change 're try restore signal , thereby preserve function nerve fiber . This technology use neurosurgical ICU monitor subject severe brain injury trauma , stroke , intracranial hemorrhage subarachnoid hemorrhage . Using continuous electroencephalogram ( EEG ) monitoring combine somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEPs ) ( type neuro monitor ) use determine prognosis , identify subject subclinical status epilepticus ( state brain constant seizure ) , predict elevation intracranial pressure Increased pressure within skull ) , diagnose cerebral hypoxia ( enough oxygen brain ) ( Amantini )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage serious condition high morbidity mortality . There approximately 11 case per 100,000 population per year , approximately 40 % case fatal . ( Ingall ) Among fortunate subject survive initial bleed , vasospasm subsequent stroke major cause morbidity . Vasospasm define prolong severe , although reversible cause arterial narrowing occur bleed subarachnoid space , commonly aneurismal rupture . ( Youman ) The reduce arterial diameter inhibits blood flow deprive brain oxygen , often result stroke . Vasospasm major problem treat subject aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Up 75 % subject aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage develop vasospasm , 30 % subarachnoid hemorrhage subject become clinically symptomatic , muscle weakness primary symptom . ( Dorsch ) Even intervention , 12 % patent symptomatic vasospasm develop permanent clinical deficit ( rupture aneurysm ) include hemiplegia , aphasia , visual loss . Less severe stroke may lead modest loss strength sensation one side body , and/or deterioration high brain function , memory , speech comprehension , plan . Continuous Neuro-monitoring previously use trauma ICU setting mean detect deterioration brain function close head injury ( Amantini , Daubin ) , ischemic encephalopathy ( Hakimi ) subject MCA stroke determine function ( Tzvetanov ) . It also observe monitoring change occur prior ICP elevation critically ill subject ( Amantini ) . These study demonstrate feasibility well safety monitoring ICU . No study date attempt monitoring vasospasm subject suffer aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage . Motor evoke potential also trialed ICU , although MEP may useful determine cerebral ischemia , well functional outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All adult subject subarachnoid hemorrhage rupture aneurysm require high level sedation , poor neurologic exam mechanical ventilation eligible study . Hunt Hess Grade 4 5 ( bad grade ; high mortality ; high level dependence survive ) subarachnoid hemorrhage subject definition severely depressed exam , require intubation mechanical ventilation . Those subject whose respiratory status deteriorate necessitate intubation high level sedation also qualify . All subject subarachnoid hemorrhage undetermined source , angiogram negative subarachnoid hemorrhage , reliable neurological exam Hunt Hess grade 13 subarachnoid hemorrhage subject , intubate , require minimal sedation therefore consistent neurological exam exclude study . Also , subject body temperature le 32 degree Celsius exclude .</criteria>
