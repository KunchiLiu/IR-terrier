	<brief_summary>This study aim examine use external trigeminal nerve stimulation ( TNS ) adjunctive treatment adult major depressive disorder ( MDD ) add onto antidepressant medication . Our primary objective examination two different `` dos '' TNS , term pulse frequency . To accomplish specific aim , investigator test follow specific hypothesis : 1 . Subjects show great improvement rating mood symptom depression six-week high frequency stimulation low frequency stimulation period . 2 . Subjects show great improvement 12 week high frequency stimulation six week high frequency stimulation . 3 . Subjects show improvement rating life functional capacity quality life TNS . 4 . Subjects report TNS treatments acceptable term side effect burden use device . 5 . Subjects show significant difference regional brain function end high frequency stimulation period compare baseline , significant difference high low frequency stimulation condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 20 subject Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) , age 18 65 , consent join project UCLA . The project two phase : 12 week treatment phase 6 month follow-up phase . In first phase , double-blind one-way cross-over design allow u compare clinical physiologic response TNS two frequency stimulation , `` high '' ( ~120 Hz ) `` low `` ( ~20 Hz ) . Subjects randomized start six week period either high low frequency stimulation ( n=10 ) ; subject staff interact blind assignment , separate member team program device setting . At six week point , low frequency group subject cross high frequency , high frequency group continue high frequency . At end 12 week , TNS system return adjunctive treatment end . All subject follow another six month monthly telephone call monitor symptom change treatment would signal return symptom . The primary endpoint change depression severity two group week 6 visit .</detailed_description>
