	<brief_summary>This year-long investigator-initiated study design determine effect MK-0677 , GH secretagogue , renal patient . It double-blind , placebo-controlled trial employ follow procedure : Informed consent process , follow evaluation screening test confirm patient ' eligibility . Patients whose screen laboratory result glycated hemoglobin level , thyroid function , liver function exceed protocol eligibility criterion randomize . Other exclusion Congestive Heart Failure Class III IV New York Heart Assocation 's ( NYHA ) Guidelines specify cardiovascular disorder within six month baseline visit muscle weakness associate neuromuscular neurological disorder . Before subject begin take experimental drug MK-0677 placebo , baseline assessment subject ' hormone cytokine level , physical condition , body mass ( determine DEXA scan ) , strength functionality , appetite obtain . In addition , quality life assessment ( SF-36 ) administer . This study 's primary outcome increase lean body weight . Secondary outcome cytokine hormone level , include , leptin , insulin , ghrelin , TNF- alpha , CRPs , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-10 , ghrelin associate esterase adiponectin , nutritional status , quality life ( QoL ) , food appreciation , physical function economic impact . 70 subject enrollment target . This number determine offset project screen failure early withdrawal rate , ensure 42 subject complete study .</brief_summary>

GFR MDRD estimate ≤ 30 ml/minute/ 1.73m2 two consecutive determination ( one GFR result screen visit lab another GFR result prior laboratory determination and/or unscheduled visit confirm GFR truly within correct range . ) Prior use experimental drug , MK0677 Subject diagnose neuromuscular neurological disease cause muscle weakness . Body mass index great 35 kg/m2 , morbid obesity Uncontrolled hypothyroidism , define elevate serum thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) free serum thyroxine ( T4 ) less low limit normal , test screening ( Patients require thyroid replacement study may continue . ) Uncontrolled hyperthyroidism , define TSH less low limit normal elevate free T4 , test screen Hemoglobin &lt; 10 Gm/dl screening Elevated serum transaminase ( alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) . ( ≥2.0 time upper limit normal screening ) Elevated alkaline phosphatase ( Alk Phos ) . ( ≥3.0 time upper limit normal screening ) Diabetes one following : 1 . Poorly control diabetes define HbA1C &gt; 7.0 % screen 2 . Preproliferative Proliferative diabetic retinopathy [ To participate study , diabetic patient need dilate ophthalmology exam retinal photography within 12 month enrollment . Individuals already extensive background retinopathy need dilate ophthalmology exam within 3 month enrollment . Patients preproliferative proliferative retinopathy exclude . ] 3 . Unwilling unable check blood glucose home least daily Currently receive systemic corticosteroid dose ≥10 mg prednisone . ( The previous use , current use , topical inhale corticosteroid allow . ) Currently take previously anabolic steroid growth hormone dose , duration , 12 month prior study entry . Significant endorgan disease , kidney disease , , opinion investigator may pose added risk patient , confound study result , impair patient 's ability complete trial . Any following disorder within 6 month prior baseline : 1 . Acute coronary syndrome ( e.g. , myocardial infarction unstable angina ) 2 . Coronary artery intervention ( e.g. , coronary bypass graft [ CABG ] , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty [ PTCA ] ) 3 . Stroke transient ischemic neurological disorder ( e.g . transient ischemic attack [ TIA ] ) New worsen sign symptom coronary heart disease within 3 month prior baseline NYHA ( New York Heart Association ) Class III IV congestive heart failure ( definition show Appendix A ) Uncontrolled hypertension check screening visit : evidence &gt; 160 systolic and/or 100 diastolic ( measure dominant arm , least 5 minute , sit ) Cancer , diagnosis malignancy within last 5 year , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , adequately treat situ cervical cancer Active carpal tunnel syndrome Patient , opinion investigator , mentally legally incapacitate informed consent obtain adherence study procedure dose regimen questionable Patient , study entry , regular user ( include `` recreational use '' ) illicit drug recent history ( within last 5 year ) drug alcohol abuse .
