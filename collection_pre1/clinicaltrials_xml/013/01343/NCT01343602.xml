Blinded external assessor evaluate patient use standardized outcome measure intervention , six month later . The two coprimary endpoint assessment arm hand function prerequisites participation ( define equal involvement activity daily live ) quality arm hand use arm hand function . Assessments make four week post-treatment relativized baseline performance . Changes primary outcome analyze mixed model , consider hierarchical structure data , adjust baseline measurement sex . The primary analysis compare two randomized group , respect adjust average two coprimary endpoint . To keep overall significance level 5 % , two endpoint test significance level 5 % hierarchical order .</detailed_description>
