	<brief_summary>Many drug user live HIV demonstrate inadequate level medication adherence , high risk disengage care . HIV positive drug user even high risk poor medication adherence treatment dropout live far treatment center . Rural residence common U.S. South rate new HIV infection disproportionately high , especially among ethnic minority . While efficacious intervention improve HIV treatment adherence , target drug user , require patient come research clinic adherence intervention . Transportation problem , poverty , isolation , stigma know barrier access adherence support among rural drug user HIV.Additionally , adherence intervention aim increase adherence , come late , unable respond real time adherence lapse help patient re-initiate appropriate medication use remain natural environment . There press need develop tailor , scalable intervention detect nonadherence episode real time enhance adherence HIV treatment immediately . Building intervention upon familiar , exist technology could extend reach community non-urban patient live HIV , overcome common barrier care , could ultimately scale help drug use HIV+ patient nationwide . The investigator propose develop test feasibility promise combine HIV adherence assessment intervention application rural drug user use available , familiar technology whose reach grow exponentially : text messaging via mobile phone . By 2007 , 84 % U.S. resident mobile phone , near 100 % mobile phone penetration project 2013 . While technology adoption often slow under-served community , trend different mobile phone technology . African-Americans use mobile phone minute per caput increase use high rate compare ethnic group . This technology great potential reduce health disparity . In project , investigator develop test feasibility promise text message application system use Ecological Momentary Assessment method detect nonadherence drug use immediately intervene improve HIV treatment adherence drug user live HIV/AIDS reside outside major metropolitan area . This R34 Stage 1b/2a project Stage Model Behavioral Therapy Development develop novel intervention method , generate preliminary estimate effect size determine whether large clinical trial extend follow-up cost-effectiveness evaluation warrant . The specific aim project : 1 . To identify assessment intervention feature relevant adherence barrier drug use pattern rural non-urban HIV+ drug user use formative method include : - structure interview focus group identify specific barrier adherence engagement care need related drug crave drug use address intervention - iterative usability test component drafts intervention 2 . To create text message mobile phone application system ( Treatment Extension Texting , Text ) ass improve HIV treatment adherence drug use real time -- Text build upon piloted unidirectional personalize text phone application system , STeM , include pre- post-programming usability test 3 . To test feasibility promise assessment intervention tool randomize pilot trial rural HIV+ drug user detectable viral load ( VL ) compare Text usual care - Feasibility : Identify recruitment rate , consent rate , participant flow , completion rate , variance key covariates outcome variable - Promise : determine point estimate precision effect primary secondary adherence outcome include pharmacy refill unannounced pill count ( medication adherence ) , miss visit percentage ( treatment engagement ) , VL , drug crave drug use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Text Messaging Intervention Improve HIV Adherence Rural Drug Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Active illicit drug use , regardless diagnostic category ( i.e. , abuse dependence ) , along medication non-adherence , problematic behavior target change study . The investigator develop test innovative mobile-phone deliver text message intervention design reduce drug use increase HIV medication adherence . In first phase work ( quarter 1-2 ) , investigator use qualitative , formative method user input develop assessment intervention content , technology partner develop mobile phone application shell investigator conduct initial pre-coding usability test . Focus group use inform final design text message application , participant input provide important information help u determine number rate message . The investigator plan recruit 1-2 focus group three participate clinic spend day two day location conduct group conduct individual interview participant prefer private interview . In past , investigator succeed recruit group 5-8 participant use flyer , word mouth , reminder provider prompt participant call study staff arrange participation . The investigator also typically schedule group several week ' notice , daytime evening hour , accommodate schedule employ unemployed participant . The investigator plan provide lunch snack , compensate participant time . The purpose focus group individual interview develop content phone application , address adherence barrier drug use pattern , investigator program message ( query ) appropriate population . Other topic cover focus group individual interview include preferred rate messaging , type message desire , use language term participant understand random schedule query , follow iterative user test pre-programming shell program determine whether understand flow , understand term symbol , etc . The investigator gather quantitative ( count ) data well qualitative ( free response ) data , investigator analyze rate theme , respectively . Themes derive analysis transcript interview focus group session , group related category determine common unusual concern participant . The investigator ensure program address common issue , investigator decide case case basis whether incorporate unusual issue . However , unusual issue may important one , represent likely crisis intervention topic plan . The count data provide raw number anchor thematic data . Given people text may send receive 50 message per day routinely , seem overly burdensome request respond system 5 time per day , issue address directly focus group . This formative work use generate appropriate content structure intervention best fit need unique rural , HIV+ , drug use population . The revision exist text message tool , Stem , take approximately 6 month , proceed iteratively . The investigator iteratively test acceptability usability component tool target population finalize program conduct guided session participant review program via screenshots . The result product novel mobile phone application , Text , investigator test user phone home 2 week period quarter 2 identify remain program need finalize system pilot trial . There three distinct type message event plan Random query send rate 4 per day normal waking hour participant , recommend leading Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) researcher . The second type medication dose reminder , patient occur twice per day current ART medication regimen . The third type event-contingent message , PARTICIPANT initiate , event like drug craving , drug use , etc . Therefore , participant receive 5 maybe 6 message per day system , may send 1-2 message confirm take medication , may send u message report critical event . The current Stem system program web-based application . A staff member interview participant determine kind message want sent emphasis personal meaning concern confidentiality . The staff member type message web-based program patient present . The investigator archive previously use personal message new participant could review reuse create message . For enhanced TEXT application propose , investigator use procedure develop message . Staff member also assist participant program cell phone appropriate number review relevant feature . Therefore , staff member programming , participant 's guidance message helpful . When literacy issue , investigator use combination simple textable icon along word assist participant understanding message . The finalized intervention compare usual care small pilot randomize trial demonstrate feasibility approach , yield evidence promise ( estimate effect size ) recommend recent publication conduct pilot work . In phase , investigator test new Text intervention field real participant assess baseline , randomize receive phone Text intervention usual care 12 week period ( quarter 3-6 ) . The investigator assess participant 3 6 month post-treatment follow-up , complete data cleaning , analysis , report final month project ( quarter 5-8 ) . The investigator plan begin enrollment participant pilot trial quarter 3 , enrol 8-12 participant per month investigator enrol 70 people , occur quarter 5 6 . This permit 6 month follow-up participant . Hypotheses : Based rate change investigator saw two pilot study , investigator expect : 1 ) .The intervention result 20 % decrease Missed Visit Proportion ( MVP ) compare usual care . 2 ) .The intervention result 20 % increase adherence pharmacy refill data compare usual care . 3 ) .The intervention result 25 % decrease drug use 30 day compare usual care . Lastly , formal hypothesis , investigator expect intervention feasible acceptable participant , investigator measure use exit interview .</detailed_description>
