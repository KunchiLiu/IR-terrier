	<detailed_description>Glaucoma mostly disease old people highly accompany cataract.Some patient may need perform cataract surgery course glaucoma . But glaucoma patient , effect cataract surgery and/or type implant intraocular lens ( IOL ) result specific visual field test , like SWAP , still well studied.From past decade , various yellow-tinted IOLs speculation protect retinal photoreceptors decrease incidence age-related macular degeneration introduced.These blue-light-filtering IOLs contain yellow chromophore filter ultra violet ( UV ) large part high-energetic visible blue-light 380 500 nm . Based previous study yellow-tinted IOLs decrease amount light transmission retina may theoretically affect perimetry result . This might even important patient glaucoma sensitivity test location decrease per se . Since early diagnosis glaucoma progression highly dependent visual field result , important evaluate effect IOLs perimetry , particularly SWAP , blue-light-filtering IOLs might interfere finding .</detailed_description>
