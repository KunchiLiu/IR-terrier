	<brief_summary>This research do help u learn best use new drug may active acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Two study drug test : 5AC ( 5-azacitidine ) entinostat . 5AC improves blood count 50 - 60 % patient MDS also show promise AML . Entinostat undergone early testing patient MDS AML . It decrease blast count patient ' blood bone marrow improve blood count patient . The combination two class drug well tolerate appear work well together laboratory test . A recent study Johns Hopkins University administer 5AC entinostat overlap schedule patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMMoL ) , AML . The impressive result study lead another phase II trial examine drug combination versus 5AC alone patient . In study , want see time 5AC entinostat give affect magnitude disease response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Evaluate Two Schedules MS275 Combination With 5AC Elderly Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . To estimate major response rate ( complete partial response International Working Group ( IWG ) response criterion ) patient AML &gt; = 60 year old unable tolerate decline cytotoxic chemotherapy patient relapse despite one prior regimen treat ( ) 5AC 50mg/m2 subcutaneously/intravenously 10 day day 1 - 10 28 day cycle give combination entinostat 8 mg ( flat dose ) administer orally day 3 and10 cycle ( b ) regimen 5AC entinostat give day 10 17 . 2 . To estimate overall response rate ( complete , partial , hematologic improvement- major IWG criterion ) follow treatment two different dose schedule 5-Azacytidine entinostat patient AML &gt; = 60 year old unable tolerate decline cytotoxic chemotherapy relapse despite one prior regimen . The secondary objective study : 1 . To identify change gene promoter methylation gene expression response combination therapy 5AC entinostat compare dynamic kinetics alteration promoter methylation gene re-expression two different dose schedule . 2 . To evaluate effect entinostat induction hyperacetylation histone peripheral blood and/or bone marrow sample . 3 . To evaluate change DNA damage response combination therapy use gammaH2AX determination western blotting . 4 . To evaluate immune parameter exposure 5AC entinostat give either dose schedule evaluate relation clinical outcome . 5 . To evaluate duration response .</detailed_description>
