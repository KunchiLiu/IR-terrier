	<brief_summary>There rise incidence incidentally detect small renal tumour due improve image technique . Traditionally , patient diagnose small renal mass undergo surgery therefore limit data natural history tumour . Several small series report small mass grow slowly might require early intervention mass grow rapidly require immediate surgery . Presently , investigator able identify prospectively mass go grow slowly . The investigator plan use compute tomography ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) parameter , microsatellite analysis tissue analysis determine mass behave aggressively . Additionally , observation natural history small renal mass need validate multicentric systematically follow cohort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis Since renal cell carcinoma ( RCC 's ) detect image small renal mass , grow slowly remain asymptomatic year , hypothesize : - Small RCC 's destined metastasize early reach large size - Delayed surgical treatment asymptomatic , incidentally detect , small RCC 's WILL NOT significant impact overall survival - The majority small RCC 's MAY NOT need treat . - RCC 's destined progress identify abnormal perfusion pattern image cellular genomic characteristic needle biopsy .</detailed_description>
