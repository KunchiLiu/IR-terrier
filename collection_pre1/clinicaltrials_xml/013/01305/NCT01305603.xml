	<brief_summary>Using Magnetic resonance ( MR ) scan ultrasonography investigator wish investigate , way know volume local anesthetic injectate distribute transverse abdominis plane ( TAP ) young healthy male volunteer . The investigator compare anatomical distribution local anesthetic injectate TAP perform ultrasound-guided classical TAP block Dual TAP block . The investigator also want compare spread anesthetize frontal dermatome perform ultrasound-guided classical TAP block Dual TAP block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ultrasound-guided Dual TAP Block : Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) Evaluation Distribution Local Anesthetic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There much debate extent classical TAP block anesthetize frontal dermatome ( TH10-Th12/L1 ) . Some cadaver study perform injection dye classical TAP . However , still clear whether single injection local anesthetic classical TAP block position reach cephalad medial intercostal TAP plexus ( Th6-Th9 ) . In study investigator use MR scan ultrasonography investigate way know volume local anesthetic injectate distribute transverse abdominis plane ( TAP ) young healthy male volunteer . The investigator compare anatomical distribution local anesthetic injectate TAP perform ultrasound-guided classical TAP block Dual TAP block . The investigator also want compare spread anesthetize frontal dermatome perform ultrasound-guided classical TAP block Dual TAP block .</detailed_description>
