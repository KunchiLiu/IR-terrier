	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well bevacizumab without fosbretabulin tromethamine work treat patient ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , peritoneal cavity cancer come back persistent . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , find tumor cell help kill . Bevacizumab fosbretabulin tromethamine may stop growth ovarian cancer block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether bevacizumab effective without fosbretabulin tromethamine treat ovarian epithelial , fallopian tube , peritoneal cavity cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Without Fosbretabulin Tromethamine Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Peritoneal Cavity Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival hazard ratio combination bevacizumab fosbretabulin tromethamine ( CA4P ) compare bevacizumab alone patient persistent recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine nature degree toxicity fosbretabulin tromethamine plus bevacizumab . II . To characterize compare progression-free survival patient measurable disease ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) patient detectable ( non-measurable ) disease regimen . III . To determine overall survival regimen . IV . To estimate proportion patient measurable disease objective tumor response treatment . V. To provide descriptive information cancer antigen ( CA ) -125 response regimen possible objective tumor response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute fosbretabulin tromethamine IV 10-20 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive bevacizumab Arm I . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
