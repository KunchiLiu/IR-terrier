	<criteria>The subject legally authorize representative demonstrates understand nature study voluntarily provide write informed consent prior data collection study procedure . The subject ≥ 21 year old , must either male nonpregnant female expect lifespan sufficient allow completion study procedure . A negative pregnancy test result ( urine blood ) require prior implant . If enrol female become pregnant prior study completion , participation study terminate . Based Investigator judgment , subject increase risk PE require vena caval interruption . Note : Subjects diagnose acute DVT and/or PE must objective confirmation base image evidence least one diagnosis . Patients without PE venous thromboembolic disease ( VTED ) risk PE may enrol trial . However , enrollment patient limit maximum 40 % total sample size . Based Investigator 's judgment , subject patent venous anatomy suitable femoral jugular/subclavian access filter placement ( e.g . excessive tortuosity ) . The IVC ≤ 28 mm diameter intend implantation site base radiographic image evidence . Based Investigator 's judgment , filter safely place position filter tip 1 cm low renal vein . Retrieval filter expect within 180 day post placement . At six month follow , Investigator determine filter continue clinically indicate , filter may leave place risk PE pass leave permanently . All patient filter retrieve six month continue follow 24 month one month post filter retrieval , whichever come first . The subject patent venous anatomy suitable jugular access retrieval filter base image evidence within 48 hour prior filter placement procedure . Imaging mode physician 's discretion . The subject willing comply protocol requirement specify followup evaluation . The subject previously implant filter IVC superior vena cava ( SVC ) . The subject duplicate leftsided IVC . The subject severe spinal deformity would impede access IVC filter placement filter retrieval procedure . The subject serum creatinine ≥ 2 mg/dl ( dialysis ) within seven day study enrollment . Patients dialysis allow participate trial . The subject know uncorrectable bleed diathesis active coagulopathy . The subject life expectancy &lt; 25 month . The subject know allergy sensitivity nickel titanium . The subject know allergy sensitivity iodinate contrast medium , adequately premedicated . NOTE : Alternative contrast agent permit purpose study . The subject currently participate investigational drug another device study .</criteria>
