	<brief_summary>Until assume regular endurance training positive influence cardiac function positive effect increase increase intensity . However , little known effect intense endurance stress heart . According current knowledge repeat exposure strenuous endurance activity may lead minor possibly irreversible damage heart resultant scar heart 's muscle . Within study investigator attempt find different analytical method - particular magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ultrasound heart - extent heart muscle affect long term intense endurance exercise change cardiac function morphology possibly find . Therefore investigator compare former national competitive endurance athlete sedentary control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Technique Assessment Exercise-induced Long- Short-Term Changes Cardiac Function Morphology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Despite well document cardio-protective effect aerobic exercise moderate intensity , short- long-term consequence strenuous exercise less clear . There increase evidence maintain high cardiac workload prolong duration may result transient impairment cardiac function . Recent study also report transient increase cardiac biomarkers prolong strenuous exercise . While patient cardiac disease presence cardiac dysfunction increase cardiac biomarkers generally reflect myocardial damage , impact observation athlete ill define . It matter concern whether athlete finding simply reflect reversible response whether repetitive event may lead accumulative cardiac damage . Traditional echocardiographic method use determine potential cardiac change morphology function investigator-dependent may subject interference cardiac pre- afterload . Cardiac magnetic resonance image provide investigator-independent objective method quantify cardiac dimension function . Delayed contrast enhancement MR image highly reproducible cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging technique directly visualize myocardial edema , necrosis fibrosis . Objective To use cardiac delay contrast enhancement magnetic resonance image combination echocardiographic method ass whether athlete involve prolonged strenuous exercise year reveal persistent alteration cardiac morphology function . Methods Cardiac delay contrast enhancement magnetic resonance imaging use combination echocardiographic method investigate whether involvement prolong strenuous exercise year lead change cardiac function morphology . Therefore study compare 15 veteran elite athletes 15 sedentary control . The use cardiac MRI delay contrast enhancement magnetic resonance image technique parallel echocardiographic tissue Doppler measurement allow comparative analysis two method .</detailed_description>
