	<brief_summary>The project run Ph.d. project Faculty Health Sciences- University Copenhagen . In Denmark investigator operate around 16.000 artificial hip knee yearly , mainly due osteoarthritis . The number increase 13,9 % hip 50,7 % knee period 2004 2007 . In 10 % case , approximately 1.600 patient , patient young 50 year - mid-life , work , socially active sexually active . The investigator tendency within orthopedic society mainly focus technological aspect procedure tend forget key event patient widespread consequence patient future life . Hip- knee arthroplasty without doubt two important successfully surgical procedure ever introduce . The economical cost osteoarthritis treatment explode develop world last decade , yearly growth 8 % . Because limited lifetime artificial hip knee , treatment unfortunate young patient . This last year lead increased interest joint preserve surgery . Over last twenty year try delay time total hip arthroplasty patient hip dysplasia aid Ganz osteotomy . Since technique introduce back 1988 , research topic main focus optimize operation technique . So surgery artificial hip knee investigator lack knowledge regard social , work relate , psychological sexual aspect treatment . Purpose The consequence artificial hip knee joint regard patient ' social-life , work , psychological sexual aspect gain little attention international . The investigator apply research fund exclusively research development surgical track procedure , new prosthesis designs coating . The investigator find study highly relevant kind study preform several chronic disease osteoarthritis treatment . With study investigator wish examine social , work relate , psychological sexual aspect end stage osteoarthritis . This lead way improved information patient improve surgeon ' possibility choose correct time surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Psychological , Sexually Social Consequences Osteoarthritis Treatment With THA TKA Joint Preserving Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Denmark approximately 16.000 artificial hip knee insert yearly . A increase number probably continue increase due demographic factor population rise demand active life old age . However 16.000 artificial joint approximately 10 % inserted patient fifty year ( 1 ; 2 ) . This group patient mid-life thereby part work socially- sexually active . Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) unquestionably one successfully operation introduce , capable relieve pain , optimize function joint optimize quality life ( 3 ; 4 ) . In resent year main focus optimize surgical track , whereby patient today admit hospital 1-2 day . This progress tremendous impact patient , department health care system . Joint replacement surgery THA TKA key event patient recreate patient 's mobility well widespread ( still undocumented ) consequence patient future life . In preoperative treatment plan correct time surgery , import know , patient affect disable joint disease like end-stage osteoarthritis ( OA ) consequences patient artificial joint . It known , patient OA two-fold increase risk depression ( 8-13 ) . These aspect treatment far desirable attention , neither national international At Hvidovre Hospital , Frederiksberg Hospital Køge Hospital Orthopaedic departments many year experience joint replacement surgery specialist level . The structure department base modern fast-track principal , clearly define goal preoperative information , pre- postoperative regime discharge criterion . Thereby insure smooth course , short rekonvalens minimize complication . Because limited lifetime artificial hip knee , treatment unfortunate young patient . This last year lead increased interest joint preserve surgery . Over last twenty year try delay time total hip arthroplasty patient hip dysplasia aid Peri Acetabular Osteotomy ( PAO ) . Hip dysplasia see equally sex . However often symptomatic female ( 14 ) . In Denmark PAO perform Copenhagen University Hospital , Odense University Hospital Aarhus University Hospital . The procedure preform symptomatic ( mainly sharp groin pain ) patient hope delay development OA . Femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI ) believe pathology , repeat trauma acetabular labrum adjacent chondral structure result labral tear chondral delamination , lead groin pain time OA . However minor study concern impact procedure young patient life term psychological , sexually social wellbeing . Patients include men woman twenty sixty year old admit undergo primary uni- bilateral THA TKA Hvidovre Hospital , Frederiksberg Hospital Køge Hospital result end-stage OA , rheumatoid arthritis another joint disease diagnose one department doctor specialty joint replacement surgery . The included patient PAO study PAO Aarhus University Hospital 1999-2002 age fifteen time surgery . To avoid co-morbidity confounders joint disease main disease . The goal study investigate : 1 . What Health-Related-Quality-Of-Life ( HRQoL ) consequences end-stage hip knee OA ? The investigator examine SF-36 , standardize validated questionnaire explore HRQOL . 2 . What relation pre- postoperative joint function patient HRQoL , relation reflect patient 's social class attachment workforce . 3 . Which preoperative parameter strong relation postoperative out-come ? The highly nuanced picture investigator get patient pre- postoperative condition enable u answer question . 4 . How patient 's relation workforce-affected patient 's joint disease operation ? Are investigator able operate patient back work ? Do patient lose 's job operation ? Do patient 's job preoperative keep job without job preoperative recover work ability operation ? 5 . It known patient OA two fold increase risk depression . Is depression due patient underlie disease ? Or depression due modulation pain perception lead lower pain threshold lead increase prevalence symptomatic OA ? If THA TKA curative patient 's depression , investigator may assume depression due patient disable disease vice versa . 6 . It known patient hip OA experience sexual-problems . How affected joint replacement surgery ? A Danish study show old men -average age 70 years- receives THA highly increase risk postoperative impotence -26 % compare expect 3 % age match group . Other study show female experience improvement sexual-life THA . Unfortunately , quite small study concern subject . The investigator wish explore subject similar subject TKA , previously explore . 7 . Over last three decade increase focus joint preserving surgery , mainly form PAO . This procedure preform public hospital Aarhus University Hospital , Odense University Hospital Copenhagen University Hospital . Aarhus University Hospital hold lead experience Denmark perform approximately 75 procedure year . However documentation procedure affect patient HRQoL sexual-life . The main part study run prospective questionnaire base study patient , THA TKA Hvidovre University Hospital , Frederiksberg University Hospital Køge Hospital . A small part study retrospective questionnaire base study patient , period 1999-2002 underwent PAO Aarhus University Prior plan surgery THA TKA patient receive questionnaire . This follow questionnaire 3 , 6 12 month postoperative . Twelve month postoperative patient ambulatory control . The patient underwent PAO Aarhus University Hospital period 1999-2002 post questionnaire . The inclusion patient start April 2010 run least summer 2011 least 250 patient include . The result expect published international English language journal research finding defend PhD ad Faculty Health Sciences- University Copenhagen . Purposes study : Primary purpose : To investigate end-stage OA joint replacement surgery affect patient HRQoL herby impact procedure young patient life term psychological , sexually social wellbeing . Next investigator wish investigate patient ' attachment workforce affect bye end-stage OA joint replacement surgery Secondary purpose : To investigate patient disable joint disease need joint replacement surgery affect describe . Tertiary purpose : Edification database reveal complication year well-defined young patient population , high demand prosthesis consequence put high stress . Other purpose : To investigate impact PAO young patient life term HRQoL , psychological , sexually social wellbeing .</detailed_description>
