	<brief_summary>Researchers actively seek way coat inside synthetic graft closely resemble native vessel therefore low thrombogenicity low incidence stenosis . Using biological coating comprise autologous stromal cell derive patient 's adipose tissue logical solution . Considerable experimental evidence exists coat relatively non-thrombogenic improves long-term graft patency . The Company 's TGI Cell Isolation System ( CIS ) isolate concentrate adipose-derived stromal cell ( ASC ) use fill press medical need small-diameter synthetic vascular graft . The TGI CIS enable user prepare stem cell-based biological coating adipose tissue liposuctioned patient . The cell derive adipose tissue sod onto internal lumen vascular graft improve long term patency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Replacement bypass small diameter ( &lt; 4-5 mm ) blood vessel need variety medical problem , include peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) associate diabetes , generalize atherosclerosis , age ) , critical limb ischemia ( CLI ) . Vascular surgery extremely successful replace damage atherosclerotic artery large diameter associate high flow rate . However , diameter damage vessel decrease , ability achieve long-term patency use replacement vessel decrease . The best current solution phenomenon decrease patency decrease vessel diameter use saphenous vein bypass graft . The saphenous vein become benchmark small diameter vascular graft demonstrate excellent patency use femoral artery popliteal artery knee . However , extend distal location include tibial artery , even saphenous vein begin demonstrate limitation ability maintain long-term patency . The TGI ASC-coated expand polytetrafluoroethylene ( ePTFE ) Vascular Graft adipose-derived stromal cell-sodded small-diameter vascular conduit intend use peripheral bypass graft . The autologous cell use create ASC-coated vascular graft isolate TGI Cell Isolation System ( CIS ) . The TGI ASC-coated graft use address press medical need small-diameter vascular graft improve long-term patency rate . The TGI CIS enable user prepare stem cell-based biological coat hour ; stromal cell isolate adipose tissue sod onto internal lumen vascular graft implant patient course peripheral vascular bypass procedure . The TGI Peripheral Vascular Graft ( PVG ) Kit consist vascular conduit , proprietary enzymatic solution ( Adipase™ Custom Enzyme Solution ) , disposable fluidics system , use conjunction TGI CIS , automate point-of-care tissue processing instrument isolate ASCs lipoaspirate specimen . Such cell administer onto lumen prepared conduit , commercially available , small-diameter ePTFE straight vascular graft ( IMPRA ePTFE Vascular Graft , item 80s06 , Bard Peripheral Vascular , Inc. ) This instrument system provide sterile flow-path , cell process separate . The flow-path contain within disposable cartridge interlock durable system hardware include flow-path cartridge fluid reservoirs disposable centrifuge cartridge . The system self contain , stand-alone system require AC power operate . The clinical trial process involve pilot ( feasibility ) study gain initial safety effectiveness data limit human population . A subsequent pivotal study conduct sufficient patient number demonstrate statistically significant improvement effectiveness define clinical endpoint gain important safety information specific clinical population .</detailed_description>
