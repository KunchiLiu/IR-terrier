	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify cancer-related gene turn turned order determine well patient respond study drug , panitumumab . Panitumumab add standard adjuvant primary radiation therapy . There subject receive surgery follow therapy subject receive radiation therapy without surgery . Subjects enter study locally advance disease treat surgery and/or radiation therapy . Fresh frozen tumor tissue available genomics analysis prior initiate panitumumab therapy . If fresh frozen tissue available time consent , biopsy require participate trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Gene Expression Signature Panitumumab Sensitivity Untreated Locally Advanced SCCHN</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial initiate identify gene expression signature profile biomarker panitumumab sensitivity locally advance , untreated SCCHN . SCCHN express express EGFR &gt; 90 % tumor . Panitumumab fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody approve treatment epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) express previously treat metastatic colorectal cancer . It compete endogenous ligand epidermal growth factor tumor growth factor-α block stimulation EGFR . Preclinical experiment show panitumumab direct anti-tumor activity activate cellular immune response SCCHN.This study provide opportunity well define population patient would benefit EGFR inhibition SCCHN . Patients receive single agent panitumumab `` window opportunity '' design prior definitive surgical radiation therapy . The decision treat primarily either surgery Radiation Therapy ( RT ) base therapy base best medical practice treat physician per National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline www.nccn.org . Response panitumumab monotherapy surgery radiation evaluate continuous variable , median split patient use develop signature drug responsiveness . An Affymetrix chip base gene signature model develop analyze gene expression panitumumab sensitive versus resistant tumor . Identification gene expression profile tumor sensitivity allow prospective trial treat patient population enrich likelihood clinical benefit panitumumab therapy . It also possible gene signature profile panitumumab responsiveness identify SCCHN could use biomarker epithelial cancer . Tumor response measure percentage decrease PET scan standardize uptake value ( SUV ) level objective evidence tumor response ( CT scan direct measurement ) basis examine activity panitumumab mean identify gene expression signature predict response patient population . Therefore , PET scan SUV level assess baseline prior treatment . If baseline PET/CT obtain lesion identify SUV level ≥6 , additional pre-treatment research PET/CT perform consent ( prior dose # 1 panitumumab . A second research PET/CT also obtain first dose panitumumab part research study . If baseline PET/CT obtain , research PET obtain pre-treatment ; SUV level ≥6 additional research PET obtain first dose panitumumab . All subject underwent imaging , biopsy single dose panitumumab 9mg/kg IV . Two three week panitumumab , image repeat second biopsy obtain ( surgery surgery patient ) optional biopsy patient receive RT . Subjects receive 2 additional dos panitumumab standard therapy .</detailed_description>
