	<brief_title>Intensified Azacitidine High Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open-label , multicenter phase I/II study . Treatment Regimen , Dosage Duration : Treatment consist azacitidine 75mg/m2/d 5 day every 14 day 4 cycle ( azacitidine-14 , cycle 1-4 ) . - Patients achieve CR PR treat 4 cycle azacitidine 75mg/m2/d 5 day administer every 21 day ( azacitidine-21 , cycle 5 8 ) follow cycle azacitidine 75mg/m2/d 7 day administer every 28 day ( azacitidine-28 , cycle 9 beyond ) , continue progression/relapse toxicity arises ) . - Patients obtain CR PR initial 4 cycle azacitidine-14 continue receive azacitidine 75mg/m2/d 5 day every 14 day 4 additional cycle ( cycle 5 8 ) . If achieve CR , PR HI 8 cycle , treat azacitidine 75mg/m2/d 5 day every 21 day ( azacitidine-21 , cycle 9 12 ) subsequently cycle azacitidine 75mg/m2/d 7 day administer every 28 day ( azacitidine-28 , cycle 13 beyond ) progression/relapse toxicity arises . - Patients obtain CR , PR HI 8 cycle azacitidine-14 go `` off-study '' . Number patient include : The trial enroll least 27 patient ( phase I trial ) maximum 81 patient ( phase II trial ) . A safety analysis perform independent DSMB inclusion 9 , 18 27 patient . This safety analysis focus particularly clinical consequence cytopenia . Moreover , teleconference organize twice monthly PI investigator share safety observation take appropriate action need . CRFs collect every cycle focus particularly safety dose intensify study . All AE SAE report DSMB upon reception . Primary Endpoint : -Response rate ( include CR PR ) accord IWG 2006 criterion MDS 4 8 cycle 75mg/m2/d azacitidine administer every 2 week . Secondary Endpoints : - Safety/toxicity profile azacitidine administer every 14 day ( NCI-CTAE ) - Responses ( CR , PR , marrow CR , HI ) accord IWG 2006 criterion duration - Overall survival progression ( IPSS/AML ) free survival . Sample Size Duration Trial : The first stage trial include 27 patient . The trial terminate 9 few response observe . Otherwise , additional patient recruit second stage total sample size 81 patient reach . Duration inclusion : 24 month 81 patient Duration follow-up : 24 month</detailed_description>
