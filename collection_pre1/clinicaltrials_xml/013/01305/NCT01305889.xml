	<brief_summary>The focus study gather preliminary data regard effect psychological therapy—Problem Solving Therapy—and antidepressant medication—sertraline—on 1 ) cerebral perfusion ( CP ) , 2 ) brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) , 3 ) measure cognitive function subject late life major depression ( LLMD ) . This research goal achieve recruit 38 individual age 65 LLMD . The primary outcome change CP , change BDNF , change cognitive measure baseline end 12 week either therapy . We also examine predictor treatment outcome include severity executive dysfunction , baseline BDNF concentration , baseline CP measure . The baseline neuropsychological testing , brain imaging , depression assessment obtain companion study ( PI S. Mackin ; CHR # H42689-32681-01 ) IRB approve already progress . In current study baseline serum BDNF level add Dr. Mackin 's protocol . Patients receive either 12 week Problem Solving Therapy antidepressant treatment sertraline . Both treatment evidence base commonly administer clinic . Outcome variables measure depression severity , BDNF serum concentration , cerebral perfusion use MRI arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) technique cognitive change memory executive dysfunction . This preliminary pilot study . The primary objective determine method appear feasible determine change BDNF CP occur treatment secondarily determine change cognitive functioning . The study power show difference treatment . The hypothesis 1 ) PST result increase perfusion frontal region brain frontal perfusion change sertraline ; 2 ) sertraline result increase BDNF PST . Change cognitive measure memory , learn , executive dysfunction examine exploratory basis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Problem Solving Therapy Antidepressant Therapy Cerebral Perfusion Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor ( BDNF ) Depressed Elders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects : subject non-psychotic unipolar major depression base DSM IV criterion ( Structured Clinical Interview DSM IV ; SCID ) 65 year old depression moderate great depression severity ( Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score &gt; = 19 . Depression severity assess clinician rat Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) subject rat Quick Inventory Depressive Symptoms ( QIDS ) . Ratings perform weekly first month every 2 week end trial . Neuroimaging : The MRI study include protocol commonly utilized clinical practice . In addition conventional structural MRI , protocol utilize technique develop evaluate cerebral blood flow ( arterial spin label ) , white matter integrity ( diffusion tensor image ) , brain biochemistry ( MR spectroscopy ) perform use 4 Tesla magnet . Imaging perform VAMC/UCSF Center Imaging Neurodegenerative Disease ( CIND ) direction Michael Weiner , M.D . Brain derive neurotropic factor ( BDNF ) : blood sample drawn pretreatment determine serum concentration BDNF . This test repeat post-treatment . The assay BDNF perform laboratory Synthia Mellon , Ph.D UCSF . Serum assay BDNF duplicate , use commercial BDNF ELISA assay kit ( R &amp; D Systems , Minneapolis , MN , USA ) . Cognition assess battery neuropsychological test include Stroop Color-Word Test , Trail Making Test : A B ; Dementia Rating Scale I/P ; Boston Naming Test , Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Short . Treatment assignment : If patient preference PST sertraline , receive treatment . If preference , randomize one 19 subject assign treatment . Sertraline , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , administer antidepressant . It start 25 mg/day one week increase 50 mg continue 3 week . At end 4 week patient limited response , dose increase 100 mg/day . At 8 week response limit , dose increase 150 mg/day . At time , dose lower tolerability reason . Problem Solving Therapy . Patients receive PST see weekly 12 individual 45 minute session . Problem Solving Therapy ( Arean , Raue , Julian ; UCSF unpublished manuscript , 2003 ) consist 12 weekly session teach participant five-step problem-solving model . This model teach first five week treatment . Subsequent session dedicate refine PST skill . In last two PST session , participant create relapse prevention plan use PST model . There two therapist study trained perform PST experience prior study PST MDD old adult . Data analyze Drs Nelson Mackin consultation Kevin Delucchi , Ph.D. ( Department Biostatistics/Psychiatry ; UCSF ) . All analysis perform within treatment group ( psychotherapy drug treatment ) compare baseline value post-treatment value patient complete least 8 week treatment . All analyse begin graphically numerically summarize measure assess distribution score . To statistically control appropriate association demographic variable ( age , sex , education ) clinical variable ( social support , medical comorbidity , physical frailty , medication use ) outcome measure , use linear regression model method . Missing data , , carefully describe analyze . The methodology use assume miss random ( MAR ) reasonable assumption type data relatively low level miss data anticipate base prior research population . Because specific priori hypothesis regard BDNF composite score executive dysfunction , correct multiple comparison . Analysis cerebral blood flow data , however , employ correction multiple comparison . As stated aim study gather preliminary data regard change baseline study endpoint within sertraline within PST treatment group . Attrition estimate 20 % allow 15 patient complete treatment arm .</detailed_description>
