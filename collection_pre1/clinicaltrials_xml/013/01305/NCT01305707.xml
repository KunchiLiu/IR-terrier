	<brief_title>Continuation Electroconvulsive Therapy ( C-ECT ) Relapse Prevention Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) severe psychiatric disorder affect 6 million people country life prevalence 8.9 % men 16 . 5 % woman ( Haro et al , 2007 ) . Besides , recent decade , incidence increase ( Kessler et al , 2004 ) . MDD high recurrence rate 25 % case develop chronification . Moreover occur age lead severe disability . The majority study publish field demonstrate efficacy antidepressant treatment short medium-term basis , lack long-term clinical trial regard antidepressant efficacy publish one present methodological problem . At present , line fundamental research therapeutic include pragmatic study answer crucial specific question clinical practice . Therefore , aim project conduct pragmatic , parallel , randomized trial 2 treatment arm answer key question great interest psychiatrist : Is effective extend use ECT maintenance therapy ( together drug therapy ) rather use drug therapy patient previously require acute ECT course depressive episode ? This study control randomized clinical trial start remission acute depressive episode . Once patient clinically remit randomize two group : 1 . C-ECT together pharmacotherapy ( treatment use acute episode ) . 2 . Maintenance pharmacotherapy treatment ( treatment use acute episode ) . Consolidation treatment ECT consider finish 9 month start , time patient stay pharmacological treatment already . The study complete within 15 month patient inclusion ( six month end C-ECT ) . Patient assessment follow-up conduct participant researcher . Blind rater conduct clinical adverse effect rating . A neuropsychologist conduct neuropsychological assessment .</detailed_description>
