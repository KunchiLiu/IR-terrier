	<brief_summary>Adult female smoker participate exercise-aided smoking cessation program , randomize one four cessation maintenance condition : ( ) Exercise Maintenance ( b ) Exercise Maintenance + Relapse Prevention Booklets ( c ) Relapse Prevention Booklets + Contact ( ) Contact Control . Primary follow-up outcome smoking behaviour . Secondary outcome include exercise behaviour , Physiological measure ( body composition ( Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry ; DXA ) , vascular health ( stiffness , endothelial function , carotid plaque volume ) , physical fitness ) , Psychological measure ( self-regulatory cognition relate exercise adherence [ exercise , scheduling , barrier , relapse , concurrent self-regulatory self-efficacy ] ) . The hypothesis detail specific randomization participant follow 4 group : 1 . Exercise Maintenance 2 . Exercise Maintenance + Relapse Prevention Booklets 3 . Relapse Prevention Booklets + Contact 4 . Contact Control Hypothesis 1 : Compared quitter contact control condition , quitter expose home-based lifestyle exercise maintenance intervention ( Exercise Maintenance Exercise Maintenance + Relapse Prevention Booklets ) demonstrate significantly great exercise adherence fitness level , well significantly less weight gain smoking relapse rate follow exercise-aided smoking cessation program termination . Hypothesis 2 : Compared quitter contact control condition , quitter expose relapse information ( Relapse Prevention Booklets + Contact ) experience significantly less smoking relapse follow exercise-aided smoking cessation program termination . Due novelty exploratory nature respective prevention program , hypothesis specify respect prevention program ( exercise maintenance relapse prevention information ) superior , whether additive benefit ( i.e. , exercise maintenance plus relapse prevention information ) superior one prevention program alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adding exercise cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) show aid smoking cessation lessen negative consequence withdrawal symptom ( Marcus et al. , 1999 ; Ussher , 2005 ) . Recently , Prapavessis colleague ( 2007 ) demonstrate 12-week program , consist supervise vigorous intensity exercise adjunct nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) , facilitate smoke cessation , improve physical fitness , delay weight gain woman smoker . However , smoke relapse effect show post-intervention , illustrate trend , abstinence decrease , physical fitness show corresponding decrease increase weight ( also see , Marcus et al. ) . These result suggest exercise need maintain effective aid smoking cessation . In practice , long-term supervise structured vigorous exercise regimes beyond scope smoke cessation service . Therefore , important determine whether exercise intervention program develop maintain weight physical fitness program termination , thus prevent ( reduce ) smoking relapse . Teaching smoker necessary self-regulatory skill need abstain smoke adhere exercise independently may promise avenue ensure last health behaviour change . The Getting Physical Cigarettes program begin January 2010 . The main purpose project examine whether inexpensive , home-based lifestyle exercise maintenance intervention demonstrate sustain health benefit term weight gain physical fitness benefit follow exercise Nicotine Replacement Therapy ( NRT ) aid smoking cessation program . In addition , trial seek examine previously unexplored topic interest smoking abstinence literature ; specifically , interested whether nicotine metabolite ratio ( 3-HC/Cotinine : Schnoll et al. , 2009 ) useful biomarker determine cessation success relation exercise Nicotine Replacement Therapy ( NRT ) treatment , whether interactive effect exercise smoke cessation improve vascular health lung function . Four hundred twenty adult female smoker follow structure supervise 14 week exercise-aided smoking cessation program , 10 week NRT program begin week 4 . Participants randomize one four condition : ) Exercise Maintenance ; b ) Exercise Maintenance + Relapse Prevention Booklets ; c ) Relapse Prevention Booklets + Contact ; ) Contact Control . Starting week 8 , woman Exercise Maintenance condition engage Group-Mediated Cognitive Behavioural ( GMCB ) therapy relate maintain exercise home environment , woman Contact condition partake group mediate discussion related health issue . The `` Forever Free '' smoke replase prevention book series ( Brandon , Collins , Juliano , &amp; Lazev , 2000 ) distribute participant Relapse Prevention Booklets condition ; however , group receive amount supervise exercise session NRT . Following termination 14 week intervention participant contact trained facilitator , deliver 15 minute biweekly ( first month ) , monthly ( next 2 month ) , bimonthly ( last 8 month ) intervention strategy phone continue counsel woman accord particular group-mediated condition . Primary end point ( i.e. , smoke abstinence ) assess weekly throughout 14 week program follow-ups 3 , 6 , 12 month . Secondary end point ( i.e. , fitness , vascular health [ e.g. , endothelial function , carotid plaque volume ] , lung function , weight self-regulatory cognition ) assess baseline week 14 well 12 month . Accelerometers ( ACTICALÃ’ ) use obtain objective measure physical activity baseline , week 15 ( 1 week 14 week intervention ) 6 12 month . The Getting Physical Cigarettes trial contribute well understanding role exercise play aid smoking cessation , also explore mean increase cost-effectiveness long-term smoking cessation program . The finding result trial may important implication improve quality life among individual wish stop smoking , would , turn , significant impact cost health care Canadian public .</detailed_description>
