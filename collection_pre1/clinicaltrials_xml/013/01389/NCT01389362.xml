	<detailed_description>There global epidemic diabetes obesity affect 300 million people worldwide Asia forefront . In Hong Kong , diabetes affect 10 % population . Patients diabetes 12—25 % lifetime risk develop foot ulcer . These silent condition independently collectively contribute 50 % cause death mainly due cardiovascular renal complication . Type 2 diabetes complex disorder characterize constellation cardiovascular risk factor , notably , hyperglycemia , obesity , dyslipidemia ( high triglyceride ( TG ) low HDL-C ) , hypertension , microinflammation prothrombotic state , often refer metabolic syndrome . The public health implication diabetes lie mainly devastate chronic complication due generalize vascular dysfunction . In patient diabetes metabolic syndrome , loss cellular structure function due apoptosis , angiogenesis fibrosis eventually manifest overt diabetic complication , cardiovascular disease , neuropathy , retinopathy nephropathy . The abnormal metabolic milieu hyperglycemia , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , pro-thrombotic state chronic inflammation diabetes cause atherosclerosis . A significant proportion subject underlying peripheral arterial disease neuropathy . These subject great risk develop infective foot ulceration secondary impair vascular supply , sensory loss minor trauma . Without prompt proper medical treatment , infective ulcer deteriorate lead gangrene limb amputation . Age , wound depth , presence ischaemia , low albumin level , lack simultaneous ulceration significant independent predictor unfavourable outcome . The conventional management diabetic foot ulcer include rest , antibiotic therapy , surgical debridement good glycemic control . The investigator previously demonstrate use recipe contain 12 herbs effective promote heal severe chronic non-healing diabetic foot ulcer achieve 85 % limb preservation . In-vitro in-vivo study reveal 5 12 herb effective promote fibroblast proliferation angiogenesis . To minimize potential drug interaction adverse effect multiple component recipe Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) , investigator develop simplify formula 12 herb consist two herb . Many herb long use treat diabetes mellitus complication . In many successful attempt Radix Rehmanniae ( RR ) Radix Astragali ( RA ) frequently use combination herbs form complex formulae 'blood-house blood stasis-dispelling decoction additive ingredient ' 'pills six drug Rehmannia ' . Based previous in-vitro in-vivo study , new reformulate recipe herbal medicine develop . In proof-of-concept study , investigator hypothesize novel recipe herbal medicine expedite heal early foot ulcer promote vascularisation granulation well modulate inflammatory response . Results provide valuable insight understand application TCM management diabetic foot ulcer , particular , effect angiogenesis anti-inflammation . New intellectual property develop provide foundation future research . Such integrated approach bench bedside serve model platform development TCM Hong Kong . The study investigate whether two-herb recipe increase wound heal patient diabetes mellitus . Primary outcome : 1 . Resolution/progression foot ulcer base PEDIS 2 . Failure treatment i.e . improvement 6 month , rapid deterioration emergency surgery require Secondary outcome : 1 . Hospital admission/attendance/stay 2 . Metabolic parameter</detailed_description>
