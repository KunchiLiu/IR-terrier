	<brief_title>Instrumental Sealing Arterial Puncture Site Closure Device Versus Manual Compression Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular closure device show safe effective reducing time hemostasis immobilization compare manual compression follow coronary angiography . This effect beneficial patient present chronic back pain , prostate enlargement , mental impairment disorder preclude prolonged bed rest . However , adequately power large scale randomize trial vascular closure device remain gap scientific literature . This trial compare , randomise design two novel vascular closure device ( FemoSeal &amp; ExoSeal ) versus manual compression coronary angiography . This study aim investigate novel vascular closure device noninferior manual compression regard access site complication .</detailed_description>
