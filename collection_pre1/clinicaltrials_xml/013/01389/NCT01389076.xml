	<brief_summary>Patients type non-Hodgkin lymphoma , call follicular lymphoma yet previous systemic treatment , chemotherapy immunotherapy invite participate . This research study conduct order evaluate combination lowdose methotrexate Iodine I 131 tositumomab ( Bexxar ) regard whether combination reduce occurrence HAMA ( Human Anti-Mouse Antibody ) response . HAMA immune reaction tositumomab protein . Symptoms arise HAMA range mild form , like rash , extreme possibly life-threatening level . HAMA also decrease effectiveness treatment , create future reaction patient give another treatment contain mouse antibody . In addition evaluate occurrence HAMA , research study also look short long-term effectiveness combination treatment lymphoma , well safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Low-Dose Methotrexate I 131 Tositumomab Previously Untreated , Advanced-Stage , Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , single institution , Phase II study test use low-dose methotrexate combination I-131 tositumomab ability lower rate ( human anti-mouse antibody ) HAMA formation patient previously untreated low-grade follicular lymphoma . Low-dose methotrexate give begin 3 week prior first infusion I-131 tositumomab ( 4 weekly dos ) continue 6 week ( 10 total dos ) , period time development HAMA detrimental . A total 61 patient enrol . The primary endpoint study determination rate HAMA conversion within first seven week follow treatment . The secondary endpoint include response rate , progression-free overall survival , safety .</detailed_description>
