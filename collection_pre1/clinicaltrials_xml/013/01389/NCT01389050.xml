	<brief_summary>This research study aim define 1 ) retroperitoneal sarcomas change course radiotherapy 2 ) radiotherapy affect well-being . While investigator know radiotherapy surgery safe effective , amount tumor motion size change radiotherapy unknown . There also little information describe side-effects radiotherapy treatment disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Precision RT For Soft-Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soft-tissue sarcoma ( STS ) arise retroperitoneum rare malignancy anatomical locate deep within abdominal area thus pose challenge surgical radiotherapeutic management patient . As result , local control overall survival patient retroperitoneal sarcoma ( RPS ) bad STS extremity . Current treatment strategy involve pre-operative radiotherapy follow surgery . Use intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) RPS allow conformal treatment aim spar normal tissue high dos irradiation . Yet accuracy coverage IMRT depend highly target motion , little known motion RPS course radiotherapy . As well , RPS commonly close proximity sensitive organ long-term toxicity effect quality life secondary radiation unknown . The current study seek evaluate extent tumor motion radiotherapy impact radiotherapy patient toxicity quality life . At conclusion study , result hopefully identify optimum PTV , importance different normal tissue dose-volume constraint , role image guidance , potential dose escalation treatment RPS .</detailed_description>
