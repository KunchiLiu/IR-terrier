	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Adjunctive Treatment Laser Panretinal Photocoagulation Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current gold standard treatment proliferative diabetic retinopathy panretinal photocoagulation . Therefore study design use treatment patient : intravitreal Bevacizumab plus panretinal photocoagulation one eye , compare panretinal photocoagulation alone contralateral eye . These patient visual acuity contrast vision measure complete ophthalmological examination perform , include macular slit lamp examination , fluorescein angiography optical coherence tomography . Patients similar proliferative diabetic retinopathy without high risk characteristic receive laser therapy eye intravitreal Bevacizumab injection one eye . For Bevacizumab injection , numb drop , antibiotic drop , drop dilate pupil , possibly anesthetic injection , put eye medicine inject vitreous . Patients return follow-up visit 1 day , 1 4 week injection , 3 6 month . Patients whose condition improve may undergo new evaluation .</detailed_description>
