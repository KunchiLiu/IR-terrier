	<brief_summary>The long-term goal study foster development dissemination evidence-based behavioral pharmacological treatment reduce HIV transmission , injection drug use ( IDU ) , heroin use Russia . This study examine effect combine behavioral therapy naltrexone pharmacotherapy treatment opiate dependence reduction HIV risk opiate dependent individual . Specifically study determine whether extended-release injection naltrexone great efficacy cost-effective oral naltrexone maintenance , whether behavioral drug HIV risk reduction counseling ( BDRC ) combine brief , medical management ( MM ) great efficacy cost-effective MM , whether particular combination medication formulation counseling ( MM MM plus BDRC ) great efficacy cost-effective combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Naltrexone Behavioral Drug HIV Risk Reduction Counseling Russia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With estimate 1.6-4 million opiate user ( majority injection drug use ( IDU ) ) 940,000 HIV infected individual ( 80 % link IDU ) , Russian Federation face prospect explosive HIV epidemic . Currently Russia , inpatient detoxification follow oral naltrexone maintenance ( NMT ) pharmacologic treatment opiate dependence . Evidence-based counseling reduce HIV transmission relapse follow detoxification widely available routinely provide . Several consideration , include data preliminary study , suggest efficacy NMT may improve use extended-release naltrexone ( XR/NTX ) instead oral naltrexone ( O/NTX ) combine NMT behavioral drug HIV risk reduction counseling ( BDRC ) . BDRC may also improve medication adherence promote behavioral change lead reduce relapse risk , IDU , drug- sex-related HIV risk behavior . However , efficacy cost-effectiveness reduce drug- sex-related HIV risk behavior increase duration opioid abstinence various combination naltrexone formulation ( O/NTX vs. XR/NTX ) counseling ( MM combine BDRC ) systematically evaluate . Consequently , propose 2x2 factorial randomize clinical trial evaluate efficacy cost-effectiveness two medication formulation ( O/NTX XR/NTX ) two manual-guided counseling condition ( MM MM+BDRC ) potential interaction medication counsel condition . Following detoxification , opiate dependent subject ( N=320 ) randomly assign 6 month treatment one four treatment group : O/NTX+MM , XR/NTX+MM , O/NTX+MM+BDRC , XR/NTX+MM+BDRC . Primary outcome measure include reduction sex- drug-related HIV risk behavior , reduction illicit opiate use , treatment retention . Other outcome measure include reduction frequency opiate drug use , health status healthcare utilization , criminal behavior arrest , improvement vocational family function quality life . All study participant assess baseline monthly 6 month treatment phase 6 month follow active treatment phase . Data analyse focus intention-to treat sample . The study result allow evaluation whether XR/NTX superior efficacy cost-effective O/NTX , whether BDRC plus MM superior efficacy cost-effective MM , whether particular combination medication counsel superior efficacy cost-effective combination .</detailed_description>
