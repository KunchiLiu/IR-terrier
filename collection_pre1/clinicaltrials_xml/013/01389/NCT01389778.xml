	<brief_summary>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) common endocrine disorder reproductive age woman . Women PCOS high risk prediabetes , type 2 diabetes heart disease . The investigator find possible change DNA ( gene body encode trait ) seem related insulin resistance . In study , investigator try determine whether change gene affect woman 's ability respond common treatment PCOS , metformin . These study uncover change gene might one cause PCOS . Discovering gene help well understand diabetes insulin abnormality common PCOS help u good diagnose treat PCOS prevent diabetes woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) , affect 7-10 % reproductive age woman , traditionally classified reproductive dermatologic syndrome high rate infertility cosmetic complication hyperandrogenism . However , become increasingly clear insulin resistance important pathogenesis disorder . There number variant determine associate PCOS risk . The investigator determine effect variant phenotype response treatment PCOS . Subjects PCOS undergo extensive phenotyping include adipose tissue biopsy , dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA , bone density ) scan examine adipose store , intravenous glucose tolerance test study insulin sensitivity beta cell function , androgen stimulation inflammatory marker . The phenotyping repeat 3 month treatment metformin . The study determine whether genotype PCOS risk variant dictate phenotype response treatment metformin . Discovering gene involve etiology PCOS help pull u endless circle characterize understanding PCOS pathophysiology many year . The proposal also potential illuminate one etiology insulin resistance , present even lean woman PCOS , impair glucose tolerance diabetes find 40 % PCOS patient .</detailed_description>
