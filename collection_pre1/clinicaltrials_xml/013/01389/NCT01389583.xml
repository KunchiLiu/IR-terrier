	<brief_title>A Study AUY922 GIST ( Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ; pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic phase II study AUY922 patient advance GIST fail intolerance imatinib sunitinib therapy . AUY922 novel HSP90 inhibitor administer dose 70 mg/m2 i.v . infusion D1 every week . The Simon one sample two-stage minimax design use 15 suitable patient accrue first stage . If least two patient meet primary endpoint ( complete response＋partial response＋stable disease≧4 month ) , additional 10 patient would recruit second stage . AUY922 would consider active patient population , 5 case non-progressive disease total cohort 25 patient .</detailed_description>
