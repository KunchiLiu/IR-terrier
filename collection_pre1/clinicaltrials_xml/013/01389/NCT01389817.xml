	<brief_summary>The overall objective propose research test hypothesis Near-infrared Light-emitting Diode ( NIR-LED ) therapy stimulate mitochondrial function , attenuate oxidative stress , improve cell survival vision subject Leber 's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy ( LHON ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Near-infrared Light-emitting Diode ( NIR-LED ) Therapy Leber 's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy ( LHON )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine effect short term ( 3 month ) near-infrared light NIR-LED therapy anatomic functional abnormality LHON assess wide variety ophthalmologic test , include visual acuity , optical coherence tomography , pattern electroretinography ( pERG ) N95 retinal ganglion cell peak , fERG-PhNR ( flash ERG - Photopic Negative Response ) , fundus photography .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Sex male female . Men affect visual loss frequently woman , male predominance ~85 % . A minimum 25 % men 5 % woman risk LHON experience visual loss . Age 18 year old . The onset visual loss typically occur age 15 35 year , otherwise classic LHON report many individual young old , range age onset 2 80 year . Diagnosis LHON carrier gene mutation . Patient must evaluate molecular confirmation , 11778 mutation Leber 's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy stratify later data analysis . Able &amp; willing provide inform consent Has optic nerve disease LHON . Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . Participation investigational trial within 30 day NIRLED treatment involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry . ( Note : subject receive another investigational drug participate study first 6 month . ) Major surgery within 28 day prior participation major surgery plan next 6 month . Major surgery define surgical procedure extensive fine needle biopsy/aspiration , placement central venous access device , removal/biopsy skin lesion , placement peripheral venous catheter .</criteria>
