	<brief_title>A Follow Study Intramuscular Olanzapine Depot Patients With Schizophrenia Schizoaffective Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since introduction United States Europe mid-1990s , olanzapine distinguish antipsychotic medication ( include `` atypical '' compound ) superior efficacy safety profile ( Beasley et al . 1996a , 1996b ; Tollefson et al . 1997 ) .

Accordingly , `` atypical '' depot olanzapine , administer every 2 4 week , develop enhance convenience compliance antipsychotic therapy . The depot formulation olanzapine ( LY170053 ) evaluate study olanzapine pamoate monohydrate ( OPM ) ( salt pamoic acid olanzapine ) , suitable deep intramuscular injection . Olanzapine Pamoate ( OP ) Depot ( formerly refer IM olanzapine depot previous version protocol ) consist OPM powder , suspend aqueous vehicle immediately prior use . Several pamoate salt register drug product currently approve chronic oral administration United States ( example , hydroxyzine pamoate imipramine pamoate ) . Another pamoate salt depot intramuscular injection also approve US ( TrelstarTM LA , triptorelin pamoate injectable suspension ) treatment prostate cancer . As March 2002 , pamoate formulation OP Depot test 12 healthy subject approximately 250 patient schizophrenia 2 clinical pharmacology study , F1D-EW-LOAZ F1D-EW-LOBE , respectively , one receptor occupancy ( positron emission tomography ) study , F1D-EW-HGJW . Dosages include single dos 450mg multiple dos 405mg every 4weeks . This open-label study ass long-term efficacy 280 mg 405mg OP Depot administer 3-week interval patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder</detailed_description>
