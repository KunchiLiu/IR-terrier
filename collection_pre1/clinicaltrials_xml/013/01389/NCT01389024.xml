	<brief_summary>This pilot study hydroxyurea versus placebo reduce central nervous system complication ( abnormally fast blood flow brain , silent cerebral infarct stroke ) young child sickle cell disease . The investigator plan identify child 12 48 month old without central nervous system complication randomly assign 20 treatment hydroxyurea 20 treatment placebo 36 month . Neither study doctor participant know treatment receiving .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke , silent cerebral infarct ( SCI ) , cognitive impairment frequent highly morbid complication sickle cell disease ( SCD ) child . Current approach prevention treatment neurological complication SCD include screen transcranial Doppler ultrasound ( TCD ) identify child elevate cerebral blood flow velocity increase risk stroke ; child typically treat chronic transfusion indefinitely . Hydroxyurea ( HU ) may beneficial effect central nervous system ( CNS ) complication SCD reduce frequency painful crisis , acute chest syndrome transfusion . The safety HU infants child suggest National Institutes Health ( NIH ) sponsor phase III trial ; however , exact indication use HU child remain unclear , well efficacy prevent central nervous system ( CNS ) complication SCD . Our preliminary data suggest , cumulative frequency abnormal TCD , SCI stroke could reduce 50 % , majority pediatric hematologist would prescribe HU young child SCD . The long term goal project perform primary prevention trial demonstrate neuroprotective effect HU broaden indication HU child . The goal proposal : 1 ) conduct internal pilot randomize placebo-controlled trial HU reduce CNS complication SCD ( term internal pilot use , result participant pilot analyzed part definitive phase III trial follow ) ; 2 ) demonstrate safety hydroxyurea study procedure young child SCD ; 3 ) create leadership , network clinical center procedure necessary conduct definitive phase III trial demonstrate efficacy HU primary prevention neurological complication SCD . The primary endpoint internal pilot definitive phase III trial development abnormal TCD , SCI , TIA stroke . To begin internal pilot trial , investigator obtain Clinical Translational Science Award ( CTSA ) support Johns Hopkins Washington University ; sit screen 40 participant 9-48 month age randomly assign follow 20 participant three year . Four additional center ( Children 's Hospital Philadelphia , Vanderbilt University , Children 's Hospital Medical Center , Cincinnati University Alabama , Birmingham ) begin enrollment ( 20 patient screen 10 participant randomly assign per site ) , provide total 80 participant screen , 40 randomly assign , minimum 70 participant year follow-up . Additional sit add . Participants must TCD measurement well transfusion threshold magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) brain without evidence SCI . Participants internal pilot continue phase III trial , complete 3 year HU placebo . The information internal pilot trial use improve design definitive phase III trial . The result study could lead true primary prevention CNS complication SCD , include abnormal TCD , SCI , neurocognitive impairment stroke . In , study could also reduce burden chronic transfusion change clinical practice broaden indication HU .</detailed_description>
