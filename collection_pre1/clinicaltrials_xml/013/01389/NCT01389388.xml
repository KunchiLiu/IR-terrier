	<brief_summary>Patients rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS ) great risk develop cardiovascular disease . The reason ( ) well investigate , general understand systemic inflammation play part increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . In spite increase risk patient , include high risk patient group cardiovascular prevention guideline . The investigator carry cardiovascular study RA AS patient , well patient arthritis first time . The investigator demonstrate cholesterol plaque carotid artery patient . Plaques carotid artery represent risk development cerebral stroke significantly associate myocardial infarction . These plaque , asymptomatic cause haemodynamically significant narrowing , diameter reduction ( i.e . operation indicate ) , vascular atheromatous disease . Therefore , accord prevail cardiovascular guideline ( SCORE 2007 ) , patient shall secondary prevention lipid lower agent LDL-cholesterol goal 1.8 mmol/L HDL-cholesterol &gt; 1.0 mmol/L men &gt; 1.1 mmol/L woman . Statins cholesterol-lowering drug , show reduce risk cardiovascular disease significantly . In addition , reduction size coronary plaque induce statin , LDL reduce 1.6-1.8 mmol/l . Plaques carotid coronary artery previously treat characterized patient RA , AS inflammatory form arthritis . The aim study treat patient cholesterol plaque carotid artery cholesterol-lowering medication , form Rosuvastatin 18 month , characterize effect plaque carotid coronary artery . In addition , investigator want clarify connection plaque carotid coronary artery patient RA , AS inflammatory form arthritis .</brief_summary>
