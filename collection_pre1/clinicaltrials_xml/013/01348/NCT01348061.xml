	<brief_summary>This experimental medicine study evaluate kinetics cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) biomarkers subject Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) compare healthy control use heavy water ( 2H2O ) labeling method . This study explore time profile appearance disappearance pulse deuterium-labeled cargo protein CSF subject AD and/or PSP , different healthy control , due deficit fast axonal transport .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To compare time profile appearance disappearance CSF pulse deuterium-labeled chromogranin B , sAPPα β-Trace AD PSP subject compare healthy control . Secondary Objectives : - To measure body water enrichment deuterium saliva plasma ( 2H-enrichment ( % ) ) - To explore effect age kinetics deuterium label CSF biomarkers - To assess intra inter subject variability deuterium-labeling chromogranin B , sAPPα β-Trace Subjects undergo screen evaluation determine eligibility prior heavy water ( 2H20 ) administration . Eligible subject admit clinical facility Day -1 . On Day 1 , subject ingest small dos 2H20 inpatient stay . They also drink 2H20 7 day . Subjects undergo two lumbar puncture ( LPs ) CSF sample . Subjects return study site approximately 7 day last LP ( early termination ) follow-up assessment discharge .</detailed_description>
