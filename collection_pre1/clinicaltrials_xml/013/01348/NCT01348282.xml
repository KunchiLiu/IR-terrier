	<brief_summary>The current project propose comparison two pharmacologic strategy adjunctive treatment improvement HIV-associated neurocognitive disruption , additionally use HAART . The investigator propose use compound show great benefit context date , lithium , versus use well-tolerated promising drug pathology neurocognitive affectation , Alzheimer Parkinson diseases , rivastigmine . In disease , second compound recently offer good tolerability , also benefit attention , memory neurocognitive area . Both study group , patient therapy lithium patient therapy rivastigmine , compare control group , initiate treatment ( therefore continue antiretroviral therapy ) . The investigator aware proposal offer new relevant data study neurocognitive improvement HIV infection , well allow good knowledge clinical management HIV-infected patient CNS disease , aspect common clinical concern today .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Two Pharmacologic Strategies Neurocognitive Impairment HIV Infection . The TRIANT-TE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adjunctive treatment base neurocognitive improvement HIV-infected patient CNS disruption consist essentially neurostimulant neuroprotective treatment . Reports publish date involve valproic acid , peptide T , CPI-1189 , selegiline , memantine , minocycline lithium . Regarding valproic acid , two trial confirm lack benefit use compound HIV-associated neurocognitive decline . In case peptide T , CPI-1189 , selegiline , memantine minocycline , although potential mechanism brain follow different pathway , trend towards improvement neurocognitive functioning observe . Nonetheless , result trial particularly base short term , moreover , mild connection benefit neurocognitive functional measure establish . The lithium compound show clear benefit regard . Two report consistently demonstrate benefit neurocognitive performance use neuroprotective agent , patient HIV show impairment previously . However , lithium well know drug easily incorporate routine practice , least psychiatry context . In addition , adverse event relate use relatively frequent , therefore clinical follow-up must especially control . Besides , lithium concentration also concern aspect consider use , drug plasma level recommend perform throughout therapy application . For reason , current project propose comparison two pharmacologic strategy adjunctive treatment improvement HIV-associated neurocognitive disruption , additionally use HAART . The investigator propose use compound show great benefit context date , lithium , versus use well-tolerated promising drug pathology neurocognitive affectation , Alzheimer Parkinson diseases , rivastigmine . In disease , second compound recently offer good tolerability , also benefit attention , memory neurocognitive area . Furthermore , case project , rivastigmine suggest use transdermal system patch , fact provide suitability comfortability regard select administration method . Both study group , patient therapy lithium patient therapy rivastigmine , compare control group , initiate treatment ( therefore continue antiretroviral therapy ) . The investigator aware proposal offer new relevant data study neurocognitive improvement HIV infection , well allow good knowledge clinical management HIV-infected patient CNS disease , aspect common clinical concern today .</detailed_description>
