	<brief_summary>Background : - Tumors adrenal gland common . Most cancerous . However , test accurately tell adrenal tumor cancerous . The way tell remove tumor surgery examine . Researchers use new method study sample adrenal tissue . These method may help identify whether cell may become cancerous without operation . This information help doctor determine tumor need remove . Objectives : - To collect adrenal tumor tissue biopsy sample order study evaluate new method may help identify cancerous precancerous cell . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age adrenal tumor may may cancerous . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood urine test , image study . - Participants examine determine whether specific type adrenal tumor ( pheochromocytoma ) . - Participants whose tumor secrete hormone tumor biopsy collect tissue study . - Participants large tumor one secrete hormone standard surgery remove tumor . Tissue collect study . - Researchers examine collect tissue . They try determine whether cell cancerous may become cancerous . - Participants ask return National Institutes Health Clinical Center every year 5 year . During visit image study , lab test , physical examination ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Molecular Markers Adrenal Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Adrenal neoplasms common incidentally discover 4-10 % abdominal imaging study . - The majority adrenal incidentalomas cortical adenoma . - Many patient nonfunctioning adrenal incidentalomas undergo adrenalectomy exclude cancer diagnosis . - There reliable clinical , radiographic laboratory study accurately distinguish localize benign malignant adrenal neoplasm . - This protocol design determine feasibility accuracy use novel molecular marker malignant adrenal neoplasm fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy surgically resect sample . Objectives : - Primary Objectives : - To evaluate feasibility molecular test adrenal neoplasm FNA biopsy sample . - To determine accuracy novel diagnostic molecular marker clinical adrenal FNA biopsy surgically resect sample . - Secondary Objectives : - To analyze gene expression level relative disease-free survival overall survival patient adrenocortical carcinoma Eligibility : - An individual adrenal neoplasm great 2cm size - Age great 18 year - Adults must able understand sign inform consent document Design : - Prospective observational study . - Demographic , clinical , laboratory pathologic data collect patient participant . Data securely store computerized database . - Patients biochemical test determine adrenal neoplasm function nonfunctioning . - After initial on-study evaluation , patient find nonfunctioning adrenal tumor low risk malignancy re-screened every year 5 year non-invasive imaging study . - Treatment patient adrenal neoplasm perform base standard clinical practice . - Projected accrual 50 patient per year total 10 year . Thus , anticipate accrue 500 patient protocol .</detailed_description>
