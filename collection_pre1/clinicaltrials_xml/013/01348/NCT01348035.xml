	<detailed_description>Abstract Background Increased water intake slow autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) progression animal model , clinical implication find unknown . Methods The prospective one-year study conduct 34 ADPKD patient creatinine clearanceâ‰§50 ml/min/1.73m2 . Prior enrollment , 30 patient annually evaluate TKV 24-hour urine one year . Patients divide high ( H- , n = 18 ) free ( F- , n = 16 ) water-intake group . Total kidney volume ( TKV ) measure begin end study . Twenty-four-hour urine blood analyze every four month . Results Prior study , urine volume ( UV ) H-group high ( P = 0.034 ) , pertinent data include TKV kidney function slop significantly different two group . During study , UV increase ( P &lt; 0.001 ) H-group F-group . Plasma copeptin lower ( P = 0.024 ) H-group F-group . Kidney function TKV slop become bad H-group ( P = 0.011 0.047 , respectively ) F-group . High UV associate increased urine sodium ( UNa ) rapid decrease eGFR ( Eqcr-cys ) ( MDRD equation cystatin C incorporate ) ( P = 0.043 ) . UNa positively correlate % increase TKV ( P = 0.014 ) plasma copeptin weakly increase TKV ( P = 0.038 ) , respectively . Conclusions Although statistical significance reach , high water intake appear accelerate rather prevent disease progression , finding necessitate long-term randomize study draw final conclusion .</detailed_description>
