	<brief_summary>Healthy individual type 2 diabetes receive intensive counseling food selection improve glucose control use either high cereal fiber dietary strategy low glycemic index food especially canola oil contain bread . The treatment last 3 month blood take HbA1c , glucose blood lipid . If study show benefit either diet , use high fiber , and/or low glycemic index food canola oil , may provide another potential way improve glucose control lower cholesterol level non-insulin dependent diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Glycemic Index Diet ( With Canola Oil ) Type 2 Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall design - Sample size justification : The sample size requirement determine base ability detect HbA1c reduction least 0.4 unit , significance test ( α ) 0.05 , β 2 power ( 1-β ) 0.80 ( The FDA criterion drug effectiveness HbA1c reduction 0.3 0.4 unit ) . Examination recent study result HbA1c research group type 2 diabetic subject indicate standard deviation 0.32 . So desired total number complete study N=80 , 120 enrol assume 30 % attrition rate . - Design : All subject randomize one two 12-week treatment two-treatment parallel design . Treatments : 1 ) low glycemic index dietary advice ( e.g . eat intact grain cereal , Pita Break Finland Rye Little Stream Quinoa bread , parboil rice , crack wheat , pasta , pea , bean , lentil , bake good make legume flour ) , particular emphasis canola oil contain bread ; 2 ) high cereal fiber diet emphasize whole grain . Duration : The study consist approximately two month recruitment patient selection , 3 month treatment period . Study Details : Fasting blood sample obtain screening , week -2 , 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 12 study period glucose , lipid oxidation product . HbA1c assess visit except week 2 . Twenty-four hour urine urinary C-peptide , isoprostane , urea , creatinine electrolyte analysis obtain immediately prior begin study end 12 week treatment . At week 0 ( baseline ) 12 , endothelial function assess . Following 12 week treatment period , subject wish undertake alternate treatment give appropriate instruction . - Setting : Risk Factor Modification Center St. Michael 's Hospital . - Participants/controls ( selection inclusion/exclusion criterion ) : Patient Selection : Healthy non-insulin dependent diabetic men woman recruit newspaper advertisement , physician referral diabetic clinic St. Michael 's Hospital . - Interventions : Diets : Diets subject ' diabetic diet modify . Diet history record week 0 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 10 12 . These diet assess consistency dietitian subject 's presence . Where necessary , modification diet make ensure weight maintenance . - Privacy protection Subjects data de-identified . Any database personal health information password protect . Also , patient data personal health information ( e.g . patient chart ) keep locked cabinet , door lock room cabinet , centre door lock 6 pm . - Confidentiality data All subject assign identification code ensure confidentiality . All data enter file use identification code . Access data file limit PI , statistician , dietitian , student , data entry personnel work project . The data obtain Endo-PAT test send private statistical consultant United States analysis . The dataset de-identified statistical consultant research team access dataset . -Identifiable data Subjects primarily identify code ( number letter ) assign study statistician . A separate chart routine clinical information maintain contact participant ' family physician . DATA ANALYSIS : . Analysis method , include type statistical qualitative method Results express mean ± standard error . The difference treatment mean assess use CONTRAST statement SAS ( Statistical Analysis Software ) use -2 zero blood baseline calculate change week 8 , 10 12 CONTRAST . Pearson 's correlation use assess relationship dietary compliance weight reduction blood lipid change . For Optional Sub-study : In recent diabetes study look effect mixed nut blood sugar control ( REB # 06-274 ) , 44.8 % ( 35/78 ) participant continue onto follow-up 24 % ( 19/78 ) complete follow-up . All cross either muffin ( control ) half dose nut supplement full dose nut ( test ) supplement . In recent Portfolio study ( REB # 04-056 ) , 24 week 62.5 % participant cross DASH diet ( control ) Portfolio diet ( test ) . Assuming study participant also cross control diet test diet , use pair t-test adjustment baseline sequence , true crossover design .</detailed_description>
