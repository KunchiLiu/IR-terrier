	<brief_title>Proprioceptive Function , Postural Stability &amp; Clinical Outcome After Stump Preserving Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) well know knee 's primary stabilizer would compromise ligamentous injury , cause various functional deficit . Currently , ACL reconstruction common management focus restoration stability . Beside joint stabilization , proprioception , define system joint position sense movement , another function ACL also widely study . The proprioceptive function human ACL recognize since 1980 's . The first study describe presence mechanoreceptors human ACL fibre . Study prove ACL extensively innervate neural element . Numerous study report ACL rich mechanoreceptors contribute proprioceptive function . One study 29 ACL remnant report mechanoreceptors include Ruffini , Pacini receptor , Golgi tendon organ-like receptor free nerve ending remnant show number mechanoreceptors significantly relate joint sense accuracy . Another study perform group researcher report somatosensory evoked potential could record ACL remnant electrical stimulation , confirm original sensory neuron preserve certain extent , may help graft neuralization restoration knee function . This echo various study , ACL-deficit knee , loss proprioceptive function report corelation number mechanoreceptors . At result , come idea preserve ACL remnant help maintain facilitate proprioceptive function , operation technique ACL augmentation . ACL augmentation relatively new technique preserve augments ACL remnant use extra graft . Under arthroscopic examination , ACL bundle , anteromedial ( AM ) posterolateral ( PL ) , show partial tear remnant reasonable size , thickness tension , augmentation may perform instead reconstruct whole ligament . Instead remove remain stump , would preserve much possible , formal ACL reconstruction would perform . A commonly use graft single-bundle autogenous semitendinosus gracilis tendon . As retain ACL fiber contains mechanoreceptor responsible proprioception , believe well knee proprioception postural sense could achieve preserve ACL remnant . Also , good vascularization strong mechanical protection expect native ACL fiber retain . The current management partial tear ACL injury mainly conservative treatment surgical treatment , include reconstruction augmentation . For augmentation , common practise perform `` Selective Bundle Reconstruction '' , reconstruct torn bundle , either AM PL reconstruction , preserve remain intact one . The clinical benefit ACL augmentation report several study . A study demonstrate good clinical result International Knee Documentation Commitee ( IKDC ) knee evaluation score , Cincinnati Knee Score KT1000 augmentation use autologous double tripled semitendinosus ( selective AM PL ) reconstruction 1 year post-operatively . An comparison study ACL augmentation ( selective AM PL reconstruction ) reconstruction show superior result knee anterior stability clinical test , KT2000 knee joint position sense augmentation group 2-year follow-up period . This study demonstrate post-operation comparison allogenic fascia lata graft also use control reconstruction group , common graft use ACL surgery local setting . Moreover , assessment perform 2 year post-operatively , immediate early post-operative effect surgical technique still questionable . As mentioned , ACL augmentation may potential clinical advantage include good knee stability , mechanical strength proprioceptive function , yet evidence earlier effect technique still lack , joint position sense demonstrate one study . With relatively new technique 's popularity potential benefit proprioception , deserve research study difference clinical proprioception outcome reconstruction . Therefore , comparative study difference knee proprioception postural stability ACL augmentation reconstruction , include early post-operative assessment perform . In local setting , ACL injury note partially torn pre-operative Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) , surgeon would try preserve remain stump much possible single bundle ACL reconstruction perform intra-operatively . In order make current study result meaningful could generalize local setting , ACL augmentation rename ACL stump-preserving surgery , common practice local setting .</detailed_description>
