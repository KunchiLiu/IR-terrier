	<brief_summary>Canadians fear loss vision disability . Vision loss enormous impact quality-of-life extremely costly societal economic perspective . In 2001 , 600,000 Canadians estimate severe vision loss , account 17 % total disability Canada . One 9 individual experience severe vision loss 65 year age ; however , increase 1 4 individual 75 year . The financial cost vision loss Canada $ 15.8 billion per year . There general perception vision loss `` normal age '' 75 % vision loss estimate preventable . The major cause severe vision loss age-related macular degeneration ( ARMD ) , glaucoma , particularly primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) , diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) . Canada head epidemic age-related eye disease , unless something do prepare , severe vision loss significant consequence term societal economic cost . Through propose Research Program , conjunction investigator international academic private sector partner , investigator build develop unique quantitative imaging technology permit non-invasive assessment visual change , structural change thickness retina back eye also change amount blood flow blood vessel fee retina oxygen . This research add investigator basic knowledge predict development sight-threatening change patient three disease , facilitate earlier detection problem help u discover early treatment people condition . The reliability image technology assess determine ability differentiate diseased healthy eye . Cross-sectional analysis yearly interval , well change time analysis , undertaken .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research add basic knowledge predict development sight-threatening change patient ARMD , diabetic retinopathy primary open glaucoma , facilitate earlier detection problem help u discover early treatment people condition . The reliability image technology assess determine ability differentiate diseased healthy eye . Through propose Research Program , conjunction international academic private sector partner , build develop unique quantitative imaging technology : - Comprehensively assess blood supply , vascular regulation characteristic posterior segment eye , diagnostic capability currently severely limited . - Assess oxygen saturation disturbance retina ON occur prior clinically detectable change , diagnostic capability currently exist - Using retinal blood supply oxygen saturation parameter , derive net oxygen delivery retina optic nerve head ( ONH ) , diagnostic capability exist .</detailed_description>
