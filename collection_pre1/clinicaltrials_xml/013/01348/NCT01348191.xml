	<brief_summary>It recognize many decade high thyrotrophin ( TSH ) level pregnant woman associate poor obstetric outcome . Also , evidence high TSH relate fetal position term , include breech turn associate obstetric complication . However , mechanism behind remains elucidate . The current project basic-fundamental nature . It use well understand basis physiological process . As many study similar basic nature , number always include . If TSH receptor detect , future randomize control trial ( RCT ) might worthwhile large number woman treat thyroxine possibly prevent abnormal fetal position normal pregnancy . The aim current study evaluate whether TSH receptor demonstrate human myometrium . If , pathophysiology high TSH relation obstetric outcome become clear . Furthermore , aim test myometrium vitro relaxation contractility conductance electropotentials .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It recognize many decade high thyrotrophin ( TSH ) level pregnant woman associate poor obstetric outcome . Also , evidence high TSH relate fetal position term , include breech turn associate obstetric complication . However , mechanism behind remains elucidate . It show high TSH affect relaxation contraction smooth muscle large blood vessel human . In animal , evidence TSH interfere uterine contractility . Although TSH receptor demonstrate outside thyroid bone , brain heart , far research possible TSH receptor human uterine tissue publish . The current study pilot study limit number participant ( pregnant woman , n=10 ) elective Caesarean section uterine specimen collect analysis immune-laboratory . Another part specimen analyse technical laboratory ( Technical University Eindhoven ) analyse relaxation contractility myometrium study conductance electropotentials .</detailed_description>
