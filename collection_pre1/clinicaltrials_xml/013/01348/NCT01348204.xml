	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop new biomarkers study cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Defects gene encode Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator ( CFTR ) cause CF , autosomal recessive disorder affect mainly pulmonary digestive tract , lead early death largely due progressive loss pulmonary function . In vitro experiment show quercetin - dietary supplement well-established safety profile human use , include clinical trial variety disorder encompass cancer , heart disease , anti-inflammatory agent - induces activation CFTR . The nasal potential difference ( NPD ) test measurement voltage across nasal membrane fundamental biomarker CFTR activity vivo . The NPD useful , well-established tool CF research determine diagnose well measure effect new therapy . In vitro experiment show quercetin induces activation CFTR additive see current NPD reagent . In addition , activate rescue mutant CFTR vitro ( ∆F508 CFTR common cause CF ) , whereas conventional agonist . Preliminary vivo experiment mirror result show quercetin activates CFTR human ( n=12 ) NPD test . Importantly , quercetin perfusion well-tolerated validated sinus questionnaire physician assess nasal examination rating . These study provide strong support use quercetin potentiator CFTR Cl- channel function nasal administration . By add quercetin sequence perfusion solution NPD , investigator may well suit detect ∆F508 CFTR activity rescue mutant protein CF patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Flavonoids large group naturally occur polyphenolic compound ubiquitous throughout plant kingdom bio-available fruit , vegetable , nut , seed , flower , bark . Quercetin raise particular interest major component naturally occur dietary flavonols , also seem anti-oxidant , anti-carcinogenic , anti-inflammatory , well cardioprotective function . Recently , laboratory others report quercetin , addition function , play role improve function chloride ( Cl- ) transport ( CFTR ) . It well establish genistein , flavone related quercetin , increase mutant wild-type CFTR channel activity . Genistein widely use various cell system , tissue , specie robust CFTR activator . Although extremely helpful laboratory experiment , Genistein translate poorly human experiment poor dissolution solvent . As almost flavonoid activate CFTR , deep examination member family important clinical use well tool future clinical study . Quercetin available health food store dietary supplement pill well beverage form . It may also beneficial treatment CF use direct activator CFTR use clinical trial measurement CFTR activity important . Through good understanding CFTR biogenesis activation , new therapeutic approach restore activity mutant CFTR molecules vitro vivo develop . Biomarkers detect activity rescue CFTR required measure therapeutic effect new compound . Current method yet show consistent rescue CFTR activity , raise importance optimize detection strategy , include effective NPD endpoint . This may particularly important subject harbor ∆F508 mutation addition cell processing abnormality , also exhibit channel gate defect ( activate conventional NPD agonist isoproterenol ) thereby reduce detection rescue protein . The investigator previous experience evaluate alternative CFTR activate agent , CF animal model , human subject . By add quercetin sequence perfusion solution NPD , investigator may well suit detect CFTR activity rescue mutant protein . In vitro experiment show quercetin induces activation CFTR additive see current NPD reagent . Preliminary vivo experiment non-CF individual mirror result show quercetin activates CFTR human NPD test ( n=12 ) . Importantly , quercetin perfusion well-tolerated validated sinus questionnaire physician assess nasal examination rating . As preliminary data suggest perfusion quercetin may improve defective CFTR activation surface localize ΔF508 , use agent within NPD protocol likely improve detection ΔF508 CFTR resident cell surface , represent potential mean identify new candidate systemic CFTR potentiator therapy .</detailed_description>
