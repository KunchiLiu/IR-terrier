	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether oral sodium nitrate administration prior coronary artery bypass surgery reduce perioperative level troponin T. In addition , plasma urine surrogate marker renal , hepatic brain injury monitor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Coronary Artery Bypass Nitrate Oral Supplementation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide ( NO ) important mediator cardiovascular system show protective property ischemia-reperfusion injury . Inorganic nitrate , oxidation product endogenous NO production also constituent green leafy vegetable , recycle , via nitrite , back bioactive NO body . Recent research show beneficial effect nitrate nitrite animal model myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury . Moreover , dietary nitrate reduces blood pressure oxygen cost exercise human . During coronary bypass surgery heart undergo ischemia-reperfusion injury troponin T often release myocardium . The aim present study investigate preoperative inorganic nitrate , dose easily achievable diet , affect troponin T release well surrogate marker injury liver , kidney brain . In addition , plasma urine sample collect marker oxidative stress inflammation ( sCRP cytokine ) . Patients plan bypass surgery give write informed consent , night surgery , get standardize , low-nitrate meal receive sodium nitrate two occasion preoperatively ; night morning surgery . Plasma urine sample collect various time point 72 hour surgery .</detailed_description>
