	<brief_summary>Specialised palliative care ( SPC ) seek relieve suffer improve quality life patient life threaten disease advance cancer . Many patient advance cancer contact SPC . Previous study show among advanced cancer patient refer SPC significant prevalence symptom , problem need . The aims present study investigate whether patient metastatic cancer , report palliative need screen , benefit refer SPC investigate economical consequence referral .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Investigating Effect Specialised Palliative Care Symptoms , Survival , Economical Factors Satisfaction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial randomise , clinical , multicenter trial include 6 Danish SPC-centres . The basic principle patient palliative need ( see inclusion criterion ) identify oncological department randomise either ( ) standard treatment plus SPC ( intervention group ) ( ii ) standard treatment ( control group ) . Patients identify following procedure : A ) Each week research nurse review medical record consecutive patient see oncological out-patients clinic . B ) Eligible patient ask fill questionnaire ( screen ) investigate symptoms problem . The patient tell questionnaire evaluate research nurse contact patient late information RCT . C ) Those patient report least one palliative need questionnaire ( see inclusion criterion ) four additional symptom contact research nurse provide patient write verbal information RCT . D ) Patients give inform consent randomise . Detailed statistical analysis plan : Analysis primary outcome The primary outcome analysis modify ITT analysis . Patients withdraw consent randomisation , randomise mistake fulfil inclusion criterion , alive time follow-up , exclude primary analysis . All exclusion show CONSORT flow-chart patient participation . In primary outcome analysis use multiple imputation non-responders 5 % miss outcome . In total , make 20 different data-sets imputation base regression model use predictive-mean-matching use MI MI ANALYSIS procedures SAS . The primary outcome analysis make multiple regression adjust stratification variable normally distribute . Sensitivity analyse primary outcome We make five sensitivity analysis : 1 ) fully adjust analysis include relevant covariates , 2 ) complete case analysis , 3 ) analysis include model repeat measurement , 4 ) per protocol analysis , 5 ) analysis include imputation die . Analysis secondary outcomes The analysis seven scale EORTC QLQ-C30 ( physical function , role function , emotional function , nausea vomiting , pain , dyspnoea , lack appetite ) make use principle describe primary outcome include sensitivity analysis . Survival analyse use Kaplan-Meier plot . Patients alive three month end data-collection censured date . A Cox regression make adjust stratification variable . A sensitivity analysis make adjust relevant covariates . Exploratory outcomes subgroup analysis For serious adverse event report number hospitalisation , number acute hospitalisation number death eight week trial period . The analysis exploratory outcome dealt detail . The overall principle regard questionnaire data ( remain scale EORTC QLQ-C30 , HADS FAMCARE-P16 ) analyse complete case analysis . Significance level All test two-tailed . For primary outcome risk type I error set 5 % ( i.e. , significance level P &lt; 0.05 ) . As 8 secondary outcome , adjust significance level P &lt; 0.01 control familywise ( cumulative ) type I error due multiplicity . The P-values exploratory outcome provide , make clear analysis exploratory . Register-data , data-management analysis Survival retrieve Danish Civil Registration System ( CPR ) , serious adverse event contact The Danish Patient Registry ( Landspatientregistret ) . Data management do project manager Anna Thit Johnsen . Analyses make statistician Morten Aa . Petersen , blind identity two intervention group , denote Y X . Results present blinded way investigator , conclusion regard result drawn investigator write intervention still blind . The blind broken analysis primary secondary outcome conduct .</detailed_description>
