	<brief_summary>Pain problem many Canadians . Unfortunately , many doctor , nurse , therapist , psychologist trouble keep date apply late research might help patient suffer pain . This study determine whether send alert new pain research directly health professional , provide access accumulate alert , help . The study compare knowledge decision make health professional manage pain problem . The investigator compare physician , nurse , rehab therapist psychologists begin study access different way find new pain research . One group receive alert new pain study find high quality relevant patient care , able search alert database . The group able find study , must go database research study locate . The investigator include 670 doctor , nurse , rehab therapist , psychologist study . A process like toss coin determine way able get pain research information . The investigator monitor much information access apply manage pain problem . The investigator expect remind health care providers new research finding directly help , since difficulty find study lack time prevent use late research . The investigator expect reminder late research help make good decision care patient ' pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Comparing `` Push '' Versus `` Pull '' Technology Mobilizing Pain Evidence Into Practice Across Different Health Professions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Problem : Pain affect Canadians acute injury disease . Chronic noncancer pain affect 29 % Canadians , half unable participate usual work/social role . Pain primary reason patient consult health practitioner . Research show benefit , harm , cost numerous intervention pain , uptake knowledge far satisfactory . Optimizing pain care require ready access use best evidence within across different discipline setting . The Research Question : The purpose randomize trial determine whether technology-based `` push '' new , high-quality pain research physician , nurse , rehabilitation psychology professional result well knowledge clinical decision-making around pain , offer addition traditional `` pull '' evidence technology . A secondary objective identify disciplinary variation response evidence difference pattern access research evidence . The Study Sample : 670 Physicians , nurse , occupational/physical therapist psychologist ( ( 80/group X 2 comparison group X 4 discipline ) + 30 dropout ) recruit professional association , websites/conferences social medium . This provide &gt; 90 % power detect main effect ; 80 % power subgroup effect . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome uptake application evidence . Uptake determine embed track research access use intervention . A random subset 30 participants/discipline undergo chart-stimulated recall ( CSR ) ass nature depth evidence utilization actual case management ( 0 , 9 month ) . A different random subset 30 participants/discipline test skill access evidence use standardized simulation test ( final 3 month ) . Secondary outcome include usage self-reported evidence-based practice attitude behaviours ( 0 , 3 , 9 , 15 , 18 month ) . Intervention/Methods : Participants agree study free literature service randomly allocate Push + Pull versus Pull evidence support . Push + Pull evidence pain extract medical , nursing rehabilitation journal appraise quality relevance send clinician ( derive successful MacPLUS/Evidence Updates ) , deliver e-mail alert available search accumulate database ) . Pull intervention similar front-face require clinician go site extract evidence electronic database . The trial begin 3-month ( repeat ) baseline , average participant use standard PULL resource monitor . Participants randomly allocate receive PUSH + PULL continue use PULL resource . After six month , participant cross alternate intervention additional six month . To complete trial , group finish three month PUSH + PULL access . Analyses : The investigator use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) , discipline set covariates assess differential response across main effect Push + Pull v . Pull . Content analysis CSR interview use describe application evidence within actual case . Impact/Timeliness : The trial inform understand information preference behaviours across disciplines/practice setting . If intervention effective , sustain support come professional/health system initiatives emerge optimize pain management Canada .</detailed_description>
