	<brief_title>The Relationship Between Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Chitinase 3-like 1 Gene , YKL-40 Serum Levels Adult Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chitinase 3-like 1 ( CHI3L1 ) member human chitinases family . According previous study literatures , increased expression CHI3L1 proven correlate presence different disease , include cancer , autoimmune disease , chronic inflammatory condition . Elevated serum level YKL-40 associate increased disease severity , poor prognosis short survival many disease . When monitored time , increase serum YKL-40 parallel disease progression . It serve measurable marker change disease status . There indicated chitinase 3-like 1 might associate clinical disease . The C-allele -131 Câ†’G ( rs4950928 ) polymorphism CHI3L1 show associate bronchial hyperresponsiveness reduce lung function . It suggest variation CHI3L1 may influence risk asthma . The objective study investigate relationship single nucleotide polymorphism chitinase 3-like 1 human asthma . The association CHI3L1 SNPs continuous outcome examine real time PCR gene sequence analysis . In Korean report significant association CHI3L1 SNPs asthma observe . On hand , association CHI3L1 asthma observe majority Caucasian population . However , similar research conduct Taiwan . In contrast preliminary study , investigator predict rs4950928 G allele , C allele , find associate asthma . The g.-247C/T polymorphism CHI3L1 promoter region associate risk atopy .</detailed_description>
