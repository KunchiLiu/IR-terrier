	<brief_title>Delanzomib ( CEP-18770 ) Combination With Lenalidomide Dexamethasone Relapsed Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After cycle 1 , start treatment cycle may occur within 3-day window . In addition , cycle 2 , start treatment cycle 3 may delay 1 week , opinion investigator , delay warrant . If patient receive 75 % plan dose 3 agent ( miss 1 dose CEP-18770 , 5 dos lenalidomide [ either consecutively separately ] , 1 dose dexamethasone [ either consecutively separately ] ) , due drug-related adverse event , event consider dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , even grade toxicity lower specify DLT determination . Patients receive intravenous ( IV ) CEP-18770 day 1 , 8 , 15 , oral lenalidomide day 1 21 , oral dexamethasone day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle . Treatment 3 drug continue 12 cycle ( approximately 11 month ) , disease progression intolerable toxicity . Patients experience clinical benefit may continue receive additional treatment investigator 's discretion follow sponsor notification . In part 2 study , patient receive CEP-18770 slow IV bolus ( approximately 1 milliliter per minute ) maximum tolerate dose day 1 , 8 , 15 every 28-day cycle . Patients complete discontinue study drug treatment whose disease progress study visit every 7-9 week follow-up disease progression , death , monitor 1 year first administration study drug , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
