	<detailed_description>Axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) previously standard axillary staging procedure breast cancer patient . However , ALND accompany considerable morbidity , include seroma formation , lymphedema , neuropathy arm numbness , stiffness , impaired shoulder movement pain . Sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) evolve mean decrease morbidity , validation study demonstrate accuracy method . With intent study axillary recurrence negative SLNB patient completion ALND omit , consecutive breast cancer patient include Swedish Sentinel Node Multicenter Cohort Study September 2000 January 2004 . Patients unifocal , invasive breast cancer le 3 cm diameter eligible enrollment . Exclusion criterion palpable regional lymph node , neoadjuvant chemo- radiotherapy , pregnancy , know allergic reaction blue dye isotope , previous surgery ipsilateral breast , preoperatively diagnosed tumor multifocality . Surgical procedure : After preoperative injection 40-60 mBq Technetium-99 nanocolloid ( Solco Nanocoll® ) 1 ml blue dye ( Patent Blue V® ) , sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) biopsy perform . If sentinel node could identify , ALND level I II perform . A completion ALND also perform event positive SLN biopsy , lymph node clearly suspicious metastasis detect surgery , primary tumor breast find multifocal pathological examination . Pathological assessment : Frozen section obtain SLN examine peroperatively . If sentinel lymph node small 4 mm , two section analyze separately . Nodes large 4 mm bisect , two section half analyze . According study protocol , least three section prepare sentinel node part bisect node definitive histopathology . Sections stain haematoxylin eosin ( HE ) . If cancer cell detect , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) cytokeratin antibody also perform . Non-sentinel lymph node examine routine staining ( HE ) accord protocol pathology department . Treatment follow-up : Adjuvant treatment combination give accord national regional treatment guideline , base tumor characteristic , lymph node status , surgical treatment . Patients isolated tumor cell regard lymph node-negative . If breast-conserving surgery perform , radiation therapy breast give , extend include regional lymph node case axillary lymph node metastasis . Chemotherapy offer patient lymph node metastasis combination unfavorable primary tumor characteristic ( large tumor , high Elston score , progesterone receptor negativity ) , consideration general health . Endocrine therapy offer patient estrogen progesterone receptor-positive tumor large 10 mm . The actual report adjuvant treatment control analysis . Patients follow prospectively . The research protocol postulate annual follow-up mammography clinical examination . After enrollment , data sheet , include information primary tumor characteristic , number sentinel non-sentinel lymph node without metastasis , give adjuvant treatment , computerize . The study approve ethic committee Karolinska Institutet , Stockholm , region 's local ethic committee . All patient give write informed consent .</detailed_description>
