	<brief_title>Study Safety Efficacy Nitric Oxide Gel Subjects With Pressure Sore</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pressure sore common problem patient bed-ridden . The care pressure sore cost many social medical resource , also effect quality life patient . Current principle treatment pressure sore include adequate pain control , optimize nutritional status , pressure relief , wound clean dressing , infection control surgical intervention need . Wound dressing base wound characteristic . However , improve wound healing , different dress material develop . There increased evidence implicate nitric oxide ( NO ) synthesis play important role process wound heal . Nitric oxide involve angiogenesis , mediate inflammatory process , cell proliferation collagen disposition , improve wound healing . One study use topic NO-gel mouse second degree burn wound , find NO gel potential enhance burn wound heal regulation many cellular process skin . Based finding , investigator hypothesize NO gel could use alternative method pressure sore dress enhance wound healing . This 12-week study . The investigator plan enroll 40 subject . The run-in period set screen base inclusion exclusion criterion . Baseline data include demographic profile , medical history current medication obtain , follow intact pressure sore inspection . Pressure ulcer stage ( developed NPAUP ) , Pressure Ulcer Scale Healing ( PUSH ) Pressure Sore Status Tool ( PSST ) record randomization . Baseline photograph pressure sore take . During treatment phase , NO gel placebo gel administer pressure sore wound caregiver twice daily ( decide doctor accord clinical condition ) standard wound clean normal saline . During treatment period , study subject followed- every 2 week record wound condition side effect . The investigator use stage , PUSH PSST , take serial photograph monitor wound condition .</detailed_description>
