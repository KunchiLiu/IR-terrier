	<brief_summary>Background purpose : In early phase total knee replacement ( TKA ) , patient experience decrease leg muscle strength 80 % . This considerable loss muscle strength relate reduced functional performance point time . As loss muscle strength functional performance pronounce early TKA , rehabilitation include strength training initiate early TKA seem logical choice . However , tradition fear symptom exacerbation , increase knee joint swelling , knee pain slow recovery knee joint range motion , typically precluded strength train early TKA . Hypothesis : Our hypothesis effect early rehabilitation include strength training great rehabilitation without strength training . If hypothesis confirm , strength train early TKA could implement directly clinical rehabilitation practice . Participants method : Seventy participant unilateral TKA , age 18 80 year , understand speak Danish , give informed consent , include study.The study single-blinded randomize control study , participant receive supervise 1 ) rehabilitation 2 ) rehabilitation without strength train 7 week . All component rehabilitation program ( balance- , mobility training etc . ) group except strength training exercise . Instead strength training exercise , group without strength train spend time warm-up exercise , mobility- balance exercise . The rehabilitation program last 1 hour per session , perform twice per week . The participant perform test battery 4 time 6 month TKA . The test battery assess participant ' walk ability , leg strength , knee pain , knee joint swelling- range motion , self-reported function quality life . Ethical issue : From pilot study conduct begin 2010 , investigator find , strength training initiate early TKA seem feasible , increase knee joint swell knee pain . None financial supporter , author , potential conflict interest regard study .</brief_summary>
