	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give lenalidomide together vaccine therapy work treat patient early-stage asymptomatic chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . Lenalidomide may stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . It may also stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill cancer cell . Giving lenalidomide together vaccine therapy may make strong immune response kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Early-Stage Asymptomatic Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion early-stage , high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) patient achieve response ( &gt; = 4-fold increase baseline and/or antibody concentration &gt; = 0.35 ug/mL 6 7 type-specific anti-pneumococcal antibody level ) 2 dos pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine ( Prevnar 13 , PCV13 [ pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine ] ) administer concurrent versus sequential low-dose lenalidomide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine complete response ( CR ) rate 2 year lenalidomide therapy . II . To determine time first treatment ( TFT ) , define time diagnosis first non-lenalidomide therapy progressive CLL describe International Workshop Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( IWCLL ) 2008 criterion . III . To determine incidence infection invasive pneumococcal infection follow treatment PCV13 vaccine either concurrent sequential lenalidomide . IV . To determine frequency humoral cellular immune response CLL tumor antigens follow treatment PCV13 vaccine either concurrent sequential lenalidomide . V. To determine safety toxicity associate long-term lenalidomide exposure . VI . To perform correlative pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic study correlate vaccine/tumor immunologic disease response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( concurrent PCV13 ) : Patients receive low-dose lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive 13-valent protein-conjugated pneumococcal vaccine ( PCV13 ) intramuscularly ( IM ) day 78 134 ( course 3 5 ) . ARM II ( sequential PCV13 ) : Patients receive PCV13 IM day 1 78 ( course 1 3 ) . Patients also receive low-dose lenalidomide arm 1 begin day 106 ( course 4 ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
