	<brief_summary>Type II diabetes important condition UK prevalence 3.54 % affect approximately 2.5 million people across country . Diabetics fivefold increase risk cardiovascular disease 65 % diabetic die coronary heart disease stroke . Exercise one management tool along medication weight reduction available improve diabetic control reduce morbidity mortality . Exercise promotion might effective population level could incorporate simple form part pre-existing routine care . This case control study seek assess effectiveness write exercise advice give Type II diabetic time annual review . The study open Type II diabetic single general practice attend routine nurse lead annual review . The intervention use leaflet prepared part previous study Time2Act study assessment self-reported questionnaire . Follow 12 month study design allow long duration . Previous study demonstrate effectiveness exercise intervention often hospital-based used exercise interview main intervention rather incorporate exercise advice structure already establish routine Primary Care . If study demonstrate simple intervention carry part routine care positive effect low level disseminate knowledge across country would bring significant benefit Type II diabetic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objectives The objective study evaluate whether incorporate simple low-cost , low resource intervention routine diabetic care General Practice effective produce sustained change activity level across significant number patient . Even change activity level small individual patient level widespread across practice 's diabetic population intervention value . The primary outcome measure use validate self report questionnaire ( SPAQ-Scottish Physical Activity Questionnaire ) measure change amount exercise undertaken . During routine diabetic care wide range information record clinical system part satisfy QoF ( Quality Outcomes Framework ) requirement possible analyse dataset parameter age , sex social class well see whether change blood pressure , weight , lipid profile HbA1C ( glycosylated haemoglobin- measure medium term diabetic control ) . The intervention simple effective could form part routine ongoing care Type II Diabetics . If extend longer period might possible extract data relate intervention illness death rate . The delivery intervention , know Health Care Professional familiar setting , interview patient 's expectation receive advice hopefully therefore receptive advice , regular reinforcement part routine care may mean initial intervention straight forward . This study seek answer question deliberately choose write information unsuccessful arm previous study ~ Time2Act study . The original study design record baseline activity level target population appropriate assessment tool , carry intervention record change activity level biometric biochemical parameter interval . This could consider audit part 'normal care ' therefore investigator might argue formal patient consent require . However follow discussion team Queen Mary 's University London ( QMUL ) would weaken study would difficult assess effect confound factor . The presence control group would make study valid . A randomized control trial ( RCT ) would ideal design constraint time outcome measure questionnaire would require large practical study long duration . A Case Control study therefore choose act pilot follow work . Inclusion Exclusion Criteria All Type II diabetic 18 attend Diabetic Annual Review ( DAR ) eligible include research . The DAR offer 3 12 month initial diagnosis . This exclude newly diagnose diabetic might undergo DESMOND course . Type II diabetic 18 follow paediatric team would normally call review practice . Other exclusion criterion relate condition patient either unable understand advice give physically unable follow . Patients dementia physically able participate exclude long consent obtain next kin legal representative . Input General Practitioner ( GP ) surgery valuable . Consent Written consent seek participant . Consent obtain site investigator Dr J D Hill follow write invitation . They opportunity individual discuss study face face Dr Hill register GP . The GPs information study write well discuss Practice meeting . The benefit activity available diabetic important patient limit understand exclude . Consent would therefore sought responsible carer e.g . someone hold power attorney similar instrument . Pre-notification list pass registered GP prior invitation send allow exclude inappropriate patient e.g . terminally ill . The main researcher experience assess capacity full time work General Practitioner . Risks , Burdens Benefits To degree risk participant arm study . The intervention group encourage increase activity level could construe risk injury unaccustomed exertion ( e.g . muscle ache ) may reveal underlie undiagnosed pathology ( e.g . angina ) . The advice leaflet carefully design provide grade increase activity minimize risk participant opportunity study base surgery seek advice regard unexpected symptom . For duration study control group receive 'normal care ' respect include general advice increase activity access information Diabetes UK . They may perceive low level care . Both group increase contact surgery study organize way minimize intrusion . The benefit expect two phase . Initially intervention group see positive health return increase activity roll part normal care across whole patient population . Confidentiality Data handling within surgery subject tight control overseen nominate Caldicott guardian practice compliant regulation attach IMT DES ( Information Technology Direct Enhanced Service ) regulate West Sussex PCT . Information hold secure Clinical System . Staff handle patient information access data part normal duty subject NHS code confidentiality . For statistical analysis site patient surgery number ( NHS number ) use identifier . The way trace back individual would access password protect Surgery system . Information come light study indicate serious risk feed back main investigator thence register GP . Investigator General Practitioner During study period patient contact take place may clinically appropriate encourage exercise study participant . One 's primary responsibility patient care independent study advice withhold write information give organization Diabetes UK study leaflet . Normal care therefore maintain . At end study future practice guide result .</detailed_description>
