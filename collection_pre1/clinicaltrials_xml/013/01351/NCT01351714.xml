	<brief_summary>When perform resection right colon due cancer one aim remove tumor bear bowel segment , also lymph node drain affected area . These lymph node locate along artery supply right colon . Through use preoperative CT scan map artery precisely one ligate vessel closer origin thus remove lymph node may potentially harbor cancer cell . This study aim compare patient operate radically use preoperative CT map mention artery patient operated standard way .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safe D3 Right Hemicolectomy Cancer Through Multidetector Computed Tomography ( MDCT ) Angio</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Norwegian gastrointestinal cancer group recommend D3 resection standard operative technique colon cancer . D3 resection implies ligation blood vessel origin . There evidence recurrence free period survival improve number lymph node harvest surgery . However , current practice Norway , perform right hemicolectomy cancer ligate feeding vessel right colon right hand side superior mesenteric vein ( SMV ) . Significant arterial stump demonstrate patient operate right colon cancer technique ( right colic artery ileocolic artery vascular stumps average length 3.5 cm 2.5 cm , respectively ) . This leave reason believe certain number central lymph node remain procedure . The complex anatomical relationship right colic artery ileocolic artery superior mesenteric vein make D3 resection demanding , especially right colic artery lie posterior SMV . These relationship investigate detail postmortem anatomical study . These study show right colic artery lie often anterior SMV , ileocolic artery lie often posterior SMV . Data also provide CT angiography verify relation well postmortem anatomical study live patient , thus allow surgeon aware prior surgery . This could prove crucial planning procedure .</detailed_description>
