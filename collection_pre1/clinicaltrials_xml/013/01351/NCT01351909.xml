	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose cyclophosphamide veliparib give together treat patient breast cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving cyclophosphamide together veliparib may work well treat breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose veliparib ( ABT-888 ) combine metronomic dose cyclophosphamide patient metastatic breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether macroH2A1.1 poly ( adenosine diphosphate [ ADP ] -ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP1 ) expression status archival paraffin embed tumor specimen either primary tumor metastatic disease predictive clinical benefit veliparib ( ABT-888 ) plus cyclophosphamide . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) cyclophosphamide PO QD day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
