	<brief_summary>ACTG A5275 prospective , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled cross-over design pilot study evaluate effect atorvastatin biomarkers inflammation , coagulopathy , angiogenesis , T-lymphocyte activation HIV-1 infected individual suppress HIV-1 RNA stable protease inhibitor base antiretroviral therapy fast LDL cholesterol &lt; 130 mg/dL . Atorvastatin drug approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat high cholesterol . Atorvastatin also able low level inflammation blood test certain disease study purpose people HIV . The main goal experimental study see take atorvastatin affect inflammation blood test people infect HIV need take medicine high cholesterol . In addition observe effect atorvastatin level inflammation measure blood , study evaluate atorvastatin safe people HIV also take medication HIV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since people start take HIV medication , illness AIDS decrease , serious disease like heart disease ( heart attack ) certain kind cancer increase . HIV cause inflammation ( irritation ) inside body felt measured level certain inflammation blood test . Inflammation may contribute disease ( heart attack ) become leading cause death people HIV . HIV therapy partially low level inflammation measure blood , however , level inflammation people HIV take certain kind anti-HIV drug may remain high compare found people infected HIV .</detailed_description>
