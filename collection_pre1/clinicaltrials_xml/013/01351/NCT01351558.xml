	<brief_summary>There ample evidence exercise therapy beneficial respect pain patient osteoarthritis knee . However , pain relieve mechanism unknown . To enhance efficacy exercise therapy deeper understand involve mechanism need . Different exercise type may affect pain sensitivity differently . It hypothesize non-specific exercise ( i.e . exercise involve knee ) reduce process pain central nervous system ( central sensitivity ) knee joint pain healthy subject . It also hypothesize exercise involve knee ( i.e . specific knee exercise ) reduce sensitivity pain receptor knee ( peripheral sensitivity ) healthy subject . Healthy volunteer recruit randomise one four intervention : 1 : Muscle strengthen exercise involve thigh muscle ; 2 : Muscle strengthen exercise involve shoulder muscle ; 3 : Cardio-vascular fitness exercise ; 4 : Control ( exercise ) . The active intervention include exercise three time per week 12 week . Pain sensitivity range explanatory variable measure intervention , 4 week 12 week .</brief_summary>
