	<brief_summary>The purpose study test new drug call carfilzomib . It type drug call proteasome inhibitor . Proteasome breaks protein longer useful cell . When proteasome turn drug ( like carfilzomib ) , useless protein break . Instead proteins build cause cell die . Myeloma cell make lot protein especially need functional proteasome survive . Carfilzomib approve use Food Drug Administration treat myeloma . It consider experimental drug . Previous study show carfilzomib safe use . This study look effect , good and/or bad , carfilzomib myeloma .</brief_summary>
