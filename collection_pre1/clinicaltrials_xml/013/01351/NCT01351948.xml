	<brief_summary>This study aim compare safety immunogenicity AdCh63 AMA1 MVA AMA1vaccine candidate administer alone adjuvant various schedule . These vaccine consist inactivated virus modify , reproduce human , also include genetic material malaria protein AMA1 express malaria parasite blood stage infection . The vaccine design stimulate immune response malaria protein thus provide protection malaria infection . Adjuvants crucial component modern vaccine regimen , increase immunogenicity potency protein vaccine . In study ass whether virus vectored vaccine combine protein adjuvant AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® CPG 7909 adjuvant ( emulsion contain TLR agonist ) induce strong durable immune response .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy adult age 18 50 year Able willing ( Investigator 's opinion ) comply study requirement Willing allow investigator discuss volunteer 's medical history General Practitioner Women : Must practice continuous effective contraception duration study . Men : Must use barrier contraception day vaccination CPG 7909 , 3 month . Agreement refrain blood donation course study 6 month end involvement study . Written informed consent History clinical P. falciparum malaria Travel malaria endemic region study period within precede six month significant risk malaria exposure . Participation another research study involve investigational product 30 day precede enrolment , plan use study period . Prior receipt investigational malaria vaccine investigational vaccine likely impact interpretation trial data . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within three month precede plan administration vaccine candidate . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient state , include HIV infection ; asplenia ; recurrent , severe infection chronic ( 14 day ) immunosuppressant medication within past 6 month ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) Pregnancy , lactation intention become pregnant study History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine e.g . egg product , Kathon . History clinically significant contact dermatitis . History know allergy nickel ( volunteer may enrol group 5 allergy nickel ) Any history anaphylaxis post vaccination . History cancer ( except basal cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) . History serious psychiatric condition may affect participation study . Any serious chronic illness require hospital specialist supervision . Suspected known current alcohol abuse define alcohol intake great 42 unit every week . Suspected known inject drug abuse 5 year precede enrolment . Seropositive hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . Seropositive hepatitis C virus ( antibody HCV ) . History evidence preexist autoimmune antibody mediate disease laboratory evidence possible autoimmune disease , define antidsDNA ≥ 25 IU/mL positive antinuclear antibody ( ANA ) result screen . Any clinically significant abnormal find biochemistry haematology blood test , urinalysis clinical examination . Any significant disease , disorder finding may significantly increase risk volunteer participation study , affect ability volunteer participate study impair interpretation study data .</criteria>
