	<brief_summary>A drug-drug interaction anti-HIV drug tenofovir DF ( TDF ) atazanavir ( ATZ ) result low ATZ plasma level drug give together , particularly patient take ritonavir boost ATZ level . Lower plasma drug level may make anti-HIV regimen less effective control HIV virus level blood . For reason , current treatment guideline recommend ATZ always boost ritonavir regimen also contain TDF . However , withdrawal ritonavir often desirable give tolerability toxicity issue agent , even low dose ( 100 mg daily ) use boost ATZ . For example , ritonavir cause stomach upset , nausea , diarrhea , high cholesterol level , liver enzyme abnormality . However , evidence plasma ATZ level may predict treatment success unboosted ATZ regimen , particularly among people whose plasma HIV virus already control unboosted ATZ use maintenance strategy . In BC Centre Excellence HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program ( DTP ) , nearly 100 patient originally treat ritonavir-boosted ATZ + TDF ( + FTC 3TC ) receive successful maintenance therapy unboosted ATZ TDF-based backbone . The study examine hypothesis switch maintenance therapy unboosted ATZ 400mg daily similar 48-week virologic efficacy continue ATZ/ritonavir 300/100mg daily among HIV-infected adult stable viral load suppression regimens comprise ATZ/ritonavir 300/100mg daily TDF plus either FTC 3TC , despite potentially low ATZ trough level unboosted regimen . In word , patient whose HIV viral load undetectable receive TDF ( +FTC 3TC ) ATZ/ritonavir continue maintain undetectable viral load switch unboosted ATZ without ritonavir , proportion continue boost ATZ/ritonavir regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Switch Unboosted Atazanavir With Tenofovir Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following screen visit establish study eligibility , eligible consent subject randomize 1:1 one two treatment arm ( switch unboosted ATZ continue ritonavir-boosted ATZ ) . Randomized open-label treatment commence follow study procedure baseline . Participants assess baseline week 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 . On-study evaluation include assessment adverse clinical event medication change ; blood test HIV viral load , CD4 cell count , standard safety parameter , fast lipid glucose , pregnancy test ( applicable ) ; urine test urinalysis albumin creatinine ratio . In addition , serum sample store visit possible future test . A timed plasma sample measurement pre-dose trough ATZ level obtain per subject 4-8 week . Quality life assess completion MOS-HIV questionnaire baseline every 12 week . Adherence assess base prescription refill data . In case protocol-defined virologic failure , plasma sample ATZ trough level collect , genotypic resistance test perform plasma sample viral load &gt; 250 copies/mL . Subjects confirm virologic failure ask come clinic HIV treatment change effective regimen , select base result genotypic test , soon possible . The anticipated rate confirm virologic failure control arm 15 % 48 week study . Once least 20 subject assign experimental ( switch ) treatment arm , observe confirm virologic failure rate experimental arm great twice rate , i.e . &gt; 30 % , time study , study stop . At time , subject experimental arm reassess soon possible resume ritonavir-boosted atazanavir effective HIV therapy appropriate . The failure rate reassess minimum 20 subject enrol experimental ( switch ) arm .</detailed_description>

Clinically significant intolerance toxicity current regimen preclude regimen continuation ( e.g . intolerance/toxicity ritonavir necessitate ritonavir discontinuation ) 2. pregnancy breastfeed 3. antiretroviral regimen include nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( nevirapine , efavirenz , etravirine ) 4. antiretroviral regimen include protease inhibitor atazanavir ritonavir 5. concomitant treatment proton pump inhibitor , rifampin , St. John 's wort , garlic supplement . ( Antacids H2 receptor antagonist allow provided dosing separate atazanavir administration least 2 10 hour , respectively ) .</criteria>
