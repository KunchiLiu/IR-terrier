The investigator believe CDSS potential address barrier cite previous study obstacles specific implementation developmental surveillance screen within primary care practice . CDSS allow developmental surveillance screening fit within workflow busy pediatric practice without require additional investment time part physician without require additional office staff . The aim study ( 1 ) Expand modify exist computer-based decision support system ( CHICA ) include 2006 AAP developmental surveillance screen algorithm ; ( 2 ) Evaluate effect CHICA system developmental surveillance screening practice four pediatric clinic ; ( 3 ) Evaluate effect CHICA system referral developmental medical evaluation well early developmental intervention/early childhood service child identify concern developmental screening result ; ( 4 ) Develop cohort child identify developmental disability follow time order look end results/effects developmental screening</brief_summary>
