	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Versus Hepatic Resection Treatment Hepatocellular Carcinomas Smaller Than 2 cm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With development medical science , patient diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) early stage ( single ≤ 5 cm diameter ≤ 3 nodule , ≤ 3 cm diameter ) allow radical treatment hepatic resection ( HR ) , liver transplantation , percutaneous ablation . Liver transplantation eliminate tumor cirrhosis time , consider appropriate treatment patient . However , lack liver donor major limitation . Until , HR still consider first-choice treatment patient , may offer 5-year survival rate 50 % . Percutaneous ablation , include percutaneous ethanol injection ( PEI ) percutaneous radiofrequency ablation ( PRFA ) , usually consider second-choice treatment small HCC unresectable due impair liver function , liver transplantation indicate . Recently , clinical trial show PRFA effective HR small HCC term overall survival disease-free survival . This prompt author suggest PRFA could suitable HR early stage HCC . Some author also suggest PRFA consider treatment choice patient single HCC ≤ 2.0 cm , even HR possible .
