	<brief_summary>Preeclampsia associate significant maternal fetal morbidity mortality . Early identification subsequent management patient risk develop preeclampsia present ongoing challenge prenatal care . Some risk pregnancy may identify : - serum screen abnormality first second trimester - placental shape texture 18-20 anatomical ultrasound - uterine artery blood flow . Early identification effective treatment patient would permit safe completion pregnancy mother infant . Recent advance non-invasive cardiovascular monitoring enable study maternal hemodynamics normal at-risk pregnancy . This study hop identify early significant change maternal hemodynamics may allow target therapeutic intervention patient high risk develop preeclampsia . The hypothesis study systemic vascular resistance rise pre-clinical phase preeclampsia capture use non invasive bioreactance technology . Treatment abnormally high vascular tone may decrease severity postpone onset clinical disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Invasive hemodynamic technique long identify significant increase heart rate ( HR ) , blood volume , leave ventricular end-diastolic volume ( LVEDV ) , stroke volume ( SV ) cardiac output ( CO ) first second trimester pregnancy . In normal pregnancy , CO increase early 5 week gestation , 30-40 % increase end first trim pregnancy . Cardiac output continue rise throughout second trimester reach level approximately 50 % great non-pregnant woman . Cardiac output slightly decrease third trimester . Despite change , maternal blood pressure ( BP ) still fall due large reduction systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) systemic vasodilatation formation low-resistance utero-placental circulation . Systemic vascular resistance fall early gestation , reach nadir ( 35 % decline ) 20 week gestation , rise late pregnancy . Transthoracic bioreactance newer technique non-invasive continuous cardiac output monitoring . It base analysis relative phase shift oscillate current occur current traverse thoracic cavity , oppose traditional bioimpedance-based system , rely measure change signal amplitude . Unlike bioimpedance , bioreactance-based non-invasive CO measurement use static impedance depend distance electrode calculation SV CO , significantly reduce uncertainty result . Moreover , reading show correlate well result derive pulmonary artery catheter derive measurement cardiac output . In addition , also show non-invasive cardiac output measurement ( NICOMÂ® ) system acceptable accuracy , precision responsiveness CO monitoring patient experience wide range circulatory situation recently use obstetric population . The purpose study use non-invasive cardiac output monitoring capture early inappropriate rise SVR pre clinical phase disease , patient high risk develop preeclampsia , predict placenta profile . In case increase SVR identify , purpose study implement goal-directed therapy attempt decrease severity , postpone onset clinical disease . The hypothesis study increase SVR detect pre-clinical phase preeclampsia treat goal direct therapy without fetal compromise intervention may improve maternal fetal/neonatal outcome .</detailed_description>
