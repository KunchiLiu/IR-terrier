	<brief_summary>'Unilateral neglect ' disorder occur regularly stroke . It cause right- well left-sided brain lesion , often right-sided lesion . Patients disorder neglect contralesional side space and/or body . Their body axis often shift ipsilesionally . A specific disorder appear neglect patient 'contraversive push ' : postural deviation neglect side patient push away ipsi- contralesional side . One promising neglect intervention prism adaptation ( PA ) : induce optical shift visual field mean prism glass . This result modulation brain area involve neglect improvement neglect symptoms postural deviation . Research question : 1 . Which period best suit maximize therapeutic effect ? In respect effect early delay PA compare , regard neglect- , postural cerebral measure . 2 . Which factor lead less favorable treatment outcome therapy resistance PA ? 3 . Will impact PA large postural factor take account prism therapy ?</brief_summary>
