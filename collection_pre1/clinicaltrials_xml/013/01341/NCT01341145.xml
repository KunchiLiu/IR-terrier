	<detailed_description>Cognition important determinant health status , quality life functional ability old age . Therefore , early intervention preserve enhance cognitive function crucial ensure successful age . The common treatable risk factor late-life cognitive impairment midlife hypertension ( HTN ) . One highly promising intervention strategy aerobic exercise associate cognitive benefit non-demented old adult . However , still unclear whether benefit due simply prevention risk factor ( e.g. , reduction blood pressure ) exercise reverse negative effect HTN brain . The goal current study employ sensitive measure neuroimaging cognition order 1 ) .Compare cerebral health endurance train versus sedentary middle age adult normal borderline stage 1 hypertension , 2 ) . measure effect exercise train previously sedentary middle age adult adult normal borderline stage 1 hypertension , 3 ) . examine exercise-related difference change neural integrity cognition mediate systemic vascular health .</detailed_description>
