	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine proportion men know suspected coronary artery disease ( CAD ) and/or peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) angiographic identifiable erectile relate artery ( ERA ) atherosclerotic disease define least one ERA stenosis great equal 50 % ( per core lab Quantitative Vascular Analysis - QVA ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Incidence Male Pudendal Artery Stenosis Suboptimal Erections Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular insufficiency commonly cite cause Erectile Dysfunction ( ED ) common treatment ED target aspect penile vasculature . Initial pharmacotherapy typically focus penile microvasculature ; however , surgical revascularization also use treat ED cause lesion internal iliac artery ( IIA ) and/or internal pudendal artery ( IPA ) penile artery . Anatomically , surgical revascularization connects inferior epigastric artery dorsal artery penis combination dorsal artery vein penis . The pudendal artery deep artery penis usually target surgical bypass . Recent advance percutaneous revascularization spark interest penile revascularization treat ED . However , new percutaneous treatment modality evolve , several important clinical question remain unanswered . Important among normal angiographic anatomy erectile related artery ( ERA ) , angiographic finding correlate symptom ED ? Also , many men could possible benefit percutaneous revascularization ? The normal IPA anatomy contrast angiography well defined study correlate IPA finding erectile function . While study do population men suspect vasculogenic chronic ED , study establish normal angiographic anatomy IPA evaluate prevalence angiographic IPA occlusive disease . Therefore , angiographic prevalence study assist determine population men could potentially benefit percutaneous treatment atherosclerotic IPA lesion .</detailed_description>
