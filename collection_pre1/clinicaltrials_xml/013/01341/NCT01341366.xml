	<brief_summary>Background : Laparoscopic colorectal surgery show randomized trial associate well short-term clinical outcome compare open surgery . However , traditional perioperative care set , reduction hospital stay follow laparoscopic surgery trial modest . Fast-track perioperative program introduce West optimize perioperative factor reduce physiological/psychological stress open colorectal surgery . However , study evaluate impact fast-track program outcome laparoscopic colorectal surgery . Objective : To compare clinical immunological outcome Hong Kong Chinese patient undergo laparoscopic surgery colorectal cancer `` traditional '' vs. `` fast-track '' perioperative program . Design : Prospective randomize trial . Subjects : One hundred twenty-eight consecutive patient undergo elective laparoscopic resection non-metastatic colonic upper rectal cancer recruit . Interventions : Patients randomize `` traditional '' `` fast-track '' perioperative program . Outcome measure : Primary outcome : total postoperative hospital stay , include hospital stay patient readmitted within 30 day surgery . Secondary outcome : immunological parameter ( include systemic cytokine response cell-mediated immune function ) , morbidity mortality , quality life , medical cost .</brief_summary>
