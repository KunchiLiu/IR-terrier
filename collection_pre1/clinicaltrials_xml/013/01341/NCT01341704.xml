	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 b , randomize , control trial , compare MSP3-LSP experimental malaria vaccine comparator Verorab rabies vaccine ( primary series ) normal saline ( secondary/booster series ) . The trial conduct two site , Doneguebougou surroundings ( Koulikoro ) Bougoula Hameau surroundings ( Sikasso ) . Each site enroll 400 subject . Subjects age 12-48 month enrol randomize 1:1 ratio receive either 30 µg MSP3-LSP/AlOH 0.5 mL control vaccine , Verorab Rabies subcutaneously . The primary series vaccination give day 0 , 28 56 . The first secondary/booster series administer 3 month complete primary series ( D146 ) Year 1 , subsequent booster dos administer one year 3rd dose ( D416 ) one year first booster dose ( D506 ) Year 2 . For safety , occurrence adverse event solicit daily home visit field worker 6 day vaccination . Unsolicited adverse event document follow 28 day dose . For efficacy , suspect case detect weekly home visit follow 1st vaccination continue throughout duration trial . In addition active case detection home visit , parent care-givers subject advise sign symptom illness instructed bring sick child on-site clinic assessment treatment . Study clinical staff available round-the clock entire duration trial . During unscheduled visit malaria smear , blood paper filter hemoglobin do case sign symptom compatible clinical malaria . Children follow two year follow first vaccination . Clinic visit schedule throughout follow-up period clinical assessment , malaria smear , blood paper filter hemoglobin systematically day 0 , 28 , 56 , 86 , 116 , 146 , 180 , 236 , 326 , 416 , 446 , 506 , 536 730 . The humoral immune response vaccine antigen assess use ELISA day 0 , 28 , 56 , 86 , 116 , 146 , 180 , 236 , 416 , 446 , 506 , 730 . Cellular immune response vaccine antigen ( MSP3-LSP peptide , b , c , ) assess day 0 , 86,146 , 416 use CBA subset 50 MSP3 vaccinated individual . The functionality induce immune response use Western Blot ( WB ) method ADCI technique evaluate screening day 86 , 146 , 236 , 416 , 506 730 .</detailed_description>
