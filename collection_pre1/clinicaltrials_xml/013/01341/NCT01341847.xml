	<brief_summary>Aim Study : This study compare colonoscopy examination air method ( air insufflation ) water method ( water infusion ) unsedated patient indication ( symptom sign base ) colonoscopy examination . This study base earlier study show water method well result reduce abdominal pain , caecal intubation patient willingness repeat colonoscopy examination air method . Background : Colonoscopy examination important method examine establish diagnosis various disease colon . Colonoscopy successful tip scope reach cecum observe caecal valve and/ appendix orifice . This examination perform unsedated sedation ( conscious sedation deep sedation/general anaesthesia ) . The main disadvantage unsedated colonoscopy method abdominal discomfort pain examination may make patient distress hemodynamically unstable possibly stoppage examination reach cecum , severity abdominal symptom vary patient patient . Many effort try reduce abdominal discomfort examination . This unsedated method air insufflation hospital standard method colonoscopy examination since early 1980s , less 1 % patient colonoscopied conscious deep sedation . Our study show success rate standard unsedated method 82 % . The advantage method inexpensive ( feasible people develop country like u ) , patient may examine ambulatory without escort , may back work soon examination finish . Studies show replace air insufflation water infusion colon since begin examination increase success rate caecal intubation reduce abdominal pain symptom colonoscopy examination ( 1 ) . Sedation general anaesthesia may increase success rate colonoscopy examination costly , may increase adverse event especially elderly patient significance cardiopulmonary problem . Research Design Methods : Eligible patient hospital clinic ward offer follow unsedated colonoscopy examination . The principle investigator ( PI ) explain study , colonoscopy procedure , various symptom may felt examination , possible adverse event medical effort prevent . Patient sign inform consent include study . Methods day exam . Enrolled patient send endoscopy room colonoscopy perform principle investigator . Patient lie leave lateral position right hip knee flex left leg straight . When PI start single-handed colonoscopy examination , blind observer open seal envelops code enclose . A standard colonoscope insert . Patient may order change position abdominal compression may apply nurse aid colonoscope advancement . Oximetry , cardiac rhythm blood pressure monitor examination . Blinding perform study feeling water air effect inside colon differentiate patient opinion actually blinded..The control method include usual air insufflation insertion shorten maneuver . The study method include water infusion ( air pump turn ) colonoscope insertion since scope insert anus reach cecum . Water infuse need endoscopist judgement adaptor biopsy channel endoscopic washer pump . The usual air insufflation use colonoscope withdrawal facilitate mucosal examination perform intervention , biopsy . Hypothesis testing : The unsedated colonoscopy natural temperature water infusion minimize pain symptom unsedated colonoscopy usual air insufflation .</brief_summary>
