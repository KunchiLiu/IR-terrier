	<brief_title>Using Amniotic Membrane Carrier ex Vivo Cell Culture Cell Therapy Ocular Surface Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human amniotic membrane ( AM ) compose three layer : single epithelial layer , thick basement membrane , avascular stroma . The amniotic membrane first use along chorion biologic membrane promote heal skin burn 1910 . In ophthalmology , use 1940 management conjunctival defect . Its revival 1990s due ability reduce ocular surface inflammation scarring , promote rapid epithelialization due presence growth factor , antimicrobial properties.1,2 The amniotic membrane biologic tissue use graft corneal conjunctival reconstruction variety ocular surface disease . It avascular possess anti-angiogenetic , anti-scarring antiinflammatory property . It substitute rather substrate upon cell migrate regenerate , form new healthy tissue.2 Amniotic membrane several property extremely useful ocular surgery2,3 : 1 . Promotes Epithelialization : Amniotic membrane act like basement membrane facilitate migration epithelial cells.4 It reinforce adhesion basal epithelial cell , promote epithelial differentiation , prevent epithelial apoptosis , improve corneal sensitivity tear film stability,5 although exact mechanism know . It also produce growth factor promote epithelial cell growth.6 It believe expand maintain epithelial progenitor cell ex vivo.7 2 . Inhibits Fibrosis : Fibroblasts normally responsible scar associate wound heal activate transform growth factor TGF-β . Amniotic membrane downregulates TGF-βand receptor expression fibroblast thus reduces fibrosis . Choi Tseng 8,9 implant dispase-treated amniotic membrane without cultured rabbit corneal epithelial cell intrastromally rabbit cornea . They observe amniotic membrane alone induce keratocyte differentiation myofibroblasts cornea remain clear . Amniotic membrane also suppress TGF-β signal corneal limbal fibroblast conjunctival pterygial fibroblasts.10 3 . Antiinflammatory Antiangiogenic Factors : There several report reduction inflammation amniotic membrane.11 The exact mechanism know . The amniotic membrane probably act barrier tear film result reduced amount inflammatory cell hence amount inflammatory mediators.12 In addition , presence proteinase inhibitor may promote heal . 4 . Antimicrobial Antiviral Properties : Amniotic membrane seem antimicrobial property decrease risk postoperative infection . It also contain cystatin E , analogue cysteine proteinase inhibitor , complementary antiviral properties.13 Its antimicrobial possible antiviral property warrant study . 5 . High Hydraulic Conductivity : The different layer placenta study , find amniotic membrane high hydraulic conductivity , thus facilitate use bleb repair follow glaucoma-filtering surgery.14 Amniotic membrane transplantation currently use continuously widen spectrum ophthalmic indication . Amniotic membrane transplantation show effective reconstruction corneal surface set persistent epithelial defect , sterile corneal ulceration , partial limbal stem cell ( LSC ) deficiency state , include secondary chemical thermal burn . The amniotic membrane several property promote epithelialization reduce inflammation , prompt use management persistent epithelial defects,15,16 deep ulcers,17,18 neurotrophic ulcers,19 perforations,20,21 initial success rate vary 50 % 90 % . Multiple layer AM restore stromal thickness deep perforate noninfectious ulcer probably provide substrate collagen growth factor epithelial healing . AMT also use huge pterygium recurrent pterygium.27 The limitation AMT include continuous tissue destruction beneath graft , need adequate stem cell limbus normal keratocytes surround tissue , intact sensory innervation healing.15 In mild moderate chemical injury , AMT restore corneal conjunctival surface . It prevent symblepharon formation severe burns.22,23 In severe case , owe extensive ocular surface inflammation deep stromal ischemia near-total destruction limbal stem cell , amniotic membrane may best reduce inflammation , prevent stem cell damage , prevent symblepharon formation acute stage . Joseph et al 24 describe complete failure AMT 4 case acute grade 4 chemical burn complete loss vision . With development cell therapy , amniotic membrane also use carrier limbal stem cell progeny , cultivate vitro.2,25,26 Most recently , ex vivo cultivation expansion limbal epithelial cell perform utilize AM matrix . However , superiority AMT treatment modality many setting need substantiate controlled clinical trials.5 The use amniotic membrane ophthalmic surgery show provide alternative corneal conjunctival reconstruction many clinically challenge situation . It without doubt provide option previously none existed condition . Nevertheless , limitation universally successful every indication . The indication use ever increase , often anecdotal evidence . In instance successfully use , exist time simpler option equally effective . The collective global experience membrane vast , field move proper randomize controlled study evaluate true potential.1,2,28</detailed_description>
