	<brief_summary>This study conduct see safe effective Prevena Incision Management System `` Prevena '' place renal transplantation incision . Prevena provide negative pressure ( suction ) wound therapy . Prevena test applied time subject hospitalize 5 day surgery . Prevena small portable negative pressure device consist therapy unit delivers negative pressure . It also include dress system intend use close incision surgery . The intent study evaluate Prevena versus standard care doctor would use normally kidney transplant .</brief_summary>
