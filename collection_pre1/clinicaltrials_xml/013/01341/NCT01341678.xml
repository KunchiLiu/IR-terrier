	<detailed_description>In normal healthy individual , 12-hour 24-hour circadian rhythm serum phosphorus ( serum P ) nadir early-mid morning , rise minor peak afternoon ( around 4:00PM ) , rise major peak midnight . In study 6 healthy male patient , Portale et al find 12-hour component modify dietary P intake whereas 24-hour rhythm serum P independent intake phosphorus . Additionally , trial demonstrate large swing amplitude peak nadir serum P normal healthy subject ( 1.2 mg/dL ) also demonstrate large difference mean 24-hour serum P normal vs. high dietary P intake , however difference fast AM serum P result observe . These finding may suggest poor performance serum P biomarker intervention aim P load reduction via treatment option phosphate binder salivary P-binder chewing gum . While circadian rhythm serum phosphorus healthy individual describe , data exists circadian rhythm salivary P , circadian rhythm serum P describe subject moderate kidney disease expose various level dietary P exposure . In recent year , saliva find good indicator plasma level various substance , one phosphorus . Specifically , increase salivary P excretion report patient CKD . Daily salivary secretion volume range 500 - 700 mL/day , therefore salivary P recently establish previously unaccounted source phosphorus , contribute conservative estimate 366 mg/day 2500 mg/week immediately bioavailable phosphorus . There significant amount data available regard utilization serum P biomarker intervention aim phosphorus load reduction ; however , minimal information regard time phosphorus measurement ( i.e . serum P assess 24-hour period ) available . Wolf et al , demonstrate despite 80 % reduction urinary P dietary P restriction treatment P binders 2-week period , change serum P FGF-23 . However , biomarkers sample every 3 day 2-week period without regard time day . This suggest single time point measurement serum P patient CKD accurately reflect phosphate load . As , plausible mean 24-hour serum P , mean 24-hour serum FGF-23 better marker phosphorus load CKD single measurement . Additionally , publish indicator 24-hour mean serum P patient CKD . It reasonable either salivary P FGF-23 might optimal predictor . Therefore , study examine 24-hour mean serum P relationship single mean salivary P value well single mean FGF-23 value control set specific low , normal high phosphate diet . This examination understand mean serum P value relate biomarkers FGF-23 salivary P variation intestinal phosphate load inform design conduct future interventional trial assess reduction phosphorus load . This study single-center , exploratory trial subject reduce kidney function . A total 9 eligible subject estimate GFR 30 - 45 mL/min ± 10 % 3 normal healthy subject control sequentially expose three different Phosphorus diet ( normal , low high ) . Study assessment occur inpatient ( observation ) outpatient ( clinic ) setting . A total four observational inpatient day ( Days 7 , 12 , 18 , 29 ) require throughout study . Serum , saliva , urine specimen collect specified time-points begin Day 1 visit conclude Day 36 Follow-Up visit . During inpatient study visit , blood , urine , salivary sample collect every 4 hour . Subjects provide specific diet create use 1500 mg P base diet supplement NeutraPhos® achieve desire P load describe table . During treatment period 2 ( Low P Diet ) , patient receive alternative low P diet additionally receive lanthanum carbonate 1000 mg meal ensure low dietary P load .</detailed_description>
