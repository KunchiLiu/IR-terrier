	<brief_summary>Currently , U.S. , 1 3 male 2 5 female born 2000 expect develop diabetes lifetime . Research demonstrate control blood glucose ( BG ) reduce complication diabetes . As result , almost half Americans diagnosed diabetes , prescribe finger-stick glucose meter monitor BG . The value approach know limited high rate patient non-compliance BG testing , patient test less often prescribed . Increased communication patient care manager along feedback show increase self monitor blood glucose ( SMBG ) test compliance . However , feedback loop largely absent current , episodic model patient / care manager interaction available exist BG meter give diabetic patient . In study , propose pilot test cellular-embedded glucose meter . This device transmit glucose reading directly cellular network care management server patient receive feedback screen glucose meter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research program enroll participant 6-month pilot intervention study . In study , 100 patient diabetes ( Type 1 Type 2 ) know non-compliant SMBG enrol randomize treatment group ( one group receive standard glucose meter second group receive cellular-embedded device ) order achieve follow specific study aim ; Primary Aim 1 : Determine connect diabetic patient care manager via cellular-enabled glucose meter feedback improve SMBG test compliance . Secondary Aim 2 : Determine increase test compliance lead improvement overall blood glucose control . This measured reduction HbA1c level . Secondary Aim 3 : Determine whether intervention lead significant improvement patient satisfaction self-care patient self-assessment compliance .</detailed_description>
