	<detailed_description>The current treatment elevate serum phosphorus level chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) consist dietary restriction P provision phosphate binder act level intestinal absorption phosphorus ( P ) ingest meal . This paradigm proven inadequate achieve normo-phosphatemia indicated elevate serum P level patient receive renal replacement therapy . Salivary phosphate level elevate patient CKD salivary P represent large source otherwise hidden non-dietary phosphate easily absorb may contribute persistent elevation serum P despite standard therapy . Savica et al perform preliminary study , small population ( n-13 ) hyperphosphatemic patient receive hemodialysis , phosphate restriction phosphate binder , give K2CG chew gum 20 mg . The chew gum administer twice per day 60 minute fast period ( meal ) 15 day . In addition significant reduction salivary P , serum P reduce 2 mg/dL ( 31 % ) treatment period . Both salivary serum P return baseline value K2CG discontinuation . The author conclude add salivary P bind traditional phosphate binder could useful approach improve treatment hyperphosphatemia patient receive renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . Given public health importance increase P level general population specifically patient chronic kidney disease , great importance evaluate ability medical food K2CG reduce elevate serum P level . In patient CKD receive RRT estimate sustain control serum P may result approximate 17 % reduction mortality . The specific purpose study compare total P recover per piece chew gum 20 mg 60 mg version reformulate K2CG without extender gum core . Additionally , unique P binding reformulate gum assess comparison total P entrap per piece chew gum match placebo . Subjects assign one 3 different group show table . The study single blind study . Subjects blind strength/formulation chew gum active/placebo assignment . Group Active Chewing Week 1 Active Chewing Week 2 20 mg extender 20 mg Placebo 20 Placebo 60 60 mg extender 60 mg Subjects chew K2CG gum single strength/formulation 7 day ( Active Chewing Week 1 ) twice day ( BID ) . K2CG gum must chew least 60 minute fast condition . This follow second 7 day chew K2CG gum ( Active Chewing Week 2 ) different strength/formulation describe . There run-in period wash period Active Chewing Week 1 Active Chewing Week 2 .</detailed_description>
