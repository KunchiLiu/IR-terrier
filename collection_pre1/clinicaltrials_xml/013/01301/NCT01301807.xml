	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Plus Panobinostat Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma ( MM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drugs : Carfilzomib design keep cancer cell repair . If cancer cell repair , may cause die . Panobinostat design slow growth cancer cell kill cancer cell block certain enzyme ( protein produce cell ) . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase 1A portion study , 56 total participant enrol Phase 1B . If enrolled Phase 1A portion , dose carfilzomib panobinostat receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level carfilzomib panobinostat . Each new group receive high dose carfilzomib and/or panobinostat group , intolerable side effect see . Sometimes , new dose level one drug raise , dose level drug dose give early group . The study staff explain group assign . This dose-raising pattern continue high tolerable dose study drug combination find . If enrolled Phase 1B portion , receive carfilzomib panobinostat high dos tolerate Phase 1A portion . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . You receive carfilzomib Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 cycle . Carfilzomib give vein 30 minute . The study staff check side effect least 1 hour receive carfilzomib . You also give fluid vein hour , every Cycle 1 dose . Starting 2 day first dose carfilzomib , must drink 6-8 cup ( 8 ounce ) water day . This make sure properly hydrate first dose carfilzomib . The study staff tell many day need drink much water . All study participant Cycle 1 . If doctor think need , base risk develop certain side effect , may need keep hydration plan Cycle 2 beyond . Before dose carfilzomib Cycle 1 , every dose increase , receive dexamethasone vein . This drug give try avoid lessen side effect ( allergic reaction ) may occur receive study drug . You take panobinostat mouth day Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 study cycle . On Days 1 8 cycle , panobinostat dose take 4 hour end carfilzomib infusion . The panobinostat capsule ( ) swallow mouth glass ( 8 ounce ) water . You try take dose around time day . If vomit take panobinostat , take next schedule dose . If forget take dose morning , take 12 hour later . If miss dose 12 hour , wait next schedule dose . Do make missed dos . On Day 1 every new study cycle , wait take dose come clinic study test . Some Day 1 test need perform dosing . You need follow dose instruction write . Do miss capsule . You ask return unused study drug bottle provide , along empty bottle , Day 1 every cycle , start Cycle 2 . Capsules transfer bottle time . Please allow anyone else handle touch study drug . Maintenance Dosing : After 8 cycle therapy , may continue receive carfilzomib Days 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 , panobinostat Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 cycle , tolerate , long doctor think best interest . If disease becomes bad period , stay study continue receive carfilzomib original dosing schedule ( Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 cycle ) . If unusual symptom intolerable side effect assign dose level , dose may lower . If need , may also stop take panobinostat short time , side effect ( ) closely watch doctor get well . If history herpes simplex zoster , study doctor think need , take acyclovir ( anti-viral drug ) study . Your doctor explain often need take anti-viral drug . Study Visits : On Day 1 every cycle : - You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . Your BSA also calculate . - Your performance status measure . - You ask drug may take symptom side effect may ( include numbness and/or tingle ) . - You ECGs dose panobinostat . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , also ECGs perform 3 hour dose . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Starting Cycle 2 , routine blood draw also include pregnancy test able become pregnant . To keep take part study , pregnancy test must negative . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect check status disease . This urine collect 24-hour period . You give container urine collection . - Starting Cycle 2 , part urine sample may use pregnancy test woman able become pregnant . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn pharmacodynamics ( PD ) test . PD test use look level study drug body may affect disease . ( Cycle 1 ) On Day 1 Cycle : Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw biomarker testing , may include genetic biomarkers . Biomarkers find blood may relate reaction study drug . On Days 2 , 9 , 16 Cycle 1 : - Your vital sign measure . - On Days 9 16 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn PD testing . On Day 5 Cycle 1 , ECGs dose panobinostat . You need wait take panobinostat dose tell clinic . On Days 8 15 Cycle 1 : - You measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycle 2 : °Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn PD testing . On Days 2 , 9 , 16 Cycle 2 beyond : °Your vital sign measure . On Days 8 15 Cycle 2 beyond : - Your vital sign measure . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-dosing visit . End-of-Dosing Visit : Within 30 day stop take study drug , End-of-Treatment Visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign . Your BSA also calculate . - Your performance status record . - You ECG . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You ask drug may take side effect symptom ( numbness and/or tingle ) may . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect check status disease . This urine collect 24-hour period . You give container urine collection . This investigational study . Carfilzomib FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type multiple myeloma . Its use study investigational . Panobinostat FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 46 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
