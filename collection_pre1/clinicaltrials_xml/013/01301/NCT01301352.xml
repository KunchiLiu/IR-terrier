	<brief_title>Feeding Children Nasogastrically Versus Nasojejunally While Receiving Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It experience placement post-pyloric tube difficult , tube frequently become obstructed difficult replace , result lose caloric intake patient . The population relevant child receive Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation ( NPPV ) . NPPV become increasingly popular Pediatric Intensive Care Unit ( PICU ) population , due perception safe effective alternative mechanical ventilation via endotracheal tube . Historically , NPPV use child chronic respiratory insufficiency , application acute respiratory compromise increase . It show effective disease state associate hypoventilation , also apply respiratory problem lead decreased oxygenation . Infants child receive noninvasive ventilation respiratory failure , often infectious origin , significant caloric need . However , practice allow gastric feeding patient due fear gastric distension vomiting , carry risk aspiration . There data available question efficacy safety gastric feed critically-ill child support noninvasive ventilation . Given ease ( ) placement , potential nutritional benefit earlier feeding provide gastric feeding , seem clinically important question bias route enteral nutrition noninvasively ventilate patient . The investigator therefore propose pilot randomize trial gastric versus post-pyloric feed patient NPPV .</detailed_description>
