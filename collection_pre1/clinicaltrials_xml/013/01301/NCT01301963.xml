	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study filgrastim ( G-CSF ) without plerixafor treat patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) previously treat lenalidomide . Giving colony-stimulating factor , G-CSF , plerixafor help stem cell move patient 's bone marrow blood collect store</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Filgrastim With Without Plerixafor Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Previously Treated With Lenalidomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Ability reach target collection 5 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/Kg = &lt; 2 day leukaphereses use one two mobilization regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Percentage patient achieve target goal CD34+ cell dose ( ) = &lt; 5 day leukaphereses . II . Compare collection different mobilization regimens patient cross one mobilization regimen . III . Compare day apheresis , need hospitalization mobilization , need remobilization mobilize group . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive G-CSF subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) day 1-8 . ARM II : Patients receive G-CSF SC QD day 1-7 plerixafor SC QD day 4-7 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 14 day .</detailed_description>
