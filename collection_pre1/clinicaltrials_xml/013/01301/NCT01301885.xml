	<brief_summary>Endometriosis chronic disease characterize presence functional endometrial gland stroma ectopic location outside uterine cavity . The ectopic endometrial tissue respond estradiol hormone similarly normal endometrium . Endometriosis one common benign gynecological condition , many 5-10 % woman reproductive age may affect . In addition pain may severe , subfertility one typical problem associate endometriosis may present 40 % affect . There lack clear correlation severity pain degree compromise fertility . Different modes treatment exist . Hormonal treatment base suppression estrogenic action endometriosis well endometrium . Unfortunately , discontinuation hormonal treatment typically result rapid recurrence disease . Surgery may alleviate symptom different lengths time , however , curative treatment frequently involve hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy . In order escape radical treatment , new target therapy form novel pharmacological agent would crucial importance . Presently , endometriosis reliably diagnose laparoscopy . Since invasive surgical procedure , new diagnostic tool would warmly welcome . Furthermore , progression disease presently impossible predict , new marker `` malignancy '' case desperately need . The aim investigator research identify expression endometriosis specific RNAs/proteins . Evaluation expression profile sample endometriosis endometrium patient careful clinical surgical classification endometriosis well healthy control woman initially enable identify novel target new therapy biomarkers . Furthermore , combine adequate follow , study enable example identify marker endometriosis associate infertility well case disease progress rapidly . Different form effective treatment may thereafter design follow identification factor .</brief_summary>
