	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction . Pentavalent antimonials first line drug treatment leishmaniasis . WHO Brazilian Ministry Health recommend treat patient mucosal ( ML ) mucocutaneous leishmaniasis ( MCL ) dose 20mg/kg/day , intramuscularly intravenously , period three four week . In Reference Centre Leishmaniasis - IPEC - FIOCRUZ , dose 5mg/kg/day IM effective well tolerate treatment . ML treat 30 continuous intermittent day , series 10 day intersperse period 10 day without medication , 12 series treatment ( 120 medication day ) , low incidence adverse effect lower treatment dropout rate . The evolution lesion usually similar observe continuous treatment . In case patient monitor clinical examination , electrocardiogram , blood count , liver function , renal pancreatic test . Some side effect observe , although necessarily lead discontinuation treatment : arthralgia , myalgia , anorexia , abdominal pain , rash , fever , headache , edema , herpes zoster . Electrocardiographic abnormality frequent heart rhythm ventricular repolarization disturbance : flatten inversion T wave correct QT space widening . 2 . Background : Ideally , appropriate antimoniate therapeutic regimen establish endemic area , base efficacy toxicity , without ignore difficulty administration cost . The treatment ML MCL must achieve heal mucosal lesion prevention severe scar mucosal tissue consequent disability . The recognition , recommendation acceptance new regimen precede demonstration superiority currently recommend treatment . We aim compare effectiveness safety among treatment scheme meglumine antimoniate currently recommend Brazil treatment ATL alternative scheme low dos antimony . 3 . Objectives . 3.1 . General Objective . To compare effectiveness safety meglumine antimoniate dose 20 mg/kg/day 30 day 5 mg continuous 120 day , treatment patient ML MCL . 3.2 . Specific Objectives . 1 . To compare frequency epithelialization reduction mucosal infiltration ( assessed day 30 , 120 , 150 begin treatment ) two group . 2 . To compare frequency good late therapeutic response ( maintenance epithelialization , total regression infiltration re-emergence skin lesion ) two group , two year . 3 . To compare frequency severity adverse clinical , laboratory electrocardiogram effect two group , control age 60 year . 4 . To compare time day epithelialization reduction infiltration lesion two group , accord nasal , oropharyngeal laryngeal location . 4 . Subjects method . 4 . 1 . Study design : Controlled clinical trial standard alternative treatment , randomize , double-blind , phase III . 4.2 . Description intervention : Meglumine antimoniate ( Aventis , SÃ£o Paulo , Brazil ) store minister actual condition employ health service Brazil . A single lot medication use patient . Each patient include one two treatment group meglumine antimoniate IM : 1 ) 20mg / kg / day 30 continuous day . Patients remain active lesion day 120 begin treatment re-treated regimen . 2 ) 5mg / kg / day continuous epithelization resolution mucosal infiltration , respect limit 120 day treatment . There cross-over group purpose study . The data patient require permanent discontinuation scheme assess group randomize , ie , intention treat . 4.3 . Sampling plan . 4.3.1 Sample size . The comparison effectiveness two scheme probably reveal superiority alternative scheme ( continuous low dose ) follow outcome : 1 ) frequency good initial response ( epithelialization resolution mucosal infiltration ) day 150 . 2 ) frequency good late response ( maintenance epithelialization total regression infiltration ) 2 year . We consider significance level 5 % 80 % power calculate sample size need compare group . Initially , 76-total patient require ( 38 patient group ) compare standard group alternative group . 4.4 Allocation strategy ( randomization ) . Eligible individual agree participate ( sign inform consent ) randomly assign one two treatment group , accord order arrival , completion group . 4.5 . Eligibility Criteria ( see item : Eligibility Criteria ) . 4.6 . Outcomes . 4.6.1 Effectiveness Outcome : Definition : 1 . Initial therapeutic response - presence complete epithelization lesion day 150 . 2 . Late therapeutic response mucosal leishmaniasis : maintenance epithelialization total regression infiltration 2 year . 4.6.2 Safety Outcomes ( adverse event ) : definition , intensity relationship study drug . Adverse event ( AE ) consider event , adverse unexpected , evidenced investigator report patient , begin use drug within 30 day stop . The investigation AE make spontaneous recall question physician standardized form every 10 day medication day 30 completion treatment . All EA monitor disappearance . The classification severity adverse event ( clinical , laboratory electrocardiographic ) take place accord `` AIDS Table Grading Severity Adult Adverse Experiences , 1992 '' . The causal relationship study drug ( = AE ) evaluate investigator classify follow : ) Definite ( Highly Likely ) ; b ) Probable ; c ) Possible ; ) Remote ( Probably ) ; e ) Definitely . 4.7 . Medications allow . There restriction use symptomatic medication diseases except list exclusion criterion . 4.8 . Management adverse effect . The AE note appropriate form shall contain : description adverse effect , intensity , relation investigate drug , start date , completion date , duration conduct take . 4.9 . Masking . We choose perform measurement outcomes interest ( effectiveness ) adverse event ( security ) physician aware regimen use patient . It intend minimize measurement bias different outcome accord treatment regimen patient belongs . The result laboratory test provide clinical pathology laboratory without information treatment group . The manager database preserve secrecy information cod group analysis epidemiologist ( ) . 4.10 . Criteria definitive discontinuation study treatment : ) Interruption driven clinical , laboratory electrocardiographic AE Grade 4 ; b ) Interruption exceed 10 day attribute clinical , laboratory electrocardiographic adverse event Grade &lt; 3 ; c ) Spontaneous cessation use prescribed medication beyond five consecutive dos , due fault administration ( noncompliance ) . 4.11 . Criteria study withdrawal : ) definitive interruption treatment ; b ) pregnancy ; c ) introduction immunosuppressive potentially toxic drug ; ) intercurrent disease , unrelated study drug , manifestation equivalent superior clinical grade 3 AE ; e ) poor initial late therapeutic response ; f ) patient abandonment continue study . 4.12 . Procedures confidentiality break . The randomization code use allocation number allocation patient may reveal case necessity study . 4.13 . Monitoring study . The parameter ( outcome ) effectiveness safety monitor accord timetable implementation . The principal investigator coordinator supervise field work , control quality deviation Protocol . Important item monitor : adhesion Protocol ( follow-up loss minimize active search ) , appropriate record outcomes adverse event ; adequacy store product ; quality procedures laboratory test ; minimization miss data ; periodic transmission data data entry . Written report field retain consideration committee . Serious adverse event report Ethical Committee perhaps decision interrupt test make . External Committee : committee outside monitor trial shall constitute , consist three member , expert treatment leishmaniasis execution clinical trial . The committee carry audit documentation activity relevant clinical trial , control possible protocol break . 4.14 Control storage medication . The ampoule require complete treatment whole sample store IPEC Pharmacy . A trained professional team include patient , day 1 consultation , follow randomization list . 4.15 . Data Analysis Plan . Data analysis carry follow principle intention treat . The data patient require permanent discontinuation scheme analyze accord group allocate initially , re-assigned another group resumption treatment ( cross-over group purpose study ) . We describe simple frequency categorical variable measure central tendency dispersion continuous quantitative variable antimony scheme . The proportion dichotomous outcome presence absence good early late therapeutic response alternative regimen compare standard one chi-square test , day extent epithelialization reduction infiltration lesion nasal , oropharyngeal laryngeal location study survival time analysis two group ( log-rank statistic ) . If necessary , nonparametric test use . Effectiveness safety also evaluate relative risk ( RR ) , absolute risk reduction ( ARR ) relative risk reduction ( RRR ) . 5 . Ethical consideration . 6.1 Risks benefit . The main potential benefit test possibility subsidize use low dos antimony , potentially less toxic less costly . The risk consist general adverse event , thoroughly scrutinize treat . This project submit Ethics Research Committee ( CEP/IPEC ) National Ethics Research Council ( CONEP ) . All patient sign informed consent approve CEP/IPEC . This project follow recommendation National Health Council . 5.2 . Informed consent . In plain language explain objective , risk , benefit identify responsible research . 6 . Expected Results . We hope different scheme equivalent effectiveness , diverse toxicity . 7 .
