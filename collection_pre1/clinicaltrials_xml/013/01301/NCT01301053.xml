	<brief_summary>The investigator believe remain gap implement insulin infusion critically ill patient maximize benefit minimize adverse event like episode hypoglycemia . Based published experience Continuous Glucose Monitor ( CGM ) , investigator believe safe use critically ill patient . Furthermore , investigator believe combination protocol low risk hypoglycemia baseline , CGM eliminate risk fully . In study investigator : 1 . Study safety feasibility continuous glucose monitor use 20 critically ill patient 7 day ( current maximum recommendation sensor use ) . Safety data include rate significant bleeding ( hematoma ) infection ( cellulitis ) sensor use . Feasibility data evaluate amount miss glucose data 7-day sensor life . 2 . Randomize patient treated current UVA intensive care insulin protocol insulin management addition `` brake '' reduce insulin administration base continuous glucose monitoring data hourly reference glucose data prevent episode hypoglycemia ( blood glucose &lt; 70 mg/dl ) severe hypoglycemia ( blood glucose &lt; 50 mg/dl ) . This serve pilot data power large study future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The principle focus project collect pilot data large study test hypothesis continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) safe critically ill patient provide important information prevent hypoglycemia . This study determine feasibility CGM along current UVA intensive care insulin protocol critically ill hyperglycemic patient well provide information may help estimate difference necessary power future study . The following statement summarize background protocol : 1 . Hyperglycemia prevalent critical illness , even without prior diabetes , associate increased mortality . 2 . The physiology critical illness hyperglycemia may secondary inappropriate tissue oxygenation intense inflammatory mediator release lead elevate counter-regulatory hormone stimulate endogenous glucose production promote insulin resistance . 3 . Early research Van den Berghe suggest control hyperglycemia insulin infusion improve outcome ; however , contest part Normoglycemia Intensive Care Evaluation-Survival Using Glucose Algorithm Regulation ( NICE-SUGAR ) study . 4 . The result NICE-SUGAR study may reflect difference control glucose range high incidence hypoglycemia . 5 . Hypoglycemia show associate increased mortality ICU . 6 . Glucose variability associate ICU mortality . 7 . Continuous glucose monitor show safe 7 day critically ill patient may prevent episode hypoglycemia</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 18 y.o . Admitted intensive care unit Patient require insulin infusion currently prescribe insulin infusion ICU admission . Below 18 year age Pregnancy Cancer , active diagnosis Moribund , Do Not Resuscitate ( DNR ) /Do Not Intubate ( DNI ) , death predict within 24 hour . Patients diabetic ketoacidosis hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state exclude manage different insulin protocol Patients type 1 diabetes exclude unique insulin need might confound pilot study . Plan anticipate need MRI study period Use acetaminophen within 24 hour prior enrollment Use medication UVa formulary containing maltose , galactose , xylose could affect glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinoline quinine ( GDHPQQ ) glucose test strip ( hepatitis B immune globulin ( HepaGamB® ) , tositumomab [ Bexxar® ] , abatacept [ Orencia® ] , Octagam 5 % , RH immune globulin [ WinRho® ] ) Lack appropriate abdominal site insertion Dexcom sensor ( e.g . extensive scarring , lack adequate subcutaneous tissue , local infection , etc . ) Restrictions use drug treatment . According Dexcom SEVEN® PLUS G4 Platinum user manual , Dexcom System must remove prior Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) . Therefore , subject require MRI , sensor remove patient reason removal note . This Adverse Event , conclude patient 's participation study . If subject require use acetaminophencontaining medication part clinical care use system sensor subject study drug may affect performance device . If subject require use medication UVa formulary containing maltose , galactose , xylose could affect glucose dehydrogenase pyrroloquinoline quinine ( GDHPQQ ) glucose test strip ( hepatitis B immune globulin [ HepaGamB® ] , tositumomab [ Bexxar® ] , abatacept [ Orencia® ] , Octagam 5 % , RH immune globulin [ WinRho® ] ) subject study drug may affect performance unit glucometer use reference value calibration continuous glucose monitor . Study participation would stop time .</criteria>
