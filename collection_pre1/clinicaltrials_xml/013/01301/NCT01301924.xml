	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction . Pentavalent antimonials first line drug treatment leishmaniasis . WHO Brazilian Ministry Health recommend treat patient cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) dose 20mg/kg/day , IM IV , three four week . In Reference Centre Leishmaniasis - IPEC - FIOCRUZ , dose 5mg/kg/day IM effective well tolerate treatment CL . CL treat 30 day , low incidence adverse effect lower treatment dropout rate . In case patient monitor clinical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , blood count , liver , renal pancreatic function test . Some side effect observe , although necessarily lead discontinuation treatment . EKG frequent abnormality heart rhythm disturbance ventricular repolarization : flattening inversion T wave adjust QT space widening . 2 . Background : Ideally , appropriate antimoniate therapeutic regimen establish area , base efficacy toxicity , without ignore difficulty administration cost . The treatment CL must achieve heal skin lesion prevention late mucosal involvement .
