	<brief_summary>Background : - Tuberculosis disease lung cause bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M. tuberculosis ) . The popular least expensive tool use detect presence tuberculosis bacteria call sputum smear , lab test use look bacteria sputum via microscope . However , test result always accurate , test determine bacteria resistant standard tuberculosis treatment . The sensitive test currently available call sputum culture , sputum sample use check growth tuberculosis bacteria . However , test take least month produce accurate result , require expensive equipment available many country M. tuberculosis find . - The urea breath test ( UBT ) use detect infection Helicobacter pylorus , bacteria associate stomach ulcer , test individual breath sample . Researchers interested determine whether breath sample also use detect presence M. tuberculosis lung subject tuberculosis , see tuberculosis treatment successful . Objectives : - To assess sensitivity specificity urea breath test diagnosis treatment response pulmonary tuberculosis . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age either diagnose tuberculosis healthy volunteer past history tuberculosis . - The study conduct Bamako , Mali . Design : - This study involve three group : two pilot group individual already diagnose tuberculosis , primary study group healthy volunteer individual diagnose tuberculosis . - Participants screen physical examination medical history , well blood , sputum , stool , urine sample . - First pilot group ( one visit ) : - Participants eat , drink , smoke least 1 hour prior UBT test . - Participants provide baseline exhale air sample , receive UBT test , involve dose Pranactin -Citric dissolve water . Additional exhale air sample collect eight time point ( 10 , 20 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 180 , 240 minute dose ) . - Second pilot group ( one two visit ) : - Participants eat , drink , smoke least 1 hour prior UBT test . - Participants provide baseline exhale air sample , receive UBT test . Half participant receive dose bismuth ( Pepto-Bismol ) prior collection air sample see affect result UBT test . Additional exhale air sample collect three time point specify study researcher . - On follow day , participant return second visit provide three exhale air sample . - Primary study group ( five visit participant tuberculosis , two visit healthy volunteer ) : - All participant two visit , follow procedure give second pilot group . Half receive dose bismuth prior collection air sample . - Participants tuberculosis three additional visit ( day 6 , 10 , 16 follow first study visit ) provide additional sputum exhale air sample monitor progress tuberculosis treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) disease affect population worldwide , 9 million people infect every year . It associate high rate mortality morbidity . Reports show person dy tuberculosis every 20 second worldwide . Current diagnostic technique either inadequate detecting TB case precision , time consuming , expensive , require laboratory equipment available develop country , disease endemic . Furthermore , rate multi-drug-resistant ( MDR ) TB estimate 5 percent incident case globally extremely drug-resistant ( XDR ) TB rate rise . These statistic highlight need new improve diagnostic tool TB , well biomarkers quickly detect drug resistant organisms treatment failure first-line antimicrobial . Urea breath test ( UBT ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) detection Helicobacter pylorus . It know H. pylorus possess urease enzyme degrades urea stomach , produce carbon dioxide ( CO ( 2 ) ) , exhale detected lung . Mycobacterium tuberculosis like H. pylori posse urease enzyme , convert urea carbon dioxide ammonia . In preclinical study , Jassal colleague demonstrate TB-infected rabbit convert [ ( 13 ) C ] -labeled urea [ ( 13 ) C ] -carbon dioxide ( ( 13 ) CO ( 2 ) ) matter minute . The ( 13 ) CO ( 2 ) exhale breath could rapidly detect isotopic ratio mass spectrometer small ultraviolet ( UV ) absorbance spectrometer . The primary objective current study evaluate sensitivity specificity UBT diagnosis treatment response pulmonary TB . Secondary objective assess specificity UBT M. tuberculosis ( UBT-TB ) diagnosis volunteer without H. pylorus infection , examine benefit bismuth make UBT-TB specific M. tuberculosis , evaluate correlation label ( 13 ) CO ( 2 ) signal sputum colony form unit ( CFU ) count low limit signal detection versus CFU count .</detailed_description>
