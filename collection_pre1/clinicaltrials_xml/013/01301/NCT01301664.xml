	<brief_summary>In study , investigator explore hypothesis osteoarthritic cartilage fragment promote chondrogenesis MSCs . Non-wearing part cartilage tissue harvest one osteoarthritic patient total knee arthroplasty surgery . Cartilage fragment MSCs wrap fibrin glue ; construct implant subcutaneously nude mouse . Moreover , investigator collect discard cartilage develop acellular cartilage ECM-derived scaffold joint replacement surgery . In addition , investigator harvest redundant bone marrow drill useless synovium surgery separate mesenchymal stem cell . Furthermore , mesenchymal stem cell transfected hTERT rejuvenation label fluorescent dye PKH26 application animal study . To sum , investigator plan use human , natural , discard material joint replacement surgery develop appropriate allograft cartilage repair hope one day ideal would apply clinical .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Extracellular matrix ( ECM ) think participate significantly guide differentiation process mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) . In study , explore hypothesis osteoarthritic cartilage matrix promote chondrogenesis MSCs . Cartilage matrix harvest health-like part osteoarthritic cartilage tissue . Cartilage fragment MSCs wrap fibrin glue ; construct implant subcutaneously nude mouse . Histological analysis show round elongate cell appearance positive Alcian blue stain cartilage matrix formation construct . However , cell fibrin glue condense like MSCs pellet culture . Immunohistochemical stain abundantly positive type II collagen neo-cartilage region cartilage fragment-fibrin glue-MSC construct , construct without cartilage fragment negative stain type II collagen . The gene expression type II collagen construct 60 mg fragment significantly elevate 4 week implantation . Conversely , construct without cartilage fragment fail express type II collagen , indicate MSCs could differentiate chondrogenic lineage . In conclusion , demonstrated effect osteoarthritic cartilage matrix promote chondrogenic differentiation MSCs . This favorable method without exogenous growth factor induction .</detailed_description>
