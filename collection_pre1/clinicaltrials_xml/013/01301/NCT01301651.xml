	<brief_summary>Background Objective : Postural instability common patient Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . The purpose study investigate effect virtual reality ( VR ) balance train sensory cognitive domain postural control . Setting : Balance Performance Laboratory . Participants : A total 42 patient ( Hoehn Yahr stage II-III ) recruit assigned three group randomly . Intervention : Participants virtual reality ( VR ) group conventional balance training ( CB ) group receive 6 week balance training program . The control group ( CG ) receive training . Outcome Measures : The sensory organization test ( SOT ) computerize dynamic posturography single dual task ( i.e . backward subtraction number ) examine pre- , post-training follow-up . The equilibrium score ( ES ) sensory ratio measure . The verbal reaction time ( VRT ) record . Results : ( 1 ) Only VR significantly increase ES SOT-6 ( i.e. , vestibular function visual somatosensory conflict condition ) post-training CG post-training either single dual task . ( 2 ) Only CB train significantly increase SOT-5 ( i.e. , vestibular function without visual conflict ) vestibular sensory ratio ( i.e. , SOT-5/SOT-1 ) CG post-training either single dual task . ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Neither VR CB training reduce VRT significantly six sensory condition post-training follow-up . Conclusion : Both VR training CB training improve sensory organization postural control enhance utilization vestibular information , VR could enhance vestibular function conflict proprioceptive visual information single dual task patient mild moderate PD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It common people diagnosed idiopathic Parkinson disease ( PD ) experience postural instability daily activities.Recently , postural instability suggest underlying mechanism fall patient PD . Therefore , improve postural stability balance training important issue patient . Basal ganglion regard predominantly involve postural control . Several study suggest dysfunction basal ganglia patient PD might play major role postural instability . Furthermore , patient PD might impair utilization sensory information basal ganglia.Computerized dynamic posturography ( CDP ) Sensory Organization Test ( SOT ) , provide objective assessment main sensory system ( i.e. , vision , proprioception vestibular system ) involve balance stability . The role sensory information six condition ( i.e. , eye open , eye close , sway vision , eye open sway support , eye close sway support , sway vision sway support ) study patient PD SOT computerize CDP . Their study indicate patient PD demonstrate significant reduction sensory integration proprioception vision , significant difference vestibular function , compare age-matched control . One study show patient PD visual dependence adaptive strategy partly compensate impaired proprioception . However , study suggest cerebellum might important sensory integration patient PD .</detailed_description>
