	<detailed_description>Subjects sign informed consent eligible study irradiate back evaluate individual minimal erythema dose ( MED ) . A training session ( without study medication ) perform order introduce subject test rating procedure . Subjects come within 28 day screen start treatment period study . For eligible subject , three test area orient along long axis back different area MED determination define evaluation effect pain inflammation induce UVR . The three area irradiate 2 MED . In addition , non-irradiated , treated area serve reference training area individual visit . Topical treatment randomly assign three test area .</detailed_description>
