	<detailed_description>Title : Comparison pre-induction cervical ripening use Prepidil gel administer urinary balloon catheter Precis- This study design assess effectiveness combination method induction labor use urinary balloon catheter prostaglandin gel . Background Induction labor common intervention pregnancy1 . The frequency hospital admission induction labor increase United States . Indications induction labor include maternal disease , fetal complication social/geographical issue . Obstetricians may also choose elective induction , facilitate delivery term physician patient medical indication delivery . The vaginal delivery rate medical induction labor lower vaginal delivery rate spontaneous labor . As consequence , frequency cesarean section fail induction United States rising2 . This lead renew effort examine effectiveness vary method induction3-5 . The vaginal delivery rate induction labor predict assess patient 's cervical examination prior induction . The Bishop Score use cervical examination component predict vaginal delivery rate particular patient . A low poor Bishop score predicts low success rate vaginal delivery . There 3 common method use induce labor . The first physiological method break patient 's water causing contraction nipple stimulation . Breaking patient 's water require high ( favorable ) Bishop Score safely perform low ( poor ) Bishop score . This method high success rate patient prior vaginal delivery . Nipple stimulation associate increase risk tachysystole ( frequent contraction ) non-reassuring fetal heart rate pattern . It consider acceptable method induction United States . Physical method include pre-induction cervical ripening laminaria urinary balloon catheter6 . Both method design force cervix open mechanically . Laminaria small stick dehydrate seaweed place cervical canal . As stick hydrate , cervical canal dilates . Balloon urinary catheter insert cervical canal . The balloon inflate low uterine segment . A weight place catheter apply traction force fluid-filled balloon dilate cervical canal . Urinary balloon catheter use alone7,8 , saline infusion9-11 prostaglandin infusion12-16 . Pharmacological method include ergot alkaloid , prostaglandin E F series oxytocin . Ergot alkaloid cause forceful uterine contraction use treat postpartum hemorrhage . Ergot alkaloid may cause severe hypertension induction labor use United States . Prostaglandin E F series cause increase uterine muscle tone ( tonic contraction ) . They use pre-induction cervical ripening . The different prostaglandin vary complication may include nausea , vomit , diarrhea fever . Use misoprostol pre-induction cervical ripening associate increase risk uterine rupture normal patient patient previous cesarean sections17 . The method drug delivery prostaglandin medication vary . It administer oral tablet , vaginal suppository , vaginal gel , infusion low uterine segment via urinary balloon catheter . It unclear , base evidence-based medicine , whether particular method delivery superior another . The Food Drug Administration United States ( FDA ) approve use Prepidil gel ( prostaglandin E2 ) pre-induction cervical ripening18,19 . Prepidil gel administer gel vaginal fornix use syringe . Oxytocin pituitary hormone use augment spontaneous labor induce labor . It result increase uterine tone ( tonic contraction ) increase contraction frequency ( clonic contraction ) . It consider physiologic method pre-induction cervical ripening . Oxytocin administer intravenous infusion . Methods induction use individually combination . The common combination method induction labor use prostaglandin pre-induction cervical ripening follow oxytocin . Objectives- The current study randomize , unblinded trial urinary balloon catheter prostaglandin gel induction labor term pregnant patient . The primary outcome study vaginal delivery rate urinary balloon catheter alone , prostaglandin gel alone combination urinary balloon catheter prostaglandin gel . Secondary outcome study include safety method , composite maternal morbidity composite neonatal morbidity . The null hypothesis difference vaginal delivery rate three study protocol . Study Design Methods- Pregnant woman present Palmetto Health Richland schedule induction labor offer enrollment trial . Eligible patient undergo interview investigator . Enrollment pre-requisites exclusion review patient . The patient also provide write information regard safety prepidil pre-induction cervical ripening agent safety urinary balloon catheter pre-induction cervical ripening agent . The investigator review general information trial inform consent . Patients decline enrollment trial method pre-induction cervical ripening chosen physician . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Single , live fetus 2 . Cephalic ( head-first ) presentation 3 . Reassuring fetal health assessment 4 . Gestational age 26 42 week 5 . Maternal age 18 6 . Bishop score less 5 Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Multiple Gestation ( twin , triplet , quadruplet ) 2 . Fetal demise 3 . Fetal malpresentation 4 . Estimated fetal weight le 500 gram 4000 gram 5 . Placenta previa 6 . Non-reassuring fetal health assessment 7 . Maternal asthma 8 . Latex allergy 9 . Spontaneous labor 10 . Other contraindication vaginal delivery Patients enroll study randomize 3 study arm : urinary balloon catheter , prostaglandin gel combination urinary balloon catheter prostaglandin gel . Randomization make choose seal envelope lock nurse medication storage area ( Pyxis ) locate Labor Delivery Palmetto Health Richland . Randomization 1:1:1 randomization envelope prepare statistician University South Carolina Arnold School Public Health . The investigator give next sequentially numbered study envelope patient 's nurse . The randomization include unblinded patient physician . URINARY BALLLOON CATHETER ONLY ARM The patient place lithotomy position , either bed stirrup . A baseline digital exam cervix perform physician Bishop score record . A urinary balloon catheter place cervix low uterine segment , either digitally aid speculum . Once catheter properly position , bulb inflate 40ml normal saline . The urinary balloon catheter secure patient 's thigh use tape . The catheter place traction attach liter bag saline . The catheter deflate remove 6 hour , time removal record medical record . If catheter spontaneously expel uterus , time expulsion note nurse . Six ( 6 ) hour insertion catheter , physician perform digital cervical exam Bishop score record . If patient active labor time catheter removal expulsion , standardize protocol oxytocin commence . Labor management discretion physician . Artificial rupture membrane may also carry physician 's discretion . PREPIDIL ONLY ARM The patient place lithotomy position , either bed stirrup . A baseline digital exam cervix perform physician Bishop score record medical record . Prepidil gel insert vaginal fornix accord manufacturer 's direction . No oxytocin intervention commence 6 hour insertion gel . Six ( 6 ) hour insertion gel , physician perform digital cervical exam Bishop score record . If patient active labor 6 hour administration Prepidil gel , standardize protocol oxytocin commence . Labor management discretion physician . Artificial rupture membrane may also carry physician 's discretion . COMBINED URINARY BALLOON CATHETER AND PREPIDIL GEL ARM The patient place lithotomy position , either bed stirrup . A baseline digital exam cervix perform physician Bishop score record . A urinary balloon catheter place cervix low uterine segment , either digitally aid speculum . Once catheter properly position , bulb inflate 40ml normal saline . The urinary balloon catheter secure patient 's thigh use tape . The catheter place traction attach liter bag saline . Prepidil gel insert urinary balloon catheter low uterine segment , dose equivalent manufacturer 's recommendation . No oxytocin intervention commence 6 hour insertion catheter prepidil gel ( even catheter spontaneously expel prior time ) . Six ( 6 ) hour insertion catheter gel , physician perform digital cervical exam Bishop score record . The catheter deflate remove 6 hour , time removal note nurse . If catheter spontaneously expel uterus , time expulsion note nurse . If patient active labor 6 hour insertion prepidil gel , standardize protocol oxytocin commence . Labor management discretion physician . Artificial rupture membrane may also carry physician 's discretion .</detailed_description>
