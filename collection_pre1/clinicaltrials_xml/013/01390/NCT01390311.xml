	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study effect safety add azacitidine ( 5-AzaC ) standard care ( Soc ) patient relapse acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) treat donor stem cell transplant . SoC include give infusion donor 's white blood cell ( donor lymphocyte infusion DLI ) boost anticancer effect transplant . Giving 5-AzaC DLI may alter function T-cells resulting reduce incidence graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) maintain anticancer effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine After Chemotherapy Donor Lymphocyte Infusion Patients With Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome Previously Treated With Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : -To determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) 5-AzaC ( azacitidine ) give chemotherapy DLI patient AML/MDS relapse allogeneic stem cell transplant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To determine rate Grades II-IV III-IV acute GVHD ( aGVHD ) first 100 day DLI . - To determine rate complete remission ( CR ) , partial remission , ( PR ) complete remission incomplete count recovery ( CRi ) , overall response rate ( CR+ CRi + PR ) . - To determine overall survival 100 day DLI . - To determine effect increase dose 5-AzaC frequency absolute number rest regulatory T-cells ( rTregs ) activate Tregs ( aTregs ) baseline , 7 day , 14 day , 21 day , ~60 day first dose 5-AzaC .</detailed_description>
