	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods : Bipolar Depressed Subjects : The Bipolar Depressed group consist 10 subject ( purpose study would like able recruit 30 subject , goal get 10 complete protocol ) , age 55-89 , meet DSM IV-TR criterion bipolar disorder , current episode depress , depression severity rat MADRS Clinical Global Impression severity scale ( CGI ) . The Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) use ass concomitant manic symptom neuropsychological measure assess cognitive status . Subjects current previous Axis I disorder diagnosis Bipolar Disorder , include dementia , unstable medical illness contraindication magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) exclude . Subjects may concurrently prescribe psychotropic medication , dosage must unchanged one week prior study entry subject must willing continue medication study . All subject must able provide write informed consent . Furthermore , subject ask complete demographic information form . Recruitment take place referral McLean Hospital Geriatric Psychiatry Inpatient Service , Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Program : SAGE ( Seniors Aging Gracefully Everyday ) Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic , inpatient , partial outpatient psychiatric program McLean Hospital , Cambridge Health Alliance , local geriatrician , Harvard Division Aging , local retirement community , community psychiatrist , Partners Community Health Care PCP 's , Massachusetts General Hospital Brigham Women 's PCP network similar external program , well radio internet advertisement . We obtain permission director Inpatient Service ( Older Adult Unit ) Geriatric Psychiatry Outpatient Program ( SAGE Program ) research assistant look patient chart identity eligible subject . Once potential subject identify , study staff discus possibility study participation patient 's doctor see study would appropriate . If doctor agree patient 's eligibility , doctor discus study patient refer patient interested participate member study staff . Inclusion Criteria : - 55 year old - Meet DSM-IV diagnostic criterion Bipolar Disorder , Current Episode Depressed - Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) Score &gt; 20 - If MADRS score &lt; 20 &gt; 16 , diagnosis bipolar disorder , current episode depress , base Structured Clinical Interview DSM IV TR ( SCID ) Dr. Forester 's initial interview would allow subject include study . - Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) Score &lt; 6 - If YMRS score &gt; 6 subject still admit subject meet clinical criterion mania hypomania time screen - Able provide inform consent - Must speak English - Must able visit McLean Hospital screen visit three-four study visit 4-5 week duration study - Subjects may take medication bipolar depression include antidepressant , mood stabilizer antipsychotic medication prior Co-Q10 therapy , encourage dosage adjustment medication week Co-Q10 add throughout participation 4-week study . Changes concomitant medication time screen baseline visit 4-week study due clinical need allow . All concomitant medication change note study document . Exclusion Criteria ( bipolar disorder subject control ) : - Serious unstable medical illness , include cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , respiratory , endocrine , neurologic hematologic disease - History seizure disorder , - History current diagnosis follow psychiatric illness : organic mental disorder ( include dementia ) , schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , delusional disorder , psychotic disorder otherwise specify , unipolar major depressive disorder , patient substance dependence disorder , include alcohol , active within last 12 month . - History drug hypersensitivity intolerance Coenzyme Q10 . - Current treatment barbiturate . - Benzodiazepines , non-benzodiazepine sedative hypnotic ( zolpidem ( Ambien ) , may use subject throughout study long take within 12 hour MRI scan . - Subjects diagnose mitochondrial disorder . - Subjects take putative mitochondrial enhancer ( e.g. , vitamin E , carnitine , creatine , Vitamin complex B , pramipexole ) time study entry . - Subjects either metal object body work metal tool could leave small piece metal eye skin exclude study unsafe MRI scan . - Women pregnant try become pregnant participation study . Bipolar Subject Protocol Summary : This study 4 week long , consist 4 visit hospital . After initial phone screening , subject come baseline visit meet psychiatrist ass past current psychiatric medical history . Subjects also administer follow mood rating scale : MADRS ( Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) , CGI ( Clinical Global Impressions Scale ) , YMRS ( Young Mania Rating Scale ) , GDS ( Geriatric Depression Scale ) , neuropsychological measure . If subject fatigue , schedule permit , screen procedure may split two visit occur within one week . Within 7 day screen visit , subject come baseline visit 60 minute long 4.0T MRS scan . , The baseline screen visit take place start CoQ10 . Subjects schedule 3T MRI scan diagnostic purpose soon possible ; however , scan take place point study . In addition , obtain Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) , functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) Diffusion Tensor Imaging study 3T MRI scan obtain information specific nerve cell tract network within brain . During fMRI portion scan ask perform task ; rather ask lay still eye open breathe normally . For portion scan restriction close eye . After baseline visit , subject start take CQ10 ( dose schedule page 13 ) next 4 week . Subjects come week 2 follow-up evaluation Dr. Forester administer MADRS , CGI , YMRS . At week 2 , subject another 4T scan , last 60 minute . At week 4 , subject third 60 minute long 4T MRI scan re-administered MADRS , CGI , YMRS , GDS neuropsychological test ( week 4 procedure may split two visit , within week , subject become fatigued , schedule permit ) . The Wisconsin Card Sort Test Wechsler Test Adult Reading ( WTAR ) administer baseline visit administer subject last follow-up visit . The study doctor monitor response treatment change psychiatric clinical symptom course 4 week treatment CoQ10 . If time study clinical change warrant clinical assessment study subject 's primary clinician , study principal investigator refer subject primary care clinician and/or psychiatrist clinically need . Additionally , interest standardize instrument measure side effect , would like include Frequency Intensity Side Effects Ratings scale ( FISER ) , 3-item self-rated measure medication side effect study . The principal investigator continue monitor side effect clinical interview . Control Subjects : The control group consist 10 subject ( purpose study would like able recruit 30 subject , goal get 10 complete protocol ) , age 55-89 , ( match BPD group age ) without know psychiatric disorder , unstable medical illness contraindication MRI . A board certify geriatric psychiatrist ass control subject current past psychiatric disorder . Control subject evidence current past psychiatric disorder exclude study . The Control Group recruit contact Harvard Division Aging , local retirement community advertisement internet , senior/city newspaper , senior center . Dr. Forester may also conduct in-service talk local assist living community . Control subject meet following condition : Inclusion Criteria : - 55 year old - Able provide inform consent - Must speak English - Women enter study must post-menopausal . Exclusion Criteria : Same criterion Bipolar Depressed group exception `` first episode mania '' applicable . Control Subject Protocol Control subject ( N=10 ) consent initial screen visit . The control subject give CoQ10 . Otherwise , control subject follow protocol bipolar depress subject screen visit undergo psychiatric evaluation , implementation rating scale MRIs ) bipolar depressed subject ( see ) . The SCID clinical lab necessary component control protocol . Dr. Forester ass current past psychiatric symptom diagnose standard clinical psychiatric interview . Approximately 1 week screen visit , control subject schedule undergo 4T MRS scan . The mood measure ( MADRS YMRS ) re-administered subject visit . The 3T MRI scan schedule soon possible may schedule point subject 's participation study . Control subject return 2 4 week baseline 4T visit repeat scan use protocol . Control subject total three 4T MRS scan ( baseline visit 2 4-week follow-up visit ) . The mood rating scale re-administered week 2 visit . Additionally , mood measure neuropsychological test re-administered week 4 visit . Control subject also ask complete demographic information clinical history form .</detailed_description>
