	<brief_title>Renal Denervation Patients With Uncontrolled Hypertension Chinese</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevalence hypertension increase China.While actually , controlled rate hypertension relatively low , though numerous safe effective pharmacological therapy use clinical practice.Studies confirm renal sympathetic nerve contribute development perpetuation hypertension . Previous study state renal denervation effective safe patient resistant hypertension , little data know Chinese patient . We hypothesis renal denervation effective safe treatment Chinese patient uncontrolled hypertension . This trial plan recruit 100 patient ( Ablation group VS Control group = 1:1 ) follow duration 3 years.Patients ablation group receive percutaneous renal denervation combine necessary antihypertension drug patient control group receive appropriate antihypertension drug . We aim explore long term safety validity renal denervation Chinese patient uncontrolled hypertension .</detailed_description>
