	<brief_title>A Study Pharmacokinetics Safety MK-8808 ( MK-8808-002 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Part A base study , participant randomize either MK-8808 MabThera® . In Part B base study , participant randomize either MK-8808 , MabThera® , Rituxan® . Participants enrol Part A eligible participate Part B . In Parts A B , participant receive one two course therapy , course include two infusion study drug . The extension portion study ( Part C ) sequentially follow base study begin Week 52 continue additional 54 week . All participant meet eligibility criterion continue study extension treat open-label MK-8808 . Participants randomize MK-8808 base study remain therapy . Participants randomize rituximab ( MabThera® Rituxan® ) base study switch MK-8808 extension study .</detailed_description>
