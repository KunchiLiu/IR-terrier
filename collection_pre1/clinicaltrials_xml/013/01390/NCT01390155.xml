	<detailed_description>Background Heart rhythm disorder frequently occur general population potentially serious consequence . Atrial fibrillation , common atrial arrhythmia , lead intracardiac blood clot formation subsequent embolisation . Esophageal electrocardiography ( eECG ) provide detailed information electrical activity atrium . Due good signal quality , eECG promise technique rhythm monitoring . Patients undergo rhythm monitoring may also show sign cardiac disease , particularly coronary artery disease ( CAD ) due high prevalence . It therefore mandatory define ischemic change esophageal ECG . In CAD atherosclerotic process narrow lumen coronary artery may cause exercise-induced ischemia ( stable CAD ) . More importantly , also risk plaque rupture subsequent blood clot formation . This cascade lead total occlusion coronary vessel myocardial infarction . Coronary angiography use determine severity coronary artery stenosis . This simple approach turn useful clinical routine . However , presence absence coronary collateral one reason coronary angiography alone may fail define clinical relevance CAD . Collateral vessels natural bypass grow act `` backup '' blood supply myocardial area risk therefore reduce infarct size . The coronary wedge-pressure method recognize scientific clinical gold standard . Collateralization important confounder also `` mask '' ischemic change ECG . The surface ECG important portion patient undergo arrhythmia screening also show sign myocardial ischemia due CAD leave ventricular hypertrophy . As surface ECG , conceivable ischemic change occur eECG . The characterization ischemia relate change eECG crucial order guarantee proper classification eECG event . To date , characterization change adequate order allow reliable clinical interpretation eECG change . Objective - To characterize change esophageal ECG induce myocardial ischemia due short-time coronary occlusion . - To determine influence coronary collateral vessel change . Methods Patients refer elective coronary angiography randomize four group : 1 . Patients undergo temporary myocardial ischemia produce one-minute balloon occlusion proximal leave anterior descending ( LAD ) coronary artery . 2 . Patients undergo temporary myocardial ischemia produce one-minute balloon occlusion proximal leave circumflex artery . 3 . Patients undergo temporary myocardial ischemia produce one-minute balloon occlusion proximal right coronary artery . 4 . Patients undergo temporary ischemia produce one-minute occlusion target vessel ( vessel show significant stenosis accordingly require therapeutical intervention ) . During occlusion , collateral flow index calculate . Simultaneously , surface ECG , esophageal ECG intracoronary ECG register .</detailed_description>
