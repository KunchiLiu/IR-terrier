	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory infection lead cause hospitalization premature infant worldwide . Severity rate particularly high develop country . Numerous virus cause severe disease , frequent agent hospitalization respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) . In recent study Argentina , 58 % RSV infect VLBW infant require hospitalization 19 % required mechanical ventilation . One every twenty infect infant die . Unlike industrialized nation , VLBW infants develop country often lack access prophylaxis RSV commercially available monoclonal antibody ( palivizumab ) . No vaccine preventive intervention available respiratory virus infant young 6 month age develop country public sector middle-income country . The protective role breastfeed respiratory infection develop country well establish . But similar beneficial effect describe premature infant , dropout rate breastfeed family expose uncertainty stress early month life neonatal intensive care unit high . The World Health Organization recommend use Human Milk Donor Banks fee infant breastfed mother . These bank establish purpose collecting , screen , processing ( include pasteurize ) , test distribute donate human milk . The potential benefit donate milk acute disease elicit RSV unknown . The investigator propose study role supplemental donate human milk prevention hospitalization cause RSV non-breastfeeding premature infant . Since investigator expect benefit breast milk extend beyond protection RSV , effect human milk respiratory infection elicit virus also evaluate .</brief_summary>
