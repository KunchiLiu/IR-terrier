	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Olaparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Olaparib may help temozolomide kill tumor cell make tumor cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose olaparib temozolomide treat patient relapse glioblastoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether olaparib cross blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) achieve tumor penetration patient relapse glioblastoma . ( Stage 1 ) - To determine safety tolerability combination olaparib temozolomide patient relapse glioblastoma . ( Stage 2 ) Secondary - To assess BBB disruption BBB permeability patient relapse glioblastoma . ( Stage 1 stage 2 maximum-tolerated dose [ MTD ] expansion cohort ) - To assess possible anti-tumor activity combination olaparib temozolomide patient relapse glioblastoma . ( Stage 2 ) Tertiary - To assess biological marker possible predictor olaparib efficacy patient glioblastoma . - To optimize technique measure DNA damage response PARP inhibition tumor tissue . - To determine plasma concentration olaparib time surgery patient glioblastoma . - To evaluate PARP inhibition time surgery peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . - Stage 1 : Patients receive fixed-dose oral olaparib twice daily 3 day prior resection receive dose oral olaparib morning resection . After surgical resection , patient receive standard care treatment . Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) scan assess disruption permeability blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) . Stage 1 complete proven olaparib cross BBB achieve tumour penetration glioblastoma patient . - Stage 2 : Patients receive escalate dos oral olaparib twice daily 3 day prior resection receive dose oral olaparib morning resection . After recovery surgery , patient receive oral olaparib twice daily oral temozolomide daily day 1-42 . Treatment repeat every 8 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may receive 3 additional course treatment absence disease progression . Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) establish , 10 patient treat MTD stage 2 MTD expansion cohort . These patient also undergo DCE-MRI DWI scan . All patient undergo blood collection periodically pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day monthly resolution study drug-related adverse event . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK .</detailed_description>
