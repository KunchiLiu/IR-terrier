	<brief_summary>The objective study assess safety effectiveness SENSIMED Triggerfish® ( TF ) device continuous record relative fluctuation intraocular pressure ( IOP ) . Safety assess record AEs 24 hour continuous TF recording . TF efficacy evaluate demonstrate TF ability detect : 1 . The known phenomenon increase IOP move wake state go bed , reflect pneumotonometer measurement 2 . Ocular Pulse frequency relative direct measurement Heart Rate ( HR ) . A screening visit one 24-hour IOP fluctuation record session plan patient . IOP fluctuation record session carry sleep unit . An ophthalmological examination eye do screen prior follow device record .</brief_summary>
