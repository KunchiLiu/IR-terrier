	<brief_title>A Study Assess AC220 Given Combination With Induction Consolidation Therapy Newly Diagnosed Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects receive escalate dos AC220 plus standard 7+3 cytarabine daunorubicin remission induction therapy . Subjects may receive 2 cycle induction therapy . Subjects complete response ( include complete remission ( CR ) incomplete hematologic recovery ) eligible receive 3 consolidation cycle . In consolidation subject receive AC220 plus high dose cytarabine . Subjects achieve composite Complete Remission ( CRc ) eligible receive AC220 alone 12 additional 28 day cycle . Subjects enrol successive gender balance cohort 6 subject ( least 3 must female ) determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Dose escalation decision make base dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) occur first remission induction cycle . Seven 14 day schedule evaluate . After MTD schedule establish , study open enroll 14 34 subject . Subjects receive AC220 induction consolidation MTD schedule establish . Stopping rule use evaluate safety current dose . If test dose level must stop , low dose may test . MTD also establish maintenance therapy .</detailed_description>
