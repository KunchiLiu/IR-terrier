	<brief_title>Cognitive Impact Paracetamol Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paracetamol impact cognitive process recently little studied literature present conflict result . Some author describe cognitive performance change ( Bradley Nicholson , 1987 ) recent study ( Ishida et al. , 2007 ) report interest performance improvement therapeutic dos paracetamol . This improved performance would use serotonergic pathway involved analgesic mechanism paracetamol investigator demonstrate laboratory previous work ( Pickering et al . 2006 , 2008 ) . However , non-therapeutic dose , instead , show deterioration memory process animal may link implication Cyclooxygenases COX-2 . Indeed , several study demonstrate ( Sharifzadeh et al . 2005 ; Teather et al. , 2005 ) anti COX-2 ( Celebrex ) cause animal deleterious effect memory , anti COX1 2 ( indomethacin ) anti COX1 ( piroxicam ) lead change . A dose-effect relationship therefore suggest animal . Furthermore , recent study healthy volunteer show paracetamol act pain also pain / stress society everyday life ( `` social pain `` ) ( deWall et al. , 2010 ) . By fMRI , psychologists show reduction `` social '' pain associate decrease neuronal activity brain region involve social process also involve pain process ( anterior cingulate cortex , anterior insula etc.. ) . They also show paracetamol know painkiller property may reduce painful feeling rejection shelve everyday life . The cognitive-emotional impact paracetamol even interesting investigator know metabolism could involve cannabinoids receptor , particularly CB1 hippocampus association cortex involve cognitive phenomenon . INSERM U766 team investigator belong propose follow sequence preclinical : 1 ) metabolism acetaminophen analgesic metabolite AM404 via FAAH enzyme , 2 ) AM404 act indirectly CB1 receptor , 3 ) strengthen bulbo spinal descending pathway endocannabinoid system , 4 ) involvement serotonergic receptor pain suppressor . This protocol follow pilot investigator complete ( HOP clinicaltrial.gov NCT01053650 , unpublished result yet ) investigator study impact 2g paracetamol healthy volunteer . The investigator show memory improvement , placebo group , possible conclude significant impact oral paracetamol . Thus , protocol allow u good understand paracetamol affect cognitive process , particularly vigilance , memory decision making . In addition , investigator build biological collection ass pharmacogenetic profile subject , secondary objective , correlate cognitive characteristic subject .</detailed_description>
