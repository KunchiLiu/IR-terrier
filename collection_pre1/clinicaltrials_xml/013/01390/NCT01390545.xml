	<brief_title>VELVET , Dose Range Finding Trial Veltuzumab Subjects With Moderate Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The trial comprise screen phase ( 4 12 week prior first administration veltuzumab ) , 4-week treatment phase ( week 1 4 ) , core phase week 4 week 24 , follow-up phase week 24 week 48 . The primary end-point , American College Rheumatology 20 ( ACR 20 ) response rate , evaluate week 24 . The objective trial : - To investigate efficacy , safety tolerability week 24 three different sc dose level humanize anti-CD20 antibody veltuzumab add-on treatment MTX compare MTX alone subject moderate severe RA - To evaluate durability clinical response safety veltuzumab 48 week - To identify dosage ( ) veltuzumab favourable benefit-risk profile evaluate subsequent phase II/III clinical program subject moderate severe RA . Current status trial : Following voluntary temporary halt VELVET dose range find trial , sponsor decide redesign protocol start new trial soon possible . All patient treat prior voluntary halt complete safety assessment . It decide terminate VELVET trial consequently recommence enrollment . In VELVET trial , total 11 patient receive trial medication prior voluntary temporary halt . No efficacy conclusion accord protocol drawn 11 patient treat . Based collected clinical data trial , clinical safety signal increase clinical safety risk observe date precludes continue clinical investigation veltuzumab .</detailed_description>
