	<brief_summary>The purpose study use data Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM ) device Self-Monitored Blood Glucose ( SMBG ) level determine best time test blood glucose level use SMBG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Glucose Monitoring Self-Monitored Blood Glucose Type 2 Therapy Matrix Definition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator propose employ CGM technology subject use insulin sensitizer , incretin mimetics potentiators , insulin secretagogues insulin identify minimum episodic data set closely mimics CGM data . Specifically , investigator propose employ blind CGM 2 week capture diurnal glucose pattern individual different therapeutic regimen . The investigator propose examine data determine whether specific pattern SMBG test derive data would provide information ( e.g. , detection hypoglycemia , measure glycemic exposure , variability stability ) possible rely solely current SMBG testing schedule . In preparation study investigator develop matrix use data collect previous study . The matrix summarize amount CGM data investigator currently possess indicate investigator lack sufficient data produce SMBG test schedule base CGM data . It determine 6 case need therapy group . An underlying question whether investigator fill matrix investigator discover common test pattern SMBG would provide sufficient information uncover myriad perturbation glucose pattern characterize type 2 diabetes . To assure investigator collect adequate monitoring data , investigator propose use Ambulatory Glucose Profile ( AGP ) analysis blind CGM data . This novel approach enable u answer question optimum time number SMBG test sufficient guide clinical decision .</detailed_description>
