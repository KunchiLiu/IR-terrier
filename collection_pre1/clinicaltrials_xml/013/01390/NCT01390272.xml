	<brief_title>Titrated Disease Management Patients With Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project Objectives : The investigator conduct two-arm 18-month randomized clinical trial patient pharmaceutically treat hypertension systolic BP control ( &gt; /=140 mmHg non-diabetic &gt; /=130 mmHg diabetic patient ) . The primary aim compare two treatment arms/strategies term impact systolic BP control : Arm 1 - An intervention arm use titrate disease management patient ' hypertension control , assess baseline , 6 12 month , use decide resource intensity strategy : 1 ) Medium/level 1 resource intensity strategy : registered nurse provide monthly tailor behavioral support telephone call + home BP monitoring ; 2 ) High/level 2 resource intensity strategy : pharmacist provide monthly tailor behavioral support telephone call + home BP monitoring + pharmacist-directed medication management ; 3 ) Booster ( low ) resource intensity strategy : license practice nurse ( LPN ) provide bi-monthly , non-tailored behavioral support telephone call patient whose systolic BP come control . Arm 2 - A control arm , LPN provide bi-monthly non-tailored behavioral support telephone call ( procedure booster ( low ) resource intensity strategy component titrate intervention ) .</detailed_description>
