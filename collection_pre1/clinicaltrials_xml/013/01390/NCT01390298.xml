	<detailed_description>Primary indication major joint surgery include limit joint function pain . Although joint replacement repair surgery usually remarkably effective , case pain function bad improve surgery . Chronic pain surgical procedure , e.g. , phantom limb pain extremity amputation , long recognize , recent investigation suggest chronic pain physical injury include major surgery uncommon . The purpose study provide preliminary data Program Project Grant National Institutes Health examine specific hypotheses regard identify patient risk chronic pain surgery probe mechanism may manipulate decrease risk . Methods : Patients undergo elective orthopedic surgery : unicompartmental knee replacement total knee replacement approach ask provide consent participate 6 month observation surgery . During time , participant alter usual treatment way ( i.e. , treatment algorithm alter study ) , complete diary survey instrument numerous interval . Objectives : 1 . To demonstrate feasibility conduct protocol clinical population . The execution study allow u identify expect enrollment rate , patient drop-out rate , threat accurate assessment course pain major joint surgery . 2 . To estimate individual variability pain trajectory time obtain effect size estimate factor predict pain trajectory . Interventions : The propose study prospective longitudinal observational study . All patient complete write informed consent . The following questionnaire complete : Daily Stress Inventory Multidimensional Pain Inventory Catastrophizing Scale Coping Strategies Questionnaire Center Epidemiological Studies Scale Depression Stait-Trait Anxiety Inventory Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale Pain Medication Attitudes Questionnaire Pain Disability Index Pain Locus Control Scale Pain Self-Efficacy Scale Marital adjustment test Job Satisfaction Survey Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia At Home Diary Assessments Each follow measure list program electronic diary ( iPod touch ) especially program current study use Pendragon Forms VI . All participant complete assessment sequence use one several method : A. Inpatient evaluation ( surgery discharge ) : Nursing staff inquire patient pain level use standard care method assessment tool ( e.g. , numerical rating scale 0 - 10 ) . B. Ecological Momentary assessment ( discharge day 14 ) : The diary program emit alarm three random time throughout 12-hour day ( i.e. , patient wake cycle ) . The patient 10 minute complete entry entry consider valid ( i.e. , wait 2 hour make entry capture random assignment assessment time ) . C. Once daily ( day 15 day 28 ) : The patient instruct complete diary entry end day , prior go sleep . D. Once weekly ( day 29 day 85 ) : The patient call home participate brief interview . E. Once monthly ( day 86 day 168 ) : The patient call home participate brief interview month . In addition , information postoperative care orthopedic surgery division record , include range joint motion functional limitation , , time routine postoperative clinic visit . The iPod touch return postoperative visit follow surgery . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure study self-reported pain intensity . To obtain estimate pain intensity , use McGill Pain Questionnaire - Short Form ( MPQ ) . This instrument extensively use ass pain wide variety setting , uniquely suit present study item complete post-operative setting well daily diary setting .</detailed_description>
