	<brief_summary>It know intravenous immunoglobulin induce hemolysis , mechanism know detail . The primary objective study investigate specificity antigen red blood cell patient chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) show sign clinically relevant hemolysis follow treatment intravenous immunoglobin Privigen® . The study explore potential mechanism hemolysis analysis specificity antibodies possibly involve . To distinguish clinically non-relevant hemolysis relevant intravascular hemolysis , independent adjudication committee perform patient sign hemolysis determine laboratory clinic . This study request post-marketing commitment study United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . By September 2014 , case clinically significant intravascular hemolysis find , FDA agree halt study analyze hemolysis-relevant endpoint use FDA criterion hemolysis addition analysis plan protocol . The study restart .</brief_summary>
