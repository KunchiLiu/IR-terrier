	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn image solution call 18F-PEG6-IPQA help find tumor use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . The safety solution solution process body also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study 18F-Fluoro-PEG6-IPQA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>18F-PEG6-IPQA solution design attracted tumor cell . The imaging solution small dose radiation add , may help doctor see cancer cell well image scan . This first study use 18F-PEG6-IPQA human . Study Imaging : If find eligible take part study , visit clinic Day 1 injection study solution PET scan . This imaging study perform FDA-cleared PET-CT scanner MD Anderson site , include Center Advanced Biomedical Imaging ( CABI ) . For 6 hour PET scan compute tomography ( CT ) scan , must eat drink anything except water . This call fasting . A small tube place arm receive injection 18F-PEG6-IPQA . After injection , scan begin immediately . You 3 PET scan session PET/CT scanner . Before PET scan , CT scan make sure right position PET scan . Each PET scan may last 1 hour . Each position CT scan take 5 minute . You 10 minute `` rest period '' PET scan . Study Visits : On Day 1 : - Before image solution inject , vital sign ECG rhythm strip collect . The study staff insert intravenous ( IV ) needle line arm . - Right injection study drug , blood ( 2 tablespoon total ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test one exist IV line . PK test measure amount study solution body different time point . Blood drawn 1 , 3 , 8 , 16 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 150 minute injection 18F-PEG6-IPQA total 9 draw . - About 30 minute injection , vital sign measure injection site check . - Urine collect 10 minute rest period scan completion 3-hour scanning period . - After scan complete ( 3 hour injection ) vital sign injection site check , ECG rhythm strip take . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine also collect routine test . On Days 2 7 : - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Your vital sign injection site check - You ask side effect may since injection . End-of-Study Visit : The end-of-study visit 14 day injection 18F-PEG6-IPQA imaging scan . The following test procedure perform : - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - The injection site check . - You ECG . Length Study : You study 14 day . You take study early intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . 18F-PEG6-IPQA FDA-approved commercially available use imaging scan . Its use study investigational . The scan perform 18F-PEG6-IPQA also consider investigational use planning future cancer treatment . Up 15 patient take part study . All participant enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
