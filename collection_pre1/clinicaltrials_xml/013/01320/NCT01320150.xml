	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) single common cause disability mid late life . About 27 million people United States suffer incurable process 10 million OA knee . Total knee replacement ( TKR ) reliable treatment option patient disable knee OA fail non-operative treatment ; 58 % surgery perform patient 65 year old . Despite overall success TKR case , persistent postsurgical pain ( PPP ) operate knee remain common often difficult treat postoperative outcome affect 13-20 % patient 6 month post-TKR , amount 65,000-100,000 patients/year USA . Important secondary outcome PPP restrict physical mobility poor quality life , especially old patient . Recent finding span pre- , intra- postoperative period suggest development PPP TKR multi-factorial process , comprise neurophysiologic psychosocial factor . Likely determinates include preoperative thermal pain sensitivity , anxiety , pain catastrophizing ; postoperative area secondary mechanical hyperalgesia hypoalgesia ( numbness ) . There already agreement intensity early ( acute ) postoperative pain one factor predict PPP . To date , study examine role risk factor isolation and/or within single domain , prospective study comprehensively evaluate interaction neurophysiologic psychosocial variable evolution PPP follow TKR . The lack information regard neurophysiologic pathway patient cognitive/affective state interact time follow otherwise successful TKR greatly undermine understanding PPP TKR . The propose project single-site , prospective study 300 OA patient age 18-85 yr undergo primary TKR . The study design identify factor pre- , intra- postoperative phase TKR contribute PPP 6 month . Specific risk factor select potentially modifiable , therefore may amenable intervention . Patients assess pre-surgery 6 month post surgery . The propose multi-factorial prospective approach investigate risk factor vital next step towards understand complex phenomenon PPP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overall Strategy : The primary aim application investigate relationship risk factor development persistent postoperative pain ( PPP ) 6 mo follow TKR , independently predictive mediate model . These risk factor preoperative thermal pain sensitivity , pain anxiety catastrophizing ; postoperative area secondary mechanical hyperalgesia hypoalgesia ( numbness ) pain intensity . PPP study define `` pain operate knee six month TKR , cause pain exclude report intensity 0-10 Numerical Response Scale ( NRS ) scale ≥4 '' . The study also evaluate relationship PPP incidence severity functional impairment . This single-site prospective clinical investigation 300 consent OA patient undergo primary , unilateral TKR .</detailed_description>
