	<brief_summary>Malignant biliary obstruction common clinical condition cause various malignancy . Currently , biliary stent implantation guide either fluoroscopy endoscopy become important method relieve malignant biliary obstruction . However , benefit survival patient palliation stent treatment limit therapeutic effect process tumor stent implantation . Encouraged success 125I esophageal stent esophageal carcinoma , novel biliary stent load 125I radioactive seed develop institute . After ex vivo vivo evaluation delivery system , investigator prospectively compare response treatment radiation biliary stent , versus conventional biliary SEMS patient malignant biliary obstruction .</brief_summary>
