	<brief_summary>Primary Aim test Hypothesis : Nutritional supplementation 960mg EPA three time day positively affect muscle function mass ( assessed muscle biopsy , assay cellular aerobic function DEXA scan ) inflammation ( measure cellular marker inflammation ) patient undergo resection colorectal cancer . The secondary aim evaluate aerobic performance assess cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPEX ) perioperative outcome patient colorectal cancer post surgical resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect EPA Aerobic Performance , Muscle , Quality Life Colorectal Cancer Surgery Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer well document cause weight loss cachexia ( 1 ) . An inflammatory process drive presence tumour , result reduce food intake ( 2 ) , increase metabolic output ( 3 ) loss skeletal muscle ( 1 ) . They reduce fitness feeling lethargy affect activity daily live quality life . The process explain well understood thought due diminish skeletal muscle mass performance . When cancer patient undergo surgery , trauma surgery , entail inflammatory process furthermore lead ( 4 ) . Reducing inflammatory insult would positively impact fitness , ability respond infection , affect length stay hospital , recovery surgery quality life follow surgery . Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) omega-3-fatty acid , derive fish oil commonly available nutritional supplement . It believe reduce inflammatory effect cancer trauma surgery , turn dampen catabolic effect cause skeletal muscle loss . Studies oesophageal cancer patient previously suggest EPA preserve lean muscle mass ( 5 ) . The investigator expect EPA cause less lean muscle loss improve aerobic performance . High dietary intake think health risk ( 6 ) EPA recently trialed infant milk formula adverse effect ( 7 ) . The investigator plan recruit patient colorectal clinic , due surgery colorectal cancer , give EPA placebo , 5 day prior surgery 21 day follow surgery . The investigator would like measure marker muscle function inflammation , muscle mass , exercise performance cardiopulmonary exercise testing , muscle biopsy muscle grip strength dynamometer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Colorectal cancer patient list open curative tumour resection mean : Right Hemi Colectomy , Left Hemicolectomy Anterior Resection , neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Aged 18 85 year old . Strenuous exercise 48 hour preoperative assessment . Intramuscular injection within 48 hour study day . Known peripheral neuropathy myopathy . Patients mobility problem , wheelchair bound suffer previous cerebrovascular accident residual impairment mobility . Patients major/ minor trauma ( Motor vehicle accident ground fall , firearm injury , drown , struck injury ) . Pregnant woman . Pregnancy test do begin study day . Patients without mental capacity give sign consent . Patients already take fishoil derive nutritional supplement . Patients impaired oral intake . Patients know metastatic disease . Patients neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior resection , may confound result . Patients laparoscopic procedure . Patients identified cardiorespiratory comorbidity consider unsuitable surgery : unstable angina , myocardial infarction within last 3 month , severe aortic stenosis , pulmonary hypertension , HOCM , acute myopericarditis , chronic heart failure New York Heart Association class 3 impaired leave ventricular ejection fraction ( le 43 % ) . Respiratory contraindication include severe COPD , emphysema , fibrosing alveolitis , Interstitial lung disease FEV1 le 1.5 .</criteria>
