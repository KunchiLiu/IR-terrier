	<brief_summary>An open-label , prospective , single-arm , multi-center phase IV clinical trial TarcevaTM single agent</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Experience Erlotinib Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advanced NSCLC remain largely fatal , positive impact chemotherapy limit intrinsic acquire resistance , manifest clinically early progression transient response . Current chemotherapy regimen limit efficacy magnitude survival benefit still modest , lead significant toxicity , many patient unable receive kind treatment , even first line set . There , therefore , great need provide patient less toxic agent novel targeted therapy , potential improve efficacy maintain good quality life little associated toxicity . TarcevaTM show benefit single agent pretreated patient progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy summarize section 1.2 minimal toxicity compare chemotherapy , also currently assess first line treatment advance NSCLC promise preliminary efficacy result . As previously describe , TarcevaTM recently show prolong survival large , randomized , placebo-controlled Phase III trial include 731 NSCLC patient longer candidate chemotherapy . This first far evidence definitive clinical benefit provide EGFR inhibitor cancer patient . TarcevaTM standard care second third line treatment lung cancer USA Europe . However , experience agent Middle Eastern population limit . The rationale program evaluate pattern TarcevaTM use patient advance ( inoperable stage III IV ) NSCLC fail standard treatment , patient receive systemic anticancer therapy , patient medically suitable chemotherapy ( e.g. , poor performance status ) . This also enable u study efficacy safety TarcevaTM population , may differences pharmacogenomic population previously study population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histological cytological document diagnosis inoperable , locally advanced , recurrent metastatic ( Stage IIIB Stage IV ) NSCLC . 2 . Patients must evidence disease measurable disease mandatory . 3 . 18 year age old . 4 . ECOG performance status 0 3 . 5 . Life expectancy least 12 week . 6 . Patients receive one two previous line systemic chemotherapy irrespective EGFR mutation status . 7 . No 2 prior chemotherapy regimens permissible . Patients must recover toxic effect least 34 week must elapse last dose prior registration ( 14 day vinorelbine vinca alkaloid gemcitabine ) . Patients , opinion investigator , fully recover surgery le 4 week may also consider study . Patients must recover ( CTC &lt; 1 ) acute toxicity previous therapy . 8 . Patients eligible receive Erlotinib ( TarcevaTM ) first line meet one follow criterion : 1 . Positive EGFR mutation test certified lab ( although EGFR test mandatory available ) . 2 . Poor performance status 3 3 . Severe co morbidity illness make patient candidate standard systemic chemotherapy . 9 . .Patient negative EGFR mutation still candidate 2nd 3rd line therapy ( although EGFR test mandatory available ) . 10 . Prior radiotherapy allow . 11 . Granulocyte count &gt; 1.5 x 109/L platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/L . 12 . Serum bilirubin must &lt; 1.5 upper limit normal ( ULN ) . 13 .

For female childbearing potential negative pregnancy test must obtain within 72 hour start therapy . Patients reproductive potential must use effective contraception . 17 . Signed Informed Consent participate study . 1 . Any unstable systemic disease ( include active infection , grade 4 hypertension , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , hepatic , renal metabolic disease ) . 2 . Prior therapy systemic antitumor therapy HER1/EGFR inhibitor ( small molecule monoclonal antibody therapy ) . 3 . Any malignancy within 5 year ( except adequately treat carcinoma situ cervix basal squamous cell skin cancer ) . 4 . Patients exclude brain metastasis spinal cord compression newly diagnose and/or yet definitively treat surgery and/or radiation ; previously diagnose treat CNS metastases spinal cord compression evidence stable disease ( clinically stable image ) least 2 month permit . 5 . Any significant ophthalmologic abnormality , especially severe dry eye syndrome , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , Sjogren syndrome , severe exposure keratitis disorder likely increase risk corneal epithelial lesion . The use contact lenses recommend study . The decision continue wear contact lens discuss patient 's treat Oncologist ophthalmologist . 6 .
