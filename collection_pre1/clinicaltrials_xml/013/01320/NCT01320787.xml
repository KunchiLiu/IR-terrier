	<brief_title>18-F-Fluoroacetate PET Imaging Agent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Solution : 18-F-fluoroacetate sodium design attract cell grow tumor . This imaging solution small dose radiation add , may help doctor `` see '' cancer cell possible spread body , scan . This first study use 18-F-fluoroacetate sodium human . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign image study date . The first group 6 participant receive small dose solution ( less one half regular PET scan tracer radioactivity ) . The late 2 group may receive dose solution large dose , large dose still would receive regular clinic PET scan procedure . Study Solution Administration PET Scans : On Day 1 , receive 18-F-fluoroacetate sodium vein 5 minute . You 3 PET scan PET/CT scanner . You lie PET scan . Each scanning period take 1 hour . You 20-minute rest period scan . Before PET scan , CT scan , call `` Scout View '' , check position machine . This take 5 minute . You may continue receive standard treatment regular doctor throughout entire time study . Study Visits : On Day 1 ( day injection image study ) : - You ECG , vital sign measure , injection site check 5 minute , 30 minute 2 ½ hour image solution inject . - You ask side effect . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon total ) drawn 9 time 2 ½ hour injection pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount image solution body different time point . - Urine also collect test amount radiation might absorb body . This collect 10 minute rest period . On Day 2 : - Your vital sign measure . - You ECG . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - The injection site check . - You ask side effect . On Day 7 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ECG . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - The injection site check . - You ask side effect . On Day 30 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You ECG . - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - The injection site check . - You ask side effect . Length Study : You active study day receive image 18-F-fluoroacetate sodium . You follow-up 30 day image . This investigational study . 18-F-fluoroacetate sodium FDA approve commercially available . At time , use research . The study scan also consider investigational used purpose , use plan cancer treatment . Up 18 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
