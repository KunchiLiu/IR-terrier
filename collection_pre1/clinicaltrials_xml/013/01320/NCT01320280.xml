	<detailed_description>This phase II study BIBW 2992 ( Afatinib ) patient hormone chemotherapy ( docetaxel ) refractory , HER2 overexpressing prostate cancer . The exploratory study follow two stage Gehan design . In first stage 29 patient treat . Additional patient recruit second stage depend number respond patient first step . Patients receive BIBW 2992 ( Afatinib ) orally dose 50 mg daily . Response therapy score accord PSA value ( Bubley criterion ) CT scan ( RECIST criterion ) . Patients see 2 4 week interval medical professional medication toxicity assessment physical examination . Disease evaluation occur baseline every 2 month thereafter . These evaluation include PSA test CT Scans ( appropriate ) .</detailed_description>
