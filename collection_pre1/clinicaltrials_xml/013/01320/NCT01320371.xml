	<brief_summary>The purpose prospective study determine barb suture efficient , comparable complication rate , clinical outcome , cosmesis outcome versus traditional knotted suture use closure primary total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) . Barbed suture associate improved closure efficiency safety TKA prior study . The investigator perform multicenter randomize control trial determine efficiency safety technology TKA . The investigator prospectively randomize 411 patient undergoing primary TKA either barb running ( n=191 ) knot interrupted suture closure ( n=203 ) . Closure time measure intraoperatively . Cost analysis base suture operate room time cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Standard Versus Barbed Sutures Primary Total Knee Arthroplasty .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) rate consistently rise recent year , demand expect increase 600 % next 20 year . Decreasing reimbursement available resource make tangible advance surgical efficiency outcomes essential meeting current future demand . Closure time may one best target push reduce operative time cost increase operative productivity . Optimizing lengthy , multilayered wound closure TKA promising mean improve efficiency outcome potentially decrease wound closure time , reduce postoperative wound complication , improve cosmetic outcome . Running knotless suture technique utilize barbed suture technology recently show reduce wound closure time total hip knee arthroplasty small , prospective , randomized clinical trial . Barbed suture technology also facilitate rapid closure soft-tissue repair plastic-surgery literature . Very study report use barbed suture technology multilayered closure orthopedics . As pilot study , investigator perform retrospective analysis consecutive cohort change barbed suture . The investigator believe publish slight improvement efficiency cost saving barb suture closure underestimate due retrospective nature pilot study investigator therefore elect proceed forward prospective randomize trial . Additionally , investigator pilot study find potential trend toward low wound complication barb suture want see would bear prospective randomize trial . The investigator hypothesize prospective study would show barbed suture would efficient , comparable complication rate , clinical outcome , cosmesis outcome versus traditional knotted suture use closure primary TKA . Specifically , investigator hypotheses follow : multilayered closure TKA barb suture would associate ( 1 ) short closure time ; ( 2 ) low cost ; ( 3 ) similar closure relate perioperative complication rate ; ( 4 ) similar Knee Society , cosmesis , patient satisfaction score compare standard knot suture closure .</detailed_description>
