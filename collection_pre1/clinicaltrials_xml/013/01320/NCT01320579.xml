	<detailed_description>This Phase II multi-centre , double-blinded , vehicle-controlled , repeated multiple dose , study evaluate dose response , safety , tolerability efficacy 2.5 % 5 % cis-UCA compare placebo , investigator-blinded compare safety , tolerability efficacy cis-UCA active comparator Protopic® 0.1 % patient moderate severe chronic atopic dermatitis treat 28 day . The primary objective compare efficacy two different dos cis-UCA ( 2.5 % 5 % ) placebo 28 day adult patient moderate severe chronic atopic dermatitis determine dose cis-UCA clinical development . Secondary objective follow : - To evaluate safety tolerability cis-UCA topical twice daily dose 2.5 % 5 % 28 day adult patient moderate severe chronic atopic dermatitis . - To evaluate dose response topical twice daily dos 2.5 % 5 % 28 day adult subject moderate severe chronic atopic dermatitis . - To compare efficacy safety 2.5 % 5 % cis-UCA efficacy safety 0.1 % Protopic® topical twice daily dos 28 day adult patient moderate severe chronic atopic dermatitis The key eligibility criterion follow : patient moderate severe chronic atopic dermatitis , least 18 year age , current treatment atopic dermatitis active systemic medication active topical treatment plan investigational area , history significant disease would affect use cis-UCA comparator . In total , 150 adult patient ( male female ; least 20 % gender ) moderate severe chronic atopic dermatitis include study . Up 36 adult patient ( male female ) include treatment arm .</detailed_description>
