	<brief_summary>Heart failure major clinical problem increase magnitude cost management heart failure escalate . A significant part cost relate unplanned acute presentation emergency department hospitalisation worsen shortness breath due increase fluid content lung . Many heart failure patient already fit defibrillator protect risk fast heart rhythm sudden death follow heart failure clinic defibrillator clinic . Recently defibrillator fit equipped extra function detect warn change fluid content lung early even patient start complain shortness breath sign fluid overload see clinically . However , know deal warning occur early know whether medical intervention stage beneficial prevent progression eventual hospital admission . In majority case , early warning kind ignore function disable implantation device . The current study involve patient already fit device capability . The investigator use new function guide management patient compare outcome similar patient fit device without . The investigator attempt manage early warning predetermine increase medication group patient compare clinical course similar group action take .</brief_summary>
