	<brief_summary>Currently , many breast center patient positive family history receive information BRCA test breast cancer diagnosis , typically definitive breast surgery time point allow use test result make surgical decision . Diagnostics , decision intervention often sequence , result test information available time decision . Tests often repeat . Decisions intervention delay , understood breast cancer patient proceed without test information , result suboptimal care resource waste ( Donaldson MS. 2005 , Katz SJ 2007 , IOM 2001 ) . In study , BRCA test information deliver patient point breast imaging . For patient diagnose breast cancer , provide ample time use test result make surgical decision , elect test . The investigator work health care provider insure family history data collect breast imaging visit , develop standardized BRCA patient education handout , enlist health care provider insure information deliver appropriate patient population , coordinate schedule genetic counseling service insure patient promptly see . The investigator hypothesis intervention provide patient indicated genetic/familial risk timely information opportunity access genetic counseling breast image shift BRCA test definitive breast cancer surgery , patient breast cancer diagnosis , could impact surgical decision . The investigator identify barrier intervention perspective patient , physician , nurse , genetic counselor . The investigator adjust intervention overcome barrier test intervention point genetic/familial risk assessment base NCCN guideline ( ) conduct breast imaging . If indicate , patient provide information refer genetic counseling consider BRCA test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study expect involve total 2,101 individual : 89 ( 83 test intervention 6 participate interview like Northwestern staff participant ) breast cancer patient , 12 Northwestern staff , 2,000 woman consent participated genetics assessment screen survey use tool , sub-cohort 300 may benefit genetic assessment and/or test base screen tool result . All subject assign unique study number minimize risk breach confidentiality . This anticipated risk subject participate study utilize retrospective prospective chart review interview . TESTING THE INTERVENTION Investigators collect retrospective data 83 breast cancer patient diagnose underwent BRCA test definitive breast cancer surgery Northwestern 07/01/2008 06/30/2010 . This baseline information detail Data Collection Form collect use EDW NMFF NMH medical record system . The intervention involve radiologist convey pathology result patient suspect breast cancer . At time patient familial/ genetic risk inform positive test result breast cancer , radiologist provide information genetic counseling offer send educational handout via e-mail regular mail . This intervention conduct newly diagnose breast cancer patient 03/01/2011and 05/31/2012 . Investigators prospectively collect data 83 breast cancer patient diagnose , receive BRCA test , definitive surgery Northwestern time intervention , 03/01/2011 05/31/2012 . The EDW NMFF NMH medical record system use collect information . Because intervention retrospective prospective chart review pose minimal risk subject locate patient access patient would time cost prohibitive , waiver consent HIPAA request . ASSESS IMPACT OF THE INTERVENTION Study investigator conduct interview total 6 breast cancer patient 12 Northwestern staff determine intervention improve care process . Written consent obtain interview participant . Participants option audiotaped . Audiotaping require . - Prior intervention , investigator interview 6 breast cancer patient 12 Northwestern staff find current care process opinions/feedback propose intervention . - Following intervention , 6 patient 12 staff interview use question format . It acceptable individual participate post-intervention interview participate pre-intervention interview . INTERVENTION TEST/INTERVENTION IMPLEMENTATION The intervention test woman age 18 old history genetic/familial risk patient Lynn Sage Comprehensive Breast Center March 1 , 2013 February 28 , 2014 . There follow patient March 31 , 2014.. 1 . Select breast center patient consent participate study take basic familial/genetic risk survey follow NCCN guideline ( 2,000 patient consent study , sub-cohort 300 identify familial / genetic risk breast cancer . If risk identify , patient specifically inform genetic counseling . 2 . For study consent breast center patient familial / genetic risk , cancer genetics program provide information genetic counseling . The research staff track patient receive information genetic counseling .</detailed_description>
