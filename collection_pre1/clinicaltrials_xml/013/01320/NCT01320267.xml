	<brief_summary>The investigator document success complete laparoscopic resection cancer right colon use new single port access technique . The current procedure require 4 incision 4 separate port . With technological advancement newly design instrument possible laparoscopic procedure single port . The investigator want demonstrate British Columbia safe procedure similar success outcome compare standard 4-port laparoscopic operation . The investigator propose procedure may provide early discharge due less pain also associate less wound infection hernia complication . The single incision improve cosmesis compare standard 4-port standard laparoscopic procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study demonstrate single port right hemi-colectomy performed consistency . The second purpose ass single port surgery term length stay hospital , analgesic requirement , length scar 30 day . The single port surgery late advancement towards achieve minimal scar major abdominal surgery . Justification : Laparoscopic Colon resection well-documented standard practice many center throughout world . A Cochrane Review 25 Randomized Control Trials ( RCT ) publish 2005 look short term ( 30 Days ) benefit laparoscopic colorectal resection show good outcome intra-operative blood loss , intensity postoperative pain , postoperative hospital stay , duration postoperative ileus , pulmonary function ( 1 ) . Total morbidity local ( surgical ) morbidity decrease laparoscopic group . Until 30th postoperative day , quality life well laparoscopic patient . They conclude long-term oncological result laparoscopic conventional resection colonic carcinoma show equivalent result , laparoscopic approach prefer patient suitable approach colectomy . A Cochrane Review publish 2008 look 33 RCT 's compare laparoscopic/Laparoscopic-assisted open colectomy colo-rectal carcinoma find similar long-term oncologic outcome group ( 2 ) . Single Incision Laparoscopic Surgery ( SILS ) instead traditional 4 port theoretically may reduce wound complication . For cholecystectomy , blind randomize control study show significant reduction pain control sub-costal port-sites 2-port versus 4-port laparoscopic cholecystectomy also show similar pain umbilical port ( 3 ) . There report perform colectomy single port similar SILS cholecystectomy mention . Remzi et al publish report perform sigmoid-colectomy polyp use single umbilical tri-port system ( 4 ) . Merchant et al use single port ( time Gel-port ) perform SILS right hemicolectomy ( 5 ) . Bucher report case single incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy stenosis due endometriosis ( 6 ) . They question SILS colectomy offer benefit except cosmesis , compare standard laparoscopic surgery . The above-mentioned publication SILS colectomy use conventional conventional instrument ( curve and/or articulate forceps ) . The availability instrument due technical advancement open door procedure perform routinely . In recent study technique apply effectively perform comparable operative time traditional 3-port cholecystectomy learn curve approximately 5 case ( 7 ) . Recently Dixon et al . ( 8 ) demonstrate perform variety colo-rectal procedure use single port laparoscopic technique . They perform , right hemi-colectomy , extend right hemi-colectomy , total colectomy ileo-anal anastomosis , procto-colectomy , restorative procto-colectomy ileo-anal pouch formation anterior resection . Two procedure cancer . All operation perform use single incision tri-port system harmonic scalpel , linear/circular stapler standard laparoscopic instrument . Methods : The investigator assess short-term outcome variable single incision laparoscopic resection procedure pilot study 20 patient diagnose resectable right colon cancer . The investigator compare short term outcome variable aggregate group patient previously undergone standard 4-port laparoscopic resection right colon cancer 12-month period ( 2009 ) . The outcome variable : 1 . Successful completion right hemicolectomy 2 . Use additional port reason 3 . Conversion open procedure reason 4 . Duration surgery 5 . Operative complication 6 . Number total length surgical incision 7 . Postoperative analgesia requirement 8 . Postoperative complication 9 . Length postoperative hospital stay 10 . Cancer stage ( TNM ) 11 . Resection margin clearance 12 . Number lymph node assess Data collection : Data collect prospectively patient undergo single port laparoscopic resection . Data abstract retrospectively electronic hospital office chart patient previously standard laparoscopic resection right colon cancer . Statistical analysis : Demographic , operative postoperative data summarize reported count percent categorical variable Mean Â± Standard Deviation ( plus Median &amp; Min . Max . ) continuous variable . Outcomes two group compare independent sample t-tests non-parametric median test continuous variable Chi-square Fisher 's exact test categorical variable . Sample size : The pilot study sample size 20 chosen basis reasonable number patient recruit one year . The comparison group size patient previously standard laparoscopic resection choose convenience estimate approximately 20 patient .</detailed_description>
