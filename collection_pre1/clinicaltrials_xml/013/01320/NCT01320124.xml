	<brief_summary>A contracture pathological condition limit range function joint . Contractures large small joint alike affect one 's ability independently perform daily activity eat , dress walk . Current treatment contracture include physical stretching , use assistive device , rarely , surgery . Despite prolonged treatment , patient contractures rarely regain complete mobility . Progress prevent treat contracture possible understanding biological molecular process involve . Our group establish validate animal model study histological event molecular mechanism involve joint contracture . We provide evidence capsule stiffness , characterize cartilage degeneration , identify four gene whose expression alter cartilage knee joint contracture . The work propose current study aim find gene pathway joint capsule associate knee joint contracture . The result identify new avenue treat large number patient suffer contracture .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Creating Tissue Bank Knee Capsules</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose constitute bank capsule sample people osteoarthritis undergo primary total knee arthroplasty . It expect 1.3 % people develop contracture post arthroplasty . A second sample take require surgery release contracture revision . We study histological characteristic compare gene expression primary sample contracture sample patient . In order determine whether intrinsic genetic factor influence develpment joint contracture osteoarthritis population , specimens analyze differential gene expression patient without knee contracture post arthroplasty . The remain capsule tissue use study bank make available researcher .</detailed_description>
