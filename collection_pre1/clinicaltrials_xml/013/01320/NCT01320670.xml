	<brief_summary>Epilepsy , define recurrent , unprovoked seizure , common condition , affect 0.5-1 % general population . People uncontrolled epilepsy suffer poor health increase mortality due condition . They frequently experience social stigma socioeconomically disadvantage . It therefore imperative help gain control seizure quickly possible . A wide range antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) become available treat people epilepsy . However , despite maximal therapy , approximately 20-40 % show pharmacoresistance ( PR ) thus continue seizure . We understand significant proportion people epilepsy PR . For give patient present first unprovoked seizure , unable predict PR time presentation . At least 2 different AEDs must try maximum dos year diagnose PR . At point , surgical therapy become increasingly urgent consideration . Retrospective magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study chronic stage epilepsy show patient PR likely focal structural lesion brain , particular sign damage hippocampus . For example , retrospective data suggest decreased hippocampal N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) /creatine ratio ( measure magnetic resonance spectroscopy [ MRS ] ) hippocampal atrophy ( determine hippocampal volumetry ) correlate PR . However , clear whether finding reflect underlie pathophysiology PR , simply reflect effect chronic seizure chronic drug treatment brain . The First Seizure Clinic Halifax Infirmary represent unique opportunity prospective , longitudinal study patient present first seizure newly diagnose epilepsy . In patient , advance neuroimaging technique presentation might show change truly reflect underlie pathophysiology PR , rather change develop consequence prolonged seizure drug treatment . Neuroimaging follow-up might help u understand pathophysiologic change accompany evolution PR . Ultimately , hope combine neuroimaging feature clinical feature patient PR predictive model would help u predict PR presentation .</brief_summary>
