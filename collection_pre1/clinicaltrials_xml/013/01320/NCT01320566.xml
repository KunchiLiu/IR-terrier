	<detailed_description>Emphysema progressive , debilitate disease characterize destruction lung tissue result inflammation cause exposure noxious inhaled agent extend period . The common cause condition cigarette smoking , although genetic , occupational , environmental cause account 10 % case . Despite aggressive public health initiative aim discourage use cigarette , smoking-related lung disease remain significant cause disability death worldwide . Due number current new smoker , emphysema expect remain leading cause morbidity mortality year come . The AeriSeal System novel device system develop treatment advanced emphysema . The AeriSeal System administer bronchoscopically , design provide physiological benefit lung volume reduction without risk cost major surgery .</detailed_description>
