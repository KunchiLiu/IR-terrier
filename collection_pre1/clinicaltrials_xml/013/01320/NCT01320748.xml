Thus , implicit cognitive process play significant role drug use behavior , decrease self regulation capacity increase risk . Specifically , high level stress compromise prefrontal cortex functioning , nucleus accumbens , orbitofrontal cortex amygdala functional change relate increase cue reactivity . Taken together , current literature strongly suggest verbally-based therapy may limited utility singular form treatment early substance abuse recovery , brain may functionally ready executive level processing . Instead , multidisciplinary substance abuse literature suggest psychosocial treatment method need include range learning approach allow visual-sensory processing , addition traditional verbal-based processing . Integrated multi-modal intervention need offer opportunities activation different brain region facilitate cognitive-affective balance behavioral decision-making .</detailed_description>
