	<brief_summary>The prevalence rate intracranial aneurysm adult population close 5 % . Rupture risk aneurysm cause subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) substantial.Most patient suffer aneurysmal SAH mid life , i.e. , 30 60 year old . Aneurysmal SAH may cause disability mortality . The present study include follow-up study cross-sectional fMRI study . The purpose follow-up study monitor patient receive prophylactic surgical treatment un-ruptured aneurysm examine whether treatment associate cognitive , psychosocial and/or neurologic sequela . The purpose cross-sectional fMRI study examine relationship memory function brain activity among SAH patient . Memory impairment often find among aneurysmal SAH patient . Using fMRI possibly shed light whether memory impairment may cause diffuse cerebral damage focal damage aneurysm site .</brief_summary>
