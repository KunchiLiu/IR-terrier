	<brief_summary>The principal aim study demonstrate Rostafuroxin able induce pronounce reduction arterial blood pressure respect Losartan , hypertensive patient carry least one pre-specified gene mutation . In previous study demonstrate mutation able induce specific alteration induce increase sodium ( Na ) reabsorption renal tubular level increase arterial blood pressure . Pilot study demonstrate Rostafuroxin able reduce impact alteration , directly reverse increase blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antihypertensive Effect Rostafuroxin Compared With Losartan Hypertensive Patients Bearing Specified Gene Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 30 % world adult population affect hypertension industrialised country . Elevated arterial pressure major cause cardiovascular mortality international guideline emphasise benefit reduce blood pressure . The current antihypertensive strategy may reduce 20-30 % cardiovascular risk hypertensive patient efficacy measure clinical trial comparison placebo . A precise world-wide estimation efficacy term patient burden healthcare cost available ; however , recent analysis suggest world-wide cost hypertension associate cardiovascular complication around 1,000 billion dollar . Therefore , effective improvement diagnosis treatment hypertension provide significant contribution decrease cardiovascular mortality reduction world-wide cost associate treatment hypertension complication . Most clinical trial , perform aim show reduction systolic blood pressure hypertensive patient , show reduction systolic blood pressure independent class test drug diuretic , β blocker , Ca channel blocker inhibitor RAS seem roughly efficacy . These finding use argument support notion antihypertensive therapy efficacy reduce cardiovascular risk depend magnitude blood pressure fall rather mechanism action drug . This view contrast well establish notion secondary prevention capacity cardiovascular diseases differs among class drug minor difference prevention heart failure stroke Ca antagonist class drug . Furthermore , recent finding genetic hypertension take together previous data pathophysiology hypertension cardiovascular complication consistent notion variety heterogeneous genetic-molecular mechanism concur develop rather uniform clinical picture primary hypertension . Drugs small molecule produce effect interact large molecule ( protein ) whose function reactivity may vary one patient another variation within gene encode . Therefore , logical postulate consequence different interaction either term blood pressure reduction cardiovascular risk prevention may vary patient another accord peculiar function protein involve give patient . Rostafuroxin select research program aim synthesize select new antihypertensive compound able interfere abnormality Na tubular reabsorption due humoral and/or genetic mechanism lead essential ( genetic ) hypertension . Many study perform Milan hypertensive strain rat ( MHS ) , bear primary renal alteration ability excrete sodium increase blood pressure level , show clear capacity Rostafuroxin revert alteration , reduce systemic blood pressure . Rostafuroxin selectively interfere Na-K pump correct functional abnormality without interfere receptor involve blood pressure regulation hormonal homeostasis . At nanomolar concentration , rostafuroxin reduces Na-K pump hyperactivation induce renal cell culture either incubation nanomolar ouabain concentration cell transfection 'hypertensive ' variant adducin . Similarly , less 1 μg/kg o rostafuroxin able completely normalize blood pressure increase renal Na-K pump activity rat make hypertensive chronic infusion low-dose ouabain . The antihypertensive effect rostafuroxin long-lasting since still present 24 hour oral administration . It associate change heart rate . Moreover , long-term antihypertensive activity rostafuroxin associate alteration plasma potassium , RAAS , insulin resistance , plasma lipid profile uricemia . These finding indicate normalization renal sodium handle bring compound accompany typical side effect diuretic , : hypokaliemia , increase plasma level renin , aldosterone , triglyceride uric acid , insulin resistance . Increased level EO mutate adducin associate organ complication related hypertension , namely cardiac hypertrophy progression toward renal insufficiency . Cardiac renal hypertrophy induce rat chronic ouabain infusion . Rostafuroxin prevents ouabain-induced organ hypertrophy . Rostafuroxin show high safety ratio toxicological study well tolerate previous clinical trial . Patients mutate adducin increase EO plasma level share many functional , hormonal biochemical characteristic MHS rat , therefore Rostafuroxin could become first choice treatment patient bear specific gene mutation present high arterial blood pressure level . Preliminary proof concept study show ability Rostafuroxin reduce arterial blood pressure level patient .</detailed_description>
