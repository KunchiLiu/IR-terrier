	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess initial safety CA lung tumor less equal 3.5 cm size include acute toxicity ( 30 day ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate local control . II . To assess physical function cohort patient . III . To evaluate impact treatment generic disease-specific quality life . IV . To obtain pilot data useful design subsequent phase II randomize phase II trial . V. Evaluate change pulmonary function 3 month . OUTLINE : Patients undergo compute tomography ( CT ) -guided CA After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 week 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 month .</detailed_description>
