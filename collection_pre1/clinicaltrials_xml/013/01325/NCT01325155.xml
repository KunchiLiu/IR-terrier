	<detailed_description>The association exposure ambient air pollution pulmonary disease well establish . Recent study attempt investigate effect air pollution , specifically exposure PM 2.5 , cardiovascular outcome . Acute exposure PM 2.5 associate increased heart rate , decrease heart rate variability , increase incidence cardiac arrhythmia . Population base research United States Europe demonstrate increase rate emergency room visit , hospitalization cardiovascular morbidity association increase daily concentration fine particulate . To date study look burden cardiovascular disease Israel relation ambient air pollution . Standardized mortality ratio due cardiovascular disease significantly elevate Haifa Bay Area comparison rest country ; mortality due MI 13 % national average total ischemic heart disease mortality 29 % national average . The Haifa Bay Area long history industrialization include possess nation 's large oil refinery , oil-fired power plant , agrochemical cement producer , industrial incinerator Eastern Mediterranean 's busy port . The presence industrial mobile source , combine basin effect contribute air pollution Haifa Bay Area raise concern potential health effect . Research Hypothesis- Fine particulate variation Haifa Bay Area positively associate emergency room visit , hospitalization rate mortality rate secondary cardiovascular disease . Study Methodology- Critical environmental epidemiology research coordination expert exposure assessment health outcome . This study two year collaborative effort School Public Health University Haifa Faculty Civil Environmental Engineering Technion . Exposure measure come Haifa District Municipal Association Environment 's ( HDMAE ) network 15 monitoring station region . HDMAE also monitor number meteorological covariates ( ie . maximum minimum temperature , mean humidity , mean barometric pressure ) incorporate exposure modeling . Primary outcomes interest daily mortality rate daily rate cardiovascular related emergency room visit hospitalization Rambam Medical Center Haifa Israel . Electronic medical record databases query ICD-9 code related cardiac ( acute coronary syndrome , heart failure , dysrhythmia/conduction disturbance ) diagnose . A time-series analysis utilized ass change mortality emergency room visit rate relation incremental change PM2.5 . Covariates model include seasonal trend disease incidence , daily concentration co-pollutants , meteorological variable temperature humidity . Calculation relative risk incorporate 1 7 day lag model determine latency effect . Contribution Environmental Health Israel- This research hop evaluate contribution ambient air pollution increase rate cardiovascular morbidity Haifa Bay Area . In assess effect modification sub-groups contribute understanding environmental pollution impact Israel 's diverse population . In calculate economic impact associate morbidity mortality hope contribute cost-benefit analysis environmental regulation Israel . Finally , create prediction model daily cardiovascular emergency department visit base air pollution meteorlogical variation , potentially inform local medical facility public health agency predict prepare change disease incidence .</detailed_description>
