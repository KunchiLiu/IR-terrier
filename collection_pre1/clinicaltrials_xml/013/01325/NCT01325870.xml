	<brief_summary>More 300,000 Americans experience out-of-hospital cardiac arrest annually , overall survival rate average less 5 % . Low survival rate persist , part , manual chest compression ventilation , termed standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( S-CPR ) , inherently inefficient process , provide less 25 % normal blood flow heart brain . Hemodynamics often compromise poor S-CPR technique , especially inadequate chest compression incomplete chest recoil . Active Compression Decompression CPR ( ACD-CPR ) perform hand-held device attach patient 's chest , also include handle contain metronome force gauge guide proper compression rate , depth complete chest wall recoil . The impedance threshold device ( ITD ) design rapid connection airway adjunct ( e.g . facemask endotracheal tube ) allow positive pressure ventilation , also impede passive inspiratory gas exchange chest wall decompression . Prior study show combination ACD-CPR + ITD enhance refill heart compression augment negative intrathoracic pressure decompression phase CPR , result improved cardiac cerebral perfusion . The intrathoracic pressure regulator ( ITPR ) next generation inspiratory impedance therapy . The ITPR use regulate external vacuum source lower negative intrathoracic pressure therefore less dependent quality CPR ( e.g. , completeness chest wall recoil ) . The ITPR generate pre-set continuous control expiratory phase negative intrathoracic pressure interrupt positive pressure ventilation need maintain oxygenation provide gas exchange . The purpose study compare early safety hemodynamic effect S-CPR , ACD- CPR + ITD , S-CPR + ITPR patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Initial Subject initially presume know 18 year age old ; Subject present presume nontraumatic , outofhospital cardiac arrest AND candidate resuscitation attempt . [ NOTE : cardiac arrest may witness OR unwitnessed ] ; Subject secure cuffed advance airway [ e.g. , endotracheal tube , Combitube , King airway ] . Final Subject femoral arterial access successfully establish ; Subject remain cardiac arrest ( undergoing CPR ) time hemodynamic data acquisition ; Subject least 5 minute continuous hemodynamic data able collect , OR ROSC occur 5 minute , least 2 minute hemodynamic data able collect . Initial Subject know preexisting DNR order place prior cardiac arrest ; Subject sign obvious clinical death condition preclude use CPR ; Subject 's family legal guardian request subject enter study time arrest ; Subject recent sternotomy , wound appear completely heal ( date sternotomy unknown ) less six month ( date sternotomy know ) ; Subject stoma , tracheotomy , tracheostomy prior arrest ; Subject know suspect pregnant ; Subject known/suspected prisoner . Final Subject &lt; 2 minute hemodynamic data acquire receive CPR ; Subject arterial pressure catheter place arterial pressure able successfully monitor ; Subject subsequently find traumatic arrest ; Subject asystole time initial arrest AND remain asystole resuscitation effort AND arrest unwitnessed unknown witness .</criteria>
