	<brief_title>Injection CD4 CD8 + T Cells Anti-Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Anti-adenovirus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) adenoviruses infection major source morbidity mortality allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSC ) . Conventional antiviral therapy sometimes insufficient efficiency significant potential toxicity . Over last ten year , adoptive immunotherapy demonstrate efficiency treatment viral infection context . Different method use organizational technological barrier prevent wide use therapeutic approach . This protocol aim assess efficiency treatment injection donor CD4 + CD8 + T cell specifically direct cytomegalovirus adenovirus , patient receive allogenic transplant infection one two virus , conventional antiviral treatment failure . Donor memory T cell obtain aphaeresis mononuclear cell select basis ability produce interferon-gamma ( IFN-g ) stimulation viral peptide . The speed ( 48 hour ) reproducibility method let hope good feasibility clinical use compare previously develop technology . Given epidemiology different allogenic transplant HSC two virus , relative low expect number patient adenovirus infection , statistical analysis focus exclusively patient receive T cell CMV infection . The study efficiency tolerance adoptive immunotherapy adenovirus consider secondary purpose . This multicenter non-comparative phase I/II protocol , predict inclusion 30 patient 25 patient infected CMV , demonstrate efficiency 55 % minimum required efficiency 30 % , alpha risk 10 % strength 90 % . The main purpose study evaluate efficiency treatment level CMV viral replication 21 day first injection . A positive response define viral load become undetectable reduce least 2 log10 . A negative response define basis unchanged increase viral load injection T cell ; partial response define significant decrease ( great 0.3log10 copy / ml less 2 log10 ) viral load , still remain detection threshold . For patient isolated organ damage ( patient without PCR ) , positive response define heal affected organ . In case negative partial response 21 day first injection , second injection available programmed absence clinical sign graft versus host aggravation pre-existing GVHa . The secondary purpose : ) ass tolerance , term occurrence acute reaction graft versus host ( GVHa ) directly due injection T cell ; b ) evaluation indirect biological parameter efficiency inject T cell expansion study use tetramers specific secretion IFN-g ; c ) study efficiency tolerance immunotherapy adenovirus . Inclusion criterion concern child adult receive allogenic transplant HSC , donor CMV + active viral infection : 1 ) conventional antiviral treatment failure , persistent viral load and/or increase 15 day treatment CMV ADV disease organ damage document without systemic replication ( possible , CMV PCR ADV PCR positive organ ) , 2 ) intolerance toxicity situation treatment prevents pursuit . Donor T cell inject follow condition observe : 1 ) donor chimerism &gt; 10 % , 2 ) absence GvHa ≥ grade II 3 ) absence severe organ failure . The antiviral drug therapy may eventually continue jointly cellular immunotherapy . Number participate center : grafter center Ile-de-France Hospital Edouard HERRIOT Lyon , CHU Nantes , CHU Poitiers ( 10 center ) . The study duration 42 month , inclusion period 36 month follow-up period 6 month last inclusion . If study give expect result , compare phase III trial consider treatment CMV infection Phase I/II treatment adenoviral infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Child adult patient ( without age limit ) treat allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplant whatever underlying pathology donor chimerism ≥ 10 % , time inclusion : biological sign ( blood viral load ) associate clinical sign infection CMV / resistant intolerant Adenovirus ( myelotoxicity nephrotoxicity ) conventional antiviral treatment CMV ADV disease organ damage document without systemic replication ( possible , CMV PCR ADV PCR positive organ ) without GvHa time inclusion GvHa ≤ II control Corticoids &lt; 1mg / Kg ( corticosteroid decrease ) cyclosporine . A possible treatment monoclonal antibody anti rIL2 ( LEUCOTAC ) must interrupt least 8 day . The preventive treatment GvHa cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil compatible study answer eligibility criterion donor ( particular donor CMV positive serology absence intercurrent infection ) inform legal representative sign informed consent patient member benefit social security scheme donor CMV negative serology ( case antiCMV immunotherapy ) . Note : donor consider meet adenovirus status serology towards virus , check . GvHa &gt; II and/or require corticosteroid therapy &gt; 0,5 mg/kg/day and/or treatment monoclonal antibody antirIl2 could interrupt immunosuppressor treatment could potentially interfere survival injected T cell ( Thymoglobuline , Campath etc ) severe organ failure involve patient 's vital prognostic short term rejection sample donor</criteria>
