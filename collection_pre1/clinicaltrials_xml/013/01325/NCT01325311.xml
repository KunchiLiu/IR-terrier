	<brief_title>Cholecalciferol Genistein Before Surgery Treating Patients With Early Stage Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine difference prostate tissue steady state concentration calcitriol participant treat single dose cholecalciferol ( 200,000 IU ) G-2535 ( provide 600 mg genistein ) receive placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect intervention arm result prostate tissue level calcitriol down-stream related biomarkers relate mechanistic pathway blood tissue . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cholecalciferol orally ( PO ) day 1 genistein PO daily ( QD ) day 1-21 1-28 . Patients undergo prostatectomy . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO day 1 placebo PO QD day 1-21 1-28 . Patients undergo prostatectomy .</detailed_description>
