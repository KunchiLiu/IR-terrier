	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis : Subcutaneous enoxaparin effective subcutaneous heparin prevent development DVT general surgical intensive care unit population . Hospitalized patient increase risk development blood clot leg , know deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) . Surgical patient high risk category general hospital population due number factor include undergoing surgery increase risk immobility . The high risk patient surgical intensive care unit , surgical risk blood clot combine issue sepsis , acquire blood clotting disorder , increase age , factor contribute risk blood clot development . 1 . Patients develop blood clot ( DVTs ) risk chronic leg swelling , pain , case , chronic ulcer development leg . In bad case scenario , blood clot break away migrate lung cause pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , clot lung cause significant breathing difficulty require intubation mechanical ventilation , case , death . According recent research , DVTs account 200,000 patient death year nationwide . 2 . A large amount data support use medication call heparin enoxaparin low dos prevent blood clot form hospital . Both medication consider standard care use patient consider moderate high risk development DVT . 3 . While medication show significantly reduce occurrence DVT appropriate dos , 4. never direct comparison two medication highest-risk population surgical intensive care unit . Our preliminary data suggest patient may lower incidence DVTs use enoxaparin versus heparin . Part reason may requirement three time daily dose heparin compare daily dose enoxaparin . There may also inherent difference efficacy medication .</brief_summary>
