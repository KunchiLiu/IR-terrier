	<brief_summary>The aim research investigate neurolinguistic mechanism underlie thought disorder among schizophrenic patient . In particular , investigate neurolinguistic basis loose association - phenomena population characterize . Several researcher previously suggest loose association among schizophrenic patient relate lack inhibition automatic spread activation mechanism within semantic network ( e.g. , Soriano , Jimenez , Roman , &amp; Bajo , 2008 ) . This research focus relationship I. left-right hemisphere dynamic II . semantic processing , among schizophrenic patient . The research follow Jung-Beeman 's ( 2005 ) model relate semantic association , activation inhibition process function two cerebral hemisphere . Previous research suggest , compare neurotypical population , people schizophrenia show less define - even reverse - hemispheric lateralization pattern semantic processing . This link impairment language function leave hemisphere , language function shift left right hemisphere ( e.g. , Crow , 1997 ) . The investigator assume unique lateralization pattern may cause change balance semantic activation inhibition system among schizophrenic patient . As state , one linguistic model predicts reduce leave hemisphere dominancy influence linguistic function Jung-Beeman 's ( 2005 ) bilateral model language understanding . According model , leave hemisphere specializes precise fine semantic processing , right hemisphere specialize coarse abstract semantic processing . Building upon distinction , assumption schizophrenic patient experience difficulty fine semantic processing cause functional impairment leave hemisphere . It assumption coarse semantic processing - locate right hemisphere - relatively unimpaired . This change balance two process may direct implication associative semantic network among schizophrenic patient . In order test hypothesis , current research make use specific language expression type involve fine coarse semantic processing , evidence crucial right hemisphere involvement : novel metaphor processing . 10-20 adult schizophrenic patient present four different type two word expression : literal ; conventional metaphor ; novel metaphor unrelated . The patient decide quickly accurately possible expression meaningful meaningless brain activity record Magnetoencephalographic ( MEG ) device ( combine high temporal resolution ability localize activity ) . Therefore , main hypothesis schizophrenic patient show bilateral brain activity pattern conduct semantic decision , pattern relate improved reaction time accuracy present novel metaphor present types expression .</brief_summary>
