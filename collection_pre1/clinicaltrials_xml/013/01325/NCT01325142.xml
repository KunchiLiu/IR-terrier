	<brief_title>Genetic Risk Osteonecrosis Jaw ( ONJ ) Patients With Metastatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal research build index risk estimate individual 's risk develop osteonecrosis jaw ( ONJ ) . The bisphosphonates important supportive therapy care patient metastatic bone disease ; able prevent catastrophic event fracture spinal cord compression . However , ONJ associate use bisphosphonates ONJ carry significant morbidity . Presently , insufficient data calculate ONJ risk benefit ratio bisphosphonate use . An ONJ risk assessment tool would improve oncologist 's dental health professional ability anticipate potentially mitigate oral toxicity bisphosphonate therapy . This protocol consist case ( ONJ ) control ( ONJ ) study identify factor associate risk ONJ build index predictive individual 's risk develop ONJ . The index ONJ risk comprise clinical , epidemiologic genetic factor</detailed_description>
