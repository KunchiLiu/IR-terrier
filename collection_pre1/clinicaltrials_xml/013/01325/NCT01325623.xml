	<brief_title>Seizure Detection Automatic Magnet Mode Performance Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prospective , observational , unblinded , multi-site study design collect data patient implant Model 106 VNS Therapy System baseline EMU stay 5 day . After EMU stay , patient continue follow-up safety approximately two year final regulatory approval product .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients clinical diagnosis medically refractory epilepsy dominate partial seizure suitable implantation Model 106 VNS Therapy System . Patients history increase heart rate ( tachycardia ) associate seizure onset base clinical data obtain medical history , admission/hospital chart , prior neurophysiologic evaluation . Patients willing undergo EMU evaluation period least three day activation AMM feature time . Patients average â‰¥ 3 seizure per month base upon diary patient report 3 month prior screen visit . Patients must peakpeak Rwave amplitude great equal 0.40 mV ECG measure propose electrode location neck propose generator location chest via surface ECG electrodes 7 different body position . Patients must least 18 year old . Patients must good general health ambulatory . Patient must willing able complete inform consent . Patients bilateral leave cervical vagotomy . Patients currently use , expect use , shortwave diathermy , microwave diathermy , therapeutic ultrasound diathermy . A VNS Therapy System implant would ( investigator 's judgment ) pose unacceptable surgical medical risk patient . Patients expect require full body magnetic resonance imaging . Patients history VNS Therapy . Patients document history clinically meaningful bradycardia ( heart rate le 50 bpm ) associate seizure . Patients significant psychiatric disorder , significant cognitive impairment , history major depression , suicidality define DSM IVTR investigator 's judgment would pose unacceptable risk patient prevent patient 's successful completion study . Patients history status epilepticus within 3 month study enrollment . Patients prescribed drug specifically cardiac autonomic disorder investigator 's opinion would affect heart rate response unless patient ictal tachycardia taking say drug . These include , limited , beta adrenergic antagonist ( `` beta blocker '' ) . Patients know clinically meaningful cardiovascular arrhythmia well patient clinically meaningful cardiovascular arrhythmia determine 24hour Holter recording obtain screen visit . Patients dependent alcohol narcotic drug define DSM IVTR within past 2 year . Patients history psychogenic pseudo seizure . Women pregnant . Women childbearing age must take pregnancy test . Patients currently enrol another investigational study .</criteria>
