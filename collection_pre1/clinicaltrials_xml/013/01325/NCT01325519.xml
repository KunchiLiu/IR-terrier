	<detailed_description>A.1 . Aim 1 : To recruit 150 subject admit inpatient general medicine ward overall prognosis one year less randomly assign subject : 1. video visually depict CPR preference 2. current standard care without use video ( control ) . Hypothesis 1 : It feasible recruit randomize 150 hospitalized subject overall prognosis one year less . A.2 . Aim 2 : To compare care preference CPR intubation among subject randomize video subject randomize current standard care without video . Hypothesis 2 : Subjects randomize video intervention significantly likely opt CPR intubation compare see video . A.3 . Aim 3 : To compare code-status documentation electronic medical record subject randomize video receive current standard care without video . Hypothesis 3 : Subjects randomize video likely code-status document electronic medical record compare see video . A.4 . Aim 4 : To compare decisional conflict subject randomize video subject randomize current standard care without video . Hypothesis 4 : When compare subject randomize current standard care , subject video intervention group lower decisional conflict ( low decisional conflict score ) ask choose CPR intubation preference . A.5 . Aim 5 : To compare knowledge assessment CPR subject randomize video subject randomize current standard care without video . Hypothesis 5 : When compare subject randomize current standard care , subject video intervention group high knowledge assessment score ask question regard understanding CPR . A.6 . Aim 6 : To compare code-status ( CPR , intubation ) preferences electronic medical record future hospitalization one year post-hospital discharge subject randomize video subject randomize current standard care without video . Hypothesis 6 : Subjects randomize video likely opt CPR intubation future compare see video .</detailed_description>
