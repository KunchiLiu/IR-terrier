	<brief_summary>Rationale : improve early detection AD prodromal pre-dementia stage become major matter concern . There important body literature state early isolate cognitive deficit ( Mild Cognitive Impairment-MCI- ) predict risk develop AD . Several biomarkers available : specific sensitive neuropsychological assessment , morphometric evaluation hippocampal volume white matter change MRI , cerebrospinal fluid plasma dosage Ab fragment tau protein , assessment brain glucose hypometabolism temporo-parietal region PET [ F18 ] FDG . However , PET image use labelled compound specifically bind APs suggest improve diagnostic reliability potentially help shorten delay formal clinical diagnosis AD . F18 AV45 new radiotracer kinetics characteristic allow 10 15 minute acquisition 50 60 minute post injection . Objectives : The primary objective study compare F18 AV45 cortical uptake AD , MCI patient Healthy Controls . Secondary objective compare cortical uptake F18 AV45 MCI subject convert toward dementia versus , two year follow-up period , compare level 18F-AV45 cortical uptake neuropsychological testing , PET FDG hypometabolism , ApoE genotype . Method : Prospective multicentric study . 65 patient expect enter study . Primary outcome measure : Standard Uptake Volume ratio .</brief_summary>
