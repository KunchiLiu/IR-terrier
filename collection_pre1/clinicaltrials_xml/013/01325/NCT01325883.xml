	<detailed_description>STUDY SUMMARY The investigator propose prospective blind observational cohort study patient undergo NAC prior elective upper gastrointestinal cancer resection ( oesophagectomy gastrectomy ) three NHS teach hospital . Exercise capacity ( fitness ) NAC assess use CPET relationship derive variable ( AT , VO2 peak ) clinical outcome describe . Postoperative outcome objective record clinically meaningful include mortality 1 year surgery short term postoperative harm describe PostOperative Morbidity Survey ( POMS ) Quality lifer use EQ5D questionnaire resource use ( e.g . hospital bed utilization ) . The hypothesis test construct predictive model incorporate exercise variable factor know related outcome follow surgery ( e.g . age , gender , open versus laparoscopic surgery ) . For example , Primary Hypothesis , model develop predict risk one year mortality use ( ) baseline exercise capacity ( ii ) baseline exercise capacity relative decrease exercise capacity . The aim compare predictive ability model ascertain prognostic relative decrease exercise capacity , adjust baseline exercise . In addition , Hypothesis 1 investigate comparing AT NAC use pair t-test Hypothesis 2 investigate compare risk 1year mortality patient stay AT band deteriorate use chi square test . Logistic regression use repeat analysis adjust potential confounders .

Reoperation , readmission critical care , readmission hospital QoL Measures : EQ5D , 30days 1year surgery . Date death National Medical Information Service ( update continuously ) . JUSTIFICATION OF MEASURES Justification predictor variable ( AT VO2 peak ) The VO2 ( oxygen consumption ) AT VO2 peak reliably measurable ( use CPET ) widely accept measure exercise capacity ( fitness ) . There simpler , cheap method reliably measure exercise capacity ( fitness ) without use CPET . Both LT VO2 Peak know associated outcome follow major surgery . Justification CPET variables Other CPET derive variable also record order explore reason limitation exercise capacity ( fitness ) order inform type intervention might effective mitigate change . Justification risk measure O-POSSUM reliable valid measure perioperative risk provide standard compare predictive performance CPET derive variable . JUSTIFICATION OF POSTOPERATIVE OUTCOME MEASURES Justification primary secondary outcome variable - Mortality The primary outcome variable cause mortality 1 year date surgery . The investigator choose variable several reason , include : - Is meaningful patient , carers , administrator policy maker . - Is readily verifiable , therefore reliable . - Occurs sufficient frequency allow construction predictive model sample size collect within manageable timeframe . Limitations variable cause death may directly relate chemotherapy surgery may arise due disease progression recurrence . However , all-cause mortality remain important outcome patient . - POMS In order explore relationship NAC , surgery short-term harm investigator propose monitor short-term postoperative harm use PostOperative Morbidity Survey ( POMS ) . POMS validate measure short term postoperative harm16 use outcome research effectiveness research . It current use primary outcome variable MRC NIHR fund study . - Quality Life ( QoL ) Measures use EQ5D The impact NAC surgery patient quality life assess use A validated questionnaire . The investigator assess subjective change patient 's state use questionnaire . The questionnaire self-completed patient , take 15-20 minute total . The questionnaire use EQ5D recommend use generic PROM follow major surgery . - Resource Use In order obtain full picture clinical course resource use study patient , additional outcome variable include : Reoperation , Readmission hospital , length post-operative hospital stay , readmission hospital , total postoperative hospital bed usage , length postoperative critical care stay , readmission critical care , total postoperative critical care bed usage . SAMPLE SIZE The hypothesis list ( Aims Project ) test construct predictive model incorporate exercise variable factor know related outcome follow surgery ( e.g . age , gender , open versus laparascopic surgery ) . For primary hypothesis , model develop predict risk one year mortality use ( ) baseline exercise capacity ( ii ) baseline exercise capacity relative decrease exercise capacity . The aim compare predictive ability model ascertain prognostic relative decrease exercise capacity , adjust baseline exercise . To develop reliable prediction model approximately 252 patient require . This use `` Rule 10 '' assume one year mortality rate 20 % ( conservative estimate ) model contain 5 factor ( e.g . age , gender , centre , location tumour , laparoscopic versus open ) . Given 20 % non-completion NAC 2 CPET test ( base Liverpool data ) , achievable since approximately 525 patient attend centre 25month recruitment period ( base average last three year patient throughput , anticipated recruitment rate 60 % . Sample size Hypothesis 1 : A sample 152 patient would require detect difference 1 [ unit ] VO2 @ LT use pair t-test 5 % significance level 90 % power . This assume standard deviation difference VO2 @ LT value 3.8 [ unit ] . Sample size hypothesis 2B : A sample size 242 require detect difference one year mortality rate 15 % ( 30 % versus 15 % ) two LT change group ( change / deteriorate ) use chi square test 5 % significance level 80 % power . This assume equal number patient group . ANALYSIS PLAN 1 . Relationship exercise capacity change clinical outcome . 2 . Effect chemo exercise capacity CPET variable . Patients complete NAC 2 CPET test eligible enter study data collect . The sample size calculation primary analysis patient complete CPET NAC . Secondary analysis include patient unable complete CPET NAC , compare patient underwent surgery surgery subsequently cancel . Descriptive analysis ( mean proportion ) carry describe patient ' characteristic include baseline change exercise capacity , clinical outcome include 1year mortality , morbidity PROMS . The calculation hypothesis 1 base comparison fitness ( use VO2 @ AT ) NAC . As within-patient comparison investigator use paired t-test . The standard deviation within-patient difference assume 3.8 . This estimate pilot data Background assume correlation 0.5 value . The clinically important difference 1 consider conservative feasible since pilot data difference 2.1 . The calculation hypothesis 2B base dichotomisation patient two group : ) deteriorate NAC b ) n't . To compare mortality rate two group investigator would use chi square test ( although logrank test may appropriate dropout issue ) . It 's assume two group approximately equal ( discuss elsewhere ) mortality rate two group 30 % 15 % respectively . The sample size calculation hypothesis 2/2A base power instead base amount data require develop robust reliable risk model . The idea develop risk prediction model base preNAC factor quantify predictive ability ( e.g . use ROC area ) . McCulloch ( BMJ , 2003 ) something similar . Next investigator add postNAC fitness model establish whether extra data provide extra predictive ability . The usual approach calculate sample size risk model base rule 10 , investigator require 10 time many ( mortality ) event predictor model . Our model 5 factor investigator require 50 event . Assuming mortality rate 20 % suggest investigator require 250 patient total . Note give u specific power detect predefined clinical effect ( would difficult calculation since pre- post-NAC fitness likely correlate ) rather give u enough data fit risk prediction model quantify incremental benefit post-NAC fitness .</detailed_description>
