	<brief_summary>- Multiple myeloma account approximately 1 % cancer 10 % hematologic malignancy . Between 50 70 % symptomatic patient present response induction chemotherapy . The rate complete response ( CR ) achieve standard induction treatment less 5 % case median event-free survival 2 3 year although patient die disease . - High dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplant improve response rate survival patient MM . However eventually patient relapse median EFS 40-50 month post-transplant . - To improve result sustain remission , various maintenance treatment propose case Interpheron alpha2b s.c. ( Intron A ) show benefit meta-analysis . - Intron A s.c. need administration 3 day per week well tolerate - Recently new formulation Interpheron alpha2b available . Conjugated polietilenglicol ( Pegintron ) need one dose weekly test MM . - The purpose study evaluate role Pegintron maintenance autologous transplant MM</brief_summary>
