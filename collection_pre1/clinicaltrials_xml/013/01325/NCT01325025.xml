	<brief_title>Imaging Study White Matter Lesions Children With Metachromatic Leucodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metachromatic Leukodystrophy ( MLD ) rare autosomal recessive disorder cause deficiency Arylsulfatase A enzyme ( ARSA ) , result accumulation galactosyl sulfatide ( cerebroside sulfate ) , major constituent myelin sheath . Accumulation sulfatides lead progressive degeneration white matter central peripheral nervous system ( CNS , PNS ) neuronal degeneration . The late-infantile form MLD , usually diagnose second year life , frequent severe form disease . The prognosis severe , lead vegetative stage death within year diagnosis . There treatment patient affect early-onset form disease . Conventional MRI ( 1.5 Tesla ) show extensive involvement cerebral white matter ( hypo-T1 , hyper- T2 FLAIR signal ) indicative rapidly progress leukodystrophy . Early cortical atrophy reflect associate neuronal involvement . Proton MR spectroscopy demonstrate abnormality choline N-acetyl-aspartate ( demyelination , neuronal loss ) , non-specific serve indicator monitor effect therapeutic intervention . In early-onset form MLD , conventional MRI become abnormal relatively advanced stage disease neuroradiological diagnosis may difficult age 2 - 2 1/2 year age . Moreover , topography extent detectable lesion poorly correlate disease severity . In order improve information provide neuroimaging , study aim investigate prospectively longitudinally ( period 6 month ) white grey matter lesion 10 MLD child age 1 6 year , use high-field MRI ( 3 Teslas ) diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) 3D reconstruction myelin track . The time interval diagnosis inclusion exceed 18 month , thus patient include early stage disease . Each time-point ( T0 6 month ) also include neurological evaluation correlate imaging , cognitive motor function . Children include period 5 year . The total duration study 5.5 year . Controls include 25 age-matched child cryptogenic partial epilepsy high-field MRI detect structural abnormality . Controls MRI cognitive evaluation T0 12 month necessary . This study increase knowledge natural history MLD provide new indicator selection evaluation patient eligible new therapeutic approach .</detailed_description>
