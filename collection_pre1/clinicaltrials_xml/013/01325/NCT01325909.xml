	<brief_summary>Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy ( NACRT ) prior surgery lower gastrointestinal ( colon rectal ) cancer associate improved survival , also adversely affect physical fitness , potentially render patient unfit major surgery increase risk adverse outcome ( death serious complication ) major surgery . The investigator pilot data use upper gastrointestinal cancer patient cohort show neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) reduce objectively measure exercise capacity ( fitness ) . The investigator therefore propose blind , single centre , prospective interventional trial patient undergoing NACRT prior elective colorectal cancer resection NHS teaching hospital . The investigator wish explore various hypothesis : 1 . Is exercise intervention feasible tolerable cohort patient ? 2 . Can fitness improve use structure , responsive exercise training programme ( SRETP ) ? 3 . Can SRETP improve quality life ? 4 . Can SRETP improve physical activity ? 5 . Can SRETP improve surgical outcome ? 6 . Can physiological fitness oncological outcome match identify optimal time physiological recovery follow NACRT prior major surgery . The investigator aim recruit 5 patient feasibility tolerably study 30 patient interventional study 24 month Aintree University Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust . Consenting patient undergo series test design evaluate ability muscle take utilise oxygen , namely cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) VO2 Kinetics test , do pre−CRT 3,6,9 14 week post−CRT ( pre−surgery ) . All patient CPET , well standard restaging scan 9 14 week post NACRT . Outcome , activity quality life data also collect .</brief_summary>
