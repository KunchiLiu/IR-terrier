	<detailed_description>We examine efficacy safety one specific cranial electrical stimulator ( CES ) device fix set subject treatment-resistant major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Thirty subject MDD inadequate response standard antidepressant randomize 3 week treatment CES ( 15/500/15000 Hz , symmetrical rectangular biphasic current 1-4 mAmp , 40 Volts ) sham CES ( device ) 20 minute , 5 day per week . The primary outcome measure improvement 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D-17 ) . Adverse effect ( AEs ) assess use Patient Related Inventory Side Effects ( PRISE ) . We hypothesize subject receive active opposed sham CES would significantly great improvement depression symptom . Due small sample , could hypothesize effect size , would calculate one determine signal strength guide design large , rigorous study . As exploratory aim , also examine whether CES would benefit sleep .</detailed_description>
