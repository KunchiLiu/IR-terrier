	<brief_summary>CONTEXTE : L'Agence de la santé et de service sociaux de Montréal ( ASSS ) invite research team evaluate implementation integrate interdisciplinary primary care network prevention management cardiometabolic risk ( diabetes hypertension ) ( PCR ) . The intervention base Chronic Care Model development integrate service network . PCR implement 6 territory `` Centre de santé et de service sociaux ( CSSS ) '' . A first application funding make Fonds Pfizer-FRSQ-MSSS evaluation complete first 24 month begin implementation . This application PHSI program CIHR complementary ensure evaluation sustainability PCR long term effect ( 40 month begin implementation ) patient primary care physician . In CSSS , PCR plan : 1- interdisciplinary team education center work primary care physician offer referred patient pre-determined sequence clinical intervention 2-year-period ; 2- program support primary care physician ( continue education , documentation clinical guideline , referral system second line care ) ; 3- networking actor `` Réseau local de service ( RLS ) '' insure clinical information transfer require efficient patient management . OBJECTIVES : 1-evaluate PCR effect accord territory , time degree exposure ( specifically benefit register patient support participate primary care physician ) ; 2- identify degree implementation PCR CSSS territory relate contextual factor ; 3- examine relationship effect identify , degree implementation PCR relate contextual factor ; 4- assess impact implement PCR strengthen RLS . METHODS : The propose evaluation do mixed design include two complementary strategy . Using `` quasi-experiment/before-after '' design , first strategy quantitative approach look program effect variation territory . This analysis use data PCR clinical database ( ex . : HbA1c , BP , lifestyle ) patient questionnaire inquire care experience , utilization service , chronic care follow-up , self-management quality life . Around 3000 patient enlist . A primary care physician questionnaire enquire PCR effect practice . Using primarily qualitative case study approach , 6 territory one case , second strategy identify degree implementation PCR explanatory contextual factor . This analysis use data obtain semi-structured interview program manager . The result analysis summarize monograph territory . According type indicator analyze , objective 3 fulfil use linear model longitudinal multilevel model supplement interpretive approach use information monograph discussion group . The impact implement PCR RLS assess interview key informant . RESULTS AND EXPECTED IMPACT : Our study identify effectiveness PCR contextual factor associate successful implementation sustainability PCR . Detailed contextual information allow application result environment similar context chronic condition could benefit integrated service network . KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER : Since decision maker , clinicians researcher take part phase PRC evaluation ( planning , data collection , analysis interpretation ) , diffusion information regard program integral part research process . In addition , result present local , regional , provincial national conference publish report article widely distribute . More specifically , regional symposium organize share evaluation result CSSS region ( n=12 ) local regional partner .</brief_summary>
