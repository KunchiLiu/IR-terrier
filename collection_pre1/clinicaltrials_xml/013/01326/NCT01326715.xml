	<brief_summary>Background : - Contrast agent drug make certain body area abnormalities show well image study , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Mangafodipir MRI contrast agent manganese approve MRI scan liver pancreas . Because contrast agent manganese also show useful study problem nervous system , researcher interest determine mangafodipir may use MRI scan brain eye , two area often experience problem cause disorder affect nervous system , multiple sclerosis . However , information need whether mangafodipir useful purpose , best use MRI scan eye brain . To study mangafodipir closely , researcher interest study use individual multiple sclerosis healthy volunteer .

However , information need whether mangafodipir useful purpose , best use MRI scan eye brain . To study mangafodipir closely , researcher interest study use individual multiple sclerosis healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness mangafodipir image study nerve disorder affect eye brain . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 70 year age either diagnose multiple sclerosis healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test . - Participants 10 outpatient visit screen MRI scan period 2 month . Participants divide Eye Brain group , base area study scan . ( Participants available time may eligible study group . ) - Participants initial MRI scan part screen process . - At first visit , participant baseline MRI scan receiving mangafodipir . - Participants five MRI scan , follow procedure : - Eye image group : MRI scan schedule specific time 2 48 hour receive mangafodipir . Eye MRI participant wear dark contact lens eye patch 30 minute receive mangafodipir , leave 8 hour . The eye remain uncovered . - Brain image group : MRI scan schedule specific time 48 hour 7 day receive mangafodipir . - Participants follow-up MRI scan 1 month receive mangafodipir . This scan do see long mangafodipir may affect MRI image brain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The goal pilot study ass whether : ( 1 ) manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MEMRI ) use mangafodipir trisodium detect multiple sclerosis-related tissue damage retina , optic nerve , brain ; ( 2 ) MRI effect manganese detectable basal ganglion one month follow administration . Study Population Up 15 healthy volunteer 15 participant multiple sclerosis . Design The first phase study involve healthy volunteer focus optimize image protocol . The second phase study participant multiple sclerosis . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure T1-weighted signal intensity , measure : ( 1 ) retina , optic nerve , brain early time point mangafodipir administration ; ( 2 ) basal ganglion , cerebral cortex , whole brain one month follow administration .</detailed_description>
