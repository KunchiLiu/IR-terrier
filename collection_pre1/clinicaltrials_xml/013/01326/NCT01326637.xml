	<brief_summary>Human factor engineering literature make clear appropriate , well-designed well-timed information improve decision make reduce mental workload . Data previous study show appropriate , well-designed well-timed information present many primary care encounter elderly patient . This put primary care physician risk high mental workload poor decision make affect quality safety care deliver patient . Elderly patient particular risk likely comorbidities , medication , cognitive impairment . Dr. Karsh research team test intervention improve performance primary care physician , thus safety primary care elderly . The investigator use randomized experiment , random assignment level patient , test evaluate intervention . The evaluation involve 4 primary care clinic , 4 primary care physician per clinic . The investigator collect data 768 patient visit pre-intervention 1536 patient visit intervention . Intervention patient randomly assign intervention care usual . The Intervention two component : Pre-visit care coordination : - 5-7 day prior study patient 's appointment his/her doctor , doctor 's nurse/MA call study patient collect pertinent clinical information patient use data collection form investigator call Patient Overview Document POD . - The nurse/MA ensure lab result , consultant report , ER report , image study , etc. , need physician available doctor . Team Meeting : On day patient 's appointment prior begin clinic session , nurse/MA meet briefly doctor jointly review POD . Hypotheses : H1 . Primary Care Physician ( PCP ) : The intervention increase situation awareness , reduce PCP mental workload , reduce PCP perceive likelihood error , improve PCP visit satisfaction . PCP efficiency , measure encounter problem density visit , also improve . H2 . Patient : The intervention improve patient ' perception visit variety AHRQ CAHPS measure , physician knowledge patient history . H3 . Patient : The intervention impact number type problem address visit . H4 . Clinic : The intervention affect visit RVUs</brief_summary>
