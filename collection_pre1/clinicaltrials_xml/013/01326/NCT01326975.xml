	<brief_title>Effect Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Delivered Two Different Modalities Breathing Pattern Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many preterm low birth weight infant require continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) breathe support lung immaturity . CPAP deliver infant flow ( TM ) device well study . Prolonged use nasal prong CPAP show cause discomfort , rarely , nasal injury lead long term disfigurement . On hand , High flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) , another modality deliver CPAP , create less pressure nose less disfiguring effect previous research show use HFNC may less effective IF-CPAP provide breathe support infant . We plan study 10 stable preterm infant bear less 32 week ' gestation 1.5 kilogram birth stable least 48hours IF-CPAP . baby randomize start IF-CPAP HFNC 30 minute . After 45 minute adaptation , baby switch modality another 30 minute . By insert specialized feeding tube sensor stomach , measure electrical activity diaphragm ( EAdi ) . By analyse EAdi modality deliver CPAP , want directly assess HFNC affect breathe compare IF-CPAP .</detailed_description>
