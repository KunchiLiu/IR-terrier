	<brief_summary>Using traditional hitherto use uncemented hip prosthesis achieve good clinical result , one drawback risk fracture femoral shaft indbankning prosthesis ( 1-2 % ) . In addition , bone scan demonstrate year surgery drop almost 30 % bone mass femoral shaft . This bone loss increase risk year surgery , increase risk fracture around prosthesis addition impede describe bone replacement prosthesis later . The newly develop prosthesis anchor femoral neck thus involve femoral shaft . This ensure physiological normal weight transfer femur bone . This contribute bone mass long large extent preserve year surgery , good opportunity later make new prosthesis surgery good result . The new prosthesis capable simultaneously reduce incidence thigh pain first year surgery. `</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>10 Year Clinical Evaluation Primoris Hip Component</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>By insertion artificial hip joint young middle age often use so-called uncemented technique prosthesis fix bone without use bone cement . Anchoring happen bone cell grow prosthesis porous surface , thereby create stable anchorage prosthesis , short long term . A hip prosthesis consist 3 main element : 1. socket 2. ball 3. femoral component , hold ball . Femoral component anchor upper end femur include upper 12-15 cm marrow cavity . Achieved good result principle . The method involve risk fracture top end femur bone insertion prosthesis , also bone loss year surgery . Finally 3-10 % chance get thigh pain due different elasticity femur long shank prosthesis . Based foregoing disadvantage femoral component , commonly use , year experiment introduction shorter implant , either anchor femoral neck femoral neck combine top end femur bone ( metaphysis ) . By use prosthesis , proven preserve bone upper femur forward avoid disadvantage term describe femoral pain . There also describe problem use short prosthesis , especially form solution , pain secondary anchor bolt upper femur forward . In Orthopaedic Surgery , Region Nordjylland , one period 1999 2003 33 prosthesis implant clinic Farsø Frederikshavn achieve good result apart pain similar anchoring screw . At follow-up prosthesis , use DEXA scan , investigator show prosthesis , bone-saving , since bone mass femoral neck top end femur bone preserve . From experience aforementioned short prosthesis , investigator join Biomechanical Institute , Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital , Stanmore , London firm Biomet develop modern design . This short prosthesis anchor femoral neck upper end femur ( metaphysis ) . Prosthesis make titanium porous surface ( Bonemaster ® ) . The prosthesis anchor surgery pressure-fit ( press-fit ) week bone grow prosthesis . Prosthesis manufacture 5 size design prosthesis align series CT scan femur carry Stanmore London . Has develop instrument ensure uniform instrumentation minimize risk fracture connection operation . Performed series laboratory test test , prosthesis find completely stable even full load stable risk fracture relate prosthesis insertion minimize . The current study intend examine whether achieve equally good clinical result conventional uncemented femoral component bone mass upper end femur bone preserve . Using specific X-ray analysis ( RSA ) also assess stability prosthesis bone . Both DEXA scan RSA study routine examination Orthopaedic Surgery , Region Nordjylland , Klinik Farsø . The plan surgery 50 young men woman primary secondary osteoarthritis hip joint . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion subject exclusion criterion receive oral write information investigation . Accept patient cooperate investigation confirm patient 's signature approx . 2 week oral write information give . The operation perform usual principle rear access hip joint , removal rod end insertion uncemented socket . After prepare femoral neck top thigh insertion short femur prosthesis make selection use tantalumkugler RSA analysis . When prosthesis insert carry sample-space theorem use 36 mm Co-Cr-ball , currently department 's practice . After surgery patient allow partial load first 6 week . There ongoing clinical radiographic control registration unforeseen event arise use product . If flow 2 year fully comparable clinical outcome , minimal migration measure RSA final preservation bone around implant , use implant extend several clinic home abroad , per recommendation Danish Orthopaedic Association reference program hip replacement surgery . When implement new implant design low risk unforeseen complication form fracture encounter denture-deployment subsequent unexpected prosthetic solution . If burst occurs Intraoperative , convert deployment conventional hip prosthesis without involve major risk patient . Early prosthetic solution also possible deployment conventional complete denture without result deteriorates . The disadvantage possible complication bad case operation ( revision ) . In addition , disadvantage trial participation increase radiation dose due 4 additional X-ray check first 2 year surgery 4 extra bone scan ( DEXA ) . The described investigation clarify whether theoretical advantage hitherto demonstrated clinical biomechanical study ( normal weight transfer , bone spar bone-keeping short long term ) , also obtain apply newly develop prosthetic component . If , able especially young patient osteoarthritis hip joint well chance achieve good clinical outcome long-term sustainability eventual replacement surgery , typically 10-20 year primary surgery . Disadvantages describe study estimate minimal compare benefit large group patient could benefit . The actual cost conducting survey shall bear prosthesis manufacturer Biomet UK Ltd.. Orthopaedic Surgery , North Jutland amount transfer specific research account affiliate research unit Orthopaedic Surgery , Region Nordjylland pay Budget Finance , Region House , Region Nordjylland .</detailed_description>
