	<brief_title>Effect GTx-758 Total Free Testosterone Levels Men With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer one frequently diagnose noncutaneous cancer among men US second common cause cancer death . Patients advanced prostate cancer undergo androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) , either LHRH agonist , LHRH antagonists , DES nonselective estrogen , bilateral orchiectomy . ADT LHRH agonist , LHRH antagonists , bilateral orchiectomy reduce testosterone , also substantially lower estrogen level estrogen derive aromatization testosterone . ADT-induced estrogen deficiency cause significant side effect include hot flush , gynecomastia , bone loss , decrease bone quality strength , osteoporosis life-threatening fracture , adverse lipid change , increase body fat composition , high cardiovascular disease myocardial infarction , depression mood change . GTx-758 nonsteroidal selective ER agonist suppresses LH secretion pituitary feedback inhibition hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis induce castrate level testosterone . However , selective ER agonist , GTx-758 may maintain bone , induce hot flush , avoids adverse lipid change body fat composition change , acute testosterone surge associate form ADT .</detailed_description>
