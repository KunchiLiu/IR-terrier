	<brief_summary>This open label , single arm Phase II study induction chemotherapy follow concurrent chemo-radiotherapy patient locally advanced head neck squamous cell cancer ( HNSCC ) use monoclonal antibody cetuximab . Those patient locally advance HNSCC deem candidate definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy treat initially 6 week PCC ( Paclitaxel , cetuximab Carboplatin ) . This follow week treatment interim evaluation , follow definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy use 70Gy radiation weekly cetuximab cisplatin 7 week . The hypothesis study use cetuximab induction chemotherapy follow cetuximab concurrent chemoradiotherapy use low dose weekly cisplatin improve local control well distant spread .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Induction Chemo Then Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy With Cetuximab Locally Advanced Head Neck Squamous Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy : Chemotherapy would use two phase . In initial phase patient would treat ICT involve 6 cycle PCC . This involve Cetuximab 400mg/m2 Week 1 250mg/m2 weekly , Paclitaxel 80mg/m2 weekly carboplatin AUC 2 weekly 6 week follow concurrent chemoradiotherapy cetuximab . After ICT patient would give weekly Cisplatin 30mg/m2 cetuximab 250mg/m2 concurrent radiation therapy . Radiation Therapy : Typically tumor treat megavoltage ( 6MV ) radiotherapy alone chemotherapy , primary tumor bed adequate margin drain lymphatics treat parallel opposed lateral treatment portal ; low neck node bearing area treat anterior port . The standard total dose target tumor bed electively treat lymphatics 50 Gy/25 fraction , , additional boost dose neoplasm-bearing site ( ) 16 Gy 20 Gy . The total dose receive spinal cord allow exceed 46 Gy . For N1 N3 disease , also shall need total dose ( boost include ) 66 Gy perhaps 70 Gy safely give 6.4 Study Outline : 1 . Patients deem eligible sign inform consent would enrol clinical trial . 2 . Prior start therapy stag PET/CT scan , medical history , physical exam , hematologic biochemical test undertaken . 3 . Since mucositis oropharyngeal dysfunction likely chemo-radiation PEG tube placement consider prior treatment , order allow adequate nutrition case mucositis . 4 . Prior start radiation patient would undergo dental evaluation standard practice . 5 . Patients would undergo 6 week ICT use PCC . Based toxicity dose would modify described section 8 . 6 . For PCC regimen , cetuxmiab would give first follow paclitaxel carboplatin use standard pre-medication . 7 . A CT scan ( PET scan ) head neck perform evaluation Week 7 day week . 8 . Following induction chemotherapy patient would treat radiation therapy 70 Gy concurrent weekly Cisplatin 30mg/m2 cetuximab 250mg/m2 duration radiation therapy . Again dose modification would perform base described section 8 . 9 . Cetuximab would administer first follow cisplatin concurrent radiation . 10 . History Physical examination would perform end treatment document response ass toxicity 10 . Patient residual disease primary site neck completion chemoradiotherapy would offer surgery . 11 . Week 26 ( 3 month ) completion radiation therapy repeat PET scan perform assess response standard care . 12 . After completion treatment patient follow every 3 month interval document relapse manage toxicity treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult patient 18 year old histologically prove locally advanced stage III IV unresectable Squamous cell head neck cancer SCCHN ( include cancer oral cavity , oropharynx , larynx hypopharynx ) evidence distant metastasis 2 . A careful evaluation resection require surgeon criterion unresectability carefully define individual primary site follow : Hypopharynx : The tumor must extend across midline posterior pharyngeal wall fix cervical spine Larynx : There must either direct extension surround muscle skin great 3 cm subglottic extension Oral cavity : The lesion must extensive functional reconstruction possible . Base Tongue : The tumor must extend roof tongue , patient must refuse recommended total glossectomy Tonsil : The tumor must extend pterygoid region manifest clinical trismus demonstrate across midline pharyngeal wall directly soft tissue neck Patients neck lymph node metastases fix carotid artery , mastoid , base skull , cervical spine consider unresectable Medical unsuitability resection sufficient patient eligibility Patient 's refusal surgery except case total glossectomy consider reason unresectibility 3 . Patients must receive prior treatment head neck cancer 4 . ECOG Performance status 01 5 .

Ability give inform consent willingness adhere study protocol 7 . Subjects reproductive potential must agree follow accepted birth control method treatment 12 month completion treatment . Female subject either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study 1 . Patient prior treatment head neck cancer 2 . Prior history radiation head neck area 3 . Known malignancy current cancer 4 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited ongoing active infection , history cardiac disease , e.g . uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , congestive heart failure , myocardial infarction within last six month ventricular arrhythmia require medication , psychiatric illness would impair patient ability comply study requirement 5 . Pregnant lactate woman ( woman become pregnant study withdrawn study ) 6 . Patient document symptoms peripheral neuropathy 7 . History allergic reaction compound similar one use study 8 . Any condition would hamper ability give inform consent ability comply study protocol 9 .
