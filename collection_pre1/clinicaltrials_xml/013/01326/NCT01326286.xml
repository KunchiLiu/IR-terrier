	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Analysis Surgery Radiation ( CEASAR ) Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common solid tumor second leading cause cancer death among American men . While surgery , radiation observation deem appropriate newly diagnose men , tremendous uncertainty remain regard optimal treatment . AHRQ 's 2008 evidence report comparative effectiveness therapy localize prostate cancer conclude `` one therapy consider preferred treatment localized prostate cancer due limitation body evidence well likely tradeoff individual patient must make estimated treatment effectiveness , necessity adverse effect . '' The exist literature limited focus older therapeutic modality failure control individual patient characteristic provider/hospital characteristic may influence outcome ( quality care ) . To fill evidence gap , propose expand network state tumor registry national observational disease registry establish new population-based cohort men newly diagnose localized prostate cancer . We prospectively measure key patient-reported outcome , health-related quality life side-effects therapy diagnosis 6 12 month later . We also collect detailed medical record information , include clinical data , technical detail intervention , complication , short-term cancer recurrence rate , quality-of-care indicator . By use approach , overcome limitation extant literature achieve follow specific aim : 1 . To compare effectiveness contemporary surgical radiation technique localize prostate cancer cohort describe term 6- 12-month patient-reported outcome , side-effects complication treatment . 2 . To identify patient level characteristic may influence comparative effectiveness . 3 . To assess comparative effectiveness various therapy vary quality care receive .</detailed_description>
