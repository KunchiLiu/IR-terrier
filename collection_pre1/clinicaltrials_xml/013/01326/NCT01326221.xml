	<brief_summary>This open-label , non-blinded , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study assess tenofovir emtricitabine ( component Truvada ) concentration within genital tract male female single dose Truvada® . Concentrations active drug measure blood ( woman men ) , cervicovaginal aspirate vaginal tissue ( woman ) , seminal fluid rectal tissue ( men ) . Samples obtain 24 hour ( 1 day ) , 48 hour ( 2 day ) , 5 day , 7 day , 10 day , 14 day post-dose . Each subject undergo 2 biopsy day , least 72 hour apart . Additionally , tissue sample evaluate ex-vivo HIV infectivity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An estimate 80 % HIV infection worldwide acquire sexual transmission.1 Viable method prevent sexual transmission HIV urgently need , especially resource-poor country . As country increase access generic antiretroviral medication , oral administration antiretroviral drug pre-exposure prophylaxis may serve feasible , minimally invasive mechanism prevent sexual transmission HIV globally . Antiretroviral prophylaxis combination tenofovir emtricitabine recently investigate U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention series study rhesus macaque . Researchers develop rectal inoculation model use concentration Simian HIV ( SIV ) representative HIV exposure human . With model , researcher demonstrate standard dos tenofovir disoproxil fumarate delay , partially protect , animal acquisition Simian HIV 14-week time period . In model , high dose tenofovir fully protective infection.2 However , unknown concentration macaque mucosal surface compare human . Notwithstanding , number clinical study currently investigate daily dose tenofovir tenofovir emtricitabine pre-exposure prophylaxis.3 Since daily dose antiretrovirals pre-exposure prophylaxis sustainable long-term , coitally-dependent ( episodic ) dose strategy need . However , extent drug concentrate tissue , duration intracellular phosphate exposure single dos , currently unknown . This information require inform potential success dose strategy . At steady-state concentration , mean blood plasma half-life ( t½ ) tenofovir emtricitabine 15.9 hour 10.7 hour , respectively . 4 However , intracellular t½ tenofovir diphosphate emtricitabine triphosphate &gt; 60 hour 39 hour , respectively.5 The long intracellular t½ active form drug might hold advantage episodic dosing . However , long t½ might also hold disadvantage term development viral resistance mutation . This phenomenon ( development resistance single dose long t½ drug ) , previously see nevirapine give delivery HIV-infected woman prevent mother child transmission HIV.6 However , woman chronically infect , rather newly infect , would case population expose prevention strategy . The propose study aim augment information gather previous study examine intracellular extracellular tenofovir emtricitabine drug concentration various human compartment single dose , describe potential HIV infectivity select tissue sample obtain compartment .</detailed_description>
