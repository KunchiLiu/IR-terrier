	<brief_summary>Medications low blood pressure cholesterol know improve shape function blood vessel . These improvement include reduction thickness wall carotid artery ( main artery run neck supply brain ) reduction stiffness artery generally include main central artery -the aorta . Such medication polypill ( Red Heart Pill ) use UMPIRE Study . In UMPIRE , patient ' report adherence take single , daily polypill compare adherence medication take separate tablet ( usual care ) .The aim PESCA sub-study see whether polypill differs 'usual care ' direct effect blood vessel show ultrasound examination carotid artery assessment central ( aortic ) blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Polypill Effects Sub Clinical Atherosclerosis ( PESCA ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PESCA substudy UMPIRE clinical trial evaluate 'polypill ' treatment strategy subject establish cardiovascular disease high risk . All PESCA subject already recruit UMPIRE randomise take either single 'polypill ' ( comprise low dose aspirin , cholesterol-lowering statin , one two blood pressure lower medicine ) usual treatment consist similar medication one separate tablet . PESCA evaluate whether : 1 ) progression atherosclerosis ( fatty deposit narrow artery impair blood flow vital organ ) ; 2 ) central systolic blood pressure ( pressure body 's main artery , aorta , heart pump blood ) , reduce 'polypill ' recipient compare continue usual treatment . Atherosclerosis central blood pressure strongly associate increase risk heart attack stroke . Atherosclerosis assess ultrasound scan carotid ( neck ) arteries look thickness artery wall ( carotid intima medium thickness ) plaque ( fatty deposit ) . Direct measurement central blood pressure impractical estimate use computerise `` pulsecor '' device . This use inflatable cuff arm provide detailed record pressure wave cuff deflate enables `` pulsecor '' calculate central blood pressure . Results ultrasound blood pressure investigation review investigator know whether subject randomise polypill usual treatment . PESCA assessment conduct 2 visit : baseline ( soon possible recruitment UMPIRE study ) ; end study ( coincide ) . Parallel study undertake three European site ( UK , Eire Netherlands ) participate UMPIRE trial site aim recruit 300 participant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must meet inclusion criterion UMPIRE trial , consent take part PESCA substudy . Inclusion criterion Individuals eligible inclusion follow criterion satisfy : Adults ( ≥ 18 year ) The participant able give inform consent . Established atherothrombotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) high cardiovascular risk , define ; History coronary heart disease ( myocardial infarction , stable unstable angina pectoris , coronary revascularisation procedure ) , History ischaemic cerebrovascular disease ( ischaemic stroke transient ischaemic attack ) , History peripheral vascular disease ( peripheral revascularisation procedure amputation due vascular disease ) , For individual without establish cardiovascular disease , calculate 5 year CVD risk 15 % great ( calculate use 1991 Anderson Framingham risk equation adjustment define New Zealand Guidelines Group recommendation ) The trial Investigator considers polypill component indicated dos Red Heart Pill The trial Investigator unsure whether polypillbased strategy usual care well . Exclusion criterion Individuals NOT eligible one follow criterion satisfy : Contraindication component polypill ( e.g . know intolerance aspirin , statin , ACE inhibitor ; pregnancy likely become pregnant breastfeeding woman treatment period ) . The treat doctor considers change participant 's cardiovascular medication would put participant risk ( e.g . symptomatic heart failure , high dose βblocker require manage angina rate control atrial fibrillation , accelerate hypertension , severe renal insufficiency , history severe resistant hypertension ) . Other potential reason exclusion include : Known situation medication regimen might alter significant length time , e.g . current acute cardiovascular event , plan coronary bypass graft operation . Unlikely complete trial ( e.g . lifethreatening condition cardiovascular disease ) adhere trial procedure attend study visit ( e.g . major psychiatric condition , dementia ) .</criteria>
