	<brief_title>Torisel Addition Standard Chemotherapy With Radiation Advanced Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 30,000 new case local-regionally advanced head neck carcinoma ( HNC ) head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) diagnose year surgery either insufficient , non-curative feasible . For patient , radiation therapy mainstay treatment often use concurrent chemotherapy and/or concurrent cetuximab therapy . Radiation therapy also commonly employ post-operative setting patient high risk feature predispose recurrent disease . Although progress make , prominent pattern failure among aggressively treat patient remain loco-regional failure . The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , member ErbB family receptor tyrosine kinase , abnormally activate nearly epithelial cancer , include HNC . Nearly HNC express high level EGFR associate poor outcome . Radiation therapy lead increase expression EGFR cancer cell , blockade EGFR signal show sensitize cell ionize radiation . The use monoclonal antibody direct EGFR rich pre-clinical record . However , publication Bonner trial combine radiotherapy plus anti-EGFR therapy show successful clinic treat HNSCC . This study show addition single agent cetuximab 250 mg/m2 give weekly concurrent radiation therapy improve median overall survival 29 49 month . Furthermore , progression-free survival improve 12 17.1 month . In addition , patient able tolerate regimen difference rate mucositis . Other toxicity also similar radiotherapy alone , exception small risk infusion reaction , common - non-dose limit - occurrence acneiform rash . Temsirolimus specific inhibitor mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , enzyme regulates cell growth proliferation . Temsirolimus prevent progression G1 phase S phase cell cycle inhibition mTOR , novel mechanism action anticancer drug . This also important concurrent treatment radiation , since S-phase represent radiation resistant phase cell cycle . Temsirolimus structural analog sirolimus ( rapamycin ) formulate IV oral administration treatment various malignancy . Sirolimus show potent immunosuppressive well antifungal antitumor property . Its mechanism action result part bind intracellular cytoplasmic protein , FK506 ( tacrolimus ) binding protein ( FKBP ) -12 . The complex sirolimus bound FKBP-12 block activity mTOR . Cetuximab important agent treatment HNSCC ; however success may limit downstream signal molecule may up-regulate cause malignant phenotype persist . MET proto-oncogene amplification hypothesize lead EGFR-independent activation PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway activation HER3-dependent signaling . We hypothesize attack HNC two key point cellular proliferation survival system maximize HNC cell kill irradicate subpopulation cell may able bypass EGFR inhibition independent activation PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway . The concomitant use cetuximab temsirolimus permit active inhibition EGF , VEGF pathway related angiogenesis , synergistic response see experimental model . Although patient pre-existing renal functional condition - prevent administration cisplatin - receive cetuximab concurrently radiation standard care , clear phenomenon development EGFR inhibitor resistance . Therefore , ability target one escape pathways EGFR inhibitor resistance via blockade PI3K pathway , possibly synergistic manner , provide important novel method achieve high rate complete durable response treatment patient unable tolerate traditional chemotherapeutic agent . In patient pre-existing renal functional condition , cisplatin consider standard care . However , give relatively poor rate disease free survival platinum radiation combination , Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) 0522 phase III trial combination accelerate radiation therapy cisplatin cetuximab complete accrual March 2009 . The result trial still pending , although fact close accrual indicates tolerable regimen . In patient receive cisplatin , receive temsirolimus together cisplatin , cetuximab radiation phase I study . In patient judged medical oncologist unable receive cisplatin , receive temsirolimus together cetuximab radiation separate arm phase I study . We show maximum tolerated dos temsirolimus primary objective , secondary objective examine progression-free survival 12 month two arm .</detailed_description>
