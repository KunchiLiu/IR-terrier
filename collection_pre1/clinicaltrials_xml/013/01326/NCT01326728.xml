	<brief_summary>Background : Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allotransplant ; donor blood stem cell ) use vary degree success immune therapy blood-system cancer ( leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , lymphoma , multiple myeloma , etc. ) . Some people cancer remain active ( come back continue spread ) allotransplant , people cancer disappear hopefully cure . NIH researcher study reason different treatment outcome , try develop good cancer treatment people active cancer allotransplant . Researchers collect data people allotransplants cancer blood , whether cancer remission , donor . Those active cancer may eligible participate one several NIH study test treatment active cancer allotransplant . Objectives : - To develop systematic , comprehensive evaluation individual relapse malignant blood cancer allotransplant ( , available , donor ) identify potential treatment study option - To compare immune system allotransplant people whose cancer grow people whose cancer remain remission . - To compare immune system cancer relapse/progression treatment people whose cancer respond treatment whose cancer continue grow . Eligibility : - Individuals whose blood system cancer grow come back receiving allotransplant treatment . - Individuals whose blood system cancer respond remission 100 day receive allotransplant treatment . - Related stem-cell donor eligible allotransplant recipient . Design : - Participants evaluate full physical examination , detailed medical history ( recipient , include history allotransplant treatment process , side-effects , etc . ) , blood test . Recipients also image study , possible tissue biopsy , quality life questionnaires/assessments , test evaluate current state cancer , whether active remission . In case , may possible substitute result recent test and/or biopsy . - Healthy related donor apheresis provide white blood cell study and/or use potential treatment option . If stem cell would medically helpful recipient , donor might ask take injection filgrastim apheresis procedure stimulate production stem cell collection . - As feasible , recipient ask return NIH detail follow-up visit conjunction 6 , 12 , 24 month post-allotransplant evaluation , may monitor visit . - Recipients whose cancer active find eligible treatment protocol NIH continue monitor study participate treatment protocol . Return visits follow-up test study coordinate required treatment protocol . - Participants may return future evaluate new treatment study option ( recipient ) additional cell donation therapy ( donor ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relapsed Malignant Blood Cancer After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Cancer relapse significant clinical problem follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allotransplant ) , affect half patient . Effective treatment option extremely limited , cancer , rarely curative . - Several CC protocol evaluate treatment post-allotransplant relapse . Relapse often progress quickly ; patient require rapid assessment protocol option order expedite initiation treatment . - Basic information need improve management relapse allotransplant clinical information regard risk relapse cancer behavior allotransplant , information biology relapse allotransplant order identify risk factor , target prevention strategy , detect early relapse develop effective treatment . Objectives : Primary Objective : To provide mechanism systematic , comprehensive evaluation individual relapse hematologic malignancy allotransplant , available , donor , streamline identification protocol option , enrollment initiation therapy . Eligibility : 1 . Individuals receive allotransplant treatment hematologic malignancy ( `` Recipient-Subjects '' ) . Analyses ( secondary aim ) consider two comparison cohort : 1 . Relapse Cohort : Cancer progression , relapse persistently stable ( unremitting ) disease 2 . Remission ( Control ) Cohort : Cancer response remission at/after Day 100 2 . Individuals enrol Clinical Center protocols undergo allotransplant therapy hematologic malignancy evaluate Clinical Center plan allotransplantation . ( Recipient-Subjects ) 3 . Related donor eligible allotransplant recipient ( `` Donor-Subjects '' ) Design : 1 . Recipient-Subjects clinical research evaluation baseline three six month post-allotransplant , six-month interval three year post-allotransplant , yearly . Evaluation relapse treatment response new protocol option permit . 2 . Donor-Subjects enrol time clinical evaluation cell collection Recipient-Subject therapy . Return evaluation additional clinical product collection permit . 3 . Accrual Ceiling : 500 consented subject ( 350 Recipient-Subjects 150 Donor-Subjects ) 5 year , average 70 Recipient-Subjects 30 Donor-Subjects enrol per year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : RECIPIENT SUBJECTS : 1 . Individuals candidate allotransplant therapy hematologic malignancy evaluate Clinical Center plan allotransplantation . 2 . Individuals receive allotransplant treatment hematologic malignancy : 1 . Hematologic recovery allotransplant : e.g. , neutrophil recovery 500 cells/mcL . Secondary cytopenia cytopenia due disease progression permit . Note : requirement apply subject enrol pretransplant , i.e , receive transplantrelated medical care CC . 2 . An ongoing relationship primary oncologist continue provide continuity care study participation . 3 . Following record review information exchange patient primary oncologist NCI PI/Designee , PI/Designee determine individual reasonably could expect safely tolerate travel CC undergo evaluation define protocol , event patient ineligible uninterested participate open treatment protocol . 3 . 1899 year . 4 . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . DONOR SUBJECTS : 1 . Individuals are/will donor allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant receive RecipientSubjects enrol protocol . 2 . Age 1899 year . 3 . Ability subject understand willingness sign write informed consent document . 4 . Individuals evidence infection transfusiontransmittable agent ( Hepatitis B C Viruses ( HBV , HCV ) ; Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ( Omega ) ) , Human TLymphotrophic Virus ( HTLV I/II ) , West Nile Virus ( WNV ) Trypanosoma cruzi ) exclude study participation . However , DonorSubjects evidence HIV infection able donate cell research . Donors history HBV HCV infection able donate research , may eligible donate therapeutic administration . However , determination permissibility clinical donation require hepatology consultation consent intend recipient discussion risk/benefit donor cell product possibility/consequences transmission . The PI/Designee make final determination permissibility donation recipient cell therapy . 6 . Unrelated donor selection accordance National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) standard . When potentially eligible recipient unrelated donor product NMDP Center identify , recipient complete NMDP search transfer request allow NIH NMDP staff contact NMDP Coordinating Center , , turn , contact donor prior Donor Center . The NMDP Policy Subsequent Donation Requests follow appropriate form ( Subsequent Donation Request Form Therapeutic T Cell Collection Prescription Form ) submit require . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : RECIPIENT SUBJECTS : 1 . Individuals rapid disease progression aggressive cancer histology , opinion PI/Designee , require urgent therapy within 30 day order preserve organ function quality life . This restriction apply approve therapy reasonable chance disease response , patient access effective therapy patient appear eligible accrue CC treatment protocol patient enrol NIH/CC clinical protocol , e.g. , allotransplant protocol . 2 . Pregnancy lactate . Additionally , RecipientSubjects childbearing potential receive cancer treatment protocol must willing use effective method contraception . DONOR SUBJECTS : 1 . Adult donor eligible clinical donation exclude study participation , able donate cell research .</criteria>
