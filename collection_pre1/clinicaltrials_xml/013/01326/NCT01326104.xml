	<brief_summary>Immunotherapy specific approach treat cancer show promise adult patient treatment melanoma , malignant brain tumor , cancer . The study investigator use experience gain study try improve outcome child affect recurrent brain tumor . This study two phase . During Phase I , approximately 9 patient treat increase dos tumor-specific immune cell determine safety treatment . Phase I patient also receive dendritic cell vaccine help boost function immune cell maintain growth . During Phase II , approximately 35 patient treat tumor-specific immune cell dendritic cell vaccine see impact tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malignant brain tumor represent frequent cause cancer death child . Despite aggressive highly toxic multi-modality therapy include surgery , craniospinal radiation , high-dose chemotherapy couple peripheral blood stem cell transplantation , almost half child diagnose common malignant brain tumor , medulloblastoma ( MB ) primitive neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) , still die recurrent disease . Furthermore , survivor often leave severe lifelong treatment-associated cognitive motor deficit . The development effective tumor-specific therapy add toxicity exist treatment paramount improve clinical outcome child affect MB/PNETs . Immunotherapy target tumor-specific antigen express within brain tumor modality potentially capable meeting clear urgent need . Despite considerable advancement promise clinical result observe immunotherapy trial direct adult malignant brain tumor , effort immunologic treatment pediatric brain tumor limit relatively notable study . This due , least part , often limited viable tumor tissue available tumor cell-based vaccine preparation , lack identification consistently express tumor-specific antigen within cancer . The use total tumor RNA ( TTRNA ) -loaded dendritic cell ( DCs ) pioneer Duke University , novel platform induce potent immunologic response variety uncharacterized patient-specific antigen present within malignant tumor cell . Duke demonstrate sufficient RNA clinical vaccine preparation amplify high fidelity use exist molecular technology 500 isolated pediatric adult brain tumor cell , thus allow vaccine preparation surgical biopsy even microdissected archival tumor specimen . In study , investigator treat recurrent MB/PNETs hematopoietic recovery chemotherapy . Immunotherapy administer recovery chemotherapy may tremendous advantage , adoptive cellular therapy follow lymphodepletive conditioning regimen emerge effective treatment strategy advance refractory melanoma . Our hypothesis DC + ex vivo expand Autologous Lymphocyte Transfer ( xALT ) therapy target recurrent MB/PNETs recovery myeloablative chemotherapy safe prolong survival child young adult recurrent MB/PNETs .</detailed_description>
