	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab see well work treat patient lymphoma , multiple myeloma , solid tumor come back responded treatment . Veliparib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Others interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Giving veliparib together bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) ABT-888 ( veliparib ) combination bendamustine ( bendamustine hydrochloride ) patient solid tumor , lymphoma , multiple myeloma . ( Phase Ib ) II . To establish safety ABT-888 combination bendamustine rituximab expansion cohort patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . ( Phase Ib ) III . To assess toxicity profile regimen patient . ( Phase Ib ) IV . To determine complete response ( CR ) rate patient indolent NHL mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) treat ABT-888 + bendamustine + rituximab . ( Phase IIa ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate survival parameter patient treat ABT-888 + bendamustine +/- rituximab . ( Phase Ib ) II . To assess pharmacokinetic parameter ABT-888 regimen . ( Phase Ib ) III . To assess progression-free survival , overall survival , duration remission patient indolent NHL MCL treat ABT-888 + bendamustine + rituximab . ( Phase IIa ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study veliparib follow phase II study . Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 bendamustine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Once maximum-tolerated dose determine , cohort patient receive veliparib bendamustine hydrochloride rituximab IV day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
