	<brief_summary>Portal vein thrombosis ( PVT ) refer obstruction trunk portal vein . It extend downstream portal branch , upstream splenic and/or mesenteric vein . The prevalence PVT 10-25 % incidence 16 % cirrhotic patient . Recent study demonstrate presence PVT independent predictor failure control active variceal bleed prevent variceal rebleeding , also significantly associate increased mortality patient liver cirrhosis . However , recent American Association Study Liver Disease ( AASLD ) practice guideline Baveno V consensus management PVT cirrhotic patient , treatment strategy cirrhotic patient PVT clearly recommend due absence randomize controlled trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt ( TIPS ) Prevention Variceal Rebleeding Cirrhotic Patients With Portal Vein Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anticoagulation Anticoagulation appear effective first-line therapy PVT non-cirrhotic patient . However , anticoagulation complex set cirrhosis . The risk benefit ratio anticoagulation never fully confirm cirrhosis history variceal bleed high-risk varix . Furthermore , application anticoagulation combine non-selective beta-blockers endoscopic variceal ligation completely advocate cirrhotic patient PVT due limit report increase risk bleeding . Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ( TIPS ) TIPS regard second-line therapy secondary prophylaxis variceal bleed cirrhotic patient . However , indication might change set PVT , give early decision TIPS PVT might achieve high recanalization rate . Certainly , early decision TIPS seem bring risk hepatic encephalopathy , liver failure , procedural complication , although high recanalization rate thrombose portal vein prevention variceal bleed achieve . Indeed , risk benefit ratio TIPS cirrhotic patient PVT prevention recurrent variceal bleed never evaluate . The aim study compare efficacy safety TIPS conventional therapy ( endoscopic treatment , propranolol anticoagulation ) decompensated cirrhosis patient PVT history variceal bleeding .</detailed_description>
