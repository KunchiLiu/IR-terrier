	<brief_summary>The goal study compare different way treat pain surgery . This research study involve subject supracondylar elbow fracture need surgery . This type fracture occur humerus ( upper arm bone ) break elbow . Like surgery , expect feel pain hour day operation . Currently , despite common occurrence surgery , standard way treat prevent pain afterwards . At hospital , oral ( take mouth ) pain medicine commonly use treat pain surgery . In study , pain treat one follow way : 1. oral pain medication 2. oral pain medicine intraarticular shot ( shot elbow joint ) bupivacaine ( `` numb '' drug ) 3. oral pain medicine intraarticular shot ropivacaine ( another `` numbing '' drug ) . The shot give surgery . Your participation help u find three pain control method work best . The correct dosage drug safely prescribe doctor individual basis drug use careful watch attend physician . All drug use study approve FDA use adult specifically approve use child . However , nearly 7 every 10 drug approve adult specifically approve FDA use child . All drug use study use way consider safe reasonable Children 's Hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Post-Operative Pain Management Pediatric Supracondylar Elbow Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : In recent year , despite lack consistent evidence , use intraarticular ( joint ) injection ambulatory , orthopaedic surgery become popular strategy reduce post-operative pain . In randomized , single center , prospective study investigator evaluate analgesic effectiveness intraarticular injection local anesthesia close reduction percutaneous pinning ( CRPP ) supracondylar type elbow fracture ( SCEFx ) child . In order determine efficacy intraarticular injection , perceive post-operative pain compare among three study group receive either 0.25 % intraarticular injection bupivacaine ( Group 1 ) , 0.20 % intraarticular injection ropivacaine ( Group 2 ) intraarticular injection ( Control ) . All group receive post-operative oral pain medication oxycodone ( 0.1 0.15 mg/kg ) acetaminophen . Primary Aim ( ) : Compare primary secondary pain outcome variable three study group . - The primary pain outcome variable define follow : - Self-reported pain within 30-60 min . arrival recovery room - Self-reported pain two hour post-operative - The secondary pain outcome variable define follow : - Parent perception post-operative pain ( score modify version Foster Varni 's Total Quality Pain Management Survey ( TQPM ) give first two hour surgery ) - Time first administration oral pain medication - Total dose frequency oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative - Dose ( per kg ) local anesthetic receive intra-operatively - Total dosage intra-operative analgesic ( morphine equivalent ) - Pre-operative The Faces Pain Scale-Revised ( FSP-R ) score Hypotheses Primary Aims : - There significant difference pain outcome variable amongst Groups 1 2 . - There statistically significant difference pain outcome variable compare ; Group 1 Control well Group 2 Control . Secondary Aim I : Evaluate overall effect gender , ethnicity , age , American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) classification , fracture type anesthesia time pain outcome variable study population : Hypotheses Secondary Aim I : The investigator expect age , gender , ASA classification , fracture type anesthesia time significant effect primary secondary pain outcome variable study population whole . - Participants age 4-7 associate pain participant age 8-12 ( increase selfreported pain score , increase parent TQPM score , decrease time first administration oral pain medication , increase total dosage oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative , increased frequency oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative ) . - Females associate pain male ( increase self-reported pain score , increase parent TQPM score , decrease time first administration oral pain medication , increase total dosage oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative , increased frequency oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative ) . - An ASA classification III associate pain classification I II ( increase self-reported pain score , increase parent TQPM score , decrease time first administration oral pain medication , increase total dosage oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative , increased frequency oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative ) , - A type III fracture type associate pain type I II ( increase selfreported pain score , increase parent TQPM score , decrease time first administration oral pain medication , increase total dosage oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative , increased frequency oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative ) . - An increase anesthesia time associate pain . ( increased self-reported pain score , increase parent TQPM score , decrease time first administration oral pain medication , increase total dosage oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative , increased frequency oral pain medication take first 72 hour post-operative ) . Secondary Aim II : Evaluate overall effect gender , ethnicity , age , ASA classification ( I , II III ) , fracture type anesthesia time pain outcome variable study group ( Compare 1 , 2 Control study population whole ) . Hypotheses Secondary Aim II : The investigator anticipate group difference effect age , gender , ASA classification , fracture type anesthesia time primary secondary pain outcome variable . Secondary Aim III : Compare Group 1 Group 2 potential dose dependent relationship report pain outcome variable total dose intraarticular injection . Hypotheses Secondary Aim III : In group , investigator anticipate non-significant association increase dose local anesthetic decrease post-operative FSP-R score . There difference significance dose dependent relationship Group I Group 2 .</detailed_description>

Patients able understand report pain Faces Pain Scale Revised Medical contraindication analgesic therapy . Known allergy sensitivity analgesic agent . Clinical evidence skin inflammation preclude 'clean ' area site injection . Patients lack cognitive understanding report pain FSPR ( unable complete seriation task ) . Patients necessitate open reduction due inability obtain acceptable closed reduction . Comorbid diagnosis traumatic injury cause local global pain . Patients present ER neurovascular injury compartment syndrome due fracture . For patient either two intervention arm , three attempt , intraarticular injection successful , patient drop study . Patients admit complication directly relate surgery drop analysis . Any event immediately report COMIRB five business day . However , patient admit due late afternoon/evening surgery patient admit standard observational purpose unrelated surgical complication , drop study . Known drug allergy oxycodone acetaminophen .
