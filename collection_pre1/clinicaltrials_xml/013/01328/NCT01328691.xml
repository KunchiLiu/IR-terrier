	<brief_summary>Renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) propensity invade venous system , extension renal vein inferior vena cava ( IVC ) 23 % 7 % , respectively . Despite advance radiation , chemotherapy , immunotherapy reference standard RCC tumor thrombus remain surgical resection . However , 5-year survival rate patient RCC venous tumor thrombus treat radical nephrectomy tumor thrombectomy 35 % - 45 % , despite development surgical technique perioperative care . Furthermore , even 5-year survival rate patient without evidence nodal distant metastasis presentation 45 % - 65 % . The outcome prediction RCC remain controversial , although many parameter test prognostic significance , achieve widespread acceptance clinical practice . Currently , pathologic stage ( T stage ) , lymph node status ( N stage ) histologic grade represent main prognostic variable patient RCC venous tumor thrombus . Accordingly , American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) TNM classification regularly revise , recently , new 2009 AJCC TNM stage classification system propose . RCC prevalent develop country , Europe North America . It relatively less common Asia ; however , incidence region appear risen past decade . Recently , series suggest racial ethnic difference survival persist control age stage cancer . In case renal cell carcinoma , demonstrate malignancy diagnose various ethnic group different clinical characteristic : presenting symptom , course disease , outcome standard treatment vary significantly patient Caucasian , Hispanic , African-American , Asian background . A recent study report race well establish factor impact survival patient RCC Asian Pacific Islander ethnicity predictive improve overall cancer specific survival . Up date , sparse data surgical outcome prognostic factor survival radical nephrectomy thrombectomy Asian population RCC venous tumor thrombus , study perform Western country . The aim present study address surgical outcome radical nephrectomy thrombectomy evaluate prognostic factor influence survival Korean patient RCC tumor thrombus extension renal vein IVC , label T3a T3b-c newly revise 2009 AJCC TNM stag system , respectively .</brief_summary>
