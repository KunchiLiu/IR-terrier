	<brief_summary>Rationale : The mortality end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient dialysis remain high . This may least partly due insufficient removal ( especially protein-bound ) uremic toxin associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality . It unknown whether combination long-hour haemodialysis ( HD ) convection increase removal toxin . Long-hour HD long-hour haemodiafiltration ( HDF ) may also improve haemodynamic stability important factor treatment quality . The investigator aim study removal uremic toxin long-hour HD HDF compare haemodynamics 4-hour 8-hour HD HDF . Objectives : The primary aim study removal ( especially protein-bound ) uremic toxin 4-hour 8-hour HD HDF . A secondary aim compare haemodynamic response 4-hour 8-hour HD HDF .</brief_summary>
