	<brief_summary>Background &amp; Objective : Type 2 diabetes complex disease characterize multiple comorbidities . Depression one common comorbidities individual diabetes prevalence rate reach 30 % . Depression complicate diabetes treatment , portend bad outcome increase health care cost . One novel approach manage diabetes co-morbid depression collaborative primary care model involve multidisciplinary health care team guide patient-centered care . This model test US show significant reduction depressive symptom , improve diabetes care patient-reported outcome , save money . Our aim evaluate implementation collaborative care model type 2 diabetes comorbid depression within non-metro Primary Care Network ( PCN ) set Canada . Intervention : The intervention involve three phase : ( 1 ) improve depressive symptom , ( 2 ) improve blood sugar , blood pressure cholesterol , ( 3 ) improve lifestyle behaviour . The intervention administer CM collaboration family physician , psychiatrist , internist . Hypotheses : The TeamCare-PCN intervention reduce depressive symptom , achieve target cardio-metabolic measure improve lifestyle behaviour . Furthermore , investigator anticipate intervention acceptable implement cost-effective manner PCN environment . Methods : The investigator employ mixed-methods approach evaluation , use control `` on-off '' trial design . Our primary analysis base multivariable scaled marginal model combine outcome depressive symptom medical care . Secondary analysis assess change lifestyle behaviour patient-reported outcome . Significance : Our work serve platform upon emerge model primary care incorporate effective cost-effective depression intervention management individual type 2 diabetes , framework implement evaluate similar intervention individual chronic condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>I . Brief Overview The over-arching objective study implement evaluate evidence-based intervention call TeamCare-PCN individual type-2 diabetes comorbid depression within primary care network ( PCNs ) . TeamCare-PCN base proven efficacious cost-saving collaborative primary care model ( Katon et al. , 2010 ) involve Care Manager ( CM ) provide active patient management supervision family physician consulting psychiatrist internist . The goal intervention achieve remission depression , reach target cardio-metabolic measure , improve lifestyle behaviour . II . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize TeamCare-PCN intervention reduce depressive symptom , achieve target cardio-metabolic measure improve lifestyle behaviour . III . Setting , Participants , Sample Size TeamCare-PCN conduct collaboration 4 PCNs non-metro Alberta : St. Albert Sturgeon PCN , Leduc/Beaumont/ Devon PCN , Camrose PCN , Heartland PCN . We estimate minimum total sample size 120 , 60 arm , would provide power 0.80 detest mean difference 5 point PHQ-9 , assume repeat measure correlation 0.6 , 2-tailed alpha 0.05 . This sample size also provide 80 % power ( two side alpha = 0.05 ) detect between-group absolute difference proportion 15 % ( e.g. , 45 % usual care patient achieve depression remission vs 60 % intervention patient ) ( Katon et al. , 2010 ) . Anticipating 40 % attrition rate , plan recruit 168 patient total across 4 PCN site . IV . Participant Recruitment Allocation Recruiting participant TeamCare-PCN involve four step . ) A screen survey accompany endorsement letter PCN general information letter . Included screen PHQ-9 . ii ) After potential participant complete screen survey mail back PCN , staff PCN identify respondent eligible participate TeamCare-PCN response screen survey score PHQ-9 . iii ) PCN staff contact eligible participant brief phone interview confirm eligibility criterion schedule initial assessment visit CM PCN . iv ) CM meet participant , initial assessment , CM explain intervention , provide intervention-specific information letter obtain signed write informed consent patient participate study . Participants allocate study group use 'on-off ' allocation method . Eligible consent respondent book initial assessment CM month 1 allocate intervention arm ( On-group ) . Those book initial assessment month 2 allocate usual care arm ( Off-group ) . This allocation process continue target sample size recruit . V. Team Care Depression Intervention Diabetes A . Patient Management : Patients enter intervention initial one-hour appointment CM . This first visit include bio-psychosocial semi-structured assessment ( review medical history , previous treatment depression diabetes ) , patient education , potential treatment option ( anti-depressant medication and/or psychotherapy ) develop overall individualize care plan . The intervention consist 3 phase ; first focus depression management , second cardio-metabolic diabetes management , third general lifestyle modification . The CM also weekly meeting consult specialist review new case patient progress , make treatment recommendation primary care physician . B . Training Care Managers Specialists : The CMs consulting specialist already receive 2-day training course TeamCare-PCN intervention , include pharmacotherapy depression introduction psychotherapeutic technique ( i.e . problem solving , behavioural activation , motivational interviewing ) , well team interaction , role responsibility . An overview cardio-metabolic diabetes management , include , glucose control , insulin management , blood pressure management treatment high lipid level base developed algorithm , also provide training session . TeamCare-PCN training manual develop used training session , retain CM . VI . Usual Care All participants TeamCare-PCN actively screen depression allot usual care identify family physician . For depression management , patient receive care family physician , without additional active support Care Manager . VII . Data Analysis As initial focus intervention management depressive symptom , consider PHQ-9 main primary outcome , assess change PHQ-9 score 12-months group , adjust baseline PHQ-9 score , use mixed effect multivariate model . For second primary outcome improvement global disease control , employ multivariate model jointly test change multiple clinical outcome , namely A1c , LDL cholesterol systolic blood pressure . Using analytic approach recently publish RCT intervention , apply scale marginal model ( Katon et al. , 2010 ) simultaneously compare change continuous outcome 12 month , adjust baseline status variable . In either primary outcome analysis , model estimate iteratively potential correlation among outcome within individual handle use generalized-estimating equation ( GEE ) model outcome . For analysis investigator employ intention-to-treat framework primary analysis , use last-observation-carried-forward method imputation subject complete follow-up data primary secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
