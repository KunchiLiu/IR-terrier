	<detailed_description>Introduction : The air-QⓇ Intubating Laryngeal Airway ( ILA ) ( Mercury Medical , Clearwater , Fl . ) new supraglottic airway . It approve use primary airway aid intubation situation anticipate unanticipated difficult airway . A unique feature device compare airways market size inner diameter ( ID ) length airway tube . Direct placement tracheal tube &gt; 7.5 mm ID airway tube possible . The ProSealTM LMA ( LMA North America , La Jolla , CA ) consider gold standard supraglottic device respect airway seal pressure . On average , report approximately 28 cmH2O . This significantly high first generation LMA , LMA-ClassicTM , maximum seal pressure 20 cmH2O , average 16-18 cmH2O actual practice . Pilot data 50 insertion air-QⓇ institution place device intermediate two aforementioned LMAs regard seal pressure , mean seal pressure 23 ( 12-30 ) cmH2O . Specific Aims : 1 . To test whether air-QⓇ creates airway seal pressure similar LMA-ProSealTM . 2 . To test whether position air-QⓇ relation vocal cord , assess fiberoptic endoscopy , similar LMA-ProSealTM . 3 . To test whether airway morbidity similar air-QⓇ LMA-ProSealTM Study design : Prospective , single-center , randomize , control trial Methods : The patient meet pre-operative area attend anesthesiologist , interview examine patient . A full explanation general anesthetic , include risk benefit , give informed consent obtain . An intravenous catheter place patient premedicated needed discretion attend anesthesiologist . In operating room , patient undergo standard monitoring per establish American Society Anesthesiology ( ASA ) guideline . After period breathe 100 % oxygen facemask , anesthesia induce intravenously typically fentanyl 0.5-1.5 mcg.kg -1 ( fast act narcotic ) propofol ( potent sedative/amnestic agent ) 2-3 mg.kg -1 . After eyelash reflex lose ( i.e . patient asleep breathing ) , patient typically ventilate facemask demonstrate patency airway . The LMA place use standard technique . The cuff LMA inflate adequacy placement assess presence end-tidal carbon dioxide adequate chest rise . The airway seal pressure assess closing APL valve anesthesia machine fresh gas flow 5 liters/minute audible leak observe . A stethoscope place stomach valve close listen gastric insufflation . Administration anesthetic medication muscle relaxant discretion anesthesiologist base clinical judgment and/or request surgeon . The anesthesia provider blind access monitor . The study deviate routine care choice LMA use randomize opening seal envelope prior start case . In addition , LMA place secure patient stable anesthetic point view , flexible fiberoptic camera place airway tube LMA view patient 's vocal cord relation cuff LMA assess . At conclusion case , patient breathe awake enough , judge anesthesia provider , LMA remove , would otherwise do standard care . The study LMA examine data collector presence grossly visible blood bile , presence absence record . In recovery area , patient fully awake , judged recovery staff , observer administer standard oral questionnaire patient determine sore throat , difficulty swallowing , difficulty speak present . The patient call 24 hour later data collector questionnaire administer .</detailed_description>
