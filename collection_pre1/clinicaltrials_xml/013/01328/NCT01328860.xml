	<brief_summary>The purpose research study : 1 . To see Bone Marrow Cell harvest transplantation safe child Spinal Cord Injury , 2 . To determine late functional outcome improve follow Bone Marrow Cell transplantation child Spinal Cord Injury , use pre-transplantation spinal cord function control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Stem Cells Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Of estimate 11,000 case acute spinal cord injury ( SCI ) occur year North America , 5 % involve child . The injury divide primary mechanical event cause injury , secondary event follow . Outcome SCI depend severity primary injury ( complete vs. incomplete ) spinal cord level injury . Current therapy design minimize secondary event SCI trauma-associated injury . Because current therapy nothing reverse primary insult , significant advance reduce disability associate SCI unlikely . Recent basic science animal study suggest stem cell treatment foster functional improvement SCI help repair primary injury reduce secondary injury . Stem cell `` unspecialized '' cell body specific function yet ( example , become `` heart cell '' `` brain cell '' yet . ) Stem cell able divide develop mature , function-specific cell take place cell die , injured long function way suppose . Stem cell study lot ability possibility may use take place cell longer work different part body disease ( cancer , diabetes , heart disease ) . Stem cell find throughout body , common bone marrow , thick , spongy material inside bone . The primary objective study determine safety transplantation patient 's ( autologous ) Bone Marrow Progenitor Cells ( BMPC ) child SCI . The secondary objective determine functional , physiological anatomic outcome measure improve BMPC autologous transplantation child SCI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Between 1 year 15 year age day study BMPC infusion . 2 . Survived least six month PSCI , less 4 year post injury ( Â± 30 day ) , fix neurologic deficit relate injury time enrollment . 3 . Ability child understand speak English . 4 . Ability child caregiver travel Houston , Texas , stay least 4 day , return Followup visit ( patient responsible cost travel lodge Houston ) . 5 . Pediatric patient type spinal cord injury long spinal cord continuous MRI evaluation . This include paraplegic quadriplegic patient complete incomplete spinal cord injury . This include patient ASIA impairment scale A D. The clinical classification describe level motor/sensory function impair , degree impairment . ( i.e . C5 deltoid muscle intact biceps muscle group C5 level weak [ incomplete motor injury ] paralyze [ complete motor injury ] . A similar evaluation sensory function establish clinically . 1 . Lack informed consent . 2 . Uncorrected coagulopathy baseline period define : INR &gt; 1.4 ; PTT &gt; 35 sec ; PLT &lt; 100,000 . 3 . Preinjury history seizure disorder and/or neurological impairment patient would able participate age appropriate pain rating scale . 4 . A history prior SCI severe traumatic brain injury . 5 . Known history : Recently diagnose infection ( within past 2 week ) require treatment and/or medical intervention . Renal disease alter renal function define serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL . Hepatic disease alter liver function define SGPT &gt; 150 U/L , and/or T. Bilirubin &gt; 1.3 mg/dL . Malignancy . Immunosuppression define WBC &lt; 3 ( 10x3 ) screen and/or baseline evaluation lab . HIV . Hepatitis B C. 8 . Unhealed fracture wound include osteomyelitis . 9 . Pneumonia , chronic lung disease require oxygen . 10 . An anatomically discontinuous spinal cord diagnose CT MRI image . 11 . Positive urine pregnancy test ( urine pregnancy test routinely perform female childbearing potential , age 11 old . 12 . Participation concurrent intervention study . 13 . Desire organdonation event death . 14 . Unwillingness inability stay least four day follow BMPC infusion ( problem arise follow infusion ) return 30 day , 6 month followup visit , available 1 year , 2 year followup phone call .</criteria>
