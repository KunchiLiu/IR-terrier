	<brief_summary>Background : - Postpartum depression ( PPD ) serious syndrome resembles major depressive episode occur 10 % 20 % mother year follow delivery . Women histories major depressive disorder ( MDD ) increase risk PPD recurrent PPD subsequent pregnancy . One possible genetic vulnerability depression PPD particular BDNF gene . BDNF protein affect growth development brain cell , include help regulate mood . BDNF level show significantly low individual depression , include woman . Researchers interested study BDNF level hormone estrogen pregnant woman MDD risk develop PPD . Objectives : - To study connection BDNF protein hormonal level pregnant woman risk develop postpartum depression . Eligibility : - Women currently pregnant history major depressive disorder , either take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) take antidepressant . Design : - This study involve six visit course 12 month , first , second , third trimester ( possible ) well 1 week , 1 month , 3 month postpartum . Women allow participate point pregnancy , researcher interest recruit woman first trimester . - Participants screen physical examination medical history , blood sample , questionnaire history depressive episode . - At visit , participant complete number questionnaire depression symptom , sleep disturbance stress level . Participants also provide blood sample hormone test . - Participants become depressed study refer treat psychiatrist professional appropriate care treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postpartum depression ( PPD ) serious syndrome resembles major depressive episode occur 10-20 % mother year follow delivery . The etiology PPD involve psychological factor , environmental factor stress sleep deprivation , biological factor include hormonal change , social factor . Women histories major depression ( MDD ) increase risk PPD recurrent PPD subsequent pregnancy . No consistent hormonal abnormality find woman PPD , instead , may sensitive normal change hormone level postpartum time . One possible genetic vulnerability depression , particular PPD , brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) gene . BDNF important member neurotrophin family know affect neuronal outgrowth , differentiation , synaptic connectivity neuronal repair broad range neuronal cell type include serotonergic neuron . In human , serum BDNF level show significantly low patient depression , include woman . Interestingly , estrogen show upregulate expression BDNF gene animal , suggest BDNF could critical link woman hormonally related depressive symptom . In addition , serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) use treat depression know upregulate expression BDNF brain . Interestingly , link depression , perturb energy metabolism BDNF signal recently elucidate . In present study , NIA investigator measure level BDNF reproductive energy-regulating hormone serum sample subject enrol Dr. Jennifer Payne study PPD . All subject study enrol , evaluate serum sample collect Dr. Payne staff Johns Hopkins University School Medicine Dr. Payne already Johns Hopkins approve IRB protocol NA_0008149 . NIA Role : Coded serum sample send Dr. Mattson NIA facility . Data obtain analysis serum sample send Dr. Payne maintain database , analyzed elucidate relation level serum marker clinical genetic data acquire Dr. Payne .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Women currently pregnant history MDD . In order minimize heterogeneity sample , woman must currently take serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressant medication take antidepressant . We attempt recruit approximately 50 % category ( SSRI versus medication ) . If woman become depressed study refer treat psychiatrist give appropriate clinical care . We continue follow woman specify time course even place ( ) antidepressant medication course study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis bipolar disorder Current active suicidal ideation medical instability Active substance abuse dependence last 90 day .</criteria>
