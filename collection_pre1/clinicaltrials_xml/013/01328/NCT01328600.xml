	<brief_summary>Background : - Preeclampsia combination high blood pressure potentially life-threatening symptom . Preeclampsia occur 10 % pregnancy main cause maternal fetal death worldwide . Treatment often difficult , far specific effective therapy . Researchers study body system regulate blood pressure . They also study drug control certain blood chemical constrict blood vessel increase blood pressure . - DIGIBIND , drug lower blood pressure , use treat pre-eclampsia . Marinobufagenin ( MBG ) , chemical blood constricts blood vessel , show involved pre-eclampsia . But researcher still certain whether DIGIBIND use specifically target MBG . Researchers want find whether DIGIBIND act MBG specifically . This information may help develop good drug block MBG low blood pressure woman preeclampsia . Objectives : - To study whether blood pressure treatment drug DIGIBIND specifically act marinobufagenin level blood pregnant woman . Eligibility : - Women 18 50 year age 34 39 week pregnant preeclampsia . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood urine test . - Before delivery , participant provide blood sample test evaluation . - Following delivery , participant provide additional blood sample sample placenta test evaluation . - No additional treatment , apart standard care , provide part protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Marinobufagenin Target DIGIBIND Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia ( PE ) complicate 5 10 % pregnancy number one cause maternal fetal morbidity mortality worldwide . Nevertheless , specific highly effective therapy disorder exist . As illustrated therapeutic efficacy anti-digoxin antibody ( DIGIBIND ) preeclampsia , endogenous digitalis-like sodium pump ligands play important role pathogenesis syndrome . Previously , demonstrate level endogenous bufadienolide Na/KATPase inhibitor elevate patient PE , antibody marinobufagenin low blood pressure rat pregnancy-induced hypertension ex vivo reverse inhibition Na/K-ATPase erythrocytes patient PE . Most recently , develop three anti-MBG monoclonal antibody low blood pressure several rat experimental model . We propose pilot proof-of concept study aim demonstrate MBG target DIGIBIND preeclampsia . If successful , trial provide basis development clinically-usable anti-MBG monoclonal antibody . We hypothesize patient preeclampsia DIGIBIND induces vasorelaxation due blockade circulate MBG . The specific aim study demonstrate isolate perfused preeclamptic placenta ex vivo release MBG concentration sufficient induce vasoconstriction DIGIBIND reverse vasoconstriction induce placental perfusate , vasorelaxant effect DIGIBIND due blockade MBG . The study population pregnant woman ( 18-50 year ) , 34-39 week fetal gestational age preeclampsia The primary outcome study variable difference vascular tone isolate perfused cotyledon . The secondary outcome : ( ) degree MBG binding DIGIBIND different time point follow DIGIBIND administration , ( ii ) effect DIGIBIND activity Na/K-ATPase erythrocyte , ( iii ) ex vivo effect DIGIBIND vascular tone isolate placental lobe .</detailed_description>
