	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate role routine suction oropharynx delivery shoulder prevent breathe difficulty subsequent lung disease baby bear meconium stain amniotic fluid . Normally baby pass meconium utero . In response hypoxic stress baby may pass meconium birth likely candidate problem related meconium passage inhalation lead meconium aspiration syndrome ( MAS ) . It believe clear airway meconium time birth decrease risk MAS . It routine practice suction mouth , pharynx nose baby soon head infant deliver prior delivery shoulder follow tracheal intubation suction baby poor breathe effort clear airway meconium . however recent study show futility procedure prevent MAS along increase risk complication baby due suctioning . In view uncertainty regard effectiveness procedure resource poor country , investigator decide evaluate effect intrapartum-oropharyngeal suction prevent decrease incidence MAS baby .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Meconium passage newborn infant developmentally program event normally occur within first 24-48 hour birth . Intra uterine meconium passage near term term fetus associate feto-maternal stress factor and/or infection , whereas meconium passage post term pregnancy attribute gastro-intestinal maturity . Meconium stain amniotic fluid occur 12 % live birth per annuum . Aspiration meconium occur intra uterine life delivery first breath may result contribute respiratory pathology know meconium aspiration syndrome ( MAS ) represent leading cause perinatal morbidity , occur 5-20 % baby bear MSAF . Several study show clear airway meconium time birth , meconium aspiration pneumonia virtually eliminate . Based result , American Heart Association American Academy Pediatrics recommend combined obstetric pediatric approach infant MSAF year 2000 . As per approach infant mouth , pharynx nose suction soon head infant deliver prior delivery shoulder use 10 french catheter follow tracheal intubation suction non-vigorous infant clear airway meconium . Accumulating evidence form large RCT develop world show futility intrapartum-oropharyngeal suction lead , omission procedure resuscitation guideline publish year 2005 . Even though International Liaison Committee Resuscitation recommend need IP- OP suction base single RCT conduct developed world universal institutional delivery strict fetal surveillance , may true set ups unbooked late second stage arrival mother prolong fetal distress virtually perinatal surveillance . Hence purpose randomize controlled trial evaluate effectiveness intrapartum-oropharyngeal suction prevent decrease incidence MAS term neonate bear MSAF resource poor set develop country .</detailed_description>
