	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 , open-label , multicenter study evaluate safety PK profile ABT-199 daily dosing schedule . Two arm implement dose escalation : Arm A , CLL/SLL subject Arm B , NHL subject . Arm A design enroll approximately 116 subject relapse refractory CLL SLL Arm B design enroll approximately 95 subject relapse refractory NHL . Fifty-six subject enrol Arm A approximately 55 subject enrol Arm B dose escalation portion study , objective define dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) MTD . Once MTD declare arm , approximately 60 additional CLL/SLL subject Arm A approximately 20 additional DLBCL subject 20 additional follicular lymphoma subject Arm B enrol expand safety portion study recommend phase 2 dose ( RPTD ) schedule .</brief_summary>
