	<brief_summary>Main Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize measurement lingual tonsil tissue ( LTT ) thickness decrease follow treatment daily oral dexlansoprazole 60 mg patient diagnose laryngopharyngeal reflux ( LPR ) lingual tonsil hypertrophy ( LTH ) compare matched control receive placebo . Primary endpoint include : - 24-hour oropharyngeal pH testing , pre- post-treatment - Mean lingual tonsil tissue ( LTT ) thickness , pre- post-treatment , determine CT scan base tongue Secondary endpoint include : - Reflux Finding Score ( RFS ) pre- post-treatment endoscopy oropharynx - Subjective outcome metric assess LPR-related symptom associate quality life - Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index - Bed-partner assessment snore intensity accord Visual Analog Scale - Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) - Reflux Symptom Index ( RSI ) Specific Aims : The primary objective study determine whether treatment patient diagnose LPR LTH 3 month PPI therapy reduces LTT thickness , measure CT scan tongue base . The secondary objective study : - Evaluate change LPR-related symptom quality life therapy use follow subjective outcome metric : - Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index - Bed-partner assessment snore intensity accord Visual Analog Scale - Epworth Sleepiness Scale - Reflux symptom index - Correlate change LTT thickness follow secondary endpoint : - Changes subjective outcome metric - Changes endoscopic finding LPR - Changes 24-hour oropharyngeal pH study result</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE : Detail : The backflow gastric content esophagus occur healthy people limited extent . [ 1 ] When refluxed material transcends upper esophageal sphincter enters laryngopharynx chronic basis , term laryngopharyngeal reflux ( LPR ) . LPR typically manifest dysphonia , globus sensation , chronic cough , throat irritation . Recent study suggest untreated LPR may cause lingual tonsil hypertrophy ( LTH ) , [ 2,3 ] implicate contribute factor obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome ( OSAHS ) . [ 4-6 ] Lingual tonsil tissue ( LTT ) present variable degree individual tend regress age . Although standardized parameter define LTH yet establish , recent study Friedman et al [ 7 ] demonstrate average subject LPR , OSAHS , diseases significantly thick LTT CT image patient without either disease . Del Gaudio coworkers [ 2 ] identify trend increase severity LTH frequency reflux event , Mamede et al [ 3 ] find positive correlation reflux symptom degree LTH . LTH set LPR think result edema inflammation bring chronic exposure tissue refluxed acid . The result thicken inflamed LTT may narrow retrolingual airway , increase likelihood airway obstruction apneic event . Theoretically , increase negative intrathoracic pressure secondary obstruction may , turn , facilitate LPR . While treatment reflux show decrease index OSAHS severity patient , [ 8-10 ] direct causal relationship LPR OSAHS proven . Similarly , evidence necessary elucidate exact relationship LPR LTH . No study date investigate whether treatment LPR reduce LTH . The investigator hypothesize adequate treatment LPR use PPI patient LTH result significant reduction LTT thickness well improvement OSAHS symptom , present . The propose study randomize , double-blind , control trial determine whether control LPR reduce LTH , corollary , improve OSAHS symptom . Control LPR determine 24-hour oropharyngeal pH monitoring [ 11 ] , LTH measure CT . While length time require LTH regression occur currently know , Reichel et al find 3 month PPI therapy typically necessary improvement LPR see . [ 12 ] Similarly , study Park et al show significantly great rate improvement resolution LPR symptom treatment PPI longer 2 month . [ 13 ] PRELIMINARY STUDIES Preliminary Studies : In previous study , investigator utilize axial sagittal CT image tongue base measure LTT patient LPR , OSAHS , condition , neither disease . The investigator find patient LPR , OSAHS , LPR+OSAHS significantly thicker LTT patient without LPR OSAHS . This study present 2009 Annual Meeting American Academy Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery publish April 2010 issue journal Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Overview : Prospective , randomize , double-blind , control study tertiary , university-affiliated medical center . Sample size : In order achieve power 0.95 , sample size 40 subject per group ( 80 total ) determine base priori power analysis . The sample size state original concept estimate determine statistically . Procedures : The study protocol begin patient diagnosed laryngopharyngeal reflux ( LPR ) basis routine history , physical exam , diagnostic study include 24-hour oropharyngeal pH monitor Dx-pH Monitoring System ( Restech , San Diego , California ) . Prospective candidate study ask undergo CT image tongue base . Those subsequently diagnose lingual tonsil hypertrophy ( LTH ) , determine mean lingual tonsil tissue ( LTT ) thickness great 3.0 mm axial sagittal view , eligible enrollment , provide meet additional inclusion criterion list . The enrollment period expect last 12 month , total duration study expect 18 month . Once eligible patient agree participate study provide informed consent , s/he randomly assign experimental control group accord 1:1 ratio . Patients well practitioner administer treatment blind patient group assignment . Patients experimental group start 3-month regimen daily oral dexlansoprazole 60 mg . Patients control group receive placebo daily mouth length time . Following completion 3-month treatment regimen , patient group undergo repeat 24-hour oropharyngeal pH test CT tongue base . Endoscopic finding LPR also record , monthly treatment treatment use Reflux Finding Score ( RFS ) . A 3-month treatment period choose base previous study , show failure symptom resolution short lengths time . Once enrolled , patient see clinic approximately every four week . Treatment cimetidine 200 mg PO BID offer rescue medication patient either group whose LPR symptoms worsen study . Once start , cimetidine , well study drug ( dexlansoprazole placebo ) continue duration study . At study conclusion , patient re-evaluated continued treatment , base effectiveness dexlansoprazole ( unblinding ) need rescue medication ( dexlansoprazole placebo ) . If cimetidine fail offer relief , subject withdrawn study treatment option offer . The Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index ( CSAQLI ) , visual analog scale snoring ( VAS ) , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) use subjective outcome metric . These questionnaire validate tool assess symptom obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome ( OSAHS ) associate quality life . The Reflux Symptom Index ( RSI ) , validate instrument assess reflux symptom , also administer along questionnaire prior initiate therapy end 3-month period . Data analysis Interpretation : Statistical analysis focus determine whether lingual tonsil tissue size differs therapy . Mean lingual tonsil tissue size calculate along standard deviation student test use determine statistical significance . Analysis also examine mean change four subjective metric , ( 1 ) Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index , ( 2 ) Visual Analog Scale snoring , ( 3 ) Epworth Sleepiness scale , ( 4 ) Reflux Symptom Index . Again , mean standard deviation calculate student test use assess statistical significance .</detailed_description>
