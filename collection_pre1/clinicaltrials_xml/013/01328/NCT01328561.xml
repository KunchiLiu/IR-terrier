	<brief_summary>Background : - Oxytocin , substance produce mostly brain , play role influence social interaction reaction stress , may relate pain . Arginine vasopressin , hormone regulates water , sugar , salt blood , influence hostile behavior reaction stress , may also relate pain . Researchers interested investigating substance relationship pain healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To evaluate effect oxytocin arginine vasopressin pain healthy volunteer . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 55 year age . Design : - This study involve two 2-hour test session hold 1 day apart . Each session include administration oxytocin , arginine vasopressin , placebo ( nonactive substance ) , drug . The drug placebo give nasal spray . - At first visit , participant provide blood saliva sample measure hormone level , ask fill questionnaire psychological factor anxiety empathy . Participants assessment sensitivity pain , consist brief electrical stimulation last less 1 second . After pain assessment , participant receive oxytocin , arginine vasopressin , placebo , drug , monitor provide baseline information . Participants another pain sensitivity test complete questionnaire , provide another saliva sample . - At second visit , participant provide another saliva sample ; receive oxytocin , arginine vasopressin , placebo , drug ; test pain sensitivity pain-relieving procedure . During pain-relieving procedure , participant receive brief , moderately painful electrical shock back nondominant hand low-level electrical stimulation middle finger counteracts reduce pain shock . Participants rate pain perception end stimulation use visual scale range 0 ( pain ) 10 ( maximum imaginable pain ) . The experiment end final saliva collection completion psychological questionnaire ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : It well know social contextual cue whole atmosphere around patient , word , attitude , provider behavior , contribute evoke placebo response . Moreover , extensive literature investigate prosocial behavior ( e.g . ability share another feeling , imitation , mimicry ) suggest social model critical develop learning process across specie , include social influence psychophysical aspect pain . Only recently , demonstrate observe beneficial effect demonstrator induce substantial placebo analgesic response positively correlate empathy . A crucial role social behavior play oxytocin ( OXT ) arginine vasopressin ( AVP ) , two neuropeptides , produce mostly hypothalamus act certain brain region whose function associate emotion perception ( amygdale nucleus accumbens ) , eye-gaze , trust processing positive negative social cue . Since belief , trust contextual cue important element clinicianpatient relationship socially-induced placebo effect , reasonable hypothesize OXT AVP may one endogenous substance trigger contextual interpersonal placebo response . By view interpersonal healing central causal process ( set relate causal process ) within domain pain modulation , possible probe potential role OXT AVP modulation placebo response . In pursuit goal , use neuropharmacological intervention OXT AVP agonists combination behavioral , brain imaging genetic approach . Study population : Healthy men woman participant age 18 55 year . Design : We investigate role oxytocinergic system process social cue use model pain interpersonal placebo analgesia already test ( 9 ) . The following drug use : 1 ) oxytocin , 2 ) arginine vasopressin , 3 ) placebo . Outcome measure : Primary outcome subjective pain report ( Experiment 1 ) brain- cortical -related response ( Experiments 2 3 ) . Secondary measure include skin conductance response , heart rate , cortisol , subjective measure empathy ; trait state anxiety measure ; functional pain-related genetic polymorphism .</detailed_description>
