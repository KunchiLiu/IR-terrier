	<brief_summary>This study do evaluate zoster vaccine response nursing home elderly ( 80 year old ) . As immune system age , response vaccine always strong young people . Previous zoster vaccine study exclude nursing home resident vaccine effect population know . Furthermore , immune genetic reason vaccine work well people others also unknown . The goal study evaluate immune system respond well vaccine others .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Deleterious change immunity occur age know immunosenescence . Such change , particularly adaptive immunity , may lead impaired vaccine response elderly . Characterizing immune determinant genetic basis vaccine response frail elderly practical approach well understanding immunosenescence . Data genetic determinant immunization sparse , furthermore , best knowledge , none exist elderly . In pilot study , propose study immune response herpes zoster vaccine underlying genetic determinant immune response elderly resident nurse home . The three specific aim study generate data order 1 ) assess T-cell response varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) vaccine frail elderly ; 2 ) ass whether immune ( T-cell ) phenotypes associate response ; 3 ) test association immune response genotype set T-cell response . We hypothesize response VZV vaccine elderly nonambulatory nursing home resident function characteristic T-cell immune phenotype prior vaccination immune genetic polymorphism associate response . This study allow u generate preliminary data establish feasibility order address question fully large population subsequent grant application .</detailed_description>
