	<brief_summary>We explore unique weight-training program men woman 55 year old knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) emphasize high-speed movement . We believe speed muscle move may important improvement muscle performance , function pain strong muscle . We compare high-speed power train traditional strength training determine method great effect muscle strength , muscle power , speed movement , functional performance pain . We believe high-speed training improve measure great extent simply train increase muscle strength .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study compare 12 week explosive high-speed power train traditional slow-speed strength training . Outcome measure include muscle performance : leg press ( LP ) knee extension ( KE ) one-repetition maximum ( 1RM ) LP peak power ( PP ) , velocity peak power ( PPV ) force peak power ( PPF ) 40 % -90 % 1RM . Measures function consist 400-meter walk ( 400-m W ) , Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) , time chair rise ( TCR ) self-reported function pain use WOMAC . Participants report laboratory 2 week baseline measurement . On visit 1 , subject explain study complete informed consent document . On visit 2 3 , muscle performance functional measure obtain . The following week , muscle performance functional measure repeat establish reliability . At end baseline testing , participant randomize treatment . Following 12-week RT intervention , post-training muscle performance functional measure obtain . Resistance Training Protocol . Volunteers randomize high-speed power training ( HSPT ) slow-speed strength training ( SSST ) exercise 3 time per week 12 week use computer-interfaced Keiser a420 pneumatic leg press knee extension RT equipment ( Fresno , CA ) . For HSPT , train session consist 3 set 12-14 repetition 40 % 1RM . Participants perform explosive movement high speed concentric phase repetition , pause one-second , perform eccentric portion contraction 2 second . Volunteers randomize SSST also exercise 3 time per week 12 week train session consist 3 set 8-10 repetition 80 % 1RM . The participant perform movement slow velocity ( 2 concentric phase repetition ) , pause one second , perform eccentric portion contraction 2 second . CON meet three time week warm-up stretching exercise , perform RT . HSPT SSST participate warm-up stretching exercise CON . Measures Maximal strength power . Leg press seat knee extension 1RM obtain use Keiser pneumatic RT equipment fit a420 electronics . The seat recumbent LP KE apparatus position place hip knee joint 90 100 degree flexion . The 1RM obtain progressively increase resistance subject longer able push one repetition successfully . The Borg Scale use assist evaluate 1RM ( combine perceive maximal effort ) reach . Peak muscle power obtain 40 % , 50 % , 60 % , 70 % , 80 % 90 % 1RM approximately 30 minute 1RM test ( 8,9 ) . Participants instruct exert `` fast possible '' relative percentage 1RM . Three attempt make resistance great PP output obtain resistance use analysis . The corresponding PPV PPF obtain external resistance 40 % -90 % 1RM . The 1RM measure bi-weekly HSPT SSST relative training intensity adjust accordingly ensure adequate overload training . Post-training muscle performance measure obtain use load relative initial baseline 1RM well post-training 1RM . 400 meter self-paced walk ( 400-m W ) . Participants instruct walk pace could maintain without overexert complete 400-m W could longer continue . Standardized verbal encouragement give 30-second interval walk . Participants take longer 15 minute complete 400-m W consider unable successfully perform test . Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) . The BBS consist 14 test balance score 0-4 scale sum obtain aggregate balance score ( range=0-56 ) . Timed Chair Rise ( TCR ) . Volunteers place folded arm across chest stand sit position initial assessment . If subject able accomplish task , ask complete time bout five repetition instruction complete activity fast . Subjects complete activity armless chair ( height seat 43.18 cm ) . TCR report number repetition per minute calculate time required complete five chair stand . WOMAC Function Pain . Self-reported function assess WOMAC function subscale , 17-item Likert scale questionnaire ( 0=none , 1=mild , 2=moderate , 3=severe , 4=extreme ) pain assess WOMAC pain subscale , 5-item Likert scale questionnaire ( 0=none , 1=mild , 2=moderate , 3=severe , 4=extreme ) . Self-reported function represent summation component item score ( range : 0-68 ; high score indicate great functional loss ) pain represent summation component item score ( range : 0-20 ; high score indicate great level pain ) .</detailed_description>
