	<brief_summary>Background : - Moderate aplastic anemia blood disease may require frequent blood platelet transfusion . Sometimes patient disease treat immunosuppressive drug . Not patient respond patient suitable treatment . - Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) protein make body . The bone marrow need TPO produce platelet . TPO may also able stimulate bone marrow stem cell produce red cell white cell . However , TPO give mouth . This lead researcher develop drug eltrombopag , act way give mouth . Eltrombopag show safely increase platelet number healthy volunteer patient chronic blood disease , include severe aplastic anemia . Researchers interested look whether eltrombopag give people moderate aplastic anemia significantly low blood cell count . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness eltrombopag people moderate aplastic anemia patient bone marrow failure unilineage cytopeniawho need treatment significantly low blood cell count . Eligibility : - People least 2 year age moderate aplastic anemia bone marrow failure unilineage cytopenia , significantly low blood cell count . Design : - Patients screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , bone marrow biopsy , eye exam . - Patients receive eltrombopag mouth day . - Patients weekly blood test monitor effectiveness treatment adjust dose response possible side effect . - Patients may continue take eltrombopag platelet count hemoglobin increase , requirement platelet blood transfusion decrease 16 20 week treatment , serious side effect . Access drug continue study close . Patients ask return follow-up visit 6 month last dose medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Moderate aplastic anemia ( MAA ) blood disease effectively treat immunosuppressive drug regimen . However , significant number patient persistent cytopenia . Currently , treatment patient regular transfusion , expensive , inconvenient , associate serious side effect relate iron overload , cytokine erythropoietin G-CSF , expensive , effective many patient . Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) protein make body important normal production platelet bone marrow . TPO may also able stimulate bone marrow stem cell produce red cell white cell . TPO give mouth , alternative , drug , eltrombopag , design act way TPO stable active give mouth . Eltrombopag show safely increase platelet number healthy volunteer patient chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) . It recently grant accelerated approval FDA November 20 , 2008 treatment patient chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) insufficient response standard therapy . We previously show encouraging result eltrombopag used treat patient severe aplastic anemia , patient respond increase platelet , red cell white cell . Given encourage early preliminary result clinical trial use eltrombopag SAA , low toxicity ease administration drug , propose non-randomized pilot phase II study eltrombopag moderate aplastic anemia patient clinically significant thrombocytopenia anemia . Patients MAA may reach criterion SAA , none less may transfusion-dependent significant symptom cytopenia . We hypothesize patient MAA compare SAA may better chance response , due well residual marrow function MAA patient compare SAA . Eligible patient treat untreated MAA , well count meeting criterion MAA follow partial response treatment immunosupression SAA . We also include patient bone marrow failure unilineage cytopenia . Treatment response platelet lineage define platelet count increase 20,000/microL baseline 16 20 week , freedom platelet transfusion great equal 8 week transfusion-dependent patient . For patient anemia ( untransfused hemoglobin less equal 8.5 g/dL ) , treatment response increase Hb great equal 1.5g/dl four month , measure least 2 serial measurement sustain 1 month without transfusion support OR transfusion dependent patient , reduction unit RCC transfuse 50 percent/8 week compare pretreatment transfusion number previous 8 week transfusion independence ( transfusion great equal 8 week ) . Subjects evidence clinical response lineage 16 week yet meet full primary endpoint response criterion , tolerate investigational treatment , may receive additional 4 week eltrombopag reassess 20 week . At time , meet primary endpoint response criterion , eligible enter extend access part study . If meet primary endpoint response criterion , eltrombopag discontinue . The primary objective ass safety efficacy oral thrombopoietin receptor agonist ( TPO-R agonist ) eltrombopag moderate aplastic anemia patient patient bone marrow failure unilineage cytopenia . Secondary objective include analysis incidence severity bleeding , clonal evolution PNH , clonal chromosomal population bone marrow , myelodysplasia morphology , acute leukemia impact quality life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Current diagnosis moderate aplastic anemia unilineage bone marrow failure disorder . Moderate aplastic anemia define aplastic anemia ( hypocellular bone marrow age ) evidence disease process cause marrow failure , depression least two three blood count normal value : ANC le equal 1200/mm ( 3 ) platelet count less equal 70,000/mm ( 3 ) anemia hemoglobin less equal 8.5 g/dL absolute reticulocyte count less equal 60,000/mm ( 3 ) transfusiondependent patient fulfil criterion severe disease define depression two three peripheral count : ANC le equal 500/mm ( 3 ) platelet count less equal 20,000/mm ( 3 ) reticulocyte count less equal 60,000/mm ( 3 ) Unilineage bone marrow failure disorder define : Hemoglobin le 8.5 g/dL reticulocyte count le 60,000 red cell transfusion dependent hypocellular normocellular bone marrow age significantly reduce erythroid precursor . OR thrombocytopenia less equal 30,000/uL platelet transfussion dependent hypocellular normocellular bone marrow age reduce megakaryocyte . No evidence viral drug supression marrow , dysplasia , underproduction anemia secondary B12 , folate , iron reversible cause . Platelet transfusion dependent define need platelet transfusion due platelet count &lt; 10,000/microL bleeding ( prophylactic transfusion ) &lt; 20,000/microL bleeding ( therapeutic transfusion ) . Red cell transfusion dependent define transfusion great 4 unit blood 8 week prior study entry .

Unable understand investigational nature study give inform consent legally authorize representative surrogate provide inform consent Moribund status concurrent hepatic , renal , cardiac , neurologic , pulmonary , infectious , metabolic disease severity would preclude patient 's ability tolerate protocol therapy , death within 710 day likely . Treatment horse rabbit ATG Campath within 6 month study entry . Treatment cytokine GCSF Erythropoeitin . Subjects know cirrhosis severity would preclude tolerability eltrombopag evidence albumin less 35g/L .
