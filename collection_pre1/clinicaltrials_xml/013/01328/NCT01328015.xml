	<brief_summary>A study experimental treatment procedure compare standard ( control ) treatment , The use oxybutynin late postoperative thoracic sympathectomy woman : 1 . To Evaluate effect oxybutynin plantar hyperhidrosis . 2 . To evaluate effect oxybutynin compensatory hyperhidrosis . 3 . To compare result questionnaires quality life specific hyperhidrosis result TEWL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Compare Oxybutynin Placebo Women Effect Plantar Hyperhidrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sweating important mechanism body regulate body temperature , keep around 36ºC . The thermoregulatory center hypothalamus capture data blood pass brain also receptors skin . Sweat response thermal variation , may also appear situation anxiety stress . The sweating occur rest ambient temperature great 24ºC . The sweat glands great number locate palm , sol , face underarms . Specifically , region , gland also influence psychological factor , different gland locate back abdomen respond heat . The hyperhidrosis relatively common disorder , affect 0.6 1 % population . It characterize increase sweat certain area body hand , face , foot armpit . More frequent young adult adolescent , mostly females . This serious illness life threatening , situation uncomfortable , cause deep embarrassment social relationship psychological disorder carrier , often isolate socially acquire habit conceal problem . Primary hyperhydrosis common indication performance thoracic sympathectomy . Videothoracoscopic sympathectomy perform treatment palmar hyperhidrosis , axillary cranial-facial , improvement range 80 95 % . Patients plantar sweat associate hyperhidrosis may remain even operation . Moreover , compensatory effect occur patient ( 70 % ) , sweat abdomen back , among others . The plant alleviate hyperhidrosis thoracic sympathectomy 50 % patient , mechanism yet understand . The persistence sweat locate source frequent complaint postoperatively , spatially specific occasion wear sandal , slipper go barefoot . The diagnosis hyperhidrosis exclusively clinical , base complaint patient limitation different area - social , labor , emotional psychological . No need examination determine existence disease . Faced , assessment treatment , also make subjectively , ie base patient 's opinion especially degree satisfaction . In attempt improve kind response treatment , specific questionnaire develop important complaint frequent , question treatment . Currently investigators several questionnaire assess treatment hyperhidrosis , diagnosis . With technological advance , device use determine flow evaporation skin - call capacitance hygrometry analysis transdermal water loss , know acronym English TEWL . This currently promise method objective measurement sweat , also use cosmetic company new product research ( 31,32 ) . The value determine gram per square meter per hour ( g/m2/h ) . Still data literature define limit TEWL application real hyperhidrosis . But study compare questionnaire mainly specific quality life objective measure amount sweat post-treatment There drug class specific use treatment hyperhidrosis . Groups anticholinergic medication , beta-blockers psychotropic drug may lead decreased sweating , satisfactorily without support literature . Oxybutynin parasympatholytics relaxant effect bladder detrusor muscle action muscarinic antagonist . The classic indication urinary incontinence . The use anticholinergic oral drug hyperhidrosis unknown experience oxybutynin restrict . The literature support assertion , case report . Its use limited U.S. Europe treatment hyperhidrosis . Even without consensus , common administration oxybutynin treatment hyperhidrosis , empirical base personal knowledge . Objective : To evaluate efficacy oxybutynin treatment plantar hyperhidrosis impact quality life woman already do thoracic sympathectomy . Method The sample population select telephone and/or e-mail patient late postoperative ( six month ) thoracic sympathectomy . Method evaluation research : Specific questionnaire plantar hyperhidrosis Questionnaire quality life hyperhidrosis Measurement sweat TEWL . Evaluations hold division group four week treatment . The data collect : age , length postoperative BMI side effect medication . Patients divide two group - placebo oxybutynin group . Study randomize clinical trial placebo . The intervention use oxybutynin four week dosage : Dosage : ½ cp oral 12/12h 3 day 01 ½ cp oral morning even 3 day Continue 1 cp oral 2x/day three week . Besides focus plant hyperhidrosis , compensatory sweating also evaluate parameter , secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
