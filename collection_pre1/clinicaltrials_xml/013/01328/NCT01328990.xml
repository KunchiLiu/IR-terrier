	<brief_summary>The aim study determine pharmacokinetic profile sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine plus amodiaquine ( SP+AQ ) use seasonal Intermittent Preventive Treatment ( IPT ) prevent malaria child age 3 59 month Lamarame , NDoffane District , Senegal . Several study show seasonal IPT child provide high degree protection clinical malaria . SP+AQ effective regimen . However little known pharmacokinetics amodiaquine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine child . The purpose study determine pharmacokinetics profile SP+AQ use IPT Senegalese child . 150 child age 3 59 month enrol November . They receive therapeutic dose sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine amodiaquine , follow 30 day . Four finger prick blood sample take child PK analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine Plus Amodiaquine Intermittent Preventive Treatment Children ( IPTc )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SP+AQ effective regimen IPT child , little information pharmacokinetics drug child . Although combination use many year treatment clinical malaria study pharmacokinetics combination . A recent study describe pharmacokinetics amodiaquine use combination artesunate treat child clinical malaria ( Stepniewska et al , 2009 ) , another recent study describe pharmacokinetics SP child malaria ( Barnes et al , 2006 ) , study SP child uncomplicated malaria demonstrate low plasma level drug child fail treatment ( Obua et al . 2008 ) , study drug give together healthy child . This information important order check bioavailability two drug use IPT check adequacy currently recommend dosage . The study conduct rural district Senegal , hold community meeting explain study . 150 child age 1-5 year , boys girls history allergy study drug whose parent agree participate enrol study clinic . The sample size determination base experience PK study . During study organization phase , meeting hold health facility , member community , community leader , health staff invite attend , investigator explain , local language , aim study , recruitment follow procedure , total sample size need , duration follow . The detailed schedule blood sampling explain . Subsequently investigator visit family home explain study invite people attend clinic . Mothers carers ask bring child clinic , sign indicate consent , child weigh clinical examination , finger prick blood sample take draw blood vacutainer , 70ÂµL blood pipetted onto filter paper . SP first dose AQ administer accord child 's weight , child keep observation 30 minute allow return home . The remain dos amodiaquine ( day 1 2 ) give field worker visit child home supervise drug administration . The exact time administration record . Any child vomit dose give repeat dose . The child ask provide finger prick blood sample three occasion day 1 day 28 , determine accord schedule choose allow good estimation PK parameter . Trained field staff visit child day 4 , ask adverse reaction drug , day 14 28 check child well . Children sign severe malaria , severe illness , refer immediately health post . For child , child axillary temp &gt; =37.5oC history fever last 48 hour finger prick blood sample take malaria diagnosis rapid test blood film read later . Children positive test treat Coartem .</detailed_description>
