	<brief_summary>Remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) occur tissue ( ex . heart ) become less vulnerable ischemic insult remote tissue ( ex . arm ) previous exposure period ischemia reperfusion . A beneficial effect RIPC demonstrate several randomized study patient undergo cardiac vascular surgery , well interventional cardiac procedure angioplasty . They show improvement cardiac , renal , neurologic respiratory function . Most focused surrogate outcome , biochemical marker cardiac renal function low-risk patient . No trial investigate high-risk patient design detect clinical outcome . This study randomized-controlled trial power detect clinical event high-risk cohort undergo cardiovascular surgery . Patients randomized RIPC ( expose cycle inflation blood pressure cuff upper arm prior undergoing surgery ) control ( ischemic stimulus ) . The investigator hypothesize population demonstrate lower rate adverse ischemic event . The investigator also intend sample biochemical marker well elucidate mechanism RIPC generate hypotheses future study intervention . Post-operatively investigator monitor adverse clinical outcome include cardiac , renal , pulmonary neurologic injury . RIPC simple , inexpensive easily reproducible report adverse consequence . Post-operative ischemic event stroke , myocardial infarction , cardiac , renal respiratory failure affect patient survival quality life , represent sizeable financial burden health care . If beneficial effect RIPC demonstrate , widely applicable entire population cardiac vascular patient result widely-implemented change practice .</brief_summary>
