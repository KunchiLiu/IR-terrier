	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study individualize temozolomide ( TMZ ) treat patient stage IV melanoma remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , TMZ , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving TMZ different time , determine individually patient base phase ( biorhythm ) immune system response tumor may allow good drug response may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Individualized Temozolomide Treating Patients With Stage IV Melanoma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical activity time administration TMZ therapy patient stage IV melanoma receive prior chemotherapy metastatic melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity profile time administration TMZ therapy patient stage IV melanoma receive prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . II . To evaluate parameter immune homeostasis associate anti-tumor immune biorhythm order gain insight mechanism observe clinical immunological effect time TMZ chemotherapy . III . To evaluate impact time TMZ chemotherapy immune biomarkers anti-tumor immune biorhythms . OUTLINE : Prior initiation therapy patient undergo period immunologic monitoring analyze bioperiodicity anti-tumor immune response . Patients establish biorhythm receive TMZ orally ( PO ) start recommend day 5 day . Treatment repeat every 21-42 day ( base establish biorhythm ) disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients without establish biorhythm give option go study receive TMZ PO day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
