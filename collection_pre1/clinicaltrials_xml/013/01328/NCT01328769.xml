	<detailed_description>Persons hypertension ( HTN ) often high uric acid normotensives , especially hypertensives metabolic syndrome.1-5 Recent prospective study also suggest person higher uric acid great risk develop hypertension.4-7 Uric acid childhood appear particularly predictive early-onset hypertension blood pressure later life.4 , 5 , 8 While many consider elevated uric acid merely marker increase renal sodium reabsorption , recent data suggest potentially causal role . Rats make mildly hyperuricemic treatment uricase inhibitor oxonic acid become hypertensive . The increase blood pressure rat block administration renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) blocker reduction uric acid allopurinol.9 More recently , febuxostat also show effective experimental model.10 Febuxostat recently approve FDA Uloric . Febuxostat xanthine oxidase ( XO ) inhibitor ( like old drug allopurinol ) , indicate chronic management hyperuricemia patient gout . The investigator report clear relationship high serum uric acid increase intrarenal angiotensin II assess intravenous angiotensin II ( Ang II ) infusion human subjects.11 In model , change renal blood flow response infuse Ang II serve indirect indicator renal vascular exposure endogenous Ang II . In set high endogenous intrarenal Ang II , renovascular AT1 receptor down-regulated normal reduction renal blood flow response infuse exogenous Ang II becomes blunt . The investigator find increase serum uric acid strongly correlate blunt normal response infuse Ang II . Other study colleague Boston demonstrate treatment ACE inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker restore normal responsiveness infuse Ang II hypertensives blunt response patient may particularly responsive RAS blockade.12-14 The study rat result association uric acid suggest elevate uric acid may cause increase intrarenal Ang II otherwise interact Ang II thereby promote hypertension . In study , investigator propose explore causality uric acid affect blood pressure , importantly , begin explore underlying mechanism response use unique protocol human subject . Recent result randomize cross-over study 30 hyperuricemic , hypertensive adolescent show allopurinol ( 200 mg twice daily ) result significant reduction blood pressure compare placebo.4 , 15 , 16 However , similar study adult lack study provide insight mechanism whereby uric acid might raise blood pressure human . Endothelial dysfunction consistently improve allopurinol treatment patient congestive heart failure17 , 18 several conditions.19 It would great scientific clinical interest mechanistic role uric acid adult hypertension could demonstrate . The investigator unique opportunity examine uric acid contributor overactivity intrarenal RAS impair nitric oxide production . The investigator hypothesize hypertensive elevate uric acid experience significant fall uric acid response administration febuxostat correlate improvement vascular response infuse Ang II , improve endothelial function . As part protocol investigator able assess effect febuxostat proximal distal sodium clearance use uric acid clearance surrogate proximal tubular sodium absorption . Uric acid reabsorption indirectly couple sodium reabsorption : anion enter proximal tubular cell via sodium-coupled electroneutral system anion exchange urate.20 Renal uric acid clearance directly closely correlated renal lithium clearance , well-validated measure proximal tubular sodium reabsorption , clearance use estimate proximal tubular sodium handle large , population-based studies,21 , 22 well measure acute response , example , insulin infusion,23 beta-blocker treatment,24 volume expansion.20 , 25 Other study find decrease proximal tubular uric acid lithium clearance associate positive family history hypertension26 adducin gene variant associate hypertension.27 In summary , investigator examine effect lower uric acid febuxostat intrarenal RAS activity measure renovascular response Ang II infusion , proximal tubular sodium absorption measure uric acid clearance . Potential effect endothelial function , arterial stiffness , blood pressure also test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Mild moderate hypertension . For purpose study , investigator define mild moderate hypertension 12 antihypertensive medication blood pressure &amp; lt ; 140 mm Hg systolic &amp; lt ; 90 mm Hg diastolic base mean seat blood pressure screen visit clinic . For visit , investigator measure blood pressure use Dinamap automatic oscillometric cuff subject seat quietly . The subject leave quiet room without speak 5 minute initially . The Dinamap start technician leaf room 3 blood pressure obtain interval 2 minute . The investigator use mean last 2 blood pressure classification purpose . This approach investigator use several multicenter study include HyperGEN NHLBI Family Heart Study . Age 18 60 . Uric acid =5.8 mg/dl . This mean uric acid among hypertensive prior study.11 As renal plasma flow response Ang II infusion decrease linearly high uric acid , investigator felt use high average uric acid provide great power . Severe poorly control hypertension ( treat blood pressure &amp; gt ; 160 mm Hg systolic &amp; gt ; 100 mm Hg diastolic ) . Diabetes ( type 1 type 2 ) . Estimated GFR &amp; lt ; 60 ml/min . Persons unable stop medication ( include antihypertensive ) stable dos thyroxine estrogen least 2 week . Secondary hypertension . Prior history clinically diagnose coronary artery disease congestive heart failure . Taking uric acid lower medication within 1 month screen visit .</criteria>
