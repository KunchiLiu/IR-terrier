	<brief_summary>Background : - Urothelial cancer ( tumor bladder , urethra , ureter , renal pelvis ) often respond initially standard chemotherapy treatment , frequently recur often spread part body . TRC105 , experimental drug block development new blood vessel need tumor growth , may able shrink stabilize urothelial cancer tumor . TRC105 give previously individual type cancer , researcher interest determine safety effectiveness treat urothelial cancer . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness TRC105 treatment metastatic urothelial cancer respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose urothelial cancer spread part body respond standard chemotherapy . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , tumor image study . - Participants receive TRC105 intravenously every 2 week day 1 15 28-day treatment cycle . The first dose TRC105 give 4-hour period ; participant side effect may receive next dose 2 hour . If second dose tolerate , subsequent dos give least 1 hour . - To help prevent known side effect TRC105 , participant take two dos ( one morning one evening ) steroid dexamethasone day infusion schedule . Participants may additional dexamethasone 30 minute infusion , may infusion slow stopped adjust side effect . - Participants monitor blood sample , physical examination , tumor image study cycle treatment . - Participants continue take TRC105 long treatment effective cancer long side effect severe enough stop treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TRC105 Adults With Advanced/Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - In United States , urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) bladder 4th common malignancy men 9th common woman estimate 70,980 new case 14,330 death year 2009 . Although chemosensitive response proportion 50 % conventional cytotoxic regimen , response duration short median survival patient metastatic disease approximately 14 month . - TRC105 genetically engineer human/murine chimeric monoclonal antibody inhibits angiogenesis tumor growth via endothelial cell growth inhibition apoptosis . TRC105 direct human CD105 ( endoglin ) , angiogenic membrane protein highly express proliferate vasculature solid tumor up-regulated follow anti-VEGF ( vascular endothelial growth factor ) therapy . Clinical study bladder cancer anti-angiogenic agent show anti-tumor activity . - TRC105 target unique mechanism tumor angiogenesis , modification CD105 signal . In patient advanced bladder cancer progress standard chemotherapy life prolong therapeutic option , use novel angiogenesis inhibitor may improve outcome . OBJECTIVES : - To measure PFS ( progression free survival ) TRC105 determine RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) v1.1 - To determine safety toxicity TRC105 patient population . - In addition , preliminary fashion , response rate overall survival patient metastatic urothelial carcinoma bladder treat TRC105 estimate . ELIGIBILITY : - Adults progressive advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma progress despite treatment prior cytotoxic chemotherapy . - Subjects must receive least one prior cytotoxic agent ( must include least one following : cisplatin , carboplatin , paclitaxel , docetaxel , gemcitabine ) . DESIGN : - TRC105 administer dose 15 mg/kg intravenously every two week , day 1 15 28 day cycle . - Patients may continue study long tolerate therapy free disease progression . - The study conduct two-stage optimal design ( Simon 1989 ) . With alpha=0.10 beta=0.10 acceptable error probability , trial target 30 % desirable proportion patient still without progression radiographic criterion approximately 6 month ( p1=0.30 ) , consider inadequate fraction consistent 10 % without progression evaluation time ( p0=0.10 ) . Initially 12 patient enrol followed progression . If 2 first 12 patient reach 6 month without progression , enrollment continue total 35 evaluable patient ( 37 total patient allow small number inevaluable patient ) enter .</detailed_description>

Or , appearance one new bone lesion . Patients must previously treat , define follow : Treatment least one prior cytotoxic agent ( must include least one following : cisplatin , carboplatin , paclitaxel , docetaxel , gemcitabine ) , administer perioperative metastatic setting may administer sequentially ( e.g. , firstline treatment follow secondline treatment time progression ) part single regimen . 18 year age old ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status &lt; 2 Karnofsky Performance Status great equal 60 % Resolution acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy , radiotherapy , surgical procedure NCI CTCAE ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ) grade less equal 1 baseline Adequate organ function define follow criterion : Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ( Aspartate transaminase ) ; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic ) ] ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ( alanine transaminase ) ; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [ SGPT ( serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ) ] ) less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; 5.0 time ULN case liver metastasis Total serum bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dL ( unless elevation Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome due slow conjugation bilirubin ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1000/microL Platelets great equal 100,000/microL Serum creatinine less equal 2.0 mg/dl calculate creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) great equal 30 mL/min Hemoglobin &gt; 9gm/dL PT ( prothrombin time ) , aPTT ( activate partial thromboplastin time ) must within normal range Patients anticoagulant may enrol long INR ( International normalize ratio ) exceed 3 .
