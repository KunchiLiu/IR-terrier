	<detailed_description>This study randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled study topical GW870086 explore potential skin thin healthy adult volunteer 42±2 day treatment . The primary objective study ass thickness skin use ultrasound . The secondary objective assess skin thin use visual scale skin atrophy telangiectasia , safety tolerability GW870086 ass pharmacokinetics GW870086 administer cream 42±2 day . Twenty ( 20 ) healthy volunteer randomise receive placebo GW870086 2 % cream . They also receive either follow treatment : GW870086 0.2 % cream , clobetasol propionate 0.05 % cream . Subjects apply 3 treatment daily 42±2 day treatment period . However subject randomise receive unblinded clobetasol propionate apply daily maximum 21±2 day continue dose 2 treatment . If significant evidence skin thin observed treatment arm ( 25 % reduction skin thickness measure use ultrasound ) application treatment discontinue . Three area approximately 5 x 5 cm arm identify treatment apply area throughout 42±2 day treatment period .</detailed_description>
