	<detailed_description>Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) condition develop reflux stomach content cause troublesome symptom and/or complication . It frequent problem upper gastrointestinal tract outpatient clinic contributes substantially morbidity cost . Endoscopy widely use modality diagnosis classification GERD , extent esophageal mucosal break endoscopy assess . However , half patient GERD reveal visible abnormality conventional endoscopy , possible minute mucosal change underestimate conventional endoscopy due limitation visual ability . In addition uncertainty detect mucosal break , uncertainty describe severity mucosal injury lead inconsistency among interpreter . Asian gastroenterologist tend diagnose endoscopically treat patient symptom suggestive GERD use modify Los Angeles ( LA ) classification system include minimal change constitute distinct grade reflux esophagitis . In modify LA system , minimal change esophagitis characterize mucosa erythema and/or whitish turbidity . However , substantial overlap note normal minimal change , minimal change LA class A , LA class A B , interobserver agreement regard diagnosis classification reflux esophagitis unsatisfactory apply daily practice . Thus , development new method define intra-esophageal injury use daily practice worthwhile endeavor . Currently , new image technology apply endoscopy improve detect differentiate subtle mucosal change use digital contrast method narrow−band imaging ( NBI ) , Fuji Intelligent Chromoen−doscopy ( FICE ) i-scan . Among , i-scan technology recently develop image enhance technology , consist three mode image enhancement , i.e . surface enhancement ( SE ) , contrast enhancement ( CE ) , tone enhancement ( TE ) . SE enhances light-dark contrast CE add blue color relatively dark area digitally , obtain luminance intensity data pixel . Applying SE CE might allow detailed observation subtle irregularity around surface TE analyze individual RGB component normal image recombines color frequency component enhance minute mucosal structure subtle color change . Thus , investigator examine hypothesis i-scan improve detection rate reflux esophagitis inter-observer agreement endoscopists compare conventional white light ( WL ) endoscopic examination</detailed_description>
