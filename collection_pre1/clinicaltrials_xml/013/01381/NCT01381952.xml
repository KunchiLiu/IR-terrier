	<brief_summary>ClarityIQ novel X-ray imaging technology , combine advance real-time image noise reduction algorithm , state-of-the-art hardware reduce patient entrance dose significantly . This realize anatomy-specific optimization full acquisition chain ( grid switch , beam filtering , pulse width , spot size , detector image processing engine ) every clinical task individually . Furthermore , small focal spot size short pulse use , know positively influence image quality . The final effect clinical image quality investigate study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The advent interventional neuroradiology ( INR ) change treatment neurovascular disease reduce procedural invasiveness recovery time need patient , thus improve clinical outcome . However , INR procedure often require many high-quality digital substraction angiography ( DSA ) run long total fluoroscopy time , result patient expose considerable radiation dos level . In order introduce dose reduction technology important aspect validate diagnostic image information . Philips develop real-time noise reduction algorithm DSA neuroradiology capable reduce patient entrance dose 75 % without loss image quality .</detailed_description>
