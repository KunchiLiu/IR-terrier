	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) primary malignant tumor liver account important health problem worldwide . In 10 % - 15 % patient HCC , tumor consider resectable presentation . In contrast metastatic liver disease , role systemic chemotherapy treatment HCC . Today evidence available Sorafenib , tyrosine kinase inhibit agent . The arsenal non-surgical therapy roughly divide local ablative , transarterial systemic therapy . In well select patient , local ablative therapy offer favorable long term result . For patient disease confine liver , locally advanced , transarterial treatment modality propose . These therapy exploit dual blood supply liver . HCC derive blood supply almost entirely hepatic artery , liver parenchyma derives &gt; 75 % blood supply portal vein . Antitumoral agent , cytotoxic drug radionuclides , deliver close proximity tumor . Examples transarterial therapy : transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , bland transarterial embolization ( TAE ) , transarterial chemoembolization drug elute bead ( TACE-DEB ) transarterial radioembolization Iodine-131 Yttrium-90 . TACE currently gold standard treatment patient intermediate stage HCC , report median survival around 17 month . A novel development TACE treatment HCC drug-eluting bead ( DEB ) . Recently perform small clinical trial report efficacy DEBs treatment intermediate stage HCC , substantially high compare conventional TACE . Yttrium-90 radioembolization ( 90Y-RE ) relatively recently develop technique implement transarterial administration minimally embolic microspheres load Yttrium-90 , Î²-emitting isotope , deliver selective internal radiation tumor . In study investigator want prospectively compare TACE-DEB 90Y-RE , two novel treatment theoretical and/or proven advantage compare use conventional TACE , patient intermediate stage HCC .</brief_summary>
