	<brief_summary>Background : -Tuberculosis ( TB ) infection lung cause bacteria . In Mali , TB diagnose test fast inexpensive always accurate . The purpose study test new method diagnose TB , call microscopic-observation drug-susceptibility ( MODS ) test . The MODS test take 7 day show result . The test also give information drug work best case . Objective : -To test new method diagnose tuberculosis call microscopic observation drug susceptibility test . Eligibility : - Participants must 12 year age old . - They must diagnosis TB sputum smear , symptom TB x-ray indicating TB present . Design : - Participants take part study 6 month 21 month assign one three group , depend type TB . - At first visit , researcher ask question general health symptom TB . They check vital sign , draw blood , ask sputum sample . The blood use check HIV infection number CD4 cell , measure severity HIV infection . - The 2- , 5- , 6-month visit similar first . Those multidrug-resistant ( MDR ) TB end participation 6-month visit . MDR TB tuberculosis respond isoniazid rifampicin . Participants MDR TB remain study 21 month . - No treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately one-third world population infect tuberculosis ( TB ) , 1 million death occur annually worldwide ( 1,2 ) . Accurate diagnosis TB drug susceptibility test necessary treat infection appropriately bring epidemic control . Inappropriate treatment TB , hand , lead recent spread multidrug-resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) , estimate affect half million people worldwide ( 2,4,5 ) . Sputum smear microscopy , diagnostic method commonly use develop country , sensitive detect TB culture-based technique utilize developed country . Furthermore , drug-susceptibility test routinely perform resource-limited setting . Consequently , many individual TB develop country treat inadequate regimen , MDR-TB continue spread . The microscopic-observation drug-sensitivity ( MODS ) assay recently develop rapid diagnosis TB simultaneous detection resistance first-line TB medication resource-limited setting ( 11 ) . MODS show sensitive traditional culturebased method detection TB , provide result drug susceptibility test highly concordant standard technique ( 10 ) . We propose study utility MODS assay diagnosis TB subject sputum-smear positive sputum-smear negative , chronic TB . Susceptibility test perform first-line antituberculous drug , subsequently , second-line drug , subject find MDR-TB . The first primary objective calculate sensitivity detection MODS assay , compare Middlebrook culture method , subject suspect TB sputum-smear positive microscopy . The second primary objective calculate concordance drug-susceptibility test MODS assay agar proportion method subject sputum-smear positive , sputum-smear negative , diagnosed chronic TB . Secondary objective include evaluate utility MODS assay diagnosis TB subject sputum-smear negative chronic TB , performance second-line drug-susceptibility test use MODS assay subject diagnose MDRTB , utility MODS assay diagnosis TB subject coinfected human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 -2 , ability MODS assay identify nontuberculous mycobacteria subject harbor organism .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals ( 12 year age ) meet follow criterion eligible enrollment study : Have sputum smear positive acidfast bacillus microscopy clinical symptom abnormal finding compatible active TB previously perform chest radiograph . Have either complete least 5 month treatment antituberculous therapy within past year receive antituberculous treatment precede 5 year . Willingness provide sputum sample study . Ability follow verbal instruction produce sputum . Willingness undergo test HIV . Willingness allow storage sample future research . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects meet follow criterion eligible enrollment study : Any condition investigator opinion place subject undue risk participate study . Subjects young 12 year age exclude study due difficulty obtain adequate sputum sample diagnosis TB population mean obtain gastric aspirate reference center .</criteria>
