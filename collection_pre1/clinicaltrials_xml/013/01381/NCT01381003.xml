	<brief_summary>Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) rare inherit disorder patient suffer severe infection inflammation . The first indication disease usually appear early childhood . The basic defect find lie specialised white blood cell call phagocytic cell , responsible engulf destroying germ . In CGD , defect enzyme ( know NADPH-oxidase ) responsible generate bleach like substance important kill important germ . In form disease know X-CGD ( account two third patient ) , define mistake gene call gp91-phox , key part NADPH-oxidase . In many case , patient protect infection constant intake antibiotic . However , others potential life-threatening infection break . In case patient also develop serious inflammation require high dos drug steroid . CGD cure bone marrow transplant , best result available matched donor available . Transplant unmatched donor much bad outcome . Gene therapy CGD perform introduce normal copy human gp91-phox gene blood form stem cell patient ' bone marrow use gene carrier ( study call lentiviral vector ) . After treatment bone marrow cell specialise laboratory give back patient grow functional phagocytic cell .</brief_summary>
