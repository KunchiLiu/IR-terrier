It contraindicate enrol female childbearing potential ; however , female childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test study entry must practice adequate contraception least 30 day prior study entry . Additionally , subject agree one follow method avoidance pregnancy entire study treatment period : Abstinence ; , Oral Contraceptive , either combine estrogen/progesterone progesterone alone , PLUS additional barrier method [ ie , condom , occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) vaginal spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) ] ; , Injectable progesterone ; Implants levonorgestrel ; , Estrogenic vaginal ring ; , Percutaneous contraceptive patch ; Intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) show failure rate le 1 % IUD IUS product label ; , Has male partner sterilize ( vasectomy documentation azoospermia ) . Double barrier method : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) vaginal spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) Females consider nonchildbearing potential document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal , define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 147 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] Subject evidence systemic inflammatory response believe related intraabdominal infectious process evidence another infectious source ( e.g. , catheter relate , lung , urinary tract ) Subject abnormal white blood cell count ( &gt; 12,000/µL &lt; 4,000/µL &gt; 10 % band ) PLUS one follow Fever , define &gt; 38°C oral , &gt; 38.5°C tympanic &gt; 39°C rectal , within last 24 hour Heart rate 90 beat per minute Respiratory rate 20 breath per minute PaCO2 level le 32 mm Hg Altered mental status think due infectious process Subject postop require surgery within last 24 hour prior first dose study medication OR subject require surgical intervention ( e.g. , laparotomy , laparoscopic surgery , percutaneous drainage abscess ) within 24 hour first dose study medication one presurgical dose antibiotic give preoperative prophylaxis . Subject know Gramnegative pathogen ( ) isolate prior study entry suspect Gramnegative postoperative infection fail prior Gram negative treatment regimen A subject enrol failure previous antibacterial treatment regimen must : Show lack improvement worsen sign symptom infection , include continued worsen peritoneal finding Require additional surgical intervention must perform within 24 hour first dose study medication one presurgical dose antibiotic give preoperative prophylaxis AND/OR Be postop require surgery within 24 hour prior first dose study medication one presurgical dose antibiotic give preoperative prophylaxis . Have culture positive Gramnegative pathogen ( intraabdominal site ) N.B . Such subject may enrol result culture know culture negative , subject must remove study drug therapy . Subject require antibacterial therapy anticipate duration 7 day , addition surgical intervention , one follow eligible diagnosis : Cholecystitis ( include gangrenous cholecystitis ) rupture , perforation progression infection beyond gallbladder wall Diverticular disease perforation abscess Appendiceal perforation duration symptom &gt; =48 hour AND image strongly suggestive free fluid abscess Acute gastric duodenal perforation , operate 24 hour perforation occur Traumatic perforation intestine operate 12 hour perforation occur Peritonitis due perforate viscus , postoperative , focus infection ( spontaneous bacterial peritonitis associate cirrhosis chronic ascites ) Inflammatory bowel disease ischemic bowel disease bowel perforation If preoperative , subject must peritoneal finding highly suspicious cIAI , define one following : Abdominal pain and/or tenderness Localized diffuse abdominal wall rigidity An imaging procedure , ie . ultrasound CT scan show evidence IAI Mass Ileus QTcB QTcF &lt; 450 msec ; QTc &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block Subject know suspected diagnosis following : Abdominal wall abscess Small bowel obstruction ischemic bowel disease without perforation Traumatic bowel perforation surgery within 12 hour Perforation gastroduodenal ulcer surgery within 24 hour Any intraabdominal process primary etiology likely infectious . Simple cholecystitis Gangrenous suppurative cholecystitis without rupture extension beyond gallbladder wall Simple appendicitis Acute suppurative cholangitis Infected , necrotizing pancreatitis , pancreatic abscess Subject must manage stag abdominal repair open abdominal technique Subject know study entry , prior randomization study medication , cIAI cause Grampositive pathogen pathogen resistant study antimicrobial agent .
