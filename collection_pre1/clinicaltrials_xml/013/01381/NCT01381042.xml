	<brief_summary>Previous study show active brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) present adult may play important role regulate energy homeostasis . However , majority study do patient undergo scan cancer surveillance , may reflect BAT behavior healthy individual . In addition , little know ethnic variation BAT activity , particularly Chinese adult . Due large amount cohort , able look difference subject cancer surveillance ( CS ) subject medical check-up ( MC ) , clarify impact clinical lifestyle parameter .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We study scan database include data July 2006 June 2010 Shanghai . BAT activity measure via 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) . Age , image date , sex , outdoor temperature collect patient . To evaluate effect multiple metabolic parameter BAT activity , collect height , body weight , fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) , medical history , diagnosis , smoking , alcohol consumption , exercise , liver triglyceride content , thyroid metabolic activity patient detectable BAT negative control , consist two patient underwent PET/CT scan day without detectable BAT .</detailed_description>
