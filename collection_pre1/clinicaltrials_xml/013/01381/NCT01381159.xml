	<detailed_description>Background : The high burden asthma , affect 300 million people worldwide , appear related poor asthma control , associate frequent asthma symptom , great bronchodilator use functional impairment , bad pulmonary function . The availability effective treatment suggest asthma well controlled patient . However , Canadian statistic reveal 58 % asthmatic poorly control . Achieving optimal asthma control rely upon several behavioral factor , include minimize exposure know trigger ( e.g. , pet , dust , pollen ) improve health behavior ( e.g , . quit smoke adhere medication ) . Of , daily adherence inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) regimens consider expert one important behavioral factor link achieve optimal asthma control . This take ICS medication prescribe ( i.e. , good adherence ) show effective achieve good asthma control even patient fail adequately manage/minimize exposure know trigger ( e.g. , indoor allergen , exercise ) . Despite efficacy ICS 's , recent trend adherence behaviour suggest asthmatic adherent medication , rate low 32 % , even patient severe asthma . Explanations range simply forget distorted/ erroneous illness medication belief . Currently , paucity research intervention specifically design improve ICS adherence among adult asthmatic . Most previous work conduct pediatric sample yield inconsistent result difficult generalize adult sample . Of study conduct among adult , suffer important methodological limitation ( e.g. , small sample size , intent treat analysis , failure control contact time , objective measure adherence ) make difficult either generalize finding interpret confidence . Most importantly , vast majority intervention study date use atheoretical intervention target behaviour change , rely mainly upon educational approach criticise `` fail translate knowledge action . '' This may due fact education-based approach specifically address help patient overcome ambivalence behaviour change , necessary ensure daily adherence . Motivational communication ( MC ) client-centred intervention focus enhance intrinsic motivation change particular behaviour ( i.e. , take medication prescribe ) , explore resolve ambivalence behaviour change . Brief MC session ( e.g. , 1-5 x 15-30 minute session ) show improve variety health behaviour ( e.g. , reduce alcohol consumption , improve dietary habit , increase exercise behaviour , improve medication adherence ) health outcome ( reduce blood pressure , body mass index , cholesterol level ) . No study date assess efficacy use MC improve ICS adherence asthmatic . Objective : The purpose study conduct single site RCT ass efficacy use MC improve daily medication ( ICS ) adherence sample poorly control , non-adherent asthmatic . A brief ( 3-5 x 15-30 minute session ) , manualized MC intervention develop laboratory use pilot funding . This intervention empirically-driven us establish behavioural motivational strategy encourage change . Methods : 182 poorly control , non-adherent adult asthmatic recruit outpatient asthma clinic Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montreal ( HSCM ) . Patients screen day asthma clinic visit verify eligibility . Eligible patient consent medical pharmacy record verify research team identify poorly control asthma ( Asthma Control Questionnaire score ≥1.25 ) non-adherent ICS medication ( fill &lt; 50 % ICS medication last year ) invite participate study . Patients undergo baseline assessment ( pulmonary function , asthma control , self-efficacy , quality life ) randomly assign usual care + MC usual care comparison group . This trial design conform CONSORT guideline . The primary outcome measure ICS adherence 12 month post-intervention , preliminary analysis conduct 6-months post-intervention . Adherence measure accord follow validated equation : # treatment day ( base # canister fill pharmacy x duration prescription ) divide # prescription day ( # day patient expect take his/her medication ) . Data obtain access patient 's pharmacy record drug insurance database ( i.e. , RAMQ , reMed ) . Secondary outcome include self-reported medication adherence , adherence motivation , stage change , pulmonary function , asthma control , self-efficacy , quality life score 6 &amp; 12 month post-intervention . Impact : This first appropriately design RCT test impact brief , manualized MC intervention asthma medication ( ICS ) adherence may easily incorporate exist education program and/or clinical practice may significantly improve asthma outcome .</detailed_description>
