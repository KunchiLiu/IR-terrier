	<brief_title>Evaluation TRC105 Treatment Recurrent Ovarian , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Angiogenesis play central role progression epithelial ovarian cancer . In mouse model , VEGF-inhibitors diminish ovarian tumor growth , metastasis malignant ascites formation . Independent Phase 2 trial demonstrate single-agent activity bevacizumab recurrent ovarian cancer , randomize control Phase 3 trial ongoing first-line setting ( GOG 0218 ICON-7 ) recurrent disease ( GOG 0213 , OCEANS ) . TRC105 antibody CD105 , important non-VEGF angiogenic target vascular endothelial cell . TRC105 inhibit angiogenesis , tumor growth metastases preclinical model . In Phase 1 study advance solid tumor , TRC105 therapy cause global reduction angiogenic biomarkers reduce tumor burden dose well-tolerated . We hypothesize TRC105 single-agent activity recurrent ovarian cancer . By target non-VEGF pathway , TRC105 potential complement VEGF inhibitor could represent major advance ovarian cancer therapy .</detailed_description>
