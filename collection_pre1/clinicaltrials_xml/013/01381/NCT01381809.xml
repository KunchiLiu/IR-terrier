	<brief_title>An Efficacy Study Epoetin Alfa Anemic Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( treatment receive assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient know name assign drug ) , placebo-controlled ( comparison patient receive treatment without active ingredient ) , multicenter study epoetin alfa anemic patient diagnose myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) accord protocol-specified criterion . This study include 3-week prerandomization phase , 24-week treatment phase 24-week treatment extension phase . All patient enrol study complete end-of-study visit 4 week last dose study drug ( Week 28 Week 52 ) , 4 week early withdrawal ( unless reason early withdrawal withdrawal consent ) . Between 125 159 patient enrol treatment phase study . During screen phase , take place within 2 week start study drug , study doctor test see patient suitable study . Patients meet entry criterion study randomly assign one 2 treatment group . This mean patient allow join study put group chance , like flip coin . Group 1 patient receive epoetin alfa 450 increased 1050 International Units ( IU ) per kg body weight administer subcutaneous injection ( injection beneath skin ) use pre-filled syrinx . Injections do every week weight-based dose regimen ( total weekly dose receive depend weight ) possible total maximum dose 40,000 IU every week first 8 week treatment phase 80,000 IU every week time study . Group 2 patient receive matching volume placebo administer every week subcutaneous injection . The chance patient get epoetin alfa 2 1 . Doses study drug withheld , decrease , increased basis erythroid response , weekly hemoglobin concentration monitor patient predefined dose adjustment guideline . Patients see study doctor every 4 week period 24 week . At visit patient undergo full hematologic evaluation , serum chemistry evaluation , measurement blood pressure pulse rate , record blood product transfusion transfusion complication , adverse event , concomitant therapy evaluation disease progression . The patient 's Erythroid response assess Week 8 every 4 week thereafter , Week 24 . Blinded study treatment administer patient Week 24 . However , end treatment phase ( Week 24 response assessment ) , responder enter double-blind treatment extension phase measure duration response . Patients continue receive treatment , blind fashion , dose receive Week 24 , return study center every 4 week , Week 48 , assessment Erythroid response evaluation describe . For non-responders Week 24 treatment code broken Week 28 assessment . For responder Week 48 , treatment code broken Week 48 visit , follow completion response assessment . The treatment code broken subject discontinue study treatment Week 24 , irrespective whether responder nonresponders . For subject , blind broken subject complete study database final . Once patient stop receive dos study drug , he/she ask see study doctor safety follow-up visit , schedule 4 week last dose study drug . Safety monitor throughout study predetermine interval clinically indicate physical examination , laboratory test evaluation adverse event . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) periodically review study data assessment disease progression . The total duration study participation 30 54 week .</detailed_description>
