	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass steady-state pharmacokinetics TMC435 participant severe renal impairment compare TMC435 pharmacokinetics match participant normal renal function . We also study short-term safety tolerability TMC435 , administer participant severe renal impairment participant normal renal function . Steady-state term mean drug give long enough plasma concentration remain subsequent dose . TMC435 investigate treatment chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) mean drug absorb bloodstream , distribute body , eliminate body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TMC435 protease inhibitor ( PI ) investigate treatment chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , combination Peg-IFN ( pegylated interferon ) RBV ( ribavirin ) . The result study may provide dose recommendation TMC435 patient severe renal impairement . This Phase I , open-label ( participant investigator know name medication give certain moment ) , investigate effect severe renal impairment pharmacokinetics safety TMC435 . Severe renal impairment define estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) = 29 mL/min/1.73m2 . Participants severe renal impairment allow study dialysis . Normal renal function consider eGFR = 80 mL/min/1.73m2 . eGFR measure filtering capacity kidney . The trial population consist total 16 male female participant . Eight ( 8 ) healthy participant normal renal function 8 participant severe renal impairment include . A healthy participant match participant severe renal impairment regard sex , race , age ( ± 10 year ) , body mass index ( BMI ) ( ± 20 % ) . Dosing match healthy participant start correspond participant severe renal impairment complete Day 10 assessment ( include physical examination ) . All participant receive TMC435150 mg day ( q.d . ) 7 day feed condition . Blood urine sample , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) vital sign ( blood pressure heart rate ) take screening , Day 1 , Day 7 , follow-up visit 1 week last dose study medication follow-up visit 4-5 week last dose study medication . A physical examination perform screening , Day -1 ( = day first medication intake ) , Day 10 follow-up visit . A full pharmacokinetic profile bound TMC435 determine Day 7 72 hour postdose . In addition , unbound TMC435 plasma concentration determine specified timepoints . Safety tolerability monitor throughout trial . Participants admit unit Day-1 discharge Day10 . Each participant receive orally 150 mg TMC435 , q.d . 7 consecutive day .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Nonsmoking smoke 10 cigarette , 2 cigar , 2 pipe per day least 3 month study screen . Body Mass Index 18.0 35.0 kg/m2 Healthy base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , blood test , vital sign , electrocardiogram . Volunteers severe renal impairment must also meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Consistent disease process cause chronic renal failure associate symptom , otherwise judge good health opinion investigator basis medical evaluation ( include physical examination , medical history , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , vital sign , result blood biochemistry , blood coagulation hematology test urinalysis carry screen ) . 2 . Volunteers severe renal impairment estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) = 29 mL/min/1.73m2 , dialysis expect start dialysis next 3 month . 3 . Severity renal disease stable : significant change renal function evidence serum creatinine value within ±25 % last determination , obtain within least 6 month study entry . 4 . Volunteers diabetes mellitus include provided disease control ( i.e. , HbA1c &lt; 7 % ) . 5 . Stable treatment regimen renal impairment 2 month prior treatment start . Diuretics allow need . 6 . Concomitant medication treat underlying disease state medical condition relate renal insufficiency may use , except specifically exclude name pharmacological class , provide dosage stable least 2 month prior treatment start . Matched healthy participant must also meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Judged good health opinion investigator basis medical evaluation reveals absence clinically relevant abnormality include physical examination , medical history , ECG , vital sign , result blood biochemistry , blood coagulation hematology test urinalysis carry screen . 2 . Normal renal function , i.e. , eGFR = 80 mL/min/1.73m2 . 3 . Matched participant severe renal impairment regard sex , race , age ( ± 10 year ) BMI ( ± 20 % ) . Infection hepatitis A , B C virus Infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) History current medical condition could impact safety participant study Having previously dose TMC435 multipledose trial TMC435 Having previously dose TMC435 3 singledose trial TMC435 . Participants severe renal impairment must also follow characteristic : 1 . History renal transplant renal carcinoma . Participants history renal carcinoma cancer free least 5 year may include . 2 . Uncontrolled hypertension . 3 . Hepatorenal syndrome . 4 . Imminent renal replacement therapy ( i.e. , trial period ) . Matched healthy subject must also follow characteristic : History congenital hereditary kidney disease ( include polycystic kidney disease ) , nephrectomy , renal transplant nephrolitiasis .</criteria>
