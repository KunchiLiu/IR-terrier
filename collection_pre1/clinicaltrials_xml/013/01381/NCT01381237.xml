	<brief_summary>Due many problem associate reduced balance mobility , provide effective engage rehabilitation regimen essential progress recovery impairment help prevent degradation motor skill . The purpose examine effect physical therapy base task-oriented approach deliver engaging , interactive video game paradigm . The intervention focus perform target dynamic task , include reactive balance control environmental interaction . Thirty community dwell ambulatory old adult attend Day hospital balance mobility limitation treatment participate study . Participants randomly assign either control group experimental group . The control group receive typical rehabilitation program provide Day Hospital , consist strengthen balance exercise . The experimental group receive program dynamic balance exercise couple video game play , use centre pressure ( COP ) position signal computer mouse . The task perform stand fix floor surface progression compliant sponge pad . Each group receive 16 session , schedule two per week , last 45 minute . Balance performance measure spatial-temporal gait variable obtain pre- post-treatment Findings demonstrate significant improvement group balance performance score post-treatment , change score significantly great experimental compare control group . No significant treatment effect observe either group spatial-temporal gait variable . In conclusion dynamic balance exercise fix compliant sponge surface feasibly couple interactive game-based exercise . This turn result great improvement dynamic stand balance control compare typical exercise program . However transfer effect gait function .
