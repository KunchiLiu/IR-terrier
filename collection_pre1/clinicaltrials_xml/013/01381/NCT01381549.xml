	<criteria>Adult subject least 18 year age . N.B . Females nonchildbearing childbearing potential may enrol . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test study entry must practice adequate contraception least 30 day prior study entry . Additionally , subject agree one follow method avoidance pregnancy entire study treatment period : Abstinence ; , Oral Contraceptive , either combine estrogen/progesterone progesterone alone , PLUS additional barrier method [ ie , condom , occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) vaginal spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) ] ; , Injectable progesterone ; Implants levonorgestrel ; , Estrogenic vaginal ring ; , Percutaneous contraceptive patch ; Intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) show failure rate le 1 % IUD IUS product label ; , Has male partner sterilize ( vasectomy documentation azoospermia ) . Double barrier method : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) vaginal spermicidal agent ( foam/gel/film/cream/suppository ) Females consider nonchildbearing potential document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal , define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 147 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] Subject require hospitalisation clinical sign symptom low cUTI pyelonephritis ( complicate uncomplicated ) define , require parenteral treatment treatment course minimum 5 day maximum 14 day : Lower cUTI subject must document fever define &gt; 38°C oral , &gt; 38.5°C tympanic &gt; 39°C rectal , within last 24 hour exception would : Afebrile subject low cUTI white blood cell count ( WBC ) ≥15,000 cells/mm3 Afebrile subject low cUTI follow require parenteral therapy due specific indication e.g . operative procedure , oral antibiotic indicate case cUTI suspect due pathogen resistant current oral antibiotic least two follow UTI symptom include dysuria , frequency , urgency suprapubic pain , presence complicate factor : Male gender ; Current bladder instrumentation indwell urinary catheter remove two day end IV study drug administration ; Obstructive uropathy expect medically surgically treated course IV study drug administration ; Urogenital surgery within 7 day precede administration first dose study drug ; Functional anatomical abnormality urogenital tract include anatomic malformation neurogenic bladder void disturbance least 100 mL residual urine . Acute pyelonephritis ( complicate uncomplicated ) : subject must document fever define &gt; 38°C oral , &gt; 38.5°C tympanic &gt; 39°C rectal , within last 24 hour flank pain costovertebral angle tenderness ( CVA ) . Complicating factor pyelonephritis complicate UTI . Subject pyuria ( white blood cell [ WBC ] count &gt; 10/µL ( &gt; 5/highpower field [ HPF ] conventional urinalysis ) unspun cleancatch midstream urine ( MSU ) catheter urine sample &gt; = 10 WBC/HPF spun MSU catheter urine ) . Subject Gramnegative organism ( ) direct examination Gramstained specimen unspun spun MSU catheter urine sample . Subject provide pretherapy urine specimen obtain within 48 hour prior start therapy , culture grow least one two Gramnegative uropathogens &gt; =10^5 CFU/mL . A subject may enrol result pretherapy urine culture know , subject withdrawn study culture yield least one two qualify Gramnegative uropathogens &gt; =10^5 CFU/mL culture yield Grampositive uropathogens . A subject low cUTI pyelonephritis ( complicate uncomplicated ) fail previous antibacterial treatment regimen eligible provided urine specimen positive one two bacterial Gramnegative uropathogens &gt; =10^5 CFU/mL . Subjects treatment failure due imipenemcilastatin enrol . QTcB QTcF &lt; 450 msec ; QTc &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block Subjects meeting follow criterion must enrol study : Concomitant infection require systemic antibacterial therapy study drug time randomisation . Subject know one following : A urinary catheter remove study ( expectation catheter would insert therapy study drug subsequently remove study period ; ( intermittent straight catheterisation acceptable ) Complete permanent obstruction urinary tract ; A permanent indwelling catheter comparable instrumentation include nephrostomy remove IV study drug administration Suspected confirm prostatitis Suspected confirm perinephric intrarenal abscess A UTI suspect confirmed fungal origin ( &gt; = 10^3 fungal CFU/mL ) A UTI suspect confirm due Grampositive uropathogen ( ) , &gt; = 10^5 Grampositive organism CFU/mL ; A UTI know study entry cause pathogen ( ) resistant study antimicrobial agent ; Known ileal loop vesicoureteral reflux ; Polycystic kidney disease . Subject APACHE II score &gt; 20 Subject know severe impairment renal function include : calculated creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) less 50 mL/min ; requirement peritoneal dialysis , haemodialysis , haemofiltration ; oliguria ( less 20 mL urine output per hour 24 hour ) ; Subject intractable low cUTI require 14 Days IV treatment . Subjects asymptomatic low cUTI , subject spinal cord injury lower cUTI able perceive symptom due injury . Subject low cUTI pyelonephritis ( complicate uncomplicated ) receive amount potentially therapeutic antibiotic within 96 h provide baseline urine culture specimen prior start study . Subject Grampositive organism ( ) direct examination Gramstained specimen spun/unspun MSU catheter urine . Subject consider unlikely survive 4 6 week study period rapidly progress disease immediately lifethreatening illness ( include acute hepatic failure , respiratory failure septic shock ) . Subject evidence know preexist severe hepatic disease ( ChildPugh score B C ) . Subject know baseline haemoglobin le 10 g/dL , haematocrit le 30 % and/or know reticulocyte count &gt; 5 % ( i.e. , reticulocytes &gt; 5 % total RBC mass ) Subject know neutropenia anticipate develop neutropenia course study ( i.e. , new chemotherapy subject ) , absolute neutrophil count less 1000 cells/mm3 Subject know platelet count le 75,000 cell /mm3 ( subject platelet count low 50,000 cell /mm3 eligible reduction historically stable ) . Subject immunocompromising illness ; include know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , organ ( include bone marrow ) transplantation , hematological malignancy , and/or immunosuppressive therapy , include highdose corticosteroid ( e.g. , great 40 mg prednisone equivalent per day great two week ) Subject participate investigational drug device study within 30 day study entry within 5 halflives , whichever longer . Subject previously receive treatment GSK2251052 . Subject prior history seizure CNS abnormality predispose seizure lower seizure threshold and/or use concomitant medication seizure potential .
