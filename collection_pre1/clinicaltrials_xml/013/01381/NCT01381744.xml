	<brief_summary>Plague infectious disease animal human cause bacteria , Yersinia pestis . Modern antibiotic effective plague , infect person treat promptly disease likely cause illness death . The purpose study evaluate safety , immunogenicity ( bodily defense reaction ) , tolerability new research vaccine . Up 48 people enrol study Center Vaccine Development Saint Louis University . Four group 12 volunteer give vaccine placebo ( inactive substance ) one group time start low dose work high dose . Shots give arm 2 time separate 28 day . Study procedures include : physical exam , blood sample , record temperature side effect memory aid . Participants involve study related procedure 13 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose Escalation Trial Plague Vaccine , Flagellin/F1/V , Healthy Adult Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yersinia ( Y . ) pestis , gram-negative coccobacillus , cause acute often fatal disease may appear 1 several major manifestation : bubonic , septicemic , pneumonic . Transmission human commonly occur via bite infectious flea associate regional lymphadenopathy bubo . Pneumonic plague would likely outcome case bio-terrorism attack . Currently , effective license vaccine protects pneumonic plague . The investigational product , flagellin/F1/V phosphate-buffered saline , pH 6.2 , vaccine design provide protection respiratory exposure Y. pestis , i.e. , pneumonic plague . The general hypothesis test flagellin/F1/V vaccine induce robust humoral immune response F1 V antigens Y. pestis without serious adverse event ( SAEs ) vaccine give intramuscularly ( IM ) 2 occasion separate 28 day dose 1 , 3 , 6 10 microgram ( mcg ) . Since major rationale vaccine protection respiratory exposure Y. pestis follow bio-terrorism attack , initial study population 18-45 year old healthy volunteer . The primary objective study assess safety immunogenicity escalate dosage Flagellin/F1/V vaccine among healthy subject give 2 dos vaccine IM route Days 0 28 . The secondary objective study evaluate reactogenicity cell mediate immune response escalate dosage Flagellin/F1/V vaccine among healthy subject give 2 dos vaccine IM route Days 0 28 . Participants include 48 healthy male female volunteer . This study design randomize , placebo control , double-blind ( within dose group ) , dose escalation Phase I study . The study consist 4 group dose sequentially . Each group consist 10 individual receive vaccine 2 receive placebo . Each subject receive IM vaccination Days 0 28 . The initial dose evaluate 1 mcg/dose . Following assessment safety reactogenicity data group Safety Monitoring Committee vaccine dos increase sequentially 1 , 3 , 6 , 10 mcg/dose . Following vaccination , subject return clinical site Days 1 , 14 , 28 follow initial vaccination Days 1 , 14 , 28 , 40 , 180 follow second vaccination . In addition , subject contact phone Day 3 vaccination review memory aid , query adverse event ( AEs ) /SAEs concomitant medication . All subject complete subject memory aid 15 day follow vaccination ( Day 0-14 ) . Unsolicited , non-serious AEs collect Day 56 ( Visit 8 , 26-30 day follow final vaccination ) . SAEs collect throughout study period Day 393 ( Visit 11 , 365 day + 14 day second vaccination ) . Blood sample safety lab collect screening , day initial vaccination 14 day vaccination . Specimens collect immunologic assay note clinic visit , well 6 month post final vaccination .</detailed_description>
