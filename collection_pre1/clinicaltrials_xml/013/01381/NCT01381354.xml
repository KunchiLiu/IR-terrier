	<detailed_description>Restoration function rare individual MS experience gradual worsening absence acute MS symptom ( relapse ) partial complete recovery acute symptom ( remission ) . A recent case report patient secondary progressive MS document transition scooter dependence mild gait disability follow initiation electrotherapy form neuromuscular electrical stimulation nutritional intervention aim increase nutrient density decrease risk food sensitivity food allergy . Multiple study neuromuscular electrical stimulation athlete , cerebral palsy stroke patient demonstrate gain strength coordination . Multiple author report antioxidant , essential amino acid micronutrient rich diet neuroprotective . It likely combination intensive nutrition electrotherapy contribute marked gain improvement . However absence additional case report strength association remain unknown . The intent study replicate intervention case report closely possible . Our primary objective measure many completely subject implement 1 ) nutritional intervention , 2 ) home exercise program intervention , 3 ) electrotherapy intervention improve improve nutrition exercise associate improved function . To assess improvement function measure 1 ) change nutritional status report food frequency survey , 24 hr dietary recall , 2 ) change neurocognitive testing behavior , 3 ) change self-reported function disability scale , 4 ) change gait 5 ) change medication dose class MS relate symptom . Subjects follow three year . After first year , subject receive intensive support study team . The subject return month 18 , 24 36 ass adherence study intervention , function quality life . Nutrition intake assess 24 36 month . To assess safety ass safety lab ( kidney liver function test ) change weight , self report side effect questionnaire .</detailed_description>
