	<detailed_description>Exacerbations common feature moderate-to-severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Morbidity , mortality health-care cost patient largely result exacerbation . The common cause exacerbation infection tracheobronchial tree . Among , Streptococcus pneumoniae frequently isolated organism , account 5-25 % patient COPD , also commonly identify cause community-acquired pneumonia ( CAP ) , account 16.5-38.9 % CAP patient . In recent year , widespread emergence antimicrobial resistance Streptococcus pneumoniae become major global concern , especially Taiwan , one high level antibiotic-resistant pneumococci world . Therefore , primary prevention vaccination encourage high-risk patient COPD . The currently available adult pneumococcal vaccine consist capsular polysaccharide 23 different serotypes Streptococcus pneumoniae ( PPSV23 ) . The antibody produce response polysaccharide provide protection induce host immune cell kill opsonize bacteria phagocytosis . Until , study design specifically examine vaccine efficacy COPD patient . Among 3 available randomize controlled trial , one study involve 596 patient find , post-hoc analysis , protective efficacy pneumonia patient &lt; 65 year age FEV1 &lt; 40 % predict . Based evidence ( limited body data ) , Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) 2006 Guideline recommend PPSV23 inoculation evidence B . By way , comparison placebo single component , superior control mean inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) /long-acting beta2-agonist ( LABA ) fix combination therapy demonstrate significant clinical improvement moderate-to-severe COPD patient , except mortality , meta-analysis large prospective study ( TORCH [ Towards Revolution COPD Health ] trial INSPIRE [ Investigating New Standards Prophylaxis Reduction Exacerbations ] trial ) . However , database indicate high daily dose ICS ( fluticasone propionate dose 500-1000mcg daily ) associate excess risk pneumonia , double pneumonia incidence patient receive ICS . The immunogenicity PPSV23 COPD patient use systemic steroid demonstrate clinical efficacy vaccination investigate . From above-mentioned background , use PPSV23 reduce incidence pneumonia exacerbation COPD patient use high daily dose ICS , benefit ICS preserve risk pneumonia reduce . For primary physician , hypothesis , true , beneficial . So , study , investigator want conduct double-blinded , randomize control trial evaluate clinical efficacy PPSV23 COPD patient use high daily dose ICS .</detailed_description>
