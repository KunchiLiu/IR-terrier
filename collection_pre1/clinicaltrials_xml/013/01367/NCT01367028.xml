	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Neoadjuvant Trastuzumab+Docetaxel+NPLD+/-Bevacizumab Her2-pos . Early Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The target study population consist male female pre- postmenopausal patient HER2-positive , adenocarcinoma breast ( except inflammatory breast cancer , T4d ) schedule receive neoadjuvant cytotoxic treatment . Patients must pathologically confirm breast cancer histologically confirm HER2 over-expression . At screening , patient must adequate leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ; ECOG performance status 0 1 ; adequate liver , renal bone marrow function ; free serious disease could affect protocol compliance interpretation result . Patients increase risk GI perforation , hypertension , proteinuria , wound heal complication , thromboembolism hemorrhage . Patients must another primary malignancy could affect compliance protocol interpretation result . Patients central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases exclude . Pregnant lactating female exclude . Patients hypertension ( &gt; 150 mmHG systolic &gt; 100 mmHG diastolic ) patient history GI perforation , abdominal fistula intra-abdominal abscess within 6 month study entry exclude . Full anticoagulation therapy study entry allow long patient stable level anticoagulant least 2 week time study treatment start .</detailed_description>
