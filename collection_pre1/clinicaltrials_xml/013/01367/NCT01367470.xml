	<detailed_description>Effects cytokine , sphingomyelinase PAF hydrolysis capacity maternal milk term newborns maternal probiotic administration last four week gestation and/or first month lactation . The newborn immune system influence maternal immunity placenta breastfeeding . There exist close interaction mother baby gestation lactation . Maternal milk contain number factor protect newborn infection include 1 ) cytokine receptor also think play role ( albeit still partially controversial ) protection allergy ; 2 ) oligosaccharide low molecular weight 3 ) probiotic bacteria contribute development newborn immune system . Probiotics potent immunogenic activity well immunoprotective potential maternal milk administration probiotic pregnancy breastfeed . In addition probiotic suppose play role increase production sphingomyelinase , enzymes . Aim study Assessment breast milk woman deliver healthy term baby , well parameter include immunomodulatory effect , sphingomyelinase concentration PAF hydrolysis capacity administration probiotic VSL # 3 ( VSL Pharmaceuticals ) mother last four week gestation first month breastfeeding . Controlled Blind Prospective Study . Group 1 ( maternal milk/ case ) : 30 mother last four week gestation first month breastfeeding . All mother give ( obtain inform consent ) probiotic ( VSL # 3 ) last four week pregnancy first month breastfeed usual dosage scheme ( 1 sachet/day , meal ) ; Group 2 ( maternal milk/controls ) : 30 mother last week gestation first month breastfeeding . These mother give probiotic question . Groups 1 2 undergo assessment concentration immunoglobulin ( secretory IgA ) , TGF-beta , IL 10 e IL 6 , well assessment sphingomyelinase PAF hydrolysis capacity colostrum ( 3-4 day lactation ) , transition milk ( 1st week lactation ) , mature milk ( 1st week lactation ) end first month lactation . The sample analyze probiotic microorganism . Furthermore , parallel , metabolic profile 1HNMR spectroscopy perform sample colostrum , transition mature milk . The cytokine , immunoglobulin , sphingomyelinase PAF hydrolysis capacity microbiota assess faeces newborns day . The data subject enrol study collect Data Sheet also include assessment mother 's risk allergy . A Data Sheet also envisage newborn enrol study also include daily assessment gastric stagnation , vomit episode abdominal distension .</detailed_description>
