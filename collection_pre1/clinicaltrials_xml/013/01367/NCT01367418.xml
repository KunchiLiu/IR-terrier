	<brief_summary>Several recently publish retrospective study show regional anaesthesia ( RA ) reduce cancer-related mortality follow surgical treatment colorectal , breast prostate cancer malignant melanoma . If result true , choice perioperative pain management beneficial , even well , current oncological therapy . This theory need investigated prospective , randomize control trail . We shall perform prospective , randomize study compare effect Thoracic epidural analgesia ( TEA ) patient control analgesia ( PCA ) postoperative immunological inflammatory marker order understand whether protective effect , , regional analgesia due change marker whether underlie mechanism mediate via stress signal pathway .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Anesthetic Technique Immune Inflammatory Systems Following Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods Thirty patient ( ASA status 1-2 ) age group 50 - 75 year , undergo elective radical retropubic prostatectomy would include pilot study . The exact type cancer , stag , degree spread proximal distant sit pathologic type cancer would record . Patients chronic analgesic medication , endocrinologic immunologic disease , know allergy LA epidural catheter placement contraindicate would exclude . Patients would allocate one three group : General anesthesia combine Epidural anesthesia operation ( Group GE ; n = 12 ) , General anesthesia combine Epidural anesthesia local anesthesia postoperatively ( Group GL ; n = 12 ) , General anesthesia alone ( Group GO ; n = 10 ) Anesthesia Surgery All patient would premedicated midazolam 0.1 mg/kg 15-30 min plan surgery , routine hospital . Paracetamol 1 g give orally every 6 h start first dose time premedication . IV access would attain preoperative hold area anxiolytic would give necessary intravenously . Epidural technique In patient Group GE , 18 G epidural needle would insert Th10-12 inter-space use 'hanging-drop ' loss resistance technique patient sit position hold area . The epidural catheter would insert subsequently test subarachnoid intravascular placement use 3 ml mepivacaine 2 % adrenaline , standard practice hospital . A bolus dose 3-4 ml mepivacaine 2 % adrenaline would subsequently inject loss sensation cold determine 10 min . If sensory block upper level Thoracic 8 dermatome minimal low level L2 achieve , patient would consider ready induction anesthesia . If , dose 2-3 ml mepivacaine 2 % adrenaline would inject epidurally . If fails achieve desire block , would assume catheter incorrectly place patient offer choice one attempt epidural catheter placement , exclusion study . Patients Group GO would epidural catheter place . Following transfer operate room routine monitoring , anesthesia would induce patient fentanyl 2 mg/kg i.v . propofol 1-2mg/kg loss eyelash reflex . Tracheal intubation would perform muscle relaxation rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg anesthesia maintain 1-3 % sevoflurane 33 % oxygen air . Mechanical ventilation would use low-flow system order maintain end-tidal CO2 4.5-5.5 kPa . In patient , sevoflurane concentration would adjust order maintain adequate anesthetic depth , would measure use Auditory evoked potential ( AEP ) maintain 15-25 ( A-line ) . Tachycardia , despite adequate anesthetic depth , would treat give fentanyl intermittently IV analgesic require operation . At end surgery , muscle relaxation would reverse use glycopyrrolate ( 0.2 mg ) neostigmine ( 2.5 mg ) . Radical retropubic prostatectomy would perform standardized way use lower-abdominal midline incision . Postoperative Management During first 4 h postoperatively , patient Group GO would receive morphine 1-2 mg IV intermittently pain relief post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) order numeric rating scale ( NRS ) ( 0 = pain , 10 = worst imaginable pain ) &lt; 3 . Patients Group GE would infusion ropivacaine 0.2 % 5-10 ml/h epidurally . In event pain , morphine ( 1-2 mg ) would administer intravenously need group order provide good pain relief NRS &lt; 3 . All patient would observe PACU 4 h transfer general urological ward . The epidural infusion/PCA pump would continue long pain relief need use technique minimum 48 h. Subsequently , pain relief would obtain use oral analgesic use combination paracetamol NSAID drug . Recording Measurements The total amount anesthetic analgesic drug require operation would record . Anesthetic drug requirement would determine two method : end-tidal concentration sevoflurane record every 5 min weight vaporizer anesthetic . For measurement , time anesthetic gas turn consider time zero ( = 0 ) . In addition routine postoperative protocol , follow measurement record : Pain intensity : At site incision , 'deep ' ( visceral ) pain pain cough 1 , 4 , 12 , 24 48 h measure use NRS . Rescue analgesic ( morphine ) consumption : 0-4 h , 4-24 h 24-48 h. Supplementary analgesic consumption : Additional analgesic administer order relieve pain would recorded/day . Side effect : Nausea and/or vomit ( 0-4 h , 4-24 h 24-48 h ) , pruritus complication record . Surgical complication : surgical incision would inspect daily evidence infection grade either evidence infection ( = 0 ) , evidence inflammation ( = 1 ) , mild wind dehiscence suspect infection ( = 2 ) pu formation definite infection ( = 3 ) . After 48-72 h , epidural catheter would remove catheter tip send bacterial culture . Blood sampling : Patient serum EDTA/Heparin plasma assess cytokine level Luminex multiplex assay ( Human Inflammation 12-Plex kit ; GM.CSF , IFN-g , IL-1b , IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-12 , TNF-a VEGF R &amp; D system ) PGE2 level measure ELISA kit Cayman Chemicals Company . In addition , marker systemic inflammatory response , include CRP , white blood cell count , differential count total platelet count , also measure surgery . Natural Killer ( NK ) cell activity blood would measure use FANKIA assay . Clusters differentiation ( CD ) marker would measure . Stress response would measure use serum cortisol prolactin level .</detailed_description>
