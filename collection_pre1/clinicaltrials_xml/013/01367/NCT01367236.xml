	<detailed_description>Impairment neurocognitive ( NC ) function HIV-infected subject current anti-retroviraltreatment ( cART ) era associate poor compliance cART , reduce quality-of-life increased mortality . Reported factor associate development NC function impairment HIV disease risk associate progression impairment include degree immune suppression relate HIV infection , chronic viral infection ( chronic hepatitis C co-infection ) , age central nervous system ( CNS ) antiretroviral drug exposure . One modifiable factor may associate evolution NC function impairment direct effect cART central-nervous-system ( CNS ) . Certain antiretroviral drug zidovudine , lamivudine , abacavir , nevirapine , efavirenz indinavir know achieve optimal exposure cerebro-spinal-fluid ( CSF ) whereas drug , majority HIV-1 protease inhibitor penetrate less effectively . Studies date suggest different cART regimen may differ effect NC performance . In EuroSIDA study , use nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase inhibitor find specifically protect development HIV relate brain disease . More recently , small prospective study , ALTAIR , different effect cerebral function report subject randomise commence three different cART regimen . The investigator propose , prospective , randomise study assess effect two different antiretroviral regimen NC function HIV infect subject commence antiretroviral therapy first time .</detailed_description>
