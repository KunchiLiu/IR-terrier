	<brief_title>Effect Growth Hormone Early Brain Development Girls With Turner Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies older child adult find IQ ( intelligence quotient ) individual Turner syndrome ( TS ) general population similar . However , many individual TS nonverbal learn disability may cause problem imagine work object space ( example : building block , work puzzle , copy design , drive car ) well problem plan , pay attention , get along people age . Studies brain structure find change size function specific area brain involve nonverbal process . However , data publish brain structure function girl Turner Syndrome first year life brain learn grow rapidly . In recent study , young , short girl Turner Syndrome ( TS ) ( average 2 year age ) treat Growth Hormone ( GH ) almost reach average height 2 year . The risk GH young girl study appear old girl . Therefore , recommend GH therapy consider soon child TS growth failure . Growth failure often occur infancy ; therefore , child TS receive GH therapy young 12 month age . In study , investigator wish start understand effect GH learn brain growth give age 12 24 month . In study , girl TS developmental study , physical examination , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , blood draw one two year age . Some girl study receive GH 12 24 month life , others . Brain growth development compare treated GH . This pilot study investigator gather data design large study answer question .</detailed_description>
