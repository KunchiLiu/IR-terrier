	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate effect femur expose vibration rest muscle electrical activity hip adductor case postmenopausal osteoporosis . Among patient admit investigator clinic out-patients whose bone densitometric measurement make prediagnosis postmenopausal osteoporosis , total 80 voluntary [ 40 postmenopausal osteoporosis ( femur neck total hip T score &lt; -2.0 ) 40 Controls ( Hip lumbar bone mineral density normal ) ] plan include study . After left hip bone mineral density ( BMD ) BMC measure case , whole body vibration apply PMO group Controls . The rest muscle electrical activity leave hip muscle evaluate pre-treatment , post-treatment , treatment patient PMO data compare Controls data . Plasma sclerostin level measure 10th minute vibration . Cases stand vibration plate . WBV apply frequency 40 Hz amplitude 2 mm 30 + 30 second . WBV apply one session . The left hip BMD BMC evaluate bone densitometer ( Norland ) . The rest muscle electrical activity hip adductor muscle rest measure PowerLab ( data acquisition system , ADInstruments , Australia ) device . This project plan complete 3 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It usually report parallelism change bone structure function muscle structure function . Sarcopenia frequently observe osteoporotic patient . Bone formation increase bone resorption decrease exercise . One important function bone bear mechanical load include body weight . Bone must strong enough resist mechanical loading . Mechanisms need protect bone bone subject excessive mechanical loading . These mechanism may mainly focus strengthen bone and/or change vectorial property mechanical load applied bone . The vectorial property mechanical load applied bone may control muscle contraction . Bone contain wide mechanoreceptor net construct osteocyte . So , distribution mechanical load bone cross-sectional area possible perceive . It may also possible inappropriate distribution mechanical load bone crosssectional area optimize muscle contraction . To get regulation , mechanism muscle activity control central nervous system base mechanical load distribution bone cross-sectional area . The investigator previously show bone regulate muscle activity , base bone mineral density . According study result , suggest may exist mechanism bone sense mechanical stimulus send signal central nervous system neuronally regulate muscle activity ( bone myo-regulation reflex ) . ( It also well know load-induced adaptive bone formation neuronally regulate . Taken together , general mechanism , bone reflex , may define bone subject load neuronally regulate bone formation muscle activity ) Vibration strong osteogenic effect . Vibration-induced bone formation neuronally regulate . Vibration also effectively enhance muscle strength power . Previous study show vibration increase muscle electromyographic ( EMG ) activity . It show bone effect increase muscle EMG activity cause vibration healthy young adult study . In study , report vibrations-induced increase muscle electrical activity flexor carpus radialis ( FCR ) relate ultradistal radius bone mineral content ( BMC ) FCR H-reflex suppress depressed vibration . This finding report support assumption bone expose cyclic mechanical loading may neuronally regulate muscle activity . The aim study investigate effect femur expose vibration rest muscle electrical activity hip adductor case postmenopausal osteoporosis .</detailed_description>
