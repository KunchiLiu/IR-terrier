	<brief_summary>Patients obstructive jaundice ( OJ ) often require surgical , endoscopic radiological intervention facilitate biliary drainage relieve jaundice . However known patient OJ increased surgical risk non-jaundiced patient undergoing procedure . Surgery severe OJ associate significant post-operative mortality ( 10-15 % ) morbidity ( 30-65 % ) . The common complication related sepsis pathophysiological mechanism behind susceptibility bacterial infection clear . Recent work show pivotal role bile maintenance enterocyte tight junction expression tight junction-associated protein could account translocation enteric bacteria bacterial product mesenteric lymph node complex , portal circulation subsequently liver . Some bacterial product , endotoxin quorum sense signal molecule ( QSSMs ) , immunomodulatory property may dampen normal immune response infection result life-threatening organ dysfunction . Bacterial endotoxin quorum sense signal molecule ( QSSMs ) represent good candidate mediator immune suppression although compel case involvement pathogenesis sepsis , evidence support involvement aetiology infection OJ currently lack .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive jaundice ( OJ ) condition blockage flow bile liver lead accumulation bile product blood result yellow itch skin . Common cause OJ include gallstone also tumours pancreas bile duct . Relieving type jaundice treat underlying cause include endoscopic surgical procedure . It known however , patient OJ increased surgical risk non-jaundiced patient undergo operation . Studies show surgery severe OJ associate postoperative mortality region 10-15 % morbidity rate 30-65 % . Complications related bacterial infection common patient develop severe infection may require treatment broad spectrum antibiotic care intensive high dependency unit . Although antibiotic prove invaluable treat postoperative infection carry potential adverse effect . Antibiotics suppress normal gut bacteria allow disease cause bacteria proliferate , Clostridium difficile . This usually manifest mild-to-moderate diarrhoea occasionally cause life-threatening bowel inflammation . The widespread use antibiotic also central development bacterial strain antibiotic resistance . This clinical problem also economic , political environmental implication National Health Service . Adherence measure infection control , education antibiotic policy minimise antibiotic resistance ; however limit surround approach lead demand novel alternative strategy . It recently discover bacteria able communicate produce specialised molecule know quorum sense signal molecule ( QSSMs ) . An accumulation QSSMs surround environment allow bacteria quantify size colony . At specific colony size concentration QSSMs reach critical threshold lead activation gene cause infection . Disruption quorum sense show reduce severity infection animal study lead development inhibitor quorum sense possible strategy antibacterial therapy . Previous work conduct University Nottingham demonstrate QSSMs also influence number function specific type immune cell know 'antigen present cell ' . These cell pivotal allow immune system recognise component bacteria foreign thereby mount appropriate response . It find large number type cell underwent program cell death ( cell suicide ) presence QSSMs compare QSSMs absent . This mirror situation blood sample patient severe infection great proportion cell death among antigen present cell type immune cell . It likely susceptibility infectious complication patient obstructive jaundice due interplay various factor . The absence intestinal bile implication integrity bowel wall barrier , change gut microflora flora translocation bacteria product . In addition , clear form immune dysfunction occur , dampen normal response follow exposure bacterial product . This immune dysfunction may avert powerful inflammatory cascade result life-threatening multi organ dysfunction expense condition favour bacterial survival . QSSMs represent good candidate mediator immune dysfunction although compel case involvement pathogenesis sepsis , definitive evidence support role infective process OJ currently lack .</detailed_description>
