	<detailed_description>It know 33-50 % Classic Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome patient eventually develop dysautonomia , otherwise know `` POTS '' - Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome . Some patient develop dysautonomia result retroflex odontoid , Chiari 1 Malformation cranial settle result basilar impression . However , many Ehlers-Danlos patient suffer symptomology evidence cause accord MRI imaging . It author 's hypothesis low-level External Communicating Hydrocephalus appear responsible constellation autonomic cranial nerve symptom , present young , analysis head circumference growth first 15 month life reflect abnormally rapid head growth , support hypothesis . The investigator evaluate head circumference Ehlers-Danlos patient display dysautonomia later life . The head circumference analyze birth approximately 15 month age , suture skull generally fuse 16 18 month . Additionally , pediatrician usually measure head circumference routinely beyond age . In small subset Ehlers-Danlos patient develop postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome childhood teen year , retrospective analysis head circumference indicate megalocephaly . On average , child 's head find increase approximately 35th percentile 90th percentile . Their weight length increase fashion , although child remain high percentage length . A review literature indicate study child megalocephaly ( necessarily diagnosis Ehlers-Danlos ) consider benign condition ( `` Benign External Communicating Hydrocephalus '' ) CT 's age 2 3 year appear normal neurological exam also appear normal . However , study also show large percentage child exhibit delayed motor development delay speech development.In study child treat Diamox , study child merely observe . It author 's hypothesis delay motor development find Ehlers-Danlos child due least part hydrocephalus , merely due flexible joint , previously surmise . It author 's contention mild symptom irritability , headache , sleep disorder , emotional `` fit '' , later development dysautonomia never consider study , yet likely symptom low level pressure continue exerted brain child . High pressure brain ( even subtle ) could evidence congenital CCSVI ( cerebrospinal venous insufficiency ) increase CSF ( cerebral spinal fluid ) production , poor drainage cerebral spinal fluid , . Retrospective examination skull expansion necessary step ascertain possibility , allow early treatment hope avoidance neurological symptom , often disable effect dysautonomia ( and/or multiple sclerosis ) . It author 's contention `` Benign External Hydrocephalus '' benign condition .</detailed_description>
