	<detailed_description>Lung cancer rank among commonly occur malignancy currently lead cause cancer-related cause worldwide include Taiwan [ 1 , 2 ] . Although lot research focus treatment lung cancer , prognosis lung cancer remain dismal five year survival ate le 15 % [ 3 ] . Unfortunately , early detection lung cancer still problem . In tertiary care hospital Taiwan , 27.3 % patient could receive operation ( stage I 15 % , stage II 7.5 % ) [ 4 ] . Lymph node stag also important evaluation possibility operation . Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ( FDP-PET ) use oncologist evaluate lung mass , solitary pulmonary nodule intrathoracic lymph node . As technique become widespread , use even first line image investigation . Although PET high negative predictive value , neither sensitive specific differentiate benign malignant mediastinal lymph node [ 5 , 6 ] . If PET positive mediastinal lymph node equal malignant involvement , patient might exclude potentially curative surgery . Several national guideline group suggest PET positive lymph node biopsied likely result alter clinical management [ 7 , 8 ] . `` Cervical mediastinoscopy '' regard `` standard procedure '' sample mediastinal lymph node . However , technique require general anesthesia could repeat adhesion . Access hilar nodal station difficult mediastinoscopy . In recent year , one minimally invasive method endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA ) use biopsy hilar mediastinal lymph node [ 9 ] . EBUS-TBNA allow mediastinal lymph node target area accessible cervical mediastinoscopy , well hilar node ( lymph node station 2-4 , 7 , 10-12 ) [ 9 ] . Kazuhiro Yasufuku publish first report real-time EBUS-TBNA evaluate mediastinal lymphadenopathy 2004 [ 10 ] . Currently , main indication EBUS-TBNA mediastinal nodal stag NSCLC recent meta-analyses establish comparable sensitivity specificity nodal stag EBUS-TBNA cervical mediastinoscopy [ 11 ] . Efficacy evaluation disease process sarcoidosis lymphoma also establish [ 12 ] . Although several large study compare diagnostic efficacy mediastinal malignant lymphadenopathy FDG-PET EBUS-TBNA , investigator need data high incidence TB lymphadenitis Taiwan , diagnostic accuracy PET may lower country .</detailed_description>
