	<brief_summary>Specific aim : Identification characterization cancer stem cell-like population ( cancer stem cell cancer initiate cell ) primary tumor tissue , primary ascites peripheral blood ovarian cancer patient genetically engineer mouse ovarian cancer cell line . Objectives : In future , individualized therapy must incorporate analysis cancer stem cell cancer initiate cell ovarian cancer cell design therapeutic strategy ovarian cancer patient . Aims project : 1 . Isolation identification cancer stem cell-like population ( cancer stem cell cancer initiate cell ) primary tumor tissue , primary ascites peripheral blood ovarian cancer patient 2 . In vivo tumorigenicity assay perform measure tumor formation cancer stem cell-like population equal number inject dorsal fat pad nude mouse . 3 . To establish standard protocol stem cell-like population maintenance 4 . Screening potential specific biomarkers involve ovarian cancer stem cell-like population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer high mortality gynecological cancer , overall 5-year survival rate 30-40 % . The incidence ovarian cancer also increase recent year Taiwan , become important issue . The lack symptom , difficulty early diagnosis , insufficient accurate tumor marker , lack information ovarian tumor biology contribute poor prognosis ovarian cancer patient . The prognostic factor ovarian carcinoma include tumor stage , subtype histology , grade differentiation , residual tumor debulking surgery , response chemotherapy . Especially resistance chemotherapy play great role prognosis patient . However , current study present incomplete picture tumor biology ovarian cancer . It quite helpful clinical management investigator examine possible underlying mechanism tumorigenesis drug resistance . Malignancy usually origins abnormal proliferate cell accumulate several genetic epigenetic aberration . The important key question `` What kind cell could cancer cell ? '' Recent study figure `` cancer-initiating cell '' malignant tumor . Cancer-initiating cell organize self-renewing , anchorage-independent sphere reproducibly . Moreover , cancer-initiating cell also capable intraperitoneal tumorigenesis ( demonstrate activity native microenvironment ) could serially propagate tumor animal . Although proportion cancer-initiating cell cancer tissue low , characteristic ability cancer-initiating cell fulfill currently accept criterion existence subpopulation tumor-initiating cell , specific detection target could highly valuable therapy tumor heterogeneity , uncontrolled proliferation , local invasion , distant metastasis even resistance current management include chemotherapy . Some tumor initiate cell property cancer stem cell isolated leukemia , breast cancer , brain tumor . Some potential cell marker cancer initiate cell identify , include CD34 ( + ) /CD38 ( + ) leukemia , CD44 ( + ) /CD24 ( + ) breast cancer , CD133 ( + ) /nestin ( + ) brain tumor . Aberrant cell signal transduction pathway stem cell associate malignant transformation , Wnt , Hedgehog , Notch pathway . Up knowledge , specific antigen express ovarian cancer-initiating cell identify characterize yet . In current study , use primary human ovarian tumor , investigator isolate characterize ovarian cancer-initiating cell fully capable reestablish original tumor hierarchy vivo . The investigator also elucidate novel diagnostic prognostic biomarkers ovarian cancer-initiating cell identify numerous differentially potential surface antigen and/or over-expressed gene . Furthermore , mouse ovarian cancer study model genetically engineer investigate monitor possible therapeutic effect immunotherapy chemotherapy ovarian cancer-initiating cell . The investigator hope specify stratify molecular pattern , response chemotherapy , prognostic biomarkers patient ovarian cancer-initiating cell . These result might offer novel ovarian cancer therapy hypothesis evaluate function tumorigenesis potential target ovarian cancer-initiating cell .</detailed_description>
