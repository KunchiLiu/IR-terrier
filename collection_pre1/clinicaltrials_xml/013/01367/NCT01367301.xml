	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study radiation therapy , paclitaxel , carboplatin treat patient uterine cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess one year recurrence-free survival patient uterine carcinosarcoma treat `` sandwich '' therapy-including defining pattern recurrence patient carcinosarcoma treated regimen . II . To evaluate toxicity tolerability pelvic radiation `` sandwich '' cycle paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy patient uterine carcinosarcoma . III . To correlate surrogate endpoint biomarkers progression-free survival prognosis . OUTLINE : CHEMOTHERAPY ( week 1-9 , 14-22 ) : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course week 1-9 14-22 . RADIATION THERAPY ( week 8-16 ) : Patients undergo external beam pelvic radiation therapy day , 5 day week 5 week week 8-13 . Patients undergo high dose radiation ( HDR ) brachytherapy intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) weekly week 14-16 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
