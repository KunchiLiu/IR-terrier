	<brief_summary>This study aim describe use glutamine supplementation modulation inflammatory response critically ill pediatric patient determine decrease lead clinical improvement morbidity mortality patient . Thus , patient ' diet could supplement glutamine order improve evolution . Hypothesis : From data obtain study literature investigator consider : Critically ill patient deficit glutamine either increase consumption decrease availability , therefore blood glutamine level low . Critically ill patient elevate blood level pro-inflammatory substance ( IL-6 ) . In patient tissue lesion inhibitor ( HSP-70 ) blood decrease . The administration glutamine supplement patient decrease oxidative stress due increase HSP-70 . Inflammation inhibitory substance ( IL-10 ) blood decreased patient . The administration glutamine supplement patient increase IL-10 level . Glutamine supplement decrease inflammatory response decrease IL-6 level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective This study aim describe use glutamine supplementation modulation inflammatory response critically ill pediatric patient determine decrease lead clinical improvement morbidity mortality patient . Thus , patient ' diet could supplement glutamine order improve evolution . In recent year numerous study conduct publish different factor , amongst glutamine , could modulate inflammatory response critically ill patient thus reduce impact response progression multi-organ failure . Glutamine ( Gln ) abundant amino acid body mainly synthesise skeletal muscle . It non-essential amino acid produce sufficient quantity good state health . Plasma level 0.6 mmol/L , 50 % find free form plasma1 . This amino acid act source energy also involved synthesis amino acid , nucleotide , nucleic acid , sugar , amine , protein different biologically active molecules2 . Other function : maintenance internal acid-base homeostasis , urea synthesis , glyconeogenesis , neurotransmission , cell differentiation proliferation . It also main energy substrate rapidly proliferate cell ( enterocytes ) multiple immune cell ( macrophage , monocyte , lymphocyte ) . It also take part protection cell tissue induce expression heat shock proteins3 . In recent year , numerous study perform determine effect Gln , enteral parenteral route , evolution critically ill patient . These study conduct animal human , mainly adult . However , little reference literature study child . The study base use glutamine dietary supplement mainly patient neoplastic disease inflammatory bowel disease . It also study supplement premature infant , study critically ill child . In last year many study publish use glutamine . The effect glutamine supplementation intestinal mucosal barrier rabbit haemorrhagic shock study . Shock induce blood withdraw femoral artery ; rabbit randomise three group ( control , low dose glutamine high dose glutamine ) . Plasma level diamine oxidase IL-8 measure histological examination terminal ileum perform . The result demonstrate low inflammatory oxidative response rabbit receive Gln supplementation37 . Another study rat measure effect dipeptide Arginin - Gln endothelial cell growth factor level retinal pigment epithelial cell culture inhibition neovascularisation oxygen-induced retinopathy . The author conclude decreased administration dipeptide38 . Another factor study critically ill patient oxidative activity measure diamine oxidase activity D-lactate content39 . Protection infection decrease insulin resistance critically ill patient still study 21,22 , 32 , 40 , 41 . Contradictory finding report therefore new study require systematic review .</detailed_description>
