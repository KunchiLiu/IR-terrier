	<brief_summary>Traumatic Central Cord Syndrome ( TCCS ) recent recognize separate clinical entity . The characteristic feature disproportionate motor impairment arm especially hand legs , bladder dysfunction sensory . Recently , show distinction TCCS incomplete cervical spinal cord lesion ( ICSCL ) artificial . It frequent incomplete traumatic spinal cord lesion . It account 70 % incomplete cervical spinal cord lesion . The exact incidence know . Uncertainty treatment exists . A good recovery describe conservative treatment . Conservative treatment usually consider fracture dislocation spine absent . It often see hyperextension trauma elderly degenerative spondylotic stenotic cervical spine . However , report suggest well outcome surgical decompression . Randomized trial perform . To avoid discussion possible confound effect modification relate mechanism trauma , study focus ICSCL patient without fracture instability cervical spine radiological examination . Also problem crossover conservative group surgical one due nature spinal instability reduce . Goal study : To compare efficacy early decompressive surgery improve functional outcome patient ICSCL without fracture instability cervical spine compare receive conservative treatment . Definition ICSCL study : ICSCL incomplete spinal cord lesion due cervical spine trauma . At CT scan reconstruction MRI sign see could indicate fracture cervical spine instability . An overt sequestrate herniated disc present since always necessitate immediate surgery . Involvement cervical spinal cord establish physical examination ( symptomatic arm hand dysfunction obligatory ) .</brief_summary>
