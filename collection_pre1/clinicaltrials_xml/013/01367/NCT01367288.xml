	<brief_summary>Breast cancer lead female cancer wide margin France . Despite widespread breast cancer screening , many case breast cancer discover locally advanced stage . The tumoral consequence cancer size great 3 cm : increase risk metastasis death , often , impossibility perform breast-conserving surgery ( mastectomy usually advisable case first surgical procedure ) . It increasingly recommend treat locally advance breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Very numerous study show proceed way , oncologic prognosis harm , contrary , possible obtain sufficient tumor response allow breast-conserving treatment 60 % case . The use zoledronic acid ( Zometa ) establish place management malignancy predilection skeletal involvement ( particular metastasis ) . Although main target biphosphonates osteoclast , also preclinical data indicate biphosphonates effect cell osteoclast , include tumor cell . Anti-tumor activity include inhibition tumor cell growth induction tumor cell apoptosis , inhibition tumor cell adhesion invasion , anti-angiogenic effect demonstrate . In addition several vitro study show Zometa cause synergistic induction breast cancer cell apoptosis combine clinically relevant concentration chemotherapy drug paclitaxel doxorubicin . Therefore test combination biphosphonates agent breast cancer significant interest . In context locally advanced breast cancer , combination bisphosphonate neoadjuvant chemotherapy appear important potential : preventing possible bone metastasis , also possibly amplify efficacy chemotherapy 's tumoricidal activity , primary tumor potential metastatic localization . So appear , use bisphosphonates neoadjuvant situation present potentially favorable benefit-risk ratio . That propose perform prospective randomize multicenter comparative study evaluate 2 systemic neoadjuvant treatment , one Zometa without Zometa , patient locally advance breast cancer . Zometa administer accord usual administration procedure : one infusion every 3 week . The therapeutic response evaluate study different biological marker ( circulate blood bone marrow tumor cell , serum cell apoptosis neoangiogenesis marker , bone resorption marker , etc . ) , also analyze clinical , radiologic , histologic response breast conservation rate . The impact factor may affect therapeutic response take account : aggressivity tumor , presence absence tumor receptor , tumor stage , etc . The purpose study show mark benefit treatment Zometa manage locally advance breast cancer synergistic action neoadjuvant chemotherapy improvement laboratory parameter tumor aggressivity . These marker use surrogate marker long term outcome .</brief_summary>
