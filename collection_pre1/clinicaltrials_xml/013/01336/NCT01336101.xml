	<brief_summary>The intent clinical registry demonstrate efficacy EPIC™ stent patient superficial femoral/ popliteal artery disease . 100 patient symptomatic femoropopliteal artery lesion enrol study shall undergo 4 visit trial -a pre-procedure visit , procedure visit time stent place , follow-up visit 6 12 month . Study hypothesis : The EPIC™ Self-Expanding Nitinol Vascular Stent Delivery System efficacious patient Superficial Femoro/Popliteal Artery disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficacy EPIC™ Self-Expanding Nitinol Vascular Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The SUMMIT Registry address treatment peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . PAD represent major challenge physician treat Superficial Femoral ( SFA ) Popliteal artery . These vessel expose enormous mechanical stress represent harsh environment endovascular device . During flex knee , SFA/Popliteal arteries bend , rotate , elongate compress dramatically . An ideal stent design use SFA/Popliteal artery would offer great range movement adequately support artery . Subject study EPIC™ Femoropopliteal Self-Expanding Stent System provide great range motion highly flexible femoral artery adequately support vessel . Primary objective evaluate efficacy device treat lesion SFA/Popliteal artery . The project multi-centre open label study . Primary efficacy parameter assess measure in-stent binary stenosis use duplex ultrasound 6 12 month stent placement . Binary restenosis define peak systolic velocity ratio ( PSVR ) ≥2.5:1 . Anticipated study duration 18 month : 6 month recruit 12 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
