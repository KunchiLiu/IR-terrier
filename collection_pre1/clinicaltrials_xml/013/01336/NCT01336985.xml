	<brief_summary>Background : - Cancers part body often spread liver , develop tumor many instance remove surgery . Liver chemoembolization treatment routinely perform control liver tumor surgery . It show prolong survival , cure cancer . During chemoembolization tiny bead ( drug-eluting bead , DEB ) contain chemotherapy drug ( usually doxorubicin ) administer directly blood vessel liver tumor . The drug within bead release tumor whilethe bead temporarily interrupt tumor blood supply . - Irinotecan , drug commonly give intravenously treat colon cancer , give chemoembolization procedure four study show treatment generally well tolerate . Researchers interested determine whether give drug irinotecan directly liver use drug-eluting bead well tolerate also provide large dose directly tumor determine tumor normal liver tissue biopsy . The liver biopsies optional portion study . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness chemoembolization irinotecan tumor cause cancer spread liver . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age melanoma , colon , another intra-abdominal cancer spread liver . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , tumor image study , liver biopsy . - Participants receive 3 DEB chemoembolization treatment 6 week apart . - After two treatment , participant image study see tumor shrink , whose tumor shrink may third treatment . - Multiple liver biopsy may perform blood sample take determine much drug tumor circulation , see tumor reacts drug . - Participants return followup visit 1 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Clinical evidence suggest hepatic chemoembolization may prolong survival patient hepatic metastasis . - Early study indicate chemoembolization use irinotecan drug elute bead may effective treat hepatic metastasis colon melanoma primary tumor . Objectives : - Primary Objective : -- To determine safety hepatic chemoembolization drug-eluting bead contain 100mg irinotecan - Secondary Objectives : - To determine serum pharmacokinetics tumor tissue concentration achieve follow hepatic chemoembolization irinotecan-eluting bead Eligibility : - Patients &gt; 18 year age pathologically proven hepatic metastasis gastrointestinal tract , melanoma unresectable hepatic lesion . - Patients whose extent hepatic metastasis represent &lt; 60 % total liver volume AND whose extrahepatic metastatic disease determine minimal - Patients must ECOG performance status less equal 2 life expectancy 3 month . - Patients must adequate organ function . - Patients must chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biological therapy least 4 week prior start study treatment . - Patients receive conventional chemotherapy therapeutic monoclonal antibody study . - Patients must acute , critical illness . Design : - A Phase Ib trial patient undergo hepatic chemoembolization drug-eluting bead contain 100mg irinotecan . - Up 15 patient enrol 1 year accrue 10 evaluable patient . - Patients undergo 3 chemoembolizations . - Following chemoembolization , patient serial serum pharmacokinetic sample draw tumor biopsy order measure serum tumor tissue concentration irinotecan - Patients follow one year completion last treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients pathologically proven hepaticdominant metastasis abdominal gastrointestinal tract primary malignancy melanoma life limit component disease hepatic metastasis Patients must unresectable hepatic lesion must unable unwilling undergo surgical resection . Patients may undergo prior wedge resection liver metastatic disease All patient must refractory intolerant approve standard systemic therapy . Specifically : Patients metastatic colorectal must receive 5FU leucovorin combination either oxaliplatin and/or irinotecan , since level 1 evidence support increase survival regimen , compare 5FU leucovorin alone . Patients melanoma must receive IL2 immunotherapy option ( ipilimumab adoptive cell therapy ) report efficacy . Patients extrahepatic metastasis unresected primary lesion consider eligible extrahepatic disease minimal Extent hepatic metastasis &lt; 60 % total hepatic volume . Patients must least one lesion readily biopsied ( least 10mm diameter ) ECOG performance status less equal 2 Life expectancy &gt; 3 month At least 18 year age Age &lt; 85 year Patients must chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic therapy malignancy least 4 week ( response adequately assess ) prior treatment must recover clinically significant side effect therapeutic diagnostic intervention . AntiVEGF agent ( eg , Avastin ) may administer less 4 week prior DEBTACE treatment . Patients receive conventional chemotherapy therapeutic monoclonal antibody receive protocol treatment Hematology : Absolute neutrophil count great 1500/mm ( 3 ) without support Filgrastim . Platelet count great 75,000/mm ( 3 ) . Hemoglobin great 8.0 g/dl . Chemistry : Serum ALT/AST less equal 3 time upper limit normal . Serum creatinine less equal 2.0 mg/dl unless measure creatinine clearance great 60 mL/min Total bilirubin less equal 2 mg/dl . INR &lt; 1.5 PTT less equal 1.3 time control unless mix study confirms presence lupus anticoagulant cause prolong PTT . Screening electrocardiogram normal QTc le equal 480msec ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Significant cardiac pulmonary insufficiency evidence history congestive heart failure LVEF &lt; 40 % history COPD chronic pulmonary disease PFT indicate FEV1 le 30 % DLCO le 40 % predict age Portal Vein Occlusion contraindication chemoembolization Inflammatory bowel disease Prior chemoembolization therapy Prior precutaneous hepatic perfusion therapy Prior selective internal radiation therapy ( SIRT ) Yttrium90 Prior biliary diversion surgery Previous liver resection wedge resection . Pregnant patient nurse mother exclude unknown effect therapy fetus nursing infant . Patients take immunosuppressive drug require ongoing chronic anticoagulation eligible . Patients active bacterial infection systemic manifestation ( malaise , fever , leucocytosis ) eligible completion appropriate therapy . Patients severe allergic reaction iodine contrast control premedication antihistamine steroid eligible hepatic angiogram need procedure . Patients know prior hypersensitivity reaction contraindication irinotecan exclude . Patients take phenytoin , phenobarbital , carbamazepine , rifampin , rifabutin , St. John Wort , CYP3A inducers inhibitor eligible study . Patients prohibit receive experimental agents/adjuvant treatment study . Patients one active primary malignancy , except basal cell carcinoma superficial bladder neoplasia , exclude .</criteria>
