	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Pralatrexate First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate Phase II study preliminary estimate complete response ( CR ) rate new chemotherapy regimen involve Cyclophosphamide , Etoposide , Vincristine Prednisone ( CEOP ) alternate Pralatrexate ( P ) front line therapy patient Stage II , III IV Peripheral T-Cell NHL otherwise specify ( NOS ) , Anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALK negative ) , Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma , Enteropathy associate T-cell lymphoma , Hepatosplenic gamma delta T-cell lymphoma follow optional stem cell transplant high dose chemotherapy Autologous stem cell transplant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate partial response ( PR ) . II . To evaluate overall response ( CR+PR ) . III . To evaluate safety tolerability regimen . IV . To assess 2 year event free survival ( EFS ) overall survival ( OS ) use regimen . V. To assess percentage patient intend receive transplant versus actually proceed transplant . VI . To evaluate ability collect peripheral blood stem cell regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) vincristine sulfate IV day 1 , etoposide IV day 1-3 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 2-3 , prednisone PO QD day 1-5 ( CEOP administration ) . Patients also receive pralatrexate IV 3-5 minute day 15 , 22 , 29 ( P administration ) . Treatment repeat every 42 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients CR PR , per investigator discretion , may undergo hematopoietic stem cell collection administration standard preparative regimen follow hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year ( transplant patient ) periodically .</detailed_description>
