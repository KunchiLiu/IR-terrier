	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) single agent carfilzomib patient relapse refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) include angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ( AITL ) , anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase ( ALK ) +/ALK- , adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATLL ) , natural killer ( NK ) -cell lymphoma ( NKL ) , transform mycosis fungoides ( MF ) large cell , PTCL-unspecified ( PTCL-U ) . II . To assess safety preliminary efficacy single agent carfilzomib patient relapse refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) include angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ( AITL ) , anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) ALK+/ALK- , adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATLL ) , NK-cell lymphoma ( NKL ) , transform mycosis fungoides ( MF ) large cell , PTCL-unspecified ( PTCL-U ) . III . To evaluate nuclear transcription factor kappa-B ( NF-kappa B ) activation PTCL tumor tissue correlate response carfilzomib , novel proteosome inhibitor , target NF-kappa B . OUTLINE : This dose escalation study . Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month year 1 , every 4 month year 2 , every 6 month year 3 4 , yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
