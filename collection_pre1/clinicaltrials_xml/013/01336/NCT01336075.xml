	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare two invasive treatment symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation : Percutaneous radiofrequency catheter ablation mini invasive thoracoscopic radiofrequency ablation patient refer first time invasive treatment atrial fibrillation . The hypothesis , mini invasive thoracoscopic radiofrequency ablation first time invasive treatment effective compare percutaneous catheter base technique patient symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation refractory intolerant least one antiarrhythmic drug .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation characterize disorganize , rapid , irregular contraction atrium . Its effect hemodynamic thromboembolic event result significant morbidity , mortality , impaired quality life , hospitalization , health-cost . It common sustain cardiac arrhythmia . Over six million Europeans suffer arrhythmia . The prevalence estimate least double next 50 year probably underestimate due asymptomatic atrial fibrillation . The prevalence increase age affect men often . Atrial fibrillation treat medically vary result definitive long term curative treatment . The main goal aim reduce symptom prevent disable complication . Treatment normally include antithrombotic , rhythm , and/or rate management , New non-pharmacological intervention evolve last decade order prevent paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and/or reduce symptom . The main focus non-pharmacological intervention percutaneous radiofrequency catheter ablation surgical maze ablation . Both approach aim minimize impact `` trigger '' pulmonary vein electrical isolation vein . Studies compare antiarrhythmic drug radiofrequency ablation indicate radiofrequency ablation high efficacy rate , low rate complication , select patient radiofrequency ablation reduce risk atrial fibrillation recurrence one year 65 % compare antiarrhythmic drug . In recently publish paper success rate mean 1.3 radiofrequency ablation procedure per patient vary 57.7 % 75.4 % high success rate patient paroxysmal atrial fibrillation compare persistent/permanent atrial fibrillation . European Society Cardiology recommend radiofrequency ablation reserve patient remain symptomatic despite optimal therapy fail least one antiarrhythmic drug . Dr. James Cox introduce Cox-maze surgical operation atrial fibrillation 1987 , later modify Cox-maze III also know `` cut sew '' maze . It highly successful restore sinus rhythm , 90-96 % free atrial fibrillation mean follow-up 5.4 year . Due complexity technical difficulty procedure widely adopt . Mini invasive procedure pulmonary vein isolation develop perform either mini thoracotomy use totally thoracoscopic approach . These procedure also hold advantage leave atrial appendage excision exclusion . The thoracoscopic maze ablation show promising result small study patient recurrence atrial fibrillation earlier catheter base radiofrequency ablation , mean follow-up 11 month 84 % patient remain sinus rhythm . However long-term result still unknown . The procedure still need compare head head catheter base radiofrequency ablation offer standard treatment atrial fibrillation . The rationale eliminate atrial fibrillation radiofrequency ablation include potential improvement quality life , decrease stroke risk , decrease heart failure risk improve survival .</detailed_description>
