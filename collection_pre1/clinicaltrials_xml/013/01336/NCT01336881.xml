	<brief_title>Biomarkers Tissue Samples From Young Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify biomarker signature associate hepatoblastoma subtypes ( microRNA array profiling ) , potential correlation liver developmental stage well outcome . II . To correlate expression array data copy number array data . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To carry focused sequence interrogation amplify deleted genomic region well gene key cell pathway involve embryonic development and/or stem cell signal pathway preliminary data suggest involvement pathogenesis hepatoblastoma . II . To perform whole exome sequence subset tumor . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Archived tumor tissue sample analyze hepatoblastoma liver tumor biomarkers microRNA array profile exome sequencing . Results compare patient ' clinical data .</detailed_description>
