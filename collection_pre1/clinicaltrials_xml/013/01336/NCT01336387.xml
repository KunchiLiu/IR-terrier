	<brief_title>Dose-Finding Retinoid 9cUAB30 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The primary objective determine toxicity recommend phase II dose 9cUAB30 . The co- primary objective characterize urine plasma single dose steady state pharmacokinetics 9cUAB30 normal volunteer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate pharmacokinetics 9cUAB30 toxicity . II . To compare observed toxicity placebo control dose level . III . To assess change single dose PK repeat dosing ( Day 1 vs. Day 36 ) . IV . To assess follow potential biomarkers UAB30 : - Telomerase activity ( measurement telomeric repeat ) PBMCs . - Gene expression DNA methyltransferase PBMCs . - Gene expression CYP2B6 PBMCs . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Participants randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Participants receive retinoid 9cUAB30* orally ( PO ) day 1-28 . ARM II : Participants receive placebo* PO day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity . *NOTE : Participants receive dos day 8 , 15 , 22 29 fast 12 hour . After completion study treatment , patient follow day 7 30 .</detailed_description>
