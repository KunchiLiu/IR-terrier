Imaging procedure allow doctor accurately differentiate malignant bone sarcoma osteomyelitis may help diagnose patient correctly may result timely treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Differentiation Bone Sarcomas Osteomyelitis With Ferumoxytol-Enhanced MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish magnetic resonance ( MR ) image characteristic bone sarcoma osteomyelitis base ferumoxytol-enhancement relatively early postcontrast T1-weighted image . II . Establish MR image characteristic bone sarcoma osteomyelitis base ferumoxytol-enhancement delayed postcontrast T2-weighted image . III . Establish T2-weighted MR image characteristic iron label mesenchymal stem cell ( MSC ) osteonecrotic bone time , surgical core decompression bone marrow implantation . IV . Adding second branch patient receive ferumoxytol still get MRI exam . OUTLINE : Patients receive ferumoxytol intravenously ( IV ) undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced MRI 1 hour infusion 24 hour post-infusion .</detailed_description>
