	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II study histology base consolidation chemotherapy patient inoperable stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) follow concurrent chemo-radiotherapy . Patients inoperable stage III NSCLC would treat standard concurrent chemo-radiotherapy subsequently non-squamous histology would offer 4 cycle consolidation pemetrexed squamous histology 4 cycle consolidation gemcitabine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Consolidation Chemotherapy/Concurrent Chemo-radiotherapy Inoperable Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) lead cause cancer relate mortality US ( 1 ) . About 22 % patient diagnose NSCLC locally advance stage III disease time diagnosis ( 2 ) . 5 year survival stage III lung cancer 23 % much less survival similar stage breast Colon Cancers ( 2 ) . Current standard care inoperable stage III NSCLC concurrent chemo-radiotherapy establish study ( Southwestern Oncology Group ) SWOG 9019 ( 3 ) . Surgery follow concurrent chemo-radiotherapy evaluate large Phase III clinical trial patient Stage III ( N2 ) disease show improvement overall survival surgery compare concurrent chemo-radiotherapy alone. ( 4 ) . These two study demonstrate common site cancer relapse patient stage III disease distant metastasis , 65 % ( 3 ) 57 % ( 4 ) respectively . These observation lead idea perhaps give additional chemotherapy follow definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy may prevent distant relapse stage III NSCLC . This idea evaluate Phase II study SWOG S9504 patient stage III NSCLC treat concurrent chemo-radiotherapy follow 4 cycle docetaxel consolidation ( 5 ) . Four cycle docetaxel consolidation show impressive improvement median Overall Survival ( OS ) 26 month . This idea docetaxel consolidation subsequently evaluate large phase III trial patient inoperable stage III NSCLC receive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy randomize docetaxel consolidation versus observation ( 6 ) . However , study show improvement OS docetaxel arm observation arm . Many patient docetaxel arm develop pneumonitis febrile neutropenia . Histology base selection chemotherapy standard stage IV metastatic NSCLC . A large randomized Phase III trial Europe show combination Cisplatin Pemetrexed effective patient non-squamous histology combination Cisplatin Gemcitabine show efficacy patient squamous cell histology ( 7 ) . Recently maintenance Pemetrexed evaluate advanced NSCLC show improvement PFS OS patient non-squamous histology ( 8 ) . Similarly maintenance gemcitabine also evaluate large Phase III clinical trial initial chemotherapy Cisplatin Gemcitabine ( 9 ) . Since patient inoperable stage III NSCLC develop distant metastasis follow definitive concurrent chemo-radiotherapy clearly need give addition treatment patient . Docetaxel consolidation show successful note . Perhaps tailor chemotherapy accord histology may result improvement PFS OS patient . Based hypothesis investigator intend pilot phase II study histology base consolidation chemotherapy patient inoperable stage III NSCLC follow concurrent chemo-radiotherapy . Patients inoperable stage III NSCLC would treat standard concurrent chemo-radiotherapy subsequently non-squamous histology would offer 4 cycle consolidation pemetrexed squamous histology 4 cycle consolidation gemcitabine .</detailed_description>
