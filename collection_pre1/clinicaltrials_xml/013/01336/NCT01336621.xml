	<detailed_description>RTG113413 open-label , multicentre extension study RGB113905 . This study enrol adult subject partial-onset seizure ( POS ) successfully complete 20 week adjunctive treatment retigabine IR ( 4-weeks Titration Phase 16-weeks Flexible Dose Evaluation Phase ) parent study , RGB113905 think benefit treatment . The Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) perform day final visit parent study ( Visit 7/Week 20 ) . Subjects enter extension study initially receive dose retigabine IR concurrent antiepileptic drug ( AED ) receive final visit parent study . After first week extension study , subject 's retigabine dose adjust base efficacy tolerability . The overall daily dose retigabine IR must maintain 300 mg/day ( minimum ) 1200 mg/day ( maximum ) . In addition , dose number concurrent AEDs adjust meet individual need subject . Retigabine IR monotherapy permit . If concurrent AED therapy remove , subject must withdraw study . Subjects study eligible receive retigabine IR treatment one follow criterion meet : ) regulatory approval commercial availability retigabine IR ii ) retigabine IR approve regulatory authority iii ) study terminate sponsor reason include , limited , safety issue iv ) subject withdrawn withdraws consent v ) subject receive retigabine IR treatment total 3 year option i-iv met . After Screening Visit , subject require attend 4 clinic visit Weeks 13 , 26 , 39 , 52 first year study total 3 clinic visit approximately 4-monthly interval second third year study .
