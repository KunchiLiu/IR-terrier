	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Surgery without internal radiation therapy may effective treatment non-small cell lung cancer . Internal radiation use radioactive material place directly near tumor kill tumor cell . Stereotactic body radiation therapy may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know whether stereotactic body radiation therapy effective surgery without internal radiation therapy treat non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well surgery without internal radiation therapy work compare stereotactic body radiation therapy treat patient high-risk stage IA stage IB non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery With Without Internal Radiation Therapy Compared With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With High-Risk Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To ascertain whether patient treat stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) 3-year overall survival ( OS ) rate 10 % less patient treat sublobar resection ( SR ) . Secondary - To compare loco-regional recurrence-free survival study arm . - To compare disease-free survival study arm . - To compare grade 3 high specific adverse event profile study arm 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month post-therapy . - To compare pulmonary function patient treat SBRT patient treat SR. - To compare adverse event pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) arm patient low high Charlson comorbidity index score , include test interaction Charlson comorbidity index score ( low vs high ) treatment arm . Tertiary - To compare quality-adjusted survival SBRT SR treatment term time death ( primary ) time recurrence ( secondary ) . - To examine whether pre-operative post-operative clinically significant deficit previously identify prognostic PRO domain ( overall quality life [ QOL ] , fatigue , anxiety , dyspnea ) associate short patient survival patient population compare relative effectiveness treatment ( SBRT SR ) . - To contribute ACOSOG bank normative data order improve short/long-term outcome cancer patient identify patient experience clinically significant deficit patient-reported outcome relationship genetic variable . - To explore whether blood-based biomarkers , include osteopontins , able predict patient high risk recurrence treatment either SBRT SR. ( exploratory ) - To explore whether blood-based biomarkers , include TGF-β1 , able predict patient high risk pulmonary complication treatment either SBRT SR. ( exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord plan brachytherapy ( yes v ) ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo sublobar resection comprise either wedge resection anatomical segmentectomy without intraoperative brachytherapy* comprise iodine I 125 implant resection margin . - Arm II : Patients undergo 3 fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy 2-8 day apart . NOTE : *Patients may receive brachytherapy discretion treat physician . Patients may undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study correlative study . Tumor tissue sample may also collect patient undergo resection . Patients complete Lung Cancer Symptom Scale ( LCSS ) , Linear Analogue Self-Assessment ( LASA ) , UCDS Shortness Breath quality-of-life questionnaire baseline periodically study follow-up . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year , yearly 2 year .</detailed_description>
