	<brief_summary>Purpose : Mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) extremely common among OEF/OIF ( Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom ) era Veterans . Mild TBI frequently accompany post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) depression symptom , co-occurring disorder contribute increase disability decrease quality life . Neuroactive steroid ( NS ) represent promise pharmacological candidate intervention diverse symptom domain , since number molecule demonstrate pronounce neuroprotective neurotrophic property . The NS pregnenolone ( PREG ) logical therapeutic option , since enhances learn memory also increase myelination rodent model . Further , decrease PREG associate depressive symptom , PREG also metabolize allopregnanolone ( ALLO ) , anxiolytic downstream NS decrease PTSD . ALLO also enhance neurogenesis rodent . The investigator thus propose RCT OEF/OIF era Veterans mild TBI . Methodology : The design study randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind . Trial duration 10 week , consist 2-week placebo lead-in period subject , follow 8 week treatment either pregnenolone placebo . The primary cognitive outcome measure executive functioning ( assess Tower London test ) , primary behavioral outcome measure PTSD Cluster D symptom ( assessed Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale , CAPS ) . The investigator also determine PREG administration OEF/OIF Veterans mild TBI increase downstream ALLO and/or GABAergic NS level , investigator identify specific metabolism profile PREG follow eight week treatment neurosteroid . Anticipated Findings : The investigator hypothesize treatment PREG OEF/OIF era Veterans mild TBI significantly improve executive functioning compare placebo condition . The investigator also predict treatment PREG decrease Cluster D PTSD symptom compare treatment placebo .</brief_summary>

A subset patient also receive pre/post neuroimaging ( functional magnetic resonance image [ fMRI ] , diffusion tensor image [ DTI ] , quantitative susceptibility mapping/susceptibility tensor image [ QSM/STI ] ) . Anticipated Findings : The investigator hypothesize treatment PREG OEF/OIF era Veterans mild TBI significantly improve executive functioning compare placebo condition .

	<criteria>2155 year age , ethnic group , either sex History mild TBI since 2001 The investigator adhere operational definition mild TBI suggest World Health Organization Task Force ( Holm et al 2005 ) , exception Glasgow Coma Scale score criterion ( available subject ) : . ) One following : confusion disorientation , loss consciousness 30 minute less , posttraumatic amnesia le 24 hour , and/or transient neurological abnormality focal sign , seizure , intracranial lesion require surgery ; Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) score 1315 30 minute postinjury later upon presentation health care ( GCS unavailable ) . This WHO diagnostic definition mild TBI also consistent CDC Report Congress Mild TBI United States , September 2003 ( specifically , alter consciousness attributable head injury [ =transient confusion , disorientation impair consciousness ] self report loss consciousness last 30 minute less ) . Ability participate fully informed consent process . No anticipated need alter psychiatric medication 10week duration study . Since study adjunctive treatmentasusual , patient taper psychiatric medication may receive enrollment . No change psychotropic behavioral intervention study 4 week prior study enrollment . For pilot study , investigator diverge slightly WHO definition mild TBI exclude patient report history seizure investigation . Although seizure report FDA relationship pregnenolone use , pregnenolone could theoretically influence seizure threshold metabolize sulfated derivative , demonstrate negative modulatory action GABAA receptor . Since preliminary data suggest pregnenolone administration increase GABAergic neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone fivefold , however , since allopregnanolone demonstrate marked anticonvulsant activity number animal seizure model , theoretical risk may small nonexistent . Subjects current suicidal homicidal ideation necessitate clinical intervention represent imminent concern . Concomitant medication medical condition address casebycase base determine exclusionary . Current DSMIV diagnosis bipolar disorder , schizophrenia psychotic disorder , cognitive disorder due general medical condition TBI . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding . Known allergy study medication . Substance dependence abuse ( nicotine dependence ) , determine MINI assessment . Serious unstable medical illness . History cerebrovascular accident , prostate , uterine breast cancer . Use oral contraceptive hormonal supplementation estrogen [ although early study suggest effect menstrual cycle , alteration downstream metabolite pregnenolone could theoretically impact efficacy oral contraceptive estrogen replacement ] .</criteria>
