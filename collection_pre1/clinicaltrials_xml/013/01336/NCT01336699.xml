	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Two Live , Attenuated Oral Shigella Sonnei Vaccines : WRSs2 WRSs3</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , randomize , double-blind , placebo control , dose-escalation , inpatient study . Subjects receive single oral dose WRSs2 , WRSs3 placebo . Five dos vaccine , range 1x10^3 1x10^7 colony form unit ( cfu ) evaluate study . For dose , cohort 18 subject ( n=18 ) randomize 3 group receive WRSs2 ( n=8 ) , WRSs3 ( n=8 ) placebo ( n=2 ) . The three group receive approximately inoculum dose . Ingestion vaccine precede ingestion sodium bicarbonate buffer . Subjects enrol serial group escalate dos enable identification dose minimize reactogenicity induce robust immune response allow head-to-head comparison 2 vaccine candidate . Dose escalation proceed approximately 1 log10 cfu level base observation precede group ( maximum dose 1x10^7 cfu ) . During 10-13 day inpatient monitoring period , subject evaluate least twice daily . This assessment include ask symptom may experience , targeted question reactogenic symptom twice day . Additional assessment include daily measurement vital sign , daily-history direct physical examination collection , grade ( consistency ) stool along weigh loose watery stool . Stool specimens rectal swab ( unable produce stool ) also evaluate grossly visible occult blood culture presence vaccine strain . All volunteer receive antibiotic therapy 8 day inoculation ( unless meet criterion early treatment ) . Subjects discharge initiate antibiotic treatment pass 2 consecutive stool ( least 6 hour apart ) negative S. sonnei use standard stool culture identification technique . Following evaluation history-directed physical examination , subject discharge , follow-up study day 14+/-1 , 28+/-2 56+/-4 provide additional specimen safety check immunology monitor . Subjects give ice-pack cooler collection stool sample home bring clinic day follow-up visit . An interim safety report compile finding precede group PI 's interpretation plan go forward . The Data Safety Monitoring board ( DSMB ) /Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) equivalent must concur plan proceed . The decision advance next high dose level base solely safety profile test dose level make independently vaccine candidate . The next inpatient group ( next high dose ) admit minimum 4 week elapse time precede group 's vaccination ensure adequate time safety monitoring . The primary objective : evaluate safety clinical tolerance WRSs2 WRSs3 monitor presence severity clinical sign symptom . The secondary objective : evaluate immune response blood stool follow ingestion WRSs2 WRSs3 ; assess frequency duration fecal shed WRSs2 WRSs3 follow ingestion ; ass secondary infectious spread different vaccine strain ( WRSs2 WRSs3 ) subject .</detailed_description>
