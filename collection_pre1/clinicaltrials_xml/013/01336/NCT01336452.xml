	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma sixth common malignancy third common cause cancer-related death worldwide . The incidence HCC rise Europe United States expect continue increase next 2 3 decade . The expected survival rate still decimal , especially patient advance HCC . However , recent year , several treatment method patient advance HCC , include antiangiogenic chemotherapy , radiotherapy , concurrent chemoradiotherapy , DC bead transarterial chemoembolization , develop . Among new treatment method , concurrent chemoradiotherapy also prove increase patient 's survival rate . It important predict treatment response treatment immediately treatment several treatment option mention . Recently , several report MR perfusion parameter Ktrans predict treatment response cervical cancer colorectal cancer . Therefore purpose investigator study evaluate feasibility predict treatment response MR perfusion , contrast enhance ultrasound parameter biomarkers ( IL-6 , IL-12 VEGF ) patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma undertake concurrent chemoradiotherapy .</brief_summary>
