	<brief_summary>Purpose This study verify validate PAD1 qualitative serum test combine result multiple assay single numeric result , determine evaluation study data . PAD1 automate software device ( PADCalc ) incorporate specific multiple biomarker value find human blood , generate score ( PAD1 score ) use fix formula implement within PADCalc software . The PAD1 score result high low probability PAD . PAD1 submit FDA 510 ( k ) vitro diagnostic use conjunction clinical assessment , base factor age , diabetes , smoking , vascular laboratory test ( include ABI ) , aid towards evaluation patient meet enrollment eligilbility criterion . Eligibility It indicate woman men consider risk PAD meet follow criterion : history smoking and/or diabetes age 50 year old , 70 year age old . PAD1 aid ass likelihood presence PAD use conjunction clinical assessment vascular laboratory test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Evaluation Vermillion 's Blood Test Predict Probability Peripheral Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) affect 8 12 million individual United States also prevalent Europe Asia . A regional pilot study community screen PAD demonstrate patient awareness PAD diagnosis low , associate atherosclerosis risk factor , antiplatelet therapy , claudication treatment intensity . PAD emerge focus public health effort improve quality life , decrease associate cardiovascular ischemic risk . Smoking , diabetes , age strong risk factor PAD . Smokers 2 6-fold increase likelihood PAD , risk PAD increase dose-dependent manner duration amount smoking . Diabetes confers 2 4-fold increase risk PAD . The prevalence PAD increase function age . Criqui et al show prevalence PAD individual 60 year age 2.5 % , whereas prevalence increase 20 % individual 75 year age . A study smoker diabetic 50 year age old , 70 year age old , identified outpatient , primary care clinic set show prevalence 29 % . About half case find newly-identified PAD patient . Further , 83 % prior diagnosis PAD aware condition , 49 % primary-care physician aware patient diagnosis PAD . Another study examine internal medicine physician ' approach PAD find 37 % report take history claudication , 26 % evaluated foot ulcer . PAD prevalent woman men . When symptomatic , PAD cause limb discomfort , tiredness , heaviness , cramp , pain bring exertion relieve rest ( i.e. , intermittent claudication ) reduce functional capacity quality life . Classic claudication note 10-30 % patient atypical leg discomfort occur 20-40 % . Up 50 % patient asymptomatic . PAD1 vitro diagnostic provide PAD1 score derive multiple biomarkers human plasma , serum , whole blood , predict low high probability presence PAD patient risk PAD . A positive PAD1 score ( cutoff ) , indicate high risk PAD expect general population , would guide physician aggressively determine presence PAD . The preliminary study show association four propose biomarkers ABI , demonstrate construction PAD risk algorithm . This study power test four biomarkers interaction develop PAD1 risk score intend use population .</detailed_description>
