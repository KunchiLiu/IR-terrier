	<brief_summary>In study , patient receive myeloablative preparative regimen consist fludarabine total body irradiation ( TBI ) , follow T cell replete , mobilize peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) allograft partially match related donor . All patient receive post-transplant Cy addition standard post transplant immunosuppression tacrolimus MMF . The treatment protocol essentially identical prior study , exception substitution TBI Busulfan . The investigator hypothesize change significantly reduce risk HC , maintain efficacy transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Historically , haploidentical HSCT associate significant risk graft rejection severe graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , lead high treatment relate mortality poor outcome . The risk engraftment failure GVHD may reduce intensively condition recipient graft rigorously deplete T cell , risk serious infection death prolong immune compromise patient remain high . Recently , investigator Johns Hopkins University demonstrate new approach haploidentical transplantation , utilize nonmyeloablative preparative regimen , follow T cell-replete bone marrow infusion post-transplantation immunosuppression high dose Cyclophosphamide ( Cy ) , tacrolimus , MMF . Clinical study show approach safe effective low incidence graft rejection , GVHD , treatment-related mortality . Relapse represent major cause treatment failure patient , particularly high-risk myeloid malignancy . In order decrease relapse risk high-risk patient , investigator initiate myeloablative haploidentical HSCT study January 2009 utilize Busulfan-based conditioning , post-transplant Cy , PBSC , instead BM , stem cell source . Outcomes 15 patient transplanted date promise 100 % engraftment , low rate treatment-related mortality , relapse GVHD , excellent survival rate . An unexpected outcome study higher-than-expected rate BK virus-induced hemorrhagic cystitis ( HC ) occur 7 14 evaluable patient . Although death attributable HC , associate significant morbidity patient . HC recognize complication allogeneic transplant therapy . Late onset HC , occur engraftment , due almost exclusively reactivation polyoma BK virus ( BKV ) . Other important risk factor associate HC include Busulfan-based conditioning , acute GVHD , HLA mismatch transplant , use bone marrow stem cell source . TBI-based conditioning , prior myeloablative allogeneic transplant , associate significantly less HC Busulfan-based conditioning retrospective prospective randomize trial . Eighteen patient accrue study . The primary end point study incidence HC . The investigator also examine incidence acute chronic GVHD , engraftment , degree donor-host chimerism , transplant relate morbidity mortality , well disease-free overall survival . Stopping rule minimize risk untoward unexpected side effect .</detailed_description>
