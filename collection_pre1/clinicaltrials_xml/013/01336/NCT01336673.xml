	<detailed_description>Metformin ( Glucophage ) standard first line therapy patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . The landmark UK Prospective Diabetes Study Group demonstrate significant reduction risk myocardial infarction overall mortality overweight patient type 2 diabetes treat metformin metformin effective control blood glucose compare lifestyle diet-based policy . The observed improvement blood glucose associate weight gain hypoglycaemia contrast treatment either sulphonylurea insulin . It well accept patient ' compliance therapy tend decrease dosage frequency increase regimen simplify far possible support good compliance therapy . The use extended-release formulation metformin ( Glucophage XR® ) may support simplification treatment patient allow once-daily administration metformin . Although patient take metformin significantly low fast postprandial plasma glucose hemoglobin A1C concentration , also high prevalence Gastrointestinal ( GI ) side effect . The commonly report symptom diarrhea ( 53,2 % compare 11,7 % placebo ) . In study employ self-administered questionnaire ascertain GI symptom patient type 2 diabetes approximately 20 % take immediate-release metformin report diarrhea common symptom . Although less 5 % patient discontinue metformin treatment reason , adverse event troublesome , may limit dosage metformin may impair compliance therapy . Glucophage XR may lead improved tolerability , smooth peak trough metformin plasma concentration delay achievement peak plasma concentration , compare immediate-release formulation . Initial placebo-controlled clinical trial Glucophage XR indicate 9,6 % patient report diarrhea ( compare 1,5 % placebo ) . Thus , use Glucophage XR® may provide benefit term improve patient management , enable once-daily dose reduce incidence gastrointestinal side effect patient . A prospective observational study valuable provide information day-to-day experience use Glucophage XR® management patient population . The data may provide insight use Glucophage XR® routine clinical practice Thailand .</detailed_description>
