	<brief_summary>Lung cancer , common cancer worldwide , remain leading cause cancer death . Approximately two-thirds patient newly diagnose non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) present advanced stage palliative chemotherapy appropriate measure . The standard treatment patient population consist third generation platinum-based doublet regimen 6 cycle follow watch wait disease progression ( PD ) administration second-line third-line systemic anticancer therapeutic agent . Patients go receive second-line therapy represent select subgroup improve overall prognosis . Switch maintenance therapy pemetrexed erlotinib patient advance NSCLC without PD first-line chemotherapy confirm improve progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) significantly compare placebo two large randomize controlled study . However , continuation gemcitabine maintenance therapy set yield conflict result west , i.e.showing prolongation PFS without OS improvement . Thus , investigate efficacy safety continuation gemcitabine maintenance therapy patient metastatic NSCLC ECOG performance status 0-1 without PD four cycle first-line chemotherapy gemcitabine cisplatin China .</brief_summary>
