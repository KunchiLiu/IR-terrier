	<brief_summary>This phase I study conducted support clinical development program FDC product nucleoside analogue lamivudine nucleotide analogue adefovir dipivoxil . To establish bioequivalence , exposure lamivudine adefovir dipivoxil administer FDC compare Heptodin ( lamivudine ) Hepsera ( adefovir dipivoxil ) administer separately . In study , FDC product contain 100mg lamivudine/10mg adefovir dipivoxil . Total 40 healthy adult subject enrol . The study include screen visit two treatment session . The screen visit conduct 3 week prior first dose Session 1 . All subject receive Regimen A B accord randomization schedule . Eligible subject enrol study randomize receive follow treatment regimen table one follow treatment sequence : AB , BA . There seven ten day washout period treatment session . Pharmacokinetic sample measurement plasma lamivudine adefovir dipivoxil concentration conduct 48-hour period follow morning administration study medication study session . During time , subject remain unit pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample collection . The total duration ( screen end study ) subject 's participation approximately four week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) infection common , estimate global prevalence 400 million people , approximately 5 % world 's population . Chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) carrier evidence ongoing viral replication high risk development active liver inflammation ( i.e. , hepatitis B ) progressive liver disease . They also major contributor spread HBV infection . The goal therapy CHB include suppression HBV replication , reduction necroinflammatory process liver , prevention progression serious liver disease death . The HBV polymerase error rate intermediate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) herpes virus polymerase , ; predict patient CHB infection likely exhibit degree antiviral resistance nucleoside nucleotide monotherapies . Indeed , patient long-term lamivudine therapy find HBV variant ( YMDD variant ) reduce sensitivity lamivudine vitro , exhibit variably diminish therapeutic response . A fixed dose combination ( FDC ) formulation lamivudine adefovir dipivoxil treatment CHB . Lamivudine ( Heptodin ) active triphosphate ( 3TC-TP ) incorporate grow DNA chain result premature chain termination thereby inhibit HBV DNA synthesis . Adefovir dipivoxil ( Hepsera ) orally bioavailable pro-drug adefovir , nucleotide analog adenosine monophosphate . It inhibit reverse transcriptase DNA polymerase activity incorporate HBV DNA cause chain termination . A FDC would therefore combine establish benefit two important anti-HBV antiviral drug , represent first combination product treatment CHB . In addition enhance efficacy afford combination therapy , use combination product could enhance convenience compliance ensure patient receive two drug need . This study evaluate bioequivalence FDC containing ( lamivudine 100 mg/adefovir dipivoxil 10 mg ) compare Heptodin100 mg Hepsera 10 mg . This dose select Heptodin 100 mg Hepsera 10 mg approve PRC treatment CHB . Based extensive clinical experience use drug either monotherapy combination , anticipated co-administration agent FDC formulation well-tolerated .</detailed_description>
