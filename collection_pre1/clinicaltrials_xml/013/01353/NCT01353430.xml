	<brief_summary>The investigator research family inherit inclusion body myopathy ( IBM ) and/or Paget disease bone ( PDB ) and/or dementia ( FTD ) also call IBMPFD . IBMPFD cause mutation VCP gene . Our main goal understand change VCP gene cause muscle , bone cognitive problem associate disease . The investigator collect biological specimen blood urine sample , family medical history , questionnaire data patient personal family history VCP associate disease . Participants need symptom list order qualify . A select group participant may invite travel University California , Irvine two day program local procedure MRI bone scan . Samples cod maintain confidentiality . Travel necessary except family invite additional testing .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion include individual combination medical problem include muscle bone disease family member . Because historically VCP related muscle disease erroneously diagnose follow diagnosis , therefore patient also personal family history bone disease consider eligible study : Muscle disorder consider include : Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy Myopathy Inclusion body myopathy FSH ( Facioscapular muscular dystrophy ) without mutation Scapuloperoneal muscular dystrophy Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Non specific muscular dystrophy AND Bone disorder include : Paget disease bone Fibrous dysplasia Diaphyseal medullary stenosis malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( DMSMFH ) Nonspecific bone disease Eligible participant must also : Subjects must 18 year old Subjects must able give consent Adult family member spouses age 18 affected individual Under age 18 . Individuals report different unrelated diagnosis exclude study . Testing confirm different diagnosis perform , instead patient questioned information record obtain confirmation appropriate testing . Those unable provide consent exclude participate study .</criteria>
