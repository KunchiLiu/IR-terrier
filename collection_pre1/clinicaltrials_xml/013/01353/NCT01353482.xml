	<brief_summary>Mesothelioma relatively rare cancer become common . It affect one two areas; pleura ( line lung ) peritoneum ( line abdomen ) . Cancer affect pleura common call Pleural Mesothelioma . This commonly cause exposure asbestos . Unfortunately mesothelioma usually diagnose advanced stage treatment base around control disease manage symptom , rather cure disease . The standard treatment Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma combination two anticancer drugs; Pemetrexed Cisplatin . The trial look whether benefit add third drug call Vorinostat treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study First Line Vorinostat With Pemetrexed-cisplatin , Patients With Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mesothelioma rapidly lethal cancer increase incidence year year . A projected doubling case predict within next two decade Europe disease usually diagnose become advanced . As yet standard treatment advance mesothelioma , chemotherapy ( cytotoxic drug ) , disease control symptom management . A Phase I study drug call Vorinostat recently look effect , give standard cytotoxic drug , advance solid tumour . The data study show treatment cause response tumour patient mesothelioma . The study aim examine efficacy safety first-line vorinostat use concurrently cisplatin/pemetrexed . In proposed trial , initially conduct initial run-in phase I study , find maximum tolerated dose , embark randomise phase II trial . The study therefore two stage : Phase I study : find maximum tolerate dose vorinostat patient group . Both safety ( ie observe number Dose Limiting Toxicities per cohort overall toxicity profile ) number chemotherapy cycle administer used determine final dose vorinostat use subsequent phase II study . Randomised Phase II study : evaluate efficacy safety vorinostat ( use dose phase I study ) versus placebo combination cisplatin pemetrexed . The Phase II study use placebo double-blinding ensure neither patient research team aware allocate treatment , allow accurate comparison two treatment arm reduce potential researcher bias . Patients randomize 1:1 two treatment arm .</detailed_description>
