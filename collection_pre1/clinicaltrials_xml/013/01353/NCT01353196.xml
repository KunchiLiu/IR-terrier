	<brief_title>Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis : Cognitive Function Plaque Correlates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carotid artery stenosis well-known cause atheroembolic stroke . Stroke prevention patient focus intense investigation . Cognitive impairment insidious poorly understood outcome patient `` asymptomatic '' carotid stenosis suffer stroke . Cognitive function describes person produce control mental process think , learn , problem solving . It important outcome measure affect patient well-being ability live independent productive lie . It well-known cognitive impairment coexists patient stroke carotid stenosis . However , isolate cognitive deficit patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis look , therefore report detail . Asymptomatic carotid stenosis affect 2-12 % people . With 23.4 million Veterans country , least 1 million ( 4.3 % ) asymptomatic carotid stenosis risk cognitive impairment . A subset analysis Cardiovascular Health Study find cognitive decline 34 % 32 patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis . In proposal , investigator define extent initial progressive cognitive impairment Veterans carotid stenosis currently label `` asymptomatic '' absence focal neurologic deficit ( stroke , transient ischemic attack ) . Programs prevent , postpone , mitigate cognitive impairment patient carotid stenosis depend identification mediator cognitive impairment . Microembolic brain injury cerebral hypoperfusion associate cognitive impairment elderly individual . Therefore plaque architecture , plaque composition , microembolic count , serum inflammatory marker , cerebral hypoperfusion likely mediator impair cognition patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis . As part proposal , investigator identify biological mechanism carotid stenosis could result cognitive impairment . The goal proposal perform systematic , adequately power study measure magnitude cognitive impairment asymptomatic carotid stenosis , impact quality life , potential pathophysiological mechanism . Information study define unsuspected morbidity carotid stenosis identify subset patient risk cognitive impairment . It form foundation future study prevention , pre-emptive treatment , rehabilitation patient carotid stenosis . It also improve selection patient carotid stenosis decrease unnecessary revascularization procedure . Specific Aim 1 ass patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis differ cognitive function compare age-matched control without carotid stenosis similar vascular risk profile . The investigator hypothesize patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis 50 % survive stroke free 2 year ; change overall domain-specific cognitive function significantly different compare without stenosis . The study recruit 284 subject detect clinically significant difference cognitive score 90 % power . The investigator use novel battery cognitive test specifically develop address unique issue relate carotid stenosis . Specific Aim 2 define plaque-morphometric , biologic , hemodynamic characteristic correlate cognitive impairment patient asymptomatic carotid stenosis . The investigator hypothesize carotid plaque architecture , plaque composition , microembolic count , serum pro-inflammatory marker , cerebral hypoperfusion could mediate cognitive decline 2-year follow-up period . The investigator implement novel clinical 3D B-mode ultrasound imaging technique develop obtain reliable serial plaque measurement . Specific Aim 3 measure impact cognitive impairment quality life . The investigator hypothesize 2 year , regardless plaque feature , cognitive impairment correlate reduction health-related quality life measure .</detailed_description>
