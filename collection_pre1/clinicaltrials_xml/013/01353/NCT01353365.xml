	<brief_summary>Acute dyspnea chest discomfort common complaint . Distinguishing entity may present symptom difficult . This project aim study - venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) - difficult diagnosis easily miss yet treatment highly effective . VTE represent spectrum disease range deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . Early diagnosis PE usually base suspicion raise clinical symptom combine medical history obvious predisposing factor . However , around 30 % case PE occur absence predispose factor . Individual clinical sign symptoms neither sensitive specific . PE generally associate hypoxaemia , 20 % patient PE normal arterial oxygen pressure .Classic ECG change generally associate severe form PE . Bio-markers Plasma D-dimer ( DD ) investigate extensively recent year . It show normal DD level render acute PE DVT unlikely ; hand DD useful confirm VTE . CT angiography ( CTA ) become method choice image pulmonary vasculature suspect PE . Yet DD pre-test probability PE base clinician 's ability highly affect result CT . While VTE fairly common sometimes lethal condition diagnosis difficult base clinical hunch highly sensitive specific diagnostic tool . It 's quite evident find novel , sensitive even importantly specific biomarker PE would change current approach work-up need reach diagnosis . We propose use serum level surfactant associate protein ( SAP ) bio-marker . Surfactant unique phospholipoprotein secrete solely type II alveolar cell lung . About 90 % surfactant structure compose phospholipid remain 10 % compose specific protein . Working hypothesis aim : PE cause ischemic damage lung tissue . Such damage ultimately lead rise serum SPA . The primary objective project ascertain fact indeed rise serum SPA among patient diagnose PE , time-concentration profile rise rise correlate size embolus . Methods : The study design prospective study consist several step . The measurement serum SPA do commercially available ELISA kit . All patient enrol researcher ER internal B ward Rambam Medical Center . Probable implication Medicine : If indeed SPA level proven novel bio-marker PE could ultimately lead totally different approach classification treatment patient present sign may associate PE .</brief_summary>
