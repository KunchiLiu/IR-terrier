	<detailed_description>Systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) commonly find major surgery . Early detection SIRS lead early treatment . Serum cytokine level reliable marker SIRS detection high cost inconvenience . Clinical Scoring Systems commonly used assessment patient SIRS . If good correlation cytokine level , might use predict peri-operative clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
