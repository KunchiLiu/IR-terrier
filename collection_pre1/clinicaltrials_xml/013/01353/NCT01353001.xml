	<brief_title>Effect Weight Loss Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors Obese Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , research investigate obesity , inflammation , cardiovascular disease utilized lifestyle intervention focus weight loss exercise among group BMI classification normal , overweight mildly obese . A limitation recent investigation failure utilize participant significantly overweight . Those whose BMI classification extend Class II Class III obesity ( BMI &gt; 35.0 , BMI &gt; 40.0 ) yet study length , yet individual show able substantially improve cardiovascular risk profile without attain BMI 25 . Inactivity link increased adiposity trend toward high level cardiovascular disease risk . It necessary study relationship weight loss weight loss add physical activity among Class II Class III obese participant order gain thorough knowledge effect BMI circulate marker inflammation cardiac structural functional change associate weight loss among population . A second limitation current research use strictly progressive resistance training protocol . The protocol use increase constantly intensity volume , . Constant increase intensity tend lead overtraining among participant , highlight need variation intensity volume train protocol order avoid stagnation overtraining . Finally , research study specific impact diet resistance training either CRP cardiovascular adaptation .</detailed_description>
