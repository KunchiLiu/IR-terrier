	<brief_summary>Dolutegravir ( DTG , GSK1349572 ) integrase inhibitor develop treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -1 infection GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) behalf Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare LLC . DTG metabolize primarily uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase ( UGT ) 1A1 , minor role cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A , renal elimination unchanged drug extremely low ( &lt; 1 % dose ) . Fifty-three percent total oral dose excrete unchanged feces unknown part due unabsorbed drug percentage biliary excretion glucuronide conjugate degrade form parent compound gut lumen . The current Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) draft guidance renal impairment study state pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study patient renal impairment conduct even drug primarily metabolize secrete bile , renal impairment inhibit pathways hepatic gut drug metabolism transport . This study plan open label , single-dose , pharmacokinetic study evaluate plasma DTG pharmacokinetics follow oral administration subject severe renal impairment ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min ) match healthy control . Results study expected enable development appropriate dosing recommendation patient renal impairment .</brief_summary>

Pregnant female determine positive serum urine human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test screen prior dosing . Lactating female . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof , history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . If heparin use PK sample , subject history sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia enrol . Consumption red wine , seville orange , grapefruit grapefruit juice 7 day prior dose study medication . Subjects preexist condition interfere normal gastrointestinal anatomy motility , hepatic and/or renal function , could interfere absorption , metabolism , and/or excretion study drug .
