	<brief_summary>The disease-modifying treatment allergic disorder nowadays allergen-specific immunotherapy ( SIT ) . To induce hyporesponsiveness increase dos disease-eliciting allergen apply . One major problem treatment , combat already establish immune response disease-eliciting allergen . To circumvent problem investigator want perform proof principle study towards prophylactic treatment . Prophylactic vaccination use since many year many infectious disease . The investigator want adopt successful principle treatment type I allergy . For purpose non-allergic healthy individual immunize adjuvant-bound hypoallergenic derivative major birch pollen allergen , Bet v 1 . As usual allergen-specific immunotherapy , injection apply subcutaneously . Three injection one-monthly interval give establish immune response injection one year determine vaccine-induced immune response boost . The vaccine compose equimolar mixture two adjuvant-bound hypoallergenic derivative major birch pollen allergen , Bet v 1 . The first investigational product ( IP ) designate Bet v 1aF1 protein 73 amino acid residue represent first half ( 1-73aa ) Bet v 1 molecule . The second IP , Bet v 1aF2 , protein 86 amino acid residue represent second half ( 74-160aa ) Bet v 1 . Both protein express Escherichia coli . The hypoallergenic derivative lose IgE bind capacity disruption conformational IgE epitopes Bet v 1 molecule . In several preclinical clinical study show two hypoallergenic fragment , Bet v 1aF1 Bet v 1aF2 strongly reduce allergenic reactivity almost sensitization potential , requisite prophylactic treatment . In multi-centre placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial include 124 allergic patient relevant sensitization new epitope could observe vaccination Alum-bound Bet v 1 derivative . In contrast , vaccine induce strong IgG response animal well clinical study . Vaccine-induced antibody show protective property could inhibit bind allergic patient ' IgE . An improvement clinical symptom reduction skin reactivity correlate increase IgG antibody could show actively treated patient multi-centre placebo-controlled double blind clinical trial . The investigational product test Phase I clinical trial prophylactic allergy vaccination healthy non-allergic subject . The two IPs couple either Alum equimolar mixture inject subcutaneously . The immune response compare placebo . In total 20 non-allergic healthy male subject ( 10 per group ) include clinical trial . For safety precaution subject monitor skin prick test use two uncoupled IPs commercial birch pollen extract short interval recognize possible vaccine-induced sensitization . The primary endpoint phase I clinical trial evolution Bet v 1-specific Bet v 1 fragment-specific IgG1-4 , IgE IgM antibody level serum nasal fluid vaccination rBet v 1 derivative .</brief_summary>
