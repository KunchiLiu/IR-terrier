	<brief_summary>The purpose research study identify genetic , environmental immune profile may increase person 's risk develop multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . While MS disease cause single variation genetic material ( DNA ) , single environmental factor , single malfunction immune cell , genetic alteration , environmental exposure immunologic factor make development MS likely . Obtaining information risk MS beneficial future investigator identify effective way prevent slow progression disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MS autoimmune disease immune system ( white blood cell normally fight infection ) become misdirected attack healthy tissue . In patient MS , misdirect white blood cell attack myelin , line insulates nerve find brain spinal cord . This result inflammation damage myelin . Loss protective lining disrupts nerve impulse cause abnormal function nervous system . This large research study ultimately enroll 5000 subject risk develop MS .</detailed_description>
