	<brief_summary>Primary Research Questions : Efficacy , safety feasibility 3-month course levofloxacin pilot study assess . 1 . Under efficacy , pilot determine whether levofloxacin decrease incidence BK viruria peak urine BK viral load . 2 . Under safety , pilot determine incidence adverse event levofloxacin . 3 . Under feasibility , pilot determine number kidney transplant patient randomize eight month enrolment period , adherence levofloxacin frequency patient drop-out loss follow-up</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quinolone Prophylaxis Prevention BK Virus Infection Kidney Transplantation : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BK virus infection emerge major complication renal transplantation lead significant reduction graft survival . There currently proven strategy prevent treat BK virus infection . Quinolone antibiotic , levofloxacin , demonstrate activity BK virus . The investigator hypothesize administration quinolone antibiotic , give early post-transplantation , prevent establishment BK viral replication urine thus prevent systemic BK virus infection . A non-randomized study kidney transplant recipient find patient give levofloxacin ciprofloxacin significantly low incidence BK viremia compare receive quinolone ( 4 % versus 24.5 % , P=0.02 ) . Objective : The primary objective full trial determine quinolone levofloxacin decrease occurrence double creatinine , transplant failure death kidney transplant recipient . The aim pilot trial ass efficacy , safety feasibility 3-month course levofloxacin kidney transplant population . Results pilot study provide vital information design conduct large , multi-centre trial determine quinolone therapy decrease meaningful clinical outcome kidney transplantation . If levofloxacin significantly reduce BK viruria urine viral load kidney transplantation provide important justification biologic effect progress large trial . If full trial show levofloxacin significantly reduces BK infection improve outcomes , use renal transplantation strongly endorse give lack proven therapy condition .</detailed_description>
