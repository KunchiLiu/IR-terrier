	<brief_summary>Prevention myocardial functional deterioration sudden cardiac death among individual intermediate risk remain one elusive frontier contemporary medicine . While individual know contact medical system , frequently consider high risk far advance along one multiple disease process lead irreversible myocardial loss electric instability . The goal proposal determine prognostic power combine specific measure ventricular architecture , myocardial structure electrical function early identification individual risk develop ventricular arrhythmia progressive myocardial failure lead severe cardiovascular outcome death .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During C-TRIP Stage 1 refine risk stratification algorithm base electronic analysis 69,088 routine 12-lead ECGs perform large medical institution 6 month period combine previously establish index abnormal repolarization ( wide QRS-T angle ) validate measure myocardial damage ( Selvester QRS score ) . Among patient consider risk , 4.9 % perish 18 month later among survivor &gt; 70 year age LV ejection fraction ≤ 35 % , high risk die within 3 year cancer , end stage cardiac , pulmonary , renal , immunologic neurologic disease , exclude use simple reproducible screen arborescence base digital medical record . From pool remain risk patient derive application screen method three similarly large academic institution , sample 1100 individual recruit risk stratification participant C-TRIP Stage 2 prospective study . For C-TRIP Stage 2 , patient undergo detailed phenotypic study include contrast-enhanced cardiac MRI , ECG Holter record rest 6 minute walk , signal average ECG biomarkers inflammation , myocardial ischemia stress , well indices collagen synthesis turnover . Patients follow 3 year development combine clinical outcome include mortality ( cause , cardiac sudden cardiac death ) hospitalization non-fatal myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome , ventricular arrhythmias heart failure . From combination select phenotypic marker poor outcome , risk score develop use design prophylactic strategy aim curb premature sudden cardiac death end-stage cardiac disease among patient currently classify intermediate level risk .</detailed_description>
