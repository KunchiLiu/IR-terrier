	<brief_summary>AIDA Study prospective , multicentre , randomize , control clinical investigation patient undergo median laparotomy Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm ( AAA ) repair . The primary objective clinical investigation test hypothesis insertion Optilene® Mesh Elastic mesh - monofilament , light-weight , large pore size , polypropylene mesh manufacture Aesculap AG - superior suture alone reduce hernia formation rate within first 2 year .

	<brief_title>Prophylactic Mesh Implantation After Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One late complication elective surgery Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms ( AAA ) formation incisional hernia follow AAA repair . The high frequency incisional hernia formation AAA patient suggest presence structural defect within fascia . As result information obtain small pilot study use mesh prophylactically high risk group patient , concept use mesh prophylactically AAA repair seem area worth exploration . Owing availability new generation mesh proven good biocompatibility would seem could viable mean reduce herniation rate therefore re-operation high risk population . Within investigation Patients require elective surgical repair AAA randomize one follow three different group : - Group A : Monofilament absorbable MonoPlus® suture material use closing midline incision . - Group B : Abdominal wall closure monofilament absorbable MonoPlus® suture material onlay placement Optilene® Mesh Elastic fix suture . - Group C : Monofilament , absorbable MonoMax® suture material use closure abdominal cavity . A total 282 patient meet eligibility criterion enter clinical investigation ( Group A = 94 patient , Group B = 94 patient Group C = 94 patient ) . All patient follow-up clinical visit 2 day surgery , day discharge , 3 , 6 , 12 month final visit 24 month . All patient ask complete health status patient questionnaire EQ-5D preoperatively 3 , 6 , 12 24 month postoperatively . As patient routinely receive ultrasound 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month , information use confirm hernia present . The primary objective clinical investigation test hypothesis insertion Optilene® Mesh Elastic mesh superior suture alone reduce hernia formation rate within first 2 year . Secondary objective include : 1 . Lower herniation rate 12 month mesh implantation group B compare group A 2 . Non-inferiority MonoMax suture material ( group C ) comparison MonoPlus suture material ( group A ) concern rate incisional hernia abdominal wall closure 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month surgery . 3 . Mean time , day , return normal activity determine CRF question ( comparison group A , B , C ) . 4 . Mean time , day , return work determine CRF question ( comparison group A , B , C ) . 5 . Differences mean patient health status determine use patient questionnaire ( EQ-5D ) 3 , 6 , 12 24 month post-operatively ; pre-operative baseline record ( group A-C ) . 6 . Number wound complication ( group A-C ) determine medical assessment post-operatively immediately prior discharge , clinical visit 3 , 6 , 12 24 month , include infection , seromas , haematoma , hernia formation , confirm ultrasound examination . 7 . Safety determine collection adverse event CRF ( group A-C ) .</detailed_description>
