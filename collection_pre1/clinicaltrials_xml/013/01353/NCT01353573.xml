	<detailed_description>Radiosurgery perform use multiple Co-60 source , modify traditional gantry-based linear accelerator , robotic linear accelerator . Each technique advantage disadvantage . Co-60 radiosurgery precise target localization use rigid immobilization device . The requirement rigid immobilization limit treatment head neck . Robotic radiosurgery permit precise radiation deliver without requirement rigid immobilization . Robotic radiosurgery use real-time imagining , allow track cancer internal structure move treatment . Another advantage deliver many small beam radiation ( many 200 ) limit time period treat lesion anywhere body . A traditional gantry-based linear accelerator normally require form immobilization require time multiple isocentre set provide radiosurgery conventional treatment . Brain metastases occur 50 % patient cancer . It report 65 % patient brain metastasis present one three lesion . This represent 18,000 patient Ontario year would eligible radiosurgery part management . Randomized trial demonstrate improved palliation overall survival radiosurgery add conventional whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) . As result treatment brain metastasis currently represent large resource use radiosurgery . During commission initial use first robotic radiosurgery device Ontario ( CyberKnife ) investigator become aware potential advantage treatment brain metastasis . Treatment planning time treatment time robotic radiosurgery appear well traditional linear accelerator patient appear comfortable minimal/ non-invasive immobilization require . Surprisingly , little direct comparison robotic radiosurgery technique literature one prospective randomize trial compare two different approach deliver Co-60 radiosurgery identify . Given increase importance radiosurgery resource implication radiation treatment program Ontario , study propose conduct direct comparison robotic traditional linear accelerator radiosurgery brain metastasis . The primary outcome treatment plan delivery time important secondary outcome patient comfort . Treatment planning time include immobilization preparation , CT simulation , image fusion , radiation planning treatment plan quality assurance . Treatment delivery time include patient set , target localization treatment delivery . The Juravinski Cancer Centre ( JCC ) McMaster University uniquely pose perform comparison access robotic linear accelerator radiosurgery techniques well research methodology expertise clinical trial technology assessment , health service research .</detailed_description>
