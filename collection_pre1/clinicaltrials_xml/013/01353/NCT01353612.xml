Following informed consent , patient undergo baseline coronary intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) image non-invasive ultrasound image carotid artery . Following 2-year follow-up period , patient undergo repeat coronary IVUS standard invasive coronary angiography well carotid ultrasound examination . Additionally , patient contact phone annual basis 5 year collect cardiovascular cerebrovascular clinical endpoint . Evaluations plaque burden make use invasive non invasive imaging tool order ass correlation vascular bed , image technology main cardiovascular event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CTA PET Substudy : A subset patient enrol main CAIN3 study undergo CTA . At site CTA PET image modality exist , patient ask undergo test . The CTA PET scan do separately 2 image bed different day perform image bed , result combine CTA PET scan do one schedule visit . All image do within 90 day follow IVUS . The choice radiotracer use ( NaF FDG ) PET image dependent upon site availability day scan . A total 120 patient enrol substudy approximately 50-60 undergoing CTA PET .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient age 18 year . Patients schedule clinically indicated coronary angiography possible ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) evaluate scheduled procedure . Written informed consent ( approved Institutional Review Board [ IRB ] /Independent Ethics Committee [ IEC ] ) obtain prior study specific procedure . Patients consider stable enrollment ( discretion investigator ) eligible provide meet entry criterion . Angiogram meeting qualify criterion Women childbearing potential ( woman surgically sterile postmenopausal define amenorrhea &gt; 12 month ) refuse undergo urine serum pregnancy test immediately prior baseline repeat image evaluation The urine serum pregnancy test must negative prior image evaluation . Previous coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery probable need CABG next 24 month . Patients symptomatic congestive heart failure ( CHF ) ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Class III IV ) baseline . Patients clinically significant valvular heart disease likely require surgical repair replacement treatment period study Any clinically significant medical condition presence laboratory abnormality consider investigator clinically important could interfere conduct study . The presence severe liver disease define presence cirrhosis , chronic active hepatitis , chronic jaundice hyperbilirubinemia , Patients eGFR &lt; 45 ml/min prior baseline imaging procedure , nephrotic syndrome Patients life expectancy le 2 year . History malignancy ( except curatively treat basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin ) 3 year prior screen . Unable unwilling comply protocol requirement , deem investigator unfit study .</criteria>
