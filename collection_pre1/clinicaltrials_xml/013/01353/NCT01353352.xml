	<brief_summary>Neck injury common problem among blunt trauma victim 8,000,000 case see annually U.S. Canadian EDs . While majority case represent soft tissue injury , 30,000 patient suffer cervical spine fracture dislocation approximately 10,000 suffer spinal cord injury . There readily available national Canadian data ED visit provide U.S. National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey . The prevalence potential neck injury , however , reasonably estimate Canadian EDs . Extrapolation , population basis , reliable U.S. figure suggest 1.3 million potential neck injury patient see annually Canada . Only 0.9 % patient find cervical spine fracture dislocation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Nursing C-Spine ( Phase IV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Canadian emergency department ( EDs ) annually treat 1.3 million patient suffered blunt trauma fall motor vehicle collision risk cervical spine injury . Most case alert stable adult le 1 % c-spine fracture . Most trauma victim transport ambulance protect backboard , collar , sandbag , arrival ED , send high acuity resuscitation room , remain fully immobilize hour physician assessment radiography complete . This prolonged immobilization often unnecessary add considerably patient discomfort also add burden overcrowd Canadian EDs era unprecedented pressure . These patient use valuable ED resuscitation room space . Nurses usually evaluate c-spine trauma patient investigator believe able safely assess alert stable ambulance patient `` clear '' c-spine low-risk case arrival triage station . Patients could much rapidly , comfortably , efficiently manage area ED . An expanded role nurse decision-making potential improve trauma care efficiency Canadian hospital . Very little research do area nurse ' clear patient c-spines . A clinical decision rule derive original research define decision make tool incorporates three variable history , examination , simple test . This Canadian C-Spine Rule ( CCR ) comprise simple clinical variable design allow clinician `` clear '' c-spine without radiography decrease immobilization time . The investigator also validate accuracy rule use physician . The investigator finish funded study validate accuracy reliability CCR use ED triage nurse 6 hospital . The investigator complete funded implementation trial 12 Canadian hospital evaluate impact patient CCR use physician . Objectives : The goal phase IV Canadian C-Spine Rule project evaluate safety potential impact active strategy empower ED triage nurse evaluate clear c-spine low-risk trauma patient . Specific objective : 1 ) Determine safety screening : ) Missed fracture b ) Serious adverse outcome ; 2 ) Determine clinical impact measuring : ) C-spine clearance rate nurse , b ) Length time c-spine clearance ; 3 ) Evaluate performance Canadian C-Spine Rule : ) Accuracy , b ) Nurse accuracy interpretation , c ) Nurse comfort compliance . Methods : The investigator propose cohort study evaluate outcomes 12-month period 5 hospital EDs , include 3 community 2 teaching hospital site . Enrolled consecutive , alert stable adult trauma patient present ED neck pain c-spine immobilization ambulance stretcher . Participating ED triage nurse previously underwent structured educational strategy learn CCR successfully participate 24-month phase IIb validation study site . These nurse empower medical directive `` clear '' c-spine patient accord CCR , thus allow remove c-spine immobilization triage patient less acute area ED . These outcome assess : 1 ) Measures safety : ) Number miss fracture , b ) Number serious adverse outcome ; 2 ) Measures clinical impact : ) C-spine clearance rate nurse , b ) Length stay ED , c ) Patient satisfaction ; 3 ) Performance Canadian C-Spine Rule : ) Accuracy , b ) Nurse accuracy interpretation , c ) Nurse comfort . The investigator estimate sample size 1,500 patient accrue . Importance : This evaluation study ( phase IV ) essential step process develop new clinical decision rule / guideline nurse clear c-spine . Once investigator establish safety potential impact phase IV , investigator move final step ( phase V ) , multicenter implementation across Canada study actual impact . The investigator believe teach ED triage nurse clear c-spine low-risk trauma patient potential significantly improve efficiency comfort patient care busy Canadian EDs . Ultimately , investigator expect result study use ED triage nurse throughout Canada .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The investigator enroll consecutive alert , stable adult present study hospital EDs potential cspine injury sustain acute blunt trauma . These patient present neck pain cspine immobilization ambulance stretcher . Patient eligibility determine base criterion time arrival ED . `` Potential cspine injury sustain acute blunt trauma '' include patient either : ) neck pain mechanism injury ( subjective complaint patient pain posterior aspect neck ) , and/or ii ) presentation ambulance cspine immobilization injury ( typically backboard collar ) . `` Alert '' define Glasgow Coma Scale103 score 15 ( converse , fully orient , follow command ) . `` Stable '' refers normal vital sign define Revised Trauma Score31 ( systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg great respiratory rate 10 24 breath per minute ) . `` Acute '' refers injury within past 48 hour . Patients age 16 year , Patients satisfy definition `` potential cspine injury '' define ( example , patient neither neck pain arrive ambulance cspine immobilization exclude ) , Patients Glasgow Coma Scale score less 15 , Patients unstable vital sign ( systolic BP &lt; 90 ; respiratory rate le 10 24 ) , Patients whose injury occur 48 hour previously , Patients penetrate trauma stab gunshot wound , Patients acute paralysis ( paraplegia , quadriplegia ) , Patients know vertebral disease ( ankylose spondylitis , rheumatoid arthritis , spinal stenosis , previous cervical spine surgery ) , Patients return reassessment injury , Patients refer another hospital .</criteria>
