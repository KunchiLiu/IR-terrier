	<brief_title>REVOLUTION ( WFCC-133 ) - Treatment Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include Workflow Phase verify consistent workflow study device component evaluate acute safety . Upon meeting define criterion , Workflow Phase close enrollment toward Main Study Phase include roll-in ( first 3 subject enrol site follow closure Workflow Phase ) Subpopulation Neurological Assessments ( SNA ) substudy subject . SNA assessment prospective , non-randomized , control , acute assessment two ablation device determine intracerebral microemboli generate immediately radiofrequency ablation therapy PAF . SNA subject remain complete Main Study Phase . However , SNA-control subject consider part Main Study Phase . All subject , include subject enrol Workflow Phase include Safety Cohort ( evaluate Primary Safety endpoint Secondary Safety endpoint ) .</detailed_description>
