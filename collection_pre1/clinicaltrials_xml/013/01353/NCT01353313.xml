	<brief_summary>The Hydrocortisone Extubation study test safety efficacy 10 day course hydrocortisone infants less 30 week estimate gestational age intubate 14-28 day life . Infants randomize receive hydrocortisone placebo . This study determine hydrocortisone improve infants'survival without moderate severe BPD associate improvement survival without moderate severe neurodevelopmental impairment 22 - 26 month correct age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) remain leading morbidity extremely preterm infant , prolong mechanical ventilation associate increased risk BPD . Dexamethasone use previously facilitate extubation decrease incidence BPD ; however , due adverse effect neurodevelopmental outcome , use drug decrease . One cohort study suggest hydrocortisone ( HC ) may facilitate extubation . HC thus far associated adverse neurodevelopmental outcome either cohort study randomize controlled trial . A recent meta-analysis postnatal corticosteroid therapy begin first week life suggest `` late therapy may reduce neonatal mortality without significantly increase risk adverse long-term neurodevelopmental outcome , '' although methodological quality follow-up acknowledge limited . This randomize control trial study efficacy safety 10-day taper course hydrocortisone treatment infant &lt; 30 week estimate gestational age birth remain intubated 14 - 28 day postnatal age . Based previous Network data criterion define population risk death BPD 36 week postmenstrual age approximately 65 - 75 % . The primary outcome study incorporate ( 1 ) survival without moderate severe BPD Network physiologic definition ( 2 ) survival without moderate severe NDI 18 - 22 month correct age . Therefore , result study report follow-up data available unless ( 1 ) trial stop early DSMC strong evidence benefit harm , ( 2 ) time subject complete treatment DCC find substantial survival benefit favor hydrocortisone ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . Individual study assignment remain masked follow-up complete . Secondary outcome include short term measure respiratory morbidity growth 36 week postmenstrual age long term measure include growth outcomes 22 - 26 month correct age . Secondary study include : 1 ) Effect Hydrocortisone Cardiac mass Premature Intubated Infants - determine leave ventricular mass index 36 week postmenstrual age ( prior discharge/transfer 34 week ) infant enrol hydrocortisone BPD RCT , compare HC-treated infant placebo-treated infant . It similarly assess compare incidence pulmonary hypertension patient . .</detailed_description>
