	<brief_summary>Age Related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause blindness North America . This condition cause progressive loss central vision , part vision allow read , drive see image sharp detail directly front . The wet form AMD characterize growth leakage small blood vessel choroid layer eye , back eye . These leak blood vessel disrupt structure function eye , cause loss vision , particularly sharp vision create macula area eye . Currently , best treatment wet AMD series injection anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) drug , ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) . The clinical response treatment vary . Approximately 70 % patient see moderate vision gain ( 3-line gain visual acuity chart ) , 30 % see similar improvement vision . There way identify patient respond significant vision gain versus experience moderate vision gain . Recent research AMD demonstrate genetic mutation prove key risk factor patient develop wet AMD , 80 % wet AMD case explain inherited genetic variation . Scientists theorize may genetic difference patient see significant response treatment . The investigator test participant 's genetic profile use Macula Risk test follow progress standard treatment wet AMD course study . This study aim demonstrate association know genetic variation patient response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Your ophthalmologist determine suitability study screen protocol . You measurements visual acuity undergo series image test describe next paragraph show presence blood vessel growth back eye ( choroid ) . You include study another significant eye disease affect vision , blood vessel growth back eye ( choroid ) reason AMD , medically uncontrolled glaucoma , treat AMD past , intra-ocular surgery study eye past 3 month , past retinal vitreous surgery , physical mental disability would prevent accurate vision test . At begin study , take sample cell inside cheek , use small swab . The sample send genetic laboratory analysis storage . This information keep masked duration study , meaning , study ophthalmologist data analyzer know result genetic test study complete . You ask come initial assessment determine start visual ability medical history . On next appointment , receive first treatment intra-vitreal injection Ranibizumab ( Lucentis ) . You ask come clinic every month six ( 6 ) month total treatment injection test . At appointment , take 3-D image retina ( back eye ) use Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) image device , test eye pressure determine sign infection inflammation injection . On month 1 , 3 , 6 also test vision , contrast sensitivity use standard contrast sensitivity chart ( The Pelli-Robson chart ) take image blood vessel growth use colour dye ( fluorescein ) help u see vessel . Before every treatment , anesthetic eye drop ( proparacaine ) apply eye feel injection . You give antibiotic eye drop ( ZymarÂ® ) ask use 4 time day day injection prevent infection .</detailed_description>
