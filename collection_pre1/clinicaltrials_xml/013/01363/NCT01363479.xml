	<criteria>Naïve cytotoxic chemotherapy . Previous biological hormonal therapy permit . Diagnosed malignant solid tumor schedule receive first course cytotoxic chemotherapy cisplatin administer single I.V . dose equal 70 mg/m2 14 hour study Day 1 , either alone combination chemotherapeutic agent . If schedule receive combination regimen , noncisplatin agent moderate high emetogenic potential allow must administer follow cisplatin infusion complete 6 hour initiation cisplatin infusion . If schedule receive chemotherapy agent minimal low emetogenic potential , give Day 1 follow cisplatin subsequent study day . ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 Female patient either nonchildbearing potential childbearing potential commitment use contraceptive method throughout clinical trial Hematologic metabolic status adequate receiving highly emetogenic cisplatinbased regimen base laboratory criterion ( Neutrophils , Platelets , Bilirubin , Liver enzymes , Serum Creatinine Creatinine Clearance ) If patient know hepatic renal impairment , he/she may enrol study discretion Investigator . If patient know history predisposition cardiac conduction interval abnormality he/she may enrol study discretion Investigator . If female , pregnant lactating . Current use illicit drug current evidence alcohol abuse . Scheduled receive moderately emetogenic chemotherapy ( MEC ) HEC Day 2 Day 5 follow cisplatin administration . Received schedule receive radiation therapy abdomen , pelvis within 1 week prior Day 1 Days 1 5 . Any vomiting , retch , mild nausea within 24 hour prior Day 1 . Symptomatic primary metastatic CNS malignancy . Active peptic ulcer disease , gastrointestinal obstruction , increase intracranial pressure , hypercalcemia , active infection uncontrolled medical condition ( malignancy ) , opinion investigator , may confound result study , represent another potential etiology emesis nausea ( chemotherapyinduced nausea vomiting , CINV ) pose unwarranted risk administer study drug patient . Known hypersensitivity contraindication 5HT3 receptor antagonist ( e.g. , palonosetron , ondansetron , granisetron , dolasetron , tropisetron , ramosetron ) dexamethasone . Participation clinical trial involve palonosetron . Any investigational drug ( give study ) take within 4 week prior Day 1 , and/or schedule receive investigational drug study . Systemic corticosteroid therapy dose within 72 hour prior Day 1 . However topical inhaled corticosteroid steroid dose £ 10 mg prednisone daily equivalent permit . Scheduled receive bone marrow transplantation and/or stem cell rescue therapy . Any medication know potential antiemetic activity within 24 hour prior Day 1</criteria>
