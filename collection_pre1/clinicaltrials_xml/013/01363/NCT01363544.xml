	<brief_summary>Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) developmental disorder severe impact child 's life society . The core symptom attention problem , hyperactivity impulsivity . These symptom relate disruption neurocognitive function ( inhibition : ability stop behavior ) disruption cortical regulation ( 'cortical underarousal ' measure electroencephalogram ) . To date , evidence-based treatment pharmacological . Medication effective 20-30 % child ADHD side effect . The lack alternative medication severe problem child society . Neurofeedback become increasingly popular treat ADHD . Neurofeedback train person learns alter cortical regulation . Neurofeedback classify 'probably effective ' treatment effect need empirical evidence . Non specific training effect , individual attention , may also contribute treatment success . In research project investigator compare efficacy neurofeedback exercise , second non-pharmacological treatment , may comparable neurofeedback term non-specific effect . Exercise also promise treatment positive effect behavior , neurocognition several patient group . For reason , exercise deserve systematic research ADHD . Furthermore , investigator compare efficacy two treatment optimal pharmacological treatment methylphenidate ( MPH ) . The main question neurofeedback exercise comparable efficacy MPH treat ADHD . The primary outcome measure behaviour ( symptoms ADHD ) . Secondary outcome measure include neurocognition cortical regulation . This research project give answer question neurofeedback exercise effective MPH . Furthermore , give insight intervention give rise improvement behavior .</brief_summary>
