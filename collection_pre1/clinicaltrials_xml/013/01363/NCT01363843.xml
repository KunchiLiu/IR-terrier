	<brief_summary>The purpose study find well patient cancer rectum get treatment - chemotherapy follow chemotherapy radiation together - surgery . Patients recently diagnose rectal cancer , doctor recommend neo-adjuvant chemo treatment try shrink cancer removing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Complete Neoadjuvant Treatment REctal Cancer ( CONTRE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal treatment locally advanced ( T3-4 N1-2 ) rectal cancer eliminate primary tumor involve adjacent lymph node , minimize risk distant recurrence , , possible , preserve anal sphincter function . Standard treatment consist surgery , concurrent chemotherapy radiation ( RT ) adjuvant chemotherapy . As present time , chemoradiation portion treatment often administer , oppose following , surgical resection . This approach associate tumor down-staging , lead high rate tumor resectability increase ability perform sphincter-saving surgery . ( 1 ) . However , advance treatment primary tumor regional node , specifically administration preoperative chemoradiation aggressive surgical approach , total mesorectal excision ( TME ) , show improve locoregional disease control , toxicity complication treatment may result delay omission adjuvant chemotherapy , could increase risk distant recurrence . In pilot study , standard adjuvant chemotherapy ( 8 cycle modify FOLFOX6 ) administer prior chemoradiation definitive surgery , eliminate need post-operative systemic therapy . The investigator evaluate ability patient tolerate treatment impact achievement pathologic complete response ( pCRs ) , negative surgical margin sphincter preservation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients must histologically prove adenocarcinoma rectum evidence distant metastasis . The tumor must clinically Stage II ( T34 N0 N0 define imaged lymph node &lt; 1.0cm ) III ( T14 N12 definition clinically positive node node &gt; 1.0cm ) . Stage tumor may determine CT scan , endorectal ultrasound MRI . Patients must evidence distant metastasis include liver metastasis , peritoneal seeding , inguinal lymphadenopathy . Patients must receive prior chemotherapy pelvic radiation rectal cancer , prior pelvic radiation malignancy would prevent patient receiving require radiation treatment study . Patients must life expectancy 5 year , exclude diagnosis cancer ( determine investigator ) . Patients must active concurrent invasive malignancy . Patients prior malignancy , include invasive colon cancer , eligible deem physician low risk recurrence . Patients squamous basal cell carcinoma skin , melanoma situ , carcinoma cervix , carcinoma situ colon rectum effectively treat eligible , even condition diagnose within 5 year prior randomization . Patients must &gt; 18 year age , ECOG performance status 01 . ANC &gt; 1,500/µl , platelet &gt; 100,000/µl , total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl direct bilirubin &lt; 1.0 mg/dl , alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3xULN , ALT &lt; 3xULN , creatinine &lt; 1.5xULN . The patient must evaluate surgeon , radiation oncologist medical oncologist must concur patient appropriate study . Signed informed consent ; able comply study and/or follow procedure Peripheral neuropathy &lt; grade 1 Evidence metastatic disease . Rectal cancer adenocarcinoma , i.e. , sarcoma , lymphoma , carcinoid , squamous cell carcinoma , cloacogenic carcinoma , etc . Pregnancy lactation time propose randomization . Eligible patient reproductive potential ( sex ) must agree use adequate contraception . Any therapy cancer prior randomization . Synchronous invasive colon cancer . Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would preclude patient receive chemotherapy treatment option would prevent require followup . Patients active inflammatory bowel disease , abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior Day 0 serious medical illness might limit ability patient receive protocol therapy . Prior pelvic irradiation indication . Known hypersensitivity 5fluorouracil oxaliplatin Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement .</criteria>
