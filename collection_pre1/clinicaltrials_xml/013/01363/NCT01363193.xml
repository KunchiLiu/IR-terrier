	<brief_summary>Standard weight-based IV heparin normal weight patient base actual body weight ( ABW ) . However , well-defined guideline establish patient consider obese morbidly obese . In current practice , calculate ABW base heparin initial bolus dose infusion rate quite high , therefore often use obese/morbidly obese patient fear bleed . Heparin distribute body approximately blood get distribute adipose tissue . There study suggest lean body weight ( LBW ) might good basis dose heparin . LBW calculate weight excludes weight fat . The investigator hypothesize intravenous heparin dose base Lean body weight obese/morbidly obese patient would safe effective achieve therapeutic level heparin 24 hour compare usual practice patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Unfractionated Heparin use anticoagulant various disease state condition , atrial fibrillation , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , myocardial infarction , acute coronary syndrome , peripheral vascular disease . Prior study demonstrate weight-based heparin ( WBH ) dose regimen superior fix dose regimen ( e.g . 5000 unit bolus 1000 units/hour ) achieve therapeutic activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) quickly few complication ( 1,2 ) . The importance achieve anticoagulation target aPTT range within 24 hour start intravenous heparin infusion demonstrate therapeutic benefit ( 1,3,30-31 ) . WBH dose standard care intravenous heparin therapy . Prior study assess benefit WBH utilize patient ' actual body weight ( ABW ) , significantly consider issue dose titrate WBH obese morbidly obese ( O/MO ) patient population ( 1,16-17 , 32 ) . There study examine effect obesity heparin dosing , wide variation obesity define ( ) WBH nomogram base ABW adjust patient population ( 4,12,16-18 , 23 , 25 ) . In addition , case report address WBH-dosing O/MO patient population accord modern definition obesity . These limitation make difficult apply clinical setting ( 16-18 , 21-28 ) . In current practice , ABW-based heparin bolus dose infusion rate quite high therefore often used O/MO patient due fear over-anticoagulation serious bleeding . Studies fact report high potential supratherapeutic aPTT bariatrically-challenged population ( 19 , 23-24 , 26-27 ) . Therefore , remain uncertain optimize intravenous heparin dose patient . The volume distribution ( Vd ) heparin similar blood volume adipose tissue little vasculature account heparin 's distribution ( 5-11 ) . LBW recently propose good metric dose heparin obese/morbidly obese patient ( 14-15,20,29,34 ) . The investigator hypothesize intravenous heparin ( IVH ) dose base LBW O/MO patient would safe effective achieve aPTT within 24 hour compare usual practice patient population . In addition , investigator postulate would cost-effective since would reduce number blood draws laboratory test ( 13 ) . This prospective study involve department emergency medicine , internal medicine ( section cardiology critical care ) , laboratory , nursing , pharmacy . Those patient O/MO accord 2004 World Health Organization ( WHO ) definition ( BMI &gt; 30 ) ( 33 ) IVH order enrol receive heparin via LBW-based nomogram . As comparison , investigator also calculate initial bolus infusion dos would give traditional ABW-based treatment algorithm . A signed consent form patient obtain order use LBW-based heparin nomogram . In accordance standard weight-based heparin protocol 2008 CHEST guideline , modify version current Mercy Nazareth Hospital ( MNH ) weight-based heparin protocol follow aspect beyond dose nomogram . An aPTT tracking form data collection tool utilized monitor gather result . References File - provide upon request .</detailed_description>
