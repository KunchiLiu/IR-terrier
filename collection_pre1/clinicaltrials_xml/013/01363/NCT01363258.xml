	<brief_title>Reducing Care-Resistant Behaviors During Oral Hygiene Persons With Dementia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nursing home ( NH ) resident dementia often dependent others mouth care , yet react care-resistant behavior ( CRB ) receive assistance . The oral health elder deteriorate absence daily oral hygiene , predispose harmful systemic problem pneumonia , hyperglycemia , cardiac disease , cerebral vascular accident . The purpose study determine whether CRBs reduce , oral health improve , application intervention base neurobiological principle threat perception fear response . When faced threat , organisms react `` flight-fight '' response . These response autonomic ( e.g . elevated heart rate , sweat ) behavioral ( e.g . move away , attack ) . Persons dementia heighten threat perception result neurobiological change affect cerebral cortex , hippocampus , amygdala . These individual may interpret mouth care threaten action threaten people . The intervention , call Managing Oral Hygiene Using Threat Reduction ( MOUTh ) , combine best mouth care practice constellation behavioral technique reduce threat perception thereby prevent de-escalate CRB . The primary specific aim study : 1 ) Evaluate efficacy MOUTh intervention reduce CRBs person dementia ; 2 ) Validate overall efficacy MOUTh intervention use nurse-sensitive oral health outcome -- swell bleeding gum , cleanliness oral cavity , saliva , integrity lip oral mucosa ; 3 ) Calculate cost MOUTh intervention . Using randomized repeated measure design , 80 elder dementia 5 different NHs randomize individual level experimental group , receive intervention , control group , receive standard mouth care research team member receive train proper method provide mouth care train resistance recognition prevention/mediation . Oral health assessment CRB measurement obtain 7-day observation period 21-day intervention period . Individual growth model use multilevel analysis use estimate efficacy intervention reduce CRBs person dementia , estimate overall efficacy intervention use oral health outcome . Activity-based cost method use determine cost MOUTh intervention . At end study , research team anticipate prove intervention prevents reduce CRB within context mouth care . Long-term objective include test effect intervention systemic illness among person dementia ; examine transferability intervention activity daily live ; disseminate threat reduction intervention NH staff , may radically change way care provide person dementia .</detailed_description>
