	<brief_title>Hyper CVAD Plus Ofatumumab CD - 20 Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug : Ofatumumab design bind surface type white blood cell . This may cause cancer cell come white blood cell die . Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) : If find eligible take part study , receive CVC already one . A CVC sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . Study Plan : During Cycles 1-8 , receive ofatumumab Cycles 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 . During Cycles 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , also receive cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , dexamethasone ( hyper-CVAD ) . During Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , also receive methotrexate cytarabine . After Cycles 1-8 , receive 30 cycle Maintenance therapy . During Maintenance : - During Cycles 1-5 , 8-17 , 20-30 , receive 6-mercaptopurine , methotrexate , vincristine , prednisone . - During Cycles 6 18 ( Cycles 7 19 ) , receive cyclophosphamide , vincristine , doxorubicin , dexamethasone , ofatumumab . - During Cycles 7 19 ( Cycles 6 18 ) , receive methotrexate pegaspargase . First Phase Treatment ( Cycles 1-8 ) : Every 21 day study cycle . You receive ofatumumab vein 4-6 hour Days 1 11 Cycles 1 3 Days 1 8 Cycles 2 4 . During Cycles 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , also receive follow drug : - On Days 1-3 , receive cyclophosphamide 2 time day vein 3 hour . - On Days 1-3 , receive mesna vein non-stop 3 day . The mesna infusion end 12 hour last dose cyclophosphamide . - On Day 4 , receive doxorubicin vein non-stop 1 day CVC . - On Day 4 , receive vincristine vein 15 minute . - On Days 1-4 11-14 , receive dexamethasone 1 time day vein 30 minute mouth . During Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , also receive follow drug : - On Day 1 , receive methotrexate vein 24 hour . If doctor think need help reduce risk side effect , may receive leucovorin vein 4 time day 8 dos , begin 12 hour Day 1 methotrexate dose end . - On Days 2 3 , receive cytarabine vein 2 time day 2 hour . You may receive filgrastim pegfilgrastim end every cycle help raise blood cell count finish chemotherapy . If receive filgrastim , give needle skin . If receive pegfilgrastim , give needle skin . You may give drug help prevent side effect . The study staff tell drug , give , possible risk . If previously untreated cancer , receive follow drug Cycles 1-4 , Cycles 1-8 Burkitt 's Leukemia/Lymphoma , help prevent disease brain spinal fluid : - On Day 2 , receive methotrexate injection spinal canal ( space surround spinal cord ) . - On Day 7 , receive cytarabine injection spinal canal . If mediastinal lymphoblastic lymphoma bulky mediastinal disease mediastinal lymphadenopathy ( enlarged lymph node chest area ) , may radiation therapy chest area base status disease . The radiation therapy give recover Cycle 8 start Maintenance therapy . Your doctor explain radiation therapy detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . Maintenance Therapy : During Maintenance Cycles 1-5 , 8-17 , 20-30 : - You take 6-mercaptopurine mouth 3 time daily . - On Day 1 , receive vincristine vein 15 minute . - You take methotrexate mouth weekly . - On Days 1-5 , take prednisone mouth . During Maintenance Cycles 6 18 ( Cycles 7 19 ) , receive drug schedule Cycles 1 3 . During Maintenance Cycles 7 19 ( Cycles 6 18 ) : - You receive methotrexate Day 1 vein 2 hour . - You receive pegaspargase Day 2 vein 2 hour . If Burkitt Leukemia/Lymphoma , receive induction , consolidation intrathecal chemotherapy ( injected spinal canal ) . You receive maintenance therapy . Study Visits : You physical exam cycle . One ( 1 ) time week Cycles 1-8 , 1 time month Maintenance , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 14 Cycle 1 , 1 time week , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease . If cancer go remission ( sign disease ) bone marrow aspirations/biopsies perform every 4 month . You chest x-ray PET/CT scan anytime doctor think need . Length Study : You may receive 38 cycle study drug . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Follow-Up : You follow side effect 30 day last dose study drug . You blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) drawn . Long-Term Follow-Up : The study staff call every 3 month 1 year finish receiving study drug . During call , ask feeling side effect may drug may take . This investigational study . Ofatumumab FDA approve commercially available treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Its use treat ALL investigational . Up 80 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
