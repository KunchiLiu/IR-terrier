	<brief_summary>To date , approve treatment vascular cognitive impairment ( VCI ) main therapeutic effort aim control vascular risk factor counter VCI development progression . Several study report cholinergic deficit brain cerebrospinal fluid patient VCI . The effect choline alphoscerate clinical study Alzheimer 's disease VCI improve memory attention impairment . The purpose study determine effectiveness choline alphoscerate v placebo improve cognition post-stroke patient VCI-non dementia ( VCI-ND ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Impaired brain cholinergic neurotransmission key role deterioration cognitive function Alzheimer 's disease vascular cognitive impairment ( VCI ) . These deficit , although different degree find Alzheimer 's disease , suggest associate VCI.To date , approve treatment vascular dementia ( VaD ) main therapeutic effort field aim control vascular risk factor counter VaD development progression . There also several trial cholinesterase inhibitor treatment VCI . Available data suggest evidence benefit cholinesterase inhibitor subcortical vascular dementia vascular cognitive impairment . Treated patient modest benefit cognition , attention , executive function ability perform instrumental activity daily live , effect limit due small number subject examine complex establish clinical relevance effect . The majority clinical study available effect choline alphoscerate neurodegenerative cerebrovascular disorder review . A comparison Alzheimer 's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale ( ADAS-Cog ) analysis result obtain item 4 trial cholinesterase inhibitor reveal positive trend cholinergic precursor choline alphoscerate cholinesterase inhibitor .</detailed_description>
