	<brief_summary>Excessive repetitive load concentrate upon plantar fascia consider influential factor plantar fasciitis development . Abnormal foot structure may lead high risk plantar fasciitis . However , biomechanical factor may cause plantar fasciitis thoroughly investigate . Orthotic device common treatment use plantar fasciitis . However , direct quantitative data , stress strain distribution plantar fascia patient foot orthosis gait . Therefore , aim three-year project study investigate biomechanical mechanism different foot structure understand biomechanical response plantar fascia stance phase gait cycle dynamic finite element analysis , gait analysis well plantar pressure measurement . In addition , efficacy foot orthoses evaluate research process . The hypothesis flat foot high arch foot may result high stress strain upon plantar fascia gait ; foot orthosis , total contact insole , carbon fiber plate rocker bottom sole , would reduce stress strain distribution around calcaneal medial tuberosity ; rigid curve geometric bottom able relief plantar fascia stretch push-off phase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The plantar fascia long consider play important role weight-bearing foot , static stance dynamic function . Various functional structural role indicate virtue anatomical attachment . Excessive repetitive loading concentrate upon plantar fascia consider influential factor plantar fasciitis development . Abnormal foot structure may lead high risk plantar fasciitis . However , biomechanical factor may cause plantar fasciitis thoroughly investigate . Orthotic device common treatment use plantar fasciitis . However , direct quantitative data , stress strain distribution plantar fascia patient foot orthosis gait . Therefore , aim three-year project study investigate biomechanical mechanism different foot structure understand biomechanical response plantar fascia stance phase gait cycle dynamic finite element analysis , gait analysis well plantar pressure measurement . In addition , efficacy foot orthoses evaluate research process . In research , plantar fascia specific finite element foot model tibia reconstruct magnetic resonance image obtain subject normal foot , flat foot high arch foot structure . The subject also serve plantar soft tissue material property testing , gait analysis well plantar pressure measurement . The kinematic kinetic data gait analysis plantar pressure measurement use validate accuracy dynamic finite element analysis . In addition , 20 normal , 10 flat foot 10 high-arch foot subject also recruit gait analysis plantar pressure measurement . The kinematic kinetic data gait analysis plantar pressure measurement compare result finite element analysis .</detailed_description>
