	<brief_title>Effects Green Tea Level Serum Uric Acid Healthy Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated serum uric acid relate risk development gout , common inflammatory arthritis men . Allopurinol , xanthine oxidase inhibitor , one uric-lowering agent commonly use patient suffer recurrent chronic gout . Nevertheless , use limited adverse effect serious allergic reaction patient . Green tea one frequently consume beverage , particularly Japan . Green tea contain high level catechin , Epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) abundant compound among type catechin . Antioxidant effect contribute various potential health benefit green tea . Several in-vitro study find green tea inhibits xanthine oxidase activity subsequently decrease reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) uric acid production . We therefore would like investigate hypouricemic effect green tea . The study consist three period total duration four week . The first week control period . The following two week interventional period last week follow period . Thirty healthy participant randomly assign three experimental group , receive 2 gm/day , 4 gm/day 6 gm/day ( capsule , two time meal ) green tea extract interventional period . Blood urine sample take begin end study period .</detailed_description>
