	<brief_title>Safety Study Replagal® Therapy Children With Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2008 , change agalsidase alfa drug substance manufacturing process make . There change drug product formulation , manufacture site , manufacture process , container closure . An agalsidase alfa bioreactor manufacturing process ( agalAF1 ) utilize animal component-free medium replace previous roller bottle ( RB ) process . This study evaluate safety Replagal AF , manufacture use new bioreactor process dose 0.2 mg/kg infuse IV 40 minute , every week ( EOW ) child Fabry disease 7 year less 18 year age naive ERT .</detailed_description>

All patient must diagnose Fabry disease follow criterion : Male Patients : The patient hemizygous male Fabry disease confirm deficiency alfagalactosidase A activity measure serum , leukocytes , fibroblast confirm mutation alfagalactosidaseA gene . Female Patients : The patient heterozygous female Fabry disease confirm mutation alfagalactosidase A gene . Note : If diagnosis Fabry disease previously document patient 's medical record , screen test need repeat . 2 . The patient 7 &lt; 18 year age 3 . The patient ERTnaïve 4 .
