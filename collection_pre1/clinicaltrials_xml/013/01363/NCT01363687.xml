	<brief_title>The Effect Remote Postconditioning Graft Function Patients Undergoing Living-related Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ischemic reperfusion injury kidney transplantation common clinical problem associate high morbidity mortality . To reduce adverse effect ischemic reperfusion injury organ transplantation , various strategy include ischemic preconditioning postconditioning . Remote ischemic postconditioning one strategy brief ischemic reperfusion injury one organ protect organ sustain ischemic reperfusion injury . Remote ischemic postconditioning limb tourniquet safe convenient method postconditioning organ ischemic reperfusion injury . However , efficacy remote ischemic postconditioning patient undergo live donor kidney transplantation need establish . Therefore , investigate efficacy remote ischemic postconditioning upper limb tourniquet recipient kidney transplantation measure marker acute kidney injury .</detailed_description>
