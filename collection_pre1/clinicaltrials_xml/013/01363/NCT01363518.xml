	<brief_summary>The subject 's broken humerus ( arm ) suitable treatment fracture brace operative fixation plate screw . Both types treatment often use doctor fix broken bone . If subject agree participate study , subject assign treat surgeon one follow group : Group B : Non-operative treatment fracture brace Group P : plate &amp; screw - metal device place top bone . The investigator collect information subject 's arm fracture treat examination X-rays . X-rays obtain often first several month , depend fracture healing . This determined doctor determine subject 's participation research study . Both treatment routinely use study hope provide information regard type treatment subject 's functional outcome . A subject 's treatment affect whether choose participate research study . The treatment subject different study . The treat surgeon discus patient prefer treatment isolated humeral shaft fracture . If meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , approach participation one two treatment group depend previous decision patient treat surgeon . Hypotheses : 1 . Patients isolated humeral shaft fracture plat rapid return ADL 's , work full functional capacity patient treat conservatively . 2 . Patients treated plate technique rapid improvement functional outcome score , decrease pain score patient satisfaction manage conservatively . 3 . Complication rate infection iatrogenic neurologic injury high patient treat operatively . 4 . Nonunion malunion high patient manage conservatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Operative Versus Nonoperative Treatment Humeral Shaft Fractures : A Prospective Cohort Comparison Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . Rationale Humeral shaft fracture ( OTA 12A , B C ) uncommon injury long consider fracture , respond well conservative ( nonoperative ) management . Since Bohler 's ( 1964 ) statement humeral shaft fracture `` benign fracture long bone '' , many additional peer-reviewed publication conclude conservative management injury , isolation , produce excellent uncomplicated result . Sarmiento 's work result treatment algorithm utilize functional bracing remain accepted standard care isolated humeral shaft fracture . Much early work operative treatment injury reflect result , often poor , obtain utilizing early generation implant surgical technique . In addition , number study report result humeral shaft fracture manage intramedullary nail . Although controversy remain , believe publication McCormack , et.al.1 Chapman , et.al.2 conclude prospective randomize comparison fashion plat produce superior outcome intramedullary nailing humeral shaft fracture . Very exist publications3-7 compare conservative versus operative treatment humeral shaft fracture . Of , one ( Nast-Kolb , et.al.3 ) prospective manner . Even study include patient various associate possibly confound injury treatment selection control randomized way . No study ever compare result isolate humeral shaft fracture treat conservatively/nonoperatively versus operatively prospective cohort comparison . In addition , study humeral shaft fracture utilized form validate functional outcome measure draw conclusion give treatment option . B. Hypothesis Objective The objective study determine whether isolated humeral shaft fracture optimally treat internal fixation bracing . Specific Aim # 1 To determine heal rate operative non operative management prospective study . Hypothesis 1 . Nonunion malunion high patient manage conservatively . Specific Aim # 2 The DASH outcomes patient treat operatively return pre-injury status faster non operative treatment . Hypothesis 2.Patients isolated humeral shaft fracture operatively stabilize improved functional outcome score measure DASH score patient treat conservatively . Specific Aim # 3 To determine VAS derive pain score . Hypothesis 3 . Patients treat operative fixation decrease pain score measure VAS 2 6 week manage conservatively . Specific Aim # 4 To determine overall complication rate two group . Hypothesis 4 . Complication rate infection iatrogenic neurologic injury high patient treat operatively . C. Research Strategy We believe need study support publish data obtain retrospective review two hundred thirteen ( 213 ) close humeral shaft fracture treat operatively plat nonoperatively two Level I trauma center past five year . These finding indicate high malunion nonunion rate statistical significance nonoperative group . We complete pilot prospective , randomized cohort study 62 patient enrol 31 group . We believe large , prospective randomize study answer question well treatment term functional outcome treatment humeral shaft fracture need . This investigation consist prospective , surgeon base multicenter clinical trial evaluate non-operative versus operative treatment isolated humeral shaft fracture . C1.Study Participants This investigation consist prospective multicenter clinical trial evaluate non-operative versus operative treatment isolated humeral shaft fracture . We anticipate participation multiple Level I trauma center ; experience similar research study design . The PI Co-investigators participate pilot study , along investigator 5 additional center . The study protocol require IRB/HAC approval participate center . Patient Recruitment Screening When patient 18-65 year old present humeral shaft fracture , screen possible enrollment study use inclusion/exclusion criterion . If patient deem appropriate treating surgeon , mean meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion , patient give consent form read review patient time allow answer question . If patient agrees enter study , sign consent form . Randomization The patient provide informed consent randomize one two treatment group : Patients brace group ( B ) treat fracture brace patient randomized plate group ( P ) treat open reduction internal fixation ( ORIF ) plate . Each arm study separately randomize via computer-generated number Data Control Center . Assessment . The DASH ( Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand ) Outcome Measure utilize functional assessment tool . As tool well validated upper extremity injury normative data , believe good choice study population . The questionnaire administer ( compare operative non operative treatment , patient 's baseline function ) 6 week , 3 , 6 12 month post-injury . In addition visual analogue pain scale ( VAS ) administer 2 week , 6 week , 3 , 6 12 month . C2 . Treatment Patient present humeral shaft fracture initially treatment . All patient close reduction adequate sedation Emergency Department application coaptation splint sling . If meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , approach participation one two treatment group . Informed consent obtain . Patients operative group ( P ) schedule elective surgery plate fixation humeral shaft fracture within 2 week date injury . The surgical approach , plate brand , plate size discretion treat orthopaedic surgeon . Patients non-operative group ( B ) clinical follow-up schedule . A humeral fracture brace apply office . A sling optional patient comfort . After fracture brace application , patient instruct perform pendulum exercise shoulder mobility . Exercises elbow , wrist hand also encourage . The patient instruct adjust tension brace twice per week sleep semi-erect position first six week . ( These instruction standard care fracture brace treatment ) . The fracture brace worn patient meet clinical radiographic heal criterion describe protocol . D. Research Area Although accepted standard non-operative management isolated humeral shaft fracture remain largely unchanged unchallenged several decade ; prospective , comparative data incorporate validated patient outcome measure lack . Specifically , data compare non-operative versus operative treatment isolated humeral shaft fracture publish . We endeavor scientifically evaluate two different treatment isolated humeral shaft fracture determine treatment option prospective study may provide good functional outcome less complication .</detailed_description>
