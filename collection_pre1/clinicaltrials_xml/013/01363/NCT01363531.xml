	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Assessment Delayed Antibiotic Treatment Strategies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim PDA study ass efficacy safety different delay antibiotic prescribing strategy , compare direct antibiotic treatment antibiotic treatment , treatment non-complicated acute respiratory infection , term symptoms duration severity . Moreover , antibiotic consumption , patient satisfaction , efficacy perception number medical visit also assess therapeutic strategy . The PDA multicentric study , parallel , randomise control trial compare four antibiotic prescribe strategy non-complicated acute respiratory tract infection . The trial include acute pharyngitis and/or acute tonsillitis , rhinosinusitis , acute bronchitis acute exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( mild moderate ) adult . The expected number patient include trial 600 . Therapeutic strategy include : direct antibiotic treatment , antibiotic treatment , two delay antibiotic prescribing strategy ( prescription give patient advice use course antibiotic need case worsen symptom improve , prescription leave reception primary care center 3 day first medical visit ) .

The doctor include patient infection reasonable doubt patient treat antibiotic General Patients participate PDA previously . Patients severely affect patient felt severely affect week ( time ) Patients symptoms sign suggestive serious illness severely affect and/or complication ( particularly pneumonia , mastoiditis , peritonsillar abscess , peritonsillar cellulitis , intraorbital intracranial complication ) . Patients high risk serious complication due prior comorbidity . This include significant heart disease , lung , kidney , liver neuromuscular , immunosuppression , cystic fibrosis .
