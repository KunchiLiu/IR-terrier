	<brief_summary>The investigator previously demonstrate Advanced Glycation End product ( AGEs ) associate several chronic disease human blood AGE level significantly reduce simply change way food cook . This interventional-randomized study try determine whether diet low AGE follow 1 year effectively reduce circulate AGE level well marker metabolic syndrome group patient abnormal marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Low Advanced Glycation End Products ( AGE ) Diet Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The metabolic syndrome ( MetSyn ) , well-defined cluster pathogenic condition , include glucose intolerance , insulin resistance ( pre-diabetes ) , hypertension , abdominal obesity , dyslipidemia . The MetSyn strong inflammatory component raise risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) five-fold diabetes two fold age . Although , excessive caloric intake , i.e . `` nutrition '' know involved develop MetSyn , actual causative agent MetSyn human nutrition determine . The investigator previously show Advanced Glycation End product ( AGEs ) induce oxidant stress inflammatory response modulate insulin signal animal model recently human . These study separate effect `` over-nutrition '' pro-inflammatory effect AGEs , factor previously consider . These data support hypothesis AGE-restriction could important intervention MetSyn age . The investigator would like demonstrate safe , practical economical intervention arrest progression three major `` epidemic '' age : diabetes , obesity , vascular disease associate metabolic syndrome . This simple intervention could significant health economic implication . Our hypothesis dietary AGE restriction reverse several cardinal manifestation MetSyn , specifically insulin resistance , abdominal obesity cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
