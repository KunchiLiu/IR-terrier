	<brief_summary>The aim trial optimize treatment induce remission patient non-life-threatening anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody vasculitis ( AAV ) . The intent reduce toxicity induction therapy reduce overall exposure eliminate entirely use systemic corticosteroid induction period inhibitor complement C5a receptor plus cyclophosphamide rituximab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy CCX168 Subjects With ANCA-Associated Vasculitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary safety objective study evaluate safety tolerability CCX168 subject AAV background cyclophosphamide rituximab treatment . The primary efficacy objective evaluate efficacy CCX168 base Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score ( BVAS ) version 3 . The secondary objective study include assessment feasibility reduce eliminate use corticosteroid treatment subject ANCA-associated vasculitis without need rescue corticosteroid measure effect CCX168 several disease parameter .</detailed_description>
