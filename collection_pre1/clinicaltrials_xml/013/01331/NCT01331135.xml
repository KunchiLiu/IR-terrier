	<brief_summary>The best treatment recurrent cancer respond therapy know . Typically , patient cancer receive combination cancer drug ( chemotherapy ) , surgery , radiation therapy . These treatment prolong life may offer long-term cure . This study propose use drug call Sirolimus combination common chemotherapy drug treat patient recurrent refractory solid tumor . Sirolimus find inhibit cell growth anti-tumor activity pediatric solid tumor previous study , therefore , potential increase effectiveness chemotherapy drug give together . This study wil investigate high dose Sirolimus give orally oral chemotherapy drug . Cohorts 2 subject start minimum dose . The dose increase next 2 subject long major reaction previous group . This study also seek learn side effect sirolimus use combination effect drug white cell immune system . Successful use drug impact cancer population greatly provide increase chance survival resistant recurrent cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sirolimus , potent immunosuppressive drug approve use prevention allograft rejection follow solid organ transplant . It anti-tumor effect mainly block signal drive cell G1 S phase cell cycle inhibition mTOR , thus inhibit cell growth . Sirolimus , well mTOR inhibitor , show anti-tumor activity pediatric solid tumor xenograft . Children relapse and/or refractory solid tumor need novel therapeutic approach . One option patient use prolonged exposure low dose antiangiogenic chemotherapy , agent etoposide cyclophosphamide . In phase I trial feasibility optimal dose daily sirolimus , combination daily celecoxib , low dose etoposide alternate cyclophosphamide , determine child relapse refractory solid tumor . p70S6 kinase inhibition use surrogate mTOR inhibition . The potential immunosuppressive effect sirolimus administer schedule assess serial lymphocyte subset assessment memory T cell number .</detailed_description>
