COPD cause commonly tobacco smoking , trigger abnormal inflammatory response lung . Worldwide , COPD rank sixth lead cause death 1990 .

COPD responsible 16000 death per year France , 100 000 hospitalization per year health care expenditure COPD France 3.5 billion Euros . Classical marker disease severity , force expiratory volume one second , poorly correlate dyspnea prognosis . Therefore , many study focus control breathe attempt understand pathophysiological mechanism involve progression disease . Breathing control enhance patient COPD due progressive failure respiratory muscle ( airflow obstruction , static dynamic hyperinflation , positive intrinsic end expiratory pressure ) , ventilation/ perfusion ratio abnormality lead loss gaz exchange efficiency . Inspiratory command depend medulla automatic pathway voluntary corticospinal command . Indirect method breathe control estimation suggest COPD patient increase excitability neuron involve voluntary diaphragm activation reduce cortical reserve . This may represent increase risk factor acute respiratory failure . Until , study report central breathing control cerebral fMRI COPD patient .</brief_summary>
