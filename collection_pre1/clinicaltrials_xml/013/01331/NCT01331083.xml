	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether new drug PX-866 slow growth prostate cancer . The investigator also watch carefully side effect PX-866 might cause .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study PX-866 Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PX 866 new type drug inhibits molecule relate cancer cell growth . While molecule also find normal cell , much active cancer cell , inhibit molecule PX-866 hop slow growth cancer cell . Laboratory test show may help slow growth prostate cancer animal , know whether effect human . PX-866 study cancer patient find safe dos give undergone study prostate cancer . This study first study PX-866 prostate cancer . Health Canada approve sale use PX-866 treat prostate cancer , although approve use clinical trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histological cytological diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate . All patient must formalin fixed paraffin embed tissue ( primary metastatic tumour ) available translational study . Presence clinically and/or radiologically document disease ( measureable nonmeasurable ) . All radiology study must perform within 28 day prior registration ( within 35 day negative ) . Androgen ablation must include either medical surgical castration . If patient receive medical androgen ablation , castrate level testosterone ( &lt; 1.7 nmol/L ) must present . Patients must metastatic locally recurrent disease , curative therapy exist systemic therapy indicate . No prior chemotherapy regimens recurrent disease For Part A , patient must progression define : PSA Progression : A rise PSA , receive androgen ablative therapy , 2 subsequent rise reference value ( necessarily consecutively ) , measure minimum one week apart . The PSA confirm progression must value ≥ 5 ng/ml must perform long 7 day prior trial registration . OR Radiological Progression : define development new metastatic lesion stable rise PSA . Patients enter Part B study ( 2nd stage accrual complete ) must rise PSA abiraterone/prednisone continue time registration ( ≥ 25 % high baseline nadir , whichever low ) . The PSA must ≥5 ng/ml time study entry . ECOG performance 0 , 1 2 . Age ≥ 18 year age . Previous therapy : Surgery : Previous major surgery permit provide least 14 day prior patient registration wound heal occur . Hormonal Therapy : Prior hormone therapy require . Patients must hormone refractory discontinue antiandrogens least 4 week prior study entry ( least 6 week bicalutamide ) . Therapy LHRH agonist must continue prostate cancer patient already receive treatment time enrollment . If patient discontinue LHRH agonist , must restart ( surgically castrate ) castrate level testosterone must present . Prior therapy CYP17 inhibitor ( e.g . abiraterone , ketoconazole ) novel antiandrogens ( e.g . MDV3100 ) permit . Part B : Patients must hormone refractory discontinue antiandrogens least 4 week prior study entry ( least 6 week bicalutamide ) . Therapy LHRH agonist must continue prostate cancer patient already receive treatment time enrollment . If patient discontinue LHRH agonist , must restart ( surgically castrate ) castrate level testosterone must present . All patient must currently receive abiraterone . Radiation : Prior external beam radiation permit provide minimum 2 week elapse last dose enrollment trial . Exceptions may make low dose , nonmyelosuppressive radiotherapy consultation NCIC CTG . Prior strontium permit . Laboratory Requirements ( must do within 7 day prior registration ) Hematology : Granulocytes ( AGC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 100 x 10^9/L Biochemistry : Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x UNL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x UNL ALT AST ≤ 1.5 x UNL Glucose ≤ 8.9 mmol/L ( ≤ Grade 1 ) PSA ≥ 5ng/mL Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrollment trial document willingness participate . Patients give inform consent ( i.e . mentally incompetent patient , physically incapacitate comatose patient ) recruit study . Patients competent physically unable sign consent form may document sign nearest relative legal guardian . Each patient provide full explanation study consent request . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 2 hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . Investigators must assure patient registered trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , response assessment followup . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient registration . Patients history malignancy , except adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease &gt; =3 year . Known HIVpositive patient . Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus . Patients upper gastrointestinal condition would preclude compliance absorption oral medication eligible . Patients active uncontrolled infection , serious illness medical condition would permit patient manage accord protocol . Patients eligible know hypersensitivity study drug ( ) component . Patients history central nervous system metastasis untreated spinal cord compression . Patients prior treatment PI3 kinase inhibitor . Men sterile unless use adequate method birth control . Patients enrol Part B must suitable continued therapy abiraterone/prednisone .</criteria>
