	<brief_summary>Freezing Gait ( FoG ) class symptom occur Parkinson 's patient . Also call motor block , FoG characterize sudden inability move low extremity usually last less 10 second . The exact pathophysiology FoG poorly understand , treatment levodopa appear improve FoG observe off-state . As Parkinson 's patient progress severity , FoG on-state increase frequency appear resistant dopaminergic therapy . There additional evidence norepinephrine well dopaminergic system may involve FoG . Droxidopa approve use Japan since 1989 treatment frozen gait dizziness associate Parkinson 's Disease . This study explore safety efficacy droxidopa indication .</brief_summary>
