	<brief_title>Disrupting Bone Marrow Microenvironment With G-CSF Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , combine G-CSF prim prior administration salvage chemotherapy regimen ALL . Abundant data suggest leukemic cell receive key growth survival signal bone marrow microenvironment . Our preclinical data show 4-5 day G-CSF treatment associate loss osteoblasts decrease expression key chemokine/ cytokine support lymphocyte development . The investigator hypothesize G-CSF disrupt protective effect bone marrow microenvironment augment effect chemotherapy adult ALL . This pilot study G-CSF prim adult patient relapse refractory ALL determine feasibility characterize effect G-CSF treatment marrow microenvironment .</detailed_description>
