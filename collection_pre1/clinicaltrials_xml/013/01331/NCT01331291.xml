	<brief_summary>For many brain tumor , one reason chemotherapy drug might effective drug may able get brain tumor kill cancer cell . The brain protect layer call blood brain barrier . This barrier prevent substance enter . The purpose research study determine bosutinib get past blood brain barrier brain tumor , see well bosutinib work kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bosutinib Adult Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Arm A : Participants receive daily dos bosutinib orally 7-9 day prior surgery . On day schedule surgery ( either craniotomy surgical resection plan treat doctor ) , participant take bosutinib within 6-12 hour surgery . During surgery , tissue sample tumor collect test level bosutinib brain . A contrast-enhanced MRI CT scan do within day surgery . Daily dose bosutinib resume recovery period 10 day . From , study divide 28-day cycle . The following tests/procedures perform regularly cycle study treatment : medical history ; physical exam ; blood test ; contrast-enhanced CT MRI scan ( even number cycle ) . - Arm B : Participants receive daily dos bosutinib . The study divide int 28-day cycle . There break take bosutinib treatment cycle . The following tests/procedures perform regularly cycle study treatment : medical history ; physical exam ; blood test ; contrast-enhanced CT MRI scan ( even number cycle ) . - Participants may continue receive daily bosutinib disease worsens , experience unmanageable side-effects , decide stop treatment .</detailed_description>
