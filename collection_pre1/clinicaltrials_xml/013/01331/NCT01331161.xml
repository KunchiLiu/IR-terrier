	<brief_summary>Vaccination effective way prevent infectious disease . Despite success vaccine general , vaccine induce diminish antibody response low protection elderly particular . This could explain defect early response age immune system . A good understanding basic immunological mechanism mediate vaccine efficacy incomplete . Such information critical could greatly decrease cost time new vaccine development particularly geriatric population . In trial , investigator study immunologic difference FDA approve licensed shingle vaccine young old group . Thirty three healthy volunteer age 25-40 forty four healthy volunteer age 60-79 enrolled study . Each participant study give one shingle shoot . Blood work obtain one month vaccination , day vaccination , one day , three day , seven day , fourteen day , one month , three month six month vaccination . Throughout duration study , participant monitor safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systems Biology Zoster Vaccine ( ZOSTAVAX® ) Young Elderly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : Zoster vaccine know induce diminished antigen-specific T cell response low protection elderly . Here hypothesize due intrinsic defect innate response live attenuate virus , translate sub-optimal functional adaptive immune response . Therefore , early innate signature vaccination correlate , predict immunogenicity Zoster vaccine young elderly . STUDY DESIGN : Double center , open label study adult healthy volunteer vaccinate Zoster vaccine . Blood sample collect day D-30 ( pre- vaccination ) D0 ( vaccination ) D1 , D3 , D7 , D14 , D30 , D90 D180 ( post vaccination ) study innate adaptive immunity response . Even though Zoster vaccine consider safe , volunteer ask report record local systemic AEs 7 day post-vaccination . Also AEs report 30 day post-vaccination SAE 180 day post vaccination . AEs develop day blood draw also report</detailed_description>
