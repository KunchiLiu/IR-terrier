	<brief_title>Sequential Chemotherapy With Xelox Follows TX Treat Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer one frequent cancer type Taiwan . Advanced gastric cancer incurable . Although chemotherapy improve survival maintain quality life patient advance gastric cancer , optimal chemotherapy disease define . Cytotoxic agent commonly use disease include platinum compound , fluoropyrimidines taxanes . A phase III ( V325 ) study show add docetaxel cisplatin 5-FU ( TCF ) improve response rate , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) . Although TCF regimen improve clinical outcome , associate substantial toxicity particularly related myelosuppression , 29 % incidence febrile neutropenia neutropenic infection1 . Several modification TCF regimen make maintain efficacy reduce toxicity . Cunningham et al . evaluate impact substitute oxaliplatin cisplatin capecitabine 5-FU epirubicin , cisplatin , 5-FU ( ECF ) regimen . Oxaliplatin compare cisplatin demonstrate comparable efficacy , low incidence myelosuppression , thromboembolic complication , nephrotoxicity . The combination docetaxel oxaliplatin evaluate gastric cancer moderate activity four phase II trial . A different way include active agent first line treatment advance gastric cancer use sequentially . Sequential schedule may maximize dose-intensity single agent avoid overlap toxicity cause concomitant administration active drug . Two study use sequential strategy treat advance gastric cancer reported.7-8 One use docetaxel PELF regimen , use cisplatin plus 5-Fluorouracil / leucovorin ( 5-FU/LV ) follow irinotecan plus 5-FU/LV , follow docetaxel plus 5-FU/LV . Both study show sequential approach produce good treatment efficacy manageable toxicity management advance gastric cancer . In hospital , complete two phase II study advance gastric cancer , include XELOX ( capecitabine plus oxaliplatin ) modify TCF regimen ( docetaxel plus cisplatin oral tegafur/uracil plus leucovorin ) . After analyze result , median time response , time progression overall survival around 3 , 6 , 10 month , respectively . Overall response rate around 50 % . Based consideration previous experience , hence initiate phase II study evaluate feasibility anti-tumor activity new strategy consist two sequential regimen involve XELOX TX unresectable gastric cancer .</detailed_description>
