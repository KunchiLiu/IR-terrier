	<detailed_description>This single-center study 1 . STUDY OBJECTIVES 1.1 Primary Objective Compare bone measurement ( pQCT radius DXA scan lumbar spine total body ) child CF 6-12 year age healthy child . Measurements pQCT compare include cortex width , trabecular bone mineral density ( BMD ) , volumetric BMD . Measurements DXA compare include total body bone mineral density lumbar spine ( L1-L4 ) BMD . 1.2 Secondary Objectives Compare Z-scores pQCT parameter Z-scores BMD measure DXA child CF 6-12 year age . The Z-scores CF subject pQCT measurement ( cortex width , trabecular BMD , volumetric BMD ) DXA measurement ( total body BMD lumbar spine BMD ) compare . Compare correlation pQCT parameter BMD measure DXA marker bone turnover inflammation ( serum propeptide type I collagen ( PICP ) , total serum deoxypyridinoline , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alpha ) child CF 6-12 year age healthy control . As exploratory specific aim , correlation serum marker bone measurement Specific Aim 1 evaluate . 2 . BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) affect estimate 30,000 people United States1 cause mutation gene encode protein call CF transmembrane regulator ( CFTR ) . This protein function chloride channel epithelial cell multiple organ system . The mutation result dysfunctional absent CFTR channel decrease chloride secretion , ultimately result increase viscosity secretion . Children CF less able clear pulmonary secretion become colonized bacterial pathogen regularly cause exacerbation lung disease . The hallmark CF recurrent pulmonary exacerbation decline pulmonary function . Respiratory failure cause death 90 % people CF . However , also extrapulmonary manifestation CF affect health quality life . These include CF related diabetes , liver disease , bone disease . The median age survival patient CF increase steadily currently 37 years.1 With improvement life expectancy , become increasingly important address long-term complication CF . There high prevalence osteopenia osteoporosis among adult pediatric patient CF steadily increase age . There also associated increase fracture rate kyphosis adult . Studies evaluate fracture risk child CF generate mixed result . Henderson et al report increased rate fracture girl CF , boys , comparison healthy control . A recent study Rovner et al show increase fracture risk among child mild moderate lung disease . Bisphosphonates use treat osteopenia osteoporosis adult CF clinical trial show increase bone mineral density ( BMD ) therapy . However , publish data demonstrate reduced fracture rate bisphosphonate therapy . Furthermore , currently consensus treat osteopenia osteoporosis child CF ensure adequate nutrition vitamin D level . Although CF bone disease considerably prevalent adult child , screen bone disease must address childhood maximize peak bone mass potentially minimize bone related disease patient . Biochemical marker bone turnover may use evaluate derangement bone formation and/or resorption . Studies conduct CF patient show general decrease marker bone formation increase marker bone resorption . Conway et al report correlation marker bone turnover spinal total body BMD ; however , study evaluate whether bone turnover marker correlate pQCT parameter . Serum PICP peptide cleave carboxy-terminal end collagen type I marker bone formation . Deoxypyridinoline cross-linking amino acid release bone matrix resorption , thus marker bone resorption . The etiology bone disease patient CF multifactorial contribute factor include poor nutrition , decrease activity level , poor absorption vitamin D , chronic inflammation , therapy corticosteroid . Multiple study correlate BMD clinical factor lung function , nutritional status , inflammation marker , clinical score , frequency antibiotic course . Studies evaluate relationship inflammation marker bone CF patient somewhat mixed , although general show inverse relationship inflammation BMD , direct correlation inflammation increase bone resorption marker . Inflammation marker evaluate include acute-phase cytokine IL-6 TNF-alpha , general marker CRP . There evidence CFTR express bone cell osteoclast , osteoblast , osteocyte , suggest potential bone phenotype patient CF . Most study utilize DXA demonstrate reduce BMD patient CF usually detectable start adolescence . Low BMD nearly universal among adults CF ; however , result study evaluate BMD child CF variable . A study conduct adolescent young adult CF utilize pQCT evaluate bone geometry radius . Although BMD normal subject , pQCT data indicate subject reduce cortical thickness . Reduced cortical thickness show cadaveric study predictive mechanical strength . Currently , patient CF evaluate annually bone disease DXA , screen usually start approximately age . However , study suggest approach may sufficient detect early bone change may impact fracture risk . Furthermore , bone disease child may manifest early adolescence , would suggest screen start earlier age vulnerable patient . The follow study therefore propose translational pilot study examine potential role pQCT screen approach bone disease child CF . The investigator expect find bone deficit pQCT DXA , good correlation inflammation bone turnover marker pQCT measurement DXA measurement .</detailed_description>
