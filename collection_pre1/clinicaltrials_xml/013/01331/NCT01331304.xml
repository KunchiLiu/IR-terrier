	<brief_title>Comparative Effectiveness Study Bipolar Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mood stabilizer , medication prevent future mood episode , foundation treatment bipolar disorder . While publish bipolar disorder treatment guideline recommend pharmacotherapy include mood stabilizer long-term maintenance treatment , randomize comparative effectiveness study examine real-world advantage disadvantage newer second generation antipsychotic ( SGA ) mood stabilizer compare classic mood stabilizer , lithium ( Li ) . No study look effectiveness SGAs compare mood stabilizer use context medication require manage bipolar patient , since bipolar disorder patient take median 3 medication optimal outcome . Quetiapine ( QTP ) extensively study , broadly efficacious widely prescribe SGA bipolar disorder . The classic mood stabilizer Li large evidence base treat bipolar disorder , largely supplant SGAs . Thus , study compare symptomatic benefit adverse effect burden QTP foundation adjunctive personalize treatment ( QTP+APT ) mood stabilizer foundation consist Li APT ( Li+APT ) . APT include medication need following exception : QTP+APT receive Li Li+APT group receive antipsychotic . If , however , participant clinically require switch , addition SGA mood stabilizer , medication add rescue strategy carefully record . Consistent effectiveness trial , participant able continue study require rescue treatment . The specific plan randomize , open , two arm , comparative effectiveness study QTP+APT vs. Li+APT treatment 6 month across 10 site . In summary , comparative effectiveness study compare fundamentally different acute continuation treatment bipolar disorder . The investigator address key question whether use prototypical mood stabilize SGA ( i.e. , QTP ) classical mood stabilizer Li foundational treatment context necessary adjunctive personalize treatment ( APT ) .</detailed_description>
