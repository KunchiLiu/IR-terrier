	<brief_summary>Background : - Older person often refer physician mobility difficulty grow bad age . To good understand reason mobility difficulty older person , researcher conduct population-based study individual live Chianti geographic area Tuscany , Italy . Researchers interested conduct follow-up study original participant assess effect age mobility . Objectives : - To conduct follow-up study participant mobility study old person Greve Chianti Bagno Ripoli area near Florence , Italy . Eligibility : - Original participant InChianti Mobility Study . Design : - The InChianti Follow-up Study repeat element baseline evaluation original study . Participants see 3-year anniversary baseline study assessment . - Participants home interview question physical mental health , family history , daily activity , live condition related continued mobility . - Participants provide blood urine sample , test heart motor nerve function image study bone circulatory system . - Participants also functional evaluation motor skill , include walk test , range motion test , grip strength .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In past decade epidemiologic clinical study describe prevalence incidence disability elucidate demographic characteristic , health behavior , disease , physiologic impairment associate increase risk develop disability old age . Mobility disability emerge critical aspect functioning . Mobility , define ability move independently one point another , critical part maintain independence essential attribute quality life . In age 85 year old , nearly 60 percent woman 40 percent men difficulty walk two three block . Older people mobile likely remain community , low rate subsequent morbidity mortality , high quality life . Recent work biomechanics , clinical geriatrics , epidemiology , clinical trial help improve understanding decline walk ability old age influence multiple intrinsic extrinsic factor . However , great deal still understood old person progressively lose ability ambulate . The InChianti Study potential make major new advance knowledge progressive decline ambulation old person . A great deal information available baseline evaluation study crosssectional analysis do data valuable . There , however , limitation learn cross-sectional data . The baseline data reveal many relationship factor study disability , may circularity relationship sort cross-sectional data available . For example , abnormalities certain biomarkers may cause disability may cause disability . Only longitudinal analysis begin non-disabled person temporal sequence determine . Cross-sectional analysis permit study factor currently relate disability longitudinal analysis allow identification subclinical marker risk predict future disability onset . There therefore much gain perform follow-up evaluation cohort obtain longitudinal data .</detailed_description>
