	<brief_summary>This study conduct assess effect topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ( NSAIDs ) macular retinal volume compare placebo eye non-central diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . A secondary objective study assess effect topical NSAIDs central subfield thickness compare progression non-central DME central DME determine optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) stereoscopic fundus photograph . Furthermore , phase II study conduct ( 1 ) determine whether conduct phase III trial merit base anatomic outcome , ( 2 ) estimate recruitment potential phase III investigation , ( 3 ) provide information outcome measure need design phase III trial . The study design establish efficacy NSAIDs treatment non- central DME .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NSAID Phase II Non-central Involved Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There strong evidence indicate prevention non-central involved DME progression central subfield macula good anatomic surrogate prevent visual acuity loss . Furthermore , prevalence macular edema estimate high among patient diabetes , likely approximately 25 % non-central involved case DME extend central subfield macula within one year . Thus , relatively safe economical treatment could identify reduce progression non-central involved edema central-involved edema least 50 % , treatment could major public health impact . There also evidence inflammation role DME , topical NSAID might effect retinal edema . Topical NSAIDs current widespread clinical use appear well tolerate safe administer chronically , make potentially attractive alternative treatment DME patient would like delay avoid laser photocoagulation intravitreal injection ( example , patient willing use daily eye drop avoid ocular procedure patient access experience retinal specialist apply laser photocoagulation treatment limit ) . This phase II trial may provide proof concept evidence topical NSAID treatment beneficial effect DME possibly prevent increase retinal volume progression non central-involved DME central subfield macula . Furthermore , could determine correlation OCT fundus photographic documentation progression DME central subfield clinical trial setting . Since effective treatment , include laser photocoagulation intravitreal injection , already exist DME treatment , topical NSAIDs would demonstrate substantial effect DME progression order sufficient clinical interest investigation . If beneficial effect apparent trial , utilize relatively small sample size short follow-up period , result phase II study might utilize planning future phase III trial . These future phase III trial could definitively answer whether NSAIDs efficacious novel therapeutic approach treatment DME prevent progression DME extend central subfield macula .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year Type 1 type 2 diabetes Only one study eye per subject may enrol . The study eye must meet following : Best correct EETDRS visual acuity letter score ≥ 74 ( i.e. , 20/32 better ) within 8 day enrollment . On clinical exam , definite retinal thickening due DME within 3000 μm center macula involve central subfield . Thickened noncentral macular subfields DRCR.net approve spectral domain OCT macular map . Central subfield thickness within threshold definition normal central subfield thickness DRCR.net approve spectral domain OCT machine . No focal/grid laser within last 6 month treatment DME within last 4 month . No anticipated need treat DME course study , unless eye meet criteria treatment ( Central subfield retinal thickness increase 310 μm spectral domain OCT machine baseline ) . Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) . Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes . Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes . Documented diabetes American Diabetes Association and/or World Health Organization criterion . At least one eye meet study eye criterion . Able willing provide inform consent . Successful completion runin phase level compliance 80 % Study Eye Inclusion Criteria Best correct EETDRS visual acuity letter score ≥74 ( i.e.20/32 good ) within 8 day randomization . On clinical exam , definite retinal thickening due DME within 3000 μm center macula involve central subfield . Thickened noncentral macular subfields spectral domain OCT macular map meet either follow criterion : At least two noncentral macular subfields OCT thickness threshold ( average normal + 2 SD ) DRCR.net approve spectral domain OCT machine see . At least one noncentral macular subfield OCT thickness least 15 μm threshold ( average normal + 2 SD ) DRCR.net approve spectral domain OCT machines—see DRCR.net procedures manual threshold detail . Central subfield thickness &lt; 250 micron obtain one follow DRCR.net approve spectral domain OCT machine : Zeiss Cirrus Heidelberg Spectralis Optovue RTVue Media clarity , pupillary dilation , study participant cooperation sufficient adequate OCT fundus photograph . If study participant multiple ocular drop , investigator believe study participant compliant multidrop regimen . A study participant eligible runin phase randomize trial follow exclusion criterion present : A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . Subjects poor glycemic control , within last 4 month , initiate intensive insulin treatment ( pump multiple daily injection ) plan next 4 month enrol . Use systemic corticosteroid antiVEGF therapy . Current use prescription systemic NSAIDs . History autoimmune disease rheumatoid arthritis . Participation investigational trial involve treatment drug within 30 day randomization receive regulatory approval time study entry . Note : study participant receive another investigational drug participate study . Known allergy component study drug . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 mmHg ( systolic 180 diastolic 110 mmHg ) If blood pressure bring 180/110 antihypertensive treatment , study participant become eligible . Participant expect move area clinical center area cover another clinical center 12 month study . For woman childbearing potential : pregnant lactate intend become pregnant within next 12 month . Women potential study participant question potential pregnancy . Investigator judgment use determine pregnancy test need . Study Eye Exclusion Criteria History focal/grid laser within last 6 month treatment DME within last 4 month Note : Throughout study , distribution subject prior treatment DME evaluate , eligibility criterion may tailor add balance subject prior treatment subject without prior treatment DME . Anticipated need treat DME course study ( Any DME treatment study follow criterion section 4.3 ) . History use NSAID eye drop within last 30 day anticipate need drop study due ocular condition History panretinal ( scatter ) photocoagulation ( PRP ) within 4 month prior randomization Anticipated need PRP 6 month follow randomization Anticipated need cataract extraction surgery study eye study period Lipid fovea ( center macula ) History major ocular surgery ( include scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within prior 4 month major ocular surgery anticipate within next 6 month follow randomization An ocular condition , diabetic macular edema , present , opinion investigator , visual acuity might affect ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , pigment abnormality , dense subfoveal hard exudate , nonretinal condition , epiretinal membrane vitreomacular traction ) course study ( e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , neovascular glaucoma , etc . ) History YAG capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior randomization Exam evidence severe external ocular infection , include conjunctivitis , chalazion , substantial blepharitis Aphakia History vitrectomy reason History cataract surgery within prior 1 year Uncontrolled glaucoma</criteria>
