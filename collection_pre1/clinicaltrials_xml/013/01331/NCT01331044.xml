	<brief_summary>1 . RUTF would effective ( quick catch-up growth promote tissue accrue result decrease stay rehabilitation ward ) treat child SAM rehabilitation phase khichuri /halwa ; 2 . RUTF would acceptable child mothers/caregivers ; 3 . Malnutrition cause solely lack food , also impaired utilization food ingest . The ability gut absorb nutrient diet associate host 's 'human ' genotype , host 's gut microbiota gene content ( microbiome ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ready Use Therapeutic Food ( RUTF ) Severe Malnourished Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct research study compare acceptability efficacy RUTF cereal-based diet management hospitalise SAM child Bangladesh . After completion initial acute phase treatment ( diarrhoea , low respiratory tract infection/pneumonia , severe anaemia , fever , sepsis , electrolyte imbalance , and/or anorexia ) Longer Stay Ward/ Special Care Ward Dhaka Hospital , child transfer NRW accord enrolment criterion . Once child fulfil criterion entry study write consent participation obtain respective parents/guardian , randomly allocate : ( ) standard cereal-based food , namely khichuri halwa , ( ii ) RUTF . Randomization do accord computer-generated random number use permuted block block length four six . For understandable reason , dietary therapy ca n't blind . The assigned treatment package keep closed opaque envelop serial number assign enrolled child . Participating child discharge NRW accord new WHO growth standard ( WHO , 2009 ) , explicit , least seven day stay complete achieve weight gain 15 % , non-oedematous child . On hand oedematous child oedema free WHZ â‰¥-3 ; however oedema free WHZ &lt; - 3 child discharge achieve 15 % weight gain . In group , acceptability allocate diet , child respective mothers/caregivers , rate weight gain anthropometric measurement , adverse event systematically record analysis . Khichuri/halwa group give diet per standardized management protocol NRW Dhaka Hospital . On hand , child allocate RUTF receive commercially available RUTF ( Plumpy nut ) total 200 kcal/kg.day sequential manner ( Plumpy nut offer ~ 125 kcal/kg 1st 24 hour , ~ 150 kcal/kg 2nd 24 hour , then~200k cal/kg third day ) . We also examine weight gain child associate increase lean body mass body fat mass assess body composition , Changes body composition dietary intervention SAM child assess non-invasive technique use stable isotope tracer ( deuterium oxide ) . For , collection baseline urine saliva sample know quantity ( 5 gm ) deuterium oxide label water give study child . Enrichment deuterium body water measure estimate total body water ( TBW ) . Enrichment reach plateau 3-5 hour . According recommendation International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) field manual , two post-dose saliva sample collect 3rd 4th hour . The concentration deuterium saliva sample measure Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer ( FTIR ) . The urine specimen analyze use Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry ( IRMS ) . From measure TBW would estimate fat free mass ( FFM ) . Body fat mass ( FM ) difference body weight fat free mass . This procedure repeat sequence study child end dietary intervention study child achieve discharge criterion . In addition mention procedure , anthropometric measure mid-arm circumference , triceps skin fold thickness , arm fat area arm muscle area would also routinely record along morbidity data . We wish leverage ongoing scientific collaboration among University Virginia , Center Genome Sciences Washington University School Medicine , USA ICDDR , B gain insight influence human genetic polymorphism gut microbiome malnutrition , order provide foundation new treatment prevention program population-wide basis .</detailed_description>
