	<brief_summary>Ascites frequent complication patient portal hypertension . As portal hypertension progress , percentage patient develop refractory ascites . Management option point include either TIPS intermittent large volume paracentesis ( LVP ) , attendant risk , Portal hypertension accompany systemic circulatory dysfunction ( decreased systemic vascular resistance systolic BP ) , exacerbate large volume paracentesis , resultant renal cardiac dysfunction . There limited option manage patient acute decompensation , hepatorenal syndrome , although midodrine vasoconstrictor use patient . Midodrine use possible therapeutic ascites . Midodrine however , find change hemodynamics related portal hypertension ascites . There also change mediator related renal circulation study short duration ( 7 day ) find study 1 month duration , however clinical effect midodrine find long duration similar condition . The purpose study assess utility midodrine patient obvious systemic circulatory dysfunction ( hypotension ) improve outcome patient refractory ascites change hemodynamic parameter mediator . Specific endpoint include : 1 ) objective reduction volume/rate accumulation ascites 2 ) decrease frequency LVP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanism Effect Midodrine Portal Pressures Patients With Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The pathophysiology ascites complex various mechanism propose . Splanchnic systemic vasodilation relate excess nitric oxide associate systemic hypotension increase portal flow . ( 8-10 ) This associate hemodynamic compensatory mechanism , include activation renin-angiotension aldosterone system ( RAAS ) , sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) , non osmotic release anti-diuretic hormone ( ADH ) . ( 11 , 12 ) These ultimately result renal dysfunction , associate sodium fluid retention . ( 13 ) Several study show reversal HRS decrease circulatory dysfunction vasoconstrictor administer . Various vasoconstrictor ( noradrenaline , teleperessin , octreotide midodrine ) use management hepato renal syndrome ( HRS ) . ( 14-17 ) Midodrine appear advantage , include benefit oral medication . ( 18 ) The beneficial effect note early 6 hour use midodrine patient ascites without HRS ( 2 ) decrease plasma renin activity ( PRA ) , antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) , nitrite nitrate activity ( NOx ) , increase renal plasma flow ( RPF ) , glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) , increase urine sodium concentration ( UNa ) volume , increase mean atrial pressure ( MAP ) , decreased heart rate ( HR ) cardiac output ( CO ) . There also decrease aldosterone non-azotemic cirrhotic patient without ascites patient study 7 day . ( 3 ) The renal function improvement substantiate study . In patient treated month along octreotide significant improvement renal function marginal reversible liver dysfunction decrease body weight ( paracentesis adjust weight ) , ( 19 ) A similar significant weight reduction also note another study . ( 7 ) Midodrine show safe effective patient use prevent dialysis induced hypotension , improve systolic pressure , without significantly increase volume fluid filter dialysis change body weight patient study . ( 20 , 21 ) The beneficial effect attribute modulate effect autonomic function increase peripheral vessel resistance . ( 22 ) The drug find effective safe acute chronic use ( 21 , 23 ) minimal side effect . ( 24 ) Vasoconstrictors patient ascites hydrothorax In non azotemic cirrhotic patient ascites , addition octreotide improve diuresis decrease renin , increase MAP , decrease CO improve renal function increase GFR , increase urine sodium volume excretion . ( 25 ) In patient massive hydrothorax mild ascites azotemia , addition midodrine octreotide improves MAP , increase GFR , RPF urine sodium volume ; prevents recurrence hydrothorax . Vasoconstrictors recommend treatment hydrothorax ( 4-6 ) find beneficial refractory ascites . ( 26 ) Significance Vasoconstrictors like midodrine show beneficial , improvement circulatory dysfunction various group patient include patient HRS type 1 , type 2 , non azotemic patient patient require hemodialysis . There suggestion decrease body weight patient . In patient hydrothorax , addition vasoconstrictor help relieve symptom . The investigator suggest midodrine could also benefit patient refractory ascites . By decrease rate ascitic fluid accumulation , may possible decrease volume ascites drain lengthen interval paracentesis , give comfort patient . The beneficial effect portal pressure ascites could due mechanism ( autonomic function ) rather effect renal hemodynamics sustain . There study systematically analyze .</detailed_description>
