	<brief_title>Impact Nutritional Intervention Women With Breast Cancer Under Adjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With approximately 52,600 new case diagnose France 2010 , breast cancer common cancer woman , accord national projection incidence cancer mortality 2010 . Weight gain adulthood , overweight obesity , physical inactivity alcohol consumption risk factor commonly associate risk breast cancer ( mainly post-menopausal overweight obesity ) . Several hypothesis explain association obesity breast cancer : obesity , metabolic syndrome diabetes participate change hormone level ( estrogen , leptin , insulin ) promote mammary carcinogenesis tumor progression . The association obesity development breast cancer partly due increase serum level estradiol produce adipocytes , role insulin resistance inflammation associate obesity widely discuss . Reduced physical activity one factor likely weight gain woman adjuvant chemotherapy localize breast cancer . Furthermore , physical activity appropriately could improve many prognostic factor survival woman breast cancer . Thus , several large cohort study woman breast cancer show average mortality reduction 45 % associate moderate physical activity compare inactivity . Adapted Physical Activity ( APA ) could also improve fitness , quality life , body image , treatment compliance reduce fatigue . A rich fruit vegetable diet combine regular physical activity appear offer best protection breast cancer . The nature , frequency , duration , intensity arrangement physical training program meeting key element consider , metabolic response differ accord factor . The optimal management improve level physical activity appear individual least three session per week , 30 60 minute moderate intensity , allow physiological response chronic exercise adequate recovery . After diagnosis breast cancer , thus many possible risk factor mortality morbidity relate nutritional factor available management . These risk prevention management patient appear indispensable APA program . Thus , investigator propose test feasibility implement program dietary intervention APA prevent risk weight gain ( affect half patient ) maintain and/or increase level physical activity adjuvant chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
