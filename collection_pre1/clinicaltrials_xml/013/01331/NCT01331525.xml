	<brief_title>The Addition Ipilimumab Carboplatin Etoposide Chemotherapy Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase II trial addition Ipilimumab Carboplatin Etoposide chemotherapy first line treatment extensive stage small cell lung cancer ( ICE ) Indication : Extensive Stage Small cell lung cancer Primary Objective : To establish progression free survival 1 year patient extensive stage small cell lung cancer treat ipilimumab , carboplatin etoposide . Secondary Objective : To assess response toxicity combination ipilimumab carboplatin etoposide chemotherapy . Immunological Objectives : 1 . To examine whether ipilimumab stimulate humoral immune response onco-neuronal self-antigens The result measurement antibody onco-neuronal antigen use focus cellular biomarker analysis identify target assess cellular response : 2 . To measure effect ipilimumab CD8+ T-cells direct onco-neuronal antigen , presume responsible desired cytotoxic activity cancer cell . 3 . To evaluate immune response non-neuronal antigen presence ipilimumab . Rationale : Small cell lung cancer account around 20 % lung cancer presentation UK . Of approximately half present extensive disease , overall represent 4000 new case annually . Although initial response chemotherapy group patient range 50-60 % 1 , 2 , subsequent relapse inevitable result poor survival 5 % patient alive 2 year diagnosis . Despite attempt improve conventional chemotherapy platinum etoposide extensive stage small cell lung cancer , neither modification conventional chemotherapeutic drug , use novel target therapy show increased benefit . A conceptual change therapeutic strategy therefore require , immunotherapy attractive avenue pursue . Anti-CTLA4 antibody may allow development induction anti-tumour immunity even absence know tumour antigen without active anti-tumour vaccination . Chemotherapy effectively kill tumour cell release tumour derive antigens administration anti-CTL4 antibody may induce clinically useful anti-tumour immune response antigens . This trial therefore investigate addition anti-CTLA4 antibody ipilimumab conventional carboplatin etoposide chemotherapy extensive stage small cell lung cancer . Trial Design : Single stage non-randomised phase II trial Sample size : Patients recruit 40 patient treat chemo-immunotherapy . If 8 patient progression free 1 year treatment consider successful warrant test . Study Population : All patient consent form ITT population . â€¢ Patients receive least 1 dose Ipilimumab form analysis population ( N=40 ) . Dosage Regimen/Duration Treatment : Subjects receive 6 cycle carboplatin etoposide chemotherapy accord response toxicity . Carboplatin administer dose AUC = 6 ( calculate accord Calvert formula use Cockcroft Gault calculation creatinine clearance ) IV , day 1 . Etoposide administer 120mg/m2 IV day 1 , 100mg BD PO day 2 3 . Both chemotherapy drug deliver 21 day cycle ( q21 ) maximum 6 cycle deliver accord response unless progressive disease ( RECIST ) excessive toxicity . Ipilimumab administer dose 10mg/kg IV day 1 cycle 3-6 chemotherapy . In absence immune relate progression disease unacceptable toxicity , subsequent maintenance dos ipilimumab deliver every 12 week start week 30 dose 10 mg/kg unacceptable toxicity immune related disease progression . Tumour assessment : Tumour assessment CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis perform baseline follow time point progression : Weeks 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 , 52 12 weekly progression RECIST immune relate response criterion . Duration study : It expect current standard care trial take 24 month recruit completion trial anticipate 3 year . The study may however continue long patient continue receive maintenance ipilimumab , case study finish 100 day last dose ipilimumab ( clear last dose give ) patient die . Safety monitoring : Given different safety profile ipilimumab carboplatin / etoposide chemotherapy , overlap toxicity expect . However , throughout trial , close monitoring nature severity adverse event report on-going basis . A planned interim safety monitoring assessment perform . Once 9 patient treated combination least 6 week ( subject discontinue treatment earlier due excessive toxicity chemo-immunotherapy also consider ) , first clinical safety assessment perform identify early safety signal ipilimumab give combination carboplatin etoposide . In addition review safety may trigger throughout trial : If great equal 40 % subject treat develop great equal Grade 3 toxicity think relate study drug ; If great equal 10 % subject experience unexpected ipilimumab-related great equal Grade 3 toxicity alleviate control appropriate care and/or steroid and/or infliximab therapy within 14 day initiation therapy . In response ipilimumab-related death unless attributed disease progression . In circumstance data carefully review determine appropriate course action , could include : Continue without modification ; Continue modification study protocol . Modifications may include , limited , change inclusion/exclusion criterion , frequency safety monitoring , change ipilimumab dose , alteration study procedure ; Discontinue study ( provision orderly discontinuation accordance good medical practice ) extreme circumstance ( eg , insufficient benefit-to-risk effect experimental treatment ) . The decision put patient accrual hold review safety data take , base characteristic serious adverse event report ongoing basis . The review take account know toxicity profile ipilimumab carboplatin/etoposide , potential association immune-related Adverse Events ( irAEs ) clinical efficacy .</detailed_description>
