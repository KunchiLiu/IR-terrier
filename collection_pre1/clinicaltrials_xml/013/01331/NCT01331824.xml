	<brief_title>Trial Amrubicin Second-Line Therapy Patients With Advanced/Metastatic Refractory Urothelial Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple small phase II trial explore variety agent second-line therapy metastatic urothelial carcinoma perform . Overall , active agent show response rate approximately 10-20 % . Currently , FDA approve agent second-line treatment metastatic urothelial carcinoma . The current study explore safety activity novel anthracycline , amrubicin , second-line chemotherapy patient advance urothelial carcinoma . The primary objective evaluate activity ( determine objective response rate ) amrubicin second-line chemotherapy patient metastatic urothelial carcinoma . The secondary objective evaluate progression-free survival , survival 1 year , safety amrubicin second-line therapy patient metastatic urothelial carcinoma . Subjects receive amrubicin IV daily x 3 day , every 21-days , prophylactic granulocyte colony stimulate factor . This 21-day time period refer cycle . Subjects undergo repeat compute tomography ( CT ) scan every 2 cycle . In absence progressive cancer , prohibitive side effect , subject receive 6 cycle treatment amrubicin .</detailed_description>
