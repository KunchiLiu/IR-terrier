	<detailed_description>Background : Fluid accumulation dissect tissue plane longstanding problem follow surgical procedure . The common use close suction drain associate infection risk , wound heal complication , additional scarring , patient discomfort . Additionally , seroma formation drain removal often require invasive treatment . Therapies reduce fluid accumulation decrease need drain positive impact surgical practice . Objective : To study safety preliminary efficacy TissuGlu速 , novel surgical adhesive , management wound drainage abdominoplasty procedure . Material &amp; Methods : A blinded prospective randomize trial compare drain fluid output ( volume ) complication profile 40 subject undergoing abdominoplasty ( n=20 ) without ( n=20 ) use urethane base adhesive . The TissuGlu速 adhesive , required mixing preparation , administer abdominal wall use custom drop tip applicator prior closure abdominoplasty flap . Two Blake速 drain connect J-VAC suction reservoir place wound .</detailed_description>
