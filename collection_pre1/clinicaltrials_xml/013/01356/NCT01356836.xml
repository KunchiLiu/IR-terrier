	<brief_summary>Collateral growth coronary angiogenesis chronic adaptation myocardial ischemia . Collateralization help restore blood flow result salvage myocardium severely ischemic myocardial region . Thus , good collateral development patient severe coronary artery disease ( CAD ) improve ventricular function prognosis ( 1-3 ) . However , coronary collateral development different among patient even similar degree coronary artery stenosis . Several factor , diabetes mellitus ( 4 ) duration myocardial ischemic symptom ( 5 ) report effect coronary collateral development . At cellular level , inflammatory cell , especially monocytes important role collateralization . In series experimental study animal , show monocyte important element development collateral vessel ( 6-7 ) . In recent study , demonstrate increased circulating monocyte count relate good collateral development patient stable coronary artery disease ( 8 ) . Monocytes human blood heterogeneous classify two subset accord presence absence FcÎ³RIII receptor CD16 ( 9 ) : CD14++CD16- monocyte characterize high level expression CD14 cell surface receptor expression CD16 receptor , CD14+CD16+ monocytes characterize co-expression CD16 receptor either high low level expression CD14 receptor . These subset differ function response several cytokine . Our aim study find possible relationship level circulate monocyte subset coronary collateral development .</brief_summary>
