	<brief_summary>The principal morbidity follow axillary node dissection within scope breast cancer surgery post-operative development lymphocele . According literature , incidence vary 4 89 % depend type surgery , whether drain inserted compression dress applied time drain removed… In experience , incidence 40 % [ IGR ( Gustave Roussy Institute ) data focus 70 patient November 2008 February 2009 ] Encouraging result term reduce postoperative lymphoceles well drainage duration volume use Octreotide record two recent study . A new molecule develop Novartis Laboratories , namely pasireotide , somatostatin analog possess strong affinity several somatostatin receptor ( 30 40 time great sst1 sst5 , 5 time great sst3 equivalent sst2 ) The purpose trial ass efficacy pre-surgical injection pasireotide LAR reduce postoperative incidence symptomatic lymphoceles follow axillary node dissection . The secondary objective assess efficacy prolong release pasireotide duration postoperative drainage , daily drainage volume , total drainage volume , number repeat lymphocele aspiration volume , total volume lymph aspirate , incidence postoperative febrile episode , length hospital stay , length time onset adjuvant chemotherapy . It also assess safety prolong release pasireotide . The primary objective study assess efficacy preoperative prolonged release pasireotide injection reduction incidence symptomatic , postoperative axillary lymphoceles follow mastectomy-axillary node dissection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Octreotide , somatostatin analog , demonstrate efficacy medical management postoperative gastro-intestinal pancreatic fistula . Two recent study show value reduce lymphoceles follow axillary node dissection perform part breast cancer surgery . The principal morbidity follow axillary node dissection within scope breast cancer surgery postoperative development lymphocele follow removal axillary drain . This may source pain , repeat aspiration , infection delay local healing . Pasireotide , somatostatin analog evaluation possess high affinity somatostatine receptor ( 30 40 time great sst1 sst5 receptor , 5 time great sst3 equivalent sst2 ) attractive molecule indication . Based encouraging result publish octreotide great effect anticipate pasireotide , investigator want assess benefit preoperative administration pasireotide reduce incidence axillary lymphoceles follow mastectomy - axillary node dissection . Somatostatin hormone widely distribute nervous gastropancreatic system responsible variety pharmacological physiological effect . It inhibit gastrointestinal endocrine exocrine secretion anti-inflammatory action ( 1 ) . The direct effect somatostatin lymphatic flow observe gastrointestinal tract . Several series report use octreotide treatment chylous ascites management thoracic duct injury ( 2 ) . Although mechanism action study depth , probably act inhibit splanchnic blood flow limit absorption triglyceride . Somatostatin receptor demonstrate lymphatic tissue , include associate intestinal tract . It therefore probable inhibitory action somatostatin gastrointestinal lymphatic flow may also apply elsewhere body , lymphatic system particular . Somatostatin might therefore decrease lymphatic flow follow essentially axillary lymphadenectomy . A new molecule , pasireotide , currently clinical development . This molecule somatostatin analog possess affinity 30 40 time great sst1 sst5 receptor , 5 time great sst3 comparable sst2 octreotide . It could therefore great effect octreotide . The gradual release form must inject intramuscularly prior surgery . An effective plateau concentration obtain 10 day regardless select dosage ( 20 , 40 , 60 mg ) . In addition many article literature detail beneficial effect octreotide gastrointestinal pancreatic fistula regression chylous ascites chylothorax , article attempt highlight effect postoperative lymphoceles . Firstly , two article highlight positive effect somatostatin analog reduce drainage volume incidence lymphoceles follow axillary node dissection breast cancer : Another recent article Mahmoud et al . ( 5 ) show beneficial effect mean daily drainage volume ( 104 vs 145 ml , p=0.0001 ) , total duration drainage ( 12.7 vs 25 day , p=0.0001 ) need postoperative aspiration lymphoceles ( 90 vs 40 % , p=0.0001 ) . In 2006 , different field ( renal transplantation ) , article Capocasale et al.Pasireotide injectable somatostatin analog . Like natural somatostatin know analog , pharmaceutical efficacy depend bind somatostatin receptor . There five ( sst 1 5 ) ; express various bodily tissue normal physiological condition . Somatostatin analogs activate receptor , turn reduce cell activity inhibit hormone synthesis . ( 7 ) . Octreotide lanreotide , currently use , strong affinity sst2 receptor moderate affinity , , type . Pasireotide possess great affinity octreotide certain somatostatin receptor : 30 time great sst1 , 5 time great sst3 40 time great sst5 . It possess equivalent affinity sst2 none ( like octreotide ) sst4 . In literature , incidence axillary lymphoceles follow surgery breast cancer vary considerably : recent meta-analysis 66 study reveal incidence 4 89 % depend whether drainage carry , type surgery ( conservative ) , time drain remove whether compression dress apply . In experience , incidence Hôpital Tenon 40 % . This percentage corroborate Gustave Roussy Institute data , record incidence 39.3 % 70 patient underwent surgery November 2008 February 2009 . Several team report use Sandostatin® somatostatin analogs management patient suffer inoperable peritoneal carcinoma ( 9-12 ) . This treatment use supportive therapy reduce incidence symptom associate obstructive syndrome . It fact , reduce gastrointestinal secretion . Some author even suggest somatostatin analog possess anti-tumor effect ( 9 ) . Octreotide recommend AFSSAPS treatment palliative care patient present intestinal occlusion peritoneal carcinoma . Since Marketing Authorization ( MA ) grant use somatostatin analogs patient present gastrointestinal endocrine tumor , use pasireotide raise specific ethical issue .</detailed_description>
