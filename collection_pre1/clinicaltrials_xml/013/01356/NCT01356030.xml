	<brief_summary>The two commonly use method biopsy suspect pancreaticobiliary mass ( 1 ) endoscopic ultrasound guide fine-needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) ( 2 ) cytology brush biopsy obtain endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . At center , specific method use depend availability technology local expertise . Although believe EUS-FNA accurate ERCP brushing , head-to-head comparison . The investigator ' hypothesis EUS-FNA superior ERCP obtain tissue biopsy pancreaticobiliary tumor , investigator aim directly compare two technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Ultrasound Versus Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) Tissue Sampling Diagnosis Suspected Pancreatico-Biliary Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients pancreaticobiliary tumor usually present painless jaundice due bile duct obstruction . The standard clinical evaluation may include EUS and/or ERCP . At center EUS available ( like CPMC ) , usually use first generally consider well tool tumor detection , stag , perform biopsy ( FNA ) . ERCP perform , need , place stent relieve jaundice . As EUS relatively new technology widely disseminate , center use ERCP 1st modality evaluate suspect malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction . The role ERCP set place stent relieve jaundice , additionally obtain cytology brushing tissue diagnosis . Several study report high sensitivity EUS-FNA detecting pancreaticobiliary cancer cause bile duct obstruction jaundice ( 80-90 % ) . The sensitivity ERCP brushing biopsy detect type tumor reportedly low ( 30-80 % ) , direct comparison technique . Few center use technology ( EUS ERCP ) patient care , often perform EUS ERCP separate session . At CPMC , investigator routinely perform EUS ERCP together patient need procedure . Thus investigator unique position directly compare EUS-FNA ERCP brushing tissue diagnosis suspect pancreaticobiliary tumor . The propose study 1st direct comparison EUS-FNA ERCP tissue sample patient suspect pancreaticobiliary cancer . Study result highlight best approach obtain biopsy diagnosis pancreatic biliary tract cancer .</detailed_description>
