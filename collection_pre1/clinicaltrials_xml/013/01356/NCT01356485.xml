	<brief_summary>Sickle Cell Anemia cause inherited hemoglobin disorder . Healthy red blood cell discoid deform move small blood vessel carry oxygen part body . In sickle cell disease , red blood cell circulate oxygen release circulatory system , deoxygenate abnormal hemoglobin S begin polymerize . When occurs , red blood cell become sticky elongated . These sickled red blood cell less flexible obstruct small blood vessel block normal red blood cell travel circulatory system , limit oxygen delivery tissue organ . This know `` sickle crisis '' . Patients suffer sickle crisis experience severe pain risk stroke , heart attack even death . By lower level oxygen pressure sickling occurs open vasculature rapidly deliver oxygen directly ischemic tissue , addition MP4CO exist treatment protocol may alleviate pain associate sickle cell crisis , abort crisis and/or potentially reduce duration crisis . This could mean less time hospital improve quality life patient sickle cell anemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study MP4CO Adult Sickle Cell Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To date , specific agent approve treat sickle cell crisis , reduce severity sickling crisis , shorten duration admission . Current therapy sickling crisis limit hydration symptomatic pain relief opiates pain severe enough cause admission hospital . Administration oxygen inhalation alone proven effective . Carbon monoxide ( CO ) bind Hb S , attach , prevents reverse polymerization Hb S chain consequent distortion red blood cell . Carbon monoxide low dos also act messenger cell , reduce inflammation , reduce oxygen requirement , prevent program cell death ( apoptosis ) . The MP4 molecule modify carry CO gas enhance therapeutic benefit certain patient . MP4CO therefore design deliver therapeutic , non-toxic level CO , provide immediate metabolic signal cell reduce inflammation . Once CO release compound , MP4 molecule get oxygenate lung delivers oxygen ischemic tissue . Previously publish study provide good foundation postulate chemically modify hemoglobin MP4CO might ideal property oxygen therapeutic agent treatment reversal sickling crisis . The initial release CO MP4CO predict therapeutic effect include immediate stabilization Hb S prevent polymerization reverse exist sickling , vasodilation capillary , anti-inflammatory property . The subsequent circulation MP4 molecule oxygen therapeutic agent ( convert MP4OX follow oxygenation lung ) help 1 ) preferentially oxygenate ischemic cell , 2 ) reverse partially sickled red cell , 3 ) improve oxygenation local tissue , thereby potentially ameliorate painful VOC cause red blood cell sickling . In addition , MP4CO enhance chemical stability , enable storage room temperature minimize methemoglobin formation .</detailed_description>
