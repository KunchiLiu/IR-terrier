	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome ( SLOS ) . SLOS inherited condition cause body make enzyme . The body need enzyme help make cholesterol . SLOS cause many health problem include slow growth development , eat disorder , sleep disorder , behavior disorder , eye disease . Severe SLOS lead birth defect mental retardation many case early death . The investigator plan measure cholesterol sterol level , perform clinical observation , whole body test imaging ( brain MRIs ) , learn disease progression , difference clinical feature among individual SLOS , look effect cholesterol supplementation condition . The study interventional study characterize disease progression correlation clinical , biochemical physiological feature disease . The main hypothesis dietary cholesterol supplementation improve feature SLOS related brain ( e.g . IQ , behavior ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome ( SLOS ) disorder cholesterol synthesis , production . It cause mutation DHCR7 gene encode 7-dehydrocholesterol- Î”7-reductase , enzyme necessary production cholesterol body . Affected individual exhibit multiple malformation mental retardation . The feature SLOS think primarily relate cholesterol deficiency accumulation cholesterol precursor . However , clinical phenotype well characterize , biochemical pathogenesis incompletely understood , proven therapy devastate condition . Thus primary objective good define clinical biochemical phenotype disease use natural history study design . The study contribute create comprehensive SLOS patient registry , identify biomarkers use diagnostic testing , screen outcome measure future therapeutic trial . All patient SLOS receive dietary cholesterol supplementation hope cholesterol supplementation improve clinical manifestation disease . However , evidence support clinical benefit cholesterol supplementation . Thus secondary objective study determine cholesterol intake correlate change whole body cholesterol homeostasis clinical end-points .</detailed_description>
