	<brief_summary>Despite increase emphasis evidence base practice recent year gap remain evidence practice , particularly resource poor country . Few study date examine use knowledge translation strategy improve health care outcomes low income country . However , give majority health care setting provide worker less train limited resource , theoretical potential knowledge translation strategy improve health care delivery outcomes integrate best evidence routine practice may greatest setting . Knowledge translation ( KT ) approach change health care provider behavior reduce gap evidence practice health care delivery . There tendency knowledge translation intervention employ generic , `` shelf '' , strategy , apply deal specific issue . This generic approach , fail recognize variability specific characteristic health care setting , term patient population , health care system , health care provider . These characteristic , whether function barrier facilitator change , make generalized approach KT ineffective , tailor strategy , specifically adjust approach measure local barrier facilitator may achieve good alignment practice evidence . This likely particularly true low income country majority health care provide non-physician health care worker , work within wide range health care system , variable unique patient population resource constraint . Given potential significantly impact health care outcomes relatively low cost , research need develop method identify potential barrier facilitator KT strategy specific resource poor setting , evaluate effectiveness KT strategy tailor address identify barrier . This study assess effectiveness two part knowledge translation intervention tailor address factor identify previous study function barrier facilitator treatment adherence among patient treatment tuberculosis combine tuberculosis antiretroviral treatment , target improve patient adherence health outcome , specific low income country .</brief_summary>
