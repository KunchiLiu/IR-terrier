	<brief_summary>The study design randomise control trial trauma patient admit Royal Melbourne Hospital ( RMH ) Emergency Department ( ED ) subsequently transfer Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . Patients meet study inclusion criterion randomly allocate either control group receive usual pressure ulcer prevention strategy trial group receive usual care plus Mepilex Border Sacrum dress apply sacrum Mepilex Boarder Heel dress apply heel ED . Hypothesis : Patients treat Mepilex Border dressing low incidence rate sacral heel pressure ulcer development patient receive standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims To determine effectiveness Mepilex Border dressing prevent sacral heel pressure ulcer development To determine cost effectiveness Mepilex Border dressing prevent sacral heel pressure ulcer . Primary endpoint Incidence rate pressure ulcer ICU express total number pressure ulcer develop per week group Secondary endpoint Cost trial dressing prevent pressure ulcer Cost management develop pressure ulcer Hypothesis Patients treat Mepilex Border dressing low incidence rate sacral heel pressure ulcer development patient receive standard care . Subjects Sampling All trauma critically ill patient admit ED define ED trauma and/or critically ill . These patient subsequently transfer ICU six ( 6 ) month period commence January 2010 Sample size The investigator calculate detect decrease ICU pressure ulcer incidence rate 3.5 % ( 4 % 0.5 % ) intervention group power set 80 % alpha 0.05 require total 220 patient per group . Randomisation Subjects randomise either intervention group control group allocate subject study number use computer generate set random number determine group allocation . The randomisation participant undertaken ED research nurse patient admit ED follow screen determine meet inclusion criterion . Participant selection : The following procedure use ED Research Nurse determine person include study group individual allocate . Potential participant Meets inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion Conducts standard MH pressure ulcer risk screening ( Braden Scale ) Assigns participant study number Records ED data admission ( see ) Determines group allocation compare participant study number randomisation sequence If randomise trial group : Applies Mepilex Border dressing sacrum heel Records time dress application Intervention Trial group patient meet inclusion criterion Mepilex Border dress apply sacrum heel admission ED ED research nursing staff . It necessary apply dress point investigator wish investigate potential protective effect dress patient need surgical procedure may involve long period OR . Mepilex Border Dressing Mepilex Border absorbent , atraumatic self-adhesive island dress perforate soft silicone wound contact layer . The absorbent core dressing consist three component , thin sheet polyurethane foam , piece nonwoven fabric layer superabsorbent polyacrylate fibre . The core locate centrally upon large piece polyurethane film hold place perforate silicone adhesive layer extend out margin dress . This gentle adhesion also tend prevent maceration inhibit lateral movement exudate wound surround skin . The silicone layer adhere surface wound therefore dress may remove without cause pain trauma . Method use The wound contact surface dress protect divided plastic film , must remove use . If clinically indicate , wound clean surround skin thoroughly dry application dressing . If additional fixation require apply around margin dress . Frequency Change The interval change normally determine amount exudate produce wound , dress may leave place several day clean non-infected wound . The manufacturer note absolute contra-indications use Mepilex Border dressing . As patient study wound area dress applied investigator propose change dressing every three day require become soiled dislodged . This decision make member research team whao involve daily assessment patient . The skin dressing observe daily member research team determine pressure relate injury develop . Pressure related injury define per Australian Wound management Association clinical guideline prediction , prevention management pressure ulcer . All member research team undergo inter-rater reliability test September 2010 ability recognise stage pressure ulcer . Measurement Patient demographic Age Wt Gender Race Pre-existing disease Charlson Comorbidity Index score Reason admission Management pre admission Eg . Time spinal board Time Ambulance Time ED ED management - ventilation ED physiological observation Number OR procedure Time OR Time ICU Nutritional status Immobility Urinary incontinence Faecal incontinence Pressure ulcer : Pressure ulcer incidence per week Pressure ulcer stag accord Australian Wound Management Association ( AWMA ) stag system Cost trial dressing use total duration trial Cost management develop pressure ulcer Staff time Consumables Physiological data All physiological data collect ICU Shock/SIRS Cardiac arrest Drive line Spinal cord injury Mechanical ventilation Traction/external fixators Pharmaceutical data All drug Sedation/Paralytics Vasopressor drug Analysis A survival analysis use determine difference pressure ulcer incidence rate per group logistic regression use investigate potential interaction demographic physiological variable group incidence rate . Analysis conduct separately sacral heel wound main analysis . The investigator may pool result appear difference incidence rate sacral heel wound . All analytical procedure carry Statistical Consulting Centre , University Melbourne . Cost analysis involve calculate total treatment prevention cost associated pressure ulcer include staff time consumables . The cost analysis carry research nurse ICU observe record total staff time grade RN spent pressure ulcer prevention patient . Costs support surface ( dynamic mattress overlay ) also add prevention cost . Intervention group patient also cost Mepilex Border dress added pressure ulcer prevention cost . Should patient either group develop pressure ulcer cost manage wound calculate base staff time grade , consumables dressing , investigation microbiological specimen collection analysis . These cost determine total time patient remain ICU .</detailed_description>
