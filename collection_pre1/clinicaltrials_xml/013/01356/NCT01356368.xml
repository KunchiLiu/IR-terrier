	<detailed_description>The treatment advance NSCLC cancer include various chemotherapy equivalent regimen reach therapeutic plateau . The selection regimens completely empirical physician dependent . Potential predictor specific agent efficacy exist form tumor molecular marker reflection individual 's genetic make . Thus study aim utilize marker efficiently select regimen order maximize benefit patient rather use empiric approach . Fortunately , select regimen contains active well-studied agent treatment lung cancer ( Table 1 ) . This pilot study help u determine benefit , safety approach ( individual regimen ) . The study compare individual regimen aim test whole concept customization chemotherapy base molecular marker help u future select regimen base marker empirically . The result use determine definitive future study . Furthermore , circulate tumor cell blood represent future distant metastases result disease progression incurable stage . The circulate tumor cell ability cross vessel , travel circulation , exit vessel tissue capability grow . Therefore , cell may express different biological molecular feature stationary cell primary tumor . Therefore , exploit circulate tumor cell augment treatment approach vital importance utility .</detailed_description>
