	<brief_summary>Quality-controlled commercial medium use many in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) laboratory . However , commercial medium costly difficult compare directly exact composition clearly indicate . Although commercially available medium commonly use IVF program worldwide , several advantage use in-house synthetic sequential medium IVF laboratory . First , result quality control reliable due stringent protocol setting-up . Second , direct supplementation deletion specific component feasible obtain good quality embryos high pregnancy rate since component define . Finally , dependence commercially available medium diminishes laboratory easily accommodate unexpected situation problem , sudden increase IVF patient . Therefore , present study conduct compare efficacy in-house MRC medium human IVF-embryo transfer ( ET ) program commercially available medium .</brief_summary>
