	<brief_summary>Patients chronic kidney disease profound exercise intolerance contributes increase risk cardiovascular disease . The investigator find chronic kidney disease patient exaggerated increase blood pressure certain form exercise could certainly contribute exercise dysfunction well cardiovascular risk . The investigator test mechanism underlie exaggerated blood pressure response , well potential benefit short-term tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) folic acid exercise dysfunction cardiovascular risk factor chronic kidney disease . The investigator test whether short-term treatment tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) , cofactor nitric oxide , together folic acid improve inflammation , vascular health , adrenaline level , rest exercise chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>
