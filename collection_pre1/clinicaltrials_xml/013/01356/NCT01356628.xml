	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 Study PD-0332991 treatment patient Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) , type adenocarcinoma common type liver tumor . PD-0332991 compound stop tumor cell enter Synthesis phase cell cycle , therefore stop DNA multiplication decrease tumor cell copying .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Research Study Determine Whether PD 0332991 May Be Effective Treating Patients With Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common cancer worldwide third frequent cause cancer-related mortality . To date , surgical resection liver transplantation consider main curative treatment option HCC ( El-Serag et al . 2006 ) . However , majority ( ~75 % ) patient present advanced tumor stage poor liver function , render patient ineligible surgical intervention . Until multikinase inhibitor sorafenib ( Nexavar ) approve treatment HCC patient unresectable disease ( disease ca n't remove surgery ) , standard systemic therapy , classical cell kill drug ( administer singularly combination ) lead reproducible response rate survival benefit . Despite , response rate sorafenib low overall benefit modest , moreover toxicity profile drug limit treatment many patient . There still critical need additional effective drug treat advance HCC . PD-0332991 orally available , selective inhibitor cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 ( CDK4/6 ) , key regulator cell growth . Pre-clinical data PD-0332991 demonstrate potent target-specificity . PD-0332991 demonstrate significant inhibition tumor cell growth hepatoma cell line , well animal xenograft model system , effective currently approve drug , sorafenib system . Initial clinical trial demonstrate acceptable toxicity profile drug . Thus , PD-0332991 represent ideal candidate treatment patient advance HCC . This trial open-label non-randomized single-institution study subject inoperable , recurrent/refractory , advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Subjects must fail intolerant standard first line therapy , sorafenib ( Nexavar® ) . Eligible subject receive 125 mg PD-0332991 capsule orally daily , administered day 1-21 28-day cycle , repeat cycle . The primary objective study assess time disease progression ( TTP ) . Secondary objective include assessment safety tolerability , determination overall survival ( OS ) response rate ( RR ) . Subjects permit receive protocol direct therapy disease progression determine modified RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) guideline clinical progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent death . Tumor response assessment perform Investigator consist evaluation CT MRI every 8 week . Subjects discontinue therapy still follow safety Day 28 ( ± 3 day ) , Day 56 ( ± 3 day ) every 3 month thereafter last administration protocol-directed therapy death . Subjects continuously assessed evidence acute cumulative toxicity . Vital sign , physical examination , performance status , laboratory safety test obtain assessed prior drug administration regular interval throughout study . Toxicity evaluate every 2 week first 3 cycle thereafter monthly ( per cycle ) Investigator accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) , Version 4.0 .</detailed_description>
