	<brief_summary>Psoriasis common inflammatory disease skin joint prevalence 1-3 % caucasian population Northern Europe US . Similarly inflammatory disease substantial accumulate evidence psoriasis systemic inflammatory component . It known patient suffer psoriasis increase prevalence traditional cardiovascular risk factor , hypertension , dyslipidaemia , obesity , tobacco use diabetes mellitus . This would logically explain increased rate cardiovascular event , even adjust thesis risk factor , psoriasis carry independent risk develop cardiovascular disease . Recent large epidemiological study show strong correlation psoriasis myocardial infarction . Atopic dermatitis link ischemic stroke one study , besides , disease associate cardiovascular disease . In conclusion , convince increase evidence support psoriasis induce accelerate atherosclerosis hence cardiovascular disease mortality . In particular , see young patient early disease onset . Psoriasis believe driven cytokine produce Th1 Th17 lymphocytes . A number cytokine suggest atherogenic . In contrast , another chronic inflammatory disease , atopic dermatitis , predominantly drive Th2 lymphocyte derive cytokine , may inhibit atherosclerotic process . It therefore , interest compare presence cardiovascular disease two inflammatory skin disease . Hypothesis : That risk develop cardiovascular disease especially coronary artery disease increase psoriasis patient process influence treatment psoriasis biological treatment .</brief_summary>
