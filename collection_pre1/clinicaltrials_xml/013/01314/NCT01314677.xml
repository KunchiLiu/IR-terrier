	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) predict chemoradiation therapy ( CRT ) failure patient stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Diagnostic procedure , FDG PET/CT , may help predict CRT failure . Comparing diagnostic result CRT may help doctor predict patient 's response treatment help plan best treatment</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET/CT Scans Predicting Therapy Response Patients With Stage IIIA Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Undergoing Chemoradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether early response research positron emission tomography ( PET ) -computed tomography ( CT ) scan measure change Standard Uptake Value ( SUV ) max relative baseline scan predict induction chemoradiation therapy ( CRT ) failures sooner post-treatment PET-CT scan . II . To determine optimal time 18FDG PET-CT best predicts induction CRT failure . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate early 18 fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) PET-CT response metric pathologic response , progression-free survival separately : induction CRT failures vs. non-failures , overall survival separately induction CRT failure vs. non-failures . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 group . Patients undergo baseline FDG PET/CT scan receive standard radiotherapy ( RT ) 28 fraction concurrent chemotherapy . GROUP A : Patients undergo FDG PET/CT scan RT fraction 5-6 ( course 2 chemotherapy ) . GROUP B : Patients undergo FDG PET/CT scan RT fraction 10-11 ( course 3 chemotherapy ) . GROUP C : Patients undergo FDG PET/CT scan RT fraction 15-16 ( course 4 chemotherapy ) . Approximately 6 week completion CRT , patient undergo FDG PET/CT scan undergo standard tumor resection . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
