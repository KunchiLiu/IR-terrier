	<brief_title>Efficacy Bevacizumab Preventing Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) extreme form acute lung injury ( ALI ) result loss lung function structure . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , protein critical lung development find thin layer liquid lining inner surface lung air sac , believe play key role development ARDS . During ARDS/ALI , VEGF markedly increase permeability cell line inner surface blood vessel lung , lead accumulation fluid lung ( pulmonary edema ) , characteristic ARDS/ALI . Thus , anti-VEGF therapy offer unique approach treat potentially fatal disorder . Bevacizumab ( Avastin Â® ) , anti-VEGF medication , show effective inhibiting pulmonary edema cause VEGF over-expression animal model . This study establish usefulness effectiveness singe dose Bevacizumab administer intravenously ( vein ) reduce incidence ARDS individual severe sepsis ( condition characterize inflammatory response immune system throughout whole body cause infection ) high risk development ARDS . All study participant randomize receive placebo , bevacizumab 5 mg/kg bevacizumab 10 mg/kg single intravenous dose double-blinded fashion addition traditional sepsis treatment .</detailed_description>
