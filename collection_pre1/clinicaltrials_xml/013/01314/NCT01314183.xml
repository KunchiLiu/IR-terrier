	<brief_summary>The overall aim project examine clinical cost-effectiveness utilizing booster session ( periodic face-to-face follow-up appointment take place several week month follow discharge supervised therapy program design review patient 's current rehabilitation program , troubleshoot problem program , make recommendation program progression modification ) delivery exercise therapy , supplement exercise therapy manual therapy technique ( manually apply treatment technique joint mobilization/manipulation , manual traction , soft tissue manipulation , passive stretching range motion ) . The investigator randomize , multi-center , clinical trial . The investigator hypothesize add manual therapy technique clinically effective exercise alone use booster session maintain long term clinical effect cost-effective use booster session .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Effectiveness Physical Therapy People With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise therapy ( ET ) effective first line treatment reduce pain disability patient knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) , study show effect diminish considerably time . 'Booster ' intervention session ( periodic face-to-face follow-up appointment follow discharge supervise therapy design review progress patient 's home program , troubleshoot problem program , etc . ) recommend make beneficial effect endure however recommendation adequately test . There also indication manual therapy ( MT ) , manually apply treatment technique joint mobilization/manipulation , manual traction , soft tissue manipulation , passive stretching , combine ET , may improve overall effectiveness rehabilitation reduce pain disability , , may significantly delay reduce need total knee arthroplastic surgery reduce medication intake people knee OA . However , current publish evidence-based treatment guideline indicate enough data make definitive recommendation regard use MT ET rehabilitation program . Therefore , overall aim project examine clinical cost-effectiveness utilizing booster session delivery ET , supplement ET MT techniques.The study multi-center , randomize clinical trial , use 2 x 2 factorial design ( factor 1 = booster v booster , factor 2 = ET alone vs ET + MT ) . Three hundred subject ( 100 per study site ) knee OA randomize one follow group : 1 ) ET - booster , 2 ) ET - booster , 3 ) MT + ET - booster session , 4 ) MT + ET - booster session . Clinical outcome measure ( WOMAC , knee pain , global rating change performance-based measure function ) take baseline ( prior randomization ) , completion initial therapy session ( 9 week ) 1 year follow-up . The primary endpoint clinical outcome WOMAC 1 year.For cost effectiveness analysis , primary cost outcome osteoarthritis treatment cost societal perspective , include health system cost implement intervention , medical/surgical cost ( primary , secondary , tertiary care cost ) , personal cost participant ( travel , non-funded medication , time work , quality-of-life burden ) . The primary effectiveness outcome measure quality-adjusted life-years ( QALYs ) , derive use quality life utility EQ-5D score . Cost effectiveness value intervention compare via incremental cost-effectiveness ratio , yield incremental cost per QALY gain give intervention chosen . Secondary analysis examine cost-effectiveness health system patient perspective . Cost effectiveness data obtain 1 year 2 year follow-ups . The 2 year follow-up primary endpoint cost-effectiveness analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>40 year age old Meet American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) clinical criterion diagnosis knee OA . The ACR clinical criterion knee OA include knee pain plus 3 follow 6 criterion : age &gt; 50 year , morning stiffness &lt; 30 minute , crepitus active movement , tenderness bony margin joint , bony enlargement joint note exam , lack palpable warmth synovium . Based criterion , subject less 50 year knee pain 3 5 criterion would also classify knee OA . meet ACR clinical criterion knee OA , schedule total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) surgery , undergone TJA surgery low extremity joint , exhibit uncontrolled hypertension ( i.e . individual currently take medication hypertension whose systolic blood pressure great 140 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure great 90 mm Hg rest ) , complaint low back pain low extremity joint pain affect function time recruitment , history neurological disorder would affect low extremity function ( stroke , peripheral neuropathy , parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis , etc . ) , woman pregnant .</criteria>
