	<brief_title>Therapy Overactive Bladder Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The treatment patient OAB clinical practice often consist drug therapy combination bladder training and/or behavioural therapy whole body vibration training ( WBVT ) pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) . However , little data exist benefit combination . In particular , data association antimuscarinic agent WBVT PFMT . In order optimize treatment OAB great importance conduct study compare pharmacotherapy alone combination pharmacotherapy behavioural technique . The aim present study investigate patient OABS whether combination treatment solifenacin pelvic floor muscle train whole body vibration train achieves well treatment outcome treatment solifenacin alone . At baseline visit subject randomise 2 treatment arm . Patients randomize group A receive solifenacin 5mg tablet daily training programme PFMT WBVT week . Subjects randomise group B receive solifenacin 5mg tablet daily . Efficacy evaluation take place week 8 16 . Safety evaluation take place visit . At week 8 , discussion investigator , patient option continue original dose request dose increase base satisfaction efficacy tolerability .</detailed_description>
