	<detailed_description>Introduction : Lowe syndrome ( LS ) , also know oculocerebrorenal syndrome Lowe ( OCRL ) , rare X-linked condition characterize congenital cataract , defective renal tubule cell function , muscular hypotonia variable degree mental retardation . Patients LS require frequent surgery , associate severe haemorrhagic risk , scoliosis reduction , hip surgery , eye surgery . In recent retrospective clinical survey French LS patient , observe abnormal rate haemorrhagic event , dramatic outcome . LS cause BYMUTATIONS OCRL gene , encode OCRL , inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase . The preferred OCRLsubstrate membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate ( PtdIns ( 4,5 ) P2 ) . OCRL also contain Rho GTPase-activating protein ( GAP ) -like domain participates regulation Rho protein ( Rho , Rac , Cdc42 ) , GTPase-activating protein mediate protein-protein interaction . PtdIns ( 4,5 ) P2 Rho-dependent signalling play central role many important cellular process , include vesicular trafficking cytoskeletal organization important platelet function . Thus , modulation PtdIns ( 4,5 ) P2 level and/or Rho-dependent signalling would expect impact platelet function . Based clinical observation , test whether hemorrhagic symptom 6 Lowe patient could relate homeostasis abnormality find six patient prolonged closure time test PFA100 analyzer ( Platelet Function Analyzer ) . These result measure absence interfere factor anemia , thrombopenia , von Willebrand factor deficiency , thus suggest platelet dysfunction . Study justification : The comprehension physiopathology implicate abnormal hemorrhagic risk major interest term prevention clinical management Lowe patient require frequent surgical care . Objectives : The main objective study confirm presence platelet dysfunction Lowe syndrome characterize abnormality . The secondary aim settle functional test allow detection patient increase hemorrhagic risk . Moreover , could determinate whether platelet interest cellular model , easily available , OCRL1 study Lowe patient . Methods : We investigate platelet activation response 15 Lowe case 15 normal case . The evaluation criterion include PFA100 , THROMBOELASTOMETRY ( ROTEM ) , aggregation , secretion , adhesion flux system clot retraction . We also compare molecular ( phospho-proteins , phospholipid ... ) structural modification non activate platelet activate platelet . Conclusion : The characterization platelet activation abnormality Lowe patient could lead major benefit patient systematic homeostasis screen special precaution rule surgery , often required multisystemic condition . Moreover , study could contribute go PI ( 4,5 ) P2 signal pathway may provide clue interrelationship process normal metabolism diseases state .</detailed_description>
