	<detailed_description>Glaucoma lead cause blindness US . Traditional method glaucoma diagnosis monitoring lack good sensitivity specificity . Delays detect glaucoma progression lead inadequate treatment irreversible visual loss . Our goal improve glaucoma diagnosis utilize new image modality reveal change retinal layer affect glaucoma associate reduction retinal blood flow . Glaucoma selectively damage retinal nerve fiber , originate cell body ganglion cell layer ( GCL ) travel optic nerve via nerve fiber layer ( NFL ) . We hypothesize subtle damage structure detect earlier optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) advance image modality current standard method . OCT base infrared light reflectometry . It provide micrometer-scale cross-sectional image retinal structure , possible non-invasive technique . More 7,000 OCT system already use diagnosis glaucoma retinal disease . Phase I Advanced Imaging Glaucoma ( AIG ) study demonstrate peripapillary NFL thickness measure standard timedomain ( TD ) OCT technology high glaucoma diagnostic accuracy quantitative diagnostic technology scan laser polarimetry ( SLP ) scan laser tomography ( SLT ) . We also demonstrate advanced diagnostic software faster Fourier-domain ( FD ) OCT system achieve even well diagnostic accuracy reproducibility . In proposed Phase II AIG study , continue promise aspect research improve technology clinical practice . The AIG Partnership investigator Oregon Health &amp; Science University ( OHSU ) , Massachusetts Institute Technology ( MIT ) , University Pittsburgh ( UP ) include invent OCT pioneer application glaucoma . OHSU , University Southern California ( USC ) , UP University Miami ( UM ) also major glaucoma referral center . The Partnership combine engineer clinician track record synergy develop novel technology , evaluate rigorous clinical study , transfer knowledge industry medicine . The Specific Aims compete renewal proposal : 1 . Develop image processing diagnostic analysis 3-dimensional OCT data . The AIG study currently use 26 kHz ( axial scan repetition rate ) FD-OCT technology capable scan macula optic nerve head fraction second . We complete computer algorithm map analysis macular ganglion cell complex ( mGCC ) peripapillary NFL , lead significant improvement diagnostic accuracy . We propose continue work disc cup analysis , NFL reflectivity analysis , expert system combination multiple anatomic parameter improve diagnostic accuracy . Algorithms detect progression glaucoma time also plan . 2 . Develop ultrafast OCT system image macula optic nerve head . Although current FD-OCT technology 26 kHz represent tremendous advance standard 400 Hz TD-OCT ( Zeiss Stratus ) , still take ~4 second full 3-dimensional ( 3D ) raster scan macula . Our goal reduce time 0.1-0.2 second 3D scan minimally affect eye movement . This require ultrafast speed 500-1000 kHz . We plan adapt Fourier-domain modelocked-laser ( FDML ) swept-source OCT , already demonstrate 249 kHz MIT . We improve speed 500 kHz . The short integration time phase stability FDML-OCT ideal Doppler perfusion measurement ( see next aim ) . For even fast speed , parallel line-scan FD-OCT 1 MHz develop . Line-scan OCT suitable Doppler flow measurement due relatively long integration time , efficient ultrafast anatomic imaging . It allow full 8x8 mm macular 3D image 0.2 second . We also continue develop polarization-sensitive ( PS ) OCT NFL birefringence measurement , also greatly enhance high speed great average suppress noise . 3 . Develop Doppler OCT measure retinal perfusion . One significant achievement AIG project demonstration reproducible method measure total retinal blood flow use Doppler FD-OCT . Reduced flow find glaucomatous eye , open important new approach measure severity glaucoma ass risk progression . An automated algorithm develop improve robustness Doppler flow measurement . We also investigate Doppler OCT ultrafast FDML-OCT system . 4 . Evaluate OCT technologies longitudinal clinical study . An extension ongoing clinical study propose . Participants ( 1000 plan 700+ already enrol ) normal , glaucoma suspect , glaucoma group follow . OCT image technology compare diagnostic accuracy , detection early progression , prediction future visual field loss . The impact intraocular pressure retinal blood flow flow affect risk glaucoma also study . Quantitative imaging technology OCT improve glaucoma management reduce reliance insensitive test perimetry subjective disc grading . The AIG Partnership comprise engineer clinician co-invented OCT. We propose improve performance high speed , sophisticated software , novel functional measurement . The eventual goal save vision base glaucoma treatment decision speedy reliable imaging test .</detailed_description>
