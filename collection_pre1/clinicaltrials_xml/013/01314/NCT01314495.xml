	<brief_title>Abatacept Costimulatory Blockade Treatment Alopecia Totalis/Universalis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alopecia Areata common autoimmune disease , affect 1 % general population result autoimmune attack hair follicle usually present patchy hair loss . One third patient experience spontaneous remission within first year . However many patient develop wax wan disease progress alopecia totalis ( total scalp hair loss ) alopecia universalis ( loss body hair ) . This population suffer disfigure disease represent significant unmet medical need . Alopecia totalis/universalis seldom , ever , remit spontaneously current treatment classify FDA Orphan Indication . There FDA approve drug alopecia areata . A recent Cochrane report conclude evidence base support intervention disease . Standard care remain observation mild disease lesional/oral steroid advance case . Abatacept soluble human fusion protein selectively modulate costimulatory signal require full T-cell activation . It approve treatment moderately severely active rheumatoid arthritis . It also approve treatment moderately severely active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis child 6 year age old . Abatacept lyophilize powder administer 30 minute intravenous infusion . Dosage , rheumatoid arthritis , weight base fix throughout course treatment . Abatacept placebo administer 30 minute intravenous infusion baseline , week 2 , 4 , every 4 week 5 cycle ( week 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 ) total treatment period 6 month .
