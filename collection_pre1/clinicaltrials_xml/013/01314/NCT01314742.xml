	<brief_summary>The goal pilot study test hypothesis mechanically ventilate infant receive Biotene OralBalance® gel oral care would reduce intubation time compare infant receive oral care placebo . This study also perform test feasibility well safety Biotene OralBalance® gel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Biotene OralBalance Gel Oral Care Critically-Ill Mechanically Ventilated Neonates</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prolonged mechanical ventilation know risk factor strongly associate ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) . As fatality rate VAP high , prevention VAP focus use `` VAP bundle '' . Oral decontamination , reduce microbial burden within patient 's oral cavity , essential part VAP bundle strategy reduce VAP rate mechanically ventilate adult old child . However publish study oral care product VAP prevention mechanically ventilated neonate . Biotene OralBalance® gel contain antibacterial active ingredient , include lactoperoxidase , lysozyme lactoferrin , enzymes bacteriostatic bactericidal activity selective oral microflora . We hypothesize directly reduce oral microbial burden , indirectly reduce number VAP . This reflect reduced time mechanical ventilation group infant receive Biotene OralBalance® gel . This prospective , randomize , unmasked , control trial 40 mechanically ventilated infant recruit level IV nursery Forsyth Medical Center , Winston-Salem , NC . The participant randomize two equal group , stratify gestational age category : &lt; 28 week , &gt; =28 week well multiple birth . Twenty infant receive Biotene OralBalance® gel ( Intervention Group ) 20 infant receive swab sterile water ( Control Group ) time oral care . Both study group receive NICU standard ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) bundle , combination strategy aim reduce rate VAP .</detailed_description>
