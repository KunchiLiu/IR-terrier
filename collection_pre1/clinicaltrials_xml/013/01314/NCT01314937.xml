	<brief_summary>Worldwide , 2 billion people suffer worm infection develop country . These infection especially damage health child , result short-term lifelong disability . Older child worm infection likely stunt , underweight , vulnerable illness perform poorly school compare non-infected child . Large-scale deworming program school-age child therefore recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) . WHO also recommend deworming preschool-age child ( 12 month age ) area ; however , benefit deworming , especially 12-24 month age group , inadequately study . This knowledge urgently need study show child similar potential healthy growth development , provide appropriate nutrition health intervention give critical window opportunity age two . Therefore , investigator propose undertake randomize control trial determine effect deworming program improve growth development child 12 24 month age . Our result provide solid rigorous evidence , , often , deworming integrate routine child health care package provide Ministries Health 130 country world worm infection endemic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Deworming Intervention Improve Early Childhood Growth Development Resource-poor Areas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide , 2 billion people suffer worm infection ( hookworm , Ascaris Trichuris , collectively refer soil-transmitted helminth ( STHs ) ) develop country . STHs contribute overwhelm burden poverty deprivation area adverse health , social , economic , education related factor predominate . STH infection childhood result short-term lifelong disability , include malnutrition ( e.g . underweight , stunt waste ) , cognitive impairment increase susceptibility infection , among others . Mass deworming program school-age child recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) . WHO also recommend deworming preschool child ( 12 month age ) endemic area ; however , benefit deworming improve growth development , especially 12-24 month age group , inadequately study . This knowledge crucial , appropriate nutrition health intervention , child similar potential healthy growth development , provide intervention occur critical window opportunity age two . Therefore , double-blind randomize controlled trial ass benefit deworming ( mebendazole ) , integrate routine child health care visit highly STH-endemic area ( Iquitos , Peru ) , primary outcome weight gain . Timing , frequency impact deworming consider . A total 1760 child recruit routine 12-month check-up visit randomly assign one four intervention group : Group 1 receive usual care mebendazole ( single dose 500 mg ) 12-month visit usual care placebo tablet 18-month visit ; Group 2 receive usual care placebo tablet 12-month visit usual care mebendazole 18-month visit ; Group 3 receive usual care mebendazole 12-month 18-month visit ; Group 4 receive usual care placebo 12-month 18-month visit . Usual care consist age-appropriate immunization , supplement Peruvian Ministry Health-recommended intervention . All child follow 24-month visit give mebendazole time . Additional secondary outcome include length gain , motor cognitive development STH prevalence intensity . Improving child health priority area global health research focus Millennium Development Goals . Early preschool-age child critical stage growth development neglect deworming program . It anticipate result inform evidence-based policy provision integrate health package young child endemic area ultimately contribute reduction health inequity vulnerable group .</detailed_description>
