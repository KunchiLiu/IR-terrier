PROTOCOL SUMMARY Title : 3D record trans-rectal prostate biopsy Device : Navigo™ Study Objectives : 1 ) To record trans-rectal biopsy procedure include initial scan needle biopsy location 2 ) To modulate 3D model prostate accurately display location various biopsy take procedure Study Design : Open prospective study . Recruitment target : 50 patient Study Population : Patients undergo trans-rectal prostate biopsy Study endpoint : Accurate 3D model prostate biopsy procedure Principal Investigator Co-operating Company Sponsor : Dr. Michael Cohen UC-CARE . Yokneam , Israel 2 . INTRODUCTION Prostate biopsy perform multiple consecutive biopsy needle insertion prostate gland trans-rectal ultrasound probe guidance . The needle insert designated needle guide ultrasound probe , rectum wall prostate gland . Today , perform physician navigates needle use momentary 2D ultrasound image ( longitudinal transverse B mode ) without record full prostate boundary previous biopsy ' location . By record procedure Navigo™ system generate display off-line accurate 3D model prostate position biopsy take prostatic volume . 3 . OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE 3.1 Study objective 1 ) To record trans-rectal biopsy procedure include initial scan needle biopsy location 2 ) To modulate 3D model prostate accurately display location various biopsy take procedure 3.2 Rationale The Navigo™ system noninvasive system allow physician accurately record biopsy procedure without change image system , biopsy routine technique use today scan guide biopsy needle insertion . The ability create accurate 3D model prostate accurately position biopsy needle location allow perform physician precise navigation easy accurate biopsy within prostate volume enable good analysis procedure pathological result , hence improve clinical outcome intend therapy surveillance ( i.e.- prepare follow-up biopsy procedure need ) . 4 . DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND INTENDED USE The Navigo™ system comprise two main element : standard laptop computer digitizer input record incoming video input ( ultrasound system ) , electro-magnetic 3D track system . The 3D track system connect via USB laptop computer , transmitter place beneath patient 's mattress two sensor attach , - one ultrasound probe ( base/ non invasive part probe ) patient 's back . The Navigo™ system track record location ultrasound probe incoming video ultrasound system . The patient 's movement record compensate ultrasound image place reference . In post procedure , physician defines boundary prostate select ultrasound image 3D model prostate display record biopsy specimen ' location display prostatic volume . The physician able examine post analysis scatter quality biopsy specimens prostatic volume update pathology result . The 3D model rotate , manipulate display physician 's preferable choice . The Navigo™ system intend record display 3D biopsy procedure patient undergo prostate trans-rectal biopsy . The Navigo™ system intend record data initial scan , volume measurement , biopsy needle insertion . All image save review post analysis , needle location update accord physician 's marking record ultrasound image pathology result display color 3D model . 5 . METHODS AND PROCEDURES 5.1 Study Design The study open prospective study - Examination procedure : The trans-rectal ultrasound guide prostate biopsy procedure conduct change ever currently conduct procedure . The exception normal procedure addition flat transmitter patient mattress , 2 external attach sensor record procedure via video-out put ultrasound use Navigo™ system . The 3D model compare record ultrasound image physician - The record data process off-line ( post biopsy /off-line analysis ) . - The analysis result complete post procedure physician . 5.2 Trial Procedure - A short one-time calibration Navigo™ system ultrasound system complete trained technician ( UC-CARE 's technician ) - The transmitter place beneath patient 's mattress body sensor attach patient ' back use regular disposable medical sticker . - The trans-rectal ultrasound probe hold physician control throughout procedure accord exist current biopsy protocol , without alteration . - The common ultrasound video output connect video input Navigo™ system - Patient 's identification fill allow proper post examination analysis - Following initial scan prostate volume measurement Navigo™ system record data store post analysis - In 3D biopsy screen 3D model prostate display record needle biopsy location record procedure . - The pathology result load Navigo™ system display 3D model 6 . SUBJECT POPULATION SELECTION 6.1 Inclusion Criteria • Eligibility - - Age 18 year old - Planned trans-rectal prostate biopsy - Signed informed consent 6.2 Exclusion criterion - Patient 's unwilling participate - Patients metal prosthetics 7 . POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO SUBJECTS No immediate benefit expect gained subject participate study 3D modeling display complete post procedure . The procedure carry exactly would without Navigo™ system participate biopsy procedure . The post procedure 3D model display biopsy specimen 's location may enable good data analysis . 8 . POTENTIAL RISKS TO SUBJECTS The Navigo™ system passive system require change procedure perform today . The various component come direct contact patient physician computer 3D tracking system well within require safety protocol . The Navigo system approve CE . The 3D tracking system approve FDA medical use classify Type CF stringent classification , require application applied part direct conductive contact heart application consider necessary . The 3D tracking system also part approve Helsinki trial Bnei-zion hospital ( monitor birth progress , trial initiate Dr. Yoav Paltieli ) Adverse effect expect accord accumulate experience 3D tracking system . Similarly , Navigo™ system expect add procedure pain discomfort patient . 9 . SUBJECT RECUITMENT Study population recruit pool patient schedule trans-rectal biopsy procedure 10 . DATA ANALYSIS The data analysis include follow step : • Post procedure display prostate 's 3D model location various biopsy specimen take procedure prostatic volume • Comparison result physician analysis specimen location derive image 11 .
