	<detailed_description>Smoking enormous public health problem great need research improve treatment outcomes . Our prior data indicate cytochrome P450 2A6 ( CYP2A6 ) enzyme critical metabolic inactivation nicotine , also influence smoke behavior response therapy . With vision toward translation research practice , characterize genetically-informed biomarker CYP2A6 activity , specifically nicotine metabolite ratio ( NMR ; 3'hydroxycotinine/cotinine ) , reflect CYP2A6 genetic variation environmental influence CYP2A6 activity . The NMR measure non-invasively smoker establish reliability , stability , analytic validity , efficacy predictor ability quit smoke treatment response multiple retrospective trial . Translation find clinical practice require validation prospective clinical trial compare alternative therapy smoke cessation . Thus , propose trial prospective , stratify , placebo-controlled , multi-center clinical trial alternative therapy smoke cessation treatment approximately 1,200 smoker . Randomization placebo ( PLA ) , transdermal nicotine ( TN ) , varenicline ( VAR ) stratify prospectively base nicotine metabolite ratio ( NMR ) . Abstinence smoke end treatment primary outcome . Quit rate 6-month follow-up secondary outcome . To facilitate translation practice , analysis cost-effectiveness propose approach also complete . The propose research provide next critical step validate genetically-informed diagnostic tool , NMR , clinician use future optimize treatment decision patient wish quit smoking .</detailed_description>
