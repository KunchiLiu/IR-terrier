	<brief_summary>Study Hypothesis : The peri-operative enteral administration proprietary immune-enhancing feed ( IMPACT ) reduce post-operative infective complication patient undergo major surgery squamous cell carcinoma Head neck ( SCCHN ) . Patients present SCCHN surgery recommend treatment , assume fulfill eligibility criterion , block randomise two-group , double-blind randomise control trial . One group receive IMPACT , iso-caloric , iso-nitrogenous control fee 5 day pre 7 day post-operatively . In group patient feed enterally . The feed prepare identical bottle facilitate blinding . Primary outcome measure include major systemic infection , whilst secondary outcome measure include local infection length hospital stay . Follow-up 30 day postsurgery .</brief_summary>
