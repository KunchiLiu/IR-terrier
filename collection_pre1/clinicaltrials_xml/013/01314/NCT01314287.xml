	<brief_summary>General anaesthesia cause small area lung collapse ( referred atelectasis ) many strategy use prevent reverse , strategy temporarily improve lung function persist post anaesthesia care unit ( PACU ) atelectasis may still present . One possible explanation cough occur end anaesthesic may cause atelectasis occur . Over 70 % patient cough breathe tube remove emerge anaesthetic , hypothesis presence breathe tube prevents normal cough occur may worsen atelectasis . This study use alveolar-arterial oxygen difference ( AaDO2 ) measure well lungs oxygenate blood . This measure 30 minute end anaesthetic control measure patient 's lung function , 60 minute patient woken , change compare amount cough observed patient emerge anaesthetic .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Coughing Oxygenation Post Anaesthetic Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study hop answer question whether amount cough occurs patient emerges anaesthesia negative impact ability lung transfer oxygen blood post anaesthetic care unit ( PACU ) . The patient ' involvement start 45 minute anticipated end surgery standard lung recruitment manoevre perform . Fifteen minute later 2ml blood sample take arterial catheter place begin surgery . From , together routinely monitored clinical data , alveolar/arterial oxygen difference ( AaDO2 ) calculate . The AaDO2 use measure degree impairment lung 's ability fully oxygenate blood . Next , patient wake anaesthesia , observer ( involved clinical care patient ) record amount cough occurs . Assessment cough involve recording : - time spent cough - number cough remove breathe tube Postoperative care routine oxygen give require . 1 hour removal tracheal tube second arterial blood sample take arterial catheter whilst patient breathe 40 % oxygen AaDO2 calculate . Following second blood sample subject 's involvement study end . During operation stipulation make regard anaesthetic technique use , leave entirely discretion anaesthetist clinical responsibility patient . In last 30 minute operation , patient 's artificial ventilation oxygen concentration 40 % set 'positive end expiratory pressure ' ( PEEP ) . Other , anaesthetist free wake patient preferred method . Also , time responsible anaesthetist feel adjustment ventilation require order act patient 's best interest , patient remove trial . Data record include sex , age , ASA grade ( measurement patient ' fitness anaesthetic ) , height weight , whether patient smoker whether patient lung disease . At end surgery , operation perform duration record . These data require characterise population patient study allow comparison research . No medication perioperative treatment need withhold modified consequence patient enrol study . There requirement start addition medication consequence study . Patients may withdraw time withdrawal consent , case subject data destroy fact consent withdrawn document . The anaesthetist clinical responsibility patient may withdraw patient study time , case reason withdrawal document data collection form data collect kept study completion .</detailed_description>
