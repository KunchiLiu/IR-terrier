	<detailed_description>Dependence tobacco derive nicotine major public health problem . Data suggest tobacco smoker impulsive self-report behavioral measure non-smokers . Behavioral measure impulsivity predict outcome smoking cessation . Successful quitter well impulse control compare current smoker . Impulsivity define behaviorally predisposition toward rapid , unplanned reaction internal external stimulus without regard negative consequence . Impulsivity often measure behaviorally two major domain , delay discounting , i.e. , choice small immediate reward large , delayed reward , response inhibition , inability stop response initiate . A drug-free method decrease smoker ' impulsivity enhance inhibitory control could improve sustain efficacy smoke cessation treatment . Treatments integrate mindfulness associate decrease impulsiveness substance use people addiction . A preliminary study report 100 % mindfulness-trained smoker meditate least 45 minute daily still abstinent 6 week post-quit . Preliminary data suggest mindfulness train benefit people substance use disorder multiple cognitive mechanism , include decrease self-report motor impulsiveness . Yet , widely accept behavioral measure impulsivity inhibitory control use measure effect mindfulness practice smoker . This project aim evaluate relationship mindfulness behavioral measure impulsivity inhibitory control smoke cessation early abstinence . Data mindfulness-oriented treatment study suggest at-home formal meditation practice important variable attain positive clinical outcome . This conclusion support prevail theory high dos repetitive meditation practice elicit cortical remodeling . Since addiction conceptualize disease stag neuroplasticity , intensive behavioral program induce accelerate therapeutic neuroplasticity particularly compelling . Current method self-reporting dose formal mindfulness practice may vulnerable response bias poor reporting response rate . We plan use actigraphic monitoring formal mindfulness practice use Actiwatch Score behaviorally validate meditation time rigorously test meditation dose effect theory hypothesize formal meditation practice time predict improvement inhibitory control , delay discounting , smoke outcome .</detailed_description>
