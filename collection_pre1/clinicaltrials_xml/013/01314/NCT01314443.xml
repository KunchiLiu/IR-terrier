	<brief_summary>Cigarette smoking significant risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause premature mortality US . The detrimental effect smoke vascular dysfunction attribute effect smoke inflammatory response induces . Smoking cessation restores vascular function alleviate stress response . However , smoke cessation nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) , prevail approach mitigate tobacco dependence , fail allow full restoration vascular function . Thus , critical public health problem exist understand NRT prevents restoration vascular function NRT-mediated impairment overcome use gamma-tocopherol ( g-T ) innovative co-therapy . The objective study conduct clinical intervention trial aim reduce CVD risk define smoke cessation g-T restore vascular function . The hypothesis smoking cessation dietary g-T supplementation synergistically restore smoking-induced impairment vascular function ameliorate oxidative/nitrosative stress response , g-T facilitate full restoration vascular function otherwise precluded NRT . A placebo-controlled , g-T intervention study conduct cigarette smoker undergo nicotine-free NRT smoking cessation . Prior 24 h 7 day placebo g-T administration , vascular function evaluate use non-invasive ultrasound technique array antioxidants biomarkers vascular inflammation oxidative/nitrosative stress response assess . Collectively , study help identify vascular function regulate individual undergo smoking cessation , whether g-T use strategy well improve vascular function smoke cessation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While well know smoke cessation reduces risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , rate CVD risk normalize relatively slow . This suggest need good define co-therapies target oxidative stress inflammatory response otherwise impair vascular function . In randomized placebo-controlled clinical study , smoker undergo smoke cessation without nicotine replacement therapy receive dietary supplementation gamma-tocopherol ( 500 mg/day ) placebo 7 day . Their vascular function biomarkers CVD risk ( inflammatory protein , antioxidant , oxidized lipid ) assess prior , 1 day 7 day smoke cessation without gamma-tocopherol supplementation define potential mechanism gamma-tocopherol may accelerate restoration vascular function assist reduce CVD risk .</detailed_description>
