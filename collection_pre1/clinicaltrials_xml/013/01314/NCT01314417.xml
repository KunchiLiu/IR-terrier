	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Uveitis comprises group diseases associate inflammation eye lead vision loss . Some people uveitis also macular edema ( swell retina back eye ) . Uveitis macular edema treat medication sometimes surgery , treatment always prevent vision loss . Previous research show injection methotrexate eye people eye disease uveitis help relieve inflammation , swell , cause macular edema slow visual loss . However , yet approve treatment macular edema associate uveitis . OBJECTIVES : To evaluate safety effectiveness methotrexate injection treatment macular edema associate uveitis . ELIGIBILITY : Individuals least 18 year age diagnose uveitis macular edema least one eye . DESIGN : - This study require least nine visit National Eye Institute study clinic period 6 month ( 24 week ) . - Participants screen physical ophthalmic examination , medical history , blood urine test , additional eye test need . - Participants receive methotrexate injection select treatment eye . After injection , participant receive antibiotic eye drop place eye three time day 3 day follow injection , leucovorin ( folic acid ) drop place eye four time day 1 week follow injection , dose folic acid take mouth day injection . - Participants tolerate initial injection may continue receive injection study eye every month 6 month . After 6 month , participant show improvement injection may evaluate receive additional injection every 4 8 week researcher end study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Non-infectious Intermediate Posterior Uveitis Associated Macular Edema With Intravitreal Methotrexate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The study objective investigate safety , tolerability potential efficacy intravitreal injection methotrexate possible treatment chronic macular edema secondary panuveitis , posterior intermediate uveitis . STUDY POPULATION : Five participant chronic macular edema associate panuveitis , posterior intermediate uveitis initially enrol . However , additional two participant may enrol account participant withdraw study prior reach Week 12 . Eligibility criterion include macular edema study eye , responsive conventional immunosuppressive therapy past three month , participant experience recurrence macular edema conventional immunosuppressive therapy . STUDY DESIGN : In single-center , prospective , uncontrolled , unmasked , Phase I/II clinical trial , intravitreal injection methotrexate dose 400 μg per 100 μL administer . There induction phase pro nata ( PRN ) phase . During induction phase , participant receive injection baseline Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 20 study eye unless contraindicate . Additional safety visit occur Weeks 1 2 . Beginning Week 24 , participant agree remain study undergo evaluation injection study eye PRN every 4-8 week . These participant follow 4-8 week last enrolled participant complete his/her Week 24 visit . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome number participant meet definition treatment success within 12 week baseline . Treatment success define achieve least 1-step decrease LogScore scale central macular thickness . Secondary outcome include change Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , change excess retinal thickening , change macular thickness , change intraocular inflammation clinical exam , change leakage see fluorescein angiography ( FA ) , change autofluorescence pattern see fundus autofluorescence ( FAF ) image observation dose reduction systemic immunosuppression steroid . Safety outcomes include number severity adverse event , systemic ocular toxicity , electrophysiologic change assess full-field electroretinography ( ERG ) number withdrawal .</detailed_description>
