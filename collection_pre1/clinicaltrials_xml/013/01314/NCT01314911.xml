	<brief_summary>People infect influenza virus may develop respiratory illness , pneumonia , life-threatening complication . Currently , four antiviral medication use treat influenza . This study examine one medication , oseltamivir , examine affect shed influenza virus infected people .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Use Oseltamivir Treatment Influenza Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Seasonal influenza responsible excess hospitalization , despite effective antiviral , cause significant morbidity mortality ( 24,000 death year United States alone ) . The influenza virus emerge 2009 ( A/California/07/2009 H1N1 ) cause few death ( 12,000 flu-related death U.S. ) contrast seasonal flu , nearly 90 % deaths 2009 H1N1 occur among people young 65 year age . Although four currently license anti-influenza medication ( amantadine rimantadine , oseltamivir , zanamivir ) , previous study demonstrate conclusively extent medication affect influenza viral shed . This study evaluate whether oseltamivir modifies viral shed treatment uncomplicated influenza adult population also assess method detect viral replication upper respiratory tract . Subjects present influenza-like illness without risk factor severe disease screen study . Those confirmatory test influenza ( rapid antigen polymerase chain reaction [ PCR ] ) randomize 1:1 manner receive blind study treatment consist either oseltamivir placebo 5 day . Clinical , virologic , laboratory assessment Days 1 , 3 , 7 , 28 use safety efficacy analysis .</detailed_description>
