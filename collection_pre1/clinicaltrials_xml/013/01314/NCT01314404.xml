Working experienced collaborator , propose carry HPV prevalence study ( among woman diagnose cervical cancer Hôpital Touré ) , couple study Knowledge , Attitudes Practices ( KAP ) Willingness To Participate ( WTP ) HPV vaccine study among individual live Sikoro-Mekin .

	<brief_title>KAP/WTP HPV Prevalence Studies Developing World Setting ( Bamako , Mali )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccination Gardasil vaccine potential eradicate cervical cancer worldwide . However , impact quadrivalent Gardasil vaccination develop world setting , HPV subtype prevalence may differ , unknown . Prior conduct Phase IV trial , HPV subtyping study . Furthermore , data available vaccine acceptability , health system preparedness vaccine cost-effectiveness long-term impact region world . We propose : ( ) Evaluate , sample 160 woman diagnose cervical cancer recruit hospital Hôpital Touré , prevalence HPV subtypes associate cervical cancer . Hôpital Touré referral center cervical cancer patient entire city Bamako ( &gt; 1.8M inhabitant ) . ( ii ) Train local clinical staff implement good clinical protocol good clinical laboratory practice cervical cancer screening , establish HPV sub-typing methodology affiliate laboratory site [ Sikoro , Bamako , Mali National Institute Research Public Health ( INRSP ) , Bamako ] . ( iii ) Perform survey evaluate Knowledge Attitude Practice ( KAP ) Willingness To Participate ( WTP ) regard HPV HPV vaccine propose trial site ( 300 individual ask complete survey train surveyor ; minimum 100 adolescent 200 parent ) . Use focus group house-by-house interview mean collect data . Obtain information prefer consenting , screen notification practice . Methodology : ( ) We plan identify recruit sample 160 woman diagnose cervical cancer within department gynecology Hospital Gabriel Touré Bamako , Mali . These patient previously identify diagnosed clinical exam obstetrician-gynecologist Gabriel Touré , identify surgical candidate doctor . Recruitment do appointment either curative biopsy extensive surgical procedure . No biopsy do sake study . During study , participant sign consent form undergo interview nurse . The nurse charge briefly present propose study protocol ensure patient ( ) positively diagnosed cervical cancer ( diagnosis establish clinical case and/or base patient 's history ) , ( b ) voluntarily express willingness biopsy gynecological operation doctor collect tissue sample `` standard '' medical appointment ( i.e . link study ) , ( c ) agree blood drawn , ( ) old 18 , ( e ) capacity give inform consent . In order collect necessary data study , follow procedure use : - Blood draw : Blood sample collect order measure antibodies panel HPV type , include HPV 16 18 . Blood sample send laboratory Applied Molecular Biology ( LAMB/LBMA ) locate Bamako , centrifugation serum aliquoting . The serum sample store -20°C sent United States every four month serological test Merck laboratory . - Serology : The serum sample send Merck research laboratory United States ( Wayne Laboratories ) test use Luminex immunological assay . This assay allow detection HPV type 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 . - Rapid test : A rapid test conduct cell tissue sample . This test allow detection 14 type HPV ( 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 66 , 68 ) two half hour . - Tissue collection : Two cervical scrape collect patient . One sample take cell outer open cervix sample take cell inside cervical canal . Cervical scrape store liquid nitrogen maximum preservation send Merck laboratory analyze laboratory technician . - HPV Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) : PCR assay conduct Laboratory Applied Molecular Biology ( LBMA ) adherence strict standard good laboratory practice . HPV sub-typing conduct cell cervical scrape . In order protect identity confidentiality patient , unique identification number use . Only study personnel - patient , request - access study result . ( ii ) We identify train expert necessary study . We plan recruit train local medical personnel clinical laboratory practice . We want develop necessary protocol study , put infrastructure place , train medical personnel . This step necessary study , also prepare vaccine trial ( possible ) . The goal lay groundwork clinical study come , improve condition vaccine research Mali . ( iii ) In order ass KAP WTP regard HPV HPV vaccine , plan contact inhabitants Sikoro-Mekin help community leader peer educator . Sikoro peri-urban neighborhood Bamako population around 40,000 . The study comprise six sector neighborhood . We want interview around 300 people total . Two questionnaire give . The participant give first questionnaire , follow information education session . This follow second , identical questionnaire permit u measure information retention comprehension information session . The information session conduct either small group individually order improve quality information provide , well contact communication person survey . Data collection analysis : Data collect analyzed accord ( ) Interview questionnaire response ( ii ) HPV subtypes ( iii ) serology , Polymerase Chain Reaction ( PCR ) , rapid test result . Conclusion : Conducting study allow u collect information could help bolster fight spread HPV cervical cancer Mali . With development protocol train medical personnel , strive reinforce human capacity , improve research condition , lay groundwork clinical study come Mali . We hope collection analysis KAP/WTP data use goal promote introduction Gardasil vaccine Mali . Finally come year hope obtain approval use Gardasil plan HPV vaccine trial Mali .</detailed_description>
