	<brief_summary>Results observational study suggest small beneficial association protein blood pressure may mainly attributable intake protein plant source . In epidemiological study biomarkers dietary intake useful estimate intake reliably . Dietary study use biomarkers protein intake generally show strong association health outcome . However , data biomarkers specific type protein ( e.g . dairy , meat , grain legume ) scarce . Therefore purpose study identify new biomarkers intake protein meat , dairy grain . In addition secondary purpose investigate whether intake protein source influence kidney filtration rate urinary acid excretion differentially .</brief_summary>
