	<brief_summary>Fertilization embryo development vivo occur appropriate condition mammalian reproductive tract . However assisted reproductive technology ( ART ) embryo oocyte expose certain factor temperature , O2 pressure pH fluctuation may affect embryo development viability vitro . In Preimplantation Genetic Screening program ( PGS ) investigator need culture embryos day 5 requirement culture technique must optimal produce acceptable blastocyst rate . As show , embryo culture condition potential impact biopsied embryos hence PGS success rate . Nowadays coculture system endometrial cell could alternative option improve blastocyst rate since publication indicate endometrial cell may provide trace element growth factor present defined culture medium reproduce physiologic condition . Although role coculture vitro fertilization ( IVF ) controversial , recent meta-analysis establish potential benefit coculture system . The aim study compare embryologic clinical outcome term blastocyst , implantation pregnancy rate evaluate endometrial epithelial cell ( EEC ) coculture versus sequential culture system advance maternal age ( â‰¥39 year ) PGS program .</brief_summary>
