	<brief_summary>A major consequence chronic liver disease childhood growth failure . This chemical essential growth call growth factor create liver . Lack response growth hormone people chronic liver disease characterize high level growth hormone low level growth factor . This growth hormone resistance reflect variety factor include insulin resistance low nutritional intake . Unfortunately , growth hormone therapy effect child liver disease . In addition , failure normal growth malnutrition make liver disease even bad child , growth hormone therapy likely reverse . A lack proper nutrition associate hospitalization frequent complication . Poor growth predictor poor outcome liver transplantation . Thus management child liver disease remain challenge . Children successful orthotopic liver transplant ( OLT ) show much improvement aspect growth , include skin fold thickness , mid-arm circumference , normalization growth factor level . However , study recently report growth 15-20 % child remain poor even liver transplant . This explain persistent abnormality growth factor transplant . Growth factor find good tool prognosis patient chronic liver disease . Studies show patient liver cirrhosis growth factor level normal value show low long-term survival rate compare patient normal value . This suggest growth factor good predictor survival early marker poor liver function . In case , aggressive feeding may modestly improve growth factor level lead improved growth unlikely effect optimal . The investigator propose growth factor administration may positive effect lead well growth major predictor good outcome . To date , report study use growth factor child chronic liver disease . This study propose examine effect growth factor therapy childhood chronic liver disease .</brief_summary>
