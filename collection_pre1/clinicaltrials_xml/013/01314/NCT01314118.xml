	<brief_title>IMAAGEN : Impact Abiraterone Acetate Prostate-Specific Antigen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , prospective , multicenter , open-label , single-arm study abiraterone acetate plus prednisone men non-metastatic , castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) rise PSA despite castrate level testosterone . The study consist Screening Phase ( 4 week ) , Core Study Treatment Phase ( comprise six 28-day cycle ) , Pre-metastatic Disease Follow-up Phase ; 30-day Safety Follow-up Visit . Each treatment cycle last 28 day . Participating subject receive study agent ( Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg/day plus prednisone 5 mg/day , orally ) continually study . Subjects radiographic confirm disease progression Core Study Treatment Phase continue study treatment Pre-metastatic Disease Follow-up Phase . The study end participate subject disease progression . Subjects require return study site 30 day receive last dose abiraterone acetate safety follow-up .</detailed_description>
