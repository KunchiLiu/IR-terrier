	<brief_summary>Ionizing radiation number harmful effect human . The important among induction cancer . It assume damage DNA nucleus single cell induce cancer . Among different type lesion induct , DNA double-strand break ( DSBs ) consider relevant effect initiate carcinogenesis . The investigator already conduct several study prospectively compare inducted DSBs coronary CT-angiography conventional coronary angiography . Extending examination investigate induce DSBs myocardial scintigraphy allow comparison three relevant image method heart incorporate ionize radiation . To evaluate , investigator plan examine patient schedule clinically indicate myocardial scintigraphy . These examination routinely do Department Nuclear Medicine either 1-day 2-day protocol accord diagnostic reference value Federal Department Radiological Protection . Blood sample take patient predefined time step examination DNA double-strand break determine blood sample specifically consider apply activity tracer exposition kinetics .</brief_summary>
