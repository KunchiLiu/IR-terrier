	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate two different Lenalidomide dos ( 15 mg vs. 25 mg ) combination low dose dexamethasone patient relapse multiple myeloma . The investigator propose use need dose reduction criterion judge tolerability various cause . In veteran population predominantly old age category number co-morbidities , low dose regimen may safer advantageous . This study expect enroll approximately 80 subject participate VA site across nation . The investigator evaluate safety two dose regimen compare frequency dose reduction . The investigator also measure long response last dose . Lenalidomide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) receive least 1 prior therapy . MDS MM cancer blood . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider experimental . At time enrollment , one-half subject choose random receive 15 mg Lenalidomide dose half take 25 mg dose regimen Lenalidomide . Depending lenalidomide treatment assignment , subject receive either 15 mg p.o . q.d . 25 mg p.o . q.d . day 1-21 28 day cycle . In addition , dexamethasone ( 40 mg ) add week ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 22 ) Lenalidomide regimen , dose reduction schedule patient tolerate high dose dexamethasone . ASA ( 81 325mg ) give daily anticoagulation prophylaxis . Patients intolerant ASA may use low molecular weight heparin . Lovenox recommend . Coumadin allow provide patient fully anticoagulate INR 2.0 2.5 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : • Evaluate frequency dose reduction two different lenalidomide dose regimen . Secondary Objectives : - Evaluate efficacy two different lenalidomide dose regimen patient multiple myeloma use EBMT IMWG criterion . - Evaluate duration response 15 mg Lenalidomide 25 mg Lenalidomide use combination Low Dose Dexamethasone . - Evaluate safety 15 mg 25 mg Lenalidomide regiment combination dexamethasone . - Explore blood cellular level angiogenic factor , cytokine , adhesion molecule .</detailed_description>
