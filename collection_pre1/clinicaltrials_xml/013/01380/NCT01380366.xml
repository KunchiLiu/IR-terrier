	<brief_summary>Patients ask participate study short small bowel prescribed take medication : Zorbtive® ( `` Zorbtive/Somatropin/ ( rHGH ) '' ) . Zorbtive® FDA approve recombinant human growth hormone ( rHGH ) . The investigator want see take medication improve small bowel function help take food , nutrient , vitamin mineral . The investigator also believe small bowel absorb food nutrient well , liver function improve well . Therefore , liver function also monitor course study perform blood test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>rHGH Intestinal Permeability Intestinal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label pilot study convenience sample 20 subject participate 26 month . At baseline visit , subject sign consent form question answer . An inpatient appointment make General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . Subjects give instruction fill 7-day food diary week prior inpatient appointment . In diary , subject ask record type amount food ingest 7-day period . This allow researcher review subject ' food intake prior sugar permeability test . Although subject serve his/her control , information may useful upon review variation permeability subject . To evaluate potential hepato-protective effect improve intestinal barrier function , blood test evaluate liver injury function ( i.e . ALT , AST , total bilirubin , ALP , GGT ) obtain . These labs part subject 's standard care follow-up , therefore study staff abstract data subject 's medical record . The sugar permeability test require 8-hour overnight fast , follow ingestion 4 capsule sucralose ( 250mg per capsule ) , 2.0 gram mannitol , 7.5 gram lactulose , 40 gram sucrose 150 mL water . Over next 5 hour , urine collect . Intestinal permeability quantify urine ratio lactulose , mannitol sucralose . After urine collection complete , subject begin 28 day Zorbtive® administration . All evaluation ( subject food diary , bloodwork , sugar permeability test ) repeat 28 day later , within 72 hour receive final dose Zorbtive® . The bloodwork drawn part subject 's standard care follow-up , therefore study staff abstract data subject 's medical record . Following completion study visit GCRC , study staff obtain result liver injury/ function test [ ( ALT ) , ( AST ) , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase ( ALK ALP ) , ( GGT ) ] medical record routine clinical exam Month 3 Month 24 , follow 28-day treatment Zorbtive® therapy . These labs part subject 's standard care follow-up , therefore study staff abstract data subject 's medical record . Subjects ask return separate study visit . Since intestinal epithelium completely reconstitute approximately every 7 day , anticipated potential influence rHGH barrier function relate liver injury realize end 28 day study period . The long term durability change observe 28 day observe , likely require study .</detailed_description>
