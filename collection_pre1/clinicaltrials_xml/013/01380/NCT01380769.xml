	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study CRLX101 Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer remain leading cause cancer-related mortality men woman worldwide . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account approximately 80 % lung cancer . The development target therapy change approach treat NSCLC significantly past decade target therapy generally possess safety advantage traditional cytotoxic regimen . However , combination paradigm resistance pattern complicate use agent . CRLX101 nanoparticle comprise camptothecin ( CPT ) conjugate cyclodextrin-based polymer . CRLX101 design increase exposure tumor cell CPT minimize side effect .</detailed_description>
