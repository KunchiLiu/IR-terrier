	<brief_summary>People HIV high chance become infected TB , especially live area TB infection common . It difficult diagnose TB people need start HIV treatment right away . Within 6 month start HIV treatment , people become sick TB even die . This study do people start HIV treatment live area TB infection rate high . The purpose study test experimental approach TB treatment see well usual approach . The experimental approach start TB treatment time HIV treatment , even TB infection find . The usual approach start TB treatment TB infection find . In study , half people start TB treatment time start HIV treatment . The half start TB treatment TB infection find . The study also test safe effective start TB treatment time HIV treatment even TB infection find . The study collect information diet , whether ( ) people study become sicker die , well HIV control , feeling , take medication , whether matter live kind HIV TB care standard , many people diagnose TB study , cost two treatment option national level could compare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , phase IV strategy trial participant resource-limited setting ( RLS ) present advance HIV disease probable confirm tuberculosis ( TB ) , define current ACTG diagnosis appendix , initiate antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) randomize one two strategy arm : immediate , empiric TB treatment ( Empiric arm ) local standard care TB treatment ( IPT arm ) . Randomization balance clinical trial unit stratify accord CD4+ T cell count ( &lt; 25 vs. ≥25 cells/mm^3 ) presence follow prognostic factor : reportable hospitalization within past 30 day , BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m^2 , anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl ) . Participants follow 96 week . Participants attend study visit screen , enrollment , week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 , 24 . Signs symptom , ART modification , concomitant medication , clinical event define AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( ACTG ) Appendix 60 collected visit . Blood collect CD4 HIV-1 RNA study entry , week 4 24 blood safety laboratory ( liver function , hematology , renal function ) collect visit except week 1 . A sputum sample collect stored study entry . The current result submission include data primary outcome time point ( week 24 ) , study completion , second result submission include data later visit week 96 .</detailed_description>
