	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess impact Gamma3 intramedullary nail versus slide hip screw health-related quality life measure EuroQuol-5D 52 week individual trochanteric fracture . Secondary outcome include revision surgery rate , fracture heal rate , fracture related adverse event , health-related quality life , include Parker mobility score Harris Hip Score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intramedullary Nail Versus Sliding Hip Screw Inter-Trochanteric Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture become prevalent issue worldwide , lead profound morbidity , case , mortality . Currently common method surgical treatment include use slide hip screw Gamma intramedullary nail , conflict evidence regard device low revision surgery rate complication rate . Recent improvement implant design Gamma3 nail , demonstrate decrease rate femoral shaft fracture improve function , provide compel rationale conduct large , definitive trial . This trial definitive , multi-center , conceal randomize control trial . Surgeons use one two surgical strategy patient sustain trochanteric fracture ; Gamma3 intramedullary nail slide hip screw . Clinical assessment occur time hospital admission , post-surgery , 13 week , 26 week , 52 week , 104 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adult men woman age 18 year old ( upper age limit ) . 2 . An intertrochanteric fracture ( stable unstable ) , AO Type 31A1 31A2 , confirm anteroposterior lateral hip radiograph , compute tomography , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . 3 . Low energy fracture ( defined fall stand height ) . 4 . No major trauma . 5 . Patient ambulatory prior fracture , though may use aid cane walker . 6 . Anticipated medical optimization patient operative fixation proximal femur . 7 . Operative treatment within 7 day trauma . ( Operative treatment take place soon possible permitted institution 's standard care . ) 8 . Provision informed consent patient proxy . 1 . Associated major injury low extremity ( i.e. , ipsilateral and/or contralateral fracture foot , ankle , tibia , fibula , knee ; dislocation ankle , knee , hip ) . 2 . Retained hardware around affect proximal femur . 3 . Infection around proximal femur ( i.e. , soft tissue bone ) . 4 . Patients disorder bone metabolism osteoporosis ( i.e. , Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy , osteomalacia ) . 5 . Patients Parkinson 's disease severe enough increase likelihood fall severe enough compromise rehabilitation . 6 . Patients subtrochanteric fracture . 7 . Patients pathologic fracture . 8 . Patients reverse oblique fracture pattern , fracture AO Type 31A3 . 9 . Obesity judgment attend surgeon . 10 . Offlabel use implant . 11 . Patients previous history frank dementia would interfere assessment primary outcome ( i.e. , EQ5D 1 year ) . 12 . Likely problem , judgment Site Investigators , maintain followup . We , example , exclude patient fixed address , report plan move town next year , intellectually challenge patient without adequate family support . 13 . Patient enrol another ongoing drug surgical intervention trial . 14 . If attend surgeon believe another reason exclude patient INSITE . This reason document case report form ( CRFs ) .</criteria>
