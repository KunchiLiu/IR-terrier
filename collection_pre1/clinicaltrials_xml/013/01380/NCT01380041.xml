	<brief_summary>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) inflammatory disease brain leading disability . Brain MRI useful MS diagnosis prognostic biomarkers still need . New therapy also expect improve MS care . Cytokine array provide measure many different inflammation-related molecule could help understanding disease . Moreover , individual prognosis could link level molecule CSF MS patient . The investigator analyze cytokine profile MS control patient CSF determine specific profile MS look prognosis implication cohort patient clinically isolate syndrome ( first manifesatation MS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) inflammatory disease brain leading disability . Early treatment could allow good prognosis patient long term reduce relapse rate neurological palsy . However , individual prognostic biomarkers still need adapt treatment give patient . CSF strategic body fluid explore neurological disease . In MS , contain elevate IgG index and/or oligoclonal band reflect intrathecal synthesis Igs around brain . The level inflammatory molecule cytokine metalloproteases also know elevate MS ( GM-CSF , IL-6 , IL-10 , MMP-2 , MMP9 , TIMP-1 , TNF-α , RANTES , MCP-1 MIP-1 ) . These molecule easily measure protein arrays.The aim study measure level 40 cytokine 10 MMPs mean protein array CSF clinically definite MS ( CDMS ) patient , control patient patient clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) . The best MS marker determine use multiple ROC curve . Markers rapid conversion CDMS CIS also look for.The best MS candidate biomarkers analyze ELISA new cohort patient recruit .</detailed_description>
