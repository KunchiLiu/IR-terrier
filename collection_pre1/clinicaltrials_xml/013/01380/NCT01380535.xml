	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Uvadex Extracorporeal Photopheresis ( ECP ) Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label study ( patient study staff know identity treatment assign study ) patient chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGvHD ) . Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( donator-versus-recipient-disease ) complication occur blood stem cell bone marrow transplant cell relate unrelated donator . During cGvHD , transplant cell attack recipient 's body . Patients cGVHD meet entry criterion study randomly assign receive standard care treatment 26 week standard care treatment extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) 26 week . Standard care treatment consist orally ( take mouth ) administer corticosteroid ( drug reduce inflammation ) cyclosporine ( CsA ) Tacrolimus ( drug suppress patient 's immune response ) . ECP therapy process take place device investigational drug UVADEX ( methoxsalen ) inject germ-free bag mixed patient 's white blood cell . After blood cell absorb drug expose ultraviolet A ( UVA ) radiation , blood cell inject back patient 's body . During study , third party assessor study center blind ( know ) treatment assess condition patient 's skin oral mucosa protocol-specified visit complete total skin score patient . The study consist 3 phase : screening phase , open label treatment phase end-of-study ( early withdrawal ) phase . The duration patient participation 28 week patient safety monitor throughout study . An additional non-interventional 2 year follow-up begin 28 week/withdrawal end-of-study phase .</detailed_description>
