	<brief_summary>The knowledge concern biology human tumor stop widening , particular concern molecular mechanism origin process carcinogenesis ability become perpetual . The identification increase knowledge abnormality allow last year development therapeutic strategy target specifically molecular pathway involve carcinogenesis . It quickly lead numerous therapeutic success association conventional chemotherapy , allow good individualization treatment accord biological characteristic tumor patient . However therapeutic effective patient carry specific genomic mutation make necessary systematic research one kind mutation . The problem currently mutational status frequently make tissue result initial tumor biopsy , exclude evolution biology metastasis report different genomic status , theoretical solution make biopsy systematically metastasis , always technically possible . The problem still complicate investigator know biology tumor may evolve time , particularly treatment , appearance chemotherapy resistant clone . The monitoring genomic status tumor thus appear crucial stake next year cancer research far efficiency numerous therapeutic target put disposal clinician , depend largely . The repeated access tumor tissue , follow-up patient treatment , seem indispensable guide prematurely therapeutic , particular stopping target therapeutic investigator know go effective , avoid expose patient useless toxicity treatment often extremely expensive , usage reserve patient could respond . The access circulate tumor cell blood patient repeatable , invasive technique ( blood test ) henceforth accessible thanks technique use magnetic sort tumor cell select antibody direct tumor antigen EpCAM . This new technology ( CellSearch , Veridex system ) totally standardized automate , allow total sample blood patient , determine quantity circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) .The number CTC seem constitute recent study , powerful prognosis tool moment diagnosis , also treatment , accord decrease chemotherapy . In United States , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) recently approve use system quantification CTCs care patient affect breast , colon , prostate cancer . The CellSearch system probably become future year indispensable tool help clinician encircle good prognosis patient . This technology already allow realize besides quantification , isolation viable CTCs , genetic material extract , amplify thus potentially analyze . The investigator thus see interest device represent non invasive monitoring patient treatment target molecular abnormality susceptible evolve time . The investigator thus propose study thanks system CellSearch feasibility research mutation K-Ras EGFR CTC patient carrier metastatic non small cell bronchial carcinoma . Secondly , investigator research interested possible conflict exist primitive tumor CTCs various popular mutation . In case feasibility method , good initial concordance genomic status CTCs tumor , investigator shall describe genomic evolution treatment monitor CTCs patient target therapeutic . The investigator shall describe premature observation modification precedes appearance effective resistance treatment .</brief_summary>
