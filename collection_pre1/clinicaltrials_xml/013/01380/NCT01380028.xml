	<brief_summary>The chronic subdural hematoma common disease population 60 year . For example , patient 70 year , occurs every year 7 new case per 100,000 people . A chronic subdural hematoma accumulation blood intracranial space brain membrane ( dura mater ) brain . The origin blood area follow minor brain injury , cause rupture small vessel area . During evolution , volume hematoma increase . After week , amount fluid build-up compress brain . That 's clinical symptom occur : persistent headache , neurological deficit , seizure , impaired consciousness , cognitive function ( memory loss , impaired intellectual function , hallucination , etc. ) . The compression brain may cause impairment consciousness result severe case coma death . At stage , neurosurgical intervention necessary . Recurrences numerous ( 15 25 % recurrence six month neurosurgery ) . That France , 20 % medical team administer postoperative treatment corticosteroid reduce risk recurrence . Until , potential benefit treatment yet confirm clinical study . So purpose research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The chronic subdural hematoma ( HSDC ) common disease population 60 year . The incidence 7 / 100000 patient 70 year . This condition occur readily minor head injury . Bleeding secondary cerebral concussion vascular fragility cortico-dural vein . It favor case take anti-platelet blood thinner . The hematoma form cause local inflammatory reaction . This reaction tend partition collection formation membrane whose pathological vessel weaken inflammation , cause bleed iterative low abundance . A vicious circle establish combination phenomenon cause progressive worsen clinical radiological.Because importance recurrence ( 15 25 % 6 month ) high rate mortality one year ( 10 15 % ) , also suppose pathophysiological mechanism ( inflammation , formation membrane self-sustaining blood collection ) , postoperative treatment corticosteroid introduce secondary prevention team ( 20 % France ) . However , practice never prospective study clinical radiological interest.The aim prospective multicenter randomize , double blind , evaluate patient chronic subdural hematoma , compare placebo , efficacy postoperative corticosteroid treatment orally approximately 2 month rate clinical recurrence / radiological subdural hematoma 6 month surgery ( primary endpoint ) .The secondary endpoint rate mortality one year , 6 month follow-up clinical radiological evolution , neurological status ( Markwalder scale ) , quality life ( health scale perceptual Nottingham ) , autonomy ( Karnofsky scale ) , state consciousness ( Glasgow scale ) , size hematoma CT scan without injection.340 adult patient 2 sex receive surgical treatment chronic subdural hematoma unilateral bilateral primary diagnosis ( hematoma hypodense isodense blade least 3 mm thick axial CT scan brain ) include study 5 center ( service Neurosurgery Hospital Montpellier , Marseille , Nice , Perpignan Lyon ) .Patients enrol assigned one two treatment group ( active treatment placebo ) lot . Active treatment prednisone establishment within 72 hour end surgery dose 1 mg / kg ( rounded nearest 10 mg ) daily orally one week . The daily dose decrease increment 10 mg weekly , second week . Once level 10 mg / day reach daily dose one level low 5 mg weekly . Treatment stop week 5 mg / day .. The placebo similar respect active treatment administer way active treatment . Additional treatment administer patient throughout duration experimental treatment . It vitamin calcium supplementation prevent risk osteoporosis.Medical monitoring patient period six month visit schedule various department Neurosurgery 1 month , 3 month 6 month surgery . Each visit consultation neurosurgical team physician include review clinical research recurrence subdural hematoma collection adverse event . This physician , independent investigative team , also collect score Markwalder , Nottingham , Karnofsky Glasgow . Analysis CT scan centralize . A blood sample perform visit 1 month , establish biological monitoring relation potential electrolyte disturbance relate steroids.The mortality survey take place 1 year surgery telephone interview investigator patient entourage.The overall duration study 6 year include 4 year clinical phase.Given extensive use corticosteroid treatment chronic subdural hematoma absence solid data subject , research clarify role corticosteroid secondary prevention improve overall management patient .</detailed_description>
