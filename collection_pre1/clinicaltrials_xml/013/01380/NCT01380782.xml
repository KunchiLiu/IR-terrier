	<brief_title>BIBF 1120 Recurrent High-Grade Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two arm , multicenter , open label phase II trial adult patient recurrent supratentorial high-grade glioma . One arm ( `` bevacizumab naïve '' arm ) enroll patient receive prior bevacizumab therapy , arm ( `` post-bevacizumab '' arm ) enroll patient experienced progression bevacizumab . All subject receive BIBF 1120 200mg orally , twice daily cycle 28 day . Subjects come clinic Day 1 cycle ( within 2 day prior ) blood urine test physical neurologic exam . Bloods also check within 2 day Day 15 Cycles 1 2 . An additional blood sample take Days 1 8 Cycle 1 , start every even-numbered cycle , end active study treatment . Subjects gadolinium-enhanced brain MRI scan perform tumor measurement screen , start even-numbered cycle , end active study treatment ( unless already obtain within 4 week complete study treatment ) . 40 study subject diffusion- perfusion-weighted MRI baseline , 1 week therapy ( ± 2 day ) , within 2 day prior start every even-numbered cycle , end treatment ( unless already obtain within 4 week complete study treatment ) .</detailed_description>
