	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) degenerative disease difficult diagnose . The clinicopathological study demonstrate 76 % accuracy clinical diagnosis PD . At begin PD difficult clinician distinguish Parkinsonism Plus Syndromes ( PPS ) due similarity symptom lack specific diagnostic test . Specific biomarkers help improve accuracy diagnosis separate two entity highly need The histological hallmark definite diagnosis PD presence fibrillar aggregate phosphorylated alpha-synuclein call Lewy body ( LBs ) Lewy neurites . Previous autopsy-based study reveal alpha-synuclein deposited peripheral autonomic nervous system include enteric nervous system alimentary tract , cardiac plexus , adrenal medulla skin . For reason , patient parkinsonism , alternative tool could demonstrate alpha-synuclein fibrillar aggregate skin , allow early appropriate diagnosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parkinsonism , syndrome , common movement disorder , Parkinson 's disease , common cause parkinsonism , second prevalent neurodegenerative disease Alzheimer 's disease . The clinical diagnosis PD base presence four common feature : tremor limb rest , resistance passive movement joint ( rigidity ) , slowness paucity movement ( bradykinesia akinesia ) postural abnormality . Approximately 25 percent patient receive initial clinical diagnosis PD find parkinsonism part another disorder , one so-called Parkinsonism-Plus Syndromes ( PPS ) The number complexity PPS seem increase . This , along lack diagnostic test , make difficult clinician distinguish disease type . Some characteristic clinical feature use differential diagnosis , manifestation include early severe postural instability , fall first year onset , abnormal eye movement , autonomic dysfunction , cerebellar sign upper motor neuron sign . The PPS respond poorly antiparkinsonian medication bad prognosis PD . In spite suggestive feature , PD patient progression , case impossible separate typical PD PPS , especially early stage . In context , biological marker must great usefulness differential diagnosis entity . Some report describe early feature PD ( SPECT ) image dopamine transporter demonstrate reduction dopamine transporter striatum body early stage PD degeneration cardiac sympathetic nerve begin disease process PD ; occur neuronal cell loss present dorsal vagal nucleus ; This fact account reduced cardiac uptake meta-iodobenzylguanidine ( MIBG ) , physiological analog norepinephrine . However , diagnostic method often perform . Therefore , sensitive method need help improve accuracy diagnosis PD .</detailed_description>
