	<brief_summary>Some overweight individual develop problem breathe gradually breathe less less . This lead lack oxygen buildup carbon dioxide blood , call ventilatory failure . As consequence , person develop chest infection , likely become seriously ill need intensive care . In addition much likely develop severe complication follow operation . This problem treat machine home use overnight help breathing . It interest ventilatory failure happen overweight individual , investigator understand factor make complication develop . There number theory : example distribution fat , additional lung disease ( asthma ) , addition obstructive sleep apnoea , condition period cessation breathe overnight ( common obese individual ) , weak muscle breathe ( perhaps due fatty infiltration muscle vitamin D deficiency ) , hormonal change . The investigator intend measure many potential factor range overweight individual , ventilatory failure , , try work important factor cause problem . If investigator identify factor , help predict advance risk chest infection operation ; thus allow early provision overnight breathe machine . This reduce complication potentially deaths individual .</brief_summary>
