	<brief_summary>The pathophysiology sickle cell disease ( SCD ) manifestation , complex interaction intracellular hemoglobin , membrane endothelial activation hallmark remain recurrent painful vaso-occlusive episode ( VOC ) . These painful episode think result ischemia cause small blood vessel occlude misshapen , inflexible erythrocyte . Painful episodes common cause hospitalization , morbidity , impairment SCD patient . There therapy completely prevent directly abort painful event patient . Consequently , treatment acute VOC primarily supportive use hydration medicinal pain control . Every pain medication potential relieve pain associate significant limitation side effect . The primary hypothesis test double blind , randomize control trial Nalbuphine equivalent morphine pain control patient suffer few episode acute chest syndrome . The investigator also expect subject report few side effect respiratory depression , abdominal distention reduce peristalsis , reduce histamine release cause pruritis still provide adequate pain control . Further hypothesis test ability recruit patient participant treat Emergency Department continuous infusion Nalbuphine accompany patient control analgesia ( PCA ) safe effective control pain , require less total opiate consumption , decrease length hospitalization .</brief_summary>
