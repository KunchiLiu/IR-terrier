	<brief_title>Primary Palatoplasty Pediatric Patients - A Retrospective Review Surgical Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Purpose : Children bear cleft palate require surgical correction order prevent nasal regurgitation food order create normal palate function speech . Uncorrected , speech hypernasal unintelligible . Normal speech sound normally nasal . In English , three , `` '' `` Mama '' , `` n '' `` '' , `` ng '' `` ring '' . The remain 43 sound English make soft palate ( velum ) closing nasopharynx , project speech orally . The goal surgical separation nose mouth hard palate ( palatoplasty ) create complete separation nose mouth hard palate function soft palate open close nasopharynx appropriately speech sound . Unfortunately , primary closure palate completely successful patient . In patient , open ( fistula ) remain ( anterior ) hard palate allow food speech leak nose . A second problem ( posterior ) soft palate may long enough move far enough close nasopharynx . This call velopharyngeal incompetence . These patient may also suffer nasal regurgitation hypernasal , unintelligible speech . Both palatal fistula velopharyngeal incompetence require secondary surgery . Any information gain review surgical outcome primary palatoplasty might improve surgical success reduce number secondary surgery require . This would reduce possible morbidity patient expense family . The purpose review evaluate outcome palatoplasty child follow Center Craniofacial Disorders Children 's Healthcare Atlanta Scottish Rite campus . The investigator evaluate occurence palatal fistula velopharyngeal incompetence . Summary Procedures : General Procedures : The clinical database Center Craniofacial Disorders evaluate Locations Involved : The Center Craniofacial Disorders Children 's Healthcare Atlanta Scottish Rite campus Number Subjects : 1295 patient treat since 1998 . Potential Risks : There physical , psychological , financial risk patient . Due nature record review study , information collect study contain Protected Health Information ( PHI ) subject . There potential risk unintentional disclosure information . However , certain step follow study minimalize PHI disclosure help protect subject ' privacy confidentiality . Patient confidentiality wil protect since database secure server within Children 's network . The database password-protected accessible clinician enter clinical note approve researcher . Other institution require law access research record , authorize research staff access research database associate study . Furthermore , data identifiable study subject , subject assign unique study number enter database . If publish present , identify feature provide . Potential Benefits : There might immediate benefit patient whose record evaluate . There potential benefit future patient see Center . Evaluation surgical outcome might identify potential hazard reduce effectiveness surgery . Efforts make avoid hazard future . The investigator might also find certain surgical technique age surgery lead good outcome . Surgical protocol could modify potential improvement surgical outcome future . Informed Consent Process : Due nature retrospective record review study , inform consent subject require Request Waiver Authorization submit . This research involve minimal risk subject , subject contact subject ' data utilized conduct research . There minimal risk breach confidentiality subject ' PHI disclose , however , procedure place protection collect PHI . The waiver inform consent adversely affect right welfare subject research change standard care confidentiality right respect . This research could practicably carry without waiver inform consent retrospective chart review study subject data need meet objective study consent practicably obtain patient . Whenever appropriate , subject provide additional pertinent information participation , however , case , subject ' standard care affect need contact subject . The Request Waiver Authorization outline type PHI collect , protection destruction plan PHI , assurances PHI re-disclosure , need collection PHI order conduct study .</detailed_description>
