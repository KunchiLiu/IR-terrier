	<brief_title>Entecavir/Pegylated Interferon Immune Tolerant Children With Chronic Hepatitis B Virus ( HBV ) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , control study conduct pediatric center within NIDDK-sponsored Hepatitis B Research Network ( HBRN ) . Children age 3- &lt; 18 year immunotolerant chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) infection fulfill entry criterion receive entecavir monotherapy 8 week combination therapy entecavir pegylated interferon weekly subcutaneous injection week 48 . Children follow 96 week 48 week discontinuation therapy . Assessment undertaken baseline , week 4 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , &amp; 16 , every 4 week week 48 , week 52 , 56 , 60 , 72 , 84 96 . Data collect describe baseline demographic , symptom liver disease , intercurrent illness , finding physical examination . Blood work drawn measure markers viral liver disease status , assessment drug adverse effect , research biospecimen bank . Participants continue therapy week 48 complete full study follow-up protocol thereafter , include undergo seroconversion anti-HBe anti-HBs reach week 48 . Participants experience sustain elevation ALT eligible receive treatment recommend hepatologist continue complete study follow-up protocol . Participants exhibit adverse effect therapy undergo dose adjustment discontinuation therapy detail protocol , continue complete study follow-up protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Enrolled &amp; complete baseline evaluation NCT01263600 OR complete necessary component NCT01263600 baseline evaluation end baseline visit . 3 &lt; 18 year time randomization ( day 0 ) . Documented chronic HBV infection evidence detection HBsAg serum ≥ 24 week prior baseline OR positive HBsAg negative antiHBc IgM within 24 week baseline visit . Presence HBeAg serum last screening visit within 6 week baseline visit . Serum HBV DNA level &gt; 10^7 IU/mL least 2 occasion least 12 week apart 52 week baseline visit . The HBV DNA level must within 6 week baseline visit . ALT ≤60 U/l male ≤40 U/l female , measure least 2 occasion , screen ( within 6 week prior baseline visit ) &amp; least 12 week prior screen visit &amp; within 52 week prior baseline visit . Compensated liver disease , normal total bilirubin ( except Gilbert 's syndrome ) , direct bilirubin ≤0.5 mg/dL , INR ≤1.5 , serum albumin ≥3.5 g/dL . Creatinine clearance 90 ml/min . Absence hepatocellular carcinoma liver ultrasound past 48 week . Exclusion criterion : Presence infection HCVRNA antiHCV , antiHDV , HIV screen . Presence another cause liver disease HCC ( serum alphafetoprotein &gt; 50ng /ml ) . Evidence decompensated liver disease ( Childs BC ) . History evidence medical condition associate chronic liver disease ( e.g. , hemochromatosis , autoimmune hepatitis , alcoholic liver disease , toxin exposure ) . Females pregnant breastfeeding . Adolescent female unwilling unable use acceptable method contraception sexually active treatment period . Children currently breastfeed mother take lamivudine , expose lamivudine ≥24 week via maternal lamivudine treatment pregnancy and/or breastfeed . Previous liver organ transplantation include engraft bone marrow transplant . Hematological abnormality screen period contraindicate full dosing study drug , e.g absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 10^9 cells/L platelet count &lt; 120 x 10^9 cells/L . Known allergy study drug ; peginterferon alfa2a entecavir . Treatment systemic acyclovir famciclovir within previous 6 month . Need ongoing use antiviral activity HBV course study history receive treatment HBV . Any use illegal drug OR use alcoholic beverage opinion study physician sufficient prevent adequate compliance study procedure increase risk pancreatitis hepatotoxicity . History immunologically mediate disease ( e.g . inflammatory bowel disease , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura , lupus erythematosus , autoimmune haemolytic anemia , scleroderma , severe psoriasis , rheumatoid arthritis ) . History evidence bleed esophageal varix consistent decompensated liver disease . History evidence chronic pulmonary disease associate functional limitation . History significant cardiovascular disease . History severe seizure disorder current anticonvulsant use . History evidence severe retinopathy . History thyroid disease poorly control prescribed medication . Participants elevate thyroid stimulate hormone concentration elevation antibody thyroid peroxidase clinical manifestation thyroid disease exclude . Concomitant use use ≤ 6 month prior first dose study drug antineoplastic , immunosuppressive , nephrotoxic hepatotoxic medication , methadone , theophylline medication may affect renal excretion hepatic metabolism permit . Concomitant use complementary alternative medication purport antiviral activity . A participant may coenrolled another clinical trial investigational drug administer . Any condition situation opinion study physician would make participant unsuitable enrollment could interfere participant participate complete study .</criteria>
