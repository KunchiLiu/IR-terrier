	<brief_summary>The use coronary compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) rapidly increase , lack data support use initial evaluation patient asymptomatic mildly symptomatic . The hypothesis underlie proposal use stress-rest myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) initial test evaluation asymptomatic mildly symptomatic patient intermediate risk coronary event result less non-invasive invasive test result reduce cost , without adversely affect clinical outcome short term .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recently coronary compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) become increasingly popular mean investigate asymptomatic mildly symptomatic patient , instead stress-rest myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) , despite absence long-term prognostic data . With high negative predictive value , CTA become useful exclusion CAD patient chest pain syndrome . However , clinical management patient abnormal CTA well define . Further , several caveat remain regard use coronary CTA . Despite anatomic data provide CTA , yield information regard functional consequence obstruction . Moreover , technique may miss small vessel disease limited resolution may useful presence significant vessel calcium coronary stent . Most importantly , long-term data regard prognostic ability coronary CTA initial evaluation patient intermediate risk coronary event . An abnormal CTA result often lead additional functional test invasive coronary angiography . The major drawback perform two test tandem greatly add cost prohibitive low middle income country . Therefore , need determine either stress MPI CTA perform initially , result meaningful difference cost without adversely affect clinical outcome . The primary objective pilot study compare efficacy ( term reduce additional non-invasive invasive testing ) cost strategy initial stress-rest MPI , strategy initial coronary CTA management asymptomatic mildly symptomatic patient intermediate risk coronary event ( death nonfatal MI ) Framingham criterion .</detailed_description>
