	<brief_summary>This prospective multicenter observational study 20 patient evaluate performance SCITECH stent treatment AAA . Will enrol patient demographic , laboratory test , medical history , clinical evaluation , physical examination , adverse event . The benefit risk study explain specific test procedure study . The write consent must obtain patient . No action specifies study perform patient sign form consent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Study Evaluate Safety Performance Modular AAA Stent-Graft System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until 90 treatment AAA exclusively surgical , present significant risk death , however , many patient could undergo surgery invasive nature procedure . The mortality comorbidity associate significant surgical repair AAAs , particularly elderly patient multiple medical problem . Surgical complication mainly associate surgical incision , comorbidity present patient , change cardiopulmonary problem related clot patient . The postoperative complication include bleeding , renal failure , paraplegy , need prolonged ventilatory support . The literature show mortality rate elective surgery 0-6.1 % , 2.7 % average . Due risk complexity inherent surgical procedure , various device alternative method propose treat aneurysm . The method use today implantation stent delivery system . This method define minimally invasive dispense need open abdominal cavity large incision , use remote access ( common femoral artery external iliac ) introduce deploy device via endovascular route . With technological progress develop many device , similar characteristic , currently use different country . Numerous device currently use treat aneurysm . Over past 10 year , develop approve new stent , however , despite advance represent use minimally invasive device , evidence improvement index morbidity mortality first six month , still need improve result , since long-term endovascular treatment equal conventional surgical treatment . With technological device improve long-term performance obviate need dissection femoral vessel use thinner delivery device allow percutaneous introduction .</detailed_description>
