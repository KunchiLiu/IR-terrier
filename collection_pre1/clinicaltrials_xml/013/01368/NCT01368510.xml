	<brief_summary>Even best available treatment obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , patient partially recover many patient respond . Such incomplete inadequate response contribute great public health cost term morbidity patient care expense . This study aim well understand abnormal brain chemistry OCD affect cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) order develop novel therapy improve success exist therapy . The main hypothesis CBT change level excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate OCD patient region brain involved OCD know cingulate cortex .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study characterize neurochemical abnormality important brain circuit underlie obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) symptoms effect cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) . Identification metabolite biomarkers provide important foundation translational clinical study maximize ability CBT reduce symptom design medication target core feature disease , particularly important respond , access , CBT . OCD often disable chronic psychiatric condition affect approximately 2 % world 's population . Most patient respond incompletely current treatment many respond . CBT , form psychotherapy , one effective treatment OCD , yet mechanism action fully understood . The objective study use neuroimaging understand neurometabolite abnormality neural circuit relate OCD symptom , affect CBT . In OCD , dysfunction suspect several subregions cingulate gyrus , brain region involve relevant neural circuit . This study use magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( MRSI ) measure concentration brain metabolite , include glutamate ( Glu ) , cingulate . Glu important excitatory neurotransmitter suspect disturbed OCD . In study , MRSI scan perform 25 adult OCD patient 4 week daily CBT . They compare 25 untreated healthy control scan 4 week apart . A third group 25 OCD patient scan 4 week waitlist , receive 4 week CBT , scan third time completion . The specific aim study : 1 ) Determine level Glu `` emotional '' `` cognitive '' subregions cingulate differ OCD patient control ; 2 ) Determine Glu change CBT waitlist OCD patient change control simple passage time ; 3 ) Determine relationship Glu clinical neurocognitive symptom OCD CBT .</detailed_description>
