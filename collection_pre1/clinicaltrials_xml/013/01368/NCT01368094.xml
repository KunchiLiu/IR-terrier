	<brief_title>Early ( 4 Days ) Versus Standard Drainage Abdominal Cavity After Pancreaticoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction . Two thousand pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD ) perform per year France ( observatory pancreatectomy GCB 2005 ) . This intervention associate high rate postoperative complication include pancreatic fistula ( PF ) , site infection ( SSI : intra-abdominal abscess , wound infection ) , gastroparesis , hemorrhage . The incidence SSI ( superficial deep ) 35 % seem influence prolonged drainage intra-abdominal . For several year , global trend reduce use abdominal drainage abdominal surgery . Several randomized clinical trial show prophylactic drainage decrease incidence postoperative complication elective hepatectomy , colectomy , cholecystectomy could increase number SSI . However , role prophylactic drainage PD far unclear . In literature , three study examine influence drainage abdominal cavity PD , publish time protocol submit : - The study Conlon et al . ( Ann Surg 2001 ) , prospective randomize study compare drainage standard abdominal drainage . The SSI rate drain group 36 % versus 16 % undrained group ( NS , critical study methodology ) . - The study Kawai et al . ( Ann Surg 2006 ) , non-randomized prospective study compare short drainage ( D4 ) drainage standard ( D8 ) . The SSI rate drain group 38 % versus 7.7 % undrained group ( significant non-randomized study involve patient two consecutive period ) . - Study Berberat et al . ( BÃ¼chler ) ( J Gastrointest Surg 2007 ) , retrospective analysis population patient PD ( 80 % ) result intention treat early removal drainage abdominal cavity . The SSI rate publish study 9.4 % . After acceptance protocol local ethic committee , forth study publish Bassi et al ( Bassi C Ann Surg 2010 ) : randomize control study . Patients underwent pancreatic resection ( include leave pancreatic resection ) low risk postoperative pancreatic fistula randomize post operative day ( POD ) 3 receive either early ( POD 3 ) standard drain removal ( POD 5 beyond ) . The primary end point study incidence pancreatic fistula . This study show , patient low risk pancreatic fistula pancreatic resection , intra-abdominal drain safely remove POD 3 standard pancreatic resection . A prolonged period drain insertion associate high rate postoperative complication increase hospital stay . The aim present prospective randomize multicenter study evaluate influence short drainage ( 4 day ) abdominal cavity versus standard drainage ( 10 15 day , depend staff clinical practice ) PD rate SSI . Materials Methods : The technique PD leave discretion operator well prescription analogue somatostatin . Drainage abdominal cavity make one two round silicone close suction drain open multichannel silicone drain place vicinity pancreatic biliary anastomosis . Shall exclude patient operate chronic pancreatitis patient underwent preoperative radiotherapy . The 3rd postoperative day , pancreatic fistula seek clinically , biologically CT-scanner image . In case pancreatic fistula , patient exclude randomization drainage abdominal cavity leave place depend different team ' practice . Patients without fistula randomize either drainage removal 4 day surgery ( D4 ) standard drainage . Analysis outcome : The primary endpoint occurrence surgical site infection ( SSI ) D30 , define : - surface SSI ( wound abscess ) : infection skin , subcutaneous tissue muscle , fascia , locate surgical incision . The diagnosis base least one follow criterion : - The fluid wound drain locate fascia purulent - A spontaneous dehiscence wind - A positive culture close wound . - deep SSI ( intra-abdominal abscess ) infection operate tissue site intervention ( fascia ) . The diagnosis base least one follow criterion : - The fluid drain position beneath fascia purulent ; - A culture close wound positive ; - Other sign infection direct examination find re-operation . Secondary outcome length hospital stay , postoperative complication , emphasis classification IIIa ( radiological drainage ) IIIb ( re-intervention ) Clavien ( Dindo et al . Ann Surg 2004 ) . All patient underwent PD study period , especially patient exclude randomization collect . Calculating number patient need reduce SSI rate 30 % ( group standard drainage abdominal cavity ) 10 % ( short drainage group ) , risk alpha 0.05 risk beta 0.20 yield 124 patient . Taking account 10 % patient analyzable , number patient include study 138 ( 69 patient arm ) . Five university hospital participate study ( Amiens , Lille , Caen , Rouen ) one general hospital ( CH Beauvais ) . The expected duration study 24 month ( 12-14 patient per center per year ) .</detailed_description>
