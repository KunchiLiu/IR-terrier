	<detailed_description>Background Aortic valve stenosis represent clinically important valvular heart disease elderly patient population . After onset symptom include chest pain , congestive heart failure syncope , prognosis decrease substantially average survival amount 2 3 year without surgical intervention . For several decade , surgical aortic valve replacement consider standard treatment symptomatic patient , result effective symptom relief improvement prognosis . Patients deem excessive-risk conventional aortic valve replacement treat conservatively poor prognosis . In search le invasive treatment option , transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) introduce 2002 . TAVI represent alternative , less invasive treatment option non-operable high-risk patient conventional surgery . TAVI show technically feasible procedural success rate &gt; 90 % several registry . Most recently , randomize , control clinical trial patient deem inoperable , non-inferiority compare surgical aortic valve replacement among patient consider high risk demonstrate superiority TAVI compare medical treatment alone patient deem inoperable conventional aortic valve replacement . The present registry aim assess safety efficacy TAVI CE approve device Swiss cardiovascular center . The Swiss Working group Interventional Cardiology Acute Coronary Syndrome decide establish nationwide registry collaboration Swiss Society Cardiac Surgery order ass procedural clinical outcome TAVI patient . This prospective registry help identify candidate TAVI , report peri-procedural outcome long-term efficacy device . Last least tool increase quality treatment high-risk patient population . Objective The purpose multi-center national registry Switzerland obtain clinical baseline , procedural follow-up data patient treat TAVI Switzerland ass short , mid- long-term clinical outcome data CE approve device . Methods This prospective multi-center , observational registry perform Switzerland . All center Switzerland implant CE approve device TAVI invite consecutively include patient registry . Each center sign agreement patient include registry . Each site collect baseline procedural data well clinical outcome data five year .</detailed_description>
