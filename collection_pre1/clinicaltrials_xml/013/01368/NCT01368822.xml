	<brief_summary>Several study show renal function patient donate kidney ( otherwise healthy ) remain stable within normal limit . However , unclear donor nephrectomy affect patient subset comorbidities , issue become relevant current environment inclusion criterion continuously become less stringent patient consider potential donor . In present study , investigator plan evaluate long-term renal function obese patient donate kidney part live donor renal transplant procedure . The investigator select group high risk develop obesity-related complication diabetes hypertension may impair renal function , rapidly become major subgroup kidney donor population , study systematically follow obese patient kidney donation . Establishment appropriate control group primary importance study examine long-term outcome . The investigator also evaluate 2-kidney control group allow u compare individual interactive effect obesity kidney donation long-term renal function . Study participant complete medical questionnaire , undergo blood pressure measurement , provide blood urine sample analysis various metabolic parameter . Some study participant ambulatory blood pressure monitoring perform involves application automate blood pressure cuff 24 hour . Some study participant also undergo direct measurement glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) iohexol . In proposed research , investigator hypothesize obesity kidney donor increase likelihood develop renal dysfunction risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) may increase likelihood even healthy control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In order meet grow demand live donor kidney , inclusion criterion prospective donor become less selective , allow previously ineligible patient donate kidney . One donor group become increasingly utilized overweight patient . There substantial evidence overweight individual susceptible development renal disease either direct result weight consequence obesity-related co-morbidities diabetes hypertension . In addition , appear even mild renal dysfunction increase risk develop CVD , already common population . Despite finding , little know individual interactive effect obesity donation overall health kidney donor . Our study address question examine effect obesity long-term renal function development cardiovascular risk factor hypertension , dyslipidemia , metabolic syndrome patient donate kidney University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) 5 year ago ( 1967-2006 ) . The control group comprise potential kidney donor UCSF period pass initial medical screening evaluation donate find ABO- crossmatch incompatible . The investigator believe result propose study important develop precise guideline selection long-term health care maintenance kidney donors.maintenance .</detailed_description>
