	<brief_summary>Summary Diseases due T. solium soil transmit helminth ( STHs ) cosmopolitan distribution strongly link poor sanitation poverty . These infection great extent perpetuate open defecation ( OD ) . Community-Led Total Sanitation ( CLTS ) approach people rural community facilitate appraisal analysis , come conclusion , take action . To date rigorous study conduct evaluate impact CLTS transmission taeniasis/cysticercosis STHs , despite worldwide acclaim CLTS receive approach improve sanitation . The overall aim study contribute reduction subsequent control T. solium STH infection implementation CLTS approach 1 district Eastern Province Zambia . By use CLTS hypothesise toilet acquisition usage increase resultant reduction OD turn reduce transmission T. solium STH infection district . This measured porcine/human cysticercosis prevalence ( serological test ) STH infection human ( quantitative coprological test ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study procedure consist conduct pilot study census establish sample frame , shortly follow baseline survey baseline data human cysticercosis , porcine cysticercosis ( serological test ) , STH infection prevalence ( quantitative coprological test ) anthropometric data ( weight , height , arm circumference ) obtain study community ( infected people receive treatment ) . The study community subsequently randomly allocate status intervention control community , determine point CLTS administer , community ultimately receive CLTS . CLTS conduct intervention community 12 month UNICEF . A post-intervention survey follow 12 month CLTS campaign , factor investigate baseline revisit intervention control community . The compliance CLTS approach also measure . CLTS administer control community completion post-intervention survey . Baseline data use show group comparable ; primary analysis difference intervention control follow analyze evaluate impact CLTS . If intervention demonstrate impact occurrence burden sanitation-linked disease , provide advocacy approach policy-maker level .</detailed_description>
