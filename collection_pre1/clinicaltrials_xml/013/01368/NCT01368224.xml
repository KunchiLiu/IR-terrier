	<brief_summary>In recent decade , incidence subject present reactive skin considerably increase industrialized country . Probiotics live microorganism , ingested sufficient amount , beneficial effect human health . The mechanism underlie effect probiotic involves , part , regulation composition and/or metabolic activity intestinal microbiota.. It postulate follow interaction probiotic intestinal epithelium , associate intestinal cell become activate consequently mediator release blood circulation . Mediators , activate intestinal epithelial cell possibly bacterial fraction might reach skin bloodstream potentially could exert effects.The objective study assess effect probiotic reactive skin symptom . The strain Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461 test alone combination strain Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 randomize , double-blind study . The two strain select immune-modulatory property demonstrate vitro preclinical study well pilot clinical trial . Ninety-six woman present reactive skin randomize 3 group : placebo ( n = 32 ) , L. paracasei NCC2461 alone ( n = 32 ) L. paracasei NCC2461 + B. longum NCC3001 ( n = 32 ) . The supplement administer oral route 58 day ( 1010 CFU/day ) . The objective clinical trial determine , vivo , effect food supplement reactive skin symptom ( measure skin sensitivity reconstruction barrier function post-repeated tape strip ) . The secondary objective determine effect food supplement leg skin dryness facial skin roughness associate biochemical , immunological microbiological factor . Accordingly , subject ' skin sensitivity determine capsaicin test . The reconstruction barrier function determine measure trans-epidermal water loss ( TEWL ) post-repeated strip use SERVOMED evaporimeter . A clinical score skin dryness roughness assign dermatologist . The subject also assess leg facial skin dryness . Each analysis conduct various time point . In parallel , assessment skin moisturize factor serum inflammatory immune-regulatory cytokine perform . Finally , key component intestinal microbiota analyze .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The probiotic particularly Lactobacillus paracasei Bifidobacterium longum value respect homeostasis dry sensitive skin . An initial study ( study report No . 1020813 , DERMSCAN date 2/10/2004 ) show combination L. paracasei NCC2461 ( ST11 ) Bifidobacterium lactis NCC2818 ( Bb12 ) induce improvement certain parameter related skin reactivity . However , probiotic test separately . It thus consider important conduct clinical trial aim confirm document data generate previous study , also determine specific efficacy L. paracasei NCC2461 ( ST11 ) reactive skin symptom . The latter probiotic strain select basis proven immune-modulatory property ( scientific dossier ST11-Nestec Benyacoub Gueniche . Scientific evidence support use Lactobacillus paracasei NCC2461 ( ST11 ) Inn√©ov . Report 11.02.2005 reference 23 , 24 , 31-33 ) . The strain combine probiotic Bifidobacterium genus , particularly Bifidobacterium longum NCC3001 . The data generate various preclinical study ( NRC in-house study ) clinical study ( public ) show probiotic strain able modulate immune mechanism could interfere inflammatory reaction . Moreover , probiotic combination concept enable provide potential benefit along gastrointestinal tract , induce maintenance optimum intestinal flora .</detailed_description>
