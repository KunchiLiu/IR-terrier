	<brief_summary>The trial objective compare efficacy relative pain , along route vein follow echoguided endovenous injection sclerotherapeutic foam Great Saphenous vein , class III microfibre compression ( centred 25 mm Hg ) versus class I ( 10-15 mm Hg ) versus class III cotton compression ( 20 36 mm Hg ) 21 day . The main contrast comparison first two group mention . All contrast secondary . The `` Class I compression '' versus `` The two class III compression '' contrast also study . Efficacy measure total VAS score maximum pain experienced since morning evaluate patient end day . Consumption analgesic number day analgesic treatment necessary 3 compression type use compare . One trial objective also show regular use class III compression product lead reduction complication follow sclerosis ( reduce number non-serious/serious complication specific sclerosis : matting , pigmentation , inflammation , development sclerosis require drainage , DVT , pulmonary embolism , etc. ) . The trial also aim compare rate successful sclerosis three device , success define complete partial occlusion great saphenous vein , lead disappearance reflux crural level . The secondary objective patient evaluation comfort , ease put take compression hose global appreciation procedure echoguided endovenous injection sclerotherapeutic foam great saphenous vein , follow wear compression hose .</brief_summary>
