	<brief_summary>Chronic fatigue ( CF ) chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) disable disorder may induce aggravate underlying sleep disturbance . The relationship sleep quality fatigue still fully elucidate . To evaluate effect improved sleep quality fatigue , randomize control cross-over trial nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( nCPAP ) carry patient present primary complaint chronic disable fatigue find apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; = 15 polysomnography ( PSG ) . The aim study address issue Continuous Positive Airway Pressure-responsiveness regard fatigue present symptom CF CFS patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , absence underlie medical psychiatric illness . The answer question may shed light enigmatic relationship sleep fatigue . We also want investigate Continuous Positive Airway Pressure responsiveness regard sleepiness general health target population . Zero-hypothesis : effect .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients primarily refer disabling , unexpected fatigue . According Fukuda criterion , diagnostic workup yield final diagnosis chronic fatigue ( CF ) chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) . 18 &lt; = age &lt; = 65 Polysomnography Test ( PSG ) demonstrate apneahypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; =15 , evidence obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Female patient childbearing potential ( premenopausal female biologically capable become pregnant ) confirm negative pregnancy test start Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) trial employ acceptable method birth control . Written , sign date informed consent must obtain patient . Patient able understand follow requirement study comply . Willing abstain take medication treatment prohibit protocol . Patients primarily refer Excessive Daytime Sleepiness ( EDS ) snore . Fatigue explain medical psychiatric cause . 18 &gt; age &gt; 65 ApneaHypopnea Index ( AHI ) &lt; 15 Body Mass Index ( BMI ) &gt; = 40 , calculate weight ( ) / ( height ( ) ) Â² Parasomnia Severe sleepiness ( Epworth Sleepiness Scale ) ESS &gt; = 16 ( =15 % Chronic fatigue syndrome ( CFS ) population ) Tonsillar hypertrophy ( Friedman grade III IV tonsil ) Signs nasal obstruction , include chronic use topical nasal drug . Earlier CPAP treatment Physical mental disability compromise normal use CPAP CPAP intolerance Current use sedative ( benzodiazepine nonbenzodiazepine GABAesgic agonist ) antidepressant medication time period inferior 3 week . Female patient pregnant , lactate positive pregnancy test result .</criteria>
