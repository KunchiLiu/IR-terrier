	<brief_summary>This research protocol design evaluate novel imaging camera , one three 's kind existence , diagnosis breast cancer . The Molecular Breast Imaging Camera ( MBI ) gamma camera image accumulation 99mTc-Sestamibi , radiopharmaceutical high affinity tissue high cellularity mitochondrial content ; common characteristic breast cancer . This camera represent significant advancement predecessor improve image geometry since direct contact breast tissue improve gamma photon detection capability use cadmium zinc telluride ( CZT ) crystal ( semiconductor material ) instead NaI use standard gamma camera . This project involve image patient baseline population risk breast cancer , refer myocardial perfusion imaging ( MPI ) . This possible 99mTc-sestamibi also use image myocardial tissue . After MPI study perform standard clinical specification , patient simply image MBI . The primary endpoint project assess acceptability image device patient use patient survey . Secondary endpoint correlate finding MBI study standard breast image modality include mammogram , ultrasound , MRI . Image quality evaluate interpreting physician . Also , effort reduce radiation absorbed dose female breast , low inject dose image , obtain post-processing reframing acquire image , assess acceptable image quality diagnostic accuracy .</brief_summary>
