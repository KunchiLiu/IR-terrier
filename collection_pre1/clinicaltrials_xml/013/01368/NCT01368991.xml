	<detailed_description>Purpose : To compare clinical outcome follow sternal closure Kryptonite conventional sternal closure , cardiac surgery patient high risk sternal wound complication . Hypothesis : Patients receive sternal closure Kryptonite short post-operative length stay , few sternal wound complication , improve respiratory function , good quality life , less pain patient receive conventional sternal closure . The investigator hypothesize patient receive sternal closure Kryptonite discharge hospital , average , 1 day earlier patient receive conventional sternal closure . Justification : Kryptonite biologic polymer castor bean non-toxic . It osteoconductive i.e . bone regrow . It adhesive , require 24 hour completely cure , although sternal stability achieve even sooner . In human cadaver study , sternal edge adhere together Kryptonite could break 2 hour . The propose benefit Kryptonite cardiac surgery patient prevention pathologic sternal displacement , elimination regional non-union , enhancement functional recovery , reduction sternal wound complication . The use Kryptonite close sternal wound cardiac surgery first describe Calgary , Alberta . This group conduct small , single-blind randomized clinical trial 34 patient low risk sternal complication ( personal communication , Fedak , P ) . Patients Kryptonite group experience significantly less pain , require less analgesia , demonstrated faster return baseline pulmonary function . The limitation study small sample size blinding patient . Furthermore , hospital length stay evaluate . A multi-center randomized clinical trial plan , pending funding . Objectives : The primary outcome trial quality life . Secondary endpoint pain , sternal complication , respiratory function . Research Method : All patient undergo non-emergent cardiac surgery primary sternotomy Vancouver General Hospital screen enrollment trial . Potentially eligible patient approach research nurse . Forty-eight eligible patient randomize 2:1 intra-operatively receive either conventional sternal closure closure Kryptonite . Sealed envelope treatment allocation utilized randomization process , randomly select operating room . Conventional sternal closure single interrupt figure-of-eight surgical steel wire . Conventional technique vancomycin paste bone wax utilized usual fashion obtain hemostasis patient . Patients Kryptonite group surgical steel wire place usual fashion , prior application Kryptonite . However , bone wax vancomycin paste use Kryptonite group , impair adherent property Kryptonite . Post-operatively , patient make aware type sternal closure receive . Furthermore , post-operative care team Cardiac Surgery Intensive Care Unit ( CSICU ) , well surgical ward also blind . The cardiac surgery ward run single cardiologist blind patient ' group allocation . Battery power sternal saw available CSICU cardiac surgery ward , event emergent resternotomy . All patient follow prospectively . The primary outcome quality life . Secondary outcome hospital length stay , pain , sternal complication , respiratory function . All patient require answer quality life questionnaire pre-operatively ( SF12 ) , well 2 week 5 week post-operatively . Pain scale also administer post-operative day 2 day 5 , day discharge less day 5 . Questionnaires administer research nurse , either hospital phone . Respiratory function measure bedside spirometry , measure pre-operatively , well post-operative day 2 5 . In-hospital sternal complication record , follow discharge research nurse ask sternal complication follow-up telephone call . Sternal complication interest sternal dehiscence require re-operation sternal wound infection require antibiotic re-intervention . Post-operative follow-up otherwise routine . A data safety monitor board assemble perform interim analysis 24 48 patient enrolled trial . If safety risk identify interim analysis , patient randomize trial . Statistical Analysis : Baseline characteristic compare group use Student 's T-tests , continuous variable Chi-square test categorical variable . The physical component score ( PCS ) mental component score ( MCS ) SF-12 compare group baseline use Student 's T-test , change score baseline 2 week baseline 5 week . The investigator also explore change time use three time point , baseline , 2 week , 5 week , use general estimate equation ( GEE ) . Length stay ( LOS ) , change pain score , rate sternal complication , respiratory function also evaluate . LOS report median interquartile range , give high likelihood data significantly skew . Differences group therefore test use Mann-Whitney U test . Pain score measure 2 5 day . The mean standard deviation time point report difference 2 day assess use Student 's T-test . The change pain score 2 5 day also compare use Student 's T-test . The rate sternal complication compare simple proportion use Chi-square test difference . Respiratory function , specifically FEV1 FVC , compare three time point use GEE , thus allow u compare change function time . With exception LOS , investigator assume continuous variable normally distribute . Outcomes tested normality assumption prior carry parametric test . If variable normally distribute , either log transformation apply nonparametric test ( ie . Wilcoxon rank-sum test ) consider test difference group .</detailed_description>
