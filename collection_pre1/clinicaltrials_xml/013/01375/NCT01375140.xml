	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination ruxolitinib lenalidomide help control MF . The safety study drug combination also study . Ruxolitinib design stop certain protein ( call JAK1 JAK2 ) find MF cell send signal may lead growth cancer cell . Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . This may decrease growth cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , begin take ruxolitinib mouth 2 time every day 28-day cycle . You take ruxolitinib one time morning one time evening ( 12 hour apart ) . Ruxolitinib take meal glass water . If miss dose ruxolitinib , make dose take next schedule dose . You also take lenalidomide mouth one time morning Days 1-21 cycle . Lenalidomide capsule swallow whole , broken , chew , open . If dose lenalidomide miss , take soon possible day . If missed entire day , make . If study doctor think need side effect , dose ruxolitinib and/or lenalidomide may stop , lower , delay 8 week study . During study , need return unused study drug study staff clinic visit . Additional Drugs : If disease respond study drug 3 cycle study doctor think best interest , may begin take prednisone along study drug . Prednisone corticosteroid similar natural hormone make body . Prednisone often give combination chemotherapy drug . You take prednisone every morning Cycles 4 5 , every day Cycle 6 . After Cycle 6 , long take prednisone . If forget take prednisone 8 hour pass , wait next day take prednisone ( 2 day later take every day Cycle 6 ) . If doctor think need , may take aspirin study help prevent blood clot form . If allergic aspirin take aspirin , doctor may recommend take another type drug help prevent blood clot form . Study Drug Diary : You give study drug diary begin take study drug write time take dose study drug . You need bring diary study visit review . You bring study drug ( include empty bottle ) study visit . You ask take morning dose study drug visit Day 15 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycle 2 . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycles 1 2 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test check kidney liver function . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test able become pregnant . - You complete 2 questionnaire quality life . The questionnaire take 10 minute complete . One questionnaires may fill computer . The study staff help use computer . On Days 8 22 Cycles 1 2 : ° Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test able become pregnant .

This routine blood draw include pregnancy test able become pregnant . On Day 1 Cycle 3 every 3 6 Cycles : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You review blood transfusion may last 3 month . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test check kidney liver function . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test able become pregnant . - You complete 2 questionnaire quality life . The questionnaire take 10 minute complete . You bone marrow biopsy aspirate Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , doctor feel necessary . Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) System : During first 3 cycle , use Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) system month tell study staff side effect may . The IVR system automate call system allow press button phone answer question side effect may . The study staff give instruction use IVR . If able use IVR system , member study staff contact instead . After Cycle 3 , member study staff call home month ask side effect may review result blood test . Length Study : You may receive study drug combination 6 year . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You consider study follow-up visit . End-of-Study Visit : You end-of-study visit day take study . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You review blood transfusion may last 3 month . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test check kidney liver function . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test able become pregnant . - You complete 2 questionnaire quality life . The questionnaire take 10 minute complete . - You bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate check status disease . Follow-up : A member study staff call 30 day 60 day stop take study drug ask feel side effect since last visit . This investigational study . Lenalidomide FDA-approved commercially available use patient MF . Ruxolitinib FDA approve commercially available treatment intermediate high-risk myelofibrosis , include primary myelofibrosis , post-polycythemia vera ( post-PV ) myelofibrosis post-essential thrombocythemia ( post-ET ) myelofibrosis . Lenalidomide FDA-approved treatment form myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Its use patient MF investigational . Up 49 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
