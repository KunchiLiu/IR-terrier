	<detailed_description>Background : Heart Failure ( HF ) significant healthcare concern US , 120 % rise mortality rate 15 year cost country estimate $ 37.2 billion 2009 . Veterans currently impact rate 5.2 % , cost average $ 14,959/individual/year utilizing VA 's Healthcare service . Research show exercise training ( ET ) improve aerobic capacity , endothelial dysfunction , quality life , ability tolerate activity within overall HF population . Animal model emerge explain underlying mechanism pathologic expression symptom link ET . A translational link yet explore animal model human symptom expression . Objectives : The long-term goal research program develop exercise training ( ET ) program effectively decrease fluid shift variability HF patient , safely implement home environment remotely monitor healthcare provider within nurse-lead HF Clinic . The purpose propose research project determine ET alters fluid status patient HF compare standard treatment care . The central hypothesis combine weight-bearing aerobic resistance ET protocol reduce ( stabilize ) 24-hour weight bioelectrical impedance pattern variability , evaluate via mixed-effects regression modeling , great form ET protocol . Methods : Design : Using establish experimental design technique implement innovative manner , between-group design use within experimental arm employ single subject , multiple-baseline design . The use technique allow subject control , also allow statistical group comparison . Subjects Setting : 60 subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol VA HF Clinic outpatient VA cardiology clinic within 50 mile Columbia , South Carolina . Subjects randomize exercise usual care group . Procedures : The exercise protocol last 12 week , subject randomize order ET . Weight-bearing aerobic ET walking treadmill ; non-weight-bearing aerobic ET stationary bicycling ; resistance ET low body isolation ET . Fluid stability concept day-to-day variability movement intra-cellular fluid extra-cellular space . Fluid stability assess use 24-hour weight bioelectrical impedance quantify statistically use mixed effect model . Data Analysis : Statistical analysis utilize longitudinal mixed-effects regression model , model variability time subject individually , well within group . Additionally , main effect ( time group ) interaction effect ( time group ) assess . Status : Funding begin September 1 , 2010 . The study transfer Dorn VAMC Columbia , SC March 2011 . Currently study final phase data analysis .</detailed_description>
