	<brief_summary>Background : - Studies show animal monkey dog excellent sight touch memory perform poorly sound memory task . Human brain certain area important speak understanding language . These area may involve sound spoken word memory . Researchers want study area brain find memory sound require brain structure usually associate language learn unique human . Objectives : - To use magnetic resonance imaging study area brain involve sound memory . Eligibility : - Healthy right-handed volunteer 18 50 year age . They must native English speaker complete high school . Design : - The study require screen visit 1 2 study visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - At screen visit , volunteer medical history take . They also physical neurological exam , complete questionnaire . Women childbearing age give urine sample . Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan past year one visit . - At second visit , participant test sound memory . They listen set nonsense word speak earphone memorize word . Then listen word judge word part earlier list . Participants 1 hour break , sound memory test . During second test repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , stimulate different region brain . - If group result test session positive , third visit . At visit , participant sound perception test . They listen word speak earphone judge whether word pair different . Participants rTMS test well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Humans animal use language communicate . Among many requirement , human need excellent auditory long-term memory able master complicate task learning language . It still completely understood brain region involve transfer auditory stimuli long-term memory . The goal research proposal examine whether brain structure know essential language production also play important role encode auditory stimuli long-term memory . Study population : We propose use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) examine role frontal temporo-parietal cortical area storage auditory stimuli long-term memory . The whole study comprise three experiment . Each three experiment consist one three session . Sessions 1 2 compulsory every experiment . Session 3 require positive result obtain session 2 . Every participant participate one three plan experiment . In Experiment 1 , investigate potential role Broca area auditory memory . If find rTMS Broca area interfere performance memory task , conduct control ( session 3 ) determine whether impairment actually due interference stimulus perception rather memory , per se . We conduct Experiment 2 investigate possible role Wernicke region auditory memory . We conduct Experiment 3 investigate role ventral premotor cortex ( PMv ) auditory memory . In experiment 2 3 also conduct control session 3 , Experiment 1 rTMS impairs performance auditory memory task . All experiment consist two session additional , third session rTMS-induced impairment find . In case participant call back control experiment . During session 1 , neurological examination perform clinical , anatomical , functional MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) take ( functional MRI second repeat experiment 1 experiment 3 ) . In session 2 , rTMS use attempt temporarily disrupt function Broca area ( experiment 1 ) , TPJ ( experiment 2 ) PMv ( experiment 3 ) participant perform auditory recognition memory task . By temporarily disrupt cortical function localized region , able determine whether function crucial encode auditory stimuli long-term memory . In control session , conduct experimental task yield positive result ( i.e. , impairment ) , test auditory perception ask participant make same/different judgment stimulus pair ( similar use session 2 ) present short delay use rTMS routine session 2 . By amendment , wish expand session 1 include functional MRI ( fMRI ) imaging design identify refine target disruption rTMS subsequent session : Broca area ( experiment 1 ) , PMv ( experiment 3 ) . Specifically , intend ( 1 ) repeat Experiment 1 approve protocol use fMRI localization additional 15 subject , ( 2 ) proceed Experiment 3 describe original protocol , also addition fMRI localization . Initial result experiment 1 ( Broca area ) fell short significance , possibly anatomical landmark inconsistent subject ( e.g. , Amunts et al. , 1999 ) ; fMRI localizer subject could reduce variability . Unlike previous protocol , session 1 skip subject neurological exam MRI past year ( exam may skip , subject need fMRI ) . The maximum number session per experiment remain unchanged three : 1 ) intake exam anatomical/functional MRI , 2 ) rTMS , 3 ) control session significant effect rTMS observe . By amendment , also wish consider three experiment independent , rather contingent outcome previous experiment ( ) . As outlined ( section 2.3-2.5 ) , experimental evidence implicates three region auditory-motor network study . Preliminary evidence indicate positive effect experiment 2 ( TPJ ) , render experiment 3 moot . Therefore wish apply fMRI-targeted rTMS Broca area , PMv , independent experiment . Outcome measure : In session 2 , primary outcome measure number correctly remember auditory stimulus . Secondary output reaction time recognition phase experiment . In control experiment ( conduct ) primary outcome measure number correct same/different judgment , , reaction time secondary measure .</detailed_description>
