Improvements drug treatment therefore require . There recent increase understanding cause frequent lack complete response see antidepressant . The stress hormone , cortisol , often elevate poorly control depression laboratory clinical research show hormonal change reduce benefit antidepressant associated poor outcome memory problem . Recently show small study give treatment reduce cortisol block harmful effect 1 3 week overcome negative consequence . Our group particularly interested experience topic . The investigator plan study drug decrease cortisol level people recover standard antidepressant investigator find usefulness treatment ( compare placebo ( dummy tablet ) ) day day life well check closely side-effects ( initial study show particular drug investigator wish study ( metyrapone ) side effect ) . The investigator also measure cortisol see level tell u people best treatment . The investigator carry study 3 centre across UK . The investigator carry additional test specific sort memory decision making also scan brain ( painless test ) . The result test , along test brain wave pattern , help u understand fully new treatment work responds best . The study help u find drug use widely people respond standard treatment also lead development new treatment anti-cortisol effect help tackle major problem poor outcome depression .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patient 1 . Depression Severity : Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS17 ) score ≥18 , consistent moderate severe episode . The stability patient 's clinical state also assess week 0 . A repeat HDRS17 score time 0 require ≥18 great . 2 . Treatment refractoriness : assess use Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) stag method . This define minimum effective dos currentlyavailable antidepressant `` adequate trial '' least six week . For trial consider `` failure '' , must consider clinical team ineffective rather , drug take tolerated . Patients must fail respond least second trial antidepressant . This equate minimum score two MGH stag . The maximum MGH score inclusion study 10 . A UK study show mean MGH score primary care patient less one , secondary care mental health setting around five 11 population patient refer tertiary centre ( Dr D Christmas , Dundee , Personal Communication ) . 3 . Current antidepressant treatment : patient must take monotherapy combination antidepressant therapy include serotonergic drug ( SSRI , tertiary amine tricyclic , venlafaxine , duloxetine mirtazapine ) . They must noradrenergic antidepressant monotherapy ( e.g . lofepramine , imipramine reboxetine ) . At point randomisation , patient must current antidepressant medication , current dose , minimum four week . 4 . Age : 1865 . For mechanistic substudies patient upper age limit 60 . Healthy Control 1 . Aged 1860 . 2 . Currently psychiatrically well , confirm SCID interview . HDRS17 score ≤5 , current psychotropic medication . 3 . No past history psychiatric illness , reveal SCID interview , require treatment ( formal psychotherapy psychotropic medication ) . 4 . No first degree family history psychiatric illness . Patient 1 .

Dependence alcohol drug past 12 month , and/or current harmful use alcohol drug . 7 . Recently take part another research study could interfere result one . Healthy Control 1 . Any physical ill health would render use Metyrapone inappropriate , include untreated hypothyroidism , disorder steroid production , current , severe cardiac failure , current , severe frequent angina , current renal failure , myocardial infarction within last year . NOTE : healthy control NOT treat Metyrapone . 2 . Pregnancy , determine history , indicate , urine pregnancy test . 3 . Mothers breastfeed . 4 .
