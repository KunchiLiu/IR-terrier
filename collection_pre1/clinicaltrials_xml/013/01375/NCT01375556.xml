	<brief_summary>Background : - Previous research show person gene influence respond alcohol . But researcher yet know gene might involve . Objectives : - To identify gene relate non-alcoholic individual respond alcohol . Eligibility : - Healthy people 21 30 year age history alcohol drug dependence . Design : - The study require one two 9-hour visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - Participants must take medicine ( except birth-control pill woman ) least 3 day visit . They must drink alcohol least 2 day visit . - Screening include medical history , physical exam , urine test drug abuse . - Participants give alcohol 2.5 hour . This effect three four drink . Frequent breathalyzer test check breath alcohol level infusion . - Before infusion , participant complete questionnaire mood feeling . Other test study think , balance , judgment , risk-taking . Blood sample collect four time infusion . - Participants breakfast start visit ( around 8:00 AM ) . They snack start alcohol infusion ( around 10:45 AM ) . Lunch serve alcohol infusion complete ( around 2:20 PM ) . After test , study stay Clinical Center breath alcohol level fall 0.02 % . This take 2.5 hour . A final blood sample drawn time . Participants able drive home study visit . Also , take medicine operate machinery least 2 hour leave NIH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous research , include prior study use alcohol clamp , show substantial genetic influence alcohol pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics . While influence several individual gene alcohol pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics examine , comprehensive evaluation genetic influence pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics alcohol human . Objectives : To evaluate genetic underpinnings pharmacodynamics alcohol use candidate gene analysis measure initial adaptive acute response alcohol human . Study Population : Subjects 21-30 year-old non-smoking , male female non-dependent drinker good health , determine medical history , physical exam , ECG lab test . Subjects Axis-I psychiatric diagnosis , include alcohol substance dependence , exclude . Design : The study conduct two phase . In phase I , 40 subject ( 20 positive family history alcoholism ( FHP ) 20 family history alcoholism ( FHN ) ) undergo two ethanol infusion session compare different breath alcohol concentration exposure . In one session ( Clamp session ) , participant infuse 6 % ethanol saline use individualized infusion profile achieve clamp breath alcohol concentration ( BrAC ) 60 mg % 2 hour . In session ( Oral-mimic session ) , participant infuse 6 % ethanol saline use another individualized infusion profile achieve BrAC-time profile would typically obtain oral administration ( ascend limb peak BrAC follow descend limb ) . During session , serial BrACs obtain , heart-rate skin blood flow continuously record . A battery subjective ( self-rating questionnaire ) objective measure ( psychomotor performance , behavioral disinhibition task ) obtain baseline two point infusion assess initial response adaptive response alcohol . The measure initial response adaptive response compare session determine provide great sensitivity ( high effect size ) detect family history difference . In phase II , 160 participant undergo one session study . Participants receive ethanol infusion achieve BrAC-time profile ( Clamp Oral-mimic ) provide great sensitivity family history alcoholism phase I study . The battery subjective objective measure obtain assess initial response adaptive response alcohol . These response measure use endophenotypes examination genetic association set candidate gene , base previous clinical pre-clinical study . Outcome measure : Initial response alcohol adaptive response alcohol measure obtain battery assessment , include subjective rating alcohol effect , psychomotor performance , behavioral disinhibition task autonomic measure .</detailed_description>
