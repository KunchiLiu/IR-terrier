	<brief_summary>Background : - MRSA type bacteria cause serious health problem . It cause severe infection difficult treat . MRSA find high number people work kind livestock , pig . Researchers want study people rural area , people work around livestock . They want see MRSA common cause serious infection area . Objectives : - To look relationship livestock handling ( especially pig ) MRSA bacteria people rural area . Eligibility : - Participants Agricultural Health Study Iowa , include expose livestock . - Healthy volunteer expose livestock . Design : - This study require initial visit monthly follow-up survey 18 month . - At first visit , participant throat nose swab collect cell bacteria sample . They also complete questionnaire health habit . Other question ask work brings contact livestock like cow , pig , chicken . - Every month next 17 month , participant complete another questionnaire record change health livestock contact information . They also collect throat nose swab . They send questionnaire swab study researcher . - Participants pay first visit every monthly survey swab collection return . - No treatment give part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study understand epidemiology antibiotic-resistant S. aureus , include methicillin resistant S. aureus ( MRSA ) , outside hospital environment . Our objective characterize epidemiology S. aureus rural community , focus person contact livestock . We achieve carry two parallel prospective cohort study Iowa , examine 1 ) individual enrol Agricultural Health Study , include raise swine ; 2 ) match population-based group livestock exposure . We partner state microbiological diagnostic laboratory order collect isolate symptomatic S. aureus infection . Our central hypothesis individual work close proximity livestock poultry risk occupational exposure MRSA . We hypothesize farmer contact livestock ( swine particular ) likely colonize swine-associated S. aureus strain individual without contact . Finally , expect see typical human strain S. aureus ( include USA300 ) well animal-associated strain ( ST398 ) cause infection Iowans . Our rationale successful completion provide opportunity institute early warning system evaluate emerge S. aureus strain , allow potential intervention prior widespread dissemination human population . We test central hypothesis accomplish objective application pursue follow specific aim : 1 . Establish prevalence , molecular subtypes , antibiotic resistance profile S. aureus population rural Iowans , determine risk factor colonization . We hypothesize individual contact swine likely carry MRSA individual lack exposure ; swine worker frequently colonize swine-associated strain ST398 ; S. aureus isolates collect livestock farmer frequently demonstrate resistance antibiotic include methicillin tetracycline isolates collect individual lack livestock exposure . 2 . Determine incidence molecular epidemiology symptomatic S. aureus infection rural Iowans . We hypothesize symptomatic infection uncommon cohort relative colonization , majority infection skin soft tissue infection . We hypothesize majority infection cohort elsewhere state cause common strain ( include USA300 ) , infection also cause animal-associated strain , include ST398 .</detailed_description>
