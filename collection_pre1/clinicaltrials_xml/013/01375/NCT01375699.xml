	<brief_title>Doxorubicin With Without Sildenafil , With Analysis Cardiac Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Definitive study sildenafil enhancement anthracycline anticancer effect cardioprotection would require randomized , placebo-controlled trial involve large number patient many year follow-up . It appropriate demonstrate concurrent administration sildenafil doxorubicin safe tolerable . Second , definitive study might helpful incorporate early marker cardiac injury order gain early insight cardioprotective effect , establish marker . As correlative study , multiple intermediate marker test . In order investigate candidate marker appropriate study patient receive doxorubicin alone , early marker injury may apparent patient treated combination . In order accomplish two goal trial randomize trial involve sildenafil/doxorubicin group doxorubicin group .</detailed_description>
