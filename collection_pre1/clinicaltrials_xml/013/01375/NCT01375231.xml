	<brief_summary>The investigator posit would advantageous reproduce height entire patellofemoral joint order maintain lever arm quadriceps mechanism preoperative level . Failure may cause quadriceps mechanism inefficient . For example quadriceps mechanism would work hard total patellofemoral ( PF ) height diminish . Alternatively , diminished motion increase patellar strain may occur overall PF height increase . The investigator theorize either sizing error could lead anterior knee pain . The purpose study compare clinical outcome two surgical technique : 1 ) technique reproduce total PF joint side articulation ( Group 1 ) 2 ) traditional technique reproduce patellar thickness one side joint ( Group 2 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There consensus source anterior pain efficacious treatment . Multiple etiology theorize concern cause problem include tibiofemoral instability , patellofemoral ( PF ) instability , PF maltracking patella stress fracture . It report patellofemoral force associate anterior knee pain . Moreover , report correlation exists tension quadriceps muscle force patella . In biomechanical , cadaver study , Browne et al . find longer extensor moment arm reduce tension quadriceps reduce patellar force .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients present primary total knee replacement fail conservative medical management . 2 . Total knee replacement include patella resurface . 3 . Patient willing able understand , sign , date study specific patient informed consent , volunteer participation study . 4 . Patient psychosocially , mentally , physically able comply requirement study include postop clinical evaluation completion questionnaire . 1 . Patients present unicompartmental knee replacement . 2 . Patients present revision total knee replacement . 3 . Total knee replacement include patella resurfacing . 4 . Patients angular deformity great 15 degree . 5 . Patients subluxation/dislocation patella . 6 . Patients severe patellar bone loss .</criteria>
