	<brief_summary>Oral polio rotavirus vaccine significantly less effective child live develop world . Tropical enteropathy , associate intestinal inflammation , decreased absorption increase permeability , may contribute substantially oral vaccine failure develop country setting . Other possible cause oral vaccine underperformance include malnutrition , interference maternal breastmilk antibody , change gut microbiota , genetic susceptibility . Primary Objective : determine whether tropical enteropathy impairs efficacy oral polio rotavirus vaccine child Bangladesh . Secondary Objectives : 1 ) determine impact inactivate polio vaccine ( IPV ) boost efficacy oral polio vaccine 2 ) determine efficacy oral rotavirus vaccine prevent rotavirus diarrhea The polio rotavirus randomize clinical trial embed secondary objective within exploratory study tropical enteropathy .
