	<brief_summary>Background : - TRC105 experimental cancer drug . It design slow stop growth tumor . It prevent growth new blood vessel fee tumor . People hepatocellular carcinoma ( liver cancer ) sometimes respond standard treatment . This include cancer drug sorafenib . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness TRC105 treat liver cancer respond standard therapy . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age hepatocellular carcinoma ( liver cancer ) respond standard therapy . Participants also eligible liver transplant . - No anticoagulation therapy allow exception low-dose aspirin . - No history bleed disorder , peptic ulcer disease gastritis . Design : - Participants physical exam medical history . They also blood urine test , image study . - Participants receive TRC105 week . They also two daily dos steroid day treatment . This help prevent know side effect . - Participants monitor blood urine test . They also image study every two month study effect drug tumor growth . - Participants continue TRC105 long severe side effect liver cancer stop grow shrink . After stop TRC105 , yearly visit physical exam blood test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TRC105 Liver Cancer That Has Not Responded Sorafenib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Worldwide , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common malignancy median survival 6-9 month . The Study Heart Renal Protection ( SHARP ) study establish Sorafenib standard consideration disease set bar future study systemic therapy . There standard therapy patient whose disease progress despite Sorafenib therapy . - TRC105 chimeric , anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody bind CD105 , transmembrane receptor overexpressed proliferate endothelial cell . TRC105 bind CD105-expressing endothelial cell mediate growth inhibition , apoptosis antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . Objectives : Primary : -To evaluate time tumor progression ( TTP ) TRC105 HCC . Secondary : - To evaluate safety TRC105 HCC . - To evaluate immunogenicity TRC105 measure human antichimeric antibody ( HACA ) human antimouse antibody formation . - To evaluate anti-tumor response determine standard European Association Study Liver ( EASL ) -modified Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) response criterion . - To perform correlative study assess potential biomarkers response TRC105 . Eligibility : - Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis HCC . - Childs-Pugh A B ( 7 point ) cirrhosis allow . - Patients must disease amenable potentially curative resection . - Patients must progress intolerant prior sorafenib therapy . - No history bleed varix ( unless subsequent liver transplant ) . All patient must endoscopic evaluation within 6 month start study . - No history bleed varix previous 1 year ( unless subsequent liver transplant ) . No anti-coagulation ( except low-dose aspirin ) . Design : - This single-arm phase II study TRC105 patient HCC . - TRC105 administer intravenous infusion every two week . Patients re-staged every 8 week . - The primary endpoint study Time Tumor Progression ( TTP ) . The primary purpose study evaluate ability TRC105 second line treatment improve upon time progression ( TTP ) patient refractory HCC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histopathological confirmation Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) Laboratory Pathology National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) prior enter study . Or histopathological confirmation carcinoma set clinical radiological characteristic , together pathology , highly suggestive diagnosis HCC . Patients must disease amenable potentially curative resection ablative technique . In addition , disease must amenable transhepatic arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) . Patients may prior TACE disease progression follow . Patients must consider potential candidate liver transplantation . This determination make hepatobiliary surgical input NCI multidisciplinary conference . All patient enrol require measurable disease . If liver cirrhosis present , patient must ChildPugh A classification . Patients must progress intolerant prior sorafenib therapy . Patients must cirrhosis esophagogastric endoscopy within previous 6 month prior study entry assessment varix . If patient do must willing undergo procedure prior study entry . Age great equal 18 year Life expectancy great 3 month . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL Platelets great equal 60,000/mcL Total bilirubin less equal 3 time upper normal limit Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal 10 time upper limit normal Creatinine le equal 1.5 time upper normal limit OR creatinine clearance great equal 40 mL/min/1.73 m^2 patient creatinine level institutional normal , calculated Cockcroft Gault formula . Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy , include surgery . Toxicity less equal grade 1 return baseline . Patients must invasive malignancy within past 3 year ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , carcinoma situ cervix noninvasive bladder cancer ) . Enrolled patient must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation 3 month end treatment . Patient must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients chemotherapy , large field radiotherapy , major surgery must wait 4 week prior enter study ( 2 week sufficient targeted systemic therapy provide toxicity recover less equal grade 1 ) . Patients may receive anticancer agent approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) within past 4 week . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Proteinuria , demonstrate 24 hour protein great equal 2000 mg. Urine protein screen urine proteincreatinine ratio ( UPC ) . For urine proteintocreatinine ( UPC ) ratio &gt; 1.0 , 24hour urine protein need obtain level &lt; 2000 mg patient enrollment . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , hypertension ( systolic blood pressure ( BP ) 160 , diastolic BP &gt; 100 ) , ongoing active systemic infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . No anticoagulation therapy allow exception lowdose aspirin . No bleed diathesis . Patients history bleed varix previous 1 year exclude ( unless patient subsequently liver transplant ) . Those gastric varix varix deem high risk endoscopist place appropriate medical therapy advise gastroenterologist . History peptic ulcer disease hemorrhagic gastritis within 6 month TRC105 administration , unless patient received adequate treatment peptic ulcer disease hemorrhagic gastritis evidence complete resolution document esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) . Mild gastritis allow . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 500 msec . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive patient receive antiretroviral therapy exclude study due possibility pharmacokinetic interaction antiretroviral medication TRC105 . HIV positive patient receive antiretroviral therapy exclude due possibility TRC105 may worsen condition likelihood underlying condition may obscure attribution adverse event respect TRC105 .
