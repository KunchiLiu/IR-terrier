	<brief_title>Nasogastric Tube Insertion Using Midazolam Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our overall objective improve patient satisfaction nasogastric ( NG ) tube placement ( placement flexible tube nose stomach ) emergency department . Placement NG tube stomach often perform emergency department ( ED ) set evacuate air , blood , content . Generally perform nursing staff bedside emergency department , procedure may produce significant pain discomfort patient despite typical measure include local medication constrict numb nasal mucosa . In one questionnaire emergency department patient large university hospital , placement NG tube report painful procedure , ahead fracture reduction , abscess drainage , urethral catheterization ( Singer et al . 1999 ) . The typical medication use placement NG tube placement administration local , topical medication ; use intravenous drug improve patient tolerance procedure vary widely clinical practice ( Juhl Conners 2005 ) . Midazolam ( Versed ) FDA-approved agent procedural sedation , use frequently institution placement NG tube emergency department . In experience , facilitate placement relax muscle , thereby decrease gag , anxiolytic amnestic property improve patient satisfaction . However , publish study midazolam NG tube placement ED setting . The investigator perform randomize controlled trial determine single 2mg unit midazolam dose administer intravenously decrease discomfort patient undergo nasogastric tube placement emergency department . Adult emergency department patient require NG tube screen follow informed consent randomly assign receive either midazolam saline control . Medications provide pharmacy . Registered nurse perform placement administer medication ; researcher , nurse subject blind treatment arm . Following procedure , subject ask assess level discomfort complete brief researcher-assisted questionnaire experience . The nurse also complete questionnaire address difficulty procedure , level success , occurrence unanticipated problem adverse event . This study may provide support clinical practice improve care patient require NG tube placement ED .</detailed_description>
