	<brief_summary>Background : - The purpose study identify change gene cause human disease . We would like obtain child DNA test change gene may contribute disease family . Objective : -To allow exomic genomic sequencing NICHD patient family member order identify change gene cause contribute specific disease . Eligibility : - Children enrol NICHD clinical study condition study may genetic cause . - Family member child eligible study . Design : - Children family member supply DNA sample . If sample already available , DNA need . - If DNA available , sample either blood skin take . - We use samples new DNA sequence technology look human gene know . This known exome genome sequencing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Next Generation Identify Genetic Causes Disease Patients Participating NICHD Clinical Protocols</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over last year advancement DNA sequence technology progress significantly . It feasible economical sequence exome ( know gene ) entire genome . This technological advance apply identifying genetic cause rare diseases traditional method map frequently fail due insufficient number case . These case often present context NICHD research protocol , teach protocol , would efficient individual investigator write new protocol . It also serve standardize consent document across NICHD investigator include exomic/genomic sequencing protocol .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Proband enrol NICHD clinical protocol suspicion underlie genetic cause disease evaluate . 2 . Family member proband eligible protocol . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Normal volunteer unrelated proband disease interest .</criteria>
