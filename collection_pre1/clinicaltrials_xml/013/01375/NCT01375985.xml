	<detailed_description>Influenza A , member Orthomyxoviridae family , compose negative-sense , single-stranded segment ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) genome . An urgent need exist new form treatment influenza A base ( ) know propensity virus undergo continuous low-level antigenic drift less frequent unpredictable major antigenic shift lead pandemic disease , ( b ) clear failure vaccination , even strain reasonably match , prevent influenza-related illness significant proportion vaccine recipient , ( c ) increase frequency resistance approve form therapy influenza ( eg , adamantane derivative , recently , NA inhibitor , oseltamivir ) . AVI-7100 experimental phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense oligomers positive charge select subunit ( PMOplusâ„¢ ) . AVI-7100 specifically target viral messenger RNA sequence . The present study design characterize safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics escalate single-administration dos AVI-7100 healthy human subject .</detailed_description>
