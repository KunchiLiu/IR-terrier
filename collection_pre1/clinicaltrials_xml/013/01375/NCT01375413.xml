	<detailed_description>Purpose : The ability perform two task together - instance walk talk - impaired Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) . As result , dual tasking might evoke gait deterioration increase risk fall PD . In European guideline physiotherapy , therefore recommend advise PD patient avoid dual tasking . However , base clinical experience pilot work argue rather avoid , dual tasking train may enhance safety . At present , little clinical evidence effectiveness attention-related exercise PD . The RESCUE-trial showed sustain reduction dual task interference short period combine single dual task cue gait training without increase fall risk . These effect cue-related contrasted active control group . Dual task training variable locus attention show effective comparison single task training achieve retention transfer effect balance-impaired old people . This randomize study also show dual tasking lead great improvement cognitive function compare single task intervention . In addition , recent study show dual task training surprisingly effective mild moderately affect patient dementia , randomly assign dual task unspecific exercise . Given positive effect clinical study , effectiveness dual task training need urgently address PD patient , motor cognitive problem apparent . The fact patient freeze gait ( FOG ) associate surplus decline attention high fall risk , begs question whether dual task training equally effective important clinical subgroup . Therefore , propose obtain high level evidence whether dual task gait train effective safe PD-patients FOG . The overall purpose project guide future direction innovative rehabilitation target . Research objectives : 1 . To determine whether intensive integrate dual task gait train lead sustain improvement complex gait performance effective consecutive task training . The study focus influence ability resist dual task interference , ability transfer learn effect untrained related task ability retain learn increment period without training ( 12 week ) . 2 . To test whether integrated train dual task walk safe intervention PD increase fall risk . 3 . To determine whether disease stage disease profile ( without FOG ) cognitive factor predict effect dual task training . Design : The design consist multicentered single blind randomized control trial PD patient either allocate control group ( Consecutive Task Training , `` CTT '' ) experimental group ( Integrated Dual Task Training , `` IDT '' ) . Patients arm study continue usual care ( include standard physiotherapy ) normal . In case patient receive physiotherapy , inform therapist involve make sure ascertain content normal care avoid overlap . The trial conduct two country Belgium Netherlands , similar term language healthcare facility . Randomization : The overall timeline study 3 year . Subjects undergo control period six week without intervention . This allow u investigate effect repeat measure . Subsequently , patient randomize one two group within center : 1 ) IDT 2 ) CTT . All subject participate intensive , progressive training protocol consist 18 session ( 3 per week 6 week ) one hour per session . Assessors unaware group allocation . Randomization stratify respect subgroup ( i.e . without FOG Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage II III ) ensure adequate representation diversity . A computerized block randomization perform per centre . Freezers define score &gt; 1 New Freezing Gait Questionnaire . Power calculation : Based literature previous experience , anticipate DTT improve average 20 % STT 5 % baseline dual task gait speed ( novel task ) . Assuming alpha 0.05 , calculate sample size dual task gait speed main outcome . On basis RESCUE data , ( include patient &gt; 5 % DT interference ) find mean dual task gait speed 0.766 m/s SD=0.21 . Based figure estimate total sample size would N=108 ( 54 per centre ) . Incorporating loss follow-up 5 % bring final figure 60 patient per centre recruit period two year ( N=120 ) . Intervention : Integrated dual task training conduct home physiotherapist , especially trained intervention . It consist gait training ( straight-line gait , turn manoeuvre round house ) use standardise cognitive exercise protocol MP3 player . To address correct level learning , level task complexity match patient 's baseline characteristic , consider follow component : baseline DT interference , previous fall risk presence FOG . Given cognitive deterioration PD , imply reduce learning capacity , fix priority training ( attention priority task ) implement , aim improve good safe walking distract attention demand . Every session also include train functional dual task , relevant patient . Progression treatment standardize . Treatment consist 18 session period 6 week . Homework conduct partner safety reason . Intervention additional regular care ( include physiotherapy ) . A follow-up period 12 week without training use test retention . Consecutive task training conduct home physiotherapist . It consist traditional gait training ( straight-line gait , turn maneuvering ) . Patients get separate training cognitive task sit , use program via MP3 player describe . Every session also include train functional task , relevant patient , dual tasking positively discourage . Functional training thus consist carry task component separately . Progression intensity treatment IDT . Co-interventions : During 6 week IDT CTT , intervention ( medication , ally health care etc ) keep stable possible . Any change treatment monitor . Subjects : Patients recruit movement disorder specialist medical center involve . The following clinical descriptive outcome collect : Disease duration , Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage , Unified Parkinson 's Disease rating scale , New Freezing Gait Questionnaire , Cognitive score , Beck 's Depression Index , general gait performance ( 2 minute walk test ) . Test procedure : Testing conduct independent therapist centre . Patients follow period 24 week total . Four test moment foreseen : 1 ) one baseline test study entry second baseline test 6 week control period without intervention ; 2 ) one test 6 week train 3 ) one test 12 week follow-up without training . All spatiotemporal gait outcome without DT measure normal speed condition therefore require transport patient gait laboratory . Clinical testing also conduct environment . Both center use GAITRite Walkway System gait laboratory , consider 'gold standard ' instrumented system measure spatiotemporal gait parameter . The untrained secondary task Auditory Stroop task deliver wireless headphone . A microphone record verbal responses patient , allow detailed measurement reaction time patient ' response . This system currently use one center ( Katholieke universiteit Leuven ) . Secondary task performance measure sit well walk . Tests : 1 . DT gait performance evaluate measure gait speed perform untrained cognitive task , i.e . Auditory Stroop . 2 . Safety assess determine fall rate ascertain weekly telephone call . 3 . We also test cognitive performance train dual task ( Digit Span Backward ) functional task ( use mobile phone ) . At baseline , appropriate level cognitive challenge patient determine . We measure gait secondary task performance separately calculate dual task interference outcome . Other outcome - Single task gait performance : speed , stride length cadence ; - Single task cognitive performance ( sit ) ; - Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale ( measure function ) ; - Tests executive function attention ; - Freezing Gait Questionnaire - ADL scale - PDQ39 Quality LIfe scale</detailed_description>
