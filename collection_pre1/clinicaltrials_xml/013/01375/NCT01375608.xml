	<brief_summary>Background : - In sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , proteins red blood cell carry oxygen behave normally . In part body low level oxygen oxygen use , sickle hemoglobin protein may change shape stick together . This cause red cell clump , reduce blood flow . This lead even low oxygen level cause damage and/or pain . - One way stop red blood cell stick together increase level fetal ( baby good ) hemoglobin . The good hemoglobin take place sickle hemoglobin . - Hydroxyurea approve drug SCD . But hydroxyurea work two-thirds people SCD . Even case sometimes stop working time . - Researchers interested test decitabine . The drug may help increase fetal hemoglobin level . But yet approve treat SCD . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness decitabine increase fetal hemoglobin level improve symptom sickle cell disease . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age sickle cell disease improve least 6 month hydroxyurea therapy . Those take hydroxyurea side effect may also participate . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also blood urine test , lung function test , test require . - Participants receive decitabine injection twice week 1 year . Depending response treatment , dose remain reduced week . - Participants monitor frequent blood test study direct study doctor . - After study complete , participant go back usual sickle cell care . If decitabine improve participant 's SCD , treatment may continue regular health coverage insurance arrange .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview : Elevated fetal hemoglobin ( HbF ) , whether pharmacologically induced congenital , favorable impact morbidity mortality SCD . The agent currently use elevate HbF , hydroxyurea ( HU ) , limited efficacy . There mechanistic reason believe DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine ( decitabine ) potently increase HbF . This demonstrate vivo animal small phase 1/2 study decitabine SCD subject . Decitabine low , non-cytotoxic dos well tolerate efficacious increase HbF total hemoglobin ( Hb ) subject respond , intolerant , HU . In addition HbF level , major improvement note range surrogate clinical endpoint measure red blood cell ( RBC ) adhesion , endothelial damage , coagulation pathway activity . Also , substantial clinical improvement see severely ill patient treat off-label . The primary objective herein provide evidence guidance phase III study demonstrate dose schedule decitabine give 12 month period , produce sustain elevation HbF without significant toxicity . Secondary objective examine patient report outcome measurement ( PROMIS ) , crisis frequency , laboratory index measure different domain sickle cell pathophysiology DNA methylation . These secondary scientific measurement correlate examined time understand mechanism disease mechanism action study drug . Intervention : Decitabine start dose 0.2 mg/kg ( range , 0.05-0.3 mg/kg ) 1-2x/wk x 48 week Hypotheses : In SCD subject risk early death , non-cytotoxic DNMT1 depletion use metronomic ( frequent intermittent ) regimen nucleoside analogue decitabine directly antagonize mechanism gamma-globin repression , produce sustain , clinically significant HbF elevation . Primary Objective : To measure , high-risk SCD subject , effect chronic metronomic subcutaneous ( SQ ) decitabine administration HbF level . These aim achieve conduct extend , open-label , phase 2 study subject remain high risk early mortality morbidity despite HU therapy . Secondary Objectives : To measure , high-risk SCD subject , effect chronic metronomic SQ decitabine administration clinical laboratory index safety , patient report outcome measure ( PROMIS ) , frequency crisis , SCD pathophysiologic activity ( hemolysis , coagulation , platelet activation inflammation ) , molecular effect study drug . Criteria Evaluation : Primary Endpoint : percentage change HbF level baseline average percent final 3 month study period ( 48 week ) . Secondary Endpoints : clinical laboratory assessment safety , patient report outcome ( PROMIS ) , frequency crisis , quantity F cell F cell subset , measurement hemolysis , coagulation , platelet activation , inflammation , endothelial damage , pulmonary arterial pressure , DNMT level , global beta-globin locus specific DNA methylation . Study Design : This extended , single arm , open-label , phase II clinical trial . Study Population : Adults symptomatic SCD high risk early mortality despite great equal 6 month HU therapy . Specifically , still : HbF &lt; 5 percent , OR 3 pain episode per year require parenteral narcotic , OR 1 acute chest syndrome episode , OR hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL absolute reticulocyte count ( ARC ) less equal 250,000/mm ( 3 ) . Subjects meet criterion high risk unwilling unable tolerate HU also eligible . Clinical Laboratory Evaluations : Pre-treatment every 2 week : CBC , chem 20 include LDH , retic count Pre-treatment every 4 week : interim medical history &amp; physical exam , HbF % , pregnancy test Pre-treatment every 12 week : urinanalysis , percent F-cells &amp; percent F-reticulocytes , biomarkers , scientific correlative study DNA methylation Pre-treatment , 24 48 week : PROMIS , PFT , 6 minute walk , endo-PAT Pre-treatment 48 week : erythropoietin level Follow-ups every 3-4 month 52-54 week 93-96 week : interim medical history &amp; physical exam , CBC , reticulocyte count , HbF percent , chem 20 ( include LDH ) , pregnancy test Sample Size : 40 subject Data Analyses : The effect decitabine HbF level time explore use general linear mixed model average percent change baseline average HbF level final 3 month treatment estimate along 95 percent confidence interval . AE safety measurement summarize age group , dose , dose frequency time AE onset . No interim analysis perform study . Human Subjects : There risk neutropenia , thrombocytosis , teratogenicity . Patients must take precaution use contraception avoid pregnancy treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects meet follow criterion eligible enrollment study : 1 . Age 18 year old . 2 . Written , inform consent provide subject study entry . 3 . Confirmed SCD ( SS , Sbeta ( 0 ) thalassemia , SC hemoglobin electrophoresis ) , 4 . Symptomatic SCD 6 month HU OR symptomatic SCD intolerant HU ( unable unwilling tolerate HU due hematological toxicity ) . Symptomatic SCD define one following : HbF &lt; 5 percent , OR 3 pain episode per year require parenteral narcotic , OR 1 acute chest syndrome episode , OR Hemoglobin &lt; 9 degree g/dL ARC le equal 250,000/mm ( 3 ) , 5 . Subject his/her steady state amidst acute complication due SCD . 6 . Willing use 2 form contraception . Some acceptable combination include male partner use condom female partner use oral contraceptive , male partner use condom female partner bilateral oophorectomy , male partner vasectomy female partner use injectable contraceptive ( e.g . Depo Provera ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Since protocol target risk population , tolerability potential benefit approach suggest offlabel treatment seriously ill SCD patient , exclusion criterion overly stringent primarily direct avoid teratogenic risk . Subjects meet follow criterion disqualify enrollment study : 1 . Inability give inform consent . 2 . Experienced severe sepsis septic shock within previous 12 week . 3 . Last HU erythropoietin dose obtain within previous 4 week . Renal replacement dose erythropoietin allow decitabine would expect exert red cell and/or HbF response endogenous erythropoietin production . 4 . Participant chronic transfusion therapy ( e.g. , history TIA stroke ) medically contraindicate discontinue transfusion . 5 . Currently pregnant breastfeeding . 6 . Sexually active female childbearing potential ( female except menopausal [ appropriate age period 12 month ] hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy ) unwilling use least 2 acceptable method contraception determine investigator . The use condom male partner would consider one acceptable method contraception . 7 . Sexually active male whose partner childbearing potential unwilling use least 2 acceptable method contraception determine investigator treatment 8 week last dose decitabine . 8 . Moribund concurrent disease ( e.g. , hepatic , renal , cardiac , metabolic ) severity death within 24 week likely . 9 . Other experimental investigational drug therapy past 28 day . 10 . Inability bring ANC 2 x 10 ( 9 ) cells/L platelet count le 1,000 x 10 ( 9 ) cells/L . For female participant : Not heterosexual sexual contact start 4 week begin take decitabine continue 4 week last dose decitabine OR use TWO method birth control . One birth control method must highly effective , Intrauterine Device ( IUD ) , birth control pill , DepoProvera ( medroxyprogesterone acetate ) injection , tie fallopian tube . The additional effective method birth control use diaphragm condom male partner . Birth control begin screen visit continue 4 week last dose decitabine . These step must take even patient history infertility , unless patient hysterectomy period least 24 month . For male participant : decitabine treatment 8 week last dose drug , condom must use engage sexual contact woman childbearing age , even patient successful vasectomy .</criteria>
