	<brief_title>Allogenic Haematopoietic Cell Transplantation Patients With Refractory `` Triple Negative '' Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer ( BC ) common cancer among woman approximately 45 % breast cancer patient develop metastatic disease generally remain incurable median survival approximately 18 24 month . A subpopulation emerge particularly poor prognosis patient disease receptor negative oestrogen , progestin HER2/neu ( triple receptor negative ) . Since effective therapy available setting patient , investigator propose allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation . Recent advance allogeneic haematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) lead reduce intensity preparative regimens non-myeloablative permit development sustain donor chimerism . As result , regimen relate organ toxicity ( RROT ) , consequently non-relapse mortality reduce . However , incidence acute chronic graft-versus-host disease ( aGVHD cGVHD , respectively ) remain major complication . Pre-clinical data , develop Stanford group , establish nonmyeloablative conditioning total lymphoid irradiation ( TLI ) combine depletive anti-T cell antibody protect GVHD skew peripheral T cell subset favour suppressive regulatory T cell . The current proposal Phase II study evaluate safety activity allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell ( PBPC ) transplantation use TLI/ATG condition regimen , kinetics donor haematopoietic cell engraftment chimerism , incidence severity acute GVHD follow allogeneic transplantation use novel preparative regimen TLI combine antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) . Patients triple negative breast cancer consider transplantation use donor graft HLA-matched related donor . The preparative regimen TLI combine ATG expect result high level sustain donor haematopoietic cell engraftment significantly reduce incidence acute GVHD .</detailed_description>
