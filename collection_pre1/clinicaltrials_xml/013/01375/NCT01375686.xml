	<brief_summary>The study complete 500 subject across 9 clinical site evaluate precision accuracy SCOUT DS ( Diabetes Screening ) subject risk type 2 diabetes . The study involve two unique Scout device clinical site . Each site initially contain CS-1 ( Commercial SCOUT 1 ) `` A '' collection data . As become available , CS-1 `` B '' operating late version SCOUT software ship site . The NSEEDS study enroll patient at-risk type 2 diabetes meet study inclusion criterion ( meet one exclusion criterion ) approximately 9 clinical site distribute across United States . Eligible subject must least 18 year old , exist diagnosis diabetes , less 45 year old , must body mass index ( BMI ) ≥ 25 least one risk factor type 2 diabetes . The data collect partial area receiver operator curve ( pAUC ) compute via method moment 20 % 50 % false positive rate base first valid Scout `` A '' measurement patient . The impaired glucose tolerance status determine average two hour , post challenge plasma glucose sample measure central laboratory . This compare 1000 bootstrap re-samplings calibration data pull cohort match collect study . A test conduct assure SCOUT performance lie within 95 % empirical confidence interval base bootstrap re-sampling .</brief_summary>
