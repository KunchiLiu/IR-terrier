	<brief_summary>Over period year numerous report many develop country include Pakistan show rise treatment failure rate first line drug ( amoxicillin cotrimoxazole ) non-severe pneumonia child . The reason rise treatment failure rate entirely clear one reason think increase antimicrobial resistance H. influenzae Strep . pneumoniae first line drug . There microbiological data suggest resistance overcome increase dose amoxicillin . The investigator propose treat non-severe pneumonia double dose amoxicillin attempt demonstrate decrease treatment failure rate . This multicentre , double blind randomize control trial child 2-59 month age non-severe pneumonia compare clinical outcome standard double dose group . It felt WHO criteria treatment failure child pneumonia stringent never systematically evaluate community . The investigator also propose modify WHO criteria field test trial attempt demonstrate less stringent treatment failure criterion would impact overall treatment failure rate pneumonia . Hypothesis : Therapy outcome double dose oral amoxicillin different standard dose amoxicillin , use three day treatment non-severe pneumonia 2-59 month old child .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Standard Versus Double Dose Amoxicillin WHO Defined Non-severe Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : World Health Organization 's ( WHO ) standard case management strategy reduce ARI related mortality recommend oral cotrimoxazole oral amoxicillin first line drug treatment pneumonia . In 1989 , Pakistan Ministry Health ( MOH ) adopt strategy control ARI mortality recommend cotrimoxazole treatment outpatient pneumonia due low cost . A number study subsequently perform show significant vivo vitro resistance H. influenzae S. pneumoniae , commonest bacteria cause childhood pneumonia , cotrimoxazole . This increase clinical failure oral cotrimoxazole put lot pressure national international forum National ARI Control Programme Pakistan change recommendation cotrimoxazole amoxicillin first line therapy . Besides efficacious non-severe pneumonia amoxicillin show good efficacy child severe pneumonia bacteremic child . although case case basis pneumonia , vitro resistance correlate well vivo failure . One hypothesize bacterial pneumonia certain proportion pneumonia case , rise clinical failure may relate increase antimicrobial resistance S. pneumoniae H. influenzae amoxicillin . It felt WHO criteria treatment failure stringent . Improvement define return respiratory rate cut particular age 48 hour . Some child viral pneumonia continue respiratory rate cut first follow-up . These child otherwise well show sign deterioration disease accord WHO criterion would classify treatment failure . The treatment failure rate hence influence definition use . The exist data show increase dose amoxicillin achieve high MICs eradication causative organism tend much complete . As yet , clinical trial conduct address important question treatment childhood pneumonia . We propose multicentre , randomize , control double blind trial compare standard versus double dose oral amoxicillin three day treatment non-severe pneumonia child less five year age . Primary Objectives : 1 . To compare proportion child 2 - 59 month age present non-severe pneumonia , achieve clinical resolution day 5 standard ( 15 mg/kg/8hrly ) versus double dose ( 30 mg/kg/8hrly ) oral amoxicillin therapy give 3 day . Secondary Objective : To follow clinical course non-severe pneumonia alternative criterion treatment failure ( sign deterioration i.e . low chest indrawing appearance danger sign ) day 3 compare child persistent fast breathing ( respiratory rate cut age ) day 3 . Null Hypothesis : Therapy outcome double dose oral amoxicillin different standard dose amoxicillin , use three day treatment non-severe pneumonia 2-59 month old child . STUDY POPULATION AND SITE : Patients : They recruit come outpatient department ( OPD ) large tertiary care hospital Pakistan . CONSENT : The purpose study explain parent oral informed consent participate obtain . A proposed consent form attach ( Annex . 1 ) . Study Design : This randomize , double blind , multi-centre trial . Definitions : ARI define accord WHO ARI Programme guideline 2 child either cough difficult breathing . A clinical resolution define return respiratory rate normal ( pneumonia ) accord WHO ARI standard case management classification 2 . Clinical Failure define development chest indrawing ; danger sign ; persistence fast breathing day 5 follow-up thereafter lead therapy change . Improved define slow respiratory rate ( either back normal range age , low 5 compare previous evaluation ) , feed well accord mother low body temperature previous assessment . Same define still breathe fast ( respiratory rate Â± 5 breaths/minute compare previous evaluation high ) , chest indrawing danger sign . Worse define development low chest indrawing danger sign . A relapse define development recurrence sign pneumonia till day 14 fast breathing disappear initially . Follow-up : All child followed-up day 3 , 5 14 . Sample size : Keeping mind overall treatment failure rate 20.9 % amoxicillin MASCOT study ( 1999 - 2001 ) , expect proportion patient fail respond standard dose amoxicillin around 21.0 % .7 In order double dose efficacious difference 5 % treatment success rate compare standard dose . We assume failure rate 13 % double dose amoxicillin . By use power 80 % confidence interval 95 % , estimate sample size come 369 group . Assuming loss follow 15 % ( patient study day 14 follow-up ) estimate sample size 425 patient group , total 850 patient . Thus 900 patient enrol one half ARI season . DATA ENTRY AND ANALYSIS : Data form fill auto copy form review site co-ordinator . Data enter use Epi Info 6 enter twice two separate operator data base validate use Epi Info 6 . Outcome measure : A clinical resolution define return respiratory rate normal ( pneumonia ) day 5 , accord WHO ARI standard case management classification . Clinical/treatment Failure define development chest indrawing ; danger sign ; persistence fast breathing day 5 follow-up thereafter lead therapy change . Data analysis : Analysis carry intention treat basis . For primary outcome proportion therapy failures 95 % CI calculate two regimen . Then compare proportion therapy failure use alternative criterion WHO define conventional therapy failure criterion .</detailed_description>
