	<brief_title>Study Comparing Intramedullary Nailing , Plate Fixation , Non-operative Treatment Clavicle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients acute , displace fracture middle third clavicle randomly assign either non-operative treatment group operative treatment group . The operative treatment group randomly assign repair either intramedullary device plate screw . Pre-operative variable account detail . Operative variable include duration surgery , length incision , fluoroscopy time , blood loss , quality reduction record . Patients follow regular post-operative visit radiographs clinical examination perform . Outcome variable include post-operative pain , time union , union/non-union rate , return work , return activity , radiographic outcome , complication rate , incidence repeat procedure , cosmesis , functional outcome base strength , range motion , score system . There five hypothesis study : 1 ) Operative treatment acute displace midshaft clavicle fracture yield good patient-based functional outcome compare nonoperative treatment measure physical assessment strength range motion , standardize score system return normal daily activity . 2 ) Operative treatment acute displace midshaft clavicle fracture yield low radiographically-determined nonunion rate , improve cosmesis few complaint residual pain compare nonoperative treatment . 3 ) Operative treatment acute displace midshaft clavicle fracture intramedullary pin efficacious operative treatment plate fixation measure duration surgery , length incision , fluoroscopy time , blood loss , quality reduction . 4 ) Operative treatment acute displace midshaft clavicle fracture intramedullary pin result few complication operative treatment plate fixation include ; nonunion rate , infection , incidence repeat procedure , refracture rate , hardware malfunction . 5 ) Operative treatment acute displace midshaft clavicle fracture intramedullary pin yield low radiographically-determined nonunion rate , improve cosmesis , few complaint residual pain compare operative treatment plate fixation .</detailed_description>
