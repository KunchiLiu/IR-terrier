	<brief_summary>Uterine Leiomyomata , also know uterine fibroid , non-cancer tumor find wall uterus womb . Uterine fibroid common cause surgery ( removal uterus ) . African American woman 3-4 time likely uterine fibroid . Currently effective long-term medical treatment fibroid . Hormones use short-term therapy , use long-term risk side effect . When woman stop receive hormone therapy often fibroids return . Surgery common treatment woman suffer abnormal symptom cause fibroid . Hysterectomy effective treatment , however woman child removal uterus . Epigallocatechin Gallate ( EGCG ) one main natural chemical find green tea.. Research investigator do laboratory animal lead believe EGCG may decrease growth fibroid . This study intend determine whether EGCG cause fibroid tumor shrink reduce fibroid relate symptom abnormal vaginal bleeding pelvic discomfort .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Green Tea Extract : Non-Surgical Alternative Treatment Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Uterine leiomyoma ( also know fibroid ) benign estrogen-dependent tumor uterine wall . Uterine fibroid common tumor female reproductive tract , occur 20-70 % premenopausal woman reproductive age woman cause multiple clinical complication acute chronic pelvic pain well excessive vaginal bleeding iron deficiency anemia , moreover consider leading indication hysterectomy reproductive age African American ( AA ) woman . The impact serious clinical complication woman 's health tremendous . African American woman particularly affect prevalence uterine fibroid 4 time higher ethnic group compare Caucasians . Being major health disparity issue , uterine fibroid appear diminish quality life AA woman also suffer high incidence chronic disease diabetes , heart disease , obesity , cancer . Currently effective long-term medicinal treatment common disease . GnRH analogue effective short medical therapy option . However , approve long-term ( 3 month ) risk irreversible bone loss osteoporosis major side effect . When medication discontinue , fibroid return original size symptom recur , FDA approve uterine fibroid preoperative adjuvant improve fibroid-related iron-deficiency anemia . Surgery , usually form hysterectomy , traditional treatment woman symptomatic uterine fibroid . Clearly hysterectomy effective treatment precludes future fertility . This create major dilemma woman symptomatic uterine fibroid complete family even start family . Problems fibroid must view public health concern well major health disparity issue . The general public relation problem must concern : ( 1 ) The decrease quality life woman affect , hence well-being whole family ; ( 2 ) Interference inter-family dynamic relationship . Decrease productivity workforce/job performance . Increase cost health care cause 600,000 hysterectomies/Y USA alone . - Green Tea Extract This work evaluate utility EGCG , green tea extract , common nutritional supplement , symptomatic relief common woman 's health problem . Considering wide acceptability nutritional supplement especially among African American woman , ethnic group affect uterine fibroid , project potentially provide effective inexpensive non-surgical alternative management uterine fibroid . Green tea common agent use woman multiple purpose . Epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) major catechin ( 80 % ) green tea . EGCG exhibit several useful biological effect include anti-inflammatory , anti-proliferative well anti-oxidant effect . A study conduct United States Department Agriculture report green tea potent anti-cancer effect wide range human cancer cell . Green tea 's polyphenols , notably EGCG , consider responsible positive effect . Green tea polyphenols also show inhibit key pathway tumor growth . - Prior Human Experience EGCG Several human clinical study use EGCG extend period time EGCG well tolerate virtually reportable side effect . Wolfarm colleague use oral EGCG 300 mg/day cardiac patient report improved endothelial function increase brachial artery flow-mediated dilation parallel change EGCG plasma concentration . report consumption 500-1000 mg/day oral EGCG 3 month result marked decrease several anti-oxidative biomarkers compare placebo . Numerous study describe favorable effect EGCG use overweight obese individual extend duration . Chow et.al . report human use EGCG 30 healthy volunteer randomly assign one follow dos Polyphenon E ( decaffeinate green tea catechin mixture ) : 400 , 800 , 1200 mg/day ( 10 subject per dose group ) . Only transient mild nausea note 3 % study participant see high study agent dose ( 1200 mg EGCG/day ) fast condition . Doses 800mg well tolerate report side effect . Grapes also contain polyphenols catechin EGCG . EGCG powerful catechin account favorable health effect use grape extract . Grapes polyphenols show inhibit key pathway tumor growth . Grapes EGCG appear block stage tumor-genesis modulate signal pathway involve cell proliferation , transformation , inflammation , oxidative stress , clearly involved pathogenesis various tumor include uterine fibroid . Freeze-dried table grape powder use recently several month pre-and post-menopausal woman dose 36 gm/day . This dose correspond 800mg EGCG/day . This treatment well tolerate report side effect . This suggest supplement successfully administer woman part life diet modification program . - Preclinical Data Recent study group demonstrate ability EGCG control proliferation induce apoptosis human leiomyomata cell vitro animal model . Our preclinical data fibroid animal model demonstrate EGCG dose 1.25mg/Kg/day add drinking water able induce highly significant ( 80 % ) shrinkage fibroid lesion compare untreated control . The treatment well tolerate detected side effect . Such daily dos EGCG administer safely human subject prior clinical trial . This effect partially attribute potent inhibitory effect EGCG Catechol-O-methyl transferase ( COMT ) , enzyme recently link pathogenesis uterine fibroid . In proposal aim evaluate efficacy Epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) reduce size uterine fibroid improve quality life woman symptomatic uterine fibroid , well assess safety profile . - We recently demonstrate elevated level expression catechol-O-methyl transferase ( COMT ) uterine fibroid compare adjacent normal myometrium , describe important role fibroid pathogenesis . - Interestingly , recent report demonstrate EGCG potent anti-COMT activity . These report show green tea extract intake associate weight loss due diet-induced thermo-genesis . This effect generally attribute EGCG . This catechin know capable inhibiting COMT , enzyme degrades nor-epinephrine , thus stimulate thermo-genesis . The inhibition COMT EGCG uncompetitive respect S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) suggest direct interaction EGCG SAM-binding site COMT , yet clear inhibition COMT activity increase EGCG concentration . Additionally , Vmax value methylation decrease . Our preliminary data also show EGCG inhibit COMT gene expression dose-dependent manner human leiomyomata cell . - Our hypothesis use `` EGCG '' nutritional supplement decrease size uterine fibroid improve fibroids-related clinical symptom woman result significant improvement quality life . - This work evaluate utility common nutritional supplement symptomatic relief common woman 's health problem . Considering availability , low cost , well wide acceptability nutritional supplement , project potentially provide inexpensive non-surgical alternative management uterine fibroid would major impact health woman ethnic group .</detailed_description>
