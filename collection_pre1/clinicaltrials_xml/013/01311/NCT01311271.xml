	<brief_title>Effects Quantity Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) Recovery After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) modulate excitability brain via non-invasive method . In sense , rTMS use treat variety symptom stroke last two decade . Especially , improvement upper extremity function prove many study . However , remain uncertain optimum amount rTMS . The aim multicentric double blind study ( randomize study ) demonstrate relationship amount rTMS efficacy treatment upper extremity motor deficit stroke patient . Fifty-seven patient include write consent . After randomization , subject receive 3 different amount treatment rTMS-rTMS , Sham-rTMS , Sham-Sham ) double blind method .</detailed_description>
