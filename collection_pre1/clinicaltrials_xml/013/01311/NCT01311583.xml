	<brief_title>Evaluating Teach Back Method Improving Self-Care Behaviours Heart Failure Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Heart Failure ( HF ) common debilitate disease associate frequent hospitalization , decrease quality life , require complex health care regimen . Heart failure management program promote self-care teaching patient recognize sign symptom , respond symptom contact advice . Teaching intervention aim self-care show improve patient outcome , however , optimal method deliver education unknown . Patient education use Teach Back potential increase self-care behaviour HF patient reduce adverse clinical outcome use plain language , focus key point , ask patient verbally recall information discuss , interactive manner . Research show Teach Back effective strategy improve patient comprehension chronic condition HF diabetes . The RNAO Best Practice Guidelines Self-Management Chronic Conditions ( 2010 ) recommend nursing communication technique `` Closing Loop '' also know `` Teach Back '' ass patient understanding information . The level evidence technique level III ( well design , non-experimental descriptive study , comparative study , correlation study , case study ) . This study provide additional evidence randomize experimental design . The objective study evaluate effectiveness Teach Back self-care ( measure European Heart Failure Self-Care Behaviour Scale ) determine Teach Back affect number ER visit re-admissions post discharge . A secondary objective ass Teach Back technique feasible , accept sustainable method discharge teach hospitalize HF patient St. Michael 's . 1 . Research Question : Does discharge teach use Teach Back method train nurse improve self-care behaviour HF patient measure EHFScBS scale compare standard care discharge teach ? Hypothesis : Patients receive teach back discharge teach improve self-care ( achieve low score EHFScBS ) . 2 . Research Question : Are few ER visit hospital admission post discharge patient receive instruction teach back method ? Hypothesis : Patients receive discharge teach Teach Back less ER visit hospital admission 3 month follow hospital discharge . 3 . Research Question : What feasibility acceptability adapt Teach Back standard practice discharge teach heart failure patient in-patient cardiac care unit St. Michael 's ? Hypothesis : Teach Back accept sustainable method discharge teach HF patient in-patient cardiac care unit St. Michael 's evidenced participant ' feedback ( patient questionnaire nurse focus group ) .</detailed_description>
