	<brief_title>Monitoring Minimal Residual Disease Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia High Grade Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following therapy , majority patient AML many patient MDS achieve remission define lack evidence disease view bone marrow sample microscope . Despite absence disease method , many patient remission still refer Minimal Residual Disease sensitive method apply . The presence Minimal Residual Disease follow therapy guarantee patient experience relapse . This likely result failure technique examine cell responsible disease relapse . Recent data suggest majority patient AML MDS minor population malignant cell capable maintain disease likely responsible relapse follow therapy . This minor population cell identify protein surface . This study test ability identify Minimal Residual Disease follow therapy perform special assay specifically target minor population malignant cell .</detailed_description>
