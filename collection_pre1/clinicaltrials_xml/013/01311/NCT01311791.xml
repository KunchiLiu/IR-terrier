	<brief_summary>This pilot study evaluate safety efficacy Algisyl-LVR™ device . The purpose study investigate Algisyl-LVR™ employed method leave ventricular augmentation restoration patient dilate cardiomyopathy . Algisyl-LVR™ injected myocardium direct visualization surgical procedure . This study evaluate concept direct mid leave ventricular ( LV ) intramyocardial injection Alginate hydrogel implant free wall fail LV reduce LV size , restore LV shape , low LV wall stress improve global LV function . The Primary Efficacy Endpoint study change Peak VO2 ( maximum oxygen uptake ) baseline 6 month follow-up . The Primary Safety Endpoint study estimate 30 day mortality associate implantation Algisyl-LVR device The hypothesis study statistically significant difference change Peak VO2 baseline 6 month follow-up medically manage arm compare Algisyl-LVR arm , i.e . Algisyl LVR arm superior medical management .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Controlled Study Evaluate Algisyl-LVR™ Method Left Ventricular Augmentation Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , parallel group evaluation safety effectiveness Algisyl-LVR patient dilate cardiomyopathy either ischemic non-ischemic origin . The evaluation primary efficacy endpoint ( Peak VO2 ) 6 month investigator-blinded . The primary safety endpoint , blind , 30 day all-cause mortality objective assessment . The remain study endpoint evaluate effect device evaluation functional , structural , biochemical , electrocardiographic evaluation 6 12 month . Evaluation adverse event assessment also provide evidence safety profile device patient dilate cardiomyopathy . Pre-enrollment baseline patient evaluation include clinical assessment , assessment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional class , blood test , chest x-ray , echocardiography , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , electrocardiogram , cardiopulmonary exercise testing , submaximal exercise testing , quality life assessment . Blinded central evaluation perform measure cardiopulmonary exercise testing , blood test , Holter Monitors cardiac imaging . After write patient inform consent obtain verification eligibility , patient meet selection criterion randomize . All patient must stable , evidence-based therapy heart failure . Patients assign Investigational Device group Algisyl-LVR™ device ( implant ) administer surgical procedure . For patient randomize investigational device group , investigator make every attempt minimize time randomization surgery ( i.e , 7 10 day ) . Patients consider part study cohort soon randomly allocate either Treatment Control group . This time point also consider start follow-up . For patient allocate Investigational Device group , start point follow-up surgical mortality surgical complication start date surgical procedure perform ( attempt ) . The acute response device implant monitor intraoperatively via continuous electrocardiographic cardiac monitoring , arterial pressure line , transesophageal echocardiography ( TEE ) , pulmonary artery catheter . Patients receive investigational device expect remain hospitalized 5 14 day . Patients assign control group continue standard medical therapy ( without investigational device ) . Follow-up study divide two phase . During first phase , refer `` efficacy phase '' , repeat test patient functional cardiac structural parameter conduct follow-up visit schedule 3 month 6 month , every 6 month thereafter . Follow-up testing supplement 30 day ( post randomization ) telephone contact patient . The efficacy phase trial end common closing date minimum 6 month follow-up ( i.e. , last patient enrol complete 6 month visit ) . At point data analysis perform initial study report generate . Following completion efficacy phase , long-term monitoring continue patient 's 24-month visit . This second phase refer `` extended follow-up phase '' . During phase , data collection focus long-term safety conduct 6-month interval . Patient 's randomized control group complete 12 month visit provide option enrol Clinical Study LSH-11-001 : An Open Label Rollover Trial Patients Randomized Control Group Study LSH-10-001 . Patients must continue meet inclusion exclusion criterion state Study LSH-10-001 eligible Study LSH-11-001 .</detailed_description>
