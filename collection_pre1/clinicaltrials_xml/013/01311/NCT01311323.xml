	<brief_summary>MILESTONE STUDY dedicate problem connect patient multivessel coronary artery disease and/or leave main narrowing present symptom acute ischemia . For kind patient accord current ACC/AHA guideline CABG ( surgical revascularization ) recommend treatment method . In comparison CABG , recent study show PCI ( percutaneous coronary intervention ) associate low rate periprocedural adverse event similar long term event-free survival patient leave main disease . Our late non randomize registry randomize LEMANS study , compare LMCA ( leave main coronary artery ) stenting CABG confirm finding . LEMANS ACS ( acute coronary syndrome ) retrospective registry patient UPLMCA ( unprotected LMCA ) disease non ST elevation ACS show low 30 day trend toward low one year mortality PCI compare CABG . It stress , acute ischemia substantially increase risk CABG . In fact , limited data outcome ULMCA stenting CABG patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Similarly , randomized study compare PCI v CABG multivessel disease include mainly patient stable angina , small cohort patient unstable angina exclude patient non ST elevation Myocardial infarction . In SYNTAX study -largest PCI v CABG trial , randomized patient patient low perioperative risk ( logistic EUROSCORE &lt; 5 ) ACS patient routinely exclude . High perioperative risk patient include PCI registry .</brief_summary>
