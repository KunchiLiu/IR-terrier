	<brief_summary>EV71 cause large epidemic lot fatal case case sequelae . However , clinical syndrome severity EV71 strain diverse , range asymptomatic ( 71 % ) fatal ( 0.05 % ) disease , pathogenesis remain unknown . In addition , severe fatal case incidence varies significantly differently different area Taiwan . Although viral virulence study perform , clear viral virulence factor find . Therefore , host factor may important clinical outcome EV71 infection . In addition , significantly different incidence severe fatal case different area Taiwan , example , significantly fatal severe case occur central southern Taiwan comparison northern Taiwan . Whether related host factor , social , behavioral environmental factor remain unanswered . To find important factor associate EV71 susceptibility , thorough study involve genetics , social , behavioral environmental factor among different area Taiwan warrant finding provide future prevention EV71 give help early precaution treatment EV71 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim find factor associate different severe/fatal incidence different area Taiwan . We 1 . Comparison gene variant EV71 case different severity normal child different area Taiwan find susceptible gene genetic polymorphism relate clinical outcome 2 .
