	<brief_title>Surveillance Follow-up Latent Tuberculosis Infection Risk Developing Active Tuberculosis Patients Receiving Long-term Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) remain important infectious disease worldwide . Taiwan still edemic area . In 2008 , incidence 62 person TB per 100,000 population . To control TB , prevent TB transmission via early diagnosis treatment latent TB . In screen risk population TB , patient renal failure acquire long-term dialysis , addition close contact , high incidence mortality general population . Moreover , risk active TB dialysis patient ten 25 time large . In Taiwan , dialysis group important high prevalence ( 2228 per per million people 2009 annual report United States Renal Data System ) country world . In particular , dialysis patient usually extrapulmonary presentation TB , diagnosis always delay . Hence , detect latent TB dialysis patient monitor active tuberculosis . Currently , interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRAs ) use find latent TB proven useful immunocompromised , BCG vaccination . For dialysis patient , IGRAs test consider well skin tuberculin test . However , previous study rarely observed patient receive peritoneal dialysis . Besides , cross-sectional study use indirect evidence diagnosis lack longitudinal follow-up . We thus conduct study observe prevalence latent TB receive hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis use IGRAs . We also keep one-year follow-up primary outcome active TB occurrence .</detailed_description>
