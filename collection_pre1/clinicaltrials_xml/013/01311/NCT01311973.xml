	<brief_title>Salivary Phosphorus Level Kidney Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study demonstrate salivary phosphate level elevate patient chronic kidney disease direct linear correlation serum phosphorus salivary phosphorus . However , data regard relationship salivary phosphate level stage kidney disease ( estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) lacking ; , study seek examine relationship . There normal circadian rhythm serum phosphorus mid-afternoon peak approximately 3 PM nadir approximately 7-11 AM . Furthermore demonstrate fast serum phosphorus level 8 AM NOT indicative 24 hour mean serum phosphorus . Thus relationship salivary phosphorous serum phosphorus may vary course day . This single-center study saliva , urine , serum collect two time point minimum 105 subject various degree renal function ( dialysis ) . Assignment renal group base upon Visit 2 estimate glomerular filtration rate value . Enrollment group continue random target 15 subject per group achieve . It possible individual group may exceed target enrollment number assignment occur retrospectively . All subject require morning assessment conduct hour 7AM 11AM . Clinical chemistry , serum phosphorus , intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) , plasma fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF-23 ) , serum 1,25 di-hydroxyvitamin D , serum 25-OH vitamin D , spot urine collect . A 24-hour urine sample also collect . Passive stimulate salivary collection occur . The salivary collection must occur fast state nothing eat drink least 90 minute prior collection . Subjects permit leave facility . They instruct consume lunch choice hour 1100AM 1200PM . They instruct eat nothing 1200PM . Subjects return clinic Visit 3 direct study staff . Visit 3 conduct 1PM 4PM . Laboratory assessment , salivary collection , spot urine collect Visit 3 . A dietary recall intake Visit 2 3 also complete .</detailed_description>
