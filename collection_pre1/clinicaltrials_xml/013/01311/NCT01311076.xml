	<brief_title>TAK-329 Glucose Clamp Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1DM ) , also know insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus juvenile-onset diabetes , occur primarily due β-cell destruction , usually lead absolute insulin deficiency . The condition immune-mediated usually idiopathic . Tight glycemic control use intensive insulin therapy show Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) reduce rate microvascular complication T1DM ; however , achieve maintain control T1DM use standard insulin therapy require high level support associate increase potential hypoglycemia , increase weight gain , patient , aggravation cardiovascular risk factor include dyslipidemia . TAK-329 develop Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center , Inc. ( TGRD ) adjunct treatment improve glycemic control patient type 1 diabetes mellitus use insulin therapy . This study take place 1 site United States . A total 36 male female adult participant T1DM take part study . The study last 77 day , include 28 day screen period , 4 cross-over treatment period follow period . Participants confine study clinic 2 day period . Participants also contact phone 30 day follow last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
