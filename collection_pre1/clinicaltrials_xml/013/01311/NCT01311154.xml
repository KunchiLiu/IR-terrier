	<brief_summary>The propose study distinctive study known carrier resistant Enterobacteriaceae . It examine phenotypic genotypic expansion AMR bacterial population function antibiotic treatment , examines effect antibiotic dissemination resistance gene specie specie . It examine CRE , important emerge pathogen , significant threat public health , yet well study . The propose study use interdisciplinary approach , combine PK/PD , phenotypic , genetic data understand effect antibiotic likelihood spread AMR . Most previous study focus effect antibiotic agent clinical detection , infection acquisition AMR among non-carriers67,68 . Other study look effect colonisation-resistance mostly among healthy volunteers69 . Very study examine effect various antibiotic agent carrier ARB focus primarily vancomycin resistant enterococci ( VRE ) 70 . No similar study conduct regard ESBL CRE . Correlation clinical factor environmental contamination determine previously publish study . The propose study also extend analysis effect antibiotic treatment dissemination resistance gene may great importance event may lead emergence new AMR strain specie . The propose study examine effect various antibiotic agent class , also effect duration treatment PK/PD indices amplification ARB . The study also examine effect antibiotic epidemicity fitness colonising strain</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct observational longitudinal prospective study 3 hospital unit high prevalence resistant organism . Consenting patient screen carriage AMR organism admission , find carrier target ARB include longitudinal study . To improve yield screening may use risk stratification base risk factor identify center . Patients include longitudinal study ask provide serial stool sample every 2-3 day hospitalisation ( rectal swab allow replacement stool specimen , develop appropriate methodology correlate stool sample rectal swab ) . These sample analyse use quantitative culture number resistant organism , sample subject quantitative real time PCR quantify resistant gene ( CTX-M , TEM , SHV , KPC , VIM require ) . In parallel , environmental contamination examine quantified use similar method . Data collect daily regard antibiotic treatment , medication , clinical parameter , bowel movement presence diarrhoea , various PK/PD index . The target antibiotic study include commonly use agent hospital set include quinolones , cephalosporin , piperacillin/tazobactam , ertapenem , imipenem , doripenem , metronidazole , clindamycin aminoglycosides . The duration , sequential order treatment PK/PD index examine . The effect surgical antibiotic prophylaxis examine important end point . The effect target antibiotic agents/classes selection , enrichment , spread target AMR organism . Analyses conduct compare : 1. effect various antibiotic 2. effect duration therapy 3. durability effect ( posttreatment ) . 4 . The effect PK/PD index . Secondary analysis examine risk develop infection function various factor include time load carriage resistant organisms exposure antibiotic perform . Correlation clinical isolates perform include typing , gene plasmid analysis determine correlation colonise infect strain . Experiment simulate patient contact conduct examine contamination hand , glove gown contact order correlate environmental contamination contamination healthcare worker . Additional work conduct profile bacterial community DNA fingerprint technique use length hetrogeneity ( LH-PCR ) automate ribososmal internal spacer analysis ( ARISA ) sample patient study .</detailed_description>
