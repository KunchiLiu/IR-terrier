	<brief_title>Study Test Safety Efficacy Cannabidiol Treatment Intervention Opioid Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioid abuse significant global public health problem . Of million opiate-dependent subject today , less quarter individual receive treatment . Pharmacotherapeutic approach traditionally target 5 opioid receptor since heroin metabolite bind high affinity receptor subtype . Although treatment strategy improve substance abuse outcome , effectively block opiate craving thus still associate high rate relapse . Using strategy indirectly regulate neural system modulate opioid-related behavior , preclinical rodent study consistently demonstrate cannabidiol ( CBD ) , nonpsychoactive component cannabis , specifically inhibit cue- induced heroin-seeking behavior . CBD 's selective effect drug-seeking behavior pronounce 24 hr endure even two week last drug administration follow short-term CBD exposure . The fact drug crave generally trigger exposure condition cue suggest CBD might effective treatment heroin craving , specially give protracted impact behavior . CBD already show various clinical study well tolerate wide safety margin human subject . CBD thus represent strong candidate development potential therapeutic agent human opioid crave relapse prevention . It goal exploratory phase project ( 1 ) determine safety basic pharmacokinetic characteristic CBD administer concomitantly opiate human ( 2 ) characterize acute ( 24 hr ) short-term ( 3 day ) effect CBD administration cue-induced crave drug-abstinent heroin-dependent subject use random double blind design . This exploratory investigation together ongoing complementary preclinical rodent study potential significantly impact development novel agent drug relapse prevention critical end continued cycle substance abuse . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE : Despite current available therapy opioid-dependent patient , patient relapse . This research project focus development novel compound , cannabidiol , modulate opioid crave human base animal model show selective effectiveness inhibit drug-seeking behavior . The development target treatment opioid relapse would tremendous medical public health value .</detailed_description>
