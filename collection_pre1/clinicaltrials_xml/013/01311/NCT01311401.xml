	<detailed_description>Research design methods The present study 10 year , nest prospective cohort , population-based survey metabolic syndrome risk factor include type 2 diabetes mellitus . The original cross-sectional survey conduct two small Circassian village north Israel 4000 inhabitant . The baseline evaluation perform 1996 - 1997 . Among 739 randomly select men ( n=289 ) woman ( n=450 4000 individual age 35 year old . Mean age men 53.2±11.8 year woman 52± year . Mean BMI men woman 27.5± 29.4± Kg/m2 , respectively . Plasma glucose level men woman mg/dL ( 22 ) . The investigator recruit cohort propose study individual free diabetes base line include . The number decease change residence decline participate follow-up study report . The protocol approve Ethics Committee Ziv hospital participant give inform consent . Clinical data . Body mass index ( BMI ) , fast blood glucose , blood total cholesterol , triglyceride , low density cholesterol ( LDL ) , high density cholesterol ( HDL ) blood pressure measurements do 10 year ago . In present study , 8 hour caloric fast , blood glucose level test patient ask known recent diabetes mellitus last 10 year treatment dietary , hypoglycemic drug insulin . Laboratory data . In morning , overnight caloric fast , venous blood sample measurement plasma concentration glucose . The blood level glucose do Olympus 640 ZIV hospital . Diagnosis diabetes . At baseline 10-year follow-up , presence diabetes establish accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) criterion ( 84 ) , i.e. , fast glucose ≥126 mg/dl participant clinical diagnosis disease treatment ongoing ( diet , drug ) . The presence disease confirm review medical record general practitioner . No case diabetes accept without validated confirmation .</detailed_description>
