	<brief_summary>The objective propose research ass efficacy eight-week , efficient tolerable , low-intensity resistance-training program concurrent application partial blood flow restriction ( PBFR ) improve quadriceps strength volume woman risk factor incident symptomatic progressive knee OA . This specific aim achieve randomize , control trial , compare low intensity training without PBFR . There numerous report exercise intervention people knee osteoarthritis . However , research novel first use low intensity regimen minimize force knee still potential lead clinically meaningful strength gain old adult risk factor incident symptomatic progressive knee OA .</brief_summary>
