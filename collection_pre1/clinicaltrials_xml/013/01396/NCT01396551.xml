	<brief_title>Evaluating Anchored Transponder Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Calypso anchor lung transponder modify version previously FDA-cleared Calypso soft tissue transponder . This modification include anchor mechanism hold transponder positionally stable within small airway lung . Transponders place locally tumor within lung subsequent radiotherapy Calypso system may use monitor location transponder , extension , tumor , real-time . This allow improve tumor-targeting well gate radiation beam tumor move outside target field respiratory motion . The goal investigation show patient implant anchored transponder localize Calypso System , anchor transponder implantation use feasible safe , anchored transponder positionally stable small airway patient cancer lung .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age â‰¥ 18 year time consent ( 19 year require local state law ) Patients plan undergo radiation therapy primary recurrent carcinoma lung cancer metastatic lung . Patients receive 30 Gy external beam radiation therapy . Patients able tolerate flexible bronchoscopy . Patients life expectancy least 12 month expect able complete full followup assessment protocol . Patients physician able identify suitable implantation site anchor transponder recent ( within past 8 week ) CT scan . This require acquisition CT scan suitable one already available . Patients able comply protocol . Patients implant chest region contain metal conductive material ( e.g. , metal implant , rod , plate ) Sponsor considers interfere Calypso System 's electromagnetic localization ( note Sponsor review patient 's implanted metal case case basis ) . Patients active implanted device , pacemaker , defibrillator , drug infusion pump since effect Calypso System operation device unknown . Patients active infection . Patients bronchiectasis lobe intend implantation site . Patients history hypersensitivity nickel . Patients whose lung tumor monitor MR imaging ( MR image anchored transponder safe yield image artifact around anchored transponder ) . Patients medical condition laboratory value would , discretion investigator , preclude patient participation clinical study . Patients enrol clinical study investigator believe conflict investigation .</criteria>
