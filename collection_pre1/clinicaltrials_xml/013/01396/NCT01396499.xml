	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety , Tolerability Preliminary Efficacy BKM120 , PI3K Kinase Inhibitor , With Advanced Leukemias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : BKM120 design block protein important growth division cancer cell , may cause cell die . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level BKM120 base join study . Up 2 dose level BKM120 test . Up six ( 6 ) participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . You take BKM120 tablet mouth large glass water every day study . You take BKM120 1 hour light breakfast . You take BKM120 time day . You need fast ( eat drink anything except water ) 2 hour take BKM120 dose . You swallow BKM120 tablet whole . The tablet must chew , break , crush . If vomit take BKM120 , take another tablet day make dose . If forget take BKM120 one morning , call doctor ask instruction . Do take BKM120 6pm day take extra dos make miss dose . If study doctor feel need side effect , BKM120 may stop start low dose may stop completely . You ask record pill diary dose take . You return pill diary , unused study drug , pill container clinic staff end cycle . Study Visits : On study , study cycle last 28 day . You study visit every week ( Days 1 15 ) first 2 cycle study , month . The following test procedure perform study visit : - Your medical history record - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test check blood sugar . ° You need fast 8 hour blood draw . - You complete questionnaire mood . On Day 28 Cycle 1 every 3 month , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy check status disease . You may additional bone marrow aspiration collect study doctor think need . Every 4 month , MUGA scan ECHO check status disease . ECGs chest x-ray may perform throughout study check heart lung function doctor think need . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long 12 cycle doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : After stop taking BKM120 , end-of-study visit . The following test procedure perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You ask drug may currently take take . - You complete questionnaire mood . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . The blood also use check kidney liver function check blood sugar . You need fast 8 hour blood draw . - You MUGA scan ECHO check status disease . - You bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy check status disease . This investigational study . BKM120 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 16 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
