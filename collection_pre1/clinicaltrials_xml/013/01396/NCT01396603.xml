	<brief_title>Pilot Study Evaluate Optical Frequency Domain Imaging Diagnosis Central Airway Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence high mortality rate associate lung squamous cell carcinoma lack widely accept screen surveillance tool , highlight need new image paradigm ultimately lead reduction patient mortality . Bronchial carcinoma-in-situ progress invasive cancer 40 % individual , although progression occur long period time , majority carcinoma detect later stage disease development , offer patient slim chance cure . Although significant effort development screen paradigms detection lung cancer central airway make , date still widely accept validated approach . Optical frequency domain imaging ( OFDI ) recent derivative optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . OFDI use conduct volumetric microscopy airway resolution comparable architectural histopathology . The long term goal study use OFDI screen airway hope detect squamous cell carcinoma early curable stage . Standard care bronchoscopy preparation procedure follow include moderate sedation , pulse oximetry blood pressure monitor per department protocol . A combination currently approve bronchoscopy technique include standard white light bronchoscopy , autofluorescence bronchoscopy , narrow band image use ass airway . Bronchial region interest ( ROI ) suspect premalignant malignant , image use OFDI system catheter prior biopsy acquisition . It anticipate minimum 3 OFDI-biopsy correlate pair study participant obtain . An additional OFDI biopsy obtain normal ROI . It expect experimental procedure add less 10 minute total length bronchoscopy procedure , stop rule institute ensure experimental procedure exceed 20 minute .</detailed_description>
