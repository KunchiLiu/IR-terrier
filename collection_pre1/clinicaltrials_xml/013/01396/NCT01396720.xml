	<brief_summary>Clopidogrel platelet inhibitor widely use particularly acute coronary event coronary intervention . Several study show patient resistant clopidogrel . The resistance mechanism entirely clear , least part related interaction medication . Clopidogrel pro-drug convert vivo active metabolite CYP2C19 CYP3A liver . Consequently drug inhibit CYP2C19 affect production active metabolite cause `` clopidogrel resistance '' . Therefore FDA recently publish `` safety alert '' recommend avoid cross treatment clopidogrel drug expect inhibit CYP2C19 ( include omeprazole , fluvoxamine , cimetidine , fluconazole others ) . Nevertheless clear evidence literature clinical relevance interaction . Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) group antidepressant drug widely use treatment depression anxiety . SSRIs consider safe favorable side effect profile , hence many patient coronary event suffers behavioral emotional disturbance treat drug . However several report SSRIs inhibit platelet function increase bleeding tendency particularly concomitant administration aspirin . The propose mechanism block platelet serotonin reuptake result platelet dysfunction . Fluvoxamine - member SSRI family potent inhibitor CYP2C19 . Theoretically fluvoxamine two conflict effect response clopidogrel . Pharmacokinetically expect decrease clopidogrel responsiveness due inhibition CYP2C19 reduction production active metabolite . On hand `` pharmacodynamically '' fluvoxamine may directly inhibit platelet aggregation due effect serotonin reuptake , thus increase effect clopidogrel . Other SSRIs interact CYP2C19 citalophram expect pharmocodynamic effect platelet aggregation . Although clopidogrel SSRIs widely use last decade concomitant treatment quite common , data available influence interaction drug platelet function clinical event . The net effect fluvoxamine SSRIs platelet function presence clopidogrel know . The aim investigator study assess effect two SSRIs fluvoxamine citalophram platelet aggregation test effect drug laboratory response clopidogrel , healthy individual . Study design : randomize , double blind , control crossover trial . Primary study end point : Change % platelet aggregation VASP phosphorylation treatment clopidogrel + fluvoxamine clopidogrel + citalophram compare drug alone .</brief_summary>
