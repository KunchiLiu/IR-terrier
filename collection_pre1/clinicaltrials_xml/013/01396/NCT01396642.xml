	<brief_summary>Almost ( 99 % ) neonatal death occur low middle income country . Most death attributable prematurity infection . With increase rate premature births setting , mortality rate 50 % among preterm baby develop country require inexpensive hospital-based strategy prevent fatal infection newborns country . As deaths preterm neonate attributable vulnerability infection , potential low cost intervention like topical emollient therapy effectively direct reduce infection relate mortality morbidity develop country . Topical emollient therapy reduce rate infection enhance skin barrier function , thus reduce trans-epidermal water loss consequently conserve heat energy promote growth . The broad goal study improve survival rate hospitalize preterm neonate develop country decrease incidence infection use low-cost intervention . HYPOTHESIS : It hypothesize topical emollient therapy coconut oil twice day till 28th day life hospitalize preterm neonate reduces incidence proportion hospital acquire infection 40 % 15 compare routine skin care . For secondary objective hypothesize weight gain neonate receive prophylactic application emollient , coconut oil twice day till 28th day life , least 2g/kg/day18 compare weight gain routine skin care group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research question : 1 . The primary research question address via study whether prophylactic application emollient , coconut oil twice day till 28th day life , effective reduce incidence proportion hospital acquire infection among preterm neonate 40 % compare routine skin care . 2 . The secondary research question whether weight gain neonate receive prophylactic application emollient , coconut oil twice day till 28th day life , least 2g/kg/day compare weight gain routine skin care group . Objectives : This study follow primary objective : 1 . To evaluate effectiveness topical emollient prevent hospital acquire infection preterm neonate . The secondary objective : 2 . To compare weight gain among two group neonate .</detailed_description>
