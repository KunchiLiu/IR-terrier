	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn effect brentuximab vedotin ( SGN-35 ) , investigational medication , patient cutaneous T cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) , specifically mycosis fungoides ( MF ) Sezary syndrome ( SS ) . Despite wide range therapeutic option , treatment associate short response duration , thus condition largely incurable . This investigational drug may offer less toxicity standard treatment well tumor specific targeting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin ( SGN-35 ) Patients With Mycosis Fungoides With Variable CD30 Expression Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 exploratory study evaluate clinical response brentuximab vedotin MF SS , tumor cell express variable level CD30 target molecule . The primary objective explore biologic activity brentuximab vedotin patient MF SS , common type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) , expression CD30 variable . Brentuximab vedotin significant biologic activity Hodgkin 's disease ( HD ) small number CD30 positive tumor cell present , well lymphomas large number CD30-expressing tumor cell systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( sALCL ) . The subject grouping CD30 expression level ( low , intermediate , high ) accrual purpose , ensure wide range CD30 expression study .</detailed_description>
