	<detailed_description>Goals : 1 . Establish feasibility obtain research consent patient collect clinical data , family history , blood sample . 2 . Complete comprehensive genetic analysis diverse group severely obese patient undergone bariatric surgery , specifically primarily non-Caucasian Bellevue population Caucasian population Geisinger Health Systems NYU Langone Weight Management Program , help define genetic factor influence surgical intervention work best patient . The ultimate aim rapidly translate discovery practical solution . Methods Procedures : The participant study patient undergone bariatric surgery Bellevue Hospital , NYU Langone Weight Management Program , Geisinger Health System . The investigator already complete 200 patient plan increase enrollment total 2500 patient . The investigator collect blood sample bariatric surgery patient send blood Geisinger genotyping analysis . An extra sample venous blood ( 4 tablespoon 40ml ) collect time routine postoperative visit . In addition , investigator use information routinely collect postoperative visit part care bariatric patient receive . The investigator look electronic medical record obtain preoperative weight . This include questionnaires patient complete result laboratory test study .</detailed_description>
