	<brief_summary>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) common form support patient admit Intensive Care Units ( ICUs ) industrialize country respiratory distress ( 1 ) . Nasal CPAP ( NCPAP ) effective correct hypoxemia contributes reduce number child require endo-tracheal intubation mechanical ventilation ( 2 ) . CPAP frequently deliver neonate use conventional mechanical ventilator , thus minimal cost saving . There way deliver CPAP , Bubble-CPAP , require source gas flow ( typically 6-8 L/ minute neonate ) , air-oxygen blender , humidifier T-piece. ( 3 ) . The expiratory arm insert bottle water level CPAP deliver equivalent length expiratory tubing remain water . Robust equipment available fraction cost mechanical ventilator . Bubble-CPAP potential advantage mechanical ventilation , low cost , ease application nursing staff , low risk complication , propose inexpensive method deliver CPAP develop country ( 3 ) . High flow air/oxygen mix useful reduce indication mechanical ventilation ( 4 ) ; however , lack randomized study compare bubble CPAP standard flow O2 supplementation nasal prong . High flow air/oxygen mix use flow 2 litre per kg per minute blend air/oxygen mix , usually low fraction inspire oxygen ( say 25-40 % ) . It easy apply , require additional equipment standard oxygen therapy , close monitoring . `` High flow '' delivers uncertain level CPAP , clearly superior bubble-CPAP , control comparative trial two technique . Pneumonia malnutrition two common co-morbidities child develop country ( 5 ) . In hospital resource-poor setting , child severe malnutrition pneumonia often present respiratory distress without severe hypoxaemia impend respiratory failure ( 6 ) . They initially receive O2 supplementation nasal prong face mask . Support bubble CPAP might help effectively treat hypoxaemia , improve respiratory function , avoid need mechanical ventilation complication , reduce mortality . Almost half patient admit intensive care unit Dhaka hospital ICDDR , B present hypoxaemia , many impend respiratory failure . Children pneumonia also invariably severe malnutrition without diarrhoea ( Chisti MJ , MMed thesis , unpublished data ) . They often need mechanical ventilation , attendant cost , complication high mortality rate . However , publish data available use bubble-CPAP child pneumonia malnutrition control trial CPAP develop country . The Hypothesis : In child severe pneumonia hypoxaemia probability treatment failure ( see definition ) significantly low respiratory support initially provide bubble-CPAP high-flow , humidify air/O2 mix nasal prong , compare standard oxygen flow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Compared Nasal Prong Oxygen Humidified High Flow Children Under Five With Severe Pneumonia Hypoxaemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Design Methods 1.1 Study design : This randomise , control study investigator prospectively provide intervention child age 5 year admit Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , B fulfil inclusion criterion ( January 2011 December 2012 ) , subject obtain write informed consent respective parents/care-givers . 1.3 Intervention comparators Children five admit SCU ICDDR , B pneumonia hypoxaemia study . This study evaluate proportion death child five three treatment arm . The investigator use sealed envelope randomly assign child one three treatment arm . In first arm , child receive bubble CPAP ; 2nd arm , child receive standard O2 supplementation nasal cannula 0.5 - 2 l/min ; 3rd arm , child receive humidify high flow air/O2 mix 2 l/kg/min nasal cannula . The three arm compare rate treatment failure ( see ) . During study period , child ( whether ventilation ) three study arm also receive standardize hospital management pneumonia malnutrition . `` Treatment failure '' standardize , base clinical monitoring data . During study period child either study group develop feature `` treatment failure '' ( two three criterion definition ) manage accord best practice clinical context . `` Treatment failure '' criterion follow decide intubation mechanical ventilation . Laboratory investigation : Routine : Blood total differential count white blood cell ( WBC ) , haematocrit , culture sensitivity , serum electrolyte creatinine , stool culture urine culture , chest radiograph ( CXR ) . Protocol-specific : Arterial blood gas analysis , tuberculin skin test ( TST ) , gastric lavage acid fast bacillus ( AFB ) culture MTB . 1.4 Measurements All child monitor pulse oximetry arterial O2 saturation , respiratory rate , low chest wall in-drawing , intercostal retraction , head nodding , cyanosis , tracheal tug , heart failure ( define presence tachypnea , tachycardia , gallop rhythm , hepatomegaly , pedal oedema , basal crackle ) . Arterial capillary blood gas analyse do child fail maintain saturation ( &gt; 90 % allocated treatment ) , concern hypercarbia acidosis . 1.5 Criteria primary outcome The primary outcome , intention treat analysis reach child : A . Has two follow three criterion treatment failure ( least one hour intervention ) 1 . Severe hypoxaemia ( SpO2 &lt; 85 % ) one study arm treatment &gt; 1 hour 2 . Clinical sign exhaustion , include active contraction respiratory muscle paradoxical abdominal thoracic motion , gasping , severe chest wall in-drawing 3 . PCO2 &gt; 80mm Hg pH &lt; 7.2 capillary blood gas OR B . Receives intubation and/or mechanical ventilation OR C. Dies hospital within 30 day discharge OR D. Absconds * still allocate respiratory support . - If abscond day due discharge oxygen well , 's mother 's choice go home early , child put category equivalent treatment failure . 2 Sample Size Calculation Outcome ( Primary Secondary ) Variable ( ) Background , recent data ( 1st January 31st October , 2010 ) ICU Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , B reveal approximate treatment failure management hypoxaemia child pneumonia severe malnutrition 30 % . The investigator assume new intervention would result reduction treatment failure 30 % 18 % ( i.e . 40 % absolute reduction ) . Thus detect difference 40 % death hypoxaemia 90 % power type 1 error 0.03 ( investigator intend mid-term analysis investigator consider type 1 error 0.03 instead 0.05 ) , sample would 295 child group { sample size = [ ( p1×q1 + p2q2 ) / ( p2-p1 ) 2 ] ×factor α , β ; p1 percentage `` treatment failure '' , q1 1- p1 , p2 percentage expect `` treatment failure '' intervention ; q2 1- p2 , α type 1 error β type 2 error factor α , β 90 % power 11.9 } . Considering 10 % drop admission hospital , total sample size least 325 group . So , total sample size 325×3=975 . The patient enrolled period two year .</detailed_description>
