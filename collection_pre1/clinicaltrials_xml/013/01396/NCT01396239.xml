Be age 7 13 year , inclusive . Have stable cardiac function stable pulmonary function ( forced vital capacity [ FVC ] ≥50 % predict require supplemental oxygen ) , Investigator 's opinion , unlikely decompensate duration study . Be receive treatment oral corticosteroid stable dose least 24 week study entry . Subjects may allow take ( nonRNA antisense gene therapy ) medication ( include angiotensinconverting enzyme [ ACE ] inhibitor , β blocker , losartan potassium , coenzyme Q ) long stable dose medication 24 week screen visit ( Visit 1 ) dose remain constant throughout study . Have intact right leave biceps muscle alternative upper arm muscle group . Achieve average distance within 200m 400m ±10 % ( i.e . within 180m 440m ) walk independently six minute . Have leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; 40 % base ECHO obtain screen visit ( Visit 1 ) . A subject abnormal ECHO finding LVEF &gt; 40 % may enrol study Investigator 's discretion ; however , subject must receive stable dos ACE inhibitor β blocker least 24 week study entry . Have parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) able understand comply study procedure requirement . Be willing provide inform assent parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) willing provide write informed consent subject participate study . A subject meet follow criterion exclude study . Use pharmacologic treatment , corticosteroid , might effect muscle strength function within 12 week study entry ( e.g. , growth hormone , anabolic steroid ) . Previous treatment experimental agent eteplirsen , BMN195 , PRO051 . Previous treatment experimental agent participation DMD interventional clinical study within 12 week entry study ; include use shock training system `` STS , '' plan use study . Surgery within 3 month study entry plan surgery time study . Presence clinically significant illness time study entry , include significant renal dysfunction ( measure urinary cystatin C , KIM1 , urinary total protein ) , average heart rate screen Holter monitoring excess 110 bpm ( unless subsequently treat confirm control stable βblocker ) QTc &gt; 450 ms. Use aminoglycoside antibiotic within 12 week screen visit ( Visit 1 ) need use aminoglycoside antibiotic study ( unless discuss agreed Principal Investigator medical monitor ) . Prior ongoing medical condition , Investigator 's opinion , could adversely affect safety subject make unlikely course treatment followup would complete could impair assessment study result .</criteria>
