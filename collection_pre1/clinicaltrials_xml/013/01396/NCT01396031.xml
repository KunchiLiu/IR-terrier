	<brief_summary>Blood marrow transplantation ( BMT ) commonly use treatment oncologic hematologic disorder . Patients undergoing Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) screen functional status among criterion ensure able endure rigorous treatment involve Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . The patient enter transplant process possibly already functionally compromised disease , prior cancer treatment , possible co-morbidities . Additional factor transplantation compromise independent functional status patient include high dose preparative regimen , pancytopenia , steroid-related side effect , hospitalization , transplantation complication infection , pulmonary alteration , acute chronic Graft-versus-host Disease ( GVHD ) , pain , decrease nutritional input , sequelae transplantation . Physical Therapy utilized population primarily supportive therapy prevent limit patient 's functional decline . Studies address general aerobic exercise population paucity research investigate benefit strength-training program , particularly perform weight-bearing , attenuate detrimental effect transplantation functional status . This feasibility study question exercise program include weight-bearing strengthening exercise cardiovascular exercise practical patient carry inpatient . The study also preliminarily determine exercise program influence functional outcome level fatigue . Such outcome measure include 1 ) FiveTimes Sit-To-Stand Test , 2 ) Six-Minute Walk Test , 3 ) stair performance , 4 ) Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Bone Marrow Transplantation ( FACT-BMT ) Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue ( FACIT-Fatigue ) Scales . The study population include patient lymphomas acute leukemia undergo matched-related donor allogeneic myeloablative Blood marrow transplantation ( BMT ) .</brief_summary>
