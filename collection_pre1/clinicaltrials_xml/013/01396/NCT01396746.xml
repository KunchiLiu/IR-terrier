	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore relationship cardiovascular function person post stroke condition performance three field test . This validation study , aim determine two activity VO2 measurement well express functional restriction cause stroke , And find whether Total Heart Beat Index use case stroke survivor prediction mechanical efficiency measure stair-climbing energy cost treadmill walk . The hypothesis Stair Climbing ( STC ) suitable form exercise capacity test compare Treadmill Walk ( TMW ) since potentially require great amount external work , therefore show strong correlation functional test demonstrate ability , whereas TMW utilize movement capability participant full . Another hypothesis cardiac response exertion use predictor measure exertion post stroke population .</brief_summary>
