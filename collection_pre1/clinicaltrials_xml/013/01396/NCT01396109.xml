	<brief_title>GYNECARE PROSIMA* Procedure Versus Modified Total Pelvic Floor Reconstructive Surgery Uterine Prolapse Stage III</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pelvic organ prolapse common problem . The high rate failure lead increase use synthetic graft augment vaginal repair procedure obtain durable result . In 2005 , investigator begin perform modify pelvic floor reconstruction surgery mesh . The nation-wide multicenter prospective clinical trial data show safe , efficient cost-effective . No severe intraoperative complication record recurrence rate 1 year follow-up 8.1 % . Quality life improve significantly baseline , sexual function change . The GYNECARE PROSIMA* system new technique . It provide simplify unanchored mesh repair , avoid need dissection outside pelvic cavity avoids passage suture instrument obturator foramen sacrospinous ligament , thus make surgery much simpler perform reduces risk specific complication occur suture placement tunnel . 1-year anatomic functional outcome international multicenter prospective study POP-Q Stage I I-III pelvic organ prolapse show objective success rate 76.9 % , pelvic symptom , quality life , sexual function improve significantly baseline . In clinical practice , many woman symptomatic POP-Q Stage III uterine prolapse , require surgical correction . They relatively young , therefore care long-term outcome quality life procedure . The purpose multicenter , prospective , comparative study evaluate effectiveness safety two procedure concomitantly perform vaginal hysterectomy ( TVH ) treatment symptomatic POP-Q Stage III uterine prolapse China .</detailed_description>
