	<brief_title>Environmental Genetic Risk Factors Pediatric Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall goal project determine whether well-established environmental genetic risk factor adult onset MS play important role susceptibility pediatric-onset MS. Our study design base hypothesis genetic influence , specifically variation HLA-DRB1 confirm non-MHC MS locus , well environmental exposure include EBV infection tobacco smoke , contribute disease risk . In addition , also examine relationship serum level 25 ( OH ) vitamin D3 prior vitamin D status , risk pediatric onset MS . Finally , investigate whether specific G x E , multivariable relationship influence risk exist pediatric-onset MS . There 16 collaborating site UCSF enroll case control study .</detailed_description>
