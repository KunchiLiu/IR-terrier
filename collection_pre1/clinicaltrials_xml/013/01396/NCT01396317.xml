	<brief_title>Study Tocilizumab Treat Polymyalgia Rheumatica</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This fifteen-month open label , Phase IIa clinical trial conduct assess tolerability , safety efficacy medication call Tocilizumab ( Actemra® ) patient polymyalgia rheumatica ( PMR ) . The typical symptom PMR muscle pain stiffness shoulder , neck hip region . Steroids traditionally use treat condition great success , although long course steroid , 2 year many case , often require . This result many unwanted side effect include diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease , cataract , weak bone fracture , weak muscle , skin bruising , difficulty sleep mood disturbance . In trial , steroid dosage decrease much quickly do routine clinical practice ; expectation steroid therapy withdrawn within six month . Tocilizumab medication already market FDA approve US Japan treatment rheumatoid arthritis , Japan also approve certain type juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( like rheumatoid arthritis child ) Castleman 's disease ( rare disease cause enlarge lymph node ) . It FDA approve treat polymyalgia rheumatica time . In study , give intravenous infusion month treatment period one year . Experiments do blood patient PMR show one particular cytokine small molecule circulates throughout body , interleukin-6 , elevated disease . Tocilizumab medication design specifically block cytokine . The co-primary endpoint study include efficacy , well evaluation safety tolerability . - Efficacy defined proportion patient Disease Remission ( DR ) corticosteroid , without relapse recurrence , six month trial entry - Safety tolerability Tocilizumab evaluate fifteen-month study period monitor adverse event immunogenicity surveillance Disease Remission ( DR ) define disappearance sign symptom polymyalgia rheumatica ( ache stiffness shoulder , hip girdle , ) normalization erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR &lt; 30 mm/hr ) c-reactive protein ( CRP ≤1.0 mg/dl ) , unless elevation ESR and/or CRP attributable cause PMR ( i.e. , infection ) .</detailed_description>
