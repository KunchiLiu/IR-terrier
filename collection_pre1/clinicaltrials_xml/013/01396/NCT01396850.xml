	<brief_summary>BBB dysfunction indicate group schizophrenia patient measure increased albumin immunoglobulin ( IgG ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) level . Most author describe raise protein level 5-20 % schizophrenic patient ( Muller &amp; Ackenheil , 1995 ) . Increased S100B level demonstrate serum patient suffer schizophrenia well depression , may reflect increase BBB permeability . Furthermore , increase remain patient develop residual state relevant negative symptom , whereas S100B level normalize recover patient ( Shalev , Serlin &amp; Friedman , 2009 ) . CSF albumin CSF IgG value correlate significantly SANS ( Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ) subscales SANS total score , show correlation BBB permeability behavioral change . It important say although negative symptom often sign chronicity disease , abnormal CSF finding Muller 's experiment ( 1995 ) relate duration disease , patient quite young duration disease less 3 year . The investigator hypothesize primary vascular pathology , lead BBB breakdown , result leakage serum-derived vascular component brain tissue may cause brain dysfunction disturb thinking process , mood behavior , see psychiatric patient .</brief_summary>
