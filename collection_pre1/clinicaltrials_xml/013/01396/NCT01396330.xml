	<brief_summary>Introduction Stress part investigator daily life , mean cope allow adaptation survival . To end , physiological pathway activate , include neuroendocrine , cardiovascular metabolic response . In short term , majority consequence beneficial , long run , however , chronic psychosocial stress may constitute increase risk coronary heart disease , type 2 diabetes , disability . Acute mental stress induces exaggerate release stress hormone e.g . catecholamine cortisol think increase heart rate ( HR ) blood pressure ( BP ) also increase blood glucose level . In clinical practice , patient health care provider often confront question concern psychological stress possible reason glucose fluctuation . Whether stress poor treatment adherence responsible alter glucose control remain often controversial . Differences inter- intraindividual response stress suggest , small study address effect acute psychological stress glucose control patient diabetes . Patients type 2 diabetes may overestimate effect acute psychological stress glucose control study clearly need definitely exclude confirm relevant effect stress glucose control diabetic patient . For example , effect longer last repetitive event psychological stress glucose concentration still remain elusive . The aim present study therefore investigate effect prolong psychological stress mean repetitive safe drive training course glucose control patient diabetes . Patients Methods Forty patient type 1 insulin-treated type 2 diabetes attend outpatient-clinic Kantonsspital Frauenfeld University Hospital Zurich regular visit invite participate . Included patient oral glucose-lowering treatment least one daily injection insulin , valid driver license write informed consent give . Exclusion criterion diabetes duration &lt; 2 year , pregnancy , unstable coronary artery disease , limited visual acuity unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy , uncontrolled hypertension ( BP &gt; 160/95mmHg ) pituitary adrenal disease . The Ethics committee Kanton Thurgau approve protocol study conform principle outline Declaration Helsinki . Study protocol Each patient complete control stress test day take place consecutively randomize order . Randomization perform uninvolved third person . The study carry drive train area Touring Club Switzerland Hinwil . Patients advise lunch 12:00 a.m. abstain food thenceforth . Drinking mineral water remain allow entire study day , patient take basal insulin medication usual . Patients advise arrive drive train area 2:30 3:00 p.m. At arrival , capillary glucose measurement carry , glucose concentration ≥10mmol/l correct short-acting insulin analogue ( glucose target 6 - 8mmol/l ) . Subsequently , additional adjustment insulin allow study . Glucose concentration ≤4mmol/l always correct administration 10g carbohydrate ( DextroEnergy® orange juice ) . On study day , patient ingest standard meal 4:45 p.m. ( i.e . 15min drive training ) . Immediately meal , short-acting insulin inject knowledge carbohydrate content ( dose day ) oral antidiabetic ingest usual . Measurements capillary plasma glucose concentration , blood pressure , heart rate , stress perception salivary cortisol concentration carry regular interval 4 9 p.m. study day . On control day , patient place quiet room permit read . They also possibility leave room stay balcony . On stress test day , patient complete drive training car 5 7 p.m . The drive training consist 3 consecutive exercise : first , slalom track dry wet asphalt , secondly , full braking exercise water obstacle . Thirdly , car hurl around mechanical plate patient regain control .</brief_summary>
