	<brief_title>A Multi-Center , Prospective , Open Label Safety Trial RedDress Wound Care System ( RD1 ) Management Texas 1a 2a Neuropathic Diabetic Foot Ulcers .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational product , RD1 kit , design enable care provider create vitro blood clot patient 's blood point care , safe effective manner . While many advanced modality treatment develop heal chronic DFUs ( well type chronic wound ) , vast majority approve relatively non-severe wound ( e.g. , Texas 1a/2a grade ) relatively healthy subject control clinical trial typically exclude 25-75 % subject several comorbidities severe wound . Moreover , result trial ( trial advance modality ) subject systematic review , strength evidence efficacy rat low even insufficient judge . Consequently , urgent need new technology test improve heal rate class chronic DFUs . The study multi-center , prospective , single group safety study , consist 20 subject complete study ( note : patient lose follow-up withdrawn , enrollment increase compensate loss subject ) . The subject receive 12 weekly RD1 application . Subject data keep site 's record .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subject ≥18 year age type 1 2 diabetes Texas grade 1a 2a wound locate distal malleolus ( exclude ulcer toe include heel ) depth ≤ 5 mm expose capsule , tendon bone tunneling , undermine sinus tract Prior inclusion ulcer study , wound review eligibility independent assessor use central online review process include image ulcer . For patient potentially multiple eligible DFUs , big ulcer chosen study ulcer . Ulcer size 1 cm2 12 cm2 ( postdebridement ) . Ulcer duration ≥ 30 day . Time 0 ulcer duration ≥ 30 day define first day screening ( i.e. , day 14 ) . Subjects need meet inclusion criterion , include lack ulcer heal day 0 . Study ulcer separate ulcer least 2 cm . Ulcer affect limb free clinical sign infection . ( Subjects wound infection screen visit may treat rescreened participation study eradication infection ) . Postdebridement , ulcer free necrotic tissue . Subject adequate vascular perfusion affect limb , define least one following : ( ) AnkleBrachial Index ( ABI ) ≥ 0.65 ≤ 1.2 ; ( b ) toe pressure ( plethysmography ) &gt; 50 mm Hg ; ( c ) TcPO2 &gt; 40 mm Hg ; ( ) skin perfusion pressure ( SPP ) &gt; 30 mm Hg . HbA1c ≤ 12.0 % ( diabetic patient ) Demonstrated adequate offload regimen . Subject must willing comply protocol include blood drawn create RD1 . Female subject capable conceive male capable insemination must use acceptable form contraception order participate study ( acceptable form contraception include condom male contraceptive pill IUDs woman ) . Ulcer neuropathic diabetic foot pathophysiology ( e.g. , venous , vasculitic , radiation , rheumatoid , collagen vascular disease , arterial etiology , pressure ulcers. ) . Presence underlying osteomyelitis . Patient proven sepsis establish blood culture past 2 week , confirm active infection likely interfere trial , urine tract infection . History alcohol substance abuse , within previous 2 month Subject participate another clinical trial involve device systemically administer investigational study drug treatment within 30 day randomization visit . Subject currently receive ( i.e. , within past 30 day ) schedule receive medication treatment , opinion Investigator , know interfere , affect rate quality , wound heal ( e.g. , systemic steroid , immunosuppressive therapy , autoimmune disease therapy , cytostatic therapy within past 12 month , dialysis , radiation therapy foot , vascular surgery , angioplasty thrombolysis ) . Subject treat wound dressing include growth factor , engineer tissue skin substitute ( e.g. , Regranex® , Dermagraft® , Apligraf® , GraftJacket® , OASIS® , Primatrix® , Matristem® , etc . ) within 30 day randomization schedule receive study . Subject treat hyperbaric oxygen within 5 day screen schedule receive study . Wound patient life expectancy le 12 month . Subjects cognitively impair healthcare proxy cognitively impair clearly understand content inform consent form . Can withdraw blood require amount ( 10 mL per week ) technically . Known coagulation problem , abnormal thrombocyte level heparin give intravenously . Patients take coumadin , aspirin , Plavix ( clopidogrel ) exclude . Hemoglobin anemia ( &lt; 10 g/dL ) . Subject history follow intercurrent illness condition would compromise safety subject , normal wound heal process : End stage renal disease Immunosuppression . Severe malnutrition Liver disease Scleroderma Acquired immune deficiency disease ( AIDS ) HIV positive Connective tissue disorder Exacerbation sickle cell anemia If ulcer area decrease ≥ 30 % initial 2week screening ( ± 2 day ) standard care phase , ulcer area increase ≥ 30 % , subject exclude .
