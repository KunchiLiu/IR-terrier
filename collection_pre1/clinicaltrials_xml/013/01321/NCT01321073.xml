	<brief_title>DelIVery Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) severe , chronic syndrome affect small pulmonary artery ( blood vessel carry blood heart lung pick oxygen ) . At time initiation study , cure exist disease . Medtronic develop fully implantable , long term , intravenous infusion system , potential enhance patient convenience ease use , reduce opportunity catheter-related infection complication issue associate currently use external delivery system . The information gain study could provide evidence support use implantable infusion system management disease state require chronic intravenous therapy . Additionally , information collect study may contribute design new product ( ) /therapy ( y ) and/or instruction use . The purpose clinical study evaluate safety profile Model 10642 Implantable Intravascular Catheter portion PAH Implantable Vasodilator Therapy ( PIVoT ) system . This study focus safety delivery Remodulin Injection treatment patient PAH meet approve Remodulin Injection indication , use approve formulation , approve intravenous route administration . The Model 10642 Implantable Intravascular Catheter use study investigational , mean approve FDA safe . The Model 10642 Catheter different commercially available drug delivery catheter Model 10642 Catheter tube one-way valve design allow medication flow keep blood flow back catheter tube . The Model 10642 Catheter reinforce prevent kinking crushing , could interrupt flow medication . Remodulin Injection Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve drug intravenous subcutaneous treatment PAH . The SynchroMed II Implantable Infusion System approve FDA deliver specific drug patient chronic pain , need management severe spasticity , cancer treatment approve deliver Remodulin Injection patient PAH . There also Catheter Imaging Sub-Study do measure shape change Model 10642 Implantable Intravascular Catheter give set patient position use x-ray imaging . This data help u develop clinically realistic bench test simulation better mimic challenge experience implanted catheter . This Catheter Imaging Sub-Study conduct seven center enroll forty patient currently enrol DelIVery PAH clinical study least three month post-implant current catheter pump .</detailed_description>
