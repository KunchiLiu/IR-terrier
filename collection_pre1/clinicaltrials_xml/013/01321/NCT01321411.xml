	<brief_summary>Respiratory muscle ( muscle use breathe ) need blood ( oxygen ) workload increase . It difficult measure respiratory muscle blood flow ( RMBF ) without invasive technique . We evaluate new , much less invasive technique measure RMBF 2 group : Healthy Volunteers Critically Ill patient breathe machine . The purpose study determine accuracy new monitoring technique call Near Infrared Spectroscopy Utilizing Indocyanine Green Dye compare traditional measurement . The information gain study help u provide good care patient severe lung problem .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PURPOSE To demonstrate relationship Respiratory Muscle Blood Flow Work Breathing use Near Infrared Spectroscopy utilize Indocyanine Green Dye NIRS-ICG . HYPOTHESIS AND OBJECTIVES HYPOTHESIS # 1 : In subject normal respiratory muscle function ( healthy volunteer ) RMBF measure NIRS-ICG technique vary directly work breathing ( WOB ) measure change transpulmonary pressure gradient measure Esophageal Surface EMG . Objective # 1 : To measure demonstrate relationship RMBF WOB/EMG healthy volunteer simulate abnormal pulmonary resistance . Objective # 2 : To measure demonstrate relationship RMBF WOB healthy volunteer simulate abnormal pulmonary compliance . HYPOTHESIS # 2 : In subject abnormal respiratory muscle function ( wean mechanical ventilation exacerbation COPD ARDS ) RMBF measure NIRS-ICG technique vary work breathing measure change transpulmonary pressure gradient measure Esophageal Surface EMG . Objective # 3 : To measure demonstrate relationship RMBF WOB clinical subject abnormal pulmonary resistance ( wean mechanical ventilation COPD exacerbation ) . Objective # 4 : To measure demonstrate relationship RMBF WOB clinical subject abnormal pulmonary compliance ( wean mechanical ventilation ARDS ) . HYPOTHESIS # 3 : We speculate , base previous author , blood flow rate respiratory muscle give WOB different clinical population healthy volunteer . We hypothesize slope linear regression analysis relate BFI WOB ( transpulmonary pressure gradient EMG ) `` steeper '' clinical population , suggest one reason respiratory failure wean difficulty population may inefficient respiratory muscle oxygen utilization . Objective # 5 : To demonstrate RMBF-WOB relationship clinical population different measure healthy volunteer . JUSTIFICATION To date , measurement regional blood flow oxygen utilization proven difficult . Nowhere true measurement regional blood flow oxygen utilization respiratory muscle . Much know Respiratory Muscle Blood Flow ( RMBF ) stem animal investigation human research require highly invasive method . The development minimally invasive technique measurement RMBF potential add significantly knowledge respiratory energetics research clinical setting . Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) use measure absorption electromagnetic energy near infrared range ( 650 1000 nm ) vivo chromophore . When assess regional tissue oxygenation , NIRS assess amount emit energy absorb range associate hemoglobin ( 760 nm ) deoxyhemoglobin ( 800 nm ) . The ratio amount absorb light use generate index tissue oxygenation/deoxygenation . Indocyanine green dye synthetic chromophore absorbs energy infrared spectrum ( 805 nm ) . Guenette et al . measure accumulation ICG respiratory muscle use NIRS concentration ICG arterial blood measure use photodensitometry . This technique advantage able quantify absolute muscle blood flow simultaneous measure cardiac output , thereby allow calculation absolute regional blood flow absolute rate regional oxygen uptake . The practicality technique healthy volunteer complicate need blood withdrawal re-infusions well arterial cannulation measurement cardiac output . To avoid logistical difficulty arterial cannulation central venous cannulation ( require determination cardiac output ) , relative Blood Flow Index ( BFI ) propose . The BFI method minimally invasive alternative first develop rapid repeat bedside estimation cerebral blood flow . The BFI derive transcutaneously measure NIRS ICG signal require arterial cannulation measurement cardiac output . BFI relative measure blood flow absolute flow determine unless arterial ICG concentration measure . Previous analysis compare BFI absolute muscle blood flow determine use NIRS ICG demonstrate strong agreement BFI NIRS derive absolute muscle blood flow . To date , study look relationship NIRS-ICG derive BFI value respiratory workload measure esophageal surface EMG ( EEMG-SEMG ) subject abnormal compliance resistance clinical population . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( chronic bronchitis emphysema ) , pathologic condition characterize lung parenchyma destruction abnormal airway narrow lead limitation air . In clinical practice , COPD define characteristically low airflow abnormal pulmonary system resistance lung function test . In contrast asthma , limitation poorly reversible progress time . COPD 4th lead cause death amongst Canadians . Severe exacerbation COPD may require mechanical ventilation intensive care unit admission . Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) severe lung disease cause direct indirect inflammatory injury . It characterize inflammation lung parenchyma lead impair gas exchange abnormal respiratory system compliance . Hypoxemia release systemically active cytokine frequently result multiple organ failure death . ARDS typically require mechanical ventilation admission intensive care unit . Patients COPD ARDS require mechanical ventilation high risk death either disease complication critical illness . Those survive acute phase illness often require prolonged mechanical ventilation often difficulty wean ventilator support . While lung parenchymal abnormality deconditioning significant component `` weaning failure '' , respiratory muscle strength , potentially respiratory muscle blood flow , may play role . RESEARCH METHOD We conduct series four study demonstrate effectiveness Near Infrared Spectroscopy Indocyanine Green Dye ( NIRS-ICG ) technique non-invasive measurement Respiratory Muscle Blood Flow ( RMBF ) . The first two study occur healthy volunteer second two study occur clinical population ( mechanically ventilate patient recover exacerbation COPD recover ARDS ) . The first two study occur respiratory physiology laboratory ( Health Integrative Physiology Laboratory University British Columbia ) second two occur Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) VGH .</detailed_description>
