	<brief_title>A Study Determine Aquamin Modulates Inflammatory Biomarkers Blood Osteoarthritis Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aquamin seaweed-derived mineral source , rich calcium , magnesium 74 trace mineral include zinc , iron selenium . It produce red algae , Lithothamnion Calcareum , find three location world , include south-west coast Ireland Iceland . During five-year life span , algae absorb essential mineral sea - give Aquamin unique multimineral content . The algae break naturally settle sea bed . These calcified skeletal remain harvest , wash , dry mill provided capsule formulation . AquaCal capsule form Aquamin . AquaPT contain green tea pine bark extract . Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common kind arthritis . OA call degenerative arthritis , disease result breakdown cartilage joint , lead joint pain damage . OA variable lot different type affect different joint . This degenerative disease primarily affect large , weight bearing joint ( include knee , low back , hip , neck foot ) joint hand . In OA , disease begin degeneration cushion cartilage joint . As degrades , synovium end bone thicken , result pain stiffness associate arthritis . The progressive cartilage deterioration follow `` harden joint '' due calcification bone spur formation . Treatment generally involve combination exercise , lifestyle modification analgesic . If pain becomes debilitate joint replacement surgery may use improve quality life . Symptoms Osteoarthritis include early morning joint stiffness pain , loss restriction joint mobility , pain bad use , stiffness period rest , creaking/cracking joint movement ( also know crepitus ) , tenderness swell certain area , restrict mobility , pain joint change weather deformity joint . Osteoarthritis lead cause chronic disability United States . [ 1 ] It affect 8 million people United Kingdom nearly 27 million people United States , age 45 . A number study show great prevalence disease sibling especially identical twin , indicate hereditary basis [ 2 ] . Up 60 % OA case think result genetic factor . Other factor cause OA congenital disorder joint , diabetes , inflammatory disease chronic form arthritis . In addition , injury joint result accident , septic arthritis , Marfan syndrome , obesity , ligamentous deterioration instability may also factor . Current anti-inflammatory treatment OA provide relief symptom suboptimal side effect associated treatment ; particular COX-2 specific NSAID 's become increasingly recognize [ 3,4 ] . As result , use alternative treatment complementary medicine gain popularity among OA sufferer . In previous study , osteoarthritis subject treat Aquamin , significant improvement WOMAC score pain , stiffness , activity composite score course 12-week treatment , comparison subject Placebo group [ 5 ] . Aquamin compose multiple mineral 'active ingredient ' complex difficult determine . A number mineral Aquamin may anti-inflammatory anti-oxidant property might directly and/or indirectly influence efficacy unique complex [ 7,8,9 ] . While prominent mineral present Aquamin calcium ( dosage = 80 % Ca U.S RDA ) , role joint health unclear . Magnesium however , give daily dosage provide 14 % ( male ) 18 % ( female ) U.S. RDA [ 6 ] course study , increase consumption magnesium may influence OA symptom affect utilization calcium potentially reduce inflammation around affect joint . Both manganese selenium give daily dosage provide 16 % 4 % RDA respectfully . Both trace mineral report reduce appearance osteoarthritic lesion reduce severity symptom OA [ 8,9 ] .</detailed_description>
