	<detailed_description>ICUAP increasingly recognise clinical problem associate significant morbidity mortality . However pathogenesis diseae poorly understood yet treatment exists . We believe myostatin FHL-1 important development disease . This base recent research proteins likely regulated sepsis immobility ( two major risk factor ICUAP . There evidence invitro work two likely interact . We design interventional trial investigate hypothesis . Patients admit ICU risk develop muscle wasting select receive electrical muscle stimulation quadriceps muscle 1 week . Physiological measurement peripheral respiratory muscle strength quadriceps size make pre post intervention . And muscle biopsy , blood urine collect legs pre post intervention . The relevant molecular pathway examine .</detailed_description>
