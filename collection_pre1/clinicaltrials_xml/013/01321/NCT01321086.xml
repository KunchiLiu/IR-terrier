	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct clinical research trial determine role motivational interviewing ( MI ) promote home-based walking therapy improve walk ability African Americans peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . African Americans two time likely non-Hispanic white suffer PAD . For patient PAD , significant risk poor walk ability limb loss . One major treatment PAD walk therapy traditional method delivery treatment require frequent visit university hospital-based site . The investigator address role self-managed walk program , conduct near home , improve limb function . In order motivate participant walk , investigator include two different intervention strategy : MI patient-centered counseling exercise ( PACE ) . The investigator hypothesize participant randomize MI arm great increase walk distance , compare receive Patient-Centered Assessment Counseling Exercise ( PACE ) control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MI effective counseling method individual less ready change behavior ( i.e. , low motivation ) . Thus , MI ideal counsel method promote home-based walking among AAs PAD . In pilot study promote home-based walking , use counsel protocol , Patient-centered Assessment Counseling Exercise ( PACE ) ( Sallis et al ) , target know modifiable determinant behavior change ( e.g. , social support ) . Using PACE , demonstrate improvement stair climb ability low limb blood flow ( measure ankle-brachial index ) . Improvements low limb outcome offer support use PACE counseling PAD , PACE specifically address low motivation - critical target AAs PAD . In addition , PACE culturally sensitive . In proposed trial , hypothesize MI improve walk distance reduce walk impairment PACE AAs PAD . There critical need improve low limb outcome AAs PAD . Our long-term goal reduce debilitate functional limitation amputation AAs PAD . The overall objective application determine effective counseling strategy improve home-based walking AAs PAD . We assemble excellent diverse research team requisite skill experience need study . Moreover , robust pilot data support study hypotheses ensure successful completion study . We deliver PACE protocol MI 6 month , use face-to-face visit telephone contact . Our primary outcome walk distance ( measure widely use well-validated 6-minute walk test ) end active intervention ( 6 month ) . Secondary outcome walk distance measure beyond active phase intervention ( 12 month ) , use home-based walking ( measured accelerometry ) , low limb blood flow ( measure ankle brachial index - ABI ) . Our comparison group receive print material two intervention well contact every three month update change contact information ass health status . We randomize 204 participant one three arm : Control Treatment One ( Tx1 ) ; PACE Treatment Two ( Tx2 ) ; MI , also refer Treatment Three ( Tx3 ) . In addition , determine efficacy PACE ( Tx2 ) increase walk distance AAs PAD , compare Control ( Tx1 ) . Primary Hypothesis : 1 . At 6 month , AAs PAD randomize MI ( Tx3 ) great increase walk distance , compare receive PACE ( Tx2 ) control group ( Tx1 ) . Secondary Hypotheses : 1 . AAs PAD randomize MI ( Tx3 ) great increase walk distance 12 month - follow-up period beyond six month active intervention - compare receive PACE ( Tx2 ) compare control group ( Tx1 ) . 2 . At 6 12 month , AAs PAD randomize MI ( Tx3 ) great increase home-based walk low limb blood flow , compare receive PACE ( Tx2 ) control group ( Tx1 ) . 3 . At 6 12 month , AAs PAD randomize PACE ( Tx2 ) great increase walk distance compare randomize control ( Tx1 ) . Exploratory Aim : We explore potential mediator ( self-efficacy , social support , intrinsic/extrinsic motivation ) moderator ( co-morbidities , leg symptom type , stage change ) intervention effect walk distance , home-based walking , low limb blood flow among AAs PAD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . African American ( determine selfreport ) 2 . Lived life United States 3 . Resting ABI &lt; 0.995 4 . English Speaking 5 . Has telephone 1 . Currently walk exercise least 5 day per week ( i.e. , PACE score range 58 ) ; rationale person currently walk least 5 day per week already sufficiently active therefore member target population motivational homebased walk intervention . 2 . Prior major amputation ( foot low leg ) critical leg ischemia ( tissue loss , gangrene , ulcer ) 3 . Rest pain ABI &lt; 0.4 nonpalpable femoral pulse without prior evaluation vascular surgeon , give need evaluation role invasive therapy prior recommend walk therapy 4 . Leg revascularization within 3 month enrollment plan revascularization study period ; rationale post intervention recovery potential complication likely limit patient 's ability adhere study protocol . 5 . Use supplemental oxygen ; rationale concern participant safety potential limited ability participate study secondary breathing difficulty . 6 . Myocardial infarction within precede 3 month ; rationale participant safety potential risk complication and/or need supervise cardiac rehabilitation follow event . 7 . Resting blood pressure &gt; 200/110 mmHg ; rationale participant safety , blood pressure may increase exercise increase risk cerebrovascular event myocardial infarction . 8 . Exerciseinduced coronary ischemic symptom , exerciseinduced ST depression &gt; 2.0 mm ; rationale participant safety need cardiac evaluation prior involvement walk therapy ( American College Cardiology/American Heart Association , 2006 ) . 9 . Inability walk 2 minute ; rationale people walk 2 minute would able complete necessary submaximal treadmill test , use screen coronary ischemic symptom . We also exclude anyone walk 20 minute submaximal treadmill test . Anyone complete submaximal test would significant walking impairment would get much study . Short Physical Performance Battery score 10 high person clinically significant impairment mobility ; therefore , exclude anyone score 10 high ( maximum 12 point ) .</criteria>
