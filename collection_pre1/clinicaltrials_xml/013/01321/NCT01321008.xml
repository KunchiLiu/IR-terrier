	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn radiation therapy chemotherapy help control stage 1 and/or 2 NK cell lymphoma . The safety radiation chemotherapy also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stage I/II Nasal NK Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Treatments : Radiation therapy design kill cancer cell stop cancer cell grow . CHOP chemotherapy make drug cyclophosphamide , hydroxydaunorubicin ( doxorubicin ) , oncovin ( vincristine ) , prednisone . It design help control tumor locally well tumor cell might escape move body . Radiation Therapy : You receive radiation therapy 5 day week 28 30 treatment . You receive separate consent form describe procedure risk detail . Study Visits During Radiation Therapy : Every week 6 week radiation therapy : - You ask feel side effect may . - Your performance status record . - You physical exam . Chemotherapy Administration : The amount time finish radiation therapy begin receive chemotherapy depend recovery time side effect may . This 3-4 week . On Day 1 receive cyclophosphamide vein 1 hour , doxorubicin vein 15 minute , vincristine vein 15 minute . You take prednisone mouth Days 1-5 cycle . Each cycle 21-days long ( long take longer blood count recover ) . You receive 4 cycle chemotherapy . Study Visits During Chemotherapy : Before Day 1 Cycle 1 : - You CT scan head , neck , chest , abdomen pelvis . - You Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan head neck . - You ask drug may take symptom may . - Your performance status record . - You physical exam , include measurement height weight . - You echocardiogram ( ECHO ) MUltiple Gated Acquisition scan ( MUGA ) scan . - You x-ray chest . - You Electrocardiography ( ECG ) . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) pregnancy test . On Day 15 Cycle 1 : - You ask drug may take symptom may . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2-4 : - You ask drug may take symptom may . - Your performance status record . - You ECG . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 15 Cycles 2-4 : -Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You may receive radiation 4 cycle CHOP . You longer able receive CHOP disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Your participation study end-of-study follow-up visit . Follow-Up End-of-Study Visits : If leave study early : - You compute tomography ( CT ) scan head , neck , chest , abdomen pelvis . - You MRI scan head neck . - You positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT scan . - Any skin lesion may relate tumor measure photograph . - You ask drug may take symptom may . - Your performance status record . - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Routine Follow-up : - You also routine follow-up visit every 3 month 1st year , every 4 month 2nd year , every 6 month 3rd-5th year . After , follow visit 1 time every year . At visit , follow test procedure record : - You CT scan head , neck , chest , abdomen pelvis . - You MRI scan head neck . - You PET/CT scan . - You ask symptom may . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>

This include : ) Congestive heart failure class III/IV ( CHF ) per new york heart association ( NYHA ) criterion . b ) Cardiomyopathy , c ) Uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , ) Unstable angina pectoris , e ) Recent Myocardial infarction ( MI ) ( within 6 month ) . 5 . Patients prior exposure anthracyclines : 6 . Patients pregnant breastfeeding . 7 . Patients psychiatric illness and/or social situation would limit compliance study medication requirement . 8 . Prior radiation site current primary disease , retreatment would lead violation know radiation dose tolerance limit site .</criteria>
