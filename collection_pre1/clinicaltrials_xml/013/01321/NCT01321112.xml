	<detailed_description>Introduction : Immunosuppressive treatment ( IS ) several frequents adverse effect ; among : severe infection , diabetes mellitus , arterial hypertension , osteoporosis , neurologic disorder , renal failure , dyslipemias , increase cardiovascular risk , cancer , etc . After 5 year , 18 % liver receptor develop renal failure , risk develop cancer three time higher LT 30 % liver graft receptor previously infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) cirrhosis 5 year LT , probably effect IS viral kinetics . An ideal situation would liver transplant recipient receive enough IS inhibit immune response allograft , avoid excessive effect capacity immune system recognize pathogen , tumoral cell minimize adverse effect even , indefinite graft acceptance complete absence IS , concept clinic call operational tolerance ( OT ) . OT occur around 20 % liver recipient . So although potential benefit important affect small fraction liver recipient . A different related strategy evaluate several trial past , consist change IS base calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) another less intense base mofetil mycophenolate ( MMF ) , know less adverse effect , preserve renal function affect function proliferation T regulatory cell , involve development OT . In recent study ( press ) , investigator perform IS withdrawal hundred liver recipient investigator find classify operationally tolerant ( 40 % ) long time elapse since LT IS withdrawal , receive low dos CNI receive MMF monotherapy . The investigator able also discriminate operationally tolerant liver recipient develop rejection base differential gene expression ( evaluated whole genome microarray ) ISwithdrawal . Study 's aim : perform IS conversion CNI MMF monotherapy look transcriptional biomarkers employ whole genome expression study perform microarrays baseline liver tissue PBMCs try find set differentially express gene able correlate successful conversion thus , generate set transcriptional biomarkers potentially able predict result IS conversion independent cohort liver recipient . Methods : Forty patient recruit among cohort liver transplant recipient . The study last 48 week . Inclusion criterion ) liver transplantation 2 year ago , b ) stable graft function , b ) history autoimmune liver disease , c ) absence rejection last 12 month , ) Use calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) monotherapy , e ) absence rejection baseline liver biopsy , ) tacrolimus trough level &gt; 3 ng/ml cyclosporine C2 level &gt; 30 ng/ml , e ) signature inform consent form . After screen procedure mycophenolate mofetil start ( week -4 ) dose 500 mg twice day two week ( week -2 ) increase 1000 mg twice day CNI reduce 50 % initial dose . After two week ( week 0 ) CNI completely discontinue ( complete IS conversion ) . The investigator follow patient every 4 week 48 week complete IS conversion . The complete study period last 52 week . At baseline mRNA fron liver sample peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolate . This mRNA use evaluate whole genome expression use Affimetrix microarrays . Besides , T regulatory cell frequency measure use peripheral blood cell immunophenotyping baseline end follow . Clinical variable evaluate determined evolution renal function cardiovascular risk factor . Expected result : The investigator expect end study recipient able successful rejection minor group ( around 30 % ) able rejection . Then baseline mRNA sample use perform whole genome microarrays . Using bioinformatics procedure investigator make attempt establish differential gene expression among successful conversion develop rejection . This allow investigator determine small set gene able discriminate patient . Gene expression also correlate peripheral blood cell immunophenotyping clinical variable .</detailed_description>
