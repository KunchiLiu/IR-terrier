	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn Vibativ ( telavancin ) help control blood stream infection ( BSIs ) . The safety treatment also study . Objectives : Evaluate clinical efficacy safety Telavancin give treatment gram positive bacteremia cancer patient ( include neutropenics ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Telavancin Treatment Gram Positive Bloodstream Infections Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : Telavancin antibiotic design treat variety bacterial infection difficult treat . Central Venous Catheter ( CVC ) : A CVC sterile flexible tube could place large vein local anesthesia . If certain type infection , doctor may decide remove exchange CVC . The decision remove exchange CVC time placement new CVC decide primary doctor . If get new CVC , doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form . Study Treatment : If find eligible take part study , receive telavancin vein period 60 minute daily least 7 day 6 week . How long receive study drug depend type bacterial infection doctor think may complicate bacterial infection blood . If doctor think mixed infection ( 2 certain type bacteria ) , may also give another type antibiotic ( aztreonam , cefepime , imipenem , meropenem , ciprofloxacin hydrochloride , bactrim , piperacillin/tazobactam and/or amoxicillin/clavulanate ) . If doctor think need , echocardiogram check heart function . This test perform specific type infection ( make sure inflammation line heart ) . You ask medication take . If discharge hospital complete study drug , able take drug outpatient . Your primary doctor may arrange receive medication M. D. Anderson . Study Visits : Once week : - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . It may draw CVC , CVC still place . - The CVC exit site check visit sign symptom infection . - You ask symptom illness may since last visit . Every day , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check infection longer show sign infection . Kidney function monitor perform blood test every 2 day first week weekly . Length Study : You receive study drug 6 week . You take study infection get bad intolerable side effect occur . End-of-Study Visit Follow-up Visit : You need return MD Anderson end treatment visit , within 7 day last dose study drug . The end-of-study visit occur within 7 day last dose study drug . The follow-up visit occur 32 day ( 1 month ) last dose study drug . At visit , follow exams/procedures perform . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test check bacterial infection . The blood sample may draw CVC , CVC still place . The CVC exit site examine . - You ask symptom illness may since last visit . - You ask drug therapy may take end treatment . - If infection recur follow-up period , doctor think need , echocardiogram check heart function make sure inflammation line heart . This investigational study . Telavancin FDA approve commercially available treatment infection skin soft tissue . Its use treat blood infection study investigational . Up 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients probable definite diagnosis uncomplicated gram positive bacteremia least one positive blood culture include 20 patient Staphylococcus aureus 20 patient include follow organism ( CNS , Enterococci , streptococci , pneumococcus , Corynebacterium , Propionibacterium Bacillus specie ) .If positive blood culture involve commensal skin organism CNS , Corynebacterium , Propionibacterium , Micrococcus Bacillus , least &gt; 100 colonies/ml require time positivity =/ &lt; 16 hour ( show reflect high grade bacteremia ) , two positive blood culture . ( Time positivity blood culture bottle record microbiology laboratory automatic culture detector ( Bactec 9240 Bactec Plus Aerobic/F ; Becton Dickinson ) record culture positivity every 15 min accord change fluorescence related microbial growth ) . 2 . Patients must least two sign sepsis list , combination time , within 48 hour prior Telavancin therapy : . Core temperature =/ &gt; 38.0 degree C =/ &lt; 36.0 degree C , measure orally , rectally , tympanic ally via central catheter . If auxiliary add 0.5 degree C measure temperature ; b. Pulse rate =/ &gt; 100 beats/min . ; c. Respiratory rate =/ &gt; 20/min . ; d. WBC count =/ &gt; 12,000/mm^3 , =/ &lt; 4,000/mm differential count show &gt; 10 % band form ; e. Systolic blood pressure =/ &lt; 90 mm Hg . Patient still eligible study participant white blood cell count ( WBC ) outside normal limit due chemotherapy treatment underlying condition . 3 . Male nonpregnant , nonlactating female age great equal 18 year . 4 . Signed informed consent . 5 . Female patient must risk pregnancy one follow reason : Postmenopausal least one year Posthysterectomy and/or postbilateral ovariectomy If childbearing potential , negative serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) pregnancy test 5 day prior enrollment use highly effective method birth control throughout course study . Reliable sexual abstinence throughout course study acceptable highly effective method birth control purpose study . 1 . Estimated Serum Creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 mL/min ( accord CockGaultformula use ideal body weight ) time gram positive bacteremia diagnose unless patient dialysis . 2 . Bilirubin &gt; 4x upper limit normal time gram positive bacteremia diagnose . 3 . Treatment antibiotic , vancomycin , linezolid , tigecycline Telavancin , effective resistant gram positive bacterial infection , methicillin resistant staphylococci , 48 hour within 72 hour study medication initiation , unless treatment fail defined persistent fever and/or leukocytosis 72 hour longer appropriate antibiotic treatment . 4 . History hypersensitivity lipoglycopeptides . 5 . Presence deepsited intravascular source infection organism culture blood , e.g . endocarditis ( evidenced vegetation echocardiogram ) , septic thrombosis . 6 . Presence prosthetic valve . 7 . Oliguria define urine output &lt; 20 cc/hour average 24 hour .</criteria>
