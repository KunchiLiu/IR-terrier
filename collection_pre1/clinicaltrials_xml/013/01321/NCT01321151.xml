	<brief_summary>Sports-related concussion serious problem football , boxing , full contact sport . After experience consecutive concussion , increase neurological deficit lead long-term cognitive problem ( Dementia pugilistica ) . To combat increase brain damage , novel strategy need develop protect athlete participate full contact sport . The purpose study elucidate whether resveratrol decrease brain injury improve brain function experience concussion boxer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Resveratrol Decrease Acute Secondary Brain Injury Following Sports-Related Concussions Boxers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year , approximately 3 million sports-related concussion occur athlete . Only 5 % concussion treat hospital setting . To date , effective intervention use decreasing level oxidant injury inflammation within athlete . The standard form care athletes usually rest light exercise 1 -2 week , return sport . Within brain injury population , administration neuro-protectant agent immediately follow concussion may alleviate prevent secondary injury subsequent development long-term cognitive deficit Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy ( CTE ) Dementia pugilistica ( DP ) . Since sports-related concussion serious problem youth , use safe intervention , believe level oxidant injury brain inflammation decrease . In addition , neuro-protective agent may improve cognition boxer , decrease incidence DP . Following brain injury , secondary injury immediately follow consists heighten damage oxygen radical , turn damage vital lipid , protein , nucleic acid . This damage exacerbate highly acidic condition lead release iron production harmful oxygen radical . An increase oxygen radical observe minute hour within primary injury . In addition , increase inflammation well excitotoxicity brain traumatic injury . To combat secondary injury , use anti-oxidants individual warrant decrease amount brain damage cognitive decline experience severe brain injury . For example , resveratrol ( 3,5,4'-trihydroxystilbene ) polyphenol compound commonly find grape , nutritional supplement anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory property great promise treat TBI secondary injury . A number researcher demonstrate resveratrol protect multiple organ ( heart , kidney , brain ) ischemia injury . With respect brain , resveratrol show protect oxidative stress , Huntington 's disease , stroke . Additionally , follow TBI various animal model , resveratrol protect severe brain injury . Results brain study suggest resveratrol protects plethora injury may afford protection secondary injury individual suffer severe brain injury . In pilot clinical trial , boxer ( n=30 ) consent participate study prior engage box match . The concussion history collect enrol . Baseline cognitive test magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan perform obtain structural functional data . Only 12 boxer concussion enrol study . After participate box match , boxer diagnose concussion ringside physician , boxer treat oral dose active trans-resveratrol ( 500 mg ) placebo within 2 hour completion box match . The boxer treat either resveratrol placebo ( depend randomization schedule ) day 30 day . Cognitive test MRI scan conduct day 7 concussion .</detailed_description>
