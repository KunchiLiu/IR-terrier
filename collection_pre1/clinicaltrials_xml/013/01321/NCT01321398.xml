	<brief_summary>Patients severe lung condition occasionally require support special ventilator ( breathe machine ) call High Frequency Oscillator ( HFO ) . Effective ventilation require pressure generate ventilator high possible high damage lung . In patient HFO , well defined way measure pressure . We insert small probe esophagus patient HFO see accurate way measure lung pressure patient . A good understanding pressure could lead improved patient care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trials find use low tidal volume ( 6 ml/kg ) conventional mechanical ventilation decrease morbidity mortality . Compared conventional ventilation , high frequency oscillation ( HFO ) able provide much small tidal volume ( 1.1 - 2.5 ml/kg ) thus theoretically may provide additional lung protection . At time , trial HFO adult inconclusive , use HFO management ALI/ARDS become widespread Patients acute lung injury ( ALI ) acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) critically ill high mortality associate illness ( approximately 50 % ) . Currently , esophageal pressure monitor use optimize inflation pressure improve oxygenation conventional mechanical ventilation patient ALI/ARDS . With mind , purpose study twofold : ( 1 ) demonstrate esophageal pressure monitor easily insert patient undergo HFO ( 2 ) report transpulmonary pressure patient .</detailed_description>
