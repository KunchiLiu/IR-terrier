A Fixed Dose Combination ( FDC , polypill ) include three component well demonstrate efficacy improve secondary prevention coronary patient decrease inappropriate prescribe reduce complexity treatment lack adherence . - Phase 1 descriptive , non-interventional study . Its aim provide comprehensive analysis potential factor preclude adequate secondary prevention , include Health system characteristic , drug affordability availability , well patient ' characteristic . Differences two studied region ( Europe South America ) analyze . - Phase 2 interventional , randomized trial prospective economic evaluation . It organise two-arm , randomise , parallel , multinational study . Patients complete Phase 1 , fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion ( see ) , include Phase 2 . Patients randomize receive FDC ramipril , simvastatin acetylsalicylic acid three medication separately .</detailed_description>
