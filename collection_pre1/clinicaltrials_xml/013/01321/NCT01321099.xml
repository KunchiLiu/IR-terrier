	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency ( ID ) still main public health problem sub-Saharan Africa . Iron deficient child increase risk anemia associate adverse infant development might partly irreversible . In sub-Saharan Africa , etiology ID child multifactoral ; major cause low iron dietary bioavailability intake monotonous cereal-based complementary food . Children &lt; 5 year old benefit iron-fortified complementary food ; however , fortify complementary food often adapt requirement child specific set . The investigator develop complementary food fortificant ( CFF ) add local porridge deem meet nutrient intake requirement iron child 1-3 year age . The CFF lipid-based therefore , regularly use , increase daily energy intake child often low develop country cereal-based diet . The iron absorption mixture CFF porridge optimize contains quite high amount phytate , well-known inhibitor iron absorption . To optimize iron absorption investigator plan three iron absorption study use different compound iron ( FeSO4 + NaFeEDTA ) , additional vitamin C phytase , able degrade phytate . In first study , iron absorption determine mixture CFF porridge fortify 1 ) 6 mg FeSO4 2 ) 6 mg FeSO4 plus additional vitamin C. In second study , test meal fortify 1 ) 6 mg FeSO4 2 ) mixture 3 mg FeSO4 + 3 mg NaFeEDTA . In third study , test meal fortify 1 ) 6 mg FeSO4 , 2 ) 6 mg FeSO4 plus phytase , 3 ) 6 mg FeSO4 plus additional vitamin C phytase . Iron absorption determine incorporation label iron erythrocyte , 14 day administration test meal contain label iron ( stable isotope technique ) . Sixty apparently healthy Beninese child 12-36 month age body weight &gt; 8.3 kg include study . Additionally , investigator test acceptability CFFs base different composition formula interview parents/legal guardian child feed CFF define period . The result study provide important insight optimize iron absorption young child CFF mix local traditional porridge develop country . Furthermore study provide information acceptability CFFs setting .</brief_summary>
