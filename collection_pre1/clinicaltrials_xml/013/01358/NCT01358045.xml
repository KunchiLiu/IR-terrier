	<brief_summary>Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) frequent malignant tumor Caucasians incidence still increase 3-8 % year . Since BCCs generally occur sun-exposed area skin , rice incidence mainly explain increase exposure ( intermittent ) ultraviolet radiation . Surgical excision still standard treatment ( micro ) nodular BCCs . The cost well increase workload stress health care system even pose BCC important health care problem . Since half BCCs arise primarily face &amp; ( bald ) head treatment surgical excision may result disfigure scar , patient often experience dramatic decrease quality life . Hence , urgent medical societal need simple cheap ( target ) treatment , preferably perform patient . This treatment must safe effective . Such treatment available yet . BCC tumorigenesis complex must multifactorial . Genetic alteration multiple component Sonic Hedgehog ( SHH ) pathway involved sporadic BCC pathogenesis ; inactivate mutation Patched-1 ( PTCH1 ) activate mutation Smoothened ( SMO ) Suppressor Fused ( SU ( FU ) ) . With knowledge , inhibition SHH pathway SMO antagonists successfully administer , however treatment result partial clinical response ofBCC . Recently , involvement Wingless ( Wnt ) pathway proven essential BCC tumorigenic response . Moreover , recent study department provide first evidence epigenetic alteration , particularly promoter hypermethylation , influence SHH Wnt pathway ( data , publish ) , serve therapeutic target . Both non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAlDS ) vitamin D derivatives able directly indirectly target Wnt pathway . Furthermore , vitamin D3 able inhibit Smoothened ( SMO ) vitro , result inhibition SHH pathway . Although vivo study lack , investigator assume topical application drug may inhibit BCC growth and/or may cure BCC thus might provide promising future perspective . Calcitriol NSAlDs ointment already available indication save use . Eventually , approach may result systematic approach BCC , target ( epi ) genetic change treat and/or prevent tumour growth .</brief_summary>
