	<brief_summary>This Phase I , open-label , single-dose study design assess effect hepatic dysfunction PK orally administer Fx-1006A 20 mg soft gelatin capsule . An adaptive 2-stage study design implement . Initially ( Stage 1 ) , group 9 subject moderate hepatic dysfunction ( Child-Pugh score 7-9 , inclusive ) follow group 9 healthy volunteer subject normal hepatic function comparable age , gender , weight hepatically impaired subject enrol receive single oral 20 mg dose Fx-1006A . Data obtain first 2 group analyze review Sponsor determine whether Fx-1006A PK alter hepatic dysfunction . If determine hepatic dysfunction affect Fx-1006A PK , Stage 2 commence . During Stage 2 , group 9 subject mild impairment ( Child-Pugh score 5-6 , inclusive ) enrol receive single oral 20 mg dose Fx-1006A . Additional subject normal hepatic function may enrol ensure appropriate demographic match mild hepatically impaired subject , respect age , gender , weight . During Screening , subject provide write informed consent participate study review study entrance criterion ( include assessment hepatic function ) determine eligibility . All subject provide blood urine sample clinical laboratory testing , drug testing , pregnancy test determine eligibility . Subjects meet entrance criterion Screening check clinical site 1 day prior dose ( Day 0 ) evening , review entrance criterion confirm eligibility . Subjects remain inpatient overnight pre-dose assessment . Subjects fast minimum 8 hour prior dose follow day ( water allow ) . The single Fx-1006A dose administer Day 1 supervision Investigator appropriate clinical site staff . Subjects remain fasted 4 hour dose ( water allow ) remain inpatient overnight safety monitoring PK sample collection . Subjects discharge Day 2 , complete study procedure Investigator determine subject clinically stable . Subjects return clinical site out-patient visit Days 3 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 16 safety evaluation PK sample collection . Day 16 end study visit .</brief_summary>
