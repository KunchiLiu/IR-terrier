	<brief_summary>The aortic valve main outlet valve heart . This valve become diseased narrowed need replace artificial valve . Currently , common reason someone undergo heart valve operation UK . Unfortunately , medical treatment prevent delay progression disease process . Here , investigator propose use new state-of-the-art imaging technique well understand disease process investigator effectively design assess potential new treatment . The ultimate aim stop disease patient need surgery . In addition investigator believe technique allow u predict rate progression disease</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Active Valvular Calcification Inflammation Patients With Aortic Stenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aortic stenosis common valvular heart disease western world lead indication valve surgery . Histological study suggest similarity atherosclerosis include inflammation , lipid deposition , increased macrophage activity calcification . However , recent randomise controlled trial fail demonstrate reduction rate disease progression statin therapy investigator believe need re-evaluate underlying factor involve initiation progression aortic stenosis . The investigator propose assess role inflammation calcification pathogenesis progression aortic stenosis use positron emission tomography [ 18F ] -fluorodeoxyglucose [ 18F- ] -fluoride patient range aortic valve disease . The investigator hypothesise increase severity valvular inflammation calcification correlate disease severity rate disease progression . This work lay foundation subsequent application intervention target inflammation calcification .</detailed_description>
