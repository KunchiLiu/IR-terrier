	<brief_summary>The hypothesis study among patient develop overt hypothyroidism hemithyroidectomy , weight gain clinical manifestation postoperatively lower set point thyroid function - even thyroid function lower within laboratory reference range . The investigator refer hypothesize condition individual subclinical hypothyroidism . Thyroid hormones major regulator mitochondrial function subclinical hypothyroidism affect mitochondrial activity . The aim study examine lower set point thyroid function hemithyroidectomy measure mitochondrial function , body weight basal oxygen consumption .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ThyrOp : A Study Individual Subclinical Hypothyroidism After Hemithyroidectomy Benign Nontoxic Goiter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The operation hemithyroidectomy ( total thyroid lobectomy isthmusectomy preservation contralateral lobe ) indicate patient unilateral thyroid mass cause compressive symptom , cosmetic concern exclude thyroid carcinoma . The incidence risk factor development hypothyroidism hemithyroidectomy remain unclear . The report rate postoperative hypothyroidism vary 5.0 % 41.9 % variable follow-up definition hypothyroidism ( Wormald et al ) . There nationally universally accept guideline monitor thyroid function hemithyroidectomy . Subclinical hypothyroidism associate increase risk coronary heart event coronary heart mortality ( Rodondi et al ) high level thyrotropin ( within laboratory reference range ) relate increase risk fatal coronary heart disease ( Asvold et al ) Variation thyroid function see individual also within normal range . The individual variation serum level thyroid hormone thyrotropin measurement individual relatively small compare variation individual ( Andersen et al ) . This implicate around half laboratory reference range thyrotropin abnormal give individual . The fact thyrotropin value individual within reference range still represent abnormal thyroid function give person consequence monitor thyroid function hemithyroidectomy . It imply postoperative thyroid function monitor preoperative thyroid function mind postoperative hypothyroidism understood broad term . After hemithyroidectomy change individual unique set point result lower thyroid function represent condition investigator refer individual subclinical hypothyroidism . Weight gain follow hemithyroidectomy benign nodular goiter among patient develop overt hypothyroidism frequent clinical observation . Body weight influenced many factor , among thyroid function . Even small difference thyroid function s-thyrotropin variation within normal laboratory range patient T4 substitution therapy associate difference rest energy expenditure . A prolonged decrease REE could lead increase body weight ( al-Adsani et al ) . Overweight obesity major threat public health . The importance lifestyle weight gain doubt factor slight difference thyroid function might importance risk gain weight well ( Knudsen et al ) . The mitochondrion provide cellular energy convert oxygen nutrient ATP aerobe respiration mitochondrial energy production regulate thyroid hormone ( Weitzel et al ) . Subclinical hypothyroidism previously show affect mitochondrial function mononuclear blood cell ( Kvetny et al ) . The investigator hypothesize hemithyroidectomy patient develop lower thyroid function result postoperative high value serum thyrotropin consequence less negative feed-back pituitary gland . Weather postoperative lower thyroid function result overt hypothyroidism ( serum thyrotropin upper reference limit , lower serum level free T3 T4 ) , subclinical ( serum thyrotropin upper reference limit , free T3 T4 within reference range ) individual subclinical hypothyroidism ( serum thyrotropin rise within reference range , free T3 T4 within reference range ) depend preoperative set point thyroid function give patient either condition represent condition abnormal . The investigator hypothesize postoperative lower thyroid function affect mitochondrial function result weight gain .</detailed_description>
