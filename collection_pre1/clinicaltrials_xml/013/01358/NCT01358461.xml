	<brief_summary>Context The investigator recently demonstrate highly significant increase muscarinic receptor density myocardium infant decease sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) compare infant decease identified cause 1 . Muscarinic receptor overexpression find SIDS sample study date . It associate average increase acetylcholinesterase activity , appear compensatory mechanism oppose cardiac muscarinic receptor overexpression . Similar vago-cardiac abnormality detect rabbit model vagal hyperreactivity investigator first describe year ago2 . In hyperreactive animal , expression muscarinic receptor also enhance blood white cell . Noticeably , pattern change cell parallel pattern change heart . Thus , muscarinic abnormality cardiac tissue could infer high confidence measure lymphocytes.This first report vago-cardiac abnormality sudden infant death syndrome . The investigator finding also provide original important perspective identification therapeutic management infant risk sudden death . As , publication investigator work raise major interest population scientific medical community , particular cardio-pediatricians . ObjectivesThe objective present clinical project validate , human lymphocyte , muscarinic receptor expression level ( assessed quantitative RT-PCR ) circulate biomarker autonomic nervous system dysfunction specifically , vagal hyperactivity risk sudden death . The project include 2 major item , conduct parallel:1. evaluation muscarinic receptor expression lymphocytes adult vagal syncope ( n=60 patient exist file versus 60 control ) ( Cardiology unit + Clinical Investigation Centre ( CIC ) + Laboratory Neurobiology Cardiovascular Pharmacology ) ; 2. evaluation muscarinic receptor expression lymphocytes child vagal syncope ( n=60 versus 60 control ) ( Pediatry unit + Clinical Investigation Centre + Laboratory Neurobiology Cardiovascular Pharmacology ) .PerspectivesThis project represent first step validation circulate marker vagal hyperactivity risk SIDS human . Once step complete , investigator start prospective study `` muscarinic receptor expression lymphocytes SIDS `` ( cord blood collect birth follow new-borns ) ( Maternity ward + CIC + Laboratory Neurobiology Cardiovascular Pharmacology ) . Then therapeutic preventive management become realistic objective . A therapeutic clinical study start atropinic drug , order test potential protective action sudden death . The final objective investigator research prevention SIDS ) identification - soon birth - new-borns high risk ii ) appropriate prophylactic therapy . The investigator work also open excite perspective field still poorly understood vagal disorder child adult vagal pauses.1 Livolsi et coll , Plos One 5 , e9464 , 2010 ; 2 Livolsi et coll , Circulation 106 , 2301-2304 , 2002</brief_summary>
