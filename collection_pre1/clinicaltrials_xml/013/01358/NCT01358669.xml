	<brief_summary>Although hip replacement surgery successful way deal pain immobility cause hip arthritis , 10 % hip replacement carry UK fail within 10 year . The main reason development periprosthetic osteolysis , , loss bone around site hip replacement . The osteolysis think due small particle debris worn surface hip implant . These particle cause reaction blood cell around joint turn affect bone cell lead loss bone around implant . The joint implant eventually become loose unstable , condition know aseptic loosening . At present way treat aseptic loosening another operation secure hip joint , know revision surgery . Revision surgery always successful expose patient risk major surgery . In study explore potential give medication ( denosumab ) may prevent loss bone around hip replacement implant . We recruit patient list revision surgery . One group patient give single dose denosumab; another group give placebo ( dummy drug ) . At time revision surgery small sample bone around hip replacement take examined microscope . Comparisons make patient denosumab placebo find whether denosumab beneficial effect bone surface . If successful , study lead study develop use denosumab prevent aseptic loosening .</brief_summary>
