	<brief_summary>Rationale : Scars highly disfigure may result functional impairment psychosocial problem . Recently , fractional laser therapy ( FLT ) introduce promising novel treatment modality scar . Objectives : The primary objective study assess efficacy safety 10600 nm FLT treatment different type scar . Study design : Prospective observer blind randomise control split-lesion trial . Study population : Thirty consecutive patient , age least 18 year , hypertrophic atrophic scar give write informed consent . Methods : Two similar test region scar randomly allocate either 3 session FLT ( UltraPulse Encore 10600 nm Total FX ) interval 4 week treatment . Main study parameters/endpoints : Blinded Physicians Global Assessment main outcome variable . Secondary variable Patient 's Global Assessment , blind clinical assessment scar scale 0-3 ( erythema , pigmentation , texture , hypertrophy , atrophy , pliability ) , Patient Observer Scar Scale ( POSAS ) , objective colour measurement reflectance spectroscopy ( LAB ) chromameter ( erythema index , melanin index ) . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Subjects participate study request visit SNIP ( Amsterdam ) 3 time treatment 2 time follow-up . The time investment per visit 30 minute treatment session 20 minute follow-up visit . FLT use 10600 nm laser device minimally invasive laser procedure FDA approval device ( Lumenis Encore 10600 nm ) indication ( scar ) . Local side effect erythema ( always ; 1-2 week ) , ooze ( often ; 1-3 day ) , swell ( always , 1-4 day ) , blister &lt; 0.5cm ( occasionally ) blister &gt; 0.5cm ( rare ) . No systemic side effect know laser device . All outcome measure involve non-invasive procedure . The laser treatment ( FLT ) require local anesthesia . The amount topical anesthetic use infiltration low ( approximately 5 % maximum dose ) minimize risk local systemic side effect due anesthetic agent . All together burden due study moderate , side effect generally local mild . Systemic side effect report treatment . There indirect benefit participate subject . In case improvement treat test region , therapy directly utilized treat whole scar . Considering relative lack alternative treatment option many scar , balance burden , possible side effect prospect improvement favorable .</brief_summary>
