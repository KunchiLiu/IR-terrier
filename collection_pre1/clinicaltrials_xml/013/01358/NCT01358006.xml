	<brief_title>A Dose-Ranging Study JNJ-40411813 Healthy Male Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( volunteer study staff know identity assign treatment ) , dose-ranging study determine 5-HT2A receptor engagement JNJ-40411813 function dose time healthy male volunteer . The study consist eligibility screen examination , open-label treatment period follow-up examination ( approximately 10 day dose administration , follow-up examination perform ) . Initially , 4 volunteer ( Cohort 1 ) include determine 5-HT2A receptor occupancy follow single dose administration JNJ-40411813 . Dependent result , dose remain 8 volunteer ( Cohort 2 3 ) select characterize 5-HT2A receptor occupancy within feasible dose range maximally 700 mg JNJ-40411813.The maximal study duration volunteer 6 week . In study , [ 11C ] -MDL 100,907 use positron emission tomography ( PET ) ligand investigate concentration-related bind 40411813 5-HT2A receptor brain . JNJ-40411813 ( 200 mg 700 mg ) take orally ( mouth ) . If multiple capsule take , actual intake may spread 15-minute period . Study drug administer volunteer completion meal within 30 minute start meal .</detailed_description>
