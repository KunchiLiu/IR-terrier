	<brief_title>Phase II Study NGR-hTNF Versus Placebo Maintenance Treatment Patients With Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>First-line treatment advance malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) base six cycle pemetrexed-based chemotherapy , median progression-free survival ( PFS ) approximately 6 months.However , median time completion first-line treatment initiation second-line therapy approximately 3 month . Recent experience non-small cell lung cancer patient show maintenance treatment give immediately first-line treatment regimen improve PFS survival . Considering toxicity profile NGR-hTNF characterize mild-to-moderate constitutional symptom register phase II trial previously treat MPM patient , well disease control observed half patient maintain four month nine month triweekly weekly cohort , respectively , seem justified compare randomize phase II trial time-related efficacy NGR-hTNF placebo advance MPM patient progress six cycle standard pemetrexed-based treatment .</detailed_description>
