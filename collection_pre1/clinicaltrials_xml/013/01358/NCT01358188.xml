	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease ( GD ) , inherited deficiency lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase characterize accumulation abnormal lipid cell immune system , call macrophage . Lipid engorge macrophage , become activated , also call `` Gaucher cell '' . The mechanisms leading macrophage activation fully know , however several finding individual GD , non-specific inflammation , clinically resemble rheumatic disease increase sedimentation rate , joint pain , extreme fatigue , addition poor wound healing , predisposition diabetes may suggest inappropriately function immune system GD . The pathway lead macrophage activation could relate accumulation lipid metabolite effect immune cell . In study , immunologic profile functional assay perform peripheral blood sample patient GD . The identification immunologic basis GD lead development new disease marker different treatment option .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Activated lipid engorge macrophage hallmark Gaucher disease ( GD ) . The evidence activation come clinical find 1000-fold increase serum chitotriosidase , chitinase specifically secrete activated macrophage . While marker decrease initiation therapy , specific organ involvement . The mechanisms macrophage activation unclear , however , presence non-specific inflammatory response ( e.g . high sedimentation rate ) , poor wound heal insulin resistance Gaucher patient point clinical relevance . The finding T , B NK cell abnormality Gaucher patient also suggest either direct effect GD lipid metabolite indirect mechanism via macrophage . Therefore , understand mechanisms macrophage activation crosstalk immune cell type could provide mechanistic insight pathogenesis GD . The investigator hypothesize GD mechanism lead macrophage activation could relate either directly accumulation lipid metabolite effect cell immune system . To determine pathway lead macrophage dysregulation GD , investigator evaluate functional response monocyte isolate GD patient profile T cell NK cell subset peripheral blood patient . The investigator assess whether macrophage dysfunction GD cause primary alteration immune response ( NK T cell response ) secondary due direct effect substrate accumulation perform immunological profiling GD patient blood sample , functional assay . Identification immunological basis GD pathogenesis could lead development biomarkers novel approach therapeutic intervention alleviate disease symptom . In addition , study reveal novel effect accumulation lipid substrate GD modulating macrophage lymphocyte subset .</detailed_description>
