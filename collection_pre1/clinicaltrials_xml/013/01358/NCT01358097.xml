	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate role immune system response squamous cell cancer head neck treatment include radiation therapy . Current research demonstrate several natural immune cell molecule affect way body 's immune system interact cancerous growth . Some cancer may relate infection virus , Human Papilloma Virus ( HPV ) . Studying activity immune system head neck cancer , especially cancer related HPV infection , provide valuable information well understand body 's interaction cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Immune Activation Response Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study immune response patient oropharyngeal cancer undergo treatment radiation , chemoradiation , robotic surgery . Many oropharyngeal cancer cause infection human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) , patient HPV-mediated tumor much good prognosis treatment response compare patient HPV-negative tumor . The investigator test hypothesis radiation-based therapy oropharyngeal cancer associate activation endogenous HPV-specific immune response . In study investigator collect blood several time point , , treatment monitor immune response patient tumor positive negative HPV versus normal healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>
