	<detailed_description>Background Antimicrobial resistance become world-wide problem antibiotic consumption major drive force development resistance . Thus optimization antibiotic prescription reduction unnecessary antimicrobial treatment essential prevention reduction antimicrobial resistance rate . The goal study qualitative quantitative improvement antibiotic prescription outpatient care . The study take place within Swiss-wide sentinel surveillance network consist general practitioner , pediatrician physician specialize internal medicine . The participate physician randomise control intervention group . The intervention group receive therapeutic guideline treatment upper low respiratory tract infection low urinary tract infection . Furthermore , regular feed-backs prescription pattern sentinel physician last month provide . Information antibiotic prescription , indication characteristic patient collect sentinel physician . The standardized reporting antibiotic prescription sentinel physician carry Switzerland since 2006 . Our hypothesis intervention affect antibiotic prescription pattern investigator observe optimization antibiotic prescription decrease number antibiotic prescription . Objective Primary goal : - Increase percentage penicillin prescription upper low respiratory tract infection - Increase percentage TMP/SMX prescription low urinary tract infection adults Secondary goal : - Decrease percentage quinolone prescription COPD exacerbation adult - Decrease number antibiotic prescription sinusitis upper respiratory tract infection Methods Prospective cluster-randomised intervention study . The intervention mail treatment guideline upper low respiratory tract infection low urinary tract infection well regular feed-backs antibiotic prescription pattern sentinel physician past month .</detailed_description>
