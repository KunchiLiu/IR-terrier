	<brief_summary>All study treatment proven efficacy treatment Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . It hop patient achieve good response induction therapy consist either 4 cycle BEACOPPesc ( Bleomycin , Etoposide , Doxorubicin , Cyclophosphamide , Vincristine , Procarbazine , Prednisone ) 2 cycle BEACOPPesc plus 2 cycle ABVD ( Adriamycine , Bléomycine , Vinblastine , Décarbazine ) . The use F-FDG Position Emission Tomography perform 2 cycle chemotherapy ( PET2 ) experimental arm help stratify patient order restrict BEACOPPesc therapy continuation patient achieve partial response 2 BEACOPPesc regimen allow conventional dose ABVD chemotherapy strategy PET2 negative patient . For patient included trial achievement good response induction treatment check four cycle induction treatment include centrally review PET assessment Patients randomize verification eligibility start protocol treatment.Patients randomly assign standard treatment arm monitor early PET , experimental treatment arm driven PET2 result .</brief_summary>
