	<brief_summary>Brief Summary : The specific aim study : 1 . To test , two-arm randomize controlled trial , efficacy cognitive processing therapy sexual risk posttraumatic symptom severity reduction ( CPT-SR ) HIV-uninfected men sex men ( MSM ) histories childhood sexual abuse ( CSA ) . The primary outcome reduction unprotected anal/vaginal intercourse ( number proportion ) serodiscordant partner . The investigator also examine intervention effect CSA-related trauma symptom severity cognition behavior . 2 . To examine degree intervention-related reduction sexual risk behavior mediate reduction CSA-related symptom severity , cognition , behavior . 3 . To examine degree intervention reduces incident sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) study period , well explore additional potential moderator mediator intervention efficacy . Study hypotheses : 1 . For primary outcome , investigator hypothesize receive intervention reduce transmission-risk behavior . 2 .

	<detailed_description>The prevalence HIV among men sex men ( MSM ) estimate alarm 19 % domestically ( CDC 2010 ) , rate comparable endemic setting certain region sub-Saharan Africa approximately 20 % adult population HIV infect . Studies also demonstrate staggeringly high prevalence childhood sexual abuse ( CSA ) MSM , show association CSA HIV risk MSM . A successful intervention MSM CSA history prevent HIV potential avert infection among risky member HIV vulnerable group U.S . Notwithstanding ability exist HIV prevention intervention show reduction sexual risk taking , recent success chemoprophylaxis , current policy initiative , empirically support recommendation , support development combination prevention intervention specify multiple prevention target , address relate risk factor barrier , ground community context . The pathway CSA adult sexual risk behavior vary complex complexity appropriately address individual-based intervention empirically support intervention CSA relate trauma efficacy test . The development integrate prevention intervention utilize cognitive behavioral technology address co-occurring interfere CSA sexual risk represent novel largely untested innovative application theoretically design address sexual risk directly indirectly reductions CSA-related trauma symptom . The flexibility integrate combination prevention program potential support triage MSM particular risk profile program best meet prevention need . This two-arm RCT design test efficacy psycho-social intervention address intersect epidemic among MSM , HIV CSA . The experimental condition integrate sexual risk reduction counsel Cognitive Processing Therapy Sexual Risk ( CPT-SR ) . CPT-SR specifically pilot MSM CSA histories sexual risk reduce interfere negative CSA-related thought self , accurately appraise sexual risk , decrease avoidance sexual safety consideration rehearsals sexual safety behavior . The active time-matched comparison condition risk reduction counsel plus supportive psychotherapy . The investigator randomize HIV-uninfected MSM report history CSA multiple recent sexual risk episode HIV ( unprotected anal/vaginal intercourse ) across two site ( Boston Miami ) . The primary outcome self-reported sexual risk take assessed via computer-based questionnaire . Secondary outcome include trauma symptom severity , cognitive behavioral . Study assessment point baseline , 3 ( post treatment ) , 6 , 9 , 12-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
