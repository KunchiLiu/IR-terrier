	<brief_summary>Altered choline phospholipid metabolism recently recognize hallmark cancer potential diagnostic therapeutic target number cancer , include hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The feasibility detect HCC basis measure phosphorylation rate choline in-vivo show use positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) investigational tracer compound [ 18F ] fluorocholine ( FCH ) . This Phase 2 study evaluate diagnostic performance FCH PET/CT patient undergo surgical resection treatment HCC . Since molecular signal alteration lead enhanced choline metabolism tumor fully elucidate time , study also collect frozen tissue specimens whole-genome gene expression profile elucidate gene signal transduction pathway relate altered choline metabolism HCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eighty ( 80 ) human subject hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) meet selection criterion undergo PET/CT image 18F-fluoromethylcholine ( FCH 18F-choline ) prior surgical hepatic resection . The PET/CT measure dynamic tissue delivery uptake 18F-choline liver , well static distribution organ fixed period time . Kinetic modeling perform use PET/CT data quantify parameter related 18F-choline delivery , uptake , phosphorylation . The imaging finding compare histopathologic diagnosis follow surgery estimate detection rate diagnostic parameter PET/CT HCC . Tumor liver tissue sample also obtain follow surgery gene expression analysis . These result correlate imaging finding . The surgical procedure clinically warrant consider part investigation .</detailed_description>
