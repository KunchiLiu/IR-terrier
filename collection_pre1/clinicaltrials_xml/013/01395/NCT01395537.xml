	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Since lapatinib inhibits EGFR HER2 receptor , attractive agent treatment esophageal GEJ tumor . PURPOSE : Lapatinib currently approve HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer combination capecitabine letrozole . It hop give lapatinib carboplatin paclitaxel together , combined effect slow stop cancer cell grow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib With Carboplatin Paclitaxel Esophagus Gastroesophageal Junction ( GEJ )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : 1 . Phase I : To assess toxicity feasibility addition lapatinib carboplatin paclitaxel patient recurrent/metastatic adenocarcinoma esophagus gastroesophageal junction . 2 . Phase II : To assess response rate regimen . OUTLINE : 1 . There initial phase I safety cohort study require 12 patient , follow phase II cohort use lapatinib dose define phase I. Carboplatin paclitaxel dos escalate . The initial dose lapatinib 750 mg daily mouth give 6 patient . There dose escalation lapatinib 1000 mg daily . The lapatinib dose phase II cohort trial base toxicity experience first cycle ( 3 week ) treatment . 2 . Phase II : Once optimal lapatinib dose choose , remain patient initiate treatment dose level . Patients stable respond disease 6 cycle continue treatment lapatinib alone progression disease intolerable side effect . Feasibility , toxicity response rate combination assess . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 43 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
