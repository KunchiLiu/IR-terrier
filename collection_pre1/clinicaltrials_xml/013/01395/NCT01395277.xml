	<brief_summary>Groups naturally occur compound call flavonoid find food fruit vegetable , red wine , tea , dark chocolate cocoa product . Diets rich flavonoid associate decreased risk cardiovascular disease major cardiovascular event ( i.e . myocardial infarction ) show improve blood pressure , insulin sensitivity , vascular function variety population ( Type II diabetes , elderly , smoker , etc. ) . The presumed beneficial effect compound think act inherent ability scavenge free radical . Specifically flavonoids scavenge superoxide anion free radical react nitric oxide ( NO ) produce peroxynitrite . The formation peroxynitrite ultimately reduce bioavailability NO essential vasodilation thus vascular health function . Normal age associate impaired endothelial function , presumably due less optimal level NO bioavailability . Therefore , intervention increase NO bioavailability would expect improve microvascular function vascular health population . The purpose study investigate effect dietary flavonoid supplementation vasodilatory capacity cutaneous vasculature , well cerebral vascular reactivity arterial stiffness young old human . This study test hypothesis acute dietary flavonoid treatment improve impaired cutaneous vasodilatory capacity , cerebral vasomotor reactivity , reduce arterial stiffness old young human .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Role nitric oxide vascular function . Nitric oxide ( NO ) important signal molecule involve many physiological process . Of particular interest role endothelial function blood flow regulation . In response heat sheer stress wall blood vessel , endothelial layer blood vessel release NO , cause smooth muscle vessel wall relax vessel dilate . Environmental heat-stress lead increase skin blood flow allow improve heat loss body surface environment , rely NO . Normal age reduce NO bioavailability lead impaired ability increase skin blood flow response environmental heat-stress . Additionally , cerebral blood flow reduce arterial stiffness increase normal age process least partially attributed reduction NO bioavailability . Effects dietary flavonoid . As previously mention Flavonoids group natural compound found vegetable , fruit , wine , tea , cocoa . Flavanols subfamily flavonoid , quantitatively important compound flavonoid family western diet . Flavanol intake show improve vascular health , well increase insulin sensitivity , decrease blood pressure , reduce platelet aggregation , enhance cerebral blood flow . The basic chemical feature flavanol allow act classic antioxidant scavenge free-radicals decrease oxidant level cell . High level free radical , especially superoxide , reduce bioavailability NO thus NO-mediated action . Cocoa cocoa product potent source flavanols , therefore use extensively dietary intervention study effect flavanol supplementation various disease state . Impairments vascular health normal age process . The ability increase skin blood flow response environmental heat-stress lose normal aging , especially individual exceed 65 year age . An attenuated skin blood flow response exposure environmental heat stress would place old individual increase risk heat-related illness death . The ability raise skin blood flow rise skin temperature demonstrate large nitric oxide component , deficit NO bioavailability , also consistently observe age population , could presumably lead attenuated skin blood flow response heat stress . Furthermore , well documented cerebral blood flow reduce arterial stiffness increase normal age process . In regard reduction NO age population , flavanol supplementation show decrease production free radical , scavenge reduce NO level thereby improve index vascular health include flow mediate vasodilation . Therefore , flavanol supplementation may maintain NO bioavailability optimal level , provide feasible way age population maintain vascular health prevent heat-related illness death . Significance : This study address mechanism impair cutaneous cerebral blood flow well increased arterial stiffness occur age population . Furthermore , hypothesis correct , finding study provide evidence efficacy flavanols use ( simple safe lifestyle intervention ) reverse combat impair vascular function commonly occur old individual .</detailed_description>
