	<brief_summary>Migraine one common neurological disorder , affect 12 % general population , remain relatively under-diagnosed under-treated . Migraine wide socioeconomic impact bring large economic burden ; estimate suggest disability due migraine cost &gt; â‚¬27 billion per annum across Europe . Despite prevalence impact , migraine pathophysiology poorly understood . A wider understand functional change disorder would beneficial diagnosis treatment . Saccades rapid eye movement make move eye new object visual field . Reaction time study use investigate Huntington 's disease Parkinson 's disease great success . These use saccadic task ( monitor eye movement ) . Even rest make approximately three saccade per second , lot data quickly gather non-invasive testing . We hope understand underlying mechanism migraine study reaction time migraine patient . Our previous pilot study , less stringent inclusion exclusion criterion , look few patient ( 32 migraineurs 32 control ) , find migraineurs show significantly different saccadic pattern non-migraineurs . This study firstly seek corroborate saccadometric finding earlier pilot study group migraineurs , secondly explore specificity finding migraine also study patient another primary headache syndrome , namely cluster headache . Migraine known dynamic disorder , previous study show longitudinal change migraine brain . To explore hope record longitudinally ( Every day 21 day ) small subset migraineurs identify potential longitudinal change saccadic reaction time . Because portability equipment could do subject home preferred .</brief_summary>
