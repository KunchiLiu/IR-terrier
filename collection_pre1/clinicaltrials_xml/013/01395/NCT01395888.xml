	<brief_title>A Study Compare Impact Fulticasone Furoate/Vilanterol vs. Tiotropium Arterial Stiffness COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase IIIb comparator , double-blind , double-dummy , randomise ( 1:1 ) , parallel group , multi-centre study . At Visit 1 ( Screening Visit ) , subject meet pre-defined Inclusion Criteria none Exclusion Criteria enter 2-week , single-blind placebo Run-in Period . The purpose Run-In Period monitor albuterol/salbutamol use baseline , ensure subject ' COPD stable stage randomization . Subject 's adherence study procedure , diary completion also evaluate Run-In Period . At end Run-in period , subject assess meet randomisation criterion receive one follow two double-blind treatment 12 week : - FF ( 100 mcg ) /VI ( 25 mcg ) administer QD via NDPI morning - Tiotropium ( 18 mcg ) administer QD via HandiHaler morning To ensure blind treatment ensure double-dummy design match NDPI HandiHaler utilise . Each subject instruct self administer blind study drug double blind treatment period follow : - Each morning take 1 inhalation NDPI contain FF ( 100 mcg ) /VI ( 25 mcg ) follow 1 inhalation placebo capsule deliver via HandiHaler . - Each morning take 1 inhalation match placebo NDPI follow 1 inhalation capsule contain tiotropium 18 mcg deliver via HandiHaler . An inhaled short act beta2-receptor agonist , salbutamol/albuterol provide subject use need throughout Run-in Treatment period relief COPD symptom . Ipratropium bromide permit subject stable dose Screening ( Visit 1 ) remain stable dose throughout study . Subjects experience exacerbation COPD ( require medication addition increase rescue medication ) low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) run-in period eligible enter treatment period . Any subject experience similar COPD exacerbation ( sec 4.4 ) LRTI time therapy withdrawn study . The aPWV measure Screening clinic Visits 3-5 . Disease specific health status evaluate use St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ-C ) , Euro Qol Questionnaire ( EQ-5D ) COPD patient COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) Visit 2 ( Day 1 ) Visit 5 ( Weeks 12 ) . The 12-lead ECG evaluate Visit 1 ( Screening ) . Vital sign ( blood pressure pulse rate ) , spirometry measurement , clinical laboratory test ( hematology chemistry ) study-specific safety assessment obtain select clinic visit . A follow-up phone call occur approximately 7 day last clinic visit . The overall study duration Screening Follow-up subject approximately 15 week . Subjects consider complete study upon completion assessment procedures include completion Follow-up Phone Contact ( 7 Â± 2 day post Visit 5 ) .</detailed_description>
