	<brief_summary>Tinnitus , commonly refer `` ring ear '' , affect 50 million people United States recognize major public health concern . Tinnitus frequent cause service-connected disability claim among war veteran . Tinnitus remain subjectively diagnosed entity . There standardized objective method diagnose tinnitus describe functional impact condition . Currently , physicians rely patient-based self report . Without objective method diagnose tinnitus describe functional implication , adequate treatment delivery also hamper since way objectively stratify patient severity group assess response treatment . Because tinnitus know negatively affect cognition ventral attention network prefrontal cortex , measure cognitive processing speed possible way objectively measure tinnitus . This study build previous work investigator do utilized quick , easily accessible measure auditory processing speed . That early study show correlation measure self report measure tinnitus severity , study attempt determine precise estimate correlation . It also well validates result include traditional neurocognitive measuring cognitive speed control presence depression somatoform disorder .</brief_summary>
