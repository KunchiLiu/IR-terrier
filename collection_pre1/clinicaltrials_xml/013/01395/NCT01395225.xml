	<brief_title>Lymph Node Processing Protocol Radical Cystectomy Pelvic Lymph Node Dissection Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE : This research aim compare clinical significance use fat emulsify protocol versus current standard processing lymph node specimens follow radical cystectomy pelvic lymph node dissection . HYPOTHESIS : The investigator hypothesize use fat-emulsifying protocol processing lymph node harvest time radical cystectomy increase proportion patient find lymph node metastasis compare current standard technique . JUSTIFICATION : The mainstay management muscle invasive bladder cancer radical cystectomy pelvic lymph node dissection ( PLND ) . Despite optimal multimodal therapy , approximately half patient invasive bladder cancer die disease . Efforts improve patient outcome focus two principle factor : delivery pre-operative chemotherapy adequacy PLND . While PLND ultimately define anatomic extent , popular surrogate measure extent number lymph node remove . Beyond assess adequacy PLND sense quality care , accurate determination lymph node involvement essential correct stag patient , use guide adjuvant therapy determine patient prognosis . The processing analysis lymph node specimens therefore critical multiple way . The current convention Vancouver General Hospital specimen handle involves dissection nodal specimen laboratory technologist pathology lab . Only palpable node process section remain fat tissue discard . The nodal count determine pathologist review slide base combination macroscopic microscopic examination . This process highly subjective , depend diligence technologist 's dissection , limit final examination palpable node . In fat emulsifying technique , fat dissolve pathologist visualize process node . The investigator believe may provide standardize reproducible method processing lymph node . A standardized reproducible method processing lymph node prerequisite use lymph node count measure quality PLND . And , necessary allow comparison result center . Furthermore , standardize methodology essential ensure adequate sample lymph node clinical stag prognostication . OBJECTIVES : The investigator design prospective trial compare current protocol processing pelvic lymph node radical cystectomy PLND fat-emulsifying protocol . The investigator aim answer three question trial : . While fat-emulsifying technique almost certainly identify node current technique manual dissection , likely identify nodal metastasis , aim study determine whether careful analysis find great proportion patient lymph node metastasis . This translate well stag prognostication . ii . The current technique likely miss particularly small lymph node easily palpate . The investigator hypothesize threshold lymph node size risk metastasis negligible , identification small node therefore clinically meaningful . iii . The investigator hypothesize fat-emulsifying protocol remove much variability due human element manual dissection prosector . While investigator test hypothesis directly , investigator believe methodology photographic documentation result reflect degree objectivity methodology see technique . The ultimate goal research proposal develop standardize reproducible technique use everywhere order enhance care patient invasive bladder cancer . RESEARCH METHOD : Patients : All patient undergo radical cystectomy pelvic lymph node dissection Vancouver General Hospital ( VGH ) invite participate prospective study . Patients clinical stage T1-4 , N0 , M0 bladder cancer invite participate study enrol informed consent obtain . Surgical technique : The extent lymph node dissection define either conventional ( bifurcation common iliac artery ) extend ( least aortic bifurcation ) determine surgeon case-by-case basis . Dissection pre-sacral lymph node also surgeon . Objective documentation extent node dissection assure intra-operative photography every case . Pathologic process PLND specimen : Each specimen analyze conventional mean fat-emulsifying protocol . The current convention Vancouver General Hospital specimen handle describe . In study pathologist count number node dissect prosector accord current protocol . The tissue remain removal grossly palpable lymph node submit process fat-emulsifying protocol , identical LNRS ( `` lymph node remove solution '' ) protocol define Koren et al . This consist placement entire specimen specialize solution 12 hour . The solution mixture 95 % ethanol , diethyl ether , glacial acetic acid buffer formalin ratio volume 6.5:2:0.5:1 Specimens treat photographed objective documentation nodal count . The additional node embed paraffin , section 2 mm interval , stain eosin hematoxylin . The total number node , size presence metastasis record . Data collection : Demographic , clinical pathological information record prospectively . Demographic variable analyze include : age , sex , weight , height race . Clinical variable include : date cancer diagnosis , clinical pathologic stage diagnosis time surgery ( TNM stag ) , date radical cystectomy , history intravesical chemotherapy , medical co-morbidities prior abdominal surgery , extent lymph node dissection , complication procedure . Pathological variable record finding conventional fat-emulsifying protocol . The number , size presence metastasis node find record . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Outcome measure : The primary outcome proportion patient find lymph node metastasis pathologic examination . Specifically , difference proportion specimens find contain nodal metastases use fat-emulsifying protocol compare conventional lymph node processing analyze . Secondary outcome measure : total number lymph node total number lymph node metastasis count technique relationship size lymph node presence metastatic carcinoma . Sample size calculation : An increase identification nodal metastases 15 % ( fat-emulsifying compare conventional processing ) consider clinically significant . The current rate node positivity time radical cystectomy PLND VGH 28 % , increase 43 % would deem clinically relevant . To detect difference power ( 1-β ) 80 % α error 10 % , 125 patient need enrol arm study . Analysis Data : Data analyze use SPSS software . The independent sample t-test use compare result lymph node analysis process conventional mean versus node process use fat-emulsifying protocol ( p &lt; 0.5 ) . The relationship size presence metastatic disease do linear regression model ( p &lt; 0.5 ) . A significant difference group define p &lt; 0.05 . A biostatistician ( Robert Bell ) Vancouver Prostate Centre assist data analysis . SUMMARY The investigator opportunity simple inexpensive technical processing measure enhance integral component clinical risk stratification patient invasive bladder cancer . The investigator establish solid foundation pelvic lymph node count upon clinical concept lymph node yield density validate . The investigator expect demonstrate fat-emulsifying protocol easy adopt , reproducible suitable widespread use . It potential impact every patient undergo radical cystectomy PLND .</detailed_description>
