	<brief_summary>Parent study : A Coordinated Approach Cancer Health ( CATCH ) , design compare efficacy two intervention arm ( describe ) intend increase breast , cervical , colon cancer screen rate among patient serve community health center . A central focus CATCH evaluate sustainable strategy maximize cancer screen rate among population face significant cancer disparity . CATCH conduct partnership large health clinic Massachusetts , serve largely Hispanic low income population . Focusing use Interactive Voice Response ( IVR ) telephone technology system , study examine extent IVR , develop culturally sensitive appropriate manner ( focus group conduct inform intervention ) , improve breast , cervical colon cancer screen rate compare control group . Furthermore , plan determine pair IVR telephone call prevention care coordinator ( PCC ) result high screening rate ( compare IVR group ) . We determine cost-effectiveness IVR alone vs. IVR + PCC . Substudy : We conduct substudy parent study , look comparison return rate two colorectal cancer screen home test kit : Fecal Occult Bood Tests ( gFOBTs ) Fecal Immunochemical Tests ( FITs ) .

	<detailed_description>For substudy , study objective : Determine difference completion home blood stool test kit type home test employ Fecal Occult Blood Test ( gFOBT ) vs. Fecal Immunochemical Test ( FIT ) , determine predictor test completion . Substudy methods/design/arms/eligibility : All patient pick home blood stool test kit 6-12 month study recruitment time period randomize receive either gFOBT FIT kit . Randomization occur month . Medical assistant ( MAs ) hand kit . Participants pick kit ( either gFOBT FIT ) give study information card briefly describe study study opt phone number . If patient call opt , card let patient know he/she would contact via telephone complete brief survey , give small incentive upon completion . A bilingual member study staff telephone individual , opt , pick home blood stool test kit study period . Four six week post kit pickup , staff determine patient return complete test clinic ( yes vs. ) examine electronic medical record .
