	<brief_title>OPTImal CArdiac REhabilitation ( OPTICARE ) Following Acute Coronary Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Throughout western world , healthy life style management become increasingly important . Therefore , secondary prevention emphasis lifestyle adjustment cornerstone modern cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) . This study may demonstrate benefit extend CR respect achieve optimal long term secondary prevention goal . Objective : The objective investigate whether acute coronary syndrome patient cardiac risk profile improve 2 new extend cardiac rehabilitation intervention ( OPTICARE COACH ) patient maintain healthy life style habit active life style compare patient randomized standard CR . Study design : The propose trial singlecenter , multi-disciplinary randomize controlled trial 18-month follow-up . In total 900 patient randomize 3 arm : ( 1 ) Standard CR accord Dutch guideline ; ( 2 ) OPTICARE intervention : standard CR participation multifactorial lifestyle session rehabilitation additional session 4 , 6 12 month personalize program promote active lifestyle ; ( 3 ) COACH intervention : standard CR accord Dutch guideline follow 5 telephone deliver coaching session start 6 week interval ( 6 month ) . The enrollment period 24 month , intervention period 12 month duration follow-up another 6 month . Assessments take place 4 time point : baseline , 12 week inclusion ( end standard CR ) , 12 18 month . Study population : Patients refer standard CR include participate trial . ACS patient treat primary elective PCI CABG , stable medical condition provide write informed consent eligible participate . Intervention : OPTICARE intervention : Standard CR obligation participate multifactorial lifestyle risk factor session ( medical information , dietary advises , risk factor emotional advises ) . Individual session personalize home-based program promote active life style upon instruction physiotherapist physical activity counsellor completion rehabilitation . If applicable , patient participate smoke cessation , dietary stress management program . Additional supervise multifactorial lifestyle risk management training session 2 hour provide 4 , 6 12 month . COACH intervention : standard CR accord Dutch guideline follow 5 telephone base coaching session start 6 week interval 6 month . The coaching session include assertiveness training , goal set reassessment . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main objective investigate whether patient randomize extended CR ( OPTICARE COACH ) cardiac risk profile improve , patient maintain healthy life style habit achieve increase daily activity level compare patient randomized standard CR . Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP ) OPTICARE study Introduction The propose trial single center , multi-disciplinary open-label randomize controlled trial . Between October 2011 August 2014 922 patient randomize 3 arm : ( 1 ) Standard CR accord Dutch guideline ( Opticare-Basic ) ( n=308 ) ; ( 2 ) OPTICARE intervention : standard CR addition personalize program promote active lifestyle . Besides , additional session offer 4 , 6 12 month improve long-term adherence lifestyle change . ( Opticare-Capri ) ( n=310 ) ; ( 3 ) Heart COACH intervention : standard CR accord Dutch guideline follow 5-6 telephone deliver coaching session start one finish standard CR 6 week interval 12 month ( Opticare-Achmea Heart Coach ) ( n=304 ) . The intervention period 12 month duration follow-up another 6 month . Assessments take place 4 time point : baseline , 12 week inclusion ( end standard CR ) , 12 18 month . Current status The study finish January 2016 . During September 2015 January 2016 data check clean . In February 2016 database close statistical analysis start . Statistical analysis plan Cardiology Primary end point sample size Primary end point SCORE risk function measure 18 month post randomization ( Conroy RM et al , Eur HJ 2003 ; 24:987-1003 ) . This score estimate 10-year risk fatal cardiovascular disease . The SCORE risk function include age , gender , systolic blood pressure , total cholesterol smoke behaviour . The RESPONSE trial ( Jorstadt HT , Heart 2013 ; 99:1421-1430 ) study effectiveness nurse-coordinated outpatient risk management program cardiac patient . That strategy associate 17 % reduction SCORE Risk function compare standard care . Based data , take account intensive intervention perform , expect OPTICARE-CAPRI OPTICARECOACH arm least 20 % reduction SCORE Risk Score 1.5 year : 5.40 4.32 point estimate standard deviation ( SD ) 4.5 . With 274 patient treatment arm , study 80 % power ( beta-error=0.02 ) detect difference alpha-error 0.05 ( 2-sided test ) . We enroll total 300 patient treatment arm , take account 10 % drop-out rate . N.B . In analysis Opticare-Capri compare Opticare-Basic Opticare-Heart Coach Opticare-Basic . The sample size computation Opticare-Capri compare Opticare-Heart Coach . Primary analysis : intention-to-treat In total , three analysis perform investigate consistency different analysis investigate whether difference method explain . Although accord protocol , comparison make cardiac event , event ( mortality , myocardial infarction , coronary revascularizations rehospitalizations cardiac reason ) collect . To investigate : RISC score normally distribute ? If necessary , ( ln- ) transfrmation apply . Analysis 1 ( main analysis ) : SCORE risk function score 18 month Opticare-Capri vs Opticare-Basic ( student 's t-test ) Opticare-Capri vs Opticare-Basic . Analyse 2 : Mixed model use . These model take account miss data miss random ( Twisk , 2004 ) . This analysis include patient least one measurement . All 4 time point include model ( repeat measurement ) . At way optimally analyze change time . Analyse 3 : Delta score 18 month vs baseline . All patient score baseline 18 month include . Secondary analysis : per protocol Patients attend least 75 % rehabilitation session include per protocol analysis , mean 18 training session . Besides , patient include Opticare-Achmea Heart Coach complete least 3 5 telephonic coaching session . Patients OPTICARE-Capri arm invite 3 active lifestyle intervention session 3 multifactorial lifestyle cardiovascular risk factor group intervention session . Only Opticare patient attend least 4 6 possible group session , include per-protocol analysis . It evaluate whether result coincide intention-to-treat result . The analysis describe intention-to-treat analysis perform per protocol analysis result compare result intention-to-treat analysis . In intention-to-treat per protocol analysis also individual risk factor systolic blood pressure , total cholesterol smoke behaviour analyze separately dependent variable . Imputation No imputation perform end point parameter If necessary , multiple imputation miss data baseline characteristic perform . Statistical analysis plan Rehabilitation Medicine Primary end point Primary end point daily amount moderate-to-vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) measure Actigraph ( Bluetooth Â® Smart wGT3X-BT ) . Sample size Expected amount minute ( moderate-intensity ) daily activity 18 month post randomization Opticare-Basic program : 16 minutes/day ( SD 13 ) Based amount minute start rehabilitation ( Ref . Oliveira Stevenson et al ) Opticare-Achmea Heart Coach : 25 minutes/day ( SD 20 ) Based amount minute completion standard CR ( Ref . Stevenson et al ) , expect patient Opticare-Achmea Heart Coach reach ( ? ) level activity Opticare-Capri : 32 minutes/day ( SD 23 ) It expect patient Opticare-Capri reach recommend level physical activity . At 2 year follow-up , Oliveira et al find patient active mean 63.7 minute end counsel session , long term effect unknown . SD base high SD measure Oliveira . With 202 patient treatment arm , study power 80 % ( beta-error=0.02 ) detect difference alpha-error 0.05 , take account ANOVA Bonferroni correction ( 2-sided test ) Taking account miss value , failure measurement system drop out ( 20 % ) , total 245 patient treatment arm enrol . Analyses : per protocol Patients drop study CR program visit center anymore , make impossible install Actigraph device . Therefore , design mix intention-to-treat-analysis identical per-protocol analysis apply . In CONSORT diagram design explain detail . Per-protocol analysis : To investigate : MVPA normally distribute ? If need , ( ln- ) transformation perform . Analysis 1 : MVPA 18 month Opticare-Capri v Opticare COACH v Opticare-Basic ( ANOVA ) . Analysis 2 : Mixed model . These model take account miss data miss random ( Twisk , 2004 ) . This analysis include patient least one measurement . All 4 time point include model ( repeat measurement ) . In way optimally analyze change time . Analysis 3 : Delta minute MVPA 18 month vs baseline . All patient valid measurement baseline 18 month include . N.B . In analysis also minute sedentary behavior distribution MVPA sedentary behavior analyze separately ,</detailed_description>
