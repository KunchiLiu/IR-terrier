	<detailed_description>Considering high diagnostic accuracy less vulnerable stag therapy procedure , SLNB rapidly become state art diagnostic axillary stag early breast cancer . Prior surgery , call sentinel lymph node detect , harvest histopathologically examine . The histopathologic status sentinel node thereby accurately reflect status remain axillary node . The sentinel lymph node biopsy allow minimize risk burden patient likely metastasis axillary lymph node spar ALND reduce risk surgery postoperative lymph oedema instance . Contrarily former procedure axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) do time , ALND follow detect sentinel lymph node metastatic . Routinely sentinel lymph node map use radiocolloid tracer technetium , sometimes combine blue dye . However infrastructure radioactive tracing complex available easily : special technique equipment manufacturing radiocolloid well train use radioisotope need . For example , application radioactive marker need ready access nuclear medicine department , pre-operative visit effective coordination involve disciplinesis . As radioisotope form specialised , rare industry facility availability heavenly dependend lack radioisotope shortages diagnostic procedure already report . Furthermore radiocolloid mapping associate radioactive exposure concern patient health worker impose problem surgical waste disposal . Novel method detect sentinel lymph node waive pre-operative injection radioactive marker currently investigate . One new method application fluorescence marker SLN detection . In clinical trial novel method detect sentinel lymph node use indocyanine green , fluorescent molecule shall investigate .</detailed_description>
