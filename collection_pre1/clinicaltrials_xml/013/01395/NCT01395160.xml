	<detailed_description>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) bipolar disorder ( BD ) affect approximately 2.5 % 1 % , respectively , adult population UK . They represent major clinical economic burden society . Genetic environmental risk factor ( life event BD ) ; identify disorder . Despite highly different symptom presentation ADHD BD , recently become clear share cognitive characteristic , observe high response time variability ( RTV ) . This led question whether increase RTV , reflect short-term fluctuation performance , non-specific marker psychopathology whether cause high RTV could differ across disorder . RTV identify possible early marker psychopathology ; therefore well understand underlying mechanism could lead improved diagnosis prevention negative consequence . Further , give insight comorbidity observe ADHD BD . This study use cognitive-electrophysiological method investigate cause RTV association cognitive neurophysiological impairment observe disorder ( aim 1 ) . The second question address whether , within disorder , current cognitive functioning relate patient ' current social functioning ( aim 2 ) . Adverse life event psychosocial risk factor contribute high variability level social functioning observe , within individual , disorder ; yet understand association current social functioning cognitive functioning limit . Finally study explore cognitive difference detect electrophysiological investigation associate candidate gene marker either disorder ( aim 3 ) .</detailed_description>
