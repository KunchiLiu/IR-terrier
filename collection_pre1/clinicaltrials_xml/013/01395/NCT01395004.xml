	<detailed_description>LCH115397 phase 2a , open label , multicenter study test 125 mg ( start dose ) daily oral GSK2110183 adult adolescent Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis patient . The primary objective study efficacy ( 3 6 month ) safety . For purpose efficacy analysis , patient stratify two group : treatment-naïve ( stratum 1 ) refractory reactivation disease ( stratum 2 ) . Adolescent participation limit patient refractory reactivation disease ( stratum 2 ) .</detailed_description>

Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method define protocol wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . For form HRT , least two four week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test screening period , agree use adequate contraception screen four week last dose study drug . Note : Oral contraceptive reliable due potential drugdrug interaction . 9 . Adequate organsystems function . 1 .
