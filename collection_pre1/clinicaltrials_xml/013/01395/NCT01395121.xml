	<brief_summary>The aim study see drug call nilotinib ( Tasigna® ) effective treatment patient rare group acral mucosal melanoma change ( mutation ) protein call cKIT . Nilotinib interfere signal inside cell mutation believe may lead shrinkage tumour . Acral melanoma find palm sol mucosal melanomas start inside body cavity rather skin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Looking Nilotinib Treat Acral Mucosal Melanoma Skin Cancer That Has Spread</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NICAM two step consent process . Patients diagnose advanced acral mucosal melanoma first consent study registration undergo screen test include test sample melanoma tissue c-KIT mutation . Following confirmation c-KIT mutation , patient ask consent study entry continuation screen . Eligible patient enter study commence take nilotinib tablet twice day long clinical benefit maintain .</detailed_description>
