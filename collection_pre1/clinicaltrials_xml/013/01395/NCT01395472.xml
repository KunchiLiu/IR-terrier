	<detailed_description>It well know benefit physical exercise cognitive functioning , demonstrate animal study healthy human individual type pathology . Nevertheless , study investigate effect acute physical exercise cognitive function people traumatic brain injury , even though frequently impairments several cognitive domain due brain damage . The effect two intensity physical exercise ( moderate exhaustive ) attention , process speed , memory , executive control decision making investigated patient TBI . For matter , performance compare non-brain injured subject submit protocol TBI patient submit stretch session . Each subject submit neuropsychological evaluation physical exercise order determine improvement cognitive performance post-exercise .</detailed_description>
