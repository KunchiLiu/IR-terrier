	<detailed_description>Phonation change follow thyroidectomy report many investigation . They consider multifactorial origin consequence laryngeal nerve injury event thyroidectomy include arytenoid trauma endotracheal intubation , cricothyroid dysfunction , strap muscle malfunction lesion perithyroidal neural plexus , laryngotracheal fixation impairment vertical movement psychological reaction operation . Injury external branch superior laryngeal nerve ( EBSLN ) occur dissection clamp superior thyroid vessel prevalence complication report 0.5 % 58 % . This injury cause complete paralysis cricothyroid muscle result lower fundamental frequency voice worsen voice performance produce high-frequency sound . Intraoperative nerve monitoring ( IONM ) gain widespread acceptance adjunct gold standard visual nerve identification technique use identify recurrent laryngeal nerve ( RLN ) EBSLN . However , remain unclear IONM added-value clinical outcome thyroidectomy term preserve individual voice performance . This study design test hypothesis .</detailed_description>
