	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Stereotactic Radiosurgery Following Surgical Resection Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain metastasis common adult intracranial tumor , occur approximately 10 % 30 % adult cancer patient , represent important cause morbidity mortality population . The risk develop brain metastasis differs different primary tumor histology , lung cancer accounting approximately one half brain metastasis . The prognosis patient brain metastasis poor . The median survival time untreated patient approximately 1 month . With treatment , overall median survival time diagnosis approximately 4 month . The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) recursive partition analysis ( RPA ) describe three prognostic class , define age , Karnofsky Performance Score ( KPS ) , disease status . The widely use treatment patient multiple brain metastasis whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) . The appropriate use WBRT provide rapid attenuation many neurological symptom , improve quality life , extend median survival , especially beneficial patient whose brain metastases surgically inaccessible medical consideration preclude surgery . The use adjuvant WBRT resection stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) proven effective term improve local control brain metastasis , thus , likelihood neurological death decrease . The standard care solitary brain metastasis surgery follow WBRT . In study Patchell et al . solitary brain metastasis status post resection , addition whole brain radiation significantly reduce local recurrence approximately 45 % 10 % resection . Although prolong survival functional independence , treatment regimen show result significantly improve loco-regional control . A recent study European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) randomize patient underwent gross total resection ( GTR ) 3 brain metastasis adjuvant WBRT versus observation . Adjuvant WBRT result significantly reduce intracranial failure neurologic death , however overall survival functionally independent survival different . Among major finding study unacceptably high level local failure occur GTR alone . Local recurrence rate range approximately 45 % 1 year 60 % 2 year resection . However , aside improvement intra-cranial control , well document WBRT associate serious long term side effect , include significant neurocognitive decline . A randomized study conduct Chang et al SRS versus SRS + WBRT 1 - 3 brain metastasis find addition WBRT associate significantly bad memory recall early 4 month . A conclusion study regimen close surveillance SRS necessary prefer SRS + WBRT neurocognitive effect WBRT may actually worse caused intracranial disease recurrence . Many center offer patient SRS cavity resection alone improve local control avoid negative effect WBRT . There several retrospective study use SRS resection cavity alone , 1 year actuarial local control rate range 35 % - 82 % . The radiation necrosis rate study range 2 % - 6 % . In currently unpublished data Emory University review 63 patient 65 cavity treat 01/2007 08/2010 , 1 year actuarial local control rate 78 % . Of 10 local failure , 70 % in-field , 10 % marginal , 20 % . The high rate in-field failure suggest current dose regimen use may insufficient optimal local control . The current SRS dose constraint use derived phase I trial RTOG 90-05 . This study determine maximum tolerate dose SRS previously irradiate patient unresected brain metastasis base lesion size . The maximum dos currently use may artificially low resect patient several reason . First , patient population study previously irradiate likely lower maximum tolerate dose versus non-irradiated population . Secondly , typical plan target volume ( PTV ) resection bed cavity 1 - 2mm margin . This mean vast majority irradiate PTV brain parenchyma , actually cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , result low radiation necrosis rate dose/volume . Currently , high local control rate approximately 80 % , may room improvement increase dose without significantly increase risk radiation necrosis . The investigator propose prospective phase I trial patient status post surgical resection solitary brain metastasis . The purpose trial determine maximum tolerate dose single fraction SRS resection cavity . The investigator believe current SRS dosing constraint may low , large therapeutic window exist patient population . Results trial may form basis future trial directly compare WBRT SRS cavity alone follow resection solitary brain metastasis . This phase III study would answer question whether local irradiation adequate treatment patient follow surgery metastatic brain disease . Also anticipated QOL measure would build study attempt confirm data report Chang WBRT associate significant decline QOL even early endpoint .</detailed_description>
