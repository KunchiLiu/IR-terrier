	<brief_summary>One common occurrence follow open heart surgery irregular rhythm top chamber heart know atrial fibrillation ( afib AF ) . It know 30 % patient bypass surgery without heart valve replace time develop AF . It felt occurrence lead factor affect subject health rest life . In study investigator see post operative afib indicator person afib condition may last post op recovery period many physician feel.The problem question , post operative afib transient indicator long term episode afib may lead health concern like stroke . Fifty subject ask participate . There group 25 subject . All subject device implant skin able detect type heart rhythm . One group get standard treatment physician blind recording . The group treat record information amount time afib . The purpose study determine true occurrence afib first year open heart surgery see know alter clinical management group subjects.Currently subject treat without know information base arrhythmia longer happen heart heal recover surgery . Most medication control heart rate rhythm stop around 3 month . There also tendency use blood thin medication prevention stroke time period . Stroke one major complication afib . Not subject aware irregular heart beat depend accurately know . They might feel episode fast beat episode may become weak fatigue . Weakness fatigue also normal first part recover bypass surgery . By document true episode afib investigator well understand postoperative afib might need treated life long issue rather transient post operative issue . This treatment might change clinical management decrease mortality .</brief_summary>
