	<brief_summary>Patients moderate COPD define GOLD guideline constitute almost 46 % 54 % diagnosed COPD patient . Yet limit data exists characterize study population term drug therapy pattern COPD-related resource use cost . The objective follow study conduct analysis real-world setting ( 1 ) identify characterize COPD patient moderate exacerbation ( 2 ) evaluate impact initiate different maintenance therapy population . Maintenance therapy medication include inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) , long-acting beta agonist ( LABAs ) , combination ICS+LABA , anticholinergic ( ACs ) include tiotropium ( TIO ) ipratropium combination ipratropium-albuterol ( collectively refer ipratropium [ IPR ] ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data January 1 , 2003 March 31 , 2009 available term study period . Patients least one moderate exacerbation define physician/outpatient visit primary diagnosis COPD oral corticosteroid ( OCS ) antibiotic prescription ( ABX ) within 5 day physician/outpatient visit identify target population . The date first moderate exacerbation serve patient 's index date , identify identification period January 1 , 2004 February 28 , 2009 . Furthermore moderate exacerbation first medical claim primary diagnosis COPD ensure patient moderate exacerbation capture . Subsequently , patient categorize study cohort base first maintenance drug prescription ( index drug ) receive 30-day period index date term treatment assessment period . Maintenance drug consider include fluticasone-salmeterol 250/50 mcg ( FSC ) anticholinergic ( AC ) include tiotropium ( TIO ) ipratropium combination ipratropium-albuterol ( collectively refer ipratropium [ IPR ] ) . Patients receive maintenance medication receive maintenance medication consider treatment assessment period exclude . All outcome assess follow-up period vary length 1 day 1 year patient . The variable follow-up period define period start day treatment assessment period , end early follow event date : end study period ( March 31 , 2009 ) , end patient 's continuous eligibility health plan , end patient 's 1-year follow-up , treatment switch date ( ie , switch study medication different index drug ) , discontinuation date index drug ( ie , 60-day gap end day ' supply precede prescription fill date next consecutive prescription ) , occurrence COPD-related exacerbation ( COPD-related hospitalization , ED visit , physician/outpatient visit prescription oral corticosteroid antibiotic within 5 day visit ) . A 1-year period index date ( pre-period ) use provide baseline assessment study cohort . The specific date pre- follow-up period vary patient depend index date . Specifically study hypothesis primary outcome test : Ho : There difference risk COPD-related exacerbation FSC AC cohorts Ha : There difference risk COPD-related exacerbation FSC AC cohorts Hypothesis key secondary outcome COPD-related cost test : Ho : There difference COPD-related cost FSC AC cohorts Ha : There difference COPD-related cost FSC AC cohort</detailed_description>
