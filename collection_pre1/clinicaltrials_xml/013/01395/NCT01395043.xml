	<brief_summary>Major abdominal surgery associate postoperative pain . Transversus Abdominis Plane ( TAP ) block show reduce pain opioid-requirements abdominal surgery . However single block short effect 12 hour depend type local-anesthetics use . With study wish investigate possibility place TAP-catheter order prolong effect TAP-block give repeatedly bolus-injections TAP catheter study pain opioid requirement patient undergo elective colon-resection give TAP-catheter preoperatively . Our hypothesis practical technical possible place bilateral TAP-catheters pre-operatively pain opioid-requirements low .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transversus Abdominis Plane Catheter : Study Method</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative pain major challenge work anesthesia . Epidural catheter golden standard postoperative pain management major abdominal surgery . However number patient absolute relative contraindication placement epidural catheter . It therefore necessary find good alternative epidural catheter . Transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block show provide analgesia abdominal wall reduce opioid-requirements pain abdominal surgery . However effect TAP block limit time efficacy local analgesic use . Placing TAP-catheter order prolong effect TAP-block repeatedly bolus-injections TAP-catheters sporadically describe far never investigate systematic way . We investigate practical technical possibility place bilateral ultrasound-guided TAP-catheters pre-operatively patient undergo elective colon-resection . Further evaluate pain opioid-requirement postoperatively .</detailed_description>
