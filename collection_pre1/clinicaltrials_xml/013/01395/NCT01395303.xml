	<brief_title>Polymorphisms Vitamin D System Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D , essential calcium metabolism , produce skin sun exposure obtain food , mainly fatty fish vitamin D supplement . For activation vitamin D must hydroxylated liver 25 ( OH ) D thereafter kidney 1,25 ( OH ) 2D . In circulation 25 ( OH ) D 1,25 ( OH ) 2D bound carrier protein ( DBP ) , 1,25 ( OH ) 2D exert effect bind vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) . The serum level 25 ( OH ) D , metabolite use evaluate person 's vitamin D status , part genetically determine several polymorphism effect serum 25 ( OH ) D identify . These polymorphism , minor allele frequency vary 16 40 % , appear important serum 25 ( OH ) D level effect season , physical activity vitamin D supplementation . Vitamin D vital skeleton , appear related number health outcome , include mortality previously demonstrate Tromsø study . However , serum level 25 ( OH ) D strongly influence life-style factor also relate health outcome , difficult decide whether relation vitamin D health causal . On hand , polymorphism influence life-style , effect polymorphisms life-long . Accordingly , may better marker vitamin D status single serum 25 ( OH ) D measurement . Furthermore , number polymorphism regard vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) may associate health . In present study therefore relate polymorphism affect serum 25 ( OH ) D level function VDR , anthropometric biochemical measure , mortality , diseases risk factor disease . DNA obtain 4th Tromsø study . If find expected association polymorphisms disease , strengthen role vitamin D human health , may important recommendation regard vitamin D supplementation . Considering high prevalence vitamin D deficiency world wide , may potentially huge consequence public health . The main purpose present study vitamin D system , Tromsø study previously also find number association thyroid androgen function health . Obtaining DNA analysis major cost project , whereas analysis individual polymorphism relatively cheap . We therefore also include polymorphism regard thyroid androgen function .</detailed_description>
