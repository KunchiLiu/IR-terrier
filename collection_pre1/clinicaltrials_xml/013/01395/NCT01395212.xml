	<brief_summary>The MYSTAR-5-YEAR study control patient 5 year treatment combine ( intramyocardial intracoronary ) delivery autologous BM-MNCs . The clinical endpoint prospective non-randomized observational study MACCE , define major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event . Patients investigated echocardiography , SPECT MRI . 2D ( NOGA-guided SPECT ) 3D ( NOGA-guided MRI ) image refine evaluation exact analysis intramyocardial inject area ( ROI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MYSTAR-5-YEAR : Long-term Follow-up Patients With Ischemic Heart Disease Treated With Cell Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Based available long-term result cardiac stem cell therapy , seem , offer short-term moderate benefit , long-term outcome still matter debate . In 2008 , Austrian arm MYSTAR study ( prospective multi-center single-blind trial ) include patient recent AMI treat combined ( intramyocardial intracoronary ) delivery autologous BM-MNCs complete 1-year FUP . The MYSTAR result show moderate significant improvement infarct size LV function similar trial , confirm safety , feasibility efficacy BMC treatment AMI patient . The patient enrol study reach 5 8 year FUP 2011 , raise question whether combined delivery autologous BM-MNCs result long-term benefit patient . Aim study : To investigate long-term , 5 year clinical outcome patient enrol MYSTAR study . Study design : Prospective non-randomized single-center Austrian long-term FUP registry . Study patient : A total 60 patient previous cardiac stem cell therapy ( participate MYSTAR study ) include present study Primary endpoint : occurrence MACCE ( major adverse cardiac cerebrovascular event , include all-cause death , re-AMI , revascularization stroke ) mean 5 year follow-up . Secondary endpoint : improvement clinical symptom , express CCS NYHA score , change global LV EF , measure echocardiography , size infarction determine stress-rest SPECT , LV RV volume , function cardiac output measure cardiac MRI .</detailed_description>
