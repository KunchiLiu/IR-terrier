	<brief_title>Effects Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty Aqueous Humor Dynamics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Describe background study . Include critical evaluation exist knowledge , specifically identify information gap project intend fill . Laser trabeculoplasty currently well establish treatment option lower intraocular pressure management open angle glaucoma1,2 . The procedure involve placement laser spot trabecular meshwork , possibly variety laser type . ALT widely utilized option laser trabeculoplasty past decade . Since availability approximately decade ago , SLT currently additional option laser trabeculoplasty . 3,4 . Current evidence suggest SLT achieve IOP lower effect without thermal damage trabecular meshwork5 . The IOP lower effect SLT show comparable ALT long term6 . In physiological term , ALT show low IOP primarily increase conventional outflow facility7 . There two putative mechanism may facilitated8 . Thermal coagulation shrinkage ALT may mechanically open adjacent trabecular meshwork Schlemm 's canal . Alternatively delivery laser energy may trigger biological process activation matrix metalloproteinases microenvironment trabecular meshwork lead remodel tissue result improved outflow facility . ALT use argon another thermal laser photocoagulate tissue around trabecular meshwork . The setting vary depend tissue response pigmentation . Most clinician use 600-1500mW , 50-100 spot , 50 micron spot size 0.1 sec duration . Also , limit data fluorophotometric tonographic study ALT none SLT best knowledge . All available reference know investigator include list reference . The effect SLT aqueous humor dynamic currently unknown . Given lack demonstrable thermal damage histopathologic examination5 , unlikely effect SLT could mechanically mediate . There suggestion potential interaction IOP lower effect prostaglandin SLT use together9,10 . This suggest could possible share mechanisms SLT prostaglandin . The IOP lower effect SLT may mediate part effect uveoscleral pathway addition trabecular outflow pathway . This study determine change aqueous humor dynamic produce SLT lead IOP lower effect . SLT Q switch frequency double Nd : YAG laser . The duration 3 nanosecond spot size 500 micron . Power varies 0.5-1.5 mJ total number spot 50-over 100 . The mechanism action may disruption melanosomes , unequivocally prove yet .</detailed_description>
