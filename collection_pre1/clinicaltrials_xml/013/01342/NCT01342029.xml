	<brief_summary>This research study design test use ranolazine patient angina ( chest discomfort due reduce blood supply heart ) due microvascular coronary dysfunction ( MCD ; abnormality small blood vessel heart ) . This drug approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment chronic angina . The FDA approve drug base study primarily patient chronic angina major blockage artery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blinded , placebo- control , cross-over clinical trial . 147 subject enrol two clinical site , project 9-10 % dropout anticipate 134 complete subject . To maintain blinding investigator , study randomization table keep Pharmacy Service . The sponsor ship study drug directly Pharmacy Service . The pharmacy service also responsible disperse study drug . There 4 study visit ( 2 visit study period ) study . Subjects study 6 week Week 0 - baseline visit Week 6 - exit visit . Besides procedure study medication mention , study procedure include informed consent , physical exam , questionnaire , EKG safety assessment , blood collection laboratory testing , cardiac MRI , follow-up event . In sum , participant ask undergo 2 cardiac MRI 's fill questionnaires 4 time . They ask participate 6 week two 2-week course ( treatment window period 5 day ) , one ranolazine placebo ( without know take ) . There 2-week washout period treatment . The participant otherwise remain usual medication . The physician also blind medication subject receiving . Participation study approximately 6 week , consist two 2-week study period 2-week washout period : 1 . During first 2-week period : Subjects randomize first receive either ranolazine placebo pill ( sugar pill active medicine ) . Subjects take extended-release ranolazine placebo pill total 2 week . Subjects take 500 mg twice daily first 1 week 1000 mg twice daily additional 1 week . Subjects unable take high dose due side effect remain 500 mg twice daily entire study period . After 2 week , participant Cardiac MRI complete study questionnaire . These tool allow u evaluate participant good medication . 2 . 2-week washout period : Subject ask go 2 week without study medication ( ranolazine placebo ) . 3 . During second 2-week period : Subject give either extended release ranolazine placebo depend receive first time total 2 week . Subjects take 500 mg twice daily first 1 week 1000 mg twice daily additional 1 week . Subjects unable take high dose due side effect remain 500 mg twice daily entire study period . This 2-week period follow final Cardiac MRI questionnaire completion .</detailed_description>
