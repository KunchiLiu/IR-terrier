	<brief_summary>Since introduction propofol routine anesthesia practice , phenomenon pain injection plague anesthesia provider . Propofol , unstable phenol , trigger release bradykinin injection . This release cause painful burn sensation patient site injection . Anesthesia provider attempt large number remedy prevent pain injection . Previously explore idea include inject propofol large vein , warm hand hot pack , intravenous pretreatment numerous medication . Currently , pretreatment lidocaine commonly administer prevent propofol injection pain . No study date look combination lidocaine magnesium single syringe pretreatment pain injection cause propofol . In addition , administration protocol study thus far mirror clinical practice University Wisconsin . The investigator propose study use magnesium lidocaine single syringe pretreatment propofol relate pain injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Magnesium Lidocaine Pretreatment Pain That Caused Injection Propofol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve little change typical induction general anesthesia . Considering lidocaine routinely use induction anesthesia , anesthesia staff also inject magnesium prior propofol , little variation induction anesthesia . Patients randomly assign ( microsoft excel program providing random number 1-4 ) one four group : 1 . Lidocaine 50 mg 10 cc syringe 2 . Magnesium sulfate 0.25 g ( 2 mOsmol ) 10 cc syringe 3 . 0.9 % saline 10 cc syringe 4 . Lidocaine 50 mg 0.25 g ( 2 mOsmol ) magnesium sulfate 10 cc syringe Study drug prepare identical syrinx Pharmaceutical Research Center ( PRC ) . Study personnel receive syringe label study number well data collection sheet label study number . A 20 gauge angiocatheter insert dorsum hand IV fluid medication administration . Subjects give preoperative 1-2 mg intravenous midazolam sedation subject en route operating room typically do discretion anesthesia provider care patient . After institute standard monitor provide preoxygenation , study drug inject . Twenty second later , 50 mg propofol inject . Ten second infusion propofol , subject ask standard question pain injection `` Are pain IV site ? '' . Any behavioral sign facial grimacing , arm withdrawal , tear note . Pain assess use four point scale : 0=no pain , 1=mild pain ( pain report response question without behavioral sign ) , 2=moderate pain ( pain report response question accompanied behavioral sign , pain report spontaneously without question ) , 3=severe pain ( strong vocal response response accompany facial grimacing , arm withdrawal , tear ) . Study key personnel pain assessment ; behavioral sign self-reporting pain record separate one another . The induction anesthesia complete appropriate amount propofol . Formally assess pain follow injection something standard care patient currently warn prior injection may experience warmth burn site intravenous line .</detailed_description>
