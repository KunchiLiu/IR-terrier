	<brief_title>Pioglitazone Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Stage IA-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate mechanism ( ) action pioglitazone candidate chemopreventive agent lung cancer investigate effect Ki-67 define non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) tumor tissue . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect pioglitazone multiple marker list : - Tumor tissue : caspase-3 , cyclin D1 , p21/Waf1 , peroxisome proliferative activate receptor , gamma ( PPARγ ) , mucin 1 ( MUC1 ) . - Premalignant tissue : Ki-67 , caspase-3 , PPARγ . - Histologically normal tissue : Ki-67 , PPARγ . II . To evaluate toxicity safety pioglitazone patient population . III . To analyze expression serum marker affect pioglitazone . IV . To describe effect limited treatment pioglitazone tumor metabolic activity determine FDG-PET ( assess minimum 2 week treatment ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive pioglitazone hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 14-42 day . Patients undergo surgery .</detailed_description>
