	<brief_summary>Study Design This multicenter , open label , first line phase II study elderly ( ≥ 65 year old ) metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma ( mRCC ) patient suitable currently approve treatment ( bevacizumab+INF , cytokine sunitinib ) except sorafenib . Each patient treat sorafenib enrol study train observe management tool skin care . A study period 3 year estimate follow : enrollment period 24 month follow-up period 12 month . Objectives trial Primary objective The primary aim trial evaluation efficacy patient education program reduction Hand-Foot Skin Reaction ( HFSR ) . Secondary Objectives TO ass : - The frequency dose discontinuation , interruption reduction - The incidence grade diarrhoea , adverse event - The overall Response Rate accord RECIST criterion . - Progression free survival ( PFR ) study population comparison PFS age sub group current study population</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale present study For several decade , systemic management metastatic renal cell cancer ( mRCC ) confine use interferon ( IFN ) interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . Recently , option medical management mRCC improve introduction agent target tumour angiogenesis intracellular pathway mediate growth proliferation . Among agent small molecule inhibitor sorafenib ( Nexavar ) , sunitinib ( Sutent ) , temsirolimus ( Torisel ) everolimus , monoclonal antibody bevacizumab ( Avastin ) . All target agent show significantly extend progression-free overall survival compare placebo IFN therapy treatment mRCC . Adverse event commonly observe clinical practice use small molecule inhibitor mRCC patient . Concerning use bevacizumab commonly observe adverse event hypertension , proteinuria , bleed thrombosis . For sunitinib frequent adverse event include hand-foot syndrome , stomatitis , diarrhea , fatigue , hypothyroidism hypertension . Most common adverse event sorafenib hand foot skin reaction ( HFSR ) rash , desquamation , fatigue , diarrhea , nausea , hypothyroidism hypertension.Several study recommendation publish order suggest manage sorafenib adverse reaction particular HFSR . The aim study evaluate patient education program prevention dermatological event ( HFSR , rash , desquamation ) reduce onset adverse event ( grade ) . The reduction dermatological adverse effect would concomitantly limit frequency sorafenib dose reduction interruption mRCC patient suitable cytokine anti-angiogenesis ( bevacizumab sunitinib ) therapy first line treatment . Treatment Administration Sorafenib orally administer daily dose 400 mg take twice daily without food , least one hour two hour eat . Four week treatment consider cycle . Each patient enrol study receive medication topical therapy . Dermatological medication provide free . In case toxicity , dose reduction/interruption permit accord flow charts/dose modification . In case disease progression , unacceptable toxicity Sorafenib administration discontinue . The patient consider `` treatment '' Sorafenib intake stop 30 consecutive day patient consider survival .</detailed_description>
