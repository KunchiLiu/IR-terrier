	<brief_summary>The primary objective study ( Phase 1 ) determine subject unresectable metastatic bladder cancer never chemotherapy , dose lenalidomide well-tolerated give combination gemcitabine plus cisplatin ( Phase 2 ) study recommend dose subject evaluate progression-free survival 1 year . The secondary objective determine objective response rate treatment , safety combination therapy gemcitabine , cisplatin lenalidomide well evaluate lenalidomide maintenance treatment subject achieve objective response stable disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Urothelial carcinoma urinary bladder second common genitourinary malignancy . Based result large randomized study compare MVAC gemcitabine plus cisplatin , latter regimen become treatment standard base improved tolerability . While tolerability chemotherapy patient advance urothelial carcinoma improve , significant improvement efficacy since advent MVAC 1980 's novel approach clearly need . The current study explore safety activity lenalidomide combination gemcitabine plus cisplatin first line chemotherapy subject metastatic urothelial carcinoma . The primary objective phase Ib portion determine recommend phase II dose combination gemcitabine , cisplatin , plus lenalidomide patient advanced/metastatic urothelial carcinoma . The primary objective phase II portion progression-free survival 1 year . The secondary objective evaluate activity ( determine objective response rate ) ; determine safety ( per Common Terminology Adverse Events version 4.0 ) combination therapy gemcitabine , cisplatin plus lenalidomide ; evaluate lenalidomide maintenance treatment patient achieve objective response stable disease follow completion 6 cycle combination therapy ; determine impact treatment peripheral blood immune cell subset circulate tumor cell . Patients receive gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 IV day 1 + 8 cisplatin 70 mg/m2 IV day 1 21 day cycle . Lenalidomide give orally day 1-14 dose escalate successive cohort phase Ib portion define recommend phase II dose . Patients continue gemcitabine , cisplatin , plus lenalidomide 6 cycle , absence disease progression prohibitive toxicity . After completion 6 cycle therapy , patient achieve least `` stable disease '' proceed `` maintenance '' lenalidomide give orally day 1-21 28-day cycle . Treatment continue , absence prohibitive toxicity , time disease progression .</detailed_description>
