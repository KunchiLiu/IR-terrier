	<brief_title>Circadian Rhythms Aqueous Humor Dynamics When Using Brimonidine Humans With Ocular Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , effective treatment prevent disease progression lower intraocular pressure ( IOP ) .2 Usually , clinical IOP measurement perform day little information collect nocturnal IOP . A recent surge interest nocturnal IOPs stem hypothesis significant glaucomatous damage may occur night.4,5 In response , investigator advocate particular class glaucoma medication base nocturnal IOP effects.6-8 The efficacious drug market may prefer treatment ineffective night . Therefore , understand nighttime IOP aqueous humor dynamic control important scientific , clinical , commercial implication . Previous research glaucoma medication limited effect ocular hypotensive drug 24-hour IOP daytime aqueous humor dynamic . Few study evaluate nocturnal aqueous humor dynamic . The investigator recently complete study day night difference aqueous humor dynamic patient treat drug three different class include prostaglandin analog , beta blocker carbonic anhydrase inhibitor . The current study design elucidate physiological mechanism drive efficacy brimonidine , alpha 2 adrenergic agonist , throughout 24-hour period , i.e . circadian rhythm aqueous humor dynamic . Based investigator know 24 hour IOPs drug expect work well night potentially enhance uveoscleral outflow . This study test hypothesis . In study new glaucoma medication prefer study population include ocular hypertensive subject . These people high IOP optic nerve damage glaucoma . They may take prescribed IOP lower drug condition may . Those take ocular drug ask stop taking . Since glaucoma drug affect aqueous humor dynamic different way , essential residual medical effect remain drug . A washout period necessary remove topical ocular drug effect . A concern patient safety exists OHT patient take glaucoma medication , IOP may rise washout period . In order monitor IOP patient , biweekly check IOP make . If pressure rise ophthalmologist 's preset `` target pressure '' point , patient remove study return his/her previous medical regimen .</detailed_description>
