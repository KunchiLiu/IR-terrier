	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) rare , progressive , highly debilitate disease characterize vascular obstruction variable presence vasoconstriction , lead increase pulmonary vascular resistance right-sided heart failure . If leave untreated , PAH ultimately lead right ventricular failure death ; adult subject median survival 2.8 year without treatment . Epidemiological estimate vary prevalence Europe think order 15 case per million . Large scale epidemiology study PAH child conduct limited outcome data paediatric PAH patient . A register France ( 1995-1996 ) estimate prevalence child low 3.7 case per million . In national , comprehensive country wide survey epidemiology idiopathic PAH ( IPAH ) management survival United Kingdom ( UK ) incidence 0.48 case per million child per year prevalence 2.1 case per million child . Ambrisentan ( VOLIBRIS™ tablet ) endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) market European Union ( EU ) country GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) United States LETAIRIS® Gilead Sciences Inc. Ambrisentan indicate treatment adult patient PAH improve exercise capacity , decrease symptom PAH , delay clinical worsening . The primary purpose long term paediatric study provide clinically relevant information long term safety ambrisentan child common cause PAH age group .
