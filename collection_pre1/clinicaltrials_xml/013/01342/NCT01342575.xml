	<brief_title>Improvement Trans-operatory X-ray Visualization During Anterior Cervical Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anterior cervical spine surgery ( ACSS ) one common spine surgery perform neurosurgeon . One challenge aspect ACSS achieve correct visualization identification low level specifically fifth sixth cervical vertebra due difficulty penetrate X-ray beam shoulder . Several method tap shoulder throughout entire case tie strap around wrist pull caudally temporally shoot X-rays use try improve visualization surgery . Both method may cause problem brachial plexus injury , shoulder dislocation peripheral nerve injury . The foot compression maneuver test term 's efficacy security , well compare four previous described maneuver , use intra-operative neurophysiology monitoring ( IONM ) . 50 consecutive patient program elective ACSS could meet inclusion criterion monitor IONM use transcranial electric motor evoke potential ( tceMEPs ) , somatosensory evoke potential ( SSEPs ) spontaneous electromyography ( EMG ) total endovenous anesthesia . On operating table , basal lateral x-ray picture first determination IONM perform use comparison . Five maneuver sequentially perform : 1 ) Feet compression , 2 ) Arm traction , 3 ) Arm traction plus foot compression combine , 4 ) Shoulder tap 5 ) Shoulder tap plus foot compression . All five maneuver maintain 1 min , time IONM test change voltage amplitude duration potentially could risky ( risky define change determination 50 % compare basal determination ) . Lateral x-ray perform maneuver measure change segment visualization level expose . After maneuver complete , proceed surgery schedule .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients stable biomechanically cervical pathology ( like disk herniation , vertebral tumor , etc . ) , schedule ACSS Any cervical pathology associate segmental instability History shoulder , arm , elbow wrist pathology , include surgery implant .
