	<brief_title>Trial Open Milligan-Morgan Haemorrhoidectomy Versus Laser Closed Haemorrhoidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Haemorrhoidectomy ( excision haemorrhoid ) procedure choice grade 3 &amp; 4 symptomatic haemorrhoid . The standard technique UK ( open Milligan-Morgan ) excise haemorrhoid general anaesthetic ( typically use electrocautery ) leave raw area anal canal . As result , patient often experience significant post operative pain impact patient function week follow surgery . This would consider gold standard operative treatment haemorrhoid . Due difficult post operative recovery procedure , alternative technique perform haemorrhoidectomy explore . One approach , gain popularity , staple haemorrhoidectomy [ 1 ] . In technique , circular stapling device use excise proximal mucosa order disconnect haemorrhoidal blood supply pull haemorrhoidal mass . The edge excise mucosa simultaneously close row staple . In recent meta-analysis 29 randomise control trial include 2056 patient , staple haemorrhoidectomy associate reduce postoperative pain reduction return activity nearly 12 day comparison open haemorrhoidectomy [ 2 ] . Although postoperative complication rate similar , staple haemorrhoidectomy associate significantly recurrence long term ( relative risk 2.29 ) . The stapled haemorrhoidectomy technique gain universal acceptance . This may relate cost availability staple device many centre . Unlike specialized stapling device , laser widely available operate theatre use many operation cauterise tissue . The result burn superficial comparison electrocautery . Consequently , laser use perform open haemorrhoidectomy expectation reduce post operative pain . However , randomise trial compare use laser versus cold scalpel open haemorrhoidectomy show significant difference post operative pain [ 3 ] . Although , laser appear offer advantage open haemorrhoidal procedure , alternative technique laser haemorrhoidectomy develop Peter Thompson Laser Haemorrhoid Centre Phoenix , Arizona . In alternative technique , laser use seal raw mucosal edge excision pile . In common stapled haemorrhoidectomy , mucosa seal close rather left open . Consequently , patient appear experience markedly less post operative pain . The technique also simple quick shallow learn curve . Due speed relative comfort procedure , patient may routinely operate use sedation local anaesthetic , rather full general anaesthetic standard practice haemorrhoidectomy . Over last 2 year , investigator perform laser haemorrhoidectomy 60 patient . The age range 32 81 year .The ratio male : female 31:29 . All do local anaesthesia sedation except one ( 1.6 % ) convert general anaesthesia . All patient except 2 ( 3.5 % ) discharge within two hour operation . One delayed due administration general anaesthesia second one admit post operative bleeding actively observe three day , discharge . There four re-admissions ( 6.6 % ) , two post operative oedema &amp; two oedema pain . All actively observe discharge later . Four patient ( 6.6 % ) also develop chronic anal fissure post operatively , two heal six week course Glyceryl Tri Nitrate ( GTN ) cream two conservative management non-healing fissure . The investigator wish objectively determine whether laser close haemorrhoidectomy associate significantly less post operative pain earlier return function comparison Milligan-Morgan Haemorrhoidectomy standard procedure perform across trust .</detailed_description>
