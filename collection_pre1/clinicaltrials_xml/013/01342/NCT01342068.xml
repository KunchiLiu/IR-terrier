	<brief_summary>Thoracic Outlet Syndrome ( TOS ) condition cause numbness , tingle weakness patient 's upper limb . Symptoms due compression restriction nerve blood vessel ( neurovascular bundle ) extend neck upper limb exert patient 's various anatomical structure . Neurovascular bundle compression result decrease nerve conduction blood flow artery supply structure downstream restrict site . These anatomical restriction include tight scalene muscle neck , tighten pectorialis minor muscle chest extra rib grow C7 vertebra . TOS diagnose use special test design re-elicit neurovascular bundle compression . Upon obtain positive test , patient undergo osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) change anatomical restriction allow decrease symptom even eradication syndrome altogether . Although diagnosis treatment TOS common osteopathic medicine , effectiveness diagnostic special test treatment thoroughly investigate . This study aim examine effectiveness special test ( Adson 's , Wright 's hyperabduction Halstead maneuver ) diagnose change blood flow artery upper arm compare evaluation Doppler ultrasound measure blood flow test perform . Patients positive test treat OMT include myofascial release , soft tissue , articulation relieve restrict structure . Upon completion treatment , special test perform along Doppler ultrasound measure blood flow blood vessel . Results analyze statistically significance ability correctly diagnose treat TOS symptom . Results study contribute towards validity teach special test osteopathic medical school allow non-invasive treatment protocol patient TOS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In today 's hectic society become great disadvantage individual develop pain discomfort decrease ability function efficiently . Thoracic Outlet Syndrome ( TOS ) condition cause pain upper extremity , typically extend along inner aspect arm hand . Other symptom include weakness , numbness tingle upper extremity . A neurovascular bundle consist brachial plexus , subclavian artery vein travel neck arm . TOS symptoms result nerve blood vessel compress surround anatomical structure . In perform research study , team would like improve awareness TOS health care professional entrapment neuropathy differential diagnosis neck pain refer pain . We would also like bring osteopathic medicine , physical therapy paradigm musculoskeletal manual medicine/therapy together develop standardized valid approach diagnosis treatment TOS currently available . There multiple possible cause TOS , majority result anatomic restriction . These possible cause include trauma shoulder girdle commonly postural disturbance . Individuals TOS often sit computer desk extend period time work school . They develop rounded shoulder forward head carriage change length tone certain muscle relationship structure relation neurovascular bundle . The anatomic disturbance contribute great interest osteopathy include hypertonicity anterior middle scalene muscle neck , hypertonicity pectorialis muscle upper extremity 3-5th rib , somatic dysfunction clavicle , upper thoracic region rib ( especially first rib ) ( Ward , 2003 ) . TOS often result diagnosis elimination possible condition cause similar symptom . These possible condition include disc herniation , osteoarthritis , tumor nerve entrapment syndrome carpal tunnel syndrome . Currently discrepancies exist clinician correct approach diagnosis treatment TOS . Today 's technological advancement help provide information patient 's anatomy , however none use diagnosis alone . MRIs usually best used confirmation evaluation region interest , however TOS , finding frequently inconclusive . One reason may difficulty evaluate extent muscle spasm rib somatic dysfunction degree compress nerve structure . ( Koknel 2005 ) . X-rays used eliminate extra ribs cervical region cause symptom . Anomalous cervical rib find 0.17 % 0.74 % year , however , 10 % individual experience TOS symptoms onset symptom often relate cervical spine trauma ( Novak , Mackinnon , 2002 ) . The diagnosis TOS remain best base patient 's subjective complaint , physical examination exclusion pathology ( Novak , Mackinnon , 2002 ) . Clinical assessment TOS best achieve reproduction symptom compression special orthopaedic provocative test re-produces symptom base patient position ( Koknel , 2005 ) . These orthopedic special test include : Wright Test ( See picture appendix 2 ) : Wright Test , Hyperabduction Test , do bringing arm full abduction shoulder externally rotate elbow extend monitoring radial pulse throughout ( Magee DJ , 2008 ) . If decrease absence pulse test positive showing axillary artery compress either pectoralis minor muscle coracoid process . ( KÃ¶knel Talu G , 2005 ) Adson Test ( See picture appendix 3 ) : For Adson Maneuver examiner externally rotate extends effected arm elbow extend monitoring radial pulse . The patient instruct rotate head toward affected side , extend neck take deep breath hold . The absence disappearance pulse indicate positive test ( Magee DJ , 2008 ) . In 1947 , Adson first describe test explanation alteration radial pulse alteration blood pressure consider pathognomonic sign scalenus anticus syndrome indicate vascular component neurovascular bundle compress scalenus anticus muscle . ( Mackinnon SE , 2002 ) Halstead Maneuver ( See picture appendix 4 ) : The Reverse-Adson Maneuver , Halstead Maneuver , also do patient 's arm externally rotate extended elbow extend . The examiner monitor radial pulse patient rotates head away affected side extend neck . The patient instruct take deep breath hold . The absence disappearance pulse indicate positive test suggest presence cervical rib ( Magee DJ , 2008 ) Roos Test ( See picture appendix 5 ) : This test use screen interested participant recruitment phase . The patient stand abducts arm 90 degree , externally rotate shoulder flex elbow 90 degree . The patient direct open close hand slowly three minute . A positive test cause increase symptom ischemic pain , heaviness profound weakness arm numbness tingle hand . Minor fatigue consider negative test . ( Magee DJ , 2008 ) Positive finding indicate compression neurovascular bundle specific structure thoracic outlet . In previous study test efficacy TOS special test , Doppler ultrasonography show visualize vascular abnormality confirm diagnosis patient least five positive provocative ( special ) test . ( Gillard , Perez-Cousin , Hachulla , Remy et al 2001 ) . Our research team would like confirm previous find expand topic examine change blood flow Doppler ultrasonography performance special test . Diagnostic ultrasound use since late 1950s . There confirmed adverse biological effect patient usage . Although hazard identify would limit use diagnostic ultrasound patient education research , experience normal diagnostic practice may may experience hazard due extend exposure time altered condition . Participants enrol study inform anticipated exposure condition compare normal diagnostic practice ( AIUM , 2007 ) . In addition evaluation effectiveness TOS special test , effect Osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) help alleviate TOS symptom also interest . OMT TOS direct towards improve mechanic cervical , upper thoracic spine , upper rib , clavicle muscle neck , shoulder pectoral girdle . OMT procedures myofascial release articulatory technique useful reduce dysfunction region cause compression nerve . Myofascial release involve manipulate soft tissue , articulation take joint available range motion improve normal physiological movement ( Ward , 2003 ) . By perform research improve body research osteopathic manipulative medicine ( OMM ) provide proven mean treat pain experienced individual TOS . TOS diagnosis treatment teach osteopathic medical student , physical therapy student well health professional employ manual therapy strategy diagnose treat musculoskeletal disorder .
