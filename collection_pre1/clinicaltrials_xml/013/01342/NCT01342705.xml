	<brief_title>Phlebotomy Risk Hepatocellular Carcinoma Patients With Compensated Alcoholic Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose The role iron liver carcinogenesis support human , animal cellular model direct indirect mechanism . The accumulation iron promote liver cell proliferation responsible direct structural damage mutation DNA cause free iron reactive oxygen specie generate accumulation liver . The influence hepatic iron overload ( HIO ) risk hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) well establish patient genetic hemochromatosis HCC develop non-cirrhotic liver . However , influence HIO risk occurrence HCC chronic liver disease ( include alcoholic viral C ) controversial . Recently , prospective study include large population patient cirrhosis ( n = 301 ) classify accord aetiology liver disease ( alcohol , n = 162 hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection , n = 139 ) show association HIO occurrence HCC patient alcoholic cirrhosis . Thus , assessment liver iron routine clinical practice could allow identification patient higher risk develop HCC preventive measure iron depletion phlebotomy could undertake . Based model genetic hemochromatosis effectiveness survival improvement even regression hepatic injury show , effectiveness prognosis prevention HCC occurrence patient alcoholic cirrhosis must study prospective multicentre randomize trial . The main objective study ass patient compensate alcoholic cirrhosis HIO , assess MRI , effect phlebotomy order low maintain serum ferritin 50 µg / l risk HCC occurrence . The effect bloodletting jointly evaluate 1 ) episode hepatic decompensation , 2 ) non HCC liver-related mortality 3 ) change HIO follow-up . Study Type : Interventional Study Design : Allocation : Randomized Endpoint Classification : Efficacy Study Intervention Model : Parallel Assignment Masking : Open Label Primary Purpose : Prevention</detailed_description>
