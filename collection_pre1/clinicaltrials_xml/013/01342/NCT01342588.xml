	<brief_title>Accuracy Lumbar Pedicle Screw Placement Assisted With Continuous Pulse-train Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pedicle screw instrumentation part spine surgery recurrent technique use spine surgeon . Since description Boucher 1959 popularization later Roy-Camille , consider technique demand great anatomy knowledge grade expertise . Even experience hand misplacement pedicle screw could incidence 10-40 % ( average 20 % ) . Medially misplacements track creation screw insertion fear complication , anatomic relationship medial pedicle wall neural structure . The first attempt use continuous electrical stimulation pedicle track creation screw insertion communicate 1997 Welch WC , et al . In study use bone impedance direct measurement pedicle wall integrity ; unfortunately use inhaled anesthetic assess final screw position plain X-rays . They report sensibility specificity 98 % 99 % respectively . The great limitation study assessment screw accuracy perform plain X-rays , day best way compute tomography ( CT ) . After Welch report , couple study use similar technique thoracic spine try avoid neurological injury pedicle screw insertion , none describe use continuous train pulse screw . The present study pretend evaluate final accuracy trans-operative usefulness pulse train stimulation track creation screw insertion use intra venous anesthetic agent CT scan assess integrity pedicle wall</detailed_description>
