	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose etoposide mitoxantrone hydrochloride give together cyclosporine pravastatin sodium see well work treat patient relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Cyclosporine may inhibit efflux cancer drug cancer cell may thereby improve chemotherapy treatment AML . Pravastatin sodium may stop growth cancer cell block nutrient need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , etoposide mitoxantrone hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving cyclosporine together pravastatin sodium , etoposide , mitoxantrone hydrochloride may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dos mitoxantrone ( mitoxantrone hydrochloride ) etoposide combination pravastatin ( pravastatin sodium ) cyclosporine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe complete remission ( CR ) /CR incomplete peripheral blood count recovery ( CRi ) rate 2 cycle induction therapy . II . Describe disease-free survival patient achieve CR/CRi . III . Estimate frequency severity regimen-associated toxicity , along 28-day mortality start study treatment . OUTLINE : This phase I/II , dose-escalation study etoposide mitoxantrone hydrochloride combination pravastatin sodium cyclosporine . Patients receive cyclosporine intravenously ( IV ) continuously day 5-9 . Patients also receive pravastatin sodium orally ( PO ) every 6 hour day 1-10 , etoposide IV continuously day 5-9 , mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV continuously day 5-9 . Treatment repeat 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve CR/CRi may receive 2 additional course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
