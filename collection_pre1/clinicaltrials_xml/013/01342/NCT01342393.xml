	<brief_title>Proof Concept Study First-Sight Refractive Error Correction : Direct Comparison Manifest Refraction Autorefraction Results</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uncorrected refractive error frequent cause visual impairment global population . In 2006 , World Health Organization release global estimate visual impairment . According finding , approximately 314 million people world whose vision impair . Of population 90 % individual live develop country 153 million case believe due uncorrected refractive error . The impact uncorrected refractive error great , include , limited , loss employment opportunity , inability care family , inability receive education . The challenge determine effective accessible method detect refractive error dispense spectacle good vision . In clinical setting , refractive error correct prescribe spectacle contact lens daily basis . Typically patient first undergo autorefraction , computer-controlled machine use objectively calculate refractive error present start point subjective refraction test . This machine , however , cumbersome easily transportable abroad . Typically machine hold patient 's forehead ask look machine distant object . While look object machine calculates refractive error . Next , patient undergoes manifest refraction , subjective refractive test require use trial lens patient response improve result calculated autorefraction , result best correct visual acuity patient prescription patient receive spectacle tailor need . As testimony prevalent uncorrected refractive error develop world , refractive error Nigerian adult prevalence spectacle use study . In article title Refractive error Nigerian adult : prevalence , type spectacle coverage , researcher look type refractive error ability shelf spectacles meet corrective need 13,599 Nigerian adult . Patients underwent autorefraction detail clinical exam discover uncorrected refractive error responsible 77.9 % visual impairment 20/40 20/60 level , 57.1 % 20/60 20/200 level . It also find spectacle could improve vision 1,279 adult 20/40 range 882 participant 20/60 level . However , 3-4 % individual wear spectacle . First-Sight simplify way correct refractive error . It easily portable , make accessible remote area world . Unlike study cite , First-Sight bring remote area clinic available patient able afford pay clinic visit . As simplified technique , local health care worker may easily able learn use First-Sight dispense spectacle need . Lastly , sponsor First-Sight provide refract kit custom-made spectacle cost health care worker patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must 19 year age older . A refractive error 4.50 +4.50 diopter spherical error astigmatism 1.50 diopter manifest refraction autorefraction document patient 's medical record . Best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) 20/20 manifest refraction . No known ocular pathology previous clinical exam may limit best correct visual acuity . Refractive error great 4.50 +4.50 diopter , astigmatism great 1.50 diopter . Known ocular ( corneal , lenticular , vitreal , retinal ) pathology may limit BCVA . Best correct visual acuity spectacles 20/25 worse . Any previous surgical laser procedure may limit BCVA 18 year age young</criteria>
