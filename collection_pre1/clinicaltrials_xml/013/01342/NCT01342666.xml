	<brief_title>Tomato Consumption High Density Lipoprotein-cholesterol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) main cause death worldwide ( 1 ) well recognize risk factor associate development . Low high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( HDL-c ) rank among common lipid abnormality associate CVD ( 2 ) . Low HDL-c currently define HDL-c value 40 mg/dL men 50 mg/dL woman ( 3 ) . Factors relate low HDL-c cigarette smoking ( 4 ) , high triglyceride ( 5 ) , sedentary lifestyle ( 6 ) , insulin resistance ( 7 ) . Non-pharmacologic strategy increase HDL-c concentration increase alcohol ( 8 ) fish consumption ( 9 ) , weight reduction ( 3 ) , increment physical activity ( 10 ) , smoke cessation ( 8 ) . Some strategy applicable hard implement individual affect low HDL-c . Moreover , low-income country , intervention could costly general population . Vegetables consumption could affordable accessible option treat low HDL-c. Epidemiologic evidence indicate high consumption vegetable reduces risk cardiovascular disease ( 11 ) particular attention receive tomato-based product . Growing evidence several epidemiological study indicate lycopene , major carotenoid tomato ( 12 ) , might important carotenoid prevent atherosclerosis CVD ( 13 , 14 ) . The consumption 7 serving per week tomato-based product associate 30 % reduction relative risk CVD ( 15 ) . Such potential benefit vascular health tomato-rich diet could relate low arterial intimal wall thickness ( 13 , 16 ) , reduction LDL cholesterol level ( 17 ) , inverse correlation marker inflammation vascular endothelial dysfunction ( 18 ) . However , HDL-c level could also positively influenced tomato consumption . In pilot study find tomato juice consumption increase HDL-c one month ( unpublished data ) , find also recently report another group ( 19 ) . In contrast , study show daily consumption 300g uncooked tomato , one month significantly increase HDL-c level 15.2 % ( 20 ) . However , study control , blind , neither randomize . Roma tomatoes consumption could accessible intervention improve HDL-c level ; however , longitudinal clinical trial necessary evaluate association . Therefore , perform randomize , open-label , single blind , clinical trial specifically evaluate consumption two uncooked tomato per day ( 14 servings/week ) one month could produce favorable effect HDL-c .</detailed_description>
