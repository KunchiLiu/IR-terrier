	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study magnetic resonance spectroscopy image predict response patient vorinostat temozolomide patient recurrent , progressive , newly diagnose glioblastoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Vorinostat may also help temozolomide work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Imaging procedure , magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging , may help measure patient 's response vorinostat temozolomide allow doctor plan good treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging Predicting Response Vorinostat Temozolomide Patients With Recurrent Progressive Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate strength association magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) image measurable biomarkers response vorinostat plus temozolomide . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate MRS-detected inositol N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) level ( 3 tesla ) indicator mood alteration measure self-report depression survey ( IDS-SR ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day -7 -1 ( course 1 ) day 8-14 22-28 temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients previously treat standard radiotherapy temozolomide receive maintenance temozolomide PO day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo magnetic resonance spectroscopy image baseline approximately 1 8 week treatment . Patients also undergo Inventory Depression Symptomatology Self-Reported ( IDS-SR ) assessment baseline periodically study .</detailed_description>
