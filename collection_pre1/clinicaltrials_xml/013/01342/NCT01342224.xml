	<brief_title>Immunochemoradiotherapy Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All study participant receive initial 4 week course intra-dermal vaccination telomerase vaccine ( GV1001 ) immune adjuvant , granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) , along cycle gemcitabine chemotherapy . This follow concurrent radiation therapy low-dose intravenous ( IV ) gemcitabine chemotherapy give twice weekly follow one additional dose vaccine . About 4 week ( late 8 week ) chemotherapy radiation treatment , participant disease remove surgery proceed surgery . After recovery , immunochemotherapy resume . Participants stable responsive disease able treat surgery proceed immunochemotherapy . Immunochemotherapy consist 2 cycle telomerase vaccine GM-CSF along gemcitabine chemotherapy . Participants disease able treat surgery , worsen follow immunochemoradiotherapy phase treatment may continue study transition immunochemotherapy phase treatment . Tadalafil administer orally daily basis start therapy ( Day 1 ) completion therapy dose hold required immediate perioperative period patient proceed surgery .</detailed_description>
