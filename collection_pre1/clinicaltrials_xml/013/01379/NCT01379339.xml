	<brief_title>Cabazitaxel - PF Induction Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary study objective follow : - To assess safety , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity cabazitaxel combine cisplatin Follow-Up ( FU ) induction chemotherapy patient locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) . - To establish phase II recommend dose cabazitaxel combine cisplatin Follow-Up induction patient locally advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck . The secondary study objective , regard combine Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil regimen patient newly diagnose squamous cell carcinoma head neck , follow : - To assess toxicity profile - To assess best Overall Response Rate ( complete partial response ) completion 3 cycle treatment - To assess Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) Overall Survival ( OS ) 3 year Analysis secondary variable primarily descriptive nature due small sample size . All result consider hypothesis generate confirmed future study . Patient , inform consent obtain meet inclusion/exclusion criterion screen evaluation perform within one-week window , assign dose level accord dose escalation rule describe protocol . Treatment consist Induction chemotherapy period , period patient undergo 3 cycle Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil ( PF ) . The Induction chemotherapy follow Consolidation Therapy , 6-7 week Chemoradiation treatment Surgery + Recovery time , depend primary site overall medical condition . Both treatment period consist approximately 16 week ( 9 week Induction 7 week Consolidation , Chemoradiation Radiation Therapy ( CRT ) ) , short 16 week , surgery . After three cycle , patient assess clinical , radiographic , pathologic response Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil begin Chemoradiation Radiation Therapy surgery . Patients , complete three cycle Cabazitaxel-Platinum Fluorouracil reason toxicity , progressive disease , choice , medical necessity , treat standard Chemoradiation Radiation Therapy surgery depend primary site overall medical condition . Once Consolidation treatment complete , follow-up patient 3 year .</detailed_description>
