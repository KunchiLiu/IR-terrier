	<detailed_description>Evidence-based treatment ( EBTs ) depression often available person need ; particularly true psychotherapy . Even available , EBTs often poorly deliver less-than-optimal quality . High direct indirect cost also limit availability EBTs . Together barrier contribute suboptimal treatment depression community . In preliminary step toward address quality shortcoming , investigator propose conduct blend efficacy- effectiveness randomize control trial ( RCT ) high fidelity , Internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) depression , extend previous research maximize treatment availability quality well reduce cost . Over 36-month recruitment period , investigator enroll 1,800 adult seek care depression 3 rural healthcare clinic , 3 safety net federally qualify healthcare center ( FQHCs ) , 2 non-profit HMOs . Participants randomize : ( ) treatment usual ( TAU ) control condition , typically antidepressants and/or psychosocial service ; ( b ) TAU plus Pure self-help Internet CBT depression , consist access Internet site without contact therapist ; ( c ) TAU plus Guided self-help Internet CBT , consist access Internet site plus brief , periodic telephone contact therapist ; ( ) Stepped-Care Internet CBT condition , start TAU + Pure self-help CBT progressing Guided self-help CBT adequate progress observe early .

The investigator conduct cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEA ) , investigator project substantial difference direct cost study arm . The investigator also examine TAU healthcare utilization ( medication , visit , etc ) electronic medical record ( EMR ) , bill system , participant report . The investigator hypothesize cost per depression free day ( DFDs ) quality- adjust life year ( QALYs ) low Pure CBT , relative Guided Stepped-Care CBT TAU . The investigator also hypothesize cost per unit improvement QALYs DFDs well Stepped-Care compare Guided CBT . Additional aim include exploratory examination secondary outcome , predictor moderator outcomes among intervention . The investigator also collect quantitative qualitative data patient , provider , organizational factor may impede facilitate implementation intervention , help prepare future dissemination effort . Finally , reapplication investigator add non-research Reach Estimation Phase good estimate acceptance retention rate condition closely match real-world dissemination</detailed_description>
