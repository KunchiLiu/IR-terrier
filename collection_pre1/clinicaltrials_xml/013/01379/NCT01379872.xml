	<brief_summary>The Trans Tasman Radiation Oncology Group ( TROG ) commission Department Health Ageing undertake project ass new Radiation Oncology Technology Treatments . This project undertaken response recognise need Medicare Benefits Schedule support appropriate new radiation oncology technology treatments become available , ensure optimal patient care . The first phase project require TROG develop Generic Research Framework ( Framework ) capable collect generate information substantiate safety , clinical efficacy cost effectiveness new technology treatment . The second ( current ) phase project require Framework pilot assess safety , clinical efficacy cost effectiveness Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) Image Guided Radiation Therapy ( IGRT ) four tumour site specific region : A . Post Prostatectomy ( IMRT ) B. Anal Cancer ( IMRT ) C. Nasopharynx ( IMRT ) D. Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer ( IGRT ) The aim site specific component ANROTAT protocol follow : Protocol A . Develop approach apply Framework evaluate safety , clinical efficacy cost-effectiveness IMRT compare 3DCRT patient prostate cancer ( PP ) . Protocol B . Develop approach apply Framework evaluate safety , clinical efficacy cost-effectiveness IMRT compare 3DCRT AC . Protocol C. Develop approach apply Framework evaluate safety , clinical efficacy cost-effectiveness IMRT compare 3DCRT NPC . Protocol D. Develop approach apply Framework evaluate safety , clinical efficacy cost-effectiveness IGRT compare non-IGRT patient intermediate risk prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The ANROTAT study divide four tumour site specific study . A decision analytic model construct disease area/technology estimate safety , clinical efficacy cost effectiveness new technology compare conventional standard treatment approach . This incorporate information previous study data series component study include dosimetric evaluation , QoL evaluation , evaluation cost treatment plan delivery . The development refinement model integral component plan research program . The overall protocol detail data collection activity identify feasible useful informing development series decision analytic model evaluate IMRT IGRT four specify cancer . These activity involve collection dosimetry data , quality life ( QoL ) toxicity data , health care resource usage data series component study . These data use conjunction evidence exist literature expert opinion inform construction decision analytic model . Data collect least 10 treatment centre site specific study . Data transcribe onto CRFs source data form . The CRFs send TROG Cancer Research secure fax line . Participant 's treatment plan securely upload TROG Central Quality Management System ( CQMS ) plan review . The data collect , number participant tasks participant outline site specific study . WBRC invite participate Studies A B , however , ethic approval seek entire ANROTAT protocol centre approval option participate component ANROTAT require . Study Protocol A IMRT versus 3DCRT Post Prostatectomy : The post prostatectomy study methodology applies ANROTAT framework include series component study include dosimetric evaluation , QoL/toxicity evaluation , evaluation cost treatment plan delivery . This involve collection data approximately 30 patient . Data collection include eligibility , adverse events/toxicity , QoL , patient cost , dosimetry parameter ( contour , planning , quality assurance , treatment data ) . These data use conjunction evidence exist literature expert opinion inform construction decision analytic model . Centres ask provide two retrospective one prospective patient vary accord availability retrospective patient participate centre . Each centre provide detail case selection . Data collect directly patient include QoL toxicity data well cost incur patient result treatment . Study Protocol B IMRT versus 3DCRT Anal Cancer : The anal canal study methodology applies ANROTAT framework include series component study include dosimetric evaluation , QoL/toxicity evaluation , healthcare resource usage . This involve collection data 30 patient . Data collection include eligibility , adverse events/toxicity , QoL , patient cost , dosimetry parameter ( contour , planning , quality assurance , treatment data ) . These data use conjunction evidence exist literature expert opinion inform construction decision analytic model . Participating centre ask provide data contour planning CT data set send participate centre . Following , participate centre plan 3 retrospective patient case . In addition , data collect 10 prospective anal cancer patient ask complete QoL patient cost questionnaire . Study Protocol C IMRT versus 3DCRT NPC : The nasopharynx study methodology applies ANROTAT framework include series component study include dosimetric evaluation , QoL/toxicity evaluation , healthcare resource usage . This involve collection data 30 patient dosimetry component 150 patient QoL component . Data collection include eligibility , adverse events/toxicity , QoL , patient cost , dosimetry parameter ( contour , planning , quality assurance , treatment data ) . These data use conjunction evidence exist literature expert opinion inform construction decision analytic model . Participating centre ask provide data contour CT data set sent participating centre . Following , dosimetry component require centre recruit many prospective patient possible collect mention data . Due short time frame , 30 prospective patient recruit time frame , supplement retrospective case . In addition , data collect 150 nasopharynx patient ask complete QoL patient cost questionnaire . Study Protocol D IGRT versus non IGRT Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer : The IGRT study methodology applies ANROTAT framework include series component study include dosimetric evaluation , QoL/toxicity evaluation , healthcare resource usage . This involve collection data 30 prospective patient . Data collection include eligibility , adverse events/toxicity , QoL , patient cost , dosimetry parameter . These data use conjunction evidence exist literature expert opinion inform construction decision analytic model . Data collect directly patient include QoL toxicity data well cost incur patient result treatment .</detailed_description>
