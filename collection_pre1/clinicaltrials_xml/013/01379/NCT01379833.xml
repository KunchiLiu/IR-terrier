	<brief_summary>Chronic inflammatory demyelinate polyradiculoneuropathy ( CIDP ) demyelinate chronic progressive relapse neuropathy believe secondary autoimmune response peripheral nerve antigens.5 We observe two patient CIDP decrease corneal sensation also suffer neurotrophic corneal ulcer severe visual loss affect eye . We want explore relationship CIDP corneal sensitivity . Our hypothesis people CIDP decrease corneal sensation compare without . We plan perform prospective study measure corneal sensation patient ( propose n=10 ) CIDP without determine ( 1 ) difference exist patient CIDP compare control ( 2 ) magnitude difference . If difference detect corneal sensitivity patient CIDP , awareness amongst physicians patient may help prevent blind complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Decreased Corneal Sensation Patients With Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The prevalence CIDP range 0.8 8.4 per 100 000.5 This broad range may reflect use different diagnostic criterion , recently confirm epidemiologic study UK population . Over 50 % patient may temporary severe disability course disease approximately 10 % eventually become persistently disabled die illness . CIDP may affect nerve plexus body . However , diagnostic criterion lean towards nerve conduction study limbs denervation organ system might overlook . Sensory innervation cornea provide ophthalmic branch trigeminal nerve via anterior ciliary nerve . A relatively small number ( 50-450 ) primary sensory neuron ipsilateral trigeminal ganglion send peripheral axon cornea branch extensively within corneal tissue . To maintain corneal transparency , peripheral axon corneal neuron lose myelin sheath enter corneal stroma . Fibers spread radial fashion parallel corneal surface.1 Our propose study explore relationship decrease corneal sensation , potentially devastate eye condition secondary CIDP . Decreased corneal sensation may lead neurotrophic keratitis ; describes corneal disease due impairment loss corneal sensation lead epithelial defect corneal ulcer . This may cause many ocular systemic disease Diabetes Stroke . Corneal innervation important maintenance corneal structure function , provide protective mechanism factor might potentially damaging cornea . Innervation also play important trophic function corneal repair relation disease , trauma surgery . Denervation decrease corneal sensitivity associate impairment epithelial endothelial cell function , increase epithelial endothelial permeability , decrease cell migration cell mitosis . In addition , denervated cornea predispose epithelial stromal abnormality , recurrent erosion , impair wound heal infection.2 Although corneal nerve lose myelin sheath enter stroma , association demyelinate disease affect nerve exclude . This may trigeminal nerve affect different level ( nucleus pons , Gasserian ganglion , trigeminal ophthalmic branch , nasociliary nerve , long ciliary nerve ) . Also , nerve without central myelin throughout length affect CIDP . For example , CNVIII peculiar myelin central myelin majority length , except short distal segment peripheral myelin.6 There one case report correlate finding hear loss vestibular dysfunction 6-year period patient CIDP . OUR STUDY We plan prospective clinical trial compare prevalence decrease corneal sensation possible decrease corneal nerve patient CIDP previously diagnose clinical feature electrophysiologic data outline American Academy Neurology10 compare patient without CIDP . Patients categorize accord severity disease duration per medical record . Exclusion criterion aim condition may reduce corneal sensation previous eye trauma , surgery , contact lens use , eye drop use , previous viral infection eye . A routine complete eye exam perform along additional test corneal sensation use standard method . If significant finding obtain initial eye exam , subject obtain in-vivo confocal image second site image corneal nerve fiber . Published standard corneal sensitivity well corneal nerve fiber density via confocal imaging use statistical analysis . SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDY Experimental evidence indicate impairment corneal sensory nerve induces pathological change anatomic integrity function cornea , particularly epithelium . Loss corneal sensory innervation lead decrease thickness corneal epithelium , intracellular swelling , loss microvilli abnormal production basal lamina . This may lead impairment vitality , metabolism , mitosis epithelial cell , consequently , epithelial breakdown . Persistent epithelial defect may lead chronic ulceration eventually compromise ocular surface component severe visual impairment . If association find CIDP decrease corneal sensation , study first one demonstrate association . An increased awareness among physician association may lead careful eye exam patient CIDP detection early change ocular disease may treat earlier serious blind complication avoid . FUTURE STUDIES If positive association find CIDP decrease corneal sensation , latter may add supportive criterion grade severity CIDP . CIDP many treatment modality available accord severity clinical course . Finding decreased corneal sensation CIDP patient prospectively may lead diagnosis increased disease severity patient may benefit aggressive treatment .</detailed_description>
