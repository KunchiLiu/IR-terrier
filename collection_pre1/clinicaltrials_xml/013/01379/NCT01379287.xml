	<brief_summary>Iso-fludelone type chemotherapy drug call epothilone . Epothilones drug attach protein body call `` tubulins '' . Tubulins help cell grow , find normal cancer cell . When research animal cancer give study drug , Iso-fludelone , drug attach `` tubulin '' slow stop cancer cell grow . Other type epothilones test cancer patient find safe . A similar epothilone drug drug call taxanes currently approve FDA treat certain type cancer . The purpose study see effect , good and/or bad , investigational drug , Iso-fludelone , cancer . The term `` investigational '' mean study drug test approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) regulatory agency . This study first time investigator use iso-fludelone people . This Phase I study . In Phase I study , first people receive drug give fairly low dose .</brief_summary>
