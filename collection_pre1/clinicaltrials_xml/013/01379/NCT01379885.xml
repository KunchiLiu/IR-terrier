	<detailed_description>Berberich Landman conduct randomized clinical trial demonstrate efficacy multimodal distraction technique reduce immunization distress ( RID ) 4-6 year old child receive pre-kindergarten immunization . Widespread implementation would require few step reduction personnel current study address practical time personnel limitation method . The current RID trial proposes randomize design compare current method , standard technique , ( ST ) , minimally alter approach arm grip rub adjacent injection site perform medical assistant conduct injection , substitute non-commercially available 'arm gripper ' . Pressure rub stimuli injection site document equally effective . The ST compare parental participation technique , ( PPT ) , whereby parent participate delivery pain-relieving intervention lieu second medical assistant . The primary aim present proposal compare effectiveness feasible PPT ST reduce pain distress childhood immunization . A secondary aim evaluate impact parental involvement parent child satisfaction immunization experience .</detailed_description>
