	<brief_title>An Evaluation Self-contained Direct Digital Radiography System Breast Specimen Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specimen image accept method evaluate tissue specimen obtain either minimally-invasive breast needle biopsy ( MIBB ) breast surgery . Specimen image use confirm target sample adequacy radiographically apparent breast abnormality . Specimen image acquire compare routine diagnostic imaging provide radiographic evidence index lesion adequately target sample ( case MIBB ) target remove adequate margin [ case breast surgical specimen ( BSS ) ] . Specimen image also provide guidance histopathologist evaluate breast specimen . Near real-time image acquisition , review feedback essential specimen image . The patient typically remain compression biopsy table MIBB anesthesia BSS clinician confirmation index abnormality adequately sample ( case MIBB ) surgically excise . For reason , digital technique favor analog ( film ) counterparts immediacy image acquisition transfer display radiologist review . Image quality speed critical factor specimen image . High resolution image clinical requirement delineate feature extent mass lesion , presence extent microcalcifications . Conventional full-field digital ( FFDM ) mammographic equipment locate mammography department one accept approach specimen image . An advantage method license skilled mammographic technologist assures adequate exposure specimen . However , method require FFDM system free time specimen arrive mammography department , interfere mammogram schedule . In case BSS , use conventional FFDM system additionally require transport specimen mammography department , add significant time patient anesthesia . Another mode specimen radiography self-contained digital radiography specimen image system locate mammography department Operating Room ( intraoperative ) . The use self-contained digital system free conventional mammography system intend purpose , provide clinician speed digital radiography . It show intraoperative imaging significantly reduce amount time patient anesthesia . Although , self-contained digital radiography specimen image system provide advantage speed , result image may suffer image quality despite availability intraoperative self contain system , many clinician choose transfer specimen mammography department image conventional FFDM system . Current specimen radiography system employ indirect digital technique , two step conversion , incoming x-ray signal convert light digital signal . The intermediate step convert signal light , lead diffusion scatter many pixel turn lead degradation fine feature mass density microcalcifications . Direct Digital technique another method currently use breast imaging . The direct digital technique advantage convert incoming signal directly digital signal , avoid intermediary light conversion phase indirect exposure . The direct digital process result well use incoming signal great resolution thus sharp image , provide high resolution minute feature associate mass lesion microcalcifications . Another common characteristic current self-contained system use `` stitch '' many small CMOS chip create large image detector . This type tile provide economical system , shear effect , gap chip overall concern calibration multiple chip significantly degrade image quality . All digital image , indirect direct acquire raw state process allow review . While image processing improve change raw aspect image acquisition , process improve visibility feature available image . Image process fundamentally associate image acquisition technique . If image adequately expose , image processing optimally applied case fail , require additional imaging .</detailed_description>
