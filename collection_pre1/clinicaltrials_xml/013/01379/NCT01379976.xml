	<brief_summary>Study objectives Primary : To compare toxicity free survival patient treat ALC ( acetylcarnitine ) plus cisplatin-containing chemotherapy ( CHT ) versus treat placebo plus cisplatin-containing chemotherapy . Secondary : To compare progression free survival , overall survival , compliance treatment , number episode grade 3-4 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , version 3.0 , neurotoxicity , well proportion patient experience grade 2-3-4 National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events , neuropathic pain intensity , clinical sign and/or symptom ( burn , numbness , itch , etc . ) sensorial neuropathy two treatment arm . Study design Multicentre , randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled , phase III , superiority study patient advance metastatic NSCLC ( non small cell lung cancer ) . Patients screen study inclusion decision start cisplatin-containing treatment already take context clinical practice . The type cisplatin-based treatment fix , single investigator free choose single patient among already approve first line treatment advance metastatic NSCLC . Patients meet eligibility criterion randomize 1 : 1 ratio receive ALC + cisplatin-containing CHT Placebo + cisplatin-containing CHT patient refusal , disease progression , unacceptable toxicity death . The study conduct Italy approximately 20 investigational center order recruit 650-675 subject 30-month period . Both efficacy safety data collect . Follow-up accord clinical practice . Data capture continue , patient , death study closure .</brief_summary>
