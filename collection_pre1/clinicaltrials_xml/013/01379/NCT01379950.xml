	<brief_summary>There grow body evidence suggest resolution inflammatory reaction active process . This process require signal turn early inflammatory stage , neutrophil infiltration promote resolution phase , clearance apoptotic cell . In array , relationship neutrophil , monocyte , macrophage crucial concert process . Macrophages possess plasticity phenotype explain protective well potentially detrimental role chronic inflammation tissue injury . Such heterogeneity arises macrophage differentiate monocyte expose specific tissue- hematopoietic cell-derived stimulus . It important able identify different type macrophage set . Today 's literature distinguish 3 main phenotypic group macrophage . The classically activate M1 macrophage , alternatively activated-M2 macrophage `` resolution phase '' - rMs macrophage . The third phenotypic macrophage might play crucial rule resolution phase , call `` resolving macrophage '' . All pro-resolving lipid mediator promote return tissue homeostasis . The investigator hypothesis periodontal patient inflammatory process continue process reach resolution phase , milieu , macrophage might key component . Within overall concept periodontal disease model inflammatory disease stoppable inflammatory reaction , primary aim study check macrophage characteristic periodontal patient compare healthy people .</brief_summary>
