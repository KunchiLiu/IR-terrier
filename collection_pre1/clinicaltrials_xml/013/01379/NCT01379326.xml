	<brief_summary>Objectives : The overall objective monitor efficacy mebendazole ( MBZ ) Soil-Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) . The primary objective : ( 1 ) monitor efficacy single dose 500 mg mebendazole ( MBZ ) Soil-Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) infection mean Faecal Egg Count Reduction ( FECR ) Cure Rate ( CR ) . The secondary objective : 1. ass occurrence Necator americanus Ancylostoma duodenal . 2. assess occurrence β-tubulin mutation related resistance drug administration . 3. evaluate role dog pig reservoir zoonotic transmission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective : Following obtain informed consent , schoolchildren target age range group recruit ask provide recent stool sample ( interval less 4 hour ) process determine Faecal Egg Count ( FEC ) Soil-Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) present . For initial sample aim enroll least 250 infected child least one Soil-Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) . This sample size select base statistical analysis study power , use random simulation correlate over-dispersed Faecal Egg Count data reflect variance-covariance structure selection real Faecal Egg Count ( FEC ) data set . This analysis suggest sample size 200 individual ( α = 0.05 , power = 80 % ) require detect 10 percentage point drop null efficacy ~ 80 % ( mean percentage FEC ∆ per individual ) wide range infection scenario . Standard power analysis proportion also indicate detection ~10 percentage point drop null cure rate require sample size 200 ( large sample require detect departure null efficacy around 50 % ) . Given anticipated non-compliance rate 25 % , sample 250 infected subject therefore consider necessary study site . All child provide stool sample treat mebendazole ( MBZ ) single table 500mg supervision ( chew + water ) . The mebendazole ( MBZ ) provide ( free ) coordinate group . Seven fourteen day ( maximum interval ) treatment second faecal sample collect child determine FEC . Subjects unable provide stool sample follow-up , experience severe concurrent medical condition diarrhea time first sampling , exclude study . Secondary objective : In 5 study site , faecal sample 100 infected subject preserve treatment mebendazole ( MBZ ) one tube ( 1 gram 10 ml 70 % ethanol ) . Samples child also preserve one tube ( 1 gram 10 ml 70 % ethanol ) treatment . Samples send Laboratory Parasitology , Ghent University . The sample , collect treatment subsequently examine molecular assay occurrence Necator americanus/Ancylostoma duodenal occurrence β-tubulin mutation relate resistance . The sample collect treatment subsequently examine molecular assay assess role animal reservoir human Soil-Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) . Parasitological technique , determination Faecal Egg Count Soil-Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) . All fecal sample process use McMaster egg count technique detection enumeration infection A. lumbricoides , T. trichiura hookworm . All study sit familiar technique McMaster slide provide previously . Molecular assay ( Laboratory Parasitology , Ghent University ) Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) extraction . DNA Soil-Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) extract sample preserve ethanol 70 % use Qiagen mini stool kit . Molecular identification Soil-Transmitted Helminths ( STH ) . The presence Soil-Transmitted Helminths specie : Ascaris ( n= 2 ) , Trichuris ( n = 2 ) hookworm ( n = 4 ) assess use different molecular assay . For differentiation Trichuris specie , species-specific polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) apply . For differentiation Ascaris canine hookworm PCR-Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) use . For human hookworm , quantitative PCR apply . Presence mutation β-tubulin related mebendazole ( MBZ ) resistance This specific objective perform collaboration McGill University ( Canada ) . Statistical analysis . Both Cure Rate ( CR ) Faecal Egg Count Reduction ( FECR ) consider monitor efficacy mebendazole ( MBZ ) Soil-Transmitted Helminths . The statistical analysis assess describe Vercruysse et al. , 2011 .</detailed_description>
