	<brief_summary>This study determine relevancy clinical scale outcome measure compare flexion angle gait measure . Clinical outcome measure form Knee Society Score WOMAC Score obtain patient . Gait data also obtain total knee replacement ( TKR ) patient pre-operative post-operative time . Gait data measure unaffected normal control second baseline . The hypothesis subject clinical outcome measure accurately reflect gait dependent outcome amd functional performance total knee replacement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Clinical Outcomes Performance Total Knee Replacement Patients Before After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients schedule undergo unilateral total knee replacement ( TKR ) surgery subject study . A control group Healthy volunteer , serve control group . The control group match close possible age gender TKR group . Both pre post-operative ( 3 week , 6 , 9 12 month follow-up ) measurement perform TKR group . A Intelligent Device Energy Expenditure Activity ( IDEEA ) use record body motion , sensor IDEEA device place patient secure adhesive tape ( allergic ) IDEEA device properly place patient , measure calibrate start . The patient require perform task , walk normal pace approximately 100 foot level surface , walk moderate incline ramp , climb stairs 7 8 step , sit rise two chair . Parameters measure subject , knee flexion angle ( walk , stair climb sit ) , velocity ( walk stair climb ) , Stride length ( walk ) , Energy ( walk , stair climbing , sit ) , parameter add need .</detailed_description>
