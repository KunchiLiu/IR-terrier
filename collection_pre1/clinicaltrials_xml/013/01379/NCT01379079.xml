	<brief_summary>Aspirin cornerstone secondary prevention cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) usually take awakening , although evidence regard optimal time intake lacking . Recent study healthy subject mild hypertension show aspirin bedtime decrease blood pressure ( -7/5mmHg ) , whereas intake aspirin awakening . Additionally , investigator find aspirin bedtime decrease plasma renin activity , catecholamine cortisol 24hrs . Time-dependent effect aspirin never study patient CVD , may use concomitant antihypertensive drug . Moreover , platelet reactivity circadian rhythm , intake aspirin bedtime may attenuate morning peak platelet reactivity . The investigator hypothesize aspirin intake bedtime compare awaken decrease blood pressure platelet reactivity 24h . A randomized open-label blind endpoint crossover trial 250 patient , recruit primary care , include use aspirin secondary prevention CVD stable blood pressure 149/94mmHg low . Study subject randomly use aspirin awaken bedtime two intervention period three month . Blood pressure record 24hrs end treatment period patient ' normal daily situation . To assess effect platelet inhibition , thromboxane-B2 level measure 24h urine sample end treatment period . The investigator asses differential effect accord time intake gastrointestinal complaint potential minor bleeding event , well compliance . The aim study evaluate effect aspirin take bedtime compare awaken blood pressure subject stable CVD . In addition , generate insight effect aspirin platelet reactivity 24hrs , potential side effect compliance .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aspirin Reduction Tension II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aspirin cornerstone secondary prevention cardiovascular disease inhibitory effect platelet aggregation . It reduce risk recurrent cardiovascular event quarter . Although supported evidence , aspirin usually take morning . There several reason may beneficial take aspirin bedtime instead awaken . First , one important modifiable risk factor cardiovascular disease arterial hypertension . Aspirin usually assume effect blood pressure . However , two randomize clinical trial Hermida et al . among ( otherwise healthy ) grade I hypertensive subject ( 140/90-159/99 mmHg ) , aspirin intake bedtime decrease 24h blood pressure 6.8/4.6 7.2/4.9 mmHg , whereas use aspirin morning slightly increase blood pressure ( 2.6/1.6 1.3/0.8 mmHg ) . The investigator demonstrate aspirin bedtime decrease plasma renin activity 24h excretion catecholamine cortisol 24h urine compare morning intake . Decreased activity pressor system form biologically plausible explanation find aspirin bedtime may reduce blood pressure whereas aspirin morning . The effect aspirin bedtime versus awaken blood pressure never study clinically relevant group patient , i.e . patient already use aspirin secondary prevention recurrent atherothrombotic event mostly use also wide variety concomitant ( antihypertensive ) drug . If time intake effect , could lead simple improvement therapy extra cost . Second , convincingly show morning peak platelet reactivity , might partly explain increase cardiovascular event early morning ( high incidence 6 12 AM ) . Coming upright posture lead increase platelet activity platelet also stimulate early morning increase sympathetic activity ( start hour awaken ) . Since platelet reactivity circadian rhythm , time intake aspirin may influence inhibitory effect platelet . It argue intake aspirin bedtime could better prevent early morning increase platelet reactivity intake morning assume intake morning would late . The aim project study whether treatment aspirin bedtime compare intake morning additional benefit patient use aspirin prevent recurrent cardiovascular event . Our primary objective study effect 100 mg aspirin intake bedtime compare 100 mg aspirin intake morning blood pressure ( 24h ambulatory blood pressure measurement ( ABPM ) ) patient use aspirin secondary prevention recurrent atherothrombotic event . As secondary objective , investigator study effect aspirin intake bedtime compare morning platelet function . Furthermore , investigator address differential effect potential side effect compliance , well potential effect modification effect blood pressure gene involve blood pressure regulation .</detailed_description>
