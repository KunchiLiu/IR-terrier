	<brief_summary>Patients severe infection initially require large amount fluid part resuscitation . Later however , problem may arise excess fluid increase time ventilator kidney damage . The amount fluid patient difficult ass . One approach determine amount fluid present large central vein . This do physical examination jugular vein , place catheter within vein . Unfortunately method unreliable predict amount fluid patient . Bioimpedance analysis ( BIA ) , device determine amount fluid body measure body 's electrical property . It quick painless test ass volume . The primary objective study determine BIA measurement associate patient important outcome time ventilator , risk kidney failure require dialysis death . We also determine whether BIA measure fluid status ICU patient . This study assess feasibility establish multi-centre study assess BIA 's role predict adverse outcome thereby prognosis fluid status . We hypothesize short vector length associate hypervolemia less ventilator free day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioimpedance Analysis Septic Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Objective : Persistent hypervolemia follow initial resuscitative phase sepsis show predict morbidity mortality . In patient sepsis intensive care unit ( ICU ) fluid accumulation associate significant increase duration ventilation , development acute kidney injury ( AKI ) require dialysis increase ICU length stay . It essential able identify characterize transition necessary fluid resuscitation harmful fluid volume accumulation . However , current method assess volume status ICU imprecise . Bioelectric impedance analysis ( BIA ) offer well establish easy perform bedside technique volume assessment . Our main objective prospectively determine bio-impedance derive measure associate patient important outcome include ventilator free day , AKI require dialysis overall mortality septic ICU patient . In addition , also ass whether BIA derive measure volume associate measure volume status . Hypothesis # 1 : Bio-impedance derive measure ( phase angle , vector length ) predict ventilator-free day day 30 composite outcome ICU patient AKI require dialysis overall mortality . Aim # 1 : To assess whether change bio-impedance vector length ( measure volume status ) day 3 day 7 post- admission ICU predict ventilator-free day day 30 . Secondary outcome mortality , AKI length stay ICU . Hypothesis # 2 : BIA derive volume measure ( vector length RXc graph method ) associate clinical , invasive biochemical measure volume status Aim # 2 : To determine BIA derived volume measure associated measure volume status include central venous pressure , N- brain natriuretic peptide ( N-BNP ) physical examination finding . Relevance : Chronic fluid overload state ICU patient associated adverse clinical outcome include prolonged ventilation , mortality , AKI increase length stay ICU . However current method inadequate ass volume status accurately . This pilot observational study determine whether implementation bio-impedance useful identifying volume overload ICU patient sepsis . We plan investigate whether correlation exists change vector length day 3 7 post admission ICU important patient outcome ventilator free day within first 30 day post-enrollment . This study assess feasibility inform large multi-centre observational trial adequately powered evaluate volume overload state determine bioimpedance ICU patient systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) patient-important outcome .</detailed_description>
