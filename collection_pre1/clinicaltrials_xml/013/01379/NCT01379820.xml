	<brief_title>Use Orotracheal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) Newborns With Respiratory Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent advance intensive care newborn closely related evolution management respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) frequently associate lung immaturity specially premature infant well various pathological condition mature lung full- term baby . The method ventilatory assistance treat condition vary continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) conventional mechanical ventilation and/or high frequency ventilation . It reasonable assume type ventilatory assistance provide infant grade accordance severity respiratory problem ( 1 ) therefore mode respiratory support one providing adequate ventilatory assistance result minimal volu barotrauma . Currently investigator know best ventilatory technique one stabilizes Po2 , Pco2 Ph avoids volu barotrauma , diminish possibility pulmonary injury shortens time spend hospital . It demonstrate use CPAP need mechanical ventilation less possibility pulmonary injury length hospital stay shorten ( 1 ) ( 2 ) . The need use mechanical ventilation increase gestational age marginal presence severe pulmonary pathology cause increase respiratory problem turn enhances possibility increase alveolar oxygen tension gradient ( A-a DO2 ) 180mmHg cause presence severe hyaline membrane syndrome evidence sequential chest X ray ( 8 ) . This also limit need early nasal continuous airway pressure ( ENCPAP ) . Other limit factor could pressure change due physiological event cry , mouth open close , cough hippus . In past use CPAP generate ventilator administer via endotracheal cannula ; however method ventilation abandon due high risk barotrauma due surge pression close , rigid , system could eventually generate increased resistance due disparity caliber endotracheal tube trachea ( 9 ) . This increase resistance long time consider great limit risk use orotracheal CPAP particularly premature infant . According severity disease , best result obtain use low pressure , high pulmonary volume provide high frequency oscillatory ventilation ( HFOV ) conventional ventilation high positive end expiration pressure ( PEEP ) ( 1 ) . The investigator want determinate rate pneumothorax , use oxygen 36 week gestational age , failure treatment , mortality , infection rate complication 3 method assist ventilation . The concept The Compensation Bag ( accessory lung ) : This concept base gregory original work 1972 ( 3 ) , investigator postulate air pressure close airway circuit always try find way escape , situation , weak point close circuit alveolus , therefore variation pressure directly reflect intrinsic alveolar pressure , , fall circuit pressure intra-alveolar pressure fall , cause turn decrease alveolar oxygen tension gradient cause collapse alveolar sac . On hand increase pressure airway circuit augment intra-alveolar pressure , distend sac , cause inflammatory change wall eventually rupture occasion air leakage long run give raise pathological sequel bronchopulmonary dysplasia . The compensation bag fit distensible mechanical valve interpose closed circuit , case increase pressure distention point bag alveolus . Also case decreased pressure point collapse bag therefore prevent collapse alveolar sac , allow maintain optimally expand alveolus without risk distention collapse . At time pulmonary resistance occasion endotracheal tube regulate within circuit thus improve performance mechanical ventilation well alveolar expansion adequate alveolar oxygen tension , avoid sudden pressure variation maintain benefit conventional CPAP keep constant alveolar volume regardless physiological event . In 1972 Gregory work report excellent evolution use anesthestic bag ventilation newborn , 2009 , investigator report small study modify gregory system excellent evolution . ( 4 ) work investigator want report use system baby .</detailed_description>
