	<brief_summary>- Rationale : The optimal preoperative medical management patient pheochromocytoma currently unknown . In particular , agreement respect whether phenoxybenzamine doxazosin optimal alfa-adrenoreceptor antagonist administer surgical resection pheochromocytoma . We hypothesize competitive alfa1-antagonist doxazosin superior non-competitive alfa1- alfa2-antagonist phenoxybenzamine . - Objective : comparing effect preoperative treatment either phenoxybenzamine doxazosin intraoperative hemodynamic control patient undergoing surgical resection pheochromocytoma . - Study design : Randomised control open-label trial . - Study population : 18 - 55 yr old . Adult patient recently diagnose benign pheochromocytoma . - Intervention : Patients randomise receive oral treatment either phenoxybenzamine doxazosin preoperatively . - Main study parameters/endpoints : The main study parameter define frequency intraoperative blood pressure episode outside predefined target range pretreatment either phenoxybenzamine doxazosin . In multicenter trial , compare effect two commonly use drug patient medically prepared resection benign pheochromocytoma . Participants subject experimental treatment kind , merely aim describe detail perioperative course general , particular , intraoperative hemodynamic control patient treat preoperatively either phenoxybenzamine doxazosin . A routine diagnostic work-up pheochromocytoma perform participant . One extra blood sample ( volume : 48,5 mL ) draw start study medication , participant need record symptom diary . In addition , patient pretreated outpatient clinic monitor blood pressure pulse rate home automate device . Treatment alfa-adrenoreceptor antagonist initiate least 2 - 3 week prior surgery . Patients admit hospital pretreatment alfa-adrenoreceptor antagonist blood pressure pulse rate measure nursing staff . The final site visit plan 30 day surgery , line current practice .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION AND RATIONALE Pheochromocytoma ( PCC ) rare clinically important catecholamine secrete neuro-endocrine tumour typically arise adrenal gland . In addition , neuro-endocrine tumour also originate chromaffin cell sympathetic ganglion ( 1 ) ( 2 ) . In protocol , PCC refer adrenal extra-adrenal chromaffin tumour hypersecretion catecholamine ( i.e . norepinephrine and/or epinephrine ) . The annual incidence rate US population estimate 1-2 case per 100,000 adult individual ( 3 ) . Data incidence prevalence PCC Netherlands publish . Based Dutch registry pathology diagnosis ( PALGA ) , find incidence 117 case PCC year 2007 ( unpublished observation ) . PCCs may occur part autosomal dominant inherited tumor syndrome , cause germline mutation RET proto-oncogene ( Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 2 syndrome ) , VHL gene ( von Hippel-Lindau disease ) , NF1 gene ( Neurofibromatosis type 1 ) , one gene encode subunit mitochondrial complex II , also call succinate dehydrogenase ( SDHB , SDHC , SDHD ) ( 4 ) . PCCs term 'sporadic ' family history PCC negative . Overall , 25 % PCC patient harbour germline mutation . Notably , germline mutation one PCC susceptibility gene may also present significant number patient sporadic PCC , mutation rate vary 7.5 - 14.6 % population study ( 5-7 ) . Therefore , genetic testing recommend patient PCC ( 7 ) . Very recently , new PCC susceptibility gene describe , seem likely future research result discovery genetic mutation associate PCC ( 8 ) . PCC constitute surgically curable cause hypertension . Hypertension patient PCC either persistent paroxysmal , absent minority patient . It potentially life-threatening disease high risk cardiovascular complication myocardial infarction , arrhythmia , cardiomyopathy , stroke pulmonary edema ( 1 ) . The clinical picture result release catecholamine tumour . This release evoke stimulus would normally pose hazard , surgery general anaesthesia . Thus , preoperative treatment alpha-adrenoceptor antagonist usually recommend prevention serious potentially fatal complication ( 9 ) . In one large surgical series report far , perioperative mortality morbidity 2.4 % 23.6 % , respectively ( 10 ) . According literature , 10 % patient PCC normotensive ( 1 ) . A normal blood pressure diagnosis relatively frequent among carrier one aforementioned germline mutation , individual subject periodic biochemical screen presence PCC . It demonstrate intraoperative hemodynamic instability adrenalectomy PCC occur extent MEN2a patient ( normotensive ) patient without MEN2a ( hypertensive ) ( 11 ) . Thus , preoperative treatment alpha -adrenoceptor antagonist also recommend normotensive patient PCC ( 9,11 ) , Historically , noncompetitive nonselective alpha -adrenoceptor antagonist phenoxybenzamine drug choice ( 12 ) . Alternatively , doxazosin - competitive selective alpha 1-adrenoceptor antagonist - might least effective asphenoxybenzamine few side effect . Notably , suggest doxazosin result significant clinically relevant reduction postoperative hypotension ( 13 ) . Severe postoperative hypotension necessitates admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) , volume resuscitation norepinephrine administer strict monitoring hemodynamics . Data optimal preoperative pharmacological management patient PCC conflict . For example , recent study report comparable effect phenoxybenzamine doxazosin intraoperative hemodynamic control ( 14 ) .This study , however , retrospective design therefore affect several confound factor lack randomisation , non-standardised intraoperative care , use historical control . Until , prospective randomise controlled trial compare phenoxybenzamine doxazosin conduct . Thus , preoperative drug therapy choice remain unresolved issue , recent international PCC symposium conclude specific recommendation make subject ( 9 ) . We perform survey among university medical center Netherlands , show almost half center prescribe phenoxybenzamine , whereas center use doxazosine preoperative drug choice patient PCC ( 15 ) . Usually , drug administer 2-3 week surgery . This preoperative medical preparation take place either outpatient inpatient clinic , depend patient-related factor ( e.g . disease severity , geographical consideration ) local experience . Preoperative volume expansion recommend patient PCC ( 9 ) . The rationale behind recommendation base notion PCC associate decreased intravascular volume , restore influence treatment alpha -adrenoceptor antagonist . Without administration volume expansion severe hypotension might ensue . Therefore , common practice advise liberal salt intake alpha -adrenoceptor antagonist therapy administer saline infusion ( e.g . 2L NaCL 0.9 % 24 hour ) shortly surgery ( 9,15 ) . Several drug , include certain anaesthetic , may evoke uncontrolled catecholamine release result severe hemodynamic instability ( 16 ) . Patients advise carry document enlist medication contra-indicated case PCC . There consensus optimal anaesthetic management resection PCC , randomise control trial subject available ( 16,17 ) . In survey anaesthetic management PCC Netherlands , find many different protocol number hospital ( =10 ) respond ( include university medical center ; unpublished observation ) . PRESCRIPT represent first randomise control trial compare effect pretreatment either phenoxybenzamine doxazosin intraoperative hemodynamic control patient PCC . The relevance conduct trial describe study protocol recently express expert field PCC research ( 18 ) . In addition , PRESCRIPT provide unique opportunity prospectively collect data contain detailed information item present symptom sign , perioperative outcome result biochemical , image genetic study patient PCC . Of interest , result study expected direct impact national international guideline regard perioperative care patient PCC . 2 . OBJECTIVES Primary Objective : The primary objective determine two commonly use drug preoperative management provide best intraoperative hemodynamic control patient undergoing resection PCC . Secondary Objective ( ) : - identify determinant intraoperative hemodynamic control . Potential determinant : gender age patient , clinical set preoperative management ( i.e . outpatient inpatient clinic ) , preoperative level , catecholamine N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) PCC size , sporadic hereditary PCC , - describe prospectively symptoms sign PCC large cohort patient . Note : , data symptom sign describe retrospectively - describe prospectively result several diagnostic technique - ass prospectively distribution sporadic hereditary PCC large cohort Dutch patient - build biobank blood tissue sample future study PCC 3 . STUDY DESIGN Randomised open-label control trial .</detailed_description>
