	<brief_summary>Women antibody proteins call SSA/Ro SSB/La face 2 % chance child life threaten heart condition regardless whether active lupus , remission , vague symptom . This heart problem refer congenital heart block ( serious third degree complete block ) represent damage think caused autoantibody . The heart beat abnormally slowly almost child require permanent pacemaker age 20 . Importantly , woman one child heart block ten-fold high risk another child heart condition . Unfortunately , even close monitoring special technique pregnancy reverse complete heart block observe . Thus , treatment aim prevention critical . This study evaluate first time whether hydroxychloroquine , drug use many patient SLE , prevent development heart condition . Data laboratory experiment suggest drug , cross placenta , may decrease inflammation initiate passage anti-Ro antibody fetus . The study use Simon 's 2-Stage design , plan enroll 19 patient Stage 1 35 patient Stage 2 Stage 1 successful . Patients already hydroxychloroquine start soon pregnancy confirm . The hope few 3 case heart block occur Stage 1 , few 6 case occur 54 patient Stage 2 reach . The result study expect become integral part counsel woman anti-Ro/La antibody consider pregnancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventive Approach Congenital Heart Block With Hydroxychloroquine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One strong clinical association autoantibody direct component Ro/La ribonucleoprotein complex development congenital heart block ( CHB ) offspring , alarm prospect face 2 % primigravid mother reactivity . The risk 10-fold high woman previously affect child . Despite attempt large multicenter study forestall disease serial utero monitoring , irreversible block extensive myocardial injury document within 7 day normal rhythm PR interval . CHB associate substantial mortality morbidity . Two recent prospective study ( 20 mother U.S. 15 Europe ) utilize identical protocol IVIG replacement dos demonstrate 1 ) intervention prevent recurrence CHB 2 ) recurrence rate 17-18 % robust 3 ) recruitment patient feasible . During time period IVIG trial , basic science explore pathogenesis disease support notion Toll Like Receptor ( TLR ) signal follow ligation ssRNA ( hY3 ) complexed Ro protein contribute fibrosis . This observation lead vitro study address inhibition endosomal acidification chloroquine subsequent translation patient evaluate use hydroxychloroquine ( HCQ ) extensive retrospective chart review . The combined data suggest efficacy HCQ . Accordingly , goal study : To determine whether hydroxychloroquine use pregnancy prevents CHB high risk population . The trial open-label employ Simon 's 2-stage optimal design allow early stopping due absence treatment efficacy . The first stage require 19 subject . Despite rarity disease requirement previous CHB child , base US Research Registry Neonatal Lupus , proposal feasible . If 3 mother child 2nd 3rd degree CHB , study terminate first stage . If occur , fund seek enroll additional 35 mother second stage total 54 subject . Treatment consider efficacious few 6 mother 54 child advance CHB . With design , study 90 % power conclude hydroxychloroquine preventive true recurrence rate treatment 5 % . In addition , probability reject treatment study 95 % true recurrence rate 18 % . Serial echocardiogram ( monitor PR interval ) blood draw ( IFNƒÑƒnsignatures , antibody titer ) include protocol . The result study expect become integral part counsel woman anti-SSA/Ro-SSB/La antibody consider pregnancy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Mothers must antiRo and/or antiLa Ab document NYU immunology laboratory ( CLIAapproved ) , utilizes ELISA well reactivity ELISA least one three recombinant antigen ( 48La , 52Ro , 60Ro , JB laboratory ) . 2 . Mothers must previous child cardiac NL , define herein : presence heart block ( 1st , 2nd , 3rd degree ) document electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , echocardiogram , pacemaker , statement medical record , and/or ; presence cardiac injury , specifically include autopsy evidence mononuclear infiltrate endocardium , myocardium , pericardium and/or EFE echocardiogram always associate cardiac dysfunction . In PITCH , include woman prior child rash ; however , recent data generate RRNL suggest recurrence CHB follow rash 11 % , 18 % [ 34 ] . Thus , inclusion previous rash could lead falsely lowered recurrence rate , therefore exclude . 3 . Intrauterine pregnancy ≤10 week . 4 . Mother may take ≤20 mg prednisone , experience , CHB develop presence dose . 5 . Mother may asymptomatic , rheumatic disease SLE SS . Maternal health status consider influence development CHB . 6 . Mother may may already take HCQ . This latter point discuss Dr. Nathalie CostedoatChalumeau , publish extensively measurement HCQ . While might optimal mother anticipate enrollment study HCQ prior conception , impractical . Some may never achieve pregnancy want take HCQ unless conceive ( especially asymptomatic ) . On hand , woman SLE likely already HCQ would limit enrollment exclude patient must initiate HCQ enrollment first trimester . Although accepted dogma HCQ require several month maximal efficacy treat rheumatic disease , unknown whether would apply transplacental passage fetal level ( impossible measure ) . Dr. CostedoatChalumeau suggest HCQ probably three compartment model include circulation , tissue cell . In circulation , half life approximately 7 day tissue , 40 day . In Dr. CostedoatChalumeau 's experience , steady state blood level HCQ achieve 46 week . Thus , dose mother later 10 week gestation provide sufficient fetal exposure vulnerable period CHB generally accept span 1824 wks . Furthermore , placenta form HCQ gain access fetus may effective quickly biology consider . 1 . Mother Ab Ro La . 2 . Identification follow structural lesion consider causal CHB , i.e. , could account block fibrous disruption atrium AV node due absence penetrate bundle AV node : atrioventricular septal defect ; b ) single ventricle c ) developmental tricuspid valve disease ; ) Ltransposition great artery ; e ) heterotaxia . 3 . Mother take glucocorticoid . Although unlikely preventative , use steroid may confound interpretation result . The final point intense discussion center around whether another exclusion use HCQ first pregnancy CHB occur . While one could argue mother HCQ effective perhaps , assumption remain speculative thus prior absence efficacy HCQ constitute exclusion criterion .</criteria>
