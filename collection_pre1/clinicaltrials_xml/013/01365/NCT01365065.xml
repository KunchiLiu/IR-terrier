	<brief_title>Safety Effect HIV Transcription Vorinostat Patients Receiving Suppressive Combination Anti-retroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment HIV infection combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) lead significant improvement life expectancy quality life people live HIV . Nevertheless , life expectancy significantly low uninfected individual cART lead several long term side effect . cART alone able cure HIV infection due persistence HIV infection dormant cell . One potential strategy eradicate HIV infection 'wake ' dormant infect cell 'turning ' cell . The small number cell dormant infect would start produce virus die , infection cell would prevent cART . Ultimately could lead eradication dormant infect cell potential cure HIV . This study pilot study 20 individual recruit Alfred Hospital . The hypothesis vorinostat induce HIV transcription CD4 T-cells latent HIV infection , safe well tolerated patient receive effective cART induce histone acetylation vivo patient HIV infection . The study run 12 week , involve 9 study visit participant . Eligible patient must 18 60 year age confirm HIV infection , receive successful cART indicate 'suppressed ' HIV virus blood ( plasma HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml ) least 3 year strong immune system ( two CD4 count great 500 cell/µl last 6 month ) . Patients review screening day 1 ( three time point ) , 2 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 84 ( week 12 ) . They blood test HIV viral load assessment , CD4 cell count , biochemistry , hematology storage sample . An electrocardiogram heart ( ECG ) take screening , day 7 14 . As part study level HIV blood white blood cell degree cell 'turned ' ( histone ( H3 ) acetylation ) measure 3 time point day 1 , day 2 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 . The level one component cART measure day 1 14 . At baseline day 14 sigmoidoscopy perform collection rectal biopsy . The safety well vorinostat tolerate determine base physical exam , laboratory test question problem patient may experience study . This study Independent Safety Monitoring Committee addition evaluate overall safety patient responsible assess safety first patient enrol prior recommendation continue study .</detailed_description>
