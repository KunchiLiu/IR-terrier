	<brief_summary>This phase I/II multicenter , open label , nonrandomized study patient Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) receive treatment carfilzomib place bortezomib use bortezomib-containing combination regimen MM patient progress receive . This study enroll 45 patient total . These patient resistant bortezomib demonstrate progressive disease bortezomib relapse within 12 week last dose bortezomib combination regimen . Patients sub-divided 2 group study , treatment contain ( Group A ) contain immunomodulatory drug ( IMiDs ) ( Group B ) . Thirty patient enrol Group A 15 patient Group B total 45 patient . Patients must receive 4 dos minimum 1.0 mg/m^2 bortezomib 4 week per cycle . Patients must receive least one cycle meeting definition show progressive disease consider eligible . Patients refractory relapse within 12 week last dose bortezomib recent bortezomib-containing regimen include either thalidomide lenalidomide eligible regardless patient receive regimen , long meet criterion . Carfilzomib subsequently replace bortezomib use patient 's recent bortezomib-containing regimen patient progress receive . Patients eligible progressed bortezomib alkylating agent ( melphalan cyclophosphamide ) , anthracycline ( doxorubicin pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ) and/or glucocorticosteroid ( prednisone , dexamethasone medrol ) IMiD ( thalidomide lenalidomide ) . The study consist screening period , follow eight open label treatment cycle , final assessment occur 28 day end last treatment cycle , follow-up period maintenance cycle single agent carfilzomib . Patient complete combination treatment period without progressive disease eligible maintenance therapy single-agent carfilzomib . During maintenance therapy carfilzomib administer dose give last cycle combination treatment .</brief_summary>
