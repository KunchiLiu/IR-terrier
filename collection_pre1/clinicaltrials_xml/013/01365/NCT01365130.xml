	<detailed_description>Gastric cancer second frequent cancer-related cause death lung cancer worldwide approximately 900,000 case per year . The incidence gastric cancer high East Asia , China Japan . In last two decade dramatic increase North America Europe adenocarcinoma distal esophagus GE junction indistinguishable proximal gastric cancer . Cabazitaxel ( XRP6258 ) semi-synthetic novel taxoid . Like traditional taxane drug , bind stabilizes tubilin structure result inhibition cold-induced microtubule depolymerization cell division subsequent inhibition tumor cell proliferation . This novel agent , however , poor affinity P-glycoprotein -- protein product multidrug resistance gene ABCB1 . P-glycoprotein membrane-associated drug efflux pump think potential cause taxane resistance tumor . Also unlike traditional taxanes , Cabazitaxel exhibit penetration blood-brain barrier ( BBB . ) Preclinical study demonstrate Cabazitaxel cytotoxic cell line acquire resistance doxorubicin , vincristine , vinblastine , paclitaxel docetaxel . Taxanes demonstrate statistically significant antitumor activity monotherapy part combination triplet regimens gastroesophageal carcinoma.Cabazitaxel emerge novel investigational semi-synthetic taxoid establish activity cell line refractory traditional taxanes preclinical study phase III study patient metastatic prostate cancer . Cabazitaxel , low affinity P-glycoprotein drug efflux pump , may demonstrate superior response rate docetaxel . Furthermore , demonstrate prostate cancer , cabazitaxel appear substantial activity patient previously treat docetaxel . Phase I II trial conduct demonstrate safety efficacy Cabazitaxel ( XRP6258 ) metastatic breast prostate cancer . Neutropenia primary dose-limiting toxicity recommend dose establish 20 25mg/m2 . The latter dose use TROPIC trial , pivotal phase III trial demonstrate improve overall survival median progression free survival patient hormone resistant prostate cancer refractory docetaxel receive Cabazitaxel plus prednisone versus receive mitaxantrone plus prednisone . Cabazitaxel give IV dose 25mg/m2 demonstrated safety anti-tumor efficacy phase I , II phase III trials The primary goal evaluate activity Cabazitaxel treatment advance gastroesophageal cancer progress least one line treatment metastatic disease . Activity define complete partial response . The investigator differentiate 10 % level activity 30 % level activity .</detailed_description>
