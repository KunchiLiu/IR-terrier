	<brief_summary>C-reactive protein ( CRP ) directly implicate atherogenesis associate cardiovascular morbidity patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Effective Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) treatment show gradually decrease CRP level thus consequently improve disease-related cardiovascular morbidity . However , influence gender CRP evolution pattern never assess . The aim study investigate possible gender difference CRP evolution OSA patient 3 6 month start effective CPAP treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OSA independent risk factor number cardiovascular disease . One important possible mechanism underlie cardiovascular disease patient OSA systemic inflammation . CRP , acute phase reactant secrete liver , one actively studied biomarkers low-grade inflammation , numerous study show high CRP level associate high mortality morbidity due cardiovascular disease men woman . In patient OSA , question whether CRP level elevate still debate . Although continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) effective management OSA , conflict data also exist regard effect CPAP CRP level . However , none exist study assess influence gender CRP evolution pattern . Therefore , aim study investigate possible gender difference CRP evolution patient moderate severe OSA , free medical comorbidities , 3 6 month start effective CPAP treatment .</detailed_description>
