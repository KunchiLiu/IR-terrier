	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial compare four different intravenous ( IV ) fluid treatment protocol pediatric diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) . Two rate rehydration compare ; rapid rate slower rate . Within two basic rehydration protocol , investigator vary type rehydration fluid use ( 0.9 % saline 0.45 % saline ) . The investigator compare different treatment conduct assessment neurological injury , measure frequency significant cerebral edema , measure long-term neurocognitive function . These study allow u determine whether variation IV fluid treatment protocol affect acute neurological outcome DKA . Additionally , provide important data regard impact DKA DKA treatment long-term neurocognitive function child . In way , investigator hope identify ideal fluid management strategy child DKA . Previous study suggest DKA may cause blood flow brain reduce brain injury might result reduction blood flow and/or effect re-establishment normal blood flow DKA treatment insulin iv fluid . The investigator hypothesize rapidly re-establishing normal blood flow brain DKA , give fluid rapidly use fluid high sodium ( salt ) content , help minimize brain injury cause DKA .</brief_summary>
