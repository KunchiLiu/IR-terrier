The EAR define acute fall FEV1 ≥20 percent within 2 hour follow allergen challenge . The LAR define fall FEV1 ≥15 percent 3 hour 7 hour follow allergen challenge patient someone investigator study personnel would expect conscientious cooperation duration study patient able execute obtain write informed consent Visit 1. current neuropsychiatric condition without drug therapy judge investigator clinically significant and/or affect patient 's ability participate clinical study . Such history Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) consider unstable investigator , pharmacotherapy require , i.e . Ritalin® , Adderall® , patient pharmacotherapy ≥1 month prior Visit 1 . The pharmacotherapeutic regimen remain stable conduct study history learn disability intellectual impairment opinion investigator prevent patient participate study impairment hepatic function include alcohol relate liver disease , cirrhosis , hepatitis , cancer , clinically significant hematologic , renal , endocrine ( except control diabetes mellitus , postmenopausal symptom , hypothyroidism ) , cardiovascular ( particularly coronary artery disease , arrhythmia , hypertension , congestive heart failure ) , neurologic ( include transient ischemic attack , stroke , seizure disorder , migraine headache ) , gastrointestinal disease clinically significant abnormality physical examination and/or laboratory test result ( include hematology chemistry panel , urinalysis ) assess investigator . The patient allow abnormality detect physical laboratory examination consider clinically significant investigator limit study 's conduct unless abnormality relate underlying asthma worsen asthma ( require daily use nebulized Beta2agonists use longacting Betaagonists ( LABA ) , require inpatient hospitalization asthma control , require emergency room treatment , require systemic corticosteroid asthma control ) respiratory infection 6 week precede Screening Visit use inhale ( &gt; 1 mg beclomethasone dipropionate [ BDP ] equivalents/day ) systemic ( intramuscular , intravenous , oral ) corticosteroid within 60 day prior Screening PreRandomization Evaluation visit use nasal inhaled corticosteroid ( ≤1 mg BDPequivalents/day ) , intraophthalmic corticosteroid , nasal , inhale , intraophthalmic cromolyn sodium nedocromil , leukotriene receptor antagonist ( zafirlukast , pranlukast , montelukast ) , 5lipoxygenase inhibitor ( zileuton ) within 4 week prior Screening PreRandomization Evaluation visit . Topical corticosteroid dermatologic use allow use antiimmunoglobulin E ( IgE ) therapy immunosuppressive within 3 month prior Screening PreRandomization Evaluation visit use immunotherapy within 3 month prior Screening PreRandomization Evaluation visit use oral intraophthalmic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent ( NSAIDs ) permit , within 48 hour PreRandomization Evaluation spirometry . Aspirin® use permit within 7 day PreRandomization Evaluation spirometry theophyllinecontaining agent type , LABA ( salmeterol , formoterol ) , longacting anticholinergic ( tiotropium ) permit within 1 week prior Screening PreRandomization Evaluation visit . Shortacting inhaled Beta2agonists inhale shortacting anticholinergic could use intermittently accord individual need , however , withhold least 8 hour conduct challenge spirometry use oral , intranasal , intraophthalmic antihistamine within 5 day prior Screening PreRandomization Evaluation visit use caffeinecontaining product ( chocolate , tea , caffeinated soda ) medication ( combination product caffeine , include butalbitalcodeineacetominophencaffeine , butalbitalacetominophencaffeine , dihydocodeineacetominophencaffeine , ergotaminecaffeine , hydrocodonechlorpheniraminephenylephrineacetominophencaffeine ) 12 hour , alcohol counter drug include cold allergy medication 48 hour , inhale bronchodilator 8 hour prior Screening PreRandomization Evaluation MCh allergen challenge spirometry herbal supplement nutraceuticals permit . However , vitamin allow patient smoker ( include cigarette , cigar , pipe , chew tobacco , cannabis , i.e . hashish , marijuana ) . Patients allow history smoking within past year total smoking history ≥2 packyears lung disease mild moderate asthma concomitant disease condition could interfere conduct study , treatment could interfere conduct study , would , opinion investigator , pose unacceptable risk patient study , include , limited , cancer , alcoholism , drug dependency abuse , psychiatric disease recent ( &lt; 1 year ) history alcohol dependency unable and/or unlikely comprehend and/or follow protocol duration study participation study involve investigational market product within 30 day prior entry study donate blood blood product transfusion 1 month prior initiation treatment study drug , time study surgery gastrointestinal tract could interfere drug absorption ( Note : This applicable minor abdominal surgery appendectomy herniorrhaphy ) severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality could increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration could interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , could make patient inappropriate entry study</criteria>
