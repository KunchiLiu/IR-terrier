	<brief_summary>This project mean show wether HBOT fasten recovery process surgical treatment distal Radius fracture . For propose microcirculation measure , together level pain visual analog scale ( VAS ) remain force hand surgery examine . Furthermore sonography contrast medium long establish examination organ parenchyma , meant verify muscular-skeletal system project .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Distal Radius Fractures : Can Shorten Recovery Time Increase Fracture Healing ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project investigate microcirculation skin , muscle bone surgical treatment distal Radius fracture without Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy detect benefit HBOT . In Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy patient breathes Oxygen mask pressure chamber high air pressure normal atmospheric pressure wich meant increase peripheric oxygen suppley heal tissue . The patient receive 10 session HBOT . The patient treat HBOT choose randomly . The microcirculation measure parameter tissue damage wind healing . It register O2c , work measure reflect lightwaves . It strictly noninvasive cause absolutely pain patient . The measurement device consist two small probe , simply stick patientÂ´s skin . There 8 measurement study : The first one shortly surgical treatment , one measuring appointment every week four week . Afterwards patient hand measure 6th , 8th 12th week surgical treatment . In measurement healthy side measure well comparison . Additional force fo hand level pain Visual Analogue Scale evaluate . Furthermore sonography contrast medium first week surgical treatment indicate increase blood suppley HBOT detect wound heal complication . Therefore study research one hand benefit HBOT often young healthy patient radius fracture return early easily health condition . On hand study mean establish sonography contrast medium examination method little risk .</detailed_description>
