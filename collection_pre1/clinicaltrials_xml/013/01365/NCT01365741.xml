	<brief_summary>The purpose study clarify wether body posture ingestion 60mg Efient , thrombocytic inhibitor , influence time thrombocytic inhibition . The study aim mimic treatment Danish patient receive admit hospital ST-elevation myocardial infarction since patient referee acute Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) necessitate fast efficient thrombocytic inhibition . Current guideline recommend administration Efient right PCI procedure , patient lying , either ambulance operating room . We , investigator , believe suboptimal patient , since sort prolong inhibition time possibly worsen patient prognosis make patient prone later clot issue . Our hypothesis making patient ingest tablet 90 degree upright position make sit 2 minute ingestion , effect pill commence faster take supine position . This possibly lead fast inhibition thrombocyte , believe lead low incidence clot issue procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study divide two session : first session control arm- ingestion Efient supine position . 14 day later , test-persons intervention- ingestion Efient sit upright 2 minute . Besides , second session exactly control arm .</detailed_description>
