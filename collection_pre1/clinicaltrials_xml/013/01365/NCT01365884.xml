	<brief_title>First-Sight Refractive Error Correction : Direct Comparison Autorefraction Results Children 7 18 Years Age</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uncorrected refractive error frequent cause visual impairment child prevalent rural underserved area global population . In 2006 , World Health Organization release global estimate visual impairment . According finding , approximately 314 million people world whose vision impair . Of population 90 % individual live develop country 153 million case believe due uncorrected refractive error . Children , age five 15 year , suffer refractive error ( mostly myopia , hyperopia , astigmatism ) improve normal vision . It estimate 2020 , approximately one third world 's population ( 2.5 billion ) affect myopia alone14 . The prevalence refractive error school-aged child significant especially impact child 's life term education development . Studies Western population collectively show myopia occur &lt; 5 % child 8 year younger . Sampling study country worldwide show high prevalence myopia among Southeast Asia child less among Australian children.1-11 Refractive error study Eastern Nepal find 2.9 % child vision 20/40 bad 56 % 200 eye test cause refractive error due myopia , hyperopia astigmatism.12 The challenge determine effective accessible method detect refractive error dispense spectacle good vision . Children access clinical setting typically receive prescriptive spectacle correct refractive error . However , underserved area standard eye care may absent , child unable receive benefit normal near normal vision . The challenge determine effective accessible method detect refractive error dispense spectacle good vision In clinical setting , refractive error correct prescribe spectacle contact lens daily basis . Typically patient first undergo autorefraction , computer-controlled machine objectively calculate refractive error present start point subjective refraction test . This machine , however , cumbersome easily transportable abroad . Typically machine hold patient 's forehead ask look machine distant object . While look object machine calculates refractive error . First-Sight simplify way correct refractive error . It easily portable , make accessible remote area world . Unlike study cite , First-Sight take remote area clinic available patient able afford pay clinic visit . As simplified technique , local health care worker may easily able learn use First-Sight dispense spectacle need . Lastly , sponsor First-Sight provide refract kit dispense custom-made spectacle cost health care worker child respectively .</detailed_description>
