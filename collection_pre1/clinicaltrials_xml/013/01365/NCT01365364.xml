	<brief_summary>Restless legs syndrome periodic limb movement ( PLM ) sleep-related movement disorder study show change striatal dopaminergic activity patient disorder . Physical exercise show improve symptom restless legs syndrome PLM , treatment dopamine agonist . However , mechanism physical exercise act non-pharmacological treatment improve symptom restless legs syndrome PLM remain unknown . The investigator evaluate dopamine transporter density profile 16 sedentary patient ( control experimental - PLM , group ) influence acute physical exercise concentration maximal exercise test . Each patient underwent baseline polysomnography evaluate sleep pattern PLM index value . After obtain polysomnography baseline , single photon emission computer tomography baseline determine . Subsequently , volunteer perform maximal exercise test morning , follow single photon emission computer tomography two hour later polysomnography night , assess effect acute physical exercise dopamine transporter sleep pattern . The result show significant low dopamine transporter baseline density striatum region experimental group . The result also show significant reduction periodic leg movement rate experimental group significant increase percentage stage-1 non-REM sleep group maximal exercise test . Significant difference group observe Stage 2 sleep slow wave sleep . Our result show patient PLM low dopamine transporter density leave putamen region compare control group acute physical exercise ( maximal exercise test ) alter profile , provide evidence improvement result chronic physical exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental Design Each volunteer ( control experimental group ) underwent Polysomnography ( PSG ) adaptation . After one week , baseline cerebral SPECT perform ( 1-3pm ) baseline PSG perform night evaluate sleep pattern PLM index . Subsequently ( one week ) , subject underwent maximal exercise test ( MET ) morning ( 11am 1pm ) SPECT examination perform afternoon ( 1-3 pm ) . A PSG perform night evaluate effect acute exercise DAT density sleep pattern ( Figure 1 ) .</detailed_description>
