Up 50 survivor cancer non-melanoma skin cancer , treat cancer MD Anderson , take part portion study . Pancreas Study : If participant agrees take part study , participant complete physical fitness test , questionnaire , train session 4 different time point : - Before surgery , either participant 's clinic visit phone . This session take 75 minute . - About 1 week participant discharge hospital follow surgery , study staff meet participant participant 's clinic appointment . This session take 30 minute . - About 4-7 week participant discharge hospital follow surgery , participant come clinic . This session take 45 minute . - Between 3 7 month surgery , study staff meet participant participant 's clinic appointment . This session take 45 minute . If participant physically able , participant also take part nutrition exercise program include strengthen exercise walk . Additionally , participant wear 2 activity monitor ; night , participant use weight scale electronic reporting system provide information participant 's physical activity , symptom , appetite . A study staff member get approval participant 's doctor doctor specialize physical medicine rehabilitation participant begin either exercise program ( walk strength ) describe study . At-Home Device Use Electronic Reporting System : Below information device report system participant use wear study : - Participant wear Fitbit monitor participant 's wrist day night start day participant receives monitor ( 4 week participant 's surgery ) participant 's final study visit ( 3-7 month participant 's surgery ) . Participant authorizes research staff receive data participant 's Fitbit start date participant 's study enrollment end participant complete study . When participant complete study , Fitbit participant 's keep . - Participant receive second activity monitor wear participant 's wrist 7 day begin 1 week participant discharge hospital surgery . After 7 day , participant return monitor use postage-paid envelope provide participant . - Participant receive weight scale weigh participant day start 1 week participant discharge hospital end participant 's final study visit ( 3-7 month participant 's surgery ) . Participant return scale u final study visit . At end day participant go bed , participant weigh participant use electronic reporting system report participant 's physical activity , symptom desire eat . Participant report information u either complete email survey use application upload participant 's personal phone . This take 5 minute day . Nutrition : A registered dietitian ( RD ) monitoring responses participant 's daily electronic report . If report indicate participant 's appetite unusually poor , RD contact participant provide nutrition counseling aim improve participant 's food nutrient intake . The length session determine participant 's need counseling . At-Home Exercise Program : A rehabilitation specialist study staff teach participant participant 's exercise program . An MD Anderson rehabilitation doctor oversee training . At participant 's first clinic visit participant discharge hospital , research staff discuss participant 's walk program participant . The program consist walk briskly 20-30 minute per day least 5 time week participant 's final study visit ( 3-7 month participant 's surgery ) . If participant unable walk brisk pace , participant ask walk slow pace . Between 4 7 week surgery , research staff discuss participant 's strengthening exercise program participant . The strengthening exercise do use resistance band . Participant ask perform exercise 30 minute least 2 time week . Participant also ask perform additional 5 minute stretch exercise time help prevent soreness . Strengthening certain muscle group help upper body control balance , study team believe may help participant 's ability move surgery . Also , strengthen shoulder , back , leg muscle important activity like get bed , important pancreas surgery . Physical Fitness Tests : Participant 's strength check use hand-held grip test . Participant 's walk speed check 6-minute walking test . Participant perform 3 test check function participant 's low body .

Questionnaires : Participant ask complete questionnaire participant 's physical ability , health , quality-of-life 3 time : ( 1 ) participant 's pancreatic surgery , ( 2 ) 4-7 week surgery , ( 3 ) 3-7 month surgery . Answering questionnaire take 20 minute time . About 1 week participant leave hospital participant 's surgery , participant complete physical ability quality-of-life questionnaire . This take 10 minute . Participant ask re-take quality-of-life questionnaire 7-10 day 4 time-points note . This take 7-10 minute time . Participant also ask complete questionnaire usefulness device participant use home . Participant complete questionnaire 2 time : first 1 week participant start use weight scale second 3-7 month participant 's surgery . Lean Body Mass Assessment : If computerize tomography ( CT ) scan perform part participant 's routine medical care , study staff look 3 scan estimate participant 's lean body mass . If available , study staff also look participant 's CT scan 3 time point : participant 's surgery , 4-7 week participant discharge hospital surgery , 3-7 month participant 's surgery . Equipment Provided Participant : During study , participant issue Fitbit wrist monitor , second activity monitor , weight scale , exercise band . When participant complete study , participant keep Fitbit wrist monitor exercise band . Participant return second activity monitor study team 7 day issue participant . Participant return weight scale study team end study . Other Medical Information : Information participant 's medical record collect stored electronic password-protected research database , accessible research staff . Length Study : Participant begin study prior participant 's pancreas surgery , may 4 week surgery . Participant continue device use , exercise nutrition program , evaluation 3-7 month participant 's surgery . If participant side effect disease get bad , study team decide continue exercise program participant 's best interest . This investigational study . Up 50 patient schedule pancreatic surgery take part pancreas study . The pancreas study one many small study , add together , enroll 290 participant MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
