	<brief_summary>Appropriate delivery adequate nutrition medication premature infant often require central venous access form special IV call PICC ( peripherally insert central catheter ) . While necessary feature neonatal intensive care , PICCs pose significant risk : among serious infection . One common , successful infection control practice use old child adult involve use lock , fluid-filled syringe attach end IV use order prevent and/or treat clot infection . The solution leave period time either withdrawn line flush patient . The solution could saline , antibiotic , antiseptic , combination . However premature infant , use antibiotic lock compound risk leave behind organisms resistant treatment ; antiseptic irritate vessel cause breakage sensitive premature skin ; saline neither sterilization anti-infective property . By contrast , ethanol neutralizes kill bacteria , virus , fungi without risk resistance , externally apply risk baby skin . Ethanol-based lock protocol use safely effectively adult pediatric population without adverse effect , test premature baby fluids medication deliver continuously : placement lock traditionally require extend pause ( hour day ) fluid medication administration . To overcome key limitation , periodic , brief ethanol lock protocol design infant exposure interruption fluid medication delivery would minimize . The lock practical , cheap , easy place , take advantage exist daily pause IV tube fluid hook PICC change . The objective study test hypothesis use 70 % ethanol lock , every 3rd day , 15 minute , safely effectively reduce PICC infection unit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PICC infection particular concern NICU need long term intravenous access many very-low majority extremely-low birthweight infant , population high risk infection first place . Central line mainstay treatment baby need extend parenteral nutrition , associate blood stream infection , mention increase use anti-infectives , add hospitalization cost , long length stay , negative impact upon nutrition delivery infectious complication occur . Existing infection control practice differ unit region , include hand washing , sterile precaution insertion dressing change , elimination mandatory schedule dressing change , minimize port access extent permit clinical care , prophylactic antibiotic , close medication system . Success variable : standard highly effective , safe approach infection control , central line infection remain leading cause morbidity mortality NICU . A standard practice maintain central line patency use lock syringe contain heparinized solution . Locks contain antibiotic use prevent infection central line treat already-infected line , approach confers risk development organism resistant treatment . External chlorhexidine-impregnated dressing use harm premature skin achieve sterilization lumen hub , infection originate . Medical grade ethyl alcohol ( ethanol ) widely use compound use disinfectant , preservative , antidote ingest ethylene glycol ( anti-freeze ) , anti-microbial . The FDA list specific approval indication though 's use widely recognize . Multiple study conduct sheep , child adult , use 0.5-2 mL 70 % ethanol lock successfully prevent and/or treat catheter relate infection without development resistant organism , adverse side effect patient , disruption catheter integrity . Though ethanol lock approach yet apply premature neonate , safe successful precedent human young 3 month establish ; first trial ethanol lock NICU setting .</detailed_description>
