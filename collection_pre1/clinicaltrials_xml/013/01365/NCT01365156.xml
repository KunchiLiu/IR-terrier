	<brief_title>Extraperitoneal Para-aortic Lymph Node Dissection ( EPLND ) Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) scan check status disease . For 6 hour PET/CT scan , must eat drink anything except water . A small tube place arm , receive injection small amount mildly radioactive sugar material bloodstream . The radioactive nature inject material allow scanner `` see '' certain place body . After injection , need rest quietly time scan . The amount rest time may vary , prepared wait 45 90 minute . During scan , lie flat back table . The scan may last 1 hour . The study doctor discuss test result . If test show eligible take part study , enrol . Other treatment option discuss . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group . You equal chance assign either group . If Group 1 , extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy follow chemoradiation therapy . If Group 2 , receive standard-of-care chemoradiation therapy . Study Procedure Visits : If Group 1 , extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy , procedure surgeon remove examine lymph node abdomen . The study doctor explain risk procedure sign separate surgical consent form . This procedure perform 7-10 day chemoradiation treatment begin . During laparoscopy procedure , telescope-like instrument small camera end ( laparoscope ) place small cut abdomen . Three ( 3 ) small cut make place instrument may need complete surgery . Before laparoscope insert , carbon dioxide gas pump abdomen make easy surgeon see . The laparoscope place small cut . Using TV monitor , surgeon use camera find lymph node abdomen remove . After procedure finish , carbon dioxide gas remove take recovery room . If lymph node contain cancer , area body treat radiation `` extend '' treat new area . Future treatment option base found . This mean radiation use treat lymph node abdomen standard area radiation pelvis . Participants group radiation 5 day row 5 5½ week . If study doctor think need agree , extra radiation treatment . Participants group receive cisplatin chemotherapy vein 2 hour , 1 time every week 6 week . In case , treatment give Mondays ( Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 ) . After 5 5½ week chemotherapy radiation treatment , participant group receive implant pelvis 48 hour . You remain hospital time . The study doctor explain risk procedure sign separate surgical consent form . Length Study : You may study 5 year . Your participation study complete radiation treatment follow-up visit describe . You may take study intolerable side effect occur unable follow study direction . Long-Term Follow-Up : The following test procedure perform : - You PET scan check status disease 3 month complete radiation treatment . - You CT scan check status disease every 6 month next 3 year . You visit clinic physical exam : - Every 3 month first 2 year - Every 6 month next 3 year , - One ( 1 ) time year , 5 year This investigational study . The extraperitoneal laparoscopic lymphadenectomy consider investigational . Chemoradiation treatment FDA approve treatment cervical cancer . Up 600 patient take part multicenter study . Up 40 enrol MD Anderson . Up 15 enrolled Harris Health System .</detailed_description>
