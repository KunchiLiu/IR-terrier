	<brief_title>Linifanib Treating Patients With Advanced , Refractory Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To achieve overall response rate 15 % . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression free survival . II . Determine overall survival . III . Evaluate toxicity profile ABT 869 ( linifanib ) patient population . OUTLINE : Patients receive Linifanib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
