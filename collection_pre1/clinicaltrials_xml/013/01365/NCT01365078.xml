	<brief_summary>Evidence exists EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid C20:5n-3 ) supplementation reduce risk coronary heart disease . EPA synthesize α-linolenic acid ( ALA C18:3n-3 ) , conversion low . It suggest rate-limiting step conversion Δ6-desaturation ALA stearidonic acid ( SDA C18:4n-3 ) . Thus , provide oil rich SDA may increase endogenous synthesis EPA . This may subsequently low serum triacylglycerol concentration , effect frequently observe EPA supplementation , especially people increase triacylglycerol level . The objective study effect echium oil , rich SDA serum triacylglycerol concentration healthy overweight slightly obese men woman . The minor objective study effect echium oil omega-3 index , negatively related cardiovascular risk define proportion EPA DHA red blood cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Using randomize , double-blind , placebo control crossover design , subject receive random order six week washout period least 14 day , daily 10 g echium oil high-oleic acid sunflower oil ( HOSO ) control . Thirty-six healthy men woman , age 18-70 yr , body mass index 25 35 kg/m2 participate . Subjects increase BMI increase risk develop hypertriglyceridemia . During experimental period , subject receive daily one sachet lunch one sachet dinner provide 5 g echium oil . During control period , subject receive daily time point sachet amount HOSO . The main study parameter change fast serum triacylglycerol concentration . The secondary endpoint change omega-3 index .</detailed_description>
