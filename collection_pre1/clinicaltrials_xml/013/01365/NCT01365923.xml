	<brief_summary>During recovery general anesthesia stimulus endotracheal tube lead coughing , hypertension , tachycardia , cause serious complication . Especially postoperative course patient emerge general anesthesia intracranial surgery frequently complicate occurrence hypertension cough event . It demonstrate opioid , intravenous topical lidocaine administration attenuate cough reflex . Administered opioid emergence , effective prevent cough reflex recovery delay , difficult predict emergence . However , remifentanil opioid widely use rapid context-sensitive half-life , target-controled infusion method adequately maintain effect site concentration could help predict recovery time alert state general anesthesia . It consider proper method continuous infusion remifentanil reduce emergence cough . Dexmedetomidine , potent alpha adrenoceptor agonist dose-dependently reduces arterial blood pressure heart rate , decrease hemodynamic catecholamine response intubation extubation . It thus theologically appropriate reduce airway circulatory reflex emergence anesthesia . In study , investigator use bolus dexmedetomidine immediately extubation , compare effect cough , hemodynamic response recovery profile continuous infusion remifentanil .</brief_summary>
