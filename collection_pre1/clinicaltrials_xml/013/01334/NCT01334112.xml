	<brief_title>Study Axitinib Patients With Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II study investigational drug , Axitinib follow prior antiangiogenic therapy patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma . Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) primary cancer liver . Angiogenesis physiological process involve growth new blood vessel pre-existing vessel . A tyrosine kinase enzyme inhibit angiogenesis . In study , patient advance HCC fail prior antiangiogenic therapy , receive Axitinib cycle 4 week . Axitinib oral , potent selective inhibitor angiogenesis . This study evaluate response rate HCC follow treatment Axitinib well safety , feasibility , overall survival patient , progression-free survival , quality life person unresectable HCC . The study also compare response determine RECIST response determine Choi Criteria .</detailed_description>
