	<brief_summary>This study do study doctor try develop new test help transplant doctor monitor patient high panel reactive antibody ( PRA ) . The test would use monitor patient ' PRA doctor try low process know desensitization . Desensitization lower high PRA level allow patient receive transplant . This single center study evaluate optimize use new laboratory test detect measure immune system 's functioning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sensitization HLA antigens main barrier solid organ transplantation . Currently , HLA sensitization monitor test patient ' serum panel HLA antigens ( whether present cell surface solid phase matrix ) calculate % positive response . Such result give indication relative breadth sensitization `` depth '' - relative strength specific antibody , provide information regard memory B cell / plasma cell manufacture specific HLA direct antibody . This single center study evaluate optimize use in-vitro assay enumerate B cell produce human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -specific antibody . The propose assay base principle use enumeration specific cytokine produce memory T cell - ELISPOT assay . The investigator currently use T cell ELISPOT assay laboratory . The investigator believe propose assay provide biologically relevant immune measure crucial long term outcome transplantation highly sensitized patient . Highly sensitize patient encompass high risk patient group among transplant recipient . The propose assay design predict fate DSA produce ( capable produce ) memory plasma cell . Thus , allow prediction early detection activation humoral arm immune system , specifically donor . This , turn , may prompt early intervention preservation allograft . Three tube blood drawn twice , 8-12 week apart , clinic standard care dialysis visit follow optimization . Subjects undergo desensitization three tube blood draw seven time course two year analysis .</detailed_description>
