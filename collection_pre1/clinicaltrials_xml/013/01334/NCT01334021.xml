	<brief_summary>The goal research study find researcher use genetic test tumor sample predict tumor respond breast cancer treatment . The tumor sample test learn certain gene activate ( turn ) tumor . Researchers hope activation gene may predict tumor sensitive resistant routine breast cancer treatment , chemotherapy hormonal therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involve perform test sample tumor . If agree take part study , tumor biopsy receive drug treat breast cancer . The sample tumor take one follow time : - At time plan biopsy learn breast cancer . - At time plan surgery remove know breast cancer . - If breast cancer previously biopsied doctor plan give breast cancer treatment surgery , biopsy start drug . The amount tumor collect study size tip pencil . If go surgery remove breast cancer receive breast cancer treatment , small piece tumor remove sent testing . If go plan needle biopsy , extra core sample and/or fine needle sample take . If go research biopsy , ultrasound mammogram use find tumor needle inserted tumor collect piece tissue . After genetic test complete , researcher use result learn well test able give result use predict response breast cancer drug therapy . Test Results : Because investigational test , neither doctor tell result test . This test also use guide doctor 's choice therapy . This study look well test able predict response tumor breast cancer treatment . For 5 year , study staff review medical record see respond breast cancer therapy receive . If treat outside MD Anderson , call ask . This phone call take 5 minute . To protect privacy , information store part study keep secure confidential . Length Study : You study 5 year follow-up . This investigational study . The test perform breast cancer tumor sample investigational test . Up 1100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient undergo biopsy surgery primary tumor site suspect proven invasive breast cancer clinical Stage I III ; stage IV patient allow included feasibility assessment , include outcomes analysis secondary objective 1.2.4 , 1.2.5 1.2.6 . 2 . The clinical radiologic primary tumor size least 1 cm diameter 1 . The patient proven HER2positive breast cancer , define pathology report amplification gene 3+ score immunohistochemical staining . 2 . The patient receive prior systemic therapy radiation therapy breast cancer . 3 . The patient prior history invasive metastatic cancer within 5 year diagnosis breast cancer , exclude squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin . 4 . The patient prior excisional biopsy primary invasive breast cancer . 5 . There hematoma biopsy site change obscure primary tumor . 6 . Patients deem medically ineligible adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy . Patients ER+ tumor deem medically eligible hormonal therapy , chemotherapy consider eligible protocol . Patients ER tumor candidate adjuvant anthracycline base chemotherapy consider ineligible protocol . Patients undergo biopsy later find ineligible adjuvant therapy assess primary objective , exclude secondary objective .</criteria>
