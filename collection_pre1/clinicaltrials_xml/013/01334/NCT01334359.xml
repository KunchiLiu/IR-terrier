	<brief_summary>Recent trend identify decreasing level physical activity , fitness , health preadolescent child . Examining factor , physical activity behavior aerobic fitness positively influence cognitive health school-age child important improve school performance , maximize health , improve overall functioning individual progress human lifespan . A sample preadolescent child Urbana , Illinois elementary school system randomly assign 9- month afterschool program focus either aerobic exercise wait-list control group determine effect physical activity basic apply aspect cognition . Changes neuroimaging behavioral index cognitive function performance standardize academic achievement test mathematics read examine function participation intervention . Preliminary research support physical activity positively associate basic applied aspect cognition , strong relationship task require extensive amount executive control . However , previous research mainly focus old adult , little research examine relationship physical activity executive control child . These finding provide lifestyle consideration child improve cognitive health across lifespan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim proposal improve understanding factor related brain health cognition school-aged child examine effect 9-month exercise intervention basic applied aspect cognition preadolescent child . From basic measurement perspective , event-related brain potential , MRI , fMRI , behavioral index cognition study several task aim assess various aspect executive control . Preliminary research observe faster efficient performance high-fit , relative low-fit , child adult use neuroelectric measure reflect attentional allocation environmental stimuli response monitoring process , along behavioral measure reflect response speed accuracy . These preliminary finding indicate great top-down attentional control may associate increase physical activity . From applied measurement perspective , preliminary research find child great aerobic fitness perform well standardized achievement test read mathematics , compare child low aerobic fitness , suggest exercise may relate academic performance apply school setting . To date , causal evidence exists regard effect physical activity neuroelectric , behavioral , applied school performance index cognition child . Accordingly , proposal investigate aerobic activity training intervention measure cognition use three task require variable amount executive control , Illinois Standardized Achievement Test use randomize control design participant assign afterschool physical activity program wait-list control group . Given recent trend identify decreased level physical activity health status preadolescents , understand potential benefit physical activity cognition great interest . It imperative factor positively influence cognitive function child examine maximize health effective functioning individual progress lifespan .</detailed_description>
