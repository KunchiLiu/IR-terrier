	<brief_title>Assessment Fitness After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy Rectal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To evaluate effect chemoradiotherapy pre−operative fitness patient prior major colorectal cancer surgery . Design : Patients act case−control . Patients consent early available opportunity follow decision surgically treatable disease consent pre−operative NACRT . Consent study gain outpatient . At `` visit 1 '' patient undergo CPET , current standard practice , prior commence neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . As part assessment , pulmonary function test ( static lung volume , lung diffuse capacity ) . They undergo 6 week long course NACRT , standard current practice institution . At `` visit 2 '' , approximately four six week follow chemoradiotherapy another CPET test repeat . This also current standard practice institution . Data visit 1 visit 2 compare paired manner . A statistician consult assess degree normality data , statistical test use , power calculation . At point treatment postpone change solely purpose collect data research .</detailed_description>
