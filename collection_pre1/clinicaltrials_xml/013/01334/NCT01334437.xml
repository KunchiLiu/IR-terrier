	<brief_summary>Intend use : A blood test Cancer Associated Antibodies ( CAAA ) aid initial diagnosis ovarian cancer woman suspect ovarian pathology detect primary diagnostic technique . Test Description : Blood collect patient serum/plasma test presence CAAA experimental test kit . Objectives : To assess effectiveness CAAA test . Target Population : The study population include woman diagnose suspected ovarian cancer ( OC ) , verified pathology/cytology patient , woman suspect ovarian cancer verify pathology/cytology non-cancers control set blood sample collect age match woman history cancer . Structure : Women enrol study check presence CAAAb , result CAAAb test compare pathology submit physician participate center patient population clinical history control population . Sample Size : The investigator collect least 50 patient verified pathology/cytology patient least two age match healthy control two age match suspect verified non-cancers . Total amount least 250 sample . ( Multi center study , statistical rationale provide ) . Primary Effectiveness Variables : The effectiveness test define specificity test conditionally sensitivity low pre-defined level 95 % . Endpoint : The endpoint study show effectiveness high 50 % . Clinical Monitor : For site dedicate CRO appoint monitor clinical trial . All data store protected internet-based database , change data traced record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since mutation normal cell lead malignancy , involve change structure function cell , could assume immune system recognize change antigenic determinates respond . For many year , investigator try distinguish cancer patient healthy population difference specific autoantibody level . In healthy population , baseline amount autoantibody determine , patient population statistically significant high level autoantibody . The presence autoantibodies population different level make difficult find specifically discriminate antibody . To date , specific autoantibody distinguish solely healthy cancer patient ( oppose autoimmune disease , specific autoantibody find high level patient ) . Our work assumes specific Autoantibodies expression level alter cancer , thus change indicate presence / absence cancer . In experiment protocol , check change expression level specific autoantibody woman ovarian pathology compare woman without cancer . The CAAA test comprise blood collection process step follow detection specific auto antibody ELISA base assay mathematical processing , subsequent classification result `` positive '' `` negative '' ovarian cancer . The study population include woman schedule pathological cytological confirmation either surgical procedure ( laparoscopy/laparotomy ) kind biopsy cytology , prior anti-cancer treatment age match control . The clinical suspicion include one following : Pelvic mass/cyst ( pelvic examination and/or image technique ) , and/or high CA-125 level , and/or ascites , and/or due incidental finding distant metastasis . Final verification ( `` true positive '' `` true negative '' ) do relation pathology/cytology result healthy woman relation clinical history . Subject Selection Suspected ovarian cancer woman ( patient non-cancers woman ) - Inclusion criterion - follow - 18 year . - Patients suspected ovarian pathology . The clinical suspicion include one following : Pelvic mass/cyst ( pelvic examination and/or image technique ) , and/or high CA-125 level , and/or ascites , and/or due incidental finding distant metastasis . Final analysis do relation pathology/cytology result . - Patients schedule laparotomy/laparoscopy/surgery , ideally . Suspected ovarian cancer woman ( patient non-cancers woman ) - Exclusion criterion : follow - Less 18 year age - Hematological malignancy - Autoimmune disorder diagnose patient . - Previous current tumor - Patients active chemotherapy treatment Suspected ovarian cancer patient - final classification â€¢ The `` true positive '' group consist sequential patient satisfy inclusion criterion positive ovarian cancer pathology result . The `` true negative '' group consist sequential patient satisfy inclusion criterion negative ovarian cancer pathology result . This study base multi-centers participation . The minimum number site study 2 . The current study single blind prospective validation study , involve consecutive suspect ovarian pathology woman schedule biopsy/surgery study duration , pathology/cytology ovarian cancer ( true positive ) XXX number woman negative ovarian pathology/cytology result ( true negative ) healthy woman . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness CAAA test . The effectiveness study define specificity CAAA test pre define sensitivity 95 % . The study evaluate sensitivity CAAA test show declare level 95 % . According current medical publication , assume study population include 10-20 % true positive cancer case . As today , large proportion suspect patient diagnosed final pathology laparoscopy/surgery . In study , true positive true negative case ( verified pathology ) compare CAAA test result . Study Procedure Subjects clinical information acquire patient 's medical file , include age , medical history result test do lead diagnostic evaluation ovarian cancer record appropriate , bar-coded , pre-study case report form .The report electronic via dedicate secured internet site , change database record traceable . The study anonymous Department keep name patient without revel investigator study sponsor . The doctor/ nurse/ phlebotomist collect heparin vacuum/serological tube ( 8ml ) , label ( bar-code ) . The blood handle laboratory collect serum/plasma serum keep frozen -80C . ELISA base test detection Auto Antibodies relative expression ratio , conduct sample accord lab protocol . The sample test response antigen identify previous training set . All data permanently record directly dedicate computer . For sample antibody result put coded patient file . A mathematical algorithm determine sample positive negative . The final pathology compare CAAA test result . The result analyze statistician expertise cancer population study . The current study blind prospective validation study , involve consecutive suspect ovarian pathology subject schedule biopsy/surgery/cytology study duration . The purpose study assess sensitivity specificity CAAA test detection ovarian cancer woman schedule biopsy/surgery/cytology . Subjects screen potential participation study , accord inclusion exclusion criterion . The data include parameter clinical pathological/cytological state subject result CAAA ELISA . There two goal study . To test sensitivity CAAA pre-defined level . To evaluate specificity CAAA test . Statistical Hypothesis The main condition determine sample size validate sensitivity test lower predefined level . The classification rule establish way sensitivity teach sample 100 % . We assume real sensitivity lower 99 % . Null Hypothesis : The sensitivity test high 95 % . A database management system shall design maintain , include screen preparation , edit check program . Pre-entry post-entry quality control clinical data shall perform data entry center . All ELISA test result uploaded database via internet base interface , lock change . In order change ELISA test result , unlocking database require consent local CRO , sponsor site physician . Unlocking do webmaster , recorder trace system component , hard copy hold sponsor CRO site .</detailed_description>
