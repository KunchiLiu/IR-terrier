	<brief_title>The Trial Pessary After Laser TTTS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monochorionic ( MC ) twin pregnancy present high rate fetal complication , associate placental vascular anastomosis . Fetoscopic laser coagulation ( FLC ) surgical technique allow minimally invasive access uterus emerge useful tool management common severe complication , twin twin transfusion syndrome ( TTTS ) . Even though , preterm birth remain common cause adverse outcome TTTS associate 29 % risk deliver 28 week . A short cervical length ( CL ) , define CL â‰¤ 25 mm , detect transvaginal ultrasound independent risk factor preterm birth twin pregnancy effective treatment describe prevent . Although usually accept twin pregnancy cerclage may increase risk preterm birth , Salomon co-worker , find case TTTS CL 5th percentile ( 15 mm ) time surgery , perform emergency cerclage prolong pregnancy allow good outcome , But still preterm birth FLC remain big challenge , new method prevent must investigate . Previous study singleton twin show use cervical pessary significantly reduce frequency birth 32 week prolongs pregnancy . The advantage use cervical pessary less invasive cerclage remove easily . That 's reason pessary could consider alternative , non invasive option prevent preterm birth case twin twin transfusion syndrome ( TTTS ) treat laser surgery .</detailed_description>
