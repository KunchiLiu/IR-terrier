	<detailed_description>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) treatment Alzheimer disease . Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) lead cause dementia cognitive deteriorating advanced age . The current medical treatment AD mainly symptomatic many limitation . This main target study determine safety efficacy transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) use novel coil design ( H2 ) stimulation deep brain structure concomitantly regular treatment Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) patient . TMS act generate magnetic field brain simulate neuro-chemical change stimulate neuronal activity translate increase secretion growth factor brain derive neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) . Hence postulate TMS positive effect cognitive behavioral symptom patient AD may ameliorate progression disease . The treatment non-invasive , significant side effect , need hospitalization anesthesia . The trial phase IIb double blind study include 45 AD patient age 50 80 mild moderate AD ( Mini Mental State Examination [ MMSE ] 16 26 ) divide 3 group . All participant receive standard medical therapy AD . In addition , patient recruit study receive 16 session TMS H2 coil 8 week . The first group receive excitatory stimulation 10 Hz prefrontal parietal cortex , second group receive inhibitory stimulation 1 Hz similar brain area control patient receive amount Sham session . Patient receive 3 treatment per week first 3 week 1 treatment per week additional 4 week . Patients evaluate treatment , 8 week treatment another 8 week without treatment . The evaluation include cognitive function accord ADAS-COG MMSE , Activity daily live ( ADL ) function accord ADSC-ADL , behavioral function accord Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) , depression accord Cornell Scale Depression Dementia ( CSDD ) , care giver satisfaction accord RUD LITE scale computerize cognitive evaluation accord NEXING battery . We expect cognitive , behavioral ADL function improve well study group compare Sham treat group . From previous trial TMS neurological patient , although AD , anticipate adverse event rate similar group prove safety deep TMS treatment patient AD . In case hypothesis proven , deep TMS treatment add important modality conventional therapy AD patient .</detailed_description>
