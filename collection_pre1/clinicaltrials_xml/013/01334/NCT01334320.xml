	<brief_summary>Controversy surgical treatment clinically negative neck early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma revolve around uncertainty impact patient prognosis . The efficacy elective neck dissection prognosis T1 , 2 N0M0 patient continue subject clinical debate . Currently clinically negative patient treat one two main policy : one elective neck dissection ; `` watchful waiting '' . The objective multi-institutional prospective randomize control study evaluate survival benefit elective neck dissection prognosis T1 , 2 N0M0 patient carcinoma oral cavity . The enrolled patient T1 , 2 N0M0 oral cancer randomize two group : elective neck dissection versus watch wait . The survival rate recurrence rate two group compare . The result study give surgeon evidence-based instruction management clinically negative neck patient cancer oral cavity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There controversy benefit elective neck dissection ( END ) clinically negative neck early stage oral squamous cell carcinoma . The aim study determine need randomize control trial order evaluate survival benefit elective neck dissection prognosis T1 , 2 N0M0 patient carcinoma oral cavity . We initiate multi-institutional study , expect 448 primary oral cancer patient enrol . And go randomly divide patient two group : END `` watch wait '' . The END group undergo one stage surgery END primary tumor excision , `` watch wait '' group treat primary tumor excision transorally initial treatment , rigorous postoperation consultation . All patient follow least 5 year initial treatment , survival rate recurrence rate group compare .</detailed_description>
