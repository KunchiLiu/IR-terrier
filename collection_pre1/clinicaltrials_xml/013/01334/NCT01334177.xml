	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 give together cetuximab treat patient locally advance , recurrent , metastatic squamous cell cancer head neck ( SCCHN ) . Biological therapy , TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 together cetuximab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , tolerability assess dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) VTX-2337 ( TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 ) give conjunction cetuximab order define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacodynamic immune response VTX-2337 combination cetuximab . II . Correlative assessment immunologic response activity perform , include : Quantitative evaluation baseline immune status via in-vitro assessment cytokine chemokine response immunostimulatory agent ; quantitative assessment plasma cytokine , chemokines , inflammatory marker via protein array ; quantitative assessment natural killer ( NK ) cell via flow cytometry ; quantitative assessment antigen-specific response cytokine-producing cell common prognostic SCCHN antigens via interferon ( INF ) gamma-enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ( ELISpot ) . III . To assess whether subject functional genetic variation TLR8 FC-gamma-R IIIA gene alter biological and/or clinical response VTX-2337 , genetic characterization subject perform via standard genotyping assay . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity combination VTX-2337 cetuximab , measure Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) v1.1 criterion . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study TLR8 Agonist VTX-2337 . Patients receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 60-120 minute day -28 , -21 , -14 , -7 week -4 -1 . Patients receive cetuximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 TLR8 agonist VTX-2337 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
