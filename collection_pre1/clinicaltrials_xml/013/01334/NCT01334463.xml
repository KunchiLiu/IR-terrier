	<detailed_description>Individuals serve Operation Enduring Freedom ( OEF ) Operation Iraqi Freedom ( OIF ) report history traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) symptom associate post traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Standard neuropsychological measure ineffective distinguish TBI PTSD . This pilot project examine whether method cognitive neuroscience determine effect TBI and/or PTSD executive function . Executive function include many aspect goal-oriented behavior , include ability inhibit inappropriate behavior thought . In proposed study , investigator focus inhibitory processing , core component executive function . Although TBI PTSD compromise executive function TBI often occur context traumatic event , little research attempt disentangle effect condition inhibitory control . In addition , investigator interested disinhibition may link impulsive real-world behavior , suicidal tendency , observe elevate rate individual TBI well PTSD . Knowing way inhibitory function compromise individual aid development appropriate treatment aim functional improvement mild TBI , PTSD , mild TBI+PTSD .</detailed_description>
