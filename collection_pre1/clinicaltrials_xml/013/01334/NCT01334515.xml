	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well hu14.18-interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) fusion protein work give together sargramostim isotretinoin treat patient relapsed refractory neuroblastoma . Biological therapy , hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein , sargramostim work different way stimulate immune system stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , isotretinoin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein together sargramostim isotretinoin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) isotretinoin give combination hu14.18-IL-2 ( hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein ) , test feasibility future Phase III study . II . To evaluate anti-tumor activity hu14.18-IL2 give combination GM-CSF isotretinoin patient recurrent refractory neuroblastoma disease measurable standard radiographic criterion ( stratum-1 ) . III . To evaluate anti-tumor activity hu14.18-IL2 give combination GM-CSF isotretinoin patient recurrent refractory neuroblastoma evaluable meta iodo benzyl guanidine I 123 ( MIBG ) scintigraphy and/or bone marrow histology ( stratum-2 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe disease burden stratum-2 patient semi-quantitative assessment bone marrow MIBG scintigraphy determine whether association lower disease burden response hu14.18-IL2 . II . To assess molecular parameter response ( reverse-transcriptase ( RT ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ) patient meet complete response ( CR ) criterion . III . To evaluate immunologic activation induce vivo hu14.18-IL2 . IV . To determine induction anti-hu14.18-IL2 antibody treatment hu14.18-IL2 . V. To test association tumor response versus immune activation anti-hu14.18-IL2 activity , measurement toxicity versus immune activation anti-hu14.18-IL2 activity . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord measurable disease ( disease measurable standard radiographic criterion [ stratum-1 ] v disease evaluable meta iodo benzyl guanidine I 123 ( MIBG ) and/or bone marrow histology [ stratum-2 ] ) . Patients receive sargramostim subcutaneously ( SC [ prefer ] ) IV 2 hour day 1-2 8-14 , hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein IV 4 hour day 4-6 , isotretinoin orally ( PO ) twice daily day 11-24 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4-10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stratum-1 achieve stable disease ( SD ) course 4 remove protocol therapy . Patients stratum-2 achieve SD course 4 receive 2 additional course study treatment . Patients may undergo blood bone marrow sample collection periodically correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , yearly 2 year .</detailed_description>
