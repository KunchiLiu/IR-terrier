	<brief_title>Safety Study Radiation CP-675,206 Infusion Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common cancer Canadian woman . In 2007 estimate 22,300 woman diagnose 5300 die disease . Despite advance therapy , metastatic disease remain incurable illness , median survival 2 year . Standard systemic treatment option metastatic disease include chemotherapy hormonal therapy . Radiation frequently use metastatic set palliation symptom , frequent site radiation bone . Response rate first line chemotherapy range 30 % , however responses durable . Currently curative option metastatic disease , underscore need novel therapeutic approach . CTLA4 receptor express surface activate T cell regulatory T cell . CTLA-blockade test clinical trial use humanized monoclonal antibody , biological response report . The anti-tumor immune response may augment combination CTLA4-blockade radiation , potential mediate regression metastasis outside field radiation . The primary goal study therefore establish safety CTLA4-blockade use antibody CP-675 , 206 combination radiation . This trial conduct prelude plan phase II trial CP-675,206 combination radiation metastatic breast cancer .</detailed_description>
