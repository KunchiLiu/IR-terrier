	<detailed_description>A . SPECIFIC AIMS The result prospective pilot cohort study use power inform design randomize controlled trial . Its specific aim : 1 . To characterize receptivity patient late stage lung colon cancer perform individualized fitness program prevent deconditioning functional decline . 2 . To estimate adherence patient LSC ( LSC ) individualize fitness program . 4 . To estimate degree symptom , e.g . fatigue pain , associate adherence individualized fitness program . 5 . To estimate improvement functional status associate performance individualized fitness program among patient LSC . B . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Most people LSC function poorly diagnosis , deteriorate steadily period month year , become dependent prior death . Their disablement exacts stagger cost quality life ( QoL ) , caregiver burden , health care expense . Oncologic clinician , result train focus treatment cancer , often neither systematically detect treat function symptom problem cause disablement . As consequence rehabilitation therapy , even well documented evidence benefit , tend under-utilized provide late maximally effective . The public health burden issue likely worsen give improve survival patient LSC increase age medical complexity treat . C. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Design A randomize control trial . Duration Following enrollment , study participant remain study 2.5 month instruction individualize REST program . REST titration tailor participant specific barrier occur telephone 2 week `` initiation phase '' initial REST instruction . Thereafter , patient perform REST independently home 8 week `` training phase '' `` need '' telephone-based guidance PT . We therefore anticipate study continue total 6 month ; 3 month recruit 68 patient additional 2.5 month participant complete initiation training phase protocol . Subject Enrollment Identification participant . A sample 68 patient Stage III IV NSCLC Extensive stage SCLC , Stage IV colon cancer identify . Dr. Cheville contact eligible patient telephone receive mail describe study permit opt return postage-paid postcard . A 'fold ' postcard send maintain patient 's privacy regard lung colon cancer diagnosis . Dr. Cheville 's effort contact eligible patient continue 5 attempt make different week day times day . Eligibility inclusion exclusion criterion assess . If patient eligible , study describe detail verbal consent obtain desire participate . An informed consent form mail patient willing participate study ensure adequate opportunity review document . Informed consent obtain Dr. Cheville patient come Mayo Clinic study enrollment . All question answer prior obtain informed consent . Eligibility . Eligible subject must diagnosis Stage III IV NSCLC extensive stage SCLC , Stage IV colon cancer receive chemotherapeutic regimen require visit Mayo Clinic Department Medical Oncology &lt; every 4 week first 6 week follow enrollment undergo monitor visit comparable interval . Pathological confirmation require oncology provider specialize lung cancer high level certainty regard diagnosis . Entry criterion consider number location metastases prior treatment . The participant require fluent English language intact cognitive status ( Folstein mini-mental score &gt; 25 ) . Recruitment . Approximately 50 new lung cancer case diagnose month Mayo Clinic . Of , 70 % initially diagnosed Stage III Stage IV NSCLC Extensive Stage SCLC 60 % elect receive cancer-related care Mayo . Recruitment rate previous work population high . The propose intervention entail great patient commitment anticipate recruitment rate 50 % . We target patient meet study criterion undergo ongoing treatment MCCC well newly diagnose . We anticipate recruitment rate 10 patient per month recruitment continue 3 month . We previously recruit patient colon cancer , anticipate recruitment 10 patient per month base experience researcher . Randomization . Patients block randomize REST intervention wait-list control . Stratified randomization use . Intervention Overview . The intervention provision individualize , 2-part , 3-tiered REST program include exercise list Table 1 participant randomly assign intervention arm . In addition , participant receive step pedometer encourage remain active possible study period base objective feedback pedometer reading . A PT specialized cancer rehabilitation instruct participant REST adapt program accommodate symptom , co-morbidities , issue may impede participant 's ability perform REST program . The PT follow participant telephone 1- 2-weeks follow REST instruction encourage participant problem solve regard barrier may impede performance REST . After 2-week initiation phase , participant perform REST independently 8 week training phase encourage contact PT question difficulty . Patient report outcome ( PROs ) measure collect baseline prior REST instruction completion 2-month training phase , outline . Baseline assessment REST instruction . Patients examine instructed REST program day visit Mayo clinic either treatment evaluation . REST feasible add patient ' already significant travel demand . The PI obtain functional history perform routine physical examination patient ensure may safely participate identify impairment physical vulnerability require individualizing REST program . A tailored REST fitness program develop patient PT specialize cancer rehabilitation . Patients provide upper low extremity REST routine ( require 7 minute ) design maintain core appendicular strength minimal burden . The REST low extremity routine include 6 exercise target hip flexor , hip abductor , hip extensor , knee extensor , knee flexor , shoulder stabilizer , back extensor . The REST upper extremity routine include 5 exercise target elbow extensor , elbow flexor , shoulder stabilizer , shoulder flexor , abdominal muscle . Each routine perform 1 3 intensity level depend participant feel give day . Each routine perform twice per week maximum total 28 minute resistive strengthen per week . The standard REST low extremity program perform stand position ; however program adapt seated performance . Note REST program also individualized accommodate impairment degenerative arthritis , back pain osseous instability . Subjects also dispense pedometer encourage wear daily first 2 week study enrollment order establish average baseline number step per day . Thereafter instructed wear pedometer 3 time per week chart number step take wake retire bed encourage 'make ' days/weeks few step take due increase symptom burden , post-chemotherapy fatigue , contingency . Subjects provide laminated card illustrate REST program encourage adherence . They also receive ring bound monthly calendar REST program illustrate top calendar bottom designate box number pedometer record step per day indicate ( ) tier REST program complete give day . Calendars submit analysis end 2 month study period . Modified laminate card calendar page provide change health status require alteration REST program . Initiation phase . Participants encourage perform upper extremity lower extremity REST program twice per week . After first week , follow study PT telephone address question may address difficulty REST . The PT may adjust REST program prove uncomfortable overly fatigue . Participants continue perform REST program modification second week training . They follow study PT telephone end second week address issue . Dr. Cheville serve resource study PT initiation phase case he/she question regard symptom control safety REST . Training phase . Following initiation phase participant continue perform REST program 4 time per week ( 2 upper 2 low extremity ) 8 week . While follow telephone call schedule study PT , participant encourage contact PT question difficulty . The PT consult Dr. Cheville need basis . Data Collection Patient-Reported Outcome ( PRO ) Measures . Baseline PROs collect subject sign inform consent , follow randomization , intervention group member , PTs instruct REST exercise . Week 10 PROs mail patient postage pay return envelope . Participants respond first week send second mailing . Subjects receive $ 25.00 compensation complete set PROs , total $ 50.00 . Ambulatory Post Acute Care Basic Mobility Daily Activity Short Forms FACIT-F Outcome Expectations Exercise Self Efficacy Exercise North Central Cancer Trials Group Patient Quality Life-Linear Analogue Self Assessment ( LASA ) Scale . The LASA Scale single item measurement global quality life rating numerical rating scale 0 10 well establish validity data cancer populations.38 Other Treatments . Oncological care affect study : subject continue make routine clinic visit receive oncological care usual . Analgesic medication permit ( assess ) , adjust co-intervention difference group analysis . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive statistic calculate participant ' demographic lung cancer-related characteristic , well function- symptom-related PROs . Descriptive statistic also calculate data collect study PT regard frequency specific problem ( e.g . shoulder pain REST ) encounter initiation phase , well number call per participant training phase , time per call , reason call . Data collect patient ' calendar record REST adherence step per day describe term proportion mean , respectively . An arbitrary threshold 75 % use distinguish participant adhere recommend 4 session per week . Participants perform REST program 4 time per week least 6 8 week train phase consider non-adherent . Exploratory analysis significant difference participant adhere perform nonparametric testing . The normality PROs assess test skew kurtosis . Nonparametric statistical test use evaluate PROs normally distribute . Student 's paired T-test use estimate effect intervention primary secondary outcome . Additionally , Wilcoxon rank sum test use compare degree change score patient randomize intervention group comply REST . The magnitude direction relationship change mean step per day training interval ( calculate mean week 10 minus mean baseline ) change PRO score assess Pearson correlation coefficient . Given pilot nature work , adjustment make multiple comparison .</detailed_description>
