	<detailed_description>The demand present day living place high premium time . Voluntary sleep curtailment endemic many adult typically sleep average six hour per night . Observational data suggest short sleep duration associate great likelihood obese . Low grade chronic sleep deprivation may constitute important potentially correctable behavioral factor alarm increase obesity . There definitive experimental study human show whether sleep deprivation indeed contributes increase energy intake and/or reduce energy expenditure . The investigator propose series novel study investigate abnormality energy homeostasis impart sleep deprivation . These study combine state-of-the-art technique monitor sleep , food intake , energy expenditure neuroendocrine energy regulation . The investigator measure food intake , energy expenditure ( basal metabolic rate , thermal effect food , non-exercise activity thermogenesis ) , neurohormone level 24 healthy subject normal BMI ( 20-25 kg/m2 ) . Twelve subject ( 6 men 6 woman ) randomize sleep deprivation . After 3 day baseline evaluation , subject undergo 8 day modest sleep deprivation follow 4 day recovery period . Measurements compare obtain 12 subject randomize control group , sleep deprive . Sleep deprive control subject comparable age gender undergo similar monitoring measurement Clinical Research Unit duration . The investigator test follow hypothesis : 1 . That sleep deprivation result positive energy balance ( increased caloric intake decrease energy expenditure , reflect decreased non-exercise activity thermogenesis ) . 2 . That dysregulation appetite energy expenditure associate change molecule control appetite metabolism . 3 . That change associate 8 day modest sleep deprivation resolve , least part , 4 day recovery period . This exploratory application build establish research program address first , neuroendocrine mechanism sleep obesity , second , regulation energy intake energy expenditure human . These study provide novel important insight whether sleep deprivation promotes increase food intake and/or reduce activity level , potential role molecule regulate appetite metabolism . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE : The investigator propose examine whether two week modest sleep restriction result increase food intake decrease energy expenditure , thus potentially predispose obesity . These finding help explain whether reduced sleep duration general population may contribute current epidemic obesity , suggest novel strategy weight control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subject sedentary . Sedentary define occupational calorie expenditure estimate great 50 % basal ( desk job light activity work : foot 3050 % work day ) whose exercise activity define sedentary accord selfreported activity questionnaire , confirm actigraphy measurement . Sedentary lifestyle define few four 20 min episode moderate vigorous intensity activity previous four week . We exclude subject medical psychiatric disorder , include history anxiety depression , take medication . Those found depression depression screen tool ( BDIII ) exclude . Current smoker exclude . All female subject undergo screen pregnancy test exclude positive . Subjects find significant sleep disorder exclude . Subjects find occult coronary artery disease exercise treadmill test exclude .</criteria>
