	<brief_summary>Immunosuppression key intervention patient solid organ transplant usually achieve combination therapy systemic CsA tacrolimus azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) , corticoid . However , outcome lung transplantation poor compare heart , kidney , liver transplantation , survival rate 55 % recipient lung transplant . Additional application aerosolise L-CsA suppress T-cell activation lung tissue subsequently BOS development . The overall purpose phase-II/III study obtain efficacy safety data L-CsA prevention BOS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preventive therapeutic intervention L-CsA primarily aim suppress T-lymphocyte suppression inflammatory response secondly prevent fibrotic effect make likely effective early stage BOS . Early development BOS , mostly diagnose , acute organ rejection strongly patho-physiological associate . Prevention early development chronic rejection L-CsA post LTX may ideal start point IMP application .</detailed_description>
