	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect combine new investigational drug ( OSI-906 ) standard drug ( sorafenib ) control liver cancer ( Hepatocellular cancer ) . Sorafenib ( brand name NexavarÂ® ) drug approve treatment advance liver cancer . It work stop growth new blood vessel around tumor . OSI-906 investigational agent work inhibit effect growth hormone cancer . The safety efficacy combine OSI-906 sorafenib treatment liver cancer risk know . The current study confirm safety combination first six patient evaluate activity combination patient advance liver cancer . In addition , study aim collect blood sample patient evaluate level OSI-906 patient receive combination two drug . The study also collect sample tumor evaluate marker predict patient combination effective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial OSI-906 Sorafenib Advanced Hepatocellular Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose trial first evaluate safety combination OSI-906 sorafenib patient HCC . Patients treat group three full dose sorafenib OSI-906 . If observe significant side effect , three additional patient treat dose level . After confirm safety combination ( possibly first six patietns ) study proceed regular accrual . The patient receive treatment orally evaluate physical exam , blood work imaging . If cancer well control therapy well tolerate patient continue trial . If side effect significant tumor start grow patient wish stop therapy patient time wil take trial . The trial willl collect blood sample evalute level investigaitonal agent blood . Also sample patient tumor analyze evalute marker may predict benefit treatment .</detailed_description>
