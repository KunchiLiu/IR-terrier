	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Cardiac troponins sensitive marker myocardial injury ACS even minor elevation cardiac troponins associate increase risk future adverse coronary event . However , detectable troponin release occur part patient admit ACS . The clinical outcome prognosis patient ACS absent TnT release vary widely , identification potential high-risk patient troponin negative ACS still remain major problem clinical routine . Therefore , aim study focus identify new biomarkers risk stratification . Omega- 3 Index : The value Omega-3 Index prognostic marker acute coronary syndrome still investigation . Vitamin D deficiency positively correlate cardiovascular risk N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA 's ) may reduce risk cardiovascular disease . Vitamin D either ingest , create skin exposure sun , whereas PUFA 's largely incorporated diet . Vitamin D deficiency human increase level influence color skin , geographical location , latitude , altitude , season daytime . In addition Vitamin D , several study show , N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA 's ) , also positive impact cardiovascular system . PUFA 's sufficiently synthesize body incorporate diet . These essential fatty acid find almost exclusively oily fish , show positive impact several cardiovascular risk factor . Fish , source Vitamin D omega-3 , frequently consume costal population Norway , less preferred inland beef-consuming population Northern Argentina . The subtropical location altitude Salta , Argentina , associate high exposure sun comparison temperate location Norway . The uptake Vitamin D costal population Norway may essentially diet , whereas sun exposure may essential source Vitamin D Northern Argentinean population . By investigate correlation omega-3 Vitamin D , may better understand nutritional impact Vitamin D correlation n-3 PUFA 's . B-type natriuretic peptide : B-type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) counter-regulatory peptide hormone predominantly synthesize ventricular myocardium . BNP release circulation response ventricular dilatation pressure overload , reflect ventricular wall stress tissue hypoxia rather cell injury per se . It well know marker leave ventricular dysfunction heart failure ( HF ) , provide prognostic information beyond leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . This marker neurohormonal activation inflammation play pivotal role across spectrum ACS , include patient ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( MI ) non ST-elevation ACS ( NSTE-ACS ) . Previous study demonstrate BNP measure first day onset symptom independently predict mortality , HF , new MI patient population . Elevated natriuretic peptide presentation show identify patient ACS high risk death HF , add information provide troponins . However , low-risk population association elevate BNP survival attenuate adjustment make echocardiographic variable ( addition clinical covariates ) , show Wang colleague . In addition , find association baseline BNP risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) . High-sensitive C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) : C-reactive protein ( CRP ) acute-phase reactant produce response acute injury , infection inflammation stimulus . It marker underlie systemic inflammation play important role initiation propagation atherosclerosis ultimately plaque rupture ensue thrombotic complication . Elevated level CRP first report patient hospitalize NSTE-ACS early 1990s . Through use appropriate high-sensitive assay , possible investigate relationship plasma CRP level previously consider normal cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Nevertheless , still debate marker prefer risk prediction . It suggest combined evaluation BNP CRP may yield incremental prognostic information risk stratification patient ACS , combine use show improve long-term risk prediction mortality patient stable CHD . To knowledge , limited data available directly compare two marker prospective manner unselected patient population present emergency department ( ED ) chest pain . In addition , role risk stratification patient ACS still evaluation , therefore additional investigation necessary . STUDY DESIGN This prospective regional multicenter observational non-invasive trial include 982 men woman admit chest pain potential ACS nine hopitals Salta , Argentina November 2005 November 2008 . Blood sample collect immediately follow admission . Patients stratify accord peak troponin T ( TnT ) release follow admission ; i.e . 1 ) patient admission TnT exceed 0.01 ng/mL , 2 ) patient TnT level 0.01 ng/mL . Assessment history previous MI , angina pectoris ( AP ) , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , diabetes mellitus arterial hypertension base hospital record personal interview . Electrocardiographic finding admission classify accord presence ST segment change . Written inform consent obtain patient . Survival status , date cause death clinical data obtain telephone interview hospital journal report 4 predefined time point ( 30 day , 6 , 12 24 month ) two year follow-up period . In case incapacity provide information , general practitioner nursery home contact relevant data . Hospital journal search confirmation report data . DATA OWNERSHIP AND PUBLICATION OF RESULTS . The ARRA-RACS Steering Committee ownership data register ARRA-RACS database , use data include preparation publication scientific report must approve Steering Committee . Scientific article publish ARRA-RACS investigator author mention name . The author sequence approve Steering Committee base upon contribution . Incentives involve article part doctoral thesis encourage . All collaborator study mention name Appendix section main article study . The result publish peer-reviewed scientific journal magazine general public .</detailed_description>
