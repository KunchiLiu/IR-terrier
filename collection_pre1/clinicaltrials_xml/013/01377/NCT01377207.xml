	<brief_summary>Recent study suggest important gender difference pathophysiology prognosis ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . This first prospective control study ass gender difference mechanism plaque rupture/erosion thrombus formation patient present STEMI treat primary angioplasty . Gender-related mechanism plaque rupture erosion investigate use combination Quantitative Coronary Angiography , high resolution Optical Coherence Tomography culprit vessel histopathologic analyse thrombus aspirate infarct related lesion , perform independent core laboratory , blind group ( male female ) clinical variable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Coherence Tomography Assessment Gender diVersity In Primary Angioplasty . The OCTAVIA Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In OCTAVIA ; enrollment 1:1 ratio accord gender group ensure computer-assisted matching algorithm gender age ( &lt; 50 , 51-70 , &gt; 70 year ) . Matching purpose enable enrollment even number male female patient balance age group . This type dynamic algorithm appropriate composition referral population know advance . OCTAVIA assess gender difference mechanism plaque rupture . The study also evaluate change vascular territory remote infarct relate lesion , local vascular response primary angioplasty intervention correlation clinical outcome one year follow-up . These data important support gender base differential strategy substantial impact improvement clinical practice treatment woman STEMI . The study sample 140 patient sized address hypothesis female population lower prevalence plaque rupture ( primary endpoint ) baseline OCT male population . Computations conduct assume prevalence rupture 82 % male 60 % female patient ( 22 % low ) . Confirmatory power calculation perform basis stent Strut Coverage 9 month follow-up ( co primary endpoint ) . Stent-strut coverage apposition link risk stent thrombosis . However , understand DES heal male female patient ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction restrict post-mortem data . The investigator assume per patient stent strut coverage ( continuous variable right skew distribution ) mean 97.0 % standard deviation 4.0 % men , versus mean 95.0 % standard deviation 4.0 % woman , follow Xience Prime implantation . Thus , aim 5 % 2-tailed superiority alpha , 80 % power , assume 1:1 enrollment accord gender , total 64 patient per group enrol . Anticipating 10 % dropout rate due patient lose follow-up inadequate imaging ( included major side branch section ) , total enrollment set 70 patient per group ( total population 140 subject ) .</detailed_description>
