	<detailed_description>Surgical injury tissue cause variety profound physiologic reaction essential restoration organism ' homeostasis . The inflammatory response involve surge stress hormone ( i.e . ACTH , cortisol , catecholamine ) , activation complement system , migration leukocyte site injury , release cytokine ( i.e . interleukin , tumor necrosis factor ) , well cellular product ( i.e . superoxide radical , protease , growth factor ) ( 1-3 ) . An appropriate inflammatory cascade essential tissue reconstitution infection control . The associated impairment multiple organ function generally mild , physiological reserve biological system . However , systemic inflammatory response may also lead postoperative complication elderly , neonate , patient significant co-morbidity ( 4 , 5 ) . Indeed , mediator inflammation may induce fatigue prolong convalescence healthy patient . On hand , dysregulation suppression inflammatory process may lead improper wound healing , infection , demonstrate recently , even increase cancer recurrence due reduction natural killer cell activity ( 6 , 7 ) . Anesthetic management may affect immunostimulatory immunosuppressive mechanism either directly modulate function immune cell indirectly attenuate stress response . For example , inhalational anesthetic inhibit neutrophil function depress lymphocyte proliferation increase pro-inflammatory cytokine level ( 8 , 9 ) ) . Propofol also inhibit neutrophil monocyte function , strong anti-inflammatory anti-oxidative effect ( 10 ) . Opioids attenuate direct cell immune response , minimal effect systemic inflammatory response ( 11 ) . It expect choice anesthetic technique may disturb balance pro- anti-inflammatory response thus affect clinical outcome . A advantageous anesthetic choice would enhance neutral effect cellular immunity minimize contribution systemic inflammatory response .</detailed_description>
