	<brief_summary>The administration anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen surgery study extensively . Subjects ask participate study schedule surgery investigator want study way improve recovery surgery . Ibuprofen give several time surgery . The investigator ask question determine recovery investigator draw blood determine inflammatory response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Intravenous Ibuprofen Inflammatory Responses Patients Undergoing Surgery With General Anesthesia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human animal study suggest cyclooxygenase-inhibitors ( COX-inhibitors ) decrease production inflammatory mediator . Studies also suggest COX inhibitor attenuate increase corticosterone eicosanoid level endotoxin injection . COX inhibitor also appear anticancer effect , inhibit angiogenesis , tumor growth , metastatic burden . These result suggest role IV ibuprofen prevent untoward inflammatory response , shorten post-surgical convalescence , improve patient satisfaction , reduce rate complication occur recovery surgery . However , study evaluate relationship administration IV ibuprofen , ensue immunomodulation , long-term outcome . Study Objective . The aim propose study examine effect intravenous ( IV ) ibuprofen inflammatory response major surgery . More importantly , investigator correlate change concentration inflammatory mediator meaningful clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
