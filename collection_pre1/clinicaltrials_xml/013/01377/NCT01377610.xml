	<brief_summary>The investigator randomize 210 opioid-dependent participant one two outpatient detoxification strategy : ( 1 ) standard 7-day buprenorphine induction gradual taper 8 mg 0 mg vs. ( 2 ) 7-day oral naltrexone induction ; group receive single administration Vivitrol injection : Day 8 naltrexone induction group Day 15 buprenorphine group . The naltrexone arm modification current inpatient naltrexone induction procedure , consist single day buprenorphine follow washout day 4 day ascend oral naltrexone dos , prior administer dose injectable naltrexone Day 8 . All participant receive intensive behavioral therapy five week follow subsequent 8 week assess longer-term outcome initial treatment . The primary outcome percentage patient group successfully induct onto Vivitrol . Key secondary outcome 2-week abstinence Weeks 4-5 ( 3rd 4th week Vivitrol injection ) , rate completion 8-day detoxification , percentage patient group return additional Vivitrol injection post-study follow-up . The main goal Stage 1a pilot study develop improved outpatient opioid detoxification strategy , particular relevance newly diagnose heroin addict prescription opioid abuser seek long-term agonist maintenance . Specific Aim # 1 : To develop procedure outpatient opioid detoxification include naltrexone facilitate detoxification . Specific Aim # 2 : To compare injectable naltrexone induction rate naltrexone buprenorphine group follow short-term outpatient opioid detoxification approach initiate treatment opioid dependence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose randomize , parallel-groups 5-week study relapse prevention detoxify opioid-dependent individual . This trial represent initial test feasibility efficacy outpatient opioid detoxification strategy employ induction onto long-acting naltrexone ( Vivitrol ) , combination recently adapt version Behavioral Naltrexone Therapy Depot Naltrexone ( Depot-BNT ) . Participants randomize one two outpatient detoxification strategy : ( 1 ) standard 7-day buprenorphine induction taper 8 mg 0 mg ( N=33 ) , follow Day 15 naloxone challenge dose long-acting injectable naltrexone ( Vivitrol ) ( consistent FDA-approved recommendation 7 day last opioid dose Vivitrol induction ) vs. ( 2 ) modification current inpatient naltrexone induction procedure , consist single day buprenorphine follow washout day 4 day ascend oral naltrexone dos , follow long-acting injectable naltrexone ( Vivitrol ) 380 mg Day 8 ( N=67 ) . We seek obtain Vivitrol sample Alkermes ; successful obtaining sample , offer participant complete study second injection 4 week first , third injection offer Week 12 . All participant receive intensive behavioral therapy five week follow 24 week assess long-term outcome initial treatment . Study assessment collect baseline study visit ( twice weekly Weeks 2-5 ; weekly Weeks 6-9 participant receive second Vivitrol injection participate follow-up care ) . Repeated assessment also complete one four month follow end treatment . The primary aim study test hypothesis outpatient opioid detoxification strategy use naltrexone increase likelihood successful induction onto long-acting injectable naltrexone , compare buprenorphine taper opioid-dependent patient . The primary outcome measure percentage treatment group ( oral naltrexone vs. buprenorphine taper ) receive Vivitrol injection Day 8 15 . Key secondary outcome : two-week opioid abstinence Weeks 4-5 , retention 8-day detoxification procedure ( time dropout ) severity opiate withdrawal first 5 week treatment . We anticipate outpatient opioid detoxification method develop project uniquely suit need rapidly expand population prescription opioid-abusing individual seek alternative opioid agonist maintenance . The current proposal also yield important data improve long-term outcome buprenorphine taper method opioid detoxification , addition long-acting naltrexone .</detailed_description>
