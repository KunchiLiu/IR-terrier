	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine outcome drug combination treatment detoxify stabilized methamphetamine ( METH ) and/or cocaine ( COC ) dependent user . The combination regimen consist oral administration generic immediate-release methylphenidate ( MPh-IR ) formulation ( e.g. , Ritalin® ) novel delay , pulsatile-release formulation antiemetic ondansetron ( Ond-PR002 ) . Various psychological assessment tool functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) use assess treatment outcome . In addition treatment outcome measure , determine whether 14-day , once-a-day treatment lead significant change pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic ( PK/PD ) , safety tolerability parameter MPh-IR and/or Ond-PR002 formulation drug-drug interaction two drug .</brief_summary>
