	<brief_title>Pazopanib Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pazopanib , tyrosine kinase inhibitor target VEGFR1/2/3 , PDGFR alpha &amp; beta , c-KIT , FGFR1/3 inhibit angiogenesis . The phase II trial advance RCC ( previous cytokine therapy 25 % patient ) yield good clinical benefit ( response rate 34.6 % ; disease control 79.8 % ) durable activity ( progression-free near 1 year ) acceptable toxicity . The randomized phase III trial advance RCC ongoing interim analysis reveal prolonged progression-free survival pazopanib group compare placebo group . Pazopanib active multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor need broaden new indication treat cancer . VEGF-C FGF pathways also important angiogenesis , metastasis , invasion , cancer stem cell renewal HNSCC . Pazopanib also inhibit two pathway might offer much suppression tumor angiogenesis growth HNSCC compare sunitinib . Common side effect pazopanib grade I II diarrhea , hypertension , hair color change , nausea , manageable . Because advantageous activity VEGF-C FGF pathways favorable toxicity profile compare sunitinib , plan phase II trial pazopanib cisplatin-refractory recurrent metastatic HNSCC . Serum inflammation marker , like IL-6 ( esp . inflammation- mediated cancer , like virus- related hepatocellular carcinoma HNSCC ) , host/tumor VEGF/VEGFR2 polymorphism attract much attention tumor angiogenesis dependence response prediction anti-angiogenesis treatment , addition previously describe sVEGFR2 circulate endothelial progenitor ( CEP ) phase II trial RCC . We study serum IL-6/VEGF/sVEGFR2/CEP host/tumor VEGF/VEGFR2 polymorphism prognosis response correlation .</detailed_description>
