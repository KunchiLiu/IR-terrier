	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) frequent primitive tumour liver . Although histological examination remain reference diagnosis , may difficult obtain biopsy material difficulty get lesion due small size . However , know size lesion remain major prognostic factor , imply need early detection , enhance chance curative treatment.PET enables study change glucidic lipidic metabolism cancer cell . PET-CT , provide metabolic anatomic information , improve performance technique . PET 18F-FDG sensitive enough detection HCC , except case low grade . Recently , several research study report 11C-choline PET show high detection rate well differentiate HCC , early stage primary liver cancer . The study include 30 patient present suspicion HCC without cirrhosis . Each patient examine two conventional image technique , consist dynamic magnetic resonance imaging compute tomography ; alpha fetoprotein measurement take . PET-CT acquire intravenous injection 11C-choline . The 11C-choline PET-CT performance HCC diagnosis compare histological analysis obtain tumoral liver biopsy , use American Association study Liver Disease diagnostic criterion . In absence two criterion , follow within one year serve reference .</detailed_description>
