	<brief_summary>Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) account 60 % death coronary artery disease . The annual incidence OHCA treat Emergency Medical Systems ( EMS ) 41-89 per 100,000 population . Outcome OHCA cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) poor : Less 1/3 victim regain spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) , 40-60 % achieve ROSC suffer significant neurological disability due brain hypoxia 1.7-6.4 % discharged hospital . In order minimize hypoxia time , primary goal CPR achieve return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) fast possible . Metabolic ( lactic ) acidosis develop rapidly CA consider detrimental CPR outcome . Sodium bicarbonate ( SB ) , generic , commonly use acid buffer , subject single , small , prospective control trial find trend towards improve outcome prolonged OHCA CPR . Another study indicate EMS 's use SB early often CPR significantly high ROSC rate well long-term outcome compare EMS 's used SB seldom administer late course CPR . Aim Study : To determine whether early administration SB OHCA CPR improve short-term CPR outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General : Prospective , randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial . Exception Informed Consent , regulation conduction research emergency situation , approve Helsinki Committee Rambam Medical Center Supreme Helsinki Committee Israeli Ministry Health . Included adult patient suffer OHCA , respond basic CPR early defibrillation advance CPR initiate . 1st dose ( 1 mEq/Kg ) SB/placebo administer Israeli Magen David Adom ( MDA ) advance life support ( ALS ) team immediately follow first IV epinephrine . SB/placebo vial syrinx mask cod . Calculated sample size 2130 patient . Study endpoint include short-term outcome variable - rate ROSC admission emergency room . Expected result : Based previous analysis expect 20 % improved short-term outcome SB treat group . Sample size calculate accordingly . Importance : Around 2.2 million OHCA 's treated EMS worldwide annually . Current ROSC rate ca . 30 % . A 20 % good short-term outcome result 130,000 additional patient regain spontaneous circulation annually . Probable implication Medicine : The use SB CPR controversial . Current International Guidelines CPR present reserve recommendation regard SB use . Results study may direct impact Guidelines conduction CPR world-wide . Based result trial , Phase II trial , research effect early SB administration long-term outcome ( hospital discharge final neurological outcome ) may warrant conduct .</detailed_description>
