	<brief_summary>Uveal melanoma common primary intra-ocular malignancy adult incidence 0.6 - 0.7 per 100,000 per year . Prognosis metastatic uveal melanoma poor . In retrospective analysis median survival time detection metastases 5 month ( Flaherty et al , 1998 ) 7 month ( Kath et al , 1993 ) report . For patient receive treatment report median survival 2.0 month compare 5.2 month receive treatment metastasis ( Gragoudas et al , 1991 ) . Up establish treatment metastatic uveal melanoma . Some therapeutic approach locoregional treatment systemic chemotherapy undertaken : In case metastatic disease confine liver 85 % patient uveal melanoma surgical resection lead median survival 14 month ( Mariani et al , 2009 ) 19 month 5-year survival rate 22 % select patient population ( Adam et al , 2006 ) . As locoregional treatment option treatment fotemustine via direct intra-arterial hepatic infusion investigate led median survival 15 month ( Peters et al , 2006 ) . This randomized trial , report 101 consecutive treat patient . Additional debulking surgery perform whenever feasible . A randomized phase III trial compare intra-arterial hepatic fotemustine administration intravenous systemic fotemustine overall survival primary endpoint still ongoing ( EORTC 18021 ) . Thus , systemic chemotherapy approve metastatic uveal melanoma . Although specific gene link pathogenesis uveal melanoma , preclinical study suggest potential benefit inhibitor Bcl-2 , ubiquitin-proteasome , histone deactylase , mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT pathway , receptor tyrosine kinase . Thus , sorafenib inhibitor b-Raf Raf-1 ( c-Raf c-Raf-1 ) , pro-angiogenic vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) may potentially lead benefit patient metastatic uveal melanoma term disease control prolongation survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Sorafenib Patients With Chemonaive Metastatic Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale treatment uveal melanoma sorafenib Improved understanding molecular pathogenesis cancer lead new generation therapeutic agent interfere specific pathway critical tumor development progression . Although specific gene link pathogenesis uveal melanoma , significantly differ cutaneous melanoma , progress make identify potential target involve uveal melanoma apoptosis , proliferation , invasion , metastasis , angiogenesis . Accordingly , improvement systemic therapy metastatic uveal melanoma could achieve use molecularly target agent currently clinical use well agent test clinical trial . Preclinical study suggest potential benefit inhibitor Bcl-2 , ubiquitin-proteasome , histone deactylase , mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT pathway , receptor tyrosine kinase . Modifiers adhesion molecule , matrix metalloproteinase , angiogenic factor also demonstrate potential benefit . ( Triozzi et al , 2008 ) . Thus , sorafenib oral multi-kinase inhibitor target Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathway ( CRAF , BRAF , V600E BRAF ) cell receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 , PDGFR-ß involve tumor cell proliferation angiogenesis may potentially lead benefit patient metastatic uveal melanoma term disease control prolongation survival . In GCP-adapted register trial approve ethic committee Essen 62 patient metastatic uveal melanoma receive treatment sorafenib compassionate use basis . Median overall survival 10.8 month patient receive 200 mg bid sorafenib 7.1 month patient receive 400 mg bid ( Scheulen et al , 2011 ) . These treatment result encouraging investigation treatment sorafenib patient metastatic uveal melanoma randomize trial , potential benefit systemic treatment anticipate . Rationale selection randomize discontinuation trial design The randomized discontinuation trial ( RDT ) design , first propose 1975 ( Amery et al , 1975 ) aim assess clinical activity drug minimizing use placebo . All patient receive study drug initial run-in period , follow random assignment potential responder either study drug placebo ( Amery et al,1975 ; Kopec et al,1993 ) . RDT design provide homogeneous study treatment group select patient predefined response , allow evaluation drug 's clinical activity few patient increase statistical power . Thus study design especially useful distinguish anticancer activity drug natural history underlying disease ( Kopec et al,1993 ; Jain L et al , 2006 ; Rosner et al , 2002 ) . As pointed Rosner RDT design feasible phase II study design evaluate possible activity cytostatic anticancer agent whereas historically anticancer drug efficacy evaluate cytotoxic ( Rosner et al , 2002 ) . As laid section 3.2 sorafenib oral multi-kinase inhibitor target Raf/MEK/ERK signal pathway cell receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 , PDGFR-ß involve tumor cell proliferation angiogenesis . The primary clinical benefit sorafenib expect disease stabilization rather tumor shrinkage . As disease stabilization substantially influence natural disease disease , RDT design choose several phase II trial evaluate possible activity sorafenib ( Ratain et al , 2006 ; Eisen et al , 2006 ; Pacey et al , 2009 ) Taking account uveal melanoma rare disease presumably unidentified prognostic factor RDT design seem useful objective evaluation time progression overall survival . The RDT design ensure patient receive treatment sorafenib run-in phase 8 week receive treatment sorafenib experience response ( complete response partial response ) . Patients experience tumor progression run-in phase remain study may offer alternative treatment . Patients experience tumor stabilization ( stable disease ) randomize double-blinded either sorafenib placebo . Tumor response assessment perform every 8 week , case progression patient unblinded offer retreatment sorafenib randomize placebo . Thus , patient experience progression , effective maximum duration possible placebo application confine eight week . Risk-benefit assessment treatment patient metastatic uveal melanoma sorafenib Based rationale treatment patient metastatic uveal melanoma sorafenib clinical experience limit number patient metastatic uveal melanoma treat sorafenib compassionate use basis ( section 3.3 ) , potential benefit systemic treatment anticipate . Major potential side effect continuous oral treatment sorafenib hand-foot-syndrome , diarrhoea increase blood pressure effectively reduce either dose reduction cessation treatment sorafenib case hand-foot-syndrome diarrhoea antihypertonic agent case increase blood pressure . Further , administration sorafenib ( oral intake ) mean few hospitalization thus constitute improvement quality life . Thus , treatment sorafenib potentially effective treatment patient metastatic uveal melanoma without serious side effect . In case short-term evaluation inappropriate antitumor efficacy patient option alternative treatment strategy either intra-arterial liver perfusion fotemustine melphalan case metastatic disease confine liver salvage chemotherapy . However noted treatment represent establish authorized alternative treatment option . The randomized phase III trial compare intra-arterial hepatic fotemustine administration intravenous systemic fotemustine regard overall survival primary endpoint still ongoing ( EORTC 18021 ) , experience base small phase II trial individual treatment decision describe section 3.1 . Any locoregional treatment surgery intra-arterial hepatic infusion fotemustine mephalan require patient suffer disseminate metastasis liver extrahepatic localisation metastasis . Any placement intra-arterial catheter lower extent , intravenous catheter associate risk catheter thrombosis , dislocation , catheter stenosis/obstruction leakage . The main serious side effect melphalan fotemustine myelotoxicity anemia , leucopenia thrombocytopenia risk develop acute leucemia , gastrointestinal toxicity nausea , vomit diarrhoea , allergic reaction , alopecia , interstitial pneumonia , liver function disorder renal function disorder . Considering poor prognosis metastatic uveal melanoma take account lack establish treatment treat metastatic uveal melanoma , risk-benefit relation study assess positive . The possible benefit achieve disease control sorafenib outweighs risk possible side effect sorafenib . Alternative treatment option likewise subject investigation , probably serious side effect certainly affect quality life far result intraarterial/intravenous infusional application contrast oral intake sorafenib .</detailed_description>
