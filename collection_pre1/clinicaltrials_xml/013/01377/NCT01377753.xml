	<brief_summary>Background : - One way treat prostate cancer use laser direct extreme heat small area prostate . The heat destroy tumor cell affect healthy tissue . Doctors want see magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use improve treatment . MRI use help locate tumor cell guide laser surgery . However , MRI-guided laser therapy use treat many people prostate cancer . More study need see whether destroy tumor cell permanently . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness treat prostate tumor laser therapy guide magnetic resonance imaging . Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age prostate cancer see MRI spread part body . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also blood test image study , complete questionnaire health . - Participants MRI-guided laser treatment hospital . The doctor use MRI control much energy deliver laser much tissue destroy . The entire procedure usually take 1.5 3 hour . - After treatment , participant catheter put keep bladder empty . The catheter stay 1 7 day . Drugs prevent infection bladder spasms give . Participants leave hospital well enough go home . - Participants followup visit 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36 month therapy . They physical exam , blood urine test . They also answer questionnaire . Participants MRI scan 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 month therapy . They prostate biopsy see tumor every 12 month first 2 year . Another biopsy may do third year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Pilot study design evaluate safety feasibility thermal laser ablation focal prostate tumor . - Prostate cancer relatively slow growing , double time local tumor estimate 2 4 year . - Some prostate cancer prove small , low grade , noninvasive appear pose little risk life health host . Recent patient series suggest 20 % 30 % men undergo radical prostatectomy pathologic feature radical prostatectomy specimen consistent insignificant indolent cancer pose little threat life health . - We propose patient low volume low grade disease best serve focal ablation visible prostate cancer without side effect urinary incontinence erectile dysfunction associate radiation therapy radical surgery . Objectives : Primary Objective : -To determine feasibility safety magnetic resonance image-guided focal laser ablation biopsy confirm MR visible prostate cancer . Secondary Objective : - To evaluate tolerability treatment - To determine change image biopsy characteristic thermal ablation localize prostate cancer - To obtain preliminary data , follow-up study , regard effect thermal ablation use Visualase short long term complication rate . - To compare Visualase estimate thermal damage post contrast MRI image . - Determine outcome laser ablation treatment prostate cancer use serial PSA , PSA density , change image , IPSS , SHIM . Eligibility : - Greater 18 year age - Organ confine prostate cancer , observe MR , confirm Transrectal biopsy - Preoperative workup dictate NCCN.org prostate cancer guideline - PSA &lt; 15 ng PSA density &lt; 0.15 ng/ml patient PSA &gt; 15 ng Design : - Pilot study , test feasibility , safety tolerability thermal ablation focal prostate cancer - It anticipate 15 patient accrue study</detailed_description>
