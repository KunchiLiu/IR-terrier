	<brief_title>A Dose-escalating Study Evaluate Immunogenicity Safety Rotavin-M1 Vaccine Healthy Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rotavirus ( RV ) important cause acute gastroenteritis child worldwide . In Vietnam rotavirus cause estimate 122,000-140,000 hospitalization 2900-5400 death per year among child 5 year age ( 1 ) . Over past 13 year , sentinel hospital surveillance identify rotavirus 44 % -62 % child admit treatment acute diarrhea Vietnam ( 2-4 ) . Such high burden disease justify accelerate development new locally manufacture vaccine rotavirus Vietnam . It estimate vaccine introduce current childhood immunization schedule , could reduce severe rotavirus disease 60 % give current vaccine efficacy coverage ( 5 ) . The Government Vietnam pursue policy encourage local vaccine production country could self-reliant affordable vaccine population ( 6 ) . Over past decade , several locally produce vaccine poliomyelitis , cholera , Japanese encephalitis , Diphtheria-Pertussis-Tetanus contribute reduction prevalence diseases eradication polio past decade . While two commercial rotavirus vaccine , RotarixTM ( GSK , Belgium ) RotaTeqÂ® ( Merck ) , test Vietnam , neither currently available affordable cost national program . Therefore , candidate vaccine , Rotavin-M1 , develop order fill need affordable vaccine Vietnamese child ( 6 ) . This vaccine similar RotarixTM , develop select common G1P [ 8 ] strain attenuate serial passage plaque purification qualify Vero cell GLP condition .</detailed_description>
