	<brief_summary>We propose pilot telehealth approach evaluate component risk communication : 1 . Providing personalized tailored patient feedback help initiate maintain specific diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) -related behavior ( e.g. , medication adherence , weight , exercise , diet , smoke cessation ) reduce risk . 2 . Evaluating feedback incorporate clinical care examine 6 month patient outcomes . Specific Aims : 1 . To evaluate feasibility acceptability provide patient provider feedback individual ' DKD risk via telehealth intervention incorporate regular clinical practice . 2 . If improvement outcomes find , estimate cost program term patient , provider , overall cost implement program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We propose innovative telehealth approach reduce antecedent kidney disease , include poor blood pressure glucose control , never use treat DKD . To mitigate grow burden DKD , study design determine whether potentially scalable , telehealth intervention effectively slow progression DKD diverse US population whether also cost-effective . The intervention simultaneously address medication management behavioral therapy education seek optimize adherence self-efficacy . This propose pilot trial begin evaluate multifactorial telehealth intervention may effective reduce progression DKD .</detailed_description>
