	<brief_title>Somatostatin In Patients With Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease And Moderate To Severe Renal Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ( ADPKD ) , common hereditary cystic renal disease , incidence 1 800 live birth account 7-10 % patient dialysis develop country . Clinically , ADPKD characterize renal extra renal manifestation . In kidney , multiple cyst grow distal collect tubular epithelial cell produce progressive renal enlargement relatively initial stable renal function . Thereafter , tubular secondary interstitial damage lead faster renal loss end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) approximately half patient affect fifth sixth decade life . More 50 % patient display hepatic cyst derive cholangiocyte proliferation fluid secretion . Pancreatic intestinal cyst well increase risk aortic aneurysm , heart-valve defect sudden death due rupture intracerebral aneurysms extra-renal manifestation . Patients ADPKD , similar level proteinuria blood pressure control , seem benefit extent ACE inhibitor therapy faster decline glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) compare chronic kidney disease . Thus , ADPKD renoprotective intervention - addition achieve maximal reduction arterial blood pressure proteinuria , limit effect potential disease progression promoter ( dyslipidemia , chronic hyperglycemia , smoke ) - also specifically aim correct dysregulation epithelial cell growth , fluid secretion , extracellular matrix deposition characteristic disease . Up , specific therapy ADPKD available , drug like somatostatin , rapamycin , tolvaptan target growth chloride secretion pathways test worldwide clinical trial . We perform year ago pilot prospective cross-over control study long-acting somatostatin analog patient ADPKD different degree renal dysfunction . We find patient , 6 month treatment octreotide safe , well tolerate , slow time-dependent increase total kidney volume significant extent compare placebo . The net effect kidney volume result action drug cyst volume parenchyma volume . Moreover , recent post-hoc analysis concomitant liver disease progression ADPKD patient demonstrate significant reduction total liver volume octreotide treatment , appreciably observe placebo . Moreover , untreated ADPKD patient enrol study , compute tomography evaluation disease progression show ratio faintly contrast-enhanced parenchyma volume total parenchyma volume strongly correlate basal GFR GFR change observation period . The good safety profile octreotide slow renal growth demonstrate short-term clinical study suggest feasibility randomize trial large series ADPKD patient normal renal function mild renal insufficiency verify whether long-term somatostatin treatment may eventually provide effective renoprotection . This trial - ALADIN study - ongoing plan ADPKD patient enrol . So far , particular side effect report . More important , preliminary interim analysis data patient reach 1 year treatment , confirm beneficial effect octreotide slow growth total kidney volume compare placebo . The finding safety potential benefit octreotide patient severe renal insufficiency observe initial pilot study encourage preliminary long-term effect result octreotide kidney growth , make worth investigate efficacy long-acting somatostatin ( Octreotide LAR ) slow even halt kidney enlargement renal function decline ADPKD patient moderate/severe renal failure .</detailed_description>
