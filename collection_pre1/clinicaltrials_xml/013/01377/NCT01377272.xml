	<brief_summary>Data extract National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) medical record database , geocoded accord street address case number , incidence , etc could map . The spatial data would use detect aggregation HIV case , existence `` hot spot '' determine may merit investigation may occur chance . The result GIS-based analysis would address local variation HIV prevalence transmission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The transmission rout human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) well know many control program focus risk group behavior undertake . However , risk factor HIV transmission individual level ( eg : demographic , behavior , genetic risk factor ) , socioeconomic environmental factor also take important role . In Taiwan , research explored spatial distribution HIV infection . Studies country observe significant geographic variation HIV infection . To understand spatial pattern HIV infection depth , present study aim retrospectively investigate epidemiological geographic characteristic HIV infection use medical record database National Taiwan University Hospital . A Geographic information system ( GIS ) spatial statistic use analyze geographic pattern determine whether spatial dispersion cluster . There two aim study . One investigate epidemiology HIV infection Taipei City . The second analyze spatial characterizes HIV infection , include disease mapping , geographic correlation study , identify presence HIV cluster potential spatial risk factor . In addition , want examine whether different distribution different classificatory group . Finally , hope finding would give direction local health policy planner improve HIV intervention prevention strategy</detailed_description>
