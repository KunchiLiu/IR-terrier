	<detailed_description>Nicotine dependence important public health problem contribute significant morbidity mortality society . Treatment effort hamper high relapse rate , despite development somewhat effective treatment modality , Nicotine Replacement Treatment ( NRT ) . NRT , e.g . nicotine patch , successful smoking cessation , compensate nicotine withdrawal quit smoking . However , relapse rate remain high even quitter patch . It think craving relate smoke cue contribute relapse smoker patch try quit . Rational treatment approach nicotine dependence therefore include strategy weaken effect smoking cue , e.g . cue extinction training ( CET ) . During CET smoker repeatedly expose smoking cue , absence nicotine administration , smoker report lessen cue-induced craving ( extinction ) . It think extinction smoking cue result less control smoking cue smoking behavior low relapse rate . The investigator hypothesize smoke quit rate patch high CET . To address hypothesis investigator first want develop proof concept procedure demonstrate repeat cue exposure laboratory result lessen 'extinction ' cue-induced craving . In addition , investigator interested contribution nicotine withdrawal cue-induced craving . To end , investigator propose include control group without nicotine replacement ( i.e . placebo patch ) also undergo repeat cue exposure procedure . This study assess effect CET subsequent craving trigger smoke cue cigarette-smoking volunteer . After overnight abstinence , participant come lab , receive patch ( nicotine placebo ) undergo CET procedure perform computer test fill questionnaire . The main goal project study relationship nicotine replacement , cue-extinction training subsequent cue-induced craving . Showing effectiveness cue-extinction training propose laboratory model support application cue-extinction procedure improve relapse rate nicotine replacement therapy future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
