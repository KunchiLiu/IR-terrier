	<brief_summary>The purpose trial determine whether particular type Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) , schedule Deep Brain stimulation ( SBS ) , effective safe treatment Tourettte syndrome ( TS ) . The trial also examine brain activity associate TS tic explore possibility responsive brain stimulation ( RBS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DBS surgical procedure seek change brain 's electrical signalling mean applied electrical current . To end , wire tiny stimulate electrode implant one side brain . An electrode small piece metal use take electric current power source . These electrode connect skin scalp small electrical unit call INS ( implantable neurostimulator ) , similar heart pacemaker . The device send electrical impulse appear change normal flow electricity brain . The wire house electrode implant side brain orient towards centromedian thalamus-parafascicular complex . This region brain date great number document case reveal significant improvement motor tic . This region brain also provide target physiological change relate motor tic likely discover . The device propose study several feature make suitable use TS population device . It self-contained skull brain , contain tunneled neck connector wire chest pacemaker deice . This help lessen infection , assist limit device-related fracture due tic involve neck region . Also , system record electro-encephalograph data area electrode , assist u gather information specific physiological change correlate tic .</detailed_description>
