	<brief_summary>The Fragile X syndrome ( FXS ) first describe Dr. Martin Dr. Bell 1943 , family several patient affect sex-linked mental disability . This disorder common cause inherited mental disability . The prevalence Fragile X syndrome establish 1 2,500 male 1 4000 female . Despite moderate severe mental retardation , fragile X patient exhibit macroorchidism , elongate face , long ear , connective tissue dysplasia , hyperactivity , autistic-like stereotypical behaviour , speech delay increase sensory sensitivity . Objective : To evaluate effect combination antioxidant Ascorbic acid tocopherol , therapy Fragile X Syndrome young male . Hypothesis : It propose part pathophysiology central nervous system animal model fragile X syndrome may determine oxidative stress . In addition , Fragile X patient show significantly low level ascorbic acid plasma . The biochemical characteristic oxidative stress may reverse FMR1-KO mouse , chronic treatment antioxidant compound tocopherol melatonin , may also normalize several hallmark Syndrome hyperactivity , anxiety cognitive deficit . The normalization oxidative stress propose new therapeutic pathway alleviate condition cause excess free radical crucial neurodevelopmental disease autism , syndrome disease central nervous system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Objective : To evaluate effect combination antioxidant Ascorbic acid tocopherol , therapy Fragile X Syndrome young male . - Design : Pilot clinical trial , Phase II , 6-month randomize , double-blind placebo-controlled one-way crossover clinical trial , two treatment period 12 week duration . - Setting : IMABIS Foundation . Carlos Haya Hospital , Malaga . - Subjects : Children age 5-11 year ( infant ) 12-18 year ( adolescent ) diagnose Fragile X syndrome . - Intervention : 30 participant randomly assign , receive antioxidant vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) vitamin E ( d-alpha-tocopherol ) day placebo 12 week double-blind . In Study Period 2 , participant receive ( open ) active treatment . Outcome measure : improvement plasma antioxidant level , oxidative stress ( indicate glutathione status , thiobarbituric acid react substance ( TBARS ) carbonyl content protein ) HPA axis response . Behavioral problem study use `` Developmental behavior checklist '' `` Teacher ` ParentÂ´s Questionnaire , C. Keith Conners '' , also learn improvement analyze use `` Wechsler Intelligence Scale child '' 0 , 3 , 6 month trial 3 month complete treatment .</detailed_description>
