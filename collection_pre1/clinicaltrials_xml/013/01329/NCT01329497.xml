	<brief_summary>Hyperphosphatemia highly prevalent PD patient , independent risk factor all-cause cardiovascular mortality patient . Effective treatment limit suppress plasma phosphorous . Because nearly linear relationship protein phosphorus intake , high dietary protein intake ( DPI , 1.2-1.3g/kg/d recommend KDOQI ) would load high phosphorus burden PD patient . It suggest hyperphosphatemia hard avoid DPI level , even patient take sufficient phosphorus blinder receive high PD dosage . The present study investigate whether systemic dietary instruction would show effect control hyperphosphatemia PD patient .</brief_summary>
