	<detailed_description>Subject propose project offer base exist theoretical principle method stage-related , reproducible , relevant everyday life group training German people aMCI slightly severe AD compare - term goal variables - less effective prestigious intervention . It believe `` active treatment '' - intervention group , overall level functioning longer maintain positive transfer effect non-cognitive level - achieve cognitive level - national . In addition , information expect conversion rate people dementia aMCI cut loss independence human delay slightly severe AD . The project aim provide data estimate effect size intervention determine basis group size duration ongoing investigation . Involving functional imaging measure , intervention study , adequate platform detection intervention effect neurobiological basis use fMRI dar . Here , cerebral blood flow specific activation measure neuronal synaptic activity integrity cross-section subsample healthy elderly people study determine change cerebral activity pattern people severe AD , aMCI slightly comparison pre-/post intervention . There detectable much early pathogenesis functional change structural , use fMRI , study make significant contribution prove whether modular cognitive intervention alter neural synaptic activity whether change accompany improvement cognitive performance . A complete proven effectiveness cognitive group training could make significant contribution people MCI severe AD easily submit initiative mental condition , add sustain intellectual , emotional social potential . As long-term perspective , result optimization cognitive intervention program continue implement organization open contribute stationary elderly specialize medical facility medical facility .</detailed_description>
