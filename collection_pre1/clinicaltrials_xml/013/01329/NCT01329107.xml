The disease frequent among 50 80-year-olds case approximately 70 year old [ 1 ] . Recent study show incidence bladder cancer increase Europe [ 2 ] . Cystectomy one comprehensive surgical procedure urology [ 3,4 ] . In Denmark , average post-operative length stay ( LOS ) 19 day 2005 ; hospital mortality rate 3.7 % 58 % complicated course disease . The mortality comparable experience abroad [ 3,5 ] . LOS , however , long compare high-volume hospital well-defined clinical patient pathway [ 1,5,6 ] . Major surgery cause pain stress-induced catabolism lead unwanted metabolic inflammatory response , impaired organ function risk thrombosis . These condition increase risk lose muscle mass reduce activity level [ 2 ] . Overall , above-mentioned circumstance delay rehabilitation process . The concept `` fast-track surgery '' multi-modal inter-professional approach reduce post-surgical morbidity optimise post-surgical rehabilitation [ 7,8 ] . The multi-modal approach comprise pre-operative optimisation organ function , patient education , effective pain management , early post-operative mobilisation early oral nutrition [ 9 ] . The concept proven effective , though primarily document connection colorectal surgery [ 9-11,12,13 , ] , increase survival , reduce LOS reduced cost compare conventional patient pathway [ 14,15 ] . The combination major surgical intervention increase number elderly comorbid patient bladder cancer pose challenge treatment care phase patient pathway . The study primarily focus pre- post-operative effort . Evidence sparse concern importance optimise pre-operative effort rehabilitation [ 11 ] . It hypothesise optimised patient pathway call inter-professional pre-operative clinical evaluation pre-optimisation patient 's general condition include nutrition physical activity [ 11,16-18 ] . There low evidence efficacy multi-modal pre-optimisation effort major surgical procedure urology [ 2,19 ] . Especially concern importance multi-facilitated pre-operative intervention rehabilitation health-related quality life [ 7,8 ] . Generally , post-operative effect concern early nutritional intervention LOS [ 20 ] . Early nutritional intervention increase number patient fulfil threshold sufficient nutritional status [ 15,21 ] . Nutrition strategy increasingly combined physical training consist exercise increase muscle strength endurance , increase hypertrophy muscle cell increase muscle protein synthesis reduce disintegration [ 22 ] . Thus , pre-operative multi-modal intervention involve nutritional optimisation physical training part future study . A muli-modal patient pathway involve expectation increase risk economic burden shift primary sector [ 23 ] , increase frequency readmission , complication reduce quality life . This thesis investigate efficacy pre- post-operative multi-modal intervention rehabilitation patient bladder cancer undergo cystectomy . Material : All patient undergo cystectomy Aarhus University Hospital 2009 fulfil inclusion criterion . Study A . To investigate efficacy pre- post-operative multi-modal intervention bladder cancer patient refer radical cystectomy The following hypothesis test : - An inter-professional multi-modal pre- post-operative intervention promote rehabilitation reduces length stay - The intervention group obtain high functional activity level compare control group - The intervention group obtain well management urinary diversion compare control group Material method : Primary endpoint : LOS define number post-operative day ( 7 define discharge criterion fulfil ) . The outcome data present approximately 12 month inclusion close Secondary endpoint : - complication ( measure discharge 120 day postoperatively average ) - Activity functional level ( measure every day admission 120 day discharge ) .Pfysical parametres like bioimpedance , musclepower handgrip strength measure baseline ( two week operation , one day operation , discharge 120 day operation arm ) - Patient-experienced quality admission ( measure EORTC-questionaire discharge arm ) Informations present approximately 12 month inclusion close - Health-related quality life measure baseline 120 day operation ( EORTC questionaire ) . - Management urinary diversion measure baseline , operation,35 day 120 day operation.A validate stoma score scale patient stoma skills used.The outcome data present approximately 12 month inclusion close Sample size . The study population calculate basis LOS patient undergo cystectomy Department Urology , Aarhus University Hospital , Skejby 2008 . Average LOS 13 day standard deviation 4.75 day . Risk type 1 error 5 % 2-sided analysis strength 80 % . Lowest relevant difference effect 20 % reduction LOS intervention group . When 2-sided comparison make , 92 patient include ; 46 intervention control group , respectively.Written information study forward patient along appointment uro-oncological evaluation . Randomisation : Performed 14-17 day prior surgery . When decide surgery patient receive oral information examination . After time deliberation give informed consent , patient randomise outpatient consultation follow uro-oncological evaluation . Monitoring : Demographic clinical background variable register baseline . Follow-up 4 month . Data collect analysis 1-year follow-up ( appendix 1.1-1.5 ) . All patient undergo nutritional screening baseline NRS [ 32,33 ] . Patients age-adjusted score &lt; 3 receive supplement accord standard criterion [ 25-28 ] . Energy demand calculate weight x100x1.3 KJ /day . Protein need calculate weight x 1.5 gram protein/day . Fluid need calculate weight x 30 ml/day [ 30 ] . Comorbidity score use Charlson index score , pain nausea use VAS-score [ 32,33 ] .Habitual intestinal function score use Bristol scale [ 34 ] . Physical activity level estimate baseline use Physical Activity Scale ( PAS ) [ 35 ] . Daily mobilisation time walk distance register pre-operatively admission use pedometer [ 36,37 ] . Ability perform personal activity daily live evaluate daily admission use KATZ score [ 38 ] . Muscle power , muscle strength body composition register baseline , pre-operatively , discharge 35 , 120 ( 365 ) day post-operatively . Muscle power ( force x velocity ) evaluate leg extensor power Rig [ 39 ] ; Isometric muscle strength ( hand grip strength ) evaluate `` Good Muscle Strength '' [ 40 ] body composition evaluate bioimpedance [ 41 ] Progression management urinary diversion evaluate categorial scale ( appendix 1.4 ) . Standard treatment : Patients eat normally operation . The rectal ampulla empty even surgery . From midnight patient fast drink two glass sweet juice 06.00 operation . TED stocking use prevent thrombosis per- post-operatively mobilisation criterion meet . 5000 IU Fragmin inject subcutaneously day 0 . Individual prescription make patient sclerotic disease . Per-operative infection prophylaxis standardise . Sevofluorane use sedative Bupivacain well Ultiva infusion pain management . Epidural catheter use pain treatment th-12-L1 level . The transfusion regime standardise . Pain treatment : Post-operatively - epidurally administer Bupivacain 2.5 mg /ml 5-6 ml / h 3 full day . Peripheral pain treatment tablet paracetamol 1g x 4 day 2 , two tablet Ibuprofen 400 mg x 3 . - Care urinary diversion ; When surgery decide interprofessional meeting concern management stoma neobladder . Stoma marking make day surgery collaboration surgeon , patient stoma care nurse . Relevant aid demonstrate post-operative regime present . - Physiotherapy : Instruction information pulmonary physiotherapy perform pre-operatively . Daily mobilisation shift post-operatively . - Discharge criterion ( see appendix 1.5 ) Intervention In addition , follow initiative make intervention group : - Pre-operative optimisation : The intervention group teach pre-operatively management urinary diversion . Exercise kit hand exercise perform home . Intensive instruction teach provide physiotherapist . Moreover , plan post-operative progressive mobilisation transfer technique . Balancing mutual expectation entire intervention . - Post-operative optimisation : Intensive , structure progressive plan daily mobilisation physical activity day surgery plan discharge 7-9 post-operative day well instruction urinary diversion stoma care nurse . Effect : Expressed difference : LOS , complication , functional activity level management urinary diversion . Statistics : Normally distribute data describe mean , standard deviation ( SD ) 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) test Student 's t-test pair data , unpaired data test unpaired t-test repeat measurement . Non-normally distributed data describe median range test Mann-Whitnew U-test Wilcoxon 's sign rank test . When test 3 variable Friedman test apply . Pearson 's test apply correlation analysis condition meet Spearman 's Rho . Frequencies compare Fischer 's exact test . Associations variable report odds ratio 95 % CI . Study B : Health-related quality life experience patient quality multi-modal intervention Purpose : study effect multi-modal intervention concern patient experience hospital admission health-related quality life ( HeQoL ) . Hypothesis : The intervention group well experience quality high HeQoL . End point : Score concern HeQoL patient experience quality . Material /Method : Same method study population study 2 . Disease-specific questionnaire European Organisation Research Treatment Cancer , EORTC QLQ-BLM30 QLQ-C30 [ 42 ] apply .
