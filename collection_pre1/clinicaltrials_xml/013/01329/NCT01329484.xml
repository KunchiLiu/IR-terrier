	<detailed_description>Reminiscence therapy cognitive training two common non-pharmacological therapy use treat AD . To date , clear evidence regard impact treatment cognitive function people AD . The inconclusive evidence may due methodological limitation , availability limit number control study , lack standardized intervention need sensitive assessment tool . Increasingly , computerized system design support cognitive assessment patient Alzheimer 's disease administration novel non-pharmacological intervention . Studies suggest system may clear benefit . For example , initial study involve patient AD , computerize cognitive training system show value provide standardized approach cognitive training . Also , another study find use computerized system reminiscence therapy successful facilitate patient-caregiver interaction . Our research collaborative effort design test effect two computer-supported intervention patient mild AD . The purpose research compare efficacy personalize computerized reminiscence therapy computerize cognitive training control group . The reminiscence therapy program base develop internet-based personalize reminiscence system , facilitate flexible interactive use patient caregiver . The importance personalize system especially salient immigrant , highly mobile , society due heterogeneous background patient . Separate preliminary study find positive effect system . The research use various measure evaluate efficacy treatment , include Mindstreams ( NeuroTrax Corp. , NJ ) computerize neuropsychological assessment instrument , serve cognitive outcome measure .</detailed_description>
