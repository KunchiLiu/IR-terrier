	<brief_summary>The object study determine benefit follicular flushing double channel needle poor responder population maximum number oocytes retrieve . The investigator compare two method oocyte retrieval without flush . 220 patient undergoing vitro fertilization ( IVF ) Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection ( ICSI ) include . All patient le 5 follicle 14 mm day ovulation induction include , follow randomize protocol two group , Group A : Oocyte retrieval perform single lumen aspiration needle 17G . Group B : Oocyte retrieval perform double lumen aspiration needle 17G . follicle flush flush solution addition direct aspiration follicular fluid , 20CC flush medium provide procedure flush medium collect separately direct fluid aspiration order follow oocyte one one . First criterion comparison number oocyte retrieve . Second criterion : oocyte quality , fertilization rate , number quality embryo obtain , clinical pregnancy rate . In Group B investigator compare two subgroup : oocyte collect flush medium oocyte direct follicle fluid . Then investigator know capability oocyte collect follicular flushing fertilized increase success chance pregnancy poor responder patient .</brief_summary>
