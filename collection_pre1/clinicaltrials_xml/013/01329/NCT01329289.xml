	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm symptomatic MM , SalmonDurie Stage II III , International Staging System II III , fulfill CRAB criterion ( see Appendix A , B ) . Patients previously treat least one cycle bortezomib , patient show progressive refractory disease . Finally , patient must meet least one follow parameter measurable disease : Bone marrow plasmacytosis &gt; 10 % plasma cell , sheet plasma cell , biopsy proven plasmacytoma must obtain within 6 week prior registration . Measurable level monoclonal protein ( Mprotein ) : ≥ 1 g/dL serum protein electrophoresis ( SPEP ) ≥ 200 mg monoclonal light chain 24 hour urine protein electrophoresis ( UPEP ) involve FLC ≥ mg/dL ( ≥ 100 mg/L ) must obtain within 4 week prior registration . Serum urine Mprotein level determine electrophoresis rather quantitative immunoglobulin ( Ig ) measurement . Exceptions make case Mspike value may deem unreliable ( e.g . comigrating Mspike ) . In case , quantitative Ig use . To assess response progression , however , SPEP value compare SPEP value quantitative Ig value quantitative Ig value . Patients must receive least two prior antiMM treatment . The prior treatment must include least one IMiD ( thalidomide lenalidomide ) bortezomib . If patient unable tolerate thalidomide lenalidomide include without prior IMiD treatment . Patients may include experience grade III neuropathy bortezomib . Patients may previously receive autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation . Minimum four week since major surgery , completion radiation , completion prior systemic anticancer therapy . Exception : e.g . kyphoplasty , vertebroplasty , local radiation therapy symptomatic bone lesion ( e.g. , uncontrolled pain high risk pathologic fracture ) . Age ≥ 18 year . Life expectancy great 12 week . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 ( Karnofsky ≥ 60 % ; see Appendix B ) . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define , obtain within 4 week prior registration : Hgb &gt; 9 g/dL ( may support transfusion growth factor ) Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1000 x 109/L Platelets ≥ 50,000 x 109/L PT/PTT &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ( ULN ) Hepatic : Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 ULN Aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase 3 × ULN without liver metastasis 5 × ULN document liver infiltration Renal : Calculated creatinine clearance ≥40 ml/min accord formula Appendix D Cholesterol* ≤ 300 mg/dL Triglycerides ( fast ) * ≤ 2.5 x ULN Fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) ** &lt; 1.5X ULN FPG HbA1c ≤ 8 % *In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . At principle investigator 's discretion , noneligible patient rescreened adequate medical therapy institute . Patients must pregnant breast feeding must negative pregnancy test within 14 day administration first study treatment . Further , woman childbearing potential sexually active male must agree use medically effective contraception method throughout treatment period avoid conception participate study . Women must lactate . Post menopausal patient patient bilateral oophorectomy need take pregnancy test . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patient must inform investigational nature study . Patient able swallow pill Patients chemotherapy , radiotherapy , major surgery within 4 week prior enter study recover AEs due chemotherapy , radiotherapy , major surgery complete 4 week prior registration . Exception : local radiation therapy symptomatic bone lesion ( e.g. , uncontrolled pain high risk pathologic fracture ) . Patients follow cardiac abnormality : QTcF screen &gt; 450 msec History syncope family history idiopathic sudden death Sustained clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia Risk factor Torsades de Pointes hypokalemia , hypomagnesemia , cardiac failure , clinically significant/symptomatic bradycardia , highgrade AV block Concomitant disease ( ) could prolong QT autonomic neuropathy ( cause diabetes , Parkinson 's disease ) , HIV , cirrhosis , uncontrolled hypothyroidism cardiac failure Concomitant medication ( ) know increase QT interval Diabetic patient antidiabetic medication whose HbA1C &gt; 8 % Patients currently receive high dose systemic steroid treatment MM , patient without prior bortezomib treatment , patient receive investigational agent within 5 half life agent . Patients require therapeutic ( full ) anticoagulation full dose low molecular weight heparin Coumadin goal INR 23 . Patients know brain metastasis ( treat ) exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic AEs . Patients history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition SOM230 LAR and/or bortezomib agent use study . Patients receive immunization attenuate live vaccine study period within 1 week study entry . Patients symptomatic cholelithiasis . Patients previously treat sst sst analogue . Patients second malignancy squamous/basal cell carcinoma skin situ carcinoma cervix unless tumor curatively treat . Known HIV infection Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : Severely impaired lung function Any active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled disorder Nonmalignant medical illness uncontrolled whose control may jeopardize study therapy Women pregnant breast feeding , women/men able conceive unwilling practice medically effective method birth control . Inability comply study and/or followup procedure history medical noncompliance . Patients serious cardiac condition , myocardial infarction within 6 month , unstable angina , sustain ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , clinically significant bradycardia , history syncope , family history idiopathic sudden death , QTc &gt; 450 msec , advanced heart block heart disease define New York Heart Association Class III IV .
