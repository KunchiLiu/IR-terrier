	<brief_summary>Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) relatively common psychiatric condition , classically treat antidepressant medication combination psychotherapy . However , conventional therapeutic approach fail sufficiently improve obsessive-compulsive symptom 20-30 % case . From consideration , deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) , reversible adjustable surgical procedure , recently introduce field resistant OCD . DBS currently use electrode four contact lead , bilaterally implant chosen brain structure . DBS consist delivery high-frequency current quadripolar electrode connect battery power pulse-generating device . Several clinical investigation show DBS , primarily target either ventral striatum ( VS ) subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) , brain site interest particular involvement production OCD symptom , able produce approximately 40 % great reduction clinical symptom intensity severely chronic incapacitating form OCD . These promising finding lead propose comparison efficacy , safety tolerability DBS choose either VS STN brain target conduct large control trial include medico-economic analysis assess classical cost/efficacy ratio .

	<detailed_description>Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) relatively common psychiatric condition estimate lifetime prevalence 2-3 % general population . It generally characterize chronic course lead profound impairment psychosocial functioning mark deterioration quality life . Today , well-established efficacy antidepressant , act preferentially block serotonin reuptake , addition psychological treatment , considerably change poor prognosis illness . However , conventional therapeutic approach fail substantially alleviate obsessive-compulsive symptom 20-30 % case . Deep brain stimulation , reversible adjustable surgical procedure , recently introduce field OCD , primarily target either ventral striatum ( VS ) subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) lead approximately 40 % great reduction clinical symptom intensity baseline level severely chronic resistant form OCD . These promising finding lead propose comparison efficacy , safety tolerability DBS choose either VS STN brain target conduct multicenter , parallel-group , randomize , single-blind trial 13-month follow-up period . For purpose , total population 28 OCD patient meet currently use operational criterion define therapeutic resistance recruit . The surgical procedure consist implantation stimulation electrodes four contact lead , stereotactically bilaterally implant targeted brain structure local anesthesia . Per-operative , single-unit electrophysiological recording neuronal activity perform use five parallel microelectrodes serve guide implantation definitive electrode . They connect battery power pulse-generating device five day later general anesthesia . Thereafter , psychiatric assessment include Y-BOCS ( `` Yale-Brow Obsessive-compulsive scale '' ) PI ( `` Padua Inventory '' ) measure OCD symptom severity , BAS ( `` Brief Anxiety Scale '' ) , MADRS ( `` Montgomery Asberg Depression rating Scale '' ) HAD ( `` Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale '' ) determine anxiety and/or depressive symptom intensity , CGI ( `` Clinical Global Impression '' ) rating scale evaluate global symptom severity treatment response perform every 3 month beyond one-month postoperative free-stimulation period . This coupled large battery neuropsychological test explore executive function combination precise medical record side effect appreciate safety/tolerability DBS . A cost-effectiveness analysis , formal method compare DBS classical therapeutic strategy regard respective resource utilization ( cost ) outcome ( effectiveness ) also carry . Therefore , present study may contribute highlight special interest DBS , effective , safe , well-tolerated cost-relevant surgical approach management resistant OCD .</detailed_description>
