	<brief_summary>The investigator identify possible participant use database previously treat hepatitis c patient . The investigator identify document evidence current inject drug use risk factor acquisition virus . The investigator search receive curative treatment 2004-2010 . This cover patient current database . The investigator include 18 year old . The investigator exclude patient coinfected either hepatitis B HIV . This condition accelerate liver damage combination hepatitis c. The possible participant identify sent information sheet give simple clear outline propose research . The investigator try obtain au date residential address PAS system NHS confirmation patient GP drug worker . It explain purpose study , choose , take part involve , potential advantage disadvantage take part everything keep confidential . It also outline conduct study , expense pay contact detail problems/complaints arise . Those interested take part attend appointment hospital opportunity read information leaflet . They give time ask question study answer fully . They ask sign two copy consent form order take participation . Once complete first 'liver assessment ' . The assessment take approximately 30-45 minute complete . The investigator take three blood sample ( approximately 10mls blood 4 teaspoon full ) . One sample measure level hepatitis C virus blood . This tell u whether reinfection hepatitis C. The second sample measure level inflammation within liver third sample measure full blood count . The investigator perform liver scan call fibroscan . This noninvasive test similar ultrasound ( pregnant woman ) give read tell u 'stiffness ' liver . It take approximately five ten minute complete involve patient lie back right arm head duration scan . Following scan investigator ask participant complete short questionnaire . This include question past current drug use well alcohol use . The answer keep strictly confidential . They store researcher lock office direct participant identifier . They simply study number them.The participant thank time offer Â£30 cover travel time expense visit . They invite attend liver assessment one year first one annually thereafter . This optional course free withdraw study time without need give reason . The investigator identify participant different point time follow curative treatment . For example cure 5 year ago whereas cure 6-12 month ago . This increase number patient year follow . Once investigator do first set liver assessment participant follow prospectively long wish participate . For purpose high degree I present data I follow two year 'liver assessment ' .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reinfection Long Term Outcomes Intravenous Drug Users ( IVDUs ) After Hepatitis C Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There stark paucity data publish concern reinfection rate post successful treatment HCV currently inject drug user . The investigator research focus important area provide desperately need evidence increase confidence treat population carry burden disease . Treating large number individual population reduce incidence HCV inject drug user therefore reduce overall prevalence disease . This reduce current threat public health HCV produce . DETAILS OF MD RESEARCH PROJECT STUDY HYPOTHESIS : HCV therapy currently inject group beneficial reinfection rate long term outcomes comparable current injector . AIMS : 1 . The main aim determine patient successfully treat HCV currently inject drug user comparable rate reinfection inject drug past ( least 6 month ago ) . 2 . A secondary aim determine currently inject drug user comparable long term outcomes inject drug past ( least 6 month prior treatment ) term liver fibrosis progression . OBJECTIVES : 1 . To determine rate reinfection historical cohort drug user HCV previously treat achieve SVR compare inject drug past ( least 6 month prior treatment ) achieve SVR treatment . 2 . To determine long term outcomes inject drug time treatment compare past inject drug user ( injected drug least 6 month prior treatment ) . RESEARCH QUESTIONS : 1 . Do current drug user higher rate reinfection past drug user ? 2 . Is rate reinfection drug user whole low ? 3 . Does progression fibrosis continue follow successful treatment HCV ? 4 . How often currently inject drug user stop inject treatment HCV ? 5 . How often past drug user return inject drug use follow treatment ? 6 . Does rise liver enzyme persist follow successful treatment ? 7 . What commonly use drug injection ? 8 . How often currently inject drug user share needles/equipment ? 9 . Do inject drug user know reinfected follow SVR ? 10 . What proportion inject drug user drink recommended weekly allowance alcohol ? 11 . What quality life post SVR ? METHODOLOGY STUDY DESIGN : This prospective study look reinfection rate base historical cohort intravenous drug user previously treat achieved SVR . PARTICIPANTS : There HCV database set North Manchester Hospital patient start treatment since 2004 . The investigator access create separate database patient inject drug use time risk factor acquisition HCV . The investigator identify inject drug 6 month prior treatment include continued inject treatment . These 'active ' drug use group . The investigator identify group patient stop inject drug least 6 month prior commence treatment . These 'past ' drug use group . CONSENT : The investigator responsible obtain informed consent participant . Two copy consent form obtain - one participant record one study file . Prior obtain informed consent The investigator highlight information come light course study pertain potential criminal activity The investigator oblige pas information relevant authority . DATA COLLECTION : All potential participant send write information detail study invite take part . This avoid possible selection bias . The investigator aim follow group 2 year collect data outcome include reinfection rate use annual HCV RNA ( subsequent genotyping positive ) liver disease progression use standard liver function blood test fibroscan ( non-invasive method ass liver fibrosis cirrhosis ) . A questionnaire regard drug use post treatment do detail high risk practises . They also question drug use treatment order confirm group assign reduce possibility previous underreporting fear exclusion treatment programme initially . Alcohol history also assess . Quality life questionnaire validate use HCV use follow . The investigator aim recruit 45 participant group . The participant ask attend 2 visit total one year apart . One major limitation study frequency sample HCV RNA . By annually investigator may miss reinfections patient clear spontaneously . However , investigator feel persistent viraemia therefore persistent reinfection important quantify . This much physician ' reluctance treat active drug user come perception reinfection occur result need repeat course treatment . Whilst transient reinfections investigator may miss important term onwards transmission , largely result need treatment . DATA HANDLING : All new data gather include specially design database password protect limited access drive NHS computer , follow principle set data protection act . Identifiers keep absolute minimum . Data store 25 year destroy . COMMUNICATION OF RESULTS : The investigator aim distribute communicate result study national international conference . The investigator also aim publish paper peer review journal . The participant inform prior consent entitled access overall result .</detailed_description>
