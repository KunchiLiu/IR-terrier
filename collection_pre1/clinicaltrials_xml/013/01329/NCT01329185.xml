	<brief_title>Treating Kidney Donors With Valganciclovir Reduce Viral Transmission Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The potency new immunosuppressive agent reduce risk body 's immune system reject transplant kidney . However , come price . Kidney transplant recipient face high risk serious infection related malignancy . Viral infection significant cause posttransplant morbidity mortality two herpes viruses great impact : Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) . CMV disease manifest posttransplant fever , leukopenia , mild severe organ involvement ( include pneumonitis , hepatitis , pancreatitis , colitis , meningoencephalitis , rarely myocarditis ) . EBV present posttransplant infectious mononucleosis syndrome , hepatitis , bad case scenario , potentially fatal lymphoproliferative disorder call Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease ( PTLD ) . Moreover , subclinical CMV and/or EBV viremia associate deterioration kidney function kidney transplant recipient . Thus , potential negative impact viruses live transplant recipient profound , unfortunately , complication post-transplant viral infection common occur despite standard antiviral prophylaxis first year posttransplant . These viral infection , instance , originate donor organ virus reside dormant state , counterbalance donor 's healthy immune system . Upon transplantation recipient , whose immune system severely suppress anti-rejection drug , viruses become activated , often lead describe complication . The aim study reduce viral ( CMV EBV ) transmission donor recipient . The discovery anti-retroviral therapy mother HIV reduce transmission virus baby pivotal prevention AIDS along line investigator test hypothesis 14 day anti-viral Valganciclovir ( VAL ) kidney donor prior transplant compare placebo reduce EBV CMV viremia 1st year posttransplant pediatric kidney recipient . We aim enroll 20 donor-recipient pair .</detailed_description>
