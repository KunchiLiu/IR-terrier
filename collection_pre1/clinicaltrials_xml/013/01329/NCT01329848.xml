	<detailed_description>This project study accommodative function , ability focus near work . Visual discomfort symptom , headache , sore eye , blur vision commonly associate prolonged reading near work . Researchers long suspect accommodative dysfunction involve clinical study fail establish relationship weak accommodation symptom read impairment . Recent research , however , find clinical measure overestimate accommodative function encourage use objective , autorefraction method measure study accommodative weakness . This project accomplish three goal . First , use autorefraction objective reliable procedure develop measure accommodative lag , difference target location eye focus . Second , experiment measure real-time impact accommodative lag reading fluency visual discomfort system . Third , study explore role slow adaptive component accommodative weakness . This work lead well method diagnose treat accommodative disorder .</detailed_description>
