	<brief_summary>The objective REACT trial investigate effect roflumilast 500 μg tablet daily versus placebo exacerbation rate pulmonary function COPD patient concomitantly treat fixed combination long-acting β2-agonists ( LABA ) inhale glucocorticosteroids ( ICS ) . In addition , data safety tolerability roflumilast obtain . An additional objective characterize population pharmacokinetic profile roflumilast roflumilast N oxide characterize pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics ( PK/PD ) relationship term efficacy relevant safety aspect . Patients include require severe COPD associate chronic bronchitis history frequent exacerbation must concomitantly treat fix combination LABA ICS . Two parallel treatment arm ( roflumilast 500 μg daily placebo ) include .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The drug test study call Roflumilast . Roflumilast develop treat people chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . This study investigate effect roflumilast 500 μg tablet daily versus placebo exacerbation rate , pulmonary function , major adverse cardiovascular event ( MACE ) COPD patient concomitantly treat fixed combination long-acting beta-agonists ( LABA ) inhale glucocorticosteroids . The study target enroll approximately 1934 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Roflumilast 500 μg daily - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet look like study drug active ingredient Trial treatment take morning mouth breakfast water . The trial consist follow period : - Single-blind baseline period ( 4 week ) patient receive placebo . - Double-blind treatment period ( 52 week ) patient receive either roflumilast match placebo . - Safety follow-up ( 30 day end treatment ( Vend ) premature discontinuation date ) case ongoing Adverse Events Vend , necessary . - Follow-up visit 12 week end treatment , Week 64 ( VFU ) , patient complete trial schedule . This multi-center trial conduct worldwide . The overall time participate study 64 week . Participants make multiple visit clinic include follow-up visit week 64 .</detailed_description>
