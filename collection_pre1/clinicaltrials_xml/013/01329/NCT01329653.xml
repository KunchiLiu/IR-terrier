	<brief_title>Exercise , Age-Related Memory Decline , And Hippocampal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In US , increase length life reduce morbidity mortality result grow number old adult , demographic `` time bomb '' often referred discussion public policy . According Census Bureau , population age 65 double size within next 25 year . Moreover , old adult live healthy life predecessor . While increased length healthy life undeniable societal benefit , bring major societal problem : epidemic aging-related cognitive decline . The need develop intervention address grow problem urgent . Aging-related cognitive dysfunction diffuse ; rather target select brain area , particular frontal lobe hippocampal formation . The separate interconnected subregions hippocampus differentially vulnerable pathogenic mechanism , include normal age process . A range vivo post-mortem study converge dentate gyrus ( DG ) hippocampal subregion differentially target age process . As pathogenic process , intervention improves brain function regional selectivity . One intervention physical exercise , show improve frontal lobe hippocampal function . Using high-resolution variant functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , investigator demonstrate aerobic training selectively benefit DG function human mice . In addition , improvement DG function associate improved performance word list learn task task conventionally think frontal lobe dependent . The human part study significant shortcoming , however : small ( N = 11 ) , lack control group , enrol young subject ( age 20-45 year ) , employ limited neuropsychological test battery . The overall goal proposal use high-resolution variant fMRI test hypothesis aerobic training induce improvement DG function sample younger ( age 20-35 ) old ( 50-65 ) adult , assign randomly active training condition wait list control group . The investigator use comprehensive neuropsychological test examine relationship change DG function select cognitive capacity . Taken together observation normal age differentially target DG , research program establish physical exercise effective approach ameliorate insidious cognitive slide occur age . Thus , potential significance application substantial .</detailed_description>
