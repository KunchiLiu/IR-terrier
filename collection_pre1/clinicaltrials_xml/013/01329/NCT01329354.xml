	<brief_summary>Nowadays , therapy monoclonal antibody consider standard treatment increase rate remission overall survival patient follicular lymphoma . Nevertheless important number patient benefit therapy . A way improve efficiency monoclonal antibody therapy could improve activity effector arm immune system . A strategy propose obtain improvement utilization lymphocyte activate killer ( LAK ) cell . In addition , combination LAK cell monoclonal antibody might obtain additive effect across stimulation antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) activity . The present clinical assay proposes study feasibility , safety effectiveness treatment autologous effector cell expand ex vivo associate standard maintenance treatment rituximab patient follicular lymphoma remission first-line treatment . In addition , plan analyse various biological parameter predict susceptibility patient treatment rituximab . Specifically , propose study polymorphism Fc receptor , polymorphisms related ability complement activation , study complement activity peripheral blood cell subpopulation mediate directly indirectly dependent antibody cytotoxic effect . We also try correlate biological parameter response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There many mechanism involve antitumor effect antibody include induction apoptosis , block angiogenesis , blockade intracellular signaling pathway , activation complement lead lysis tumor cell . However appear antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) one predominant mechanisms action . It important note order obtain powerful ADCC effect necessary action antibody also activity effector cell , thus competence immune system guest . There different cellular subpopulation mediate ADCC effect . CTL NK two subpopulation reduce patient cancer . A way improve efficiency monoclonal antibody would improve activity effector arm immune system . A strategy plan utilization LAK cell . The culture lymphocytes peripheral blood IL-2 activate subpopulation killer cell . This population killer cell activate cytokine ( LAK : lymphokine activate killer ) high number NK CTL cell , increase cytotoxic capacity . It demonstrate immunotherapy LAK cell might effective sure treatment patient follicular lymphoma . In murine model demonstrate LAK cell associate monoclonal antibody increase antitumoral activity compare administration antibody alone . In addition , model combination also superior administration monoclonal antibody + IL-2 ( Schultz et al. , 1990 ) . Other investigator demonstrate similar result . This information support idea combine therapy consist LAK anti-CD20 antibody . This therapy induce destruction CD20 positive cell great monoclonal antibody alone . In addition , report administration systemic IL-2 LAK cell improve ADCC lymphoma patient treat rituximab . It small pilot study , 10 patient . Seven receive LAK cell follow programmed way . The safety treatment promise result demonstrate study encourage investigate line . Since one mechanism action monoclonal antibody promote ADCC , hypothesis treatment suspension autologous effector lymphocyte expand ex-vivo culture modify biological effect treatment rituximab follicular lymphoma patient , acceptable safety profile , probably increase efficiency monoclonal antibody . In order evaluate hypotesis propose open , prospective , historically control , phase II clinical study patient follicular lymphoma achieve remission first-line therapy include anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
