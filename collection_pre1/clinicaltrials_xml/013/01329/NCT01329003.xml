	<brief_summary>Silicosis well-known occupational disease cause free crystalline silica ( silicon dioxide ) mark inflammation pulmonary fibrosis . There cumulative evidence exposure Caesar stone ( quartz surface product manufacture 93 % quartz , polymer resin pigment ) particularly dangerous exposed worker . Goals : To examine correlation disease exposure Caesar stone genetic difference regard gene involve oxidative stress understand Genetic susceptibility</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DNA-damage Pathways Workers Exposed Silica ( Caesar Stone )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It sub-study `` DNA-damage biomarkers monitor early detect health impairment worker expose Silica ( Caesar Stone ) '' study . Study participant would recruit two year study . They ask come single visit Pulmonary Laboratory Tel Aviv Medical Center . During meeting , participant give precise explanation test perform sign inform consent perform follow test : 1 . Induced sputum ( IS ) 2 . Exhaled Breath Condensate 3 . Pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) 4 . Participants ask complete occupational questionnaire Genetic study ( DNA ) do peripheral blood sample ( 20 ml ) study difference Heme oxygenase 1 ( HO-1 ) gene sequence participant evidence clinically definite silicosis accord American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society ( ATS/ERS ) guideline participant without evidence clinically definite silicosis.DNA sample obtain cod day participant visit collect reasonable amount sample examination gene interest done.Analysis data do completion data collection laboratory test . Each sample give specific code protect confidentiality participant . Blood sample , test result code key kept different place research staff accessibility genetic information . In case employer person include research staff accessibility information . In study genetic analysis connect gender , nationality social feature .</detailed_description>
