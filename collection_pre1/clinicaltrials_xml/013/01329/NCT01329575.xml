	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer-related death United States 5-year survival rate 15,7 % .1 In lung cancer malignancy , esophageal cancer , accurate stag essential establish prognosis patient management . Staging help determine surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , combination , palliative approach adequate.2,3 Assessment lymph node ( LNs ) invasion metastasis undertaken patient management influence positive negative result . In non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , mediastinal LN invasion malignant cell critical factor determine patient consider surgical candidate not.2 In esophageal cancer , LN metastasis may find mediastinum , neck abdomen.4 Invasion LNs must consider selection treatment esophageal cancer.3,4 There single method investigate mediastinal LN invasion . Hence , patient may undergo several test procedure . Noninvasive invasive approach employ . Within invasive technique , endoscopic ultrasonography needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) endobronchial ultrasonography transbronchial needle aspiration ( EBUS-TBNA ) gain importance mediastinal staging.5 They provide ultrasonographic image permit needle aspiration direct vision cytology specimen analysis . As evidence accumulate stag approach , number cervical mediastinoscopies , consider gold-standard mediastinal staging , diminishing.6 Characteristics benign malignant LNs use ultrasonography describe various context . Cervical axillary LNs provide accurate characteristic ( eg . shape , short- long-axis ratio , number blood vessel LN , vascularization pattern , etc . ) predict malignancy linear superficial transducers.7-11 LN characteristic use EUS EBUS also establish criterion predict mediastinal LN malignancy ( eg . size , shape , border echogenicity ) .12 Depending study , suggest obtain specimen accessible LNs without consider characteristic . It also suggest proceed selective LN aspiration base LN characteristic , advantage cost reduction ( few needle use , less time carry procedure , specimens need analyse ) .6 Color Doppler LN characteristic endoluminal ultrasound ( US ) mention small number study need investigated.13,14 With good result obtain superficial US , seem reasonable believe color Doppler characteristic would increase accuracy detect malignancy mediastinal LNs endoluminal US . New processor probe accurate one use past study . Hence , investigator possibly obtain precise finding one investigator find literature.14 This study consist prospective assessment LN characteristic patient undergo EUS-FNA and/or EBUS-TBNA diagnostic purpose . Cytology result consider gold-standard . By compare LN characteristic cytology result , investigator establish score system accurately predict malignancy . The impact study significant . If clinician accurately predict malignancy mediastinal lymph node use ultrasound characteristic , biopsy lymph node could avoid would decrease risk patient cost system ( disposable needle cost , cytological preparation analysis ) . Hypotheses : With combination endoluminal ultrasound characteristic , simple scoring system establish help predict malignancy mediastinal lymph node . Objectives : 1 . Establish score system accurately predict mediastinal lymph node malignancy endoluminal ultrasound . 2 . Retrospectively evaluate impact establish score system number lymph node aspiration require accurate staging . Study Design : Prospective , cohort study design . Clinical trial : Intervention - endoluminal ultrasound . Methods : This study consist prospective non-randomized evaluation endoluminal ultrasound characteristic mediastinal lymph node use endoluminal ultrasound predict malignancy within node . All patient undergo EUS-FNA and/or EBUS-TBNA mediastinal LN staging suspect confirmed malignancy CHUM - HÃ´pital Notre-Dame approach attempt enroll study . Patients enrol consented study pre-operative evaluation pre-operative clinic . The investigator aim recruit 100 consecutive patient . Consented patient undergo EUS without FNA and/or EBUS without TBNA way plan decided procedure surgeon . During procedure , data collect , include lymph node size , shape , border , echogenicity , homogeneity , location , color Doppler characteristic , number node , etc . This add additional step time procedure . All data cytology result obtain EUS-FNA EBUS-TBNA enter prospective database . The cytology result consider gold-standard collected characteristic univariate multivariate logistic regression use establish score system predict malignancy . Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value accuracy determine base developed model .</detailed_description>
