	<brief_title>Risk Narcolepsy Associated With Administration H1N1 Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study aim describe epidemiological clinical characteristic case narcolepsy occur Quebec period 1 January 2009 December 31 , 2010 ass risk develop narcolepsy associate vaccine influenza A/H1N1 . The study last six month . Based prevalence narcolepsy , estimate 100 people develop symptom narcolepsy January 1st , 2009 December 31 , 2010 participate study sleep clinic Sacré-Coeur Hospital Montreal . Narcolepsy primarily characterize presence excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) cataplexy . EDS occur daily usually disable symptom narcolepsy . Cataplexy consist sudden drop muscle tone trigger strong sudden emotion laughter , anger surprise . Cataplexy specific symptom narcolepsy present every patient especially disease onset . Two auxiliary symptom sleep paralysis hypnagogic hallucination either sleep onset upon awaken night morning . They present approximately two third narcoleptic patient especially young individual early stage narcolepsy . Narcolepsy associate absence low level hypocretin1 peptide cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . Narcolepsy cataplexy diagnose purely clinical ground diagnosis whenever possible confirm night-time polysomnography ( PSG ) follow daytime multiple sleep latency test ( MSLT ) . Sleep latency MSLT inferior equal 8 minute presence two sleep onset REM period ( SOREMPs ) . Human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) type patient narcolepsy-cataplexy almost always show presence HLA DQB1*0602 . Finally , measure CSF level hypocretin-1 specific sensitive diagnosis narcolepsy cataplexy . Cases narcolepsy follow administration A/H1N1 pandemic vaccine report Sweden , Finland , France Canada . The majority report show temporal association inactivate ( AS03 ) adjuvanted A/H1N1 vaccine . These case common feature : severe sleepiness presence cataplexy , abrupt onset rapid evolution , presence HLA DBQ1*0602 marker , low CSF hypocretin-1 , positive MSLT test . At request European Medicines Agency ( EMA ) , series investigation consider GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals , include one Quebec . In province , follow report four case narcolepsy cataplexy potentially associate administration Arepanrix , research team contact federal provincial public health authority evaluate possibility independent investigation . A retrospective cohort study propose . The existence comprehensive influenza immunization registry Quebec allow precise identification cohort expose subject , age gender . Exposed subject follow time vaccine administration ( first dose inactivate AS03 A/H1N1 pandemic vaccine ) record immunization registry . The size non-exposed subject gender- age-specific category estimate number census data ( accurate source provincial health insurance data ) minus number influenza immunization registry . Pseudo-dates vaccine administration generate non-exposed subject base distribution date vaccinate subject . Non-exposed subject follow pseudo-date vaccine administration . All neurologist , pulmonologists , neuro-pediatricians child psychiatrist practice province Quebec contact asked report confirm suspected case narcolepsy onset period January1st , 2009 December 31 , 2010 . Patients contact physician invite call sleep center participate study newly diagnose case narcolepsy . They undergo brief screen telephone questionnaire . At point , meet minimum criterion narcolepsy , ask agree participate study . The study include , first , sign consent form complete questionnaire . The questionnaire include question demographic , medical history , medication , detailed question symptom narcolepsy . In child , information base parental response . A physician specialize sleep medicine call participant review questionnaire propose series test sleep laboratory 'Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal ' , include nocturnal polysomnography , MSLT test , blood sampling ( HLA type ) , lumbar puncture ( hypocretin measurement ) . Patients sign second consent form site 'Hôpital du Sacré-Coeur de Montréal ' agree participate second portion study . Monitoring subject study do supervision Dr. Jacques Montplaisir , MD , PhD .</detailed_description>
