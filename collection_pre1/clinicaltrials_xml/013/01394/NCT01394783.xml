	<brief_summary>Every year thousand neonates born North America need extensive resuscitation often include endotracheal intubation ( ETI ) . In situation , Pediatricians assume role Neonatal Resuscitation Program ( NRP ) providers responsible ETI procedure . They acquire skill residency train Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) delivery room . Difficulties perform neonatal ETI lie small size mouth airway neonate , particular anatomy larynx . This limited visibility represent challenge even experienced clinician . Recently , new videolaryngoscope ( VL ) technique introduce adult pediatric medical field describe respectively Kaplan et al . Weiss et al . In 2009 , Vanderhal et al . report preliminary experience newborn population . Video assist intubation could method choice teach neonatal ETI . To best knowledge , human study compare VL classic laryngoscope ( CL ) acquire skill neonatal ETI NICU . This study aim : 1 . To assess videolaryngoscope superior classic laryngoscope acquire neonatal endotracheal intubation skill Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ; 2 . To assess skill acquire videolaryngoscope experience transferable use classic laryngoscope show persistent difference success rate favor videolaryngoscope group . The hypothesis 1 . Primary hypothesis : In Neonatal Intensive Care Unit , use videolaryngoscope increase success rate endotracheal intubation 20 % compare classic laryngoscope . Later , acquire experience videolaryngoscope transferable use classic laryngoscope show persistent difference success rate 20 % favor videolaryngoscope group . 2 . Secondary hypothesis We expect videolaryngoscope decrease time intubation , decrease rate esophageal right bronchial main stem intubation . It also improve teach endotracheal intubation pediatric resident help supervisor recognize problem relate intubation improve resident ' level confidence perform skill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Videolaryngoscope v Classic Laryngoscope Teaching Neonatal Endotracheal Intubation : Randomized Controlled Trial .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology Consent study The principal investigator approach pediatric resident participate study . Parents child approach principal investigator clinical research coordinator either antenatal admission NICU case eventual need infant ETI . If consent make antenatally , insure do different physician one perform antenatal consultation . Training ETI In centre , resident learn neonatal ETI simulation centre CHU Ste-Justine first year resident teach NRP end June every year , one week start residency training . The procedure explain demonstrate mannequin ( Laerdal Neonatal Intubation Trainer ) use CL neonatologist resident practice mannequin couple time ( 3-5 ) . Further train do clinical set real patient opportunistic manner . In situation , supervise neonatologist senior subspecialty resident guide , coach give constructive feedback . Residents consent study train use VL randomization . This teach session do similarly one described . The procedure explain demonstrate mannequin ( Laerdal Neonatal Intubation Trainer ) principal investigator use VL resident offer practice handle VL practice ETI mannequin couple time ( 3-5 ) . They supervise principal investigator guide , coach give constructive feedback . This process insure resident depart level comfort ( discomfort ) CL . ETI procedure In unit , two three resident service time . When patient need intubate priority go resident charge patient . In case physician charge neonatologist , subspecialty resident nurse practitioner draw do decide resident proceed ETI . The pediatric resident first person attempt ETI allow three attempt . If fails , subspecialty resident , respiratory therapist neonatologist proceed ETI . In case urgent ETI ( respiratory cardiovascular instability , resuscitation , cardiovascular arrest , etc . ) complication attempt resident , senior physician ( subspecialty resident neonatologist ) proceed ETI . At ETI procedure , resident , neonatologist subspecialty resident , nurse respiratory therapist . For study , second respiratory therapist ass primary secondary outcome ( use stopwatch ) collect necessary data . About six respiratory therapist train role , two per 8 hour shift . Monitoring child do use non invasive arterial blood pressure , electrocardiogram pulse oximeter . The device use study CL use Miller blade ( size 0 1 ) , C-MAC VL ( blade size 0 1 ) develop Karl Storz Endoscopy . The VL use proceed ETI indirectly use video monitor guidance . Premedication ETI consist bolus atropine 20 mcg/kg IV , fentanyl 2-5 mcg/kg dilute 1 cc total normal saline give IV 3 5 minute , follow bolus 2 mg/kg IV succinylcholine . Facemask ventilation preoxygenation do every attempt . After ETI , confirmation do auscultation carbon dioxide detector , chest x-ray performed assess position tip endotracheal tube . Definitions 1 . Intubation success endotracheal tube place trachea vocal cord It define accord usual clinical norm : change color carbon dioxide detector , vapor endotracheal tube , thoracic expansion , assessment bilateral lung air entry , absence air entry stomach auscultation , improvement patient 's clinical parameter : heart rate arterial oxygen saturation . 2 . Time intubation define time insertion laryngoscope blade patient ' mouth pull . 3 . Esophageal intubation diagnose absence clinical sign successful endotracheal intubation possibly air entry stomach auscultation . 4 . Right bronchial main stem intubation diagnose chest x-ray . 5 . A trial count attempt insertion laryngoscope blade patient 's mouth . Data collection intubation . 1 . Patient : gestational age birth , birth weight , sex infant , post natal age , current weight , require inspired fraction oxygen , number ventilate day number previous intubation . 2 . Intubator : training level , past training experience pediatrics neonatology , number complete rotation neonatology , number neonatal intubation try , succeed fail past . 3 . Intubation : date ( later categorize weekday week-end ) , time ( later categorize day ( 8h-17h ) , even ( 17h-00h ) night ( 00h-8h ) ) , indication intubation , semi urgent elective intubation , number attempt , length attempt , intubator attempt , final position tip endotracheal tube ( include right bronchial main stem intubation ) , reason fail intubation ( include esophageal intubation ) , naso orotracheal intubation , premedication use include dos supervisor . 4 . A survey distribute resident supervisor ETI event . The survey ass resident ' level confidence attempt ETI ask supervisor level easiness recognize problem laryngoscopy , endotracheal tube insertion placement . Randomization procedure After consent , randomization do distribute sealed envelope stratify accord year residency training . Residents initially randomize intubate either videolaryngoscope ( experimental group ) classical laryngoscope ( control group ) . In second phase , student use CL ETI . Each resident expect perform least five maximum ten ETI per method . When resident reach ten ETI VL , change CL method . We plan obtain 100 ETI four group total 400 ETI . Methods data analysis sample size estimate Using CL , resident centre obtain success rate ETI 55 % ( unpublished data ) . Assuming increase 20 % success rate 75 % experimental group ( VL ) , Î± level 0.05 statistical power 80 % , need 89 ETI per group . In second phase , show 20 % high success rate experimental group ( 75 % ) control group ( 55 % ) statistical condition , need 89 ETI per group total 356 ETI . In study , plan obtain 100 ETI per group total 400 ETI . In centre approximately 500 ETI year . Of , 20 % ( 100 ) do delivery room another 20 % ( 100 ) do subspecialty resident , neonatologist respiratory therapist urgency difficulty intubation . Considering rate patient recruitment 60-75 % , study complete 2 year .</detailed_description>
