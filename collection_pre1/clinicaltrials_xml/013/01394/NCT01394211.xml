	<brief_title>Neo-adjuvant Therapy With Anastrozole Plus Pazopanib Stage II III ER+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pathologic complete response ( pCR ) rate surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate alternative measurement anti-tumor activity : proportion patient achieve sustained decrease antigen KI-67 ( ki-67 ) 12 week therapy anastrozole plus pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) ; proportion patient achieve down-staging pathologic stage 0 1 surgery . II . To assess qualitative quantitative toxicity combination , special emphasis frequency event grade 3 great , occurrence unexpected toxicity . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride* orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) anastrozole PO QD 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo definitive surgery . NOTE : *Pazopanib hydrochloride stop 7-14 day surgery .</detailed_description>
