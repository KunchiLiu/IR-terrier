	<brief_title>Impact Food Additives Phosphorus Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phosphorus mineral find food dairy product , nut , meat , important strengthen bone . However , much phosphorus blood may bad health heart blood vessel . The kidney keep blood level phosphorus normal get rid extra phosphorus urine . New research find common form food additive high phosphorus may increase blood phosphorus level individual kidney disease . In addition , food additive may increase blood level hormone control phosphorus parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) fibroblast growth factor 23 ( FGF23 ) . Like high blood phosphorus level , high level PTH FGF23 blood may also bad health heart blood vessel . In study , investigator would like examine effect food additive blood level phosphorus , PTH FGF23 individual normal kidney function .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy volunteer , 19 45 year age abnormal urinalysis—presence hematuria , proteinuria , leukocyturia . pregnancy breastfeed Medical condition impact phosphate metabolism—primary hyperparathyroidism ; gastrointestinal malabsorption disorder Crohn 's Disease , ulcerative colitis , celiac disease , liver dysfunction ; hyper hypothyroidism ; irregular menses female subject . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) ≥ 30 g/m2 since obesity independently associate impaired phosphorus metabolism . Medications know affect phosphorus metabolism— current use phosphorus supplement , highdose activate vitamin D compound , regular antacid laxative use , anticonvulsant . Hyper hypophosphatemia ( ≥ 4.6 mg/dl ≤ 2.5 mg/dl respectively ) , hyper hypocalcemia ( ≥ 10.6 ≤ 8.5 mg/dl respectively ) , severe anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 8 g/dl woman &lt; 9 g/dl men ) .</criteria>
