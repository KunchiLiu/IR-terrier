	<brief_summary>Alterations functional brain network frequently demonstrate schizophrenia , although exact underlying molecular mechanism remain unrevealed . Ketamine know exert schizophrenia-like effect modulation glutamatergic system , thus facilitate investigation impact specific transmitter system rest state functional brain network . The aim study therefore use pharmacological functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( phMRI ) examine change brain network involve schizophrenia response ketamine application compare placebo . 30 healthy subject ( 15 female ) examine twice use double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , crossover , counterbalanced-order design . Resting state fMRI investigate , either placebo ketamine intravenous infusion 20 minute . Prior main trial 10 additional participant include open pilot trial . Hypothesis : Ketamine application induce change rest state network previously associate schizophrenia connectivity relevant brain region striatum , thalamus , caudate , hippocampus amygdala . Furthermore , application ketamine provoke change BOLD-activation three fMRI paradigm perform ketamine infusion .</brief_summary>
