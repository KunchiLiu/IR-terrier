	<detailed_description>AIMS OF THE PROJECT : The aim project map effect thromboprophylactic dose LMWH coagulation woman end pregnancy , use recently available method laboratory test , simultaneously evaluate possible influence LMWH incidence spinal hematoma . The methodology base primarily complex examination coagulation thrombelastography ( TEG ) , include comparative test heparinase , monitor effect LMWH measure thrombin generation time ( TGT ) level AntiXa . At time , cooperation Thrombotic Centre , standard special laboratory hematology test perform ( INR , APTT , TT , fibrinogen , AT III , D-dimer , protein S , protein C , APC resistance , PFA , F VII , F VIII , PFA 100 , TAT micro , vWf , APA , t-PA , PAI-1 , blood count ) together genetic test FV Leiden prothrombin II mutation . HYPOTHESIS AND EXPECTED RESULTS : We assume hypercoagulation influence factor pregnancy , effect LMWH coagulation , compare population non-pregnant woman , significantly low . Thus significantly low also effect TED prophylaxis . For reason assume current thromboprophylactic dosage LMWH could affect coagulation pregnant woman enough increase risk spinal hematoma neuraxial analgesia/anaesthesia administration . SPECIFIC AIMS : Primary aim : To map coagulation effect standard prophylactic dose LMWH pregnant woman end pregnancy . Based result , evaluate possible prophylactic effect LMWH TED prevention pregnant compare non-pregnant woman evaluate possible influence LMWH potential risk spinal hematoma development neuraxial blockade pregnancy . Secondary aim : To propose change thromboprophylactic regimen pregnancy . To suggest change recommended time interval LMWH application administration neuraxial blockade pregnant woman . METHODS AND RESEARCH SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS : Study design : prospective , monitor Size type study group : total 50 pregnant woman physiological ongoing pregnancy undergo plan caesarean section , without know coagulation disorder , include study Inclusion criterion : pregnant woman undergo planned caesarean section , 39th-40th week pregnancy , age 18-40 year , inform consent . Exclusion criterion : disapproval non-cooperation mother , allergy LMWH , coagulation disorder risk , anticoagulant therapy last 3 month , sign infection , history cancer , sign thrombosis history thrombosis , ongoing non-physiological pregnancy , significant obesity , severe comorbidity . Withdrawal criterion : development obstetric complication mother foetus study follow , find prothrombotic state . Control group : 50 healthy woman fertility age ( 18-40 year ) undergo elective surgery oncology inflammatory indication , without know risk factor coagulation disorder , use hormonal contraception , informed consent . LMWH application : standard thromboprophylactic dose LMWH ( 4000 IU enoxaparin subcutaneously ) give pregnant woman/patient control group . Monitoring coagulation : To evaluate coagulation change administration LMWH dose perform thrombelastographic examination ( TEG ; Haemascope Corp. , USA . ) venous blood ( include examination heparinase ) specific laboratory test measure effect LMWH activity - antiXa TGT ( thrombin generation time ) . Coagulation system also examine available laboratory test ( INR , APTT , TT , fibrinogen , AT III , D-dimer , protein S , protein C , APC resistance , PFA , F VII , F VIII , PFA 100 , TAT micro , vWf , APA , t-PA , PAI-1 , blood count ) include genetic testing FV Leiden prothrombin II mutation . Monitoring coagulation take place four phase : 1 . Basal level - LMWH application 2 . The maximum effect LMWH - 4 hour application 3 . Low efficiency LMWH - 8 hour application 4 . Control level LMWH effectiveness - 24 hour application Samplings laboratory test perform way sample TEG examination - venous blood plan time take one-time blood draw prevent premature coagulation activation dilution sample . Blood sample collect accord standard guideline ( coagulation test TEG test tube sodium citrate ) - subsequently process Central haematology laboratory . For TEG examination 1 ml whole blood activate 1 % celite 360 μl sample ( 340 μl blood + 20 μl CaCl2 ) analyze standard cuvette 360 μl sample ( 340 μl blood + 20 μl CaCl2 ) cuvette heparinase . Following parameter record : time r , time K , angle alpha , maximum amplitude MA LY30 factor fibrinolysis . From measure value coagulation index ( CI ) calculate . DATA COLLECTION : Demographic , obstetric clinical data - age , height , weight , BMI , gestational age , previous pregnancy , associate medical condition . Standard pre-operative assessment pharmacological history . Fluid intake output surveillance . Any bleed / thromboembolic complication begin study end hospitalization Cesarean section . DATA PROCESSING : All data store electronic database safety back . Statistical analysis perform cooperation Biomedical Statistics Dept . Institute Biophysics Informatics , Charles University Prague , 1st Faculty Medicine . Based preliminary analysis overall number subject determine 50 study group . DATA EVALUATION : Based study result relationship potential risk spinal hematoma LMWH application evaluate Expert Committee Obstetric Anaesthesia Czech Society Anaesthesiology Intensive Care Medicine ( ČCSARIM ) . The conclusion result recommendation submit Executive Committee ČSARIM . TIME SCHEDULE : Based feasibility test pilot study consider real inclusion 3 patient study per month . This number base number anticipate elective caesarean operation possibility recruit appropriate subject satisfy criterion , also organizational difficulty sample study hour 8 24 take place subject 's residence . 1. st year - create study database , patient recruitment , inclusion 15 pregnant woman + 15 control ; sample process . 2. nd year - recruiting patient , inclusion 25 pregnant woman + 15 control , process analysis sample , evaluation presentation preliminary study data . 3. rd year - recruiting patient , inclusion 10 pregnant woman + 20 control , process analysis sample . The evaluation study data , statistical evaluation , presentation publication final result . DEPARTMENTS INVOLVED , PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR´S READINESS : Department Anaesthesiology Intensive Care Institute Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory Diagnostics , Central Hematology Laboratory , Thrombotic Centre Department Gynaecology Obstetrics EXPECTED RESULTS AND PROJECT IMPORTANCE : The expected project outcome detailed evaluation influence LMWH coagulation pregnant woman suggest modification dose scheme thromboprophylaxis Caesarean operation , would better reflect physiological hypercoagulation pregnancy . Due improve TED prophylaxis main long-term outcome reduction maternal mortality connection thromboembolic disease . At time want prove current dosage LMWH pregnant woman increase risk epidural hematoma neuraxial blockade would recommend change time relationship administration LMWH neuraxial blockade . COOPERATION ON THE PROJECT : The project perform cooperation Dept . Anaesthesiology Intensive Care , Thrombotic Centre Institute Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory Diagnostics Dept . Gynaecology Obstetrics . The relationship risk spinal hematoma LMWH application evaluate Expert Committee Obstetric Anaesthesia Executive Committee Czech Society Anaesthesiology Intensive Care Medicine . DISCUSSION : So far , study publish deal influence thromboprophylactic LMWH dose coagulation pregnant woman . The study , show reduced effect LMWH pregnancy , evaluate effect antiXa activity . Our project differ complexity range available method use thrombin generation time especially thrombelastography . Thus project also build result previous grant project IGA No . NR8157 `` The use thrombelastography evaluate coagulation woman physiologically pathologically ongoing pregnancy , birth beyond '' . EXPECTED PROJECT BENEFITS AND IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED PROJECT The project aim clarify effect LMWH coagulation pregnant woman birth , period maximal physiological hypercoagulable state high risk thromboembolism , common cause maternal mortality develop country . Although LMWH routinely administer prevention thromboembolism woman undergo Caesarean operation , effect coagulation pregnant woman yet study . Research haemocoagulation pregnant woman worldwide rather difficult , result project highly await great opportunity present Czech research European World forum . The main expected benefit project evaluation adequacy current LMWH thromboprophylaxis pregnant woman ( recently derive surgical patient ) . The next important study outcome evaluation possible influence LMWH thromboprophylaxis risk spinal hematoma connection neuraxial anaesthesiology technique pregnant woman . In situation target outcome change present recommendation increase safety pregnant woman undergo Caesarean operation . Just Czechia issue affect 30 000 women/year .</detailed_description>
