	<brief_title>Analgesic Efficacy Repeated Doses Intravenous ( IV ) Acetaminophen Post-operative Pediatric Spine Fusion Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An ideal drug opiate-sparing analgesic adjunct , acetaminophen , unlike drug , platelet function sparing , thus particularly useful post-operative orthopedic patient population . In part well establish safety profile , well minimal drug interaction , acetaminophen consider cornerstone multimodal analgesic approach . Several study describe clinically significant beneficial effect multimodal drug approach analgesia , cite improve pain control short recovery time . Reduced adverse event improve pain control multimodal analgesia drug approach may result short hospitalization , improve recovery function , reduce health care cost . Opiate therapy , effective analgesia , associate variety potential adverse side effect , include pruritus , nausea , emesis , ileus , respiratory depression , tolerance , addiction sedation . These adverse effect may limit post-operative mobility , postpone return bowel function , cause feeding intolerance , prolong hospitalization , postpone post-operative recovery . While oral acetaminophen useful opiate-sparing therapy , oral route drug administration may feasible early post-operative period . Enteral drug absorption initial post-operative period may erratic , negative impact therapeutic effect . Intravenous acetaminophen may particularly useful analgesic circumstance . At present , pediatric study United States examine efficacy multiple- dose IV acetaminophen post-operative surgical population . This study compare analgesic efficacy , nausea pruritus score , time recovery , length hospital stay two subject group status post spine fusion surgery : receive schedule IV acetaminophen opiate 48 hour , treat standard opiate therapy without IV acetaminophen .</detailed_description>
