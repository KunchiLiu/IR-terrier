	<detailed_description>This trial open-label , randomize , parallel treatment , active-control multicenter study adult male document metastatic prostate cancer disease judge candidate hormone therapy . Within 21 day prior implant insertion , prospective enrollee enter screening period provide medical history , demographic information , physical examination , laboratory evaluation , 12-lead ECG , bone scan , chest x-ray , liver ultrasound , concomitant medication procedure , physician assessment include pain level WHO performance scale order ass eligibility study . Written inform consent obtain procedure undertaken . Once inclusion/exclusion criterion meet , baseline evaluation ( physical assessment examination , vital sign weight , clinical laboratory evaluation , concomitant medication procedure , adverse event , Quality Life questionnaire ) obtain prior implant insertion Day 1 [ Visit 1 ] . All appropriately screen patient receive either histrelin acetate 50-mg Zoladex 3-Month 10.8 mg implant base 1:1 randomization Day 1 [ Visit 1 ] . Patients implant evaluate Week 1 2 [ Visits 2 3 ] post-insertion testosterone PSA concentration , vital sign , adverse event , concomitant medication procedure . The Zoladex implant replace Weeks 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 [ Visits 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 ] , histrelin acetate implant replace Week 52 ( Visit 16 ) , respectively . Patients follow monthly Weeks 4 60 [ Visits 4 18 ] evaluate testosterone PSA concentration , adverse event , concomitant medication procedure , disease progression , urine serum histrelin renal/hepatic impairment subgroup . Periodic clinical subjective assessment complete patient .</detailed_description>
