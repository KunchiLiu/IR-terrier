	<brief_title>A Novel Method Non-invasive Ventilation Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Airway management pediatric population differs adult population difference respiratory physiology anatomy . For example oxygen consumption three time higher child compare adult ; therefore , problem ventilate child high impact oxygen delivery oxygen reserve . Current guideline recommend respiratory emergency one `` ventilate intubate '' cricothyroidectomy ( insertion needle cricothyroid membrane neck ) perform . This procedure invasive difficult perform , especially small child . Since time simplicity essential successful airway management hypothesize investigator could utilize physiological principle behind breathe ventilate child use release applied pressure chest . During , inspiration , vertical transverse dimension thorax increase , generate negative pressure intrapleural space chest wall , allow air draw lung . As child compliant rib cage one theoretical way improve lung inflation apply external pressure chest . The intrathoracic pressure increase atmospheric pressure air preferentially flow lung accord pressure gradient . When pressure release chest recoil passively , negative intrathoracic pressure generate , allow air flow lung accord pressure gradient create . If sufficient tidal volume generate release pressure chest could potentially become simple , non-invasive , life-saving technique child difficult airway . By adapt principle describe , possible tidal volume therefore , gas exchange take place release pressure apply chest .</detailed_description>
