	<brief_title>A Safety Study Epoetin Alfa Patients With Cancer Who Have Chemotherapy-Related Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epoetin alfa agent similar hormone produce kidney ( ie , erythropoietin ) function increase amount red blood cell make bone marrow . This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , open-label ( patient doctor know identity study drug administer ) , safety study 2 dosing regimen ( dos schedule ) epoetin alfa administered patient cancer chemotherapy-related anemia . Anemia lack red blood cell result symptom weakness , shortness breath , fatigue , tiredness , decrease activity . The primary outcome measure study number patient treatment group least 1 clinically relevant objectively confirm ( adjudicate ) thrombovascular event ( TVE ) review independent adjudication committee Day 1 ( baseline day first dose ) Week 16 . An external review relevant clinical data medical imaging study Adjudication Committee perform blinded fashion confirmation TVEs . The Adjudication Committee confirm TVEs review image ( X-ray , Computed tomography [ CT ] scan , ultrasound , Magnetic Resonance Imaging [ MRI ] scan , etc ) diagnostic procedure auch coagulation test electrocardiograms combination clinical patient profile describe specific type TVE . Only TVEs determine Adjudication Committee clinically relevant objectively confirm count analysis primary endpoint . Approximately 500 patient , cancer , receive chemotherapy , anemic , take part study . Patients participate study 32 week ( include 2-week screening period determine eligibility study , 26-week treatment period , 4-week follow-up period end-of-study assessment [ test ] perform ) . The length participation study depend length time patient receive chemotherapy epoetin alfa ; patient study may receive maximum 26 week treatment epoetin alfa . Patients randomly assign ( assigned chance like flip coin ) 1 2 treatment group ( Epoetin Alfa QW Epoetin Alfa TIW ) . Patients assign Epoetin Alfa QW Group receive epoetin alfa initial dosage 450 IU/kg week patient assign Epoetin Alfa TIW Group receive epoetin alfa 150 IU/kg 3 time week subcutaneous ( underneath skin ) injection . Injections give preferably Monday patient Epoetin Alfa QW Group Mondays , Wednesdays , Fridays patient Epoetin Alfa TIW Group . During study , patient visit study center weekly blood sample collect measure amount hemoglobin ( red blood cell ) blood . Depending hemoglobin level , dose epoetin alfa may increase decrease . Regardless treatment group , anemia improve patient 4 week treatment , dose epoetin alfa increase 300 IU/kg 3 time week . If anemia improve 4 week increase dose level epoetin alfa ( 300 IU/kg 3 time week ) , treatment epoetin alfa stop . In addition , study , patient may also receive treatment iron supplement level iron blood low . During study , safety monitor evaluate adverse event finding clinical laboratory test , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , blood pressure measurement , physical examination . Patients receive epoetin alfa initial dose 450 IU/kg week 150 IU/kg 3 time week subcutaneous injection , preferably abdomen , 4 week last dose chemotherapy maximum 26 week . Injections Epoetin Alfa QW Group study center Epoetin TIW Group , 1st weekly injection study center 2nd 3rd weekly injection study center home self-administration .</detailed_description>
