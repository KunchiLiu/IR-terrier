	<brief_summary>Bronchiolitis obliterable syndrome ( BOS ) common cause death long-term survivor lung transplantation refractory intervention . Many risk factor BOS identify previous study acute cellular rejection , lymphocytic bronchiolitis , cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) non-CMV respiratory infection , injury allograft airway , Primary graft dysfunction , HLA mismatching , organize pneumonia . ( Belperio JA . et al. ) . Neutrophils release product may involve development BOS . Neutrophilia repeatedly observe bronchoalveolar lavage fluid patient lung transplantation . In addition , infiltration neutrophil bronchial epithelium detect patient higher degree active airway damage . Neutrophils capable causing severe damage lung tissue release toxic protease reactive oxygen specie counterbalance antiprotease/ antioxidant screen lung . Based background , causal relationship neutrophilia development BOS propose . ( Hirsch J. et al . ) Detection unopposed Neutrophile elastase ( NE ) activity BAL appear correlate poor outcome due refractory BOS . Unopposed NE subject may serve marker evolve graft dysfunction also participate damaging airway allograft inhibit adequate bacterial clearance . Prevention neutrophil sequestration inhibition NE may prevent attenuate airway damage improve bacterial clearance mechanism . ( Nutley D et al . ) These data demonstrate importance neutrophil unopposed NE pathogenesis BOS call new approach prevent modulate BOS target mechanism . AAT main inhibitor neutrophil elastase lower airways patient AAT deficiency low concentration protein region lung . This explain proteinase/antiproteinase theory development emphysema deficient patient amount elastase release lung exceed amount AAT . The net result persistence elastase activity lead lung destruction pathological change emphysema . ( Abusriwil H. et al . ) The administration AAT address proteinase/antiproteinase imbalance . Administration AAT help prevent destruction lung architecture reduce inflammatory dysregulation cause pulmonary dysfunction . It expect attack specific previously untreated key component part pathophysiological cycle BOS , AAT therapy would decrease prevalence BOS lung transplant recipient prolong life expectancy patient .</brief_summary>
