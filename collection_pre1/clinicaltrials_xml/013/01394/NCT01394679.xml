	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study 99mTC-EC-DG SPECT/CT Versus PET/CT Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . To demonstrate SPECT/CT ( 99mTc EC DG ) inferior PET/CT ( 18F FDG PET/CT ) sensitivity specificity measure image interpretation primary metastatic lesion compare truth standard patient high likelihood lung cancer . 2 . To expand patient safety experience use 99mTc EC DG .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The subject male female patient least 18 year old . 2 . The subject must agree time enrollment follow procedure : A tissue diagnosis primary lesion either prior enrollment within 15 day PET/CT study initiation therapy A SPECT/CT procedure A baseline DCCT scan A wholebody bone scan A followup focus DCCT scan ( indicate ) 3 . The patient non incisional biopsy demonstrate definitive evidence lung cancer OR clinical evidence CT scan result consistent diagnosis lung cancer . Cytology result confirm lung cancer bronchoscope procedure also acceptable . A copy actual report ( biopsy/cytology CT scan ) must request patient medical release form already do . The copy must available study doctor within 15 day PET image study . 4 . The patient receive treatment lung cancer ( surgery , radiation , and/or chemotherapy ) , , patient lung cancer past , previous therapy complete least 3 month prior enrol study . 5 . If tissue diagnosis primary lesion do prior enrollment , patient must agree tissue diagnosis primary lesion within 15 day PET/CT study prior initiation therapy , independent PET/CT result . 6 . The patient must refer PET/CT scan basis clinical radiological ( CT ) evidence diagnosis lung cancer . 7 . The patient Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance rating &lt; = 2 . 8 . The patient male nonpregnant , nonlactating female postmenopausal , naturally surgically sterile , agree use effective contraceptive method throughout course study . Postmenopausal define least 12 month natural spontaneous amenorrhea , least 6 week follow surgical menopause ( bilateral oophorectomy ) . 9 . Females childbearing potential male female sexual partner childbearing potential must agree use one follow acceptable birth control method : 1 . Surgically sterile ( hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ) 2 . Surgically sterile ( bilateral tubal ligation surgery least 6 week prior study initiation documentation require ) 3 . Intrauterine device ( IUD ) place least 3 month 4 . Doublebarrier method ( condom diaphragm ) spermicide least 14 day prior screen study completion 5 . Stable hormonal contraceptive ( oral , topical , vaginal implanted/injected ) least 3 month prior study study completion 6 . Abstinence 7 . Singlebarrier method least 14 day prior screen study completion vasectomize male female vasectomize partner 10 . The patient fast blood glucose &lt; 200 mg/dL screening . 11 . The patient report clinical symptom consistent diagnosis lung cancer . 12 . The patient must able tolerate SPECT/CT PET/CT image . This include : 1. lie position without move approximately 45 minute 2. able tolerate confine area ( ie , claustrophobic ) 3. ability hold arm overhead approximately 45 minute 13 . The patient must able fast and/or follow diet restriction prior SPECT/CT PET/CT image . 14 . Patients must fast least 6 hour prior injection study . 15 . The patient must able eat high protein/low carbohydrate meal last meal SPECT/CT PET/CT imaging . However , site standard care requirement fast and/or diet restriction PET alternative recommendation , fast and/or diet restriction use PET image apply SPECT image . 16 . The patient must able make scheduled appointment within designated time window ( PET/CT image within 7 day qualify study , second imaging session SPECT/CT image 115 day initial imaging visit , least 24 hour PET/CT SPECT/CT image ) . 17 . The patient must safety laboratory value , opinion Investigator , place patient undue risk patient participate study . This include ( limited ) : 1. alanine aminotransferase &lt; = 2.5 × ULN 2. aspartate aminotransferase &lt; = 2.5 × ULN 3. creatinine &lt; = 2.5 × ULN 4. bilirubin &lt; = 2.0 × ULN 18 . The patient must able understand provide sign informed consent . 19 . Females childbearing potential must negative urine serum βhCG pregnancy test screening . 1 . Any clinically significant safety concern ( laboratory , EKG , physical examination , ) , opinion Investigator , would place patient undue risk patient participate study . 2 . The patient undergoing current treatment cancer ( radiation therapy , surgery , chemotherapy ) . 3 . The patient diabetic insulin dependence . ( Patients know insulin dependence diabetes include study standard care protocol place clinical site provide management patient 's glucose level sufficiently allow PET/CT imaging perform . The glucose management use PET/CT image apply SPECT/CT image procedure . A waiver require complete clinical site approve sponsor designee . ) 4 . The patient 's weight SPECT/CT PET/CT table weight limit . 5 . The patient know hypersensitivity EC DG FDG similar compound include inactive ingredient . 6 . The patient know suspected pregnancy , lactation plan pregnancy ( female male partner ) . 7 . The patient clinically significant mental illness ( determined Investigator ) . 8 . The patient exposure investigational agent within 30 day prior screen visit participate ongoing clinical study . ( This criterion overrule Principal Investigator appropriate documentation reason exception . ) 9 . The patient condition Investigator believe would interfere ability provide inform consent comply study instruction , might confound interpretation study result put patient undue risk .</criteria>
