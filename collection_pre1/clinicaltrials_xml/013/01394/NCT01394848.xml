	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Endothelial Progenitor Cell Capture Stent With 1 Months Dual Antiplatelet Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug-eluting stent ( DES ) improve angiographic clinical outcome patient complex coronary lesion high risk markedly reduce neointimal hyperplasia follow stent implantation comparison bare-metal stent ( BMS ) . Although concern long-term safety occurrence stent thrombosis follow DES implantation raise , recent DES-registry study report DES increase risk death stent thrombosis follow-up , compare BMS . However , currently , fatal event related stent thrombosis still occur major limitation use DES . Especially , late late thrombosis DES implantation uncommon life-threatening fatal complication present sudden death myocardial infarction ( MI ) . The powerful predictor stent thrombosis discontinuation clopidogrel . Then , circumstance , prolong dual antiplatelet therapy recommend , irrespective precise consideration accord type DES , lesion complexity , clinical characteristic . Although prolonged antiplatelet therapy prevent stent thrombosis , might cause problem combine bleed complication , high cost due prolong use , unnecessary maintenance medication . The stratified strategy regard antiplatelet therapy accord lesion complexity high risk diabetes acute coronary syndrome , regard prominent predictor stent thrombosis , require . Another difficult problem DES real world practice manage case clopidogrel discontinue due unexpected minor major operation invasive procedure . Because available substitute bridge therapy clopidogrel operation , many advisory group recommend hold elective non-cardiac surgery 12 month DES implantation . If , BMS implantation strongly recommend patient high risk bleed schedule unavoidable surgery within next 12 month . Especially elderly , premature discontinuation DAPT within 12 month PCI may occur due combine co-morbid disease require surgical intervention , decrease drug compliance , occurrence gastrointestinal bleeding . Recently , many attempt elucidate mechanism stent thrombosis perform . Finn AV et al . report human autopsy DES powerful histological predictor stent thrombosis endothelial coverage suggest stent strut coverage marker endothelialization . After , concern focus healthy healing DES implantation , spite relatively high late lumen loss . As result , antiplatelet therapy discontinue , DES healthy healing might prefer , instead efficient DES low late lumen loss . In view point , spite actual high late lumen loss , Endothelial Progenitor Cell ( EPC ) Capture Stent ( GENOUS™ Bio-engineered R stent™ , OrbusNeich ) could beneficial safe DES low risk stent thrombosis due rapid endothelialization result short-term use dual antiplatelet . EPC capture stent antibody immobilize stent surface capture circulate endothelial progenitor cell lead accelerated natural healing . Theoretically , EPC capture stent two benefit . It establish functional endothelium , therefore long term anti-platelet therapy require . Second , EPC capture stent may minimize restenosis , establish healthy endothelium express vasoactive compound , nitric oxide , modulate neo-intimal hyperplasia thus restenosis . Thanks rapid reendothelialization derive pro-healing property EPC capture stent , 1-month dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) recommend EPC capture stent implantation . Shorter maintenance dual antiplatelet therapy might minimize risk stent thrombosis case discontinuation antiplatelet regimen prevent wasteful medication bleed complication relate dual antiplatelet therapy . Thus , EPC capture stent might valuable elderly vulnerable premature discontinuation DAPT . On hand , statin upstream therapy gain popularity seem reduce periprocedural myocardial injury especially ACS pleiotrophic effect like plaque stabilization . However , benefit pretreatment statin patient stable angina remain controversial . It report statin administration could increase EPC level accelerate differentiation towards endothelial progenitor lineage . We hypothesize EPC capture stent 1-month dual antiplatelet therapy non-inferior DES elderly subject stable coronary artery disease . To test hypothesis , perform multi-center , randomize , prospective trial aim demonstrate efficacy safety EPC capture stent 1-month DATP versus EES standard 12-month DAPT elderly patient stable coronary occlusive disease real world practice .</detailed_description>
