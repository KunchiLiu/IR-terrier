	<brief_summary>Incretin-based therapy treatment patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2D ) new fundamentally different classical treatment oral antidiabetic agent insulin . The novel original aspect investigator-initiated study focus treatment incretin-based agent ( GLP-1 analogue liraglutide ) T2D patient severely reduce kidney function . At present virtually knowledge physiology clinical implication role incretin hormone incretin-based therapy group diabetic patients.The aim study establish evidence-based rationale introduce GLP-1 analogue limit armamentarium antidiabetic drug patient type T2D severe renal insufficiency . The overall hypothesis patient T2D severe renal insufficiency tolerate benefit treatment GLP-1 analogue liraglutide , hereby improve glycaemic control reduce risk factor cardiovascular disease</brief_summary>
