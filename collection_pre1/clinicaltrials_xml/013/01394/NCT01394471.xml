	<detailed_description>Overview Procedures : All procedure conduct UNC Hospitals Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) outpatient clinic outpatient North Carolina Psychiatric Research Center ( NCPRC ) , specialized program University North Carolina Center Excellence Community Mental Health Raleigh , NC . Except Screening , clinic visit begin 0800-1000 hour subject fast since midnight . Approximately 10 minute check clinic , subject ' weight vital sign measure follow blood urine sample collection . Breakfast serve . At regular interval clinic visit , subject allow rest 15-20 minute . Lunch also provide subject . Screening assessment : During initial clinic visit give informed consent , prospective subject ' psychiatric medical history review , physical exam conduct , EKGs run blood urine collect complete blood count ( CBC ) , electrolytes , liver/renal function test , TSH , glucose , urinalysis ( UA ) , pregnancy test , urine drug screen ( UDS ) . The Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV administer confirm diagnose one record within past two year . The WRAT administer determine reading ability well Reading Mind Eyes Test ( Eyes Test ) determine subject meet social cognition criterion impairment . Finally , PANSS Calgary Depression Scale rating obtain . Baseline Treatment Week 6 12 assessment : All primary secondary outcome measure obtain clinic visit Baseline ( occur within 1 week Screening assessment ) end treatment trial ( 12-week time point ) . Some outcome measure obtain clinic visit 6-week time point treatment trial . Subjects arrive clinic 8:00 10:00 a.m. visit give breakfast . At Baseline , administration assessment begin 10 min completion breakfast . At 6 12-week clinic visit , assessment begin 50 min intranasal administration test treatment ( give breakfast-see detail ) . The primary outcome social cognition measure ( detail ) : emotion recognition ( ER-40 , Eyes Test ) , theory mind ( Eyes Test , Brüne test ) , social perception ( Trustworthiness Task ) attributional style ( AIHQ ) . The secondary outcome ( detail ) social functioning ( SLOF ) , social skill ( role play ) , psychotic symptom ( PANSS ) , paranoia ( Green Paranoia Thought Scale ) , empathy ( IRI ) , non-social cognition ( RBANS ) , anxiety ( Liebowitz social anxiety scale ) depression ( Calgary Depression Rating Scale ) , social perception ( IPT-15 ) food craving ( Food Craving Inventory Night Eating Questionnaire ) . While ultimately want improve social functioning , acknowledge domain might slower improve social cognition , thus render secondary rather primary outcome ( reason , assess social function baseline week 12 ( end treatment ) ) . We include non-social cognition battery ass whether treatment effect social cognition generalize domains cognition . A similar sentiment underlies inclusion symptom ( psychotic general ) battery , value OT may enhance impact symptom might ultimately interfere treatment engagement . Finally , include empathy relationship theory mind . Test substance administration procedure treatment trial : During treatment trial , subject self-administer test treatment twice daily ; breakfast dinner . Each treatment consist 6 insufflation ( 0.1 ml ) Syntocinon Spray ( Novartis ) , contain 24 international unit OT , placebo solution contain ingredient Syntocinon Spray except OT . Blind-labeled test treatment vial dispense follow randomization scheme permute block 4 , stratify gender , oxytocin often different effect male female , animal human . Subjects self administer test treatment 60 ml spray vial ( eject 0.1 ml per spray ) initially contain 35 ml test substance . Each vial contains enough solution 3 week self administration . Subjects receive first vial test treatment right assessment complete Baseline clinic visit . They instruct intranasal self administration care test vial time give write instruction matter . They take first intranasal test dose observation research nurse leave clinic . Before leave clinic , subject give card date return appointment one week . Subjects return clinic 2 , 6 , 9 12 week time point treatment period . At 2 , 9-week visit , subject brief visit study clinician assess side effect , perform mental status examination , administer PANSS CGI . Spot urine pregnancy test also do 2 9 week visit . At baseline , 6 12-wk time point , subject arrive clinic 8:00 10:00 a.m. , fast overnight . Before eat breakfast , weight vital sign measurement obtain along blood urine sample . Blood collect baseline use measure serum glucose lipid urine use screen pregnancy woman drug screen subject . Blood urine sample obtain 6 12-week time point use measure obtain Screening visit . EKG also repeat 6 12-week time point . Prior breakfast 6 12-wk time point visit , subject self-administer morning dose observe research nurse sure process do correctly . To obtain plasma later assay OT concentration , blood drawn 40 minute morning test dose chill EDTA vacutainer tube immediately place ice bath spun within 20 minute . Plasma sample store ultralow temperature . OT level may reflect individual variability OT absorption metabolism covariate statistical analysis . Beginning 50 minute morning test dose ( 6 12-week treatment time point ) , primary secondary measure re-administered . Subjects bring used test treatment vial clinic visit 2 , 6 , 9 12-week time point treatment trial . At 2 , 6 9 wk time point , subject give fresh test treatment intranasal spray vial continue twice daily self administration next visit . Subjects may give two vial two week visit ensure enough study medication week 6 visit . Subjects call two day follow baseline visit remind take study medication . They call weekly reminder remainder study ( combine check call ) . Randomization plan : The statistician ( Dr. Hamer ) generate randomization plan randomize 27 subject OT treatment 27 subject placebo treatment use PROC PLAN SAS Version 9.2 . We use blocksize 4 within sex every 4 subject 's randomization two group equalize . The statistician export randomization plan spreadsheet , data manager import table study data management system . When subject randomize , authorize investigator ( data management system design allow different level function investigator ) need blind obtain randomization number data management system . This authorized investigator contact investigational drug service give randomization number , collect appropriate medication investigational drug service . Sources test treatment : Dr. Pedersen IND exemption ( # 77,774 ) FDA treat patient schizophrenia intranasal OT spray obtain overseas pharmacy . The IND exemption necessary intranasal OT spray ( Syntocinon Spray ) market USA since 1997 Novartis let FDA approval product lapse financial reason ( product prescribe frequently enough country warrant cost maintain FDA approval ) . Syntocinon Spray vial ( 5 ml ) order need international pharmacy . Triangle Compounding Pharmacy ( Cary , NC ) prepare intranasal spray vial contain 35 ml OT solution decant seven 5 ml Syntocinon Spray vials 60 ml spray vial . Triangle Compounding also prepare identical 60 ml spray vial contain 35 ml placebo solution contain ingredient Syntocinon Spray except OT . OT Syntocinon Spray remain stable least 1 month room temperature . Monitoring enhance compliance : Change 60 ml spray vial weight 3-4 week test treatment use monitor subject compliance . Each insufflation ( 0.1 ml ) decrease vial weight 0.1 gram . Subjects call week day morning remind take intranasal test treatment . Less 75 % anticipated decline vial weight may ground termination study , especially occur . Monitoring safety : Laboratory test , EKGs vital sign obtain 6 12-week time point . Abnormalities adverse event may result exclusion participation . The Barnes , Simpson-Angus , AIMS scale well general side effect checklist assist thorough assessment side effect . Medical evaluation Screening : During initial clinic visit give informed consent , prospective subject ' psychiatric medical history review , physical exam conduct , EKGs run blood urine collect CBC , electrolytes , liver/renal function test , TSH , glucose , UA , pregnancy test , drug screen . At baseline treatment trial : An extensive set lab value , EKGs vital sign obtain clinic visit 6 12 week test treatment period ( serum glucose lipid measure also obtain baseline ) . Subjects fast since midnight yet take morning test dose blood drawn urine collect shortly arrive baseline , week-6 week-12 clinic visit . Running laboratory test blood urine sample obtain fast state , time point , optimal rapid detection negative effect OT treatment subject ' physiology . It may also provide preliminary information influence OT adverse metabolic effect atypical antipsychotic medication subject take throughout study period . Vital sign repeat 2 hour subject take morning intranasal test dose 6 12-week time point . Spot urine pregnancy test obtain screening , baseline , week 2 , 6 , 9 12 clinic visit treatment trial . Social Cognition Measures ( Primary outcomes ) The Emotion Recognition-40 Task ( ER-40 , Kohler et al 2004 ) consist 40 face present sequentially computer screen along choice rating face happy , sad , anger , fear emotion . It use racially ethnically diverse face image psychometrically sound measure social cognition clinical population ( Carter et al 2009 ) . The Brüne Theory Mind Stories Task ( Brüne 2003 ) involve series 6 set 4 cartoon picture illustrate interaction two individual . The subject ask rearrange picture , initially present illogical sequence , order conveys logical story . The period time subject take complete task accuracy sequence record . Then , subject correctly organize picture ( do examiner subject 's response incorrect ) , subject ask question cartoon character ' belief beliefs character cartoon . The subject 's interpretation character ' belief score correct incorrect . The Reading Mind Eyes test ( Eyes Test , Baron-Cohen et al 2001 ) consist 36 photograph participant ask guess mental state ( i.e . person think feeling ) among 4 choice word . Participants give practice item ensure understand task . Each eye region present note card display computer screen four choice mental state show four corner card computer screen ( one target word three foil word ) . There time constraint choose mental state . A glossary mental state make available participant unsure meaning word . Performance measure number face correctly discriminate . The Trustworthiness Task ( Adolphs et al 1998 ) comprise 42 face unfamiliar people . Participants show picture individually ( computer monitor ) ask rate much would trust person ( i.e. , money life ) 7-point scale , range -3 ( untrustworthy ) +3 ( trustworthy ) . The Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire ( AIHQ , Combs et al 2007 ) comprise 15 short vignette reflect negative event vary intentionality ( i.e. , obvious , accidental , ambiguous intention ) . Participants ask read vignette , imagine scenario happen her/him ( e.g. , `` You walk past bunch teenager mall hear start laugh '' ) , write reason person ( person ) act way toward her/him ( mean measure attribution ) . Two independent raters subsequently code write response purpose compute `` hostility bias '' . The participant rate , Likert scale , whether person ( person ) perform action purpose ( anchored [ 1 ] , definitely , [ 6 ] , definitely yes ) , angry would make her/him feel ( anchor [ 1 ] , angry , [ 5 ] , angry ) , much would blame person ( person ) ( anchor [ 1 ] , , [ 5 ] , much ) . Finally , participant ask write she/he would respond situation , later cod 2 independent raters compute `` aggression index . '' Social Function Measures ( Secondary outcomes ) The Specific Levels Functioning Scale 30-item questionnaire recently find excellent measure social general real-world functioning . The questionnaire 2 social functioning subsection ( Interpersonal Relationships , Social Acceptability ) 2 community living skill subsection ( Activities , Work Skills ) . One version complete subject another complete informant , meet follow criterion : ) psychotic disorder , b ) literate , c ) know subject least 1 year , ) spend time subject regular basis ( e.g. , case worker , clinician , family member , caretaker ) . After give informed consent , criterion review prospective informant . Informants compensate complete questionnaire . The informant questionnaire ask well she/he know affect participant . Each item rat 5-point Likert scale anchor describe frequency behavior and/or patient 's level independence . To informant understand item SLOF , instrument administer member research team informant either person , convenient , phone . The Social Competence test consist two 90-second role-plays . The first role-play unstructured conversation research confederate play role new neighbor subject instruct strike conversation . In second role-play , research confederate play upset friend subject instruct attempt console . The role play record later score conversational skill ( e.g . overall social skill ; affect ; speech content , etc ) ability perceive distress others ( e.g. , emotional empathy ; cognitive empathy ) . We use similar role play past . The Cyberball Task computerize ball toss game investigate effect favor and/or ostracize four fundamental need ; belonging , control , self-esteem , meaningful existence . The Interpersonal Perception Task ( IPT-15 ) video task measure non-verbal perception . It consist video 15 brief scene ( 28-122 second ) pair question two three possible answer , allow subject `` decode '' something important people scene . Empathy Motivation Measures ( Secondary outcomes ) The Interpersonal Reactivity Index empathy self-report measure cognitive affective empathy . The IRI consist 28 item participant rate well item describes use five point scale . The 28 item yield four subscales : perspective taking ( PT ) , empathic concern ( EC ) , fantasy ( F ) , personal distress ( PD ) . The PT subscale measure tendency take another 's point view ( e.g. , `` I sometimes try understand friend well imagine thing look perspective. '' ) . The EC subscale measure feeling sympathy concern others ( e.g. , `` I often tender , concerned feeling people less fortunate me. '' ) . The F subscale measure ability imagine oneself role fictitious character book ( e.g. , `` When I read interest story novel , I imagine I would feel event story happen me. '' ) . The PD subscale measure personal feeling anxiety unease interpersonal setting ( e.g. , `` Being tense emotional situation scar me. '' ) . The IRI use previously assess self-reported empathy individual schizophrenia . Non-social cognitive Measures ( Secondary outcome ) The Repeatable Battery Assessment Neuropsychological Status administer measure cognitive ability : immediate memory , delayed memory , visual-spatial , language attention . The assessment take 20-25 minute complete administer trained research assistant . The RBANS allow u determine relationship neurocognitive ability social cognitive ability , particularly regard accuracy theory mind test emotion perception . Psychiatric Measures ( Secondary outcomes ) The Positive Negative Symptoms Scale 30-item scale interviewer rate subject severity positive negative psychotic symptom , general symptom ask standard series question . Items rat scale 1 ( absent ) 7 ( severe ) , yield five scaled score : positive symptom , negative symptom , dysphoric mood , activation , autistic preoccupation . The Green Paranoia Thought Scale consist two 16-item scale ass idea social reference persecution . The Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI ) Severity Scale widely use scale schizophrenia research repeat evaluation global psychopathology . The CGI-S single Likert scale rating severity psychopathology time rating scale 1 ( normal , ill ) 7 ( severely ill ) . Patients assessed basis rater 's total clinical experience . The Calgary Depression Rating Scale interviewer-rated measure depression individual schizophrenia . The Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale questionnaire list 24 social situation subject rate ( 0-3 ) much fear/anxiety he/she would experience much he/she would avoid situation ( 0-3 ) . Other Measures Food Cravings Night Eating Questionnaires . Atypical antipsychotic medication , ( subject take ) , increase appetite may contribute weight gain . Oxytocin known affect food intake animal . Therefore , include measure use previous study weight gain/appetite change patient take atypical antipsychotic medication .</detailed_description>
