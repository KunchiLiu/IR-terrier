	<brief_summary>The aim study identify risk factor associate delirium hospitalize person dementia , describe immediate post-hospital ( 1 &amp; 3 month ) trajectory cognitive decline associate outcomes person dementia develop delirium . It hypothesize factor CNS-active medication , urinary tract infection , stage dementia , pain , activity level , dehydration would associate increased risk delirium delirium severity patient dementia compare dementia patient without delirium . It also hypothesize person DSD bad outcome ( long hospital length stay , decrease functional status , steeper negative slope cognitive decline ) dementia patient without delirium . Lastly , hypothesize high delirium severity would associate poor outcome person dementia . The long-term objective use result study design test intervention strategy improve early recognition , management , prevention , outcomes person DSD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It well known person dementia increase risk develop delirium acute confusional state . Further , current evidence suggest delirium may worsen prognosis dementia , may alter clinical course trajectory cognitive decline , may associate substantially bad long-term outcome . This study prospective cohort study design involve 165 hospitalized subject dementia 65 older include three month follow period . Aims study include : 1 ) identify risk factor DSD , 2 ) describe post-hospital outcome trajectory cognitive decline DSD , justify development appropriate preventative management strategy delirium patient dementia . Delirium assess daily admission discharge one three month follow-up . The potential risk factor examine 1 ) polypharmacy ( central nervous system-active medication , number medication , new medication add ) , 2 ) physical stressor ( urinary tract infection , pain , dehydration ) , 3 ) environmental stressor ( bedrest , restraint , room change ) . Outcomes assess research study staff blind study aim .</detailed_description>
