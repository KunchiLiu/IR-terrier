	<brief_summary>Background : - Research suggest occupational exposure formaldehyde associate increase risk myeloid leukemia , significance finding uncertain inconsistency among study lack knowledge formaldehyde cause leukemia . - Damage DNA myeloid cell ( type white blood cell ) environmental factor affect cell genetic machinery may involve . Objective : To determine formaldehyde exposure associate genetic change myeloid cell . Eligibility : Workers expose high level formaldehyde unexposed worker Guangdong Province , China . Design : - 40 exposed worker 40 unexposed worker enrol . - Subjects wear small instrument work measure chemical air 1 2 day . - Subjects brief physical examination provide blood , urine , mouth rinse sample . - Subjects answer questionnaire work , smoke drinking , use medicine , medical history , general health , exposure radiation exposure various substance home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research industrial worker professional expose formaldehyde suggests occupational exposure important chemical associate increase risk myeloid leukemia . The significance , however , observation occupational environmental health uncertain inconsistency among epidemiologic study lack demonstrated mechanism formaldehyde cause leukemia . Cytogenetic damage one potential leukemogenic mechanism , study formaldehyde-exposed human . Some experimental data suggest epigenetic change myeloid cell could also involve . We plan study 40 worker expose high level formaldehyde 40 unexposed control examine hypothesis formaldehyde associate change . To determine formaldehyde exposure , incorporate number method , include questionnaire determine potential past exposure on-site monitoring determine current average peak intensity exposure . We examine difference aneuploidy structural abnormality myeloid progenitor cell culture peripheral blood . We specifically look difference gene associate myeloid leukemia monosomy 7 trisomy 8 use interphase Octochrome FISH . We also determine whether aberrant methylation progenitor cell , specifically hypermethylation gene associate myeloid leukemia , high expose formaldehyde . This study substantially contribute understand leukemogenic potential formaldehyde , important public health regulatory implication .</detailed_description>
