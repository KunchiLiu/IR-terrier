	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine drug call sorafenib shrink LGA tumor ( low-grade astrocytomas ) child adult . Previous research give u well understand type tumor study genetic `` make-up '' LGAs . From research , investigator find drug call sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block molecule need cell growth block blood flow tumor . This trial study well sorafenib work treat patient LGAs , effect relate specific genetic `` make-up '' particular tumor . This test tumor 's genetic make-up optional require available tumor tissue test . In summary , aim study : To see sorafenib shrink LGAs ; well sorafenib tolerate patient LGAs ; , effect sorafenib relate genetic make-up individual LGAs ( Optional Study )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Novel therapy urgently need child relapse LGA surgical candidate and/or exhaust standard chemotherapy approach . Although vast number `` molecular target '' agent develop past decade treatment cancer , none evaluate treatment LGAs . Recently , genetic alteration result oncogenic BRAF identify highly prevalent LGAs , provide rational target therapeutic intervention . The aims clinical trial estimate efficacy , well safety tolerability sorafenib , RAF tyrosine kinase receptor inhibitor , treatment pediatric patient recurrent LGA . Sorafenib target several pathway , base preliminary data u others , likely contribute growth LGAs : oncogenic BRAF , present majority grade I LGAs VEGFR2 PDGFR , well-described mediator tumor angiogenesis . Since sorafenib inhibits number additional kinase whose role LGA growth yet explore , possible inhibition pathway primary target may result additional anti-tumor effect sorafenib LGA . Although investigator hypothesize LGAs oncogenic BRAF sensitive sorafenib , additional target sorafenib may also result significant anti-tumor effect LGAs wild-type BRAF . Therefore , investigator propose evaluate efficacy sorafenib child LGAs translational clinical trial , stratify BRAF status tumor grade . The investigator expect learn follow clinical translational trial : - The anti-tumor activity sorafenib pediatric LGAs - The safety tolerability sorafenib pediatric patient LGAs - The association molecular target expression , e.g . oncogenic BRAF , response rate The investigator use result clinical translational trial determine sorafenib warrant clinical study pediatric LGAs . If investigator find association molecular target expression response , study may limited focus patient whose tumor specific molecular feature , oncogenic BRAF . Sorafenib also show promise combination classic chemotherapy give together carboplatin , one active agent LGAs . Therefore , possible synergy sorafenib traditional chemotherapy use treatment LGAs , carboplatin , could explore future clinical trial .</detailed_description>
