	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety efficacy investigational neuromuscular blocking agent call CW002 document effect healthy adult volunteer . A neuromuscular blocking agent drug temporarily prevent muscle move . CW002 yet approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Usually , neuromuscular block agent use together drug put people completely `` asleep '' . These drug allow doctor place breathe tube airway , stop muscle move surgical operation , allow ventilation ( movement air ) . This research do CW002 expect act quickly provide muscle block intermediate ( long , short ) duration . The researcher would like test increase dos CW002 give without cause severe side effect . If show safe effective , compound would useful surgical procedure could improve future anesthetic care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Clinical Trial Evaluate Safety , Pharmacokinetics Efficacy CW002</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular block agent especially important intubation ( insertion breathe tube windpipe ) quick effective muscle block need promptly complete process secure airway . In addition , able rapidly reverse block agent desirable patient breathe his/her soon possible .</detailed_description>
