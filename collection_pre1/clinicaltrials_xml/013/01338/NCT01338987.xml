	<brief_summary>Background : - One way treat certain cancer blood immune system give patient stem cell bone marrow donor whose gene similar identical patient s. One problem transplant new immune cell may work well recipient donor . The result may immune system work well . This increase risk severe infection complication . - Researchers study use drug low hormone level may allow immune system recover way improve white blood cell function . In study look drug lupron , drug lower estrogen testosterone level , see might improve function newly transplant cell . Objectives : - To determine whether lupron improve immune system function bone marrow transplantation donor similarity immune cell ( match ) . - To evaluate effectiveness nuclear medicine test radiotracer drug FLT imaging study . FLT use image immune system function patient receive bone marrow donor . Eligibility : - People 15 ( young 9 go puberty ) 40 year age . These patient must acute myelogenous leukemia , acute lymphocytic leukemia , high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome . They must also eligible bone marrow transplant . - Genetically similar donor patient eligible transplant . Design : - People take part study screen physical examination , medical history , blood urine test , image study . Patients remission require bone marrow donor search may receive chemotherapy first . - Donors provide bone marrow transplant accord standard bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) procedure . - All woman half men receive regular lupron dose 2 week BMT suppress hormone function . - All recipient receive 4 day radiation follow 2-4 day chemotherapy bone marrow transplant ( depend age ) . Recipients also receive drug prevent transplant rejection complication transplantation . - Recipients monitor hospital 4 week transplant blood test study . - Some recipient image study FLT protocol . These image study take place transplant , day 5 28 transplant , later time determine study researcher . - Following discharge , participant monitor closely 6 month , regular less frequent followup visit least 5 year . Study-related medication , include vaccination new immune system , provide National Institutes Health hospital stay discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Lupron Improve Immune Function After Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Impaired lymphocyte immune reconstitution associate morbidity mortality follow allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . - Data suggest one limitation immunity HSCT lack thymus recovery proper B cell development . - Androgen withdrawal show enhance T B lymophopoiesis . - Lupron approve , safe , gonadotropin release hormone ( GnRH ) agonist/antagonist . - Noninvasive imaging modality study immune reconstitution would invaluable predict optimal impair immune recovery permit early institution therapy . - FLT 3 -deoxy-3 18F-fluorothymidine , radiolabeled thymidine analogue illustrate divide hematopoietic cell may predict immune recovery allogeneic HSCT . - FLT use safely patient receive intensive chemotherapy . Objectives : - Primary : To determine Lupron improve B lymphocyte reconstitution HSCT . - Primary : To assess whether 18F FLT PET/CT could predict early engraftment/immune reconstitution marrow thymus allogeneic HSCT . - Primary : To assess safety Lupron 2nd HSCT evaluate separate arm . Eligibility : - Patients &gt; 9 year old pubertal and/or &gt; 15 year less equal 55 year , aggressive leukemia ( Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) high risk cytogenetics , Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ( ALL ) , CMML , certain CML ) require HSCT enrol NCI . - At University Oklahoma , Age &gt; 17 year old less equal 55 year recipient . - Patients &gt; 4 &lt; 24 year diseases enrolled Children National Medical Center . Design : - This prospective pilot study , primary aim : 1 ) ass whether Lupron enhance lymphocyte recovery HSCT 2 ) whether FLT image use predict engraftment/immune reconstitution , 3 ) whether Lupron FLT tolerable second HSCT . - At NCI Univ Oklahoma , post-pubertal pediatric male patient ( &lt; 18 year ) randomize receive 3 month ( 11.25 mg ) injection adult male patient randomized receive 4-month preparation Lupron ( 30 mg ) placebo two week preparative regimen first BMT . Women individual undergo 2nd BMT receive Lupron dose per age evaluate treated cohort . At Children National Medical Center , patient receive Lupron outside context clinical care , receive myeloablative HSCT per standard care FLT image engraftment primary endpoint . - A target 68 evaluable adult patient enrol trial , may necessitate 118 patient ( 118 donor ) enrol reach target NCI University Oklahoma . A total 10 pediatric patient enrol Children National Medical Center FLT image . Sixteen patient enrol undergo second BMT . - At NCI , adult great 18 year old female adult male patient undergo 2nd BMT receive 4-month preparation Lupron ( 30 mg ) two week preparative regimen . All patient undergo FLT image evaluate whether may predict HSCT response failure ( relapse ) . This pilot arm 16 patient total . - The planned length trial 7 year interim analysis day 100 day 365 . - Some patient anticipate evaluated use FLT ( include patient needed immunological primary endpoint , increase total patient number ) . 23 adult NCI patient total undergo FLT PET/CT image day -1 , day +5 day +9 , 4 week , future point include evidence GVHD relapse , immune recovery . An estimated 50 patient ( include subset 23 patient undergoing serial scanning ) image approximately 1 year evaluation thymus reconstitution . The total possible number include 118 patient achieve 68 evaluable adult immunological primary endpoint . However , NCI patient undergo single 1 year FLT evaluation thymus reconstitution . 10 pediatric patient CNMC undergo FLT PET/CT image Day -1 , day+9 , day +28 ( possible ) . Initial image correlate engraftment secondary endpoint . -Study endpoint include : 1 ) safety Lupron context allogeneic BMT , 2 ) lymphocyte reconstitution Lupron administration , 3 ) incidence acute chronic GVHD infectious complication , 4 ) remission rate HSCT .</detailed_description>
