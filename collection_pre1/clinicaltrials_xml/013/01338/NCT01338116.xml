	<brief_summary>Severe bacterial infection associate mortality 30 % . Patients moderate severe bacterial infection give early appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment lesser risk fatal outcome , odds ratio range 1.6 6.9 . However 2/3 patient worldwide give early appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment . About 40 % patient treated antibiotic give superfluous treatment . TREAT computerized decision support system antibiotic treatment inpatient common bacterial infection . TREAT base state art stochastic model domain ( causal probabilistic network ) use cost benefit model antibiotic treatment , include cost assign future resistance . It test randomize control trial 3 country show improve percentage appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment time reduce hospital stay use broad-spectrum antibiotic . The main limitation TREAT inherent limit information available within hour presentation . A second attractive approach improve antibiotic treatment use technique depend culture , thus shorten time identification pathogen hour . The LightCycler® SeptiFast test Roche perform vitro nucleic acid amplification test pathogens cause bloodstream infection . The purpose clinical trial show combined system TREAT/PCR assay improve outcome inpatient moderate severe bacterial infection , time reduce use broad-spectrum antibiotic , little additional cost . A secondary objective ass sensitivity specificity whole blood PCR , use TREAT reference standard .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The rationale study address patient antibiotic treatment , , consider . Thus include consecutive patient detect medical department accord follow criterion : 1 . Patients blood culture draw 2 . All patient antibiotic treatment ( prophylaxis intraperitoneal , inhalation local antibiotic therapy ) start within last 96 day 3 . Patients fulfil CDC diagnostic criterion infection ( see appendix C ) 4 . Patients temperature ≥38.3 measure orally ( 38 axillary 38.5 rectal ) single measurement ≥38 / &lt; 36 least 2 consecutive measurement separate least 1 hr apart one next criterion : ( ) heart rate &gt; 90 beats/minute ; ( b ) respiratory rate &gt; 20 breaths/minute partial pressure CO2 &lt; 32 mm Hg ; ( c ) white blood cell count &gt; 12,000/ L , &lt; 4000 L , &gt; 10 % immature ( band ) form . 5 . Patients shock compatible septic shock . As defined hypotension ( arterial blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg systolic , 40 mmHg le patient 's normal blood pressure ) least 1 h despite adequate fluid resuscitation ; Or Need vasopressor maintain systolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg mean arterial pressure &gt; 70 mmHg suspect source infection . 1 . HIV positive patient opportunistic infection ( suspected proven ) / AIDS define illness last 6 month prior data collection . 2 . Children &lt; 18 year . 3 . Suspected travel infection . 4 . Suspected tuberculosis . 5 . Pregnancy . 6 . We exclude patient able sign inform consent legal guardian willing .</criteria>
