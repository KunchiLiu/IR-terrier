	<brief_summary>Urinary incontinence radical prostatectomy significant clinical problem despite advance surgical technique . In literature , incidence post prostatectomy urinary incontinence varies widely 0.5 87 % ( Parekh et al , 2003 ) . Various reason hold responsible wide discrepancy , include surgical technique , definition incontinence , time evaluation , pathological stage , patient age . The etiology post prostatectomy urinary incontinence attribute sphincteric deficiency , either injury striate muscle fibre innervate nerve fibre ( Koelbl et al 2002 ) . The effect urinary incontinence quality life patient subject debate ( Litwin et al , 1995 ; Braslis et al , 1995 ) . For many patient , however , early recovery urinary incontinence major concern ( Moore et al , 1999 ) , especially young patient . Various treatment modality post prostatectomy urinary incontinence introduce , include conservative managemnt pelvic floor muscle training , pharmacological treatment surgical treatment . However , surgery invasive procedure 's usually last resort . Although Cochrane Incontinence Group ( 2007 ) comment need ongoing research clarify role pelvic floor muscle training , still first-line treatment use restore pelvic floor bladder function radical prostatectomy ( MacDonald et . al. , 2007 ) . Currently , patient learn pelvic floor muscle training day admission surgery ward staff HA hospital Hong Kong . Subsequently , removal urethral catheter , patient attend nurse-led clinic reassessment reinforcement pelvic floor muscle training . The continence rate define zero pad 69 % , 78.7 % 88.9 % 3 month , 6 month 12 month respectively ( Tam Ho et al. , 2010 ) . In order determine efficacy intensive preoperative pelvic floor muscle train decrease post-prostatectomy urinary incontinence , randomize control trial conduct . Participants intervention group would start pelvic floor muscle train 3 week surgery provide urology nurse specialist whereas control group would start pelvic floor muscle training day admission surgery provide ward staff . Measurement grams urine loss , sense self control urination quality life collect 4 , 8 , 12 24 week surgery comparison two group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer one important health problem men . According information Centre Health Promotion ( CHP ) January 2010 , prostate cancer record large increase incidence rate among common male cancer Hong Kong past two decade . In 2007 , prostate cancer fourth common cancer men 1 205 newly diagnose case prostate cancer . It account 9.2 % new cancer case male . It fifth lead cause male cancer death Hong Kong . In 2008 , total 282 men die cancer , account 3.8 % male cancer death . For patient disease confine prostate , several treatment alternative available . However , radical prostatectomy remain standard long-term cure ( Guidelines American Urological Association , 2010 ) . The incidence incontinence erectile dysfunction high operation therapy localize prostate cancer ( Alivizatos , et al , 2005 ) . Based literature review , post prostatectomy urinary incontinence ( PPUI ) rate range 0.5-87 % ( Parekh , et al , 2003 ) potency rate range 11-87 % ( Alivizatos , et al , 2005 ) . Various reason hold responsible wide discrepancy , include surgical technique , definition incontinence , time evaluation , pathological stage , patient age ( Pannek &amp; Konig , 2005 ) . However , majority patient undergoing radical prostatectomy would vote operation put tumour free first priority ( Alivizatos , et al. , 2005 ) . The cause urinary incontinence radical prostatectomy completely understood , leakage think result primarily sphincteric insufficiency , result sphincteric injury detrusor overactivity effect bladder detrusor muscle ( Leach , 1995 ) . Men afflict urinary incontinence must contend shame , embarrassment , depression , avoidance social activity alter life style ( Braslis et al. , 1995 ; Herr , 1994 ) . So , early appropriate management urinary incontinence improve one 's quality life reduce adverse consequence urinary incontinence lower physical health cause disability dependence , affect psychological well-being social functioning ; well escalate health care cost ( White &amp; Getliffe , 2003 ; Wyman , 2003 ) . Sueppel et al . ( 2001 ) find pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) teach pre operatively help patient achieve continence quicker teach post operatively . There significant improvement intervention group objectively weight pad every visit ( pad weight : 2.8 g intervention group whereas 33.3 g control group ) . Previously , Bales et al . ( 2000 ) recruit 100 men schedule undergo radical prostatectomy randomize receive PFMT biofeedback 2-4 week surgery nurse pre post operatively group receive briefly verbal instruction PFMT without biofeedback . Six month follow surgery , continence rate , define use one pad less per day 96 % ( 44 47 ) 96 % ( 48 50 ) biofeedback control group respectively . The author conclude pre operative formal PFMT biofeedback training improve outcome PFMT overall continence measure number pad use rate return urinary control men undergo radical prostatectomy 6 month ( p=0.596 ) . Among study review , efficacy pre operative PFMT early regaining urinary control radical prostatectomy still inconclusive . Thus , study PFMT PPUI need ( Centemero &amp; Rigatti , et al. , 2010 ) .</detailed_description>
