	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give oxaliplatin pemetrexed disodium together work treat patient refractory hormone-resistant prostate cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Pemetrexed disodium may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving oxaliplatin together pemetrexed disodium may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oxaliplatin Pemetrexed Disodium Treating Patients With Refractory Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response PSA Working Group criterion , overall clinical benefit define summation RECIST complete response ( CR ) plus RECIST partial response ( PR ) plus PSA PRs . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time progression patient hormone-refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) receive oxaliplatin pemetrexed . II . To describe safety profile treatment . III . Pain response evaluate exploratory manner . IV . Undertake pilot analysis excision repair cross-complementing 1 ( ERCC1 ) expression level polymorphisms , look ability predict response platinum therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour pemetrexed disodium IV day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
