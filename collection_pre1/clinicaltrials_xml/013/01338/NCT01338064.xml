	<detailed_description>Study participant would recruit two year study . They ask come single visit Pulmonary Laboratory Tel Aviv Medical Center . During meeting , participant give precise explanation test perform sign inform consent perform follow test : 1 . Induced sputum ( IS ) - do pretreatment short act beta-2 agonist 3 % saline administrate ultrasonic nebulizer 20 min . Differential cell count , particle size distribution test particulate matter ( Eyetech Analyzer ( Ankersmid , Yokneam , Israel ) do IS samples evaluation activity Heme oxygenase 1 ( HO-1 ) protein IS supernatant . 2 . EBC-Exhaled Breath Condensate-will do condensation expiratory air particulate matter marker oxidation measure . 3 . Participants ask complete occupational questionnaire . 4 . Pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) : The measurement perform use standard protocol accord American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society ( ATS/ERS ) guideline . Including Lung diffusion test . Laboratory test induce sputum EBC do within week participant visit . Analysis data do completion data collection laboratory test .</detailed_description>
