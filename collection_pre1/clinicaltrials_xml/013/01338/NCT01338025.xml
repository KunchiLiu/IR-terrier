	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare use lamivudine ( 3TC ) emtricitabine ( FTC ) alone vs. continue fail highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) regimen HIV infect child , adolescent young adult . The study see change HIV virus difference immune function , viral load medication side effect two group 28 week . Participants assign either take 3TC FTC alone continue his/her current fail HAART regimen . During first 28 week study , participant randomize continue HAART arm , he/she switch different new , potentially suppressive HAART regimen , continue current fail HAART regimen . However , continue HAART , participant might switch new regimen provider felt clinically need participant meet certain study endpoint ( e.g. , drop CD4 , increase viral load ) . At end 28 week , participant choice remain assign study group medication ( ) start new HAART regimen prescribe his/her doctor . Then , would follow another 24 week compare difference immune function , viral load medication side effect different group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation 3TC FTC Mono-therapy Compared Continuing HAART Bridging Strategy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , clear consensus manage virologic failure . Generally , failure non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) -based therapy due non-adherence associated high rate NNRTI resistance , failure protease inhibitor ( PI ) -based therapy due non-adherence carry much low risk PI resistance . In set incomplete adherence virologic failure despite adherence education , optimal strategy would one effectively bridge period cessation fail regimen highly active antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy initiation new HAART regimen . This would provide time intervention improve adherence effective minimize accumulation additional drug resistance mutation . Given compel need effective bridging strategy , limited evidence safety efficacy bridge regimen , high level acceptability study 3TC FTC monotherapy effective alternative , P1094 propose conduct randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) compare use 3TC FTC monotherapy short-term bridge regimen vs. continuation non-suppressive HAART non-adherent subject . This study close early due lack accrual , 33 target 344 participant enrol . Therefore analysis , include analysis primary outcome , descriptive . Only analyse Step 1 could do ( Step 2 observational ) . The following secondary analysis could perform : Changes Genotypic HIV Drug Resistance From Baseline Changes HIV Replication Capacity [ Time Frame : 28 52 week ] Changes CD4 Percent CD4+ T Cell Count [ Time Frame : 52 week ] Changes HIV-1 RNA Levels [ Time Frame : 52 Weeks ] Changes Immune Activation [ Time Frame : 28 52 Weeks ] Number Percent Subjects With Adverse Clinical Outcomes [ Time Frame : 52 Weeks ] Adherence Measured 3-day Recall [ Time Frame : 52 Weeks ]</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Step 1 Age great equal 8 less 25 year age , study entry Documentation HIV1 infection define positive result two sample collect different time point Treatment experience patient must demonstrate failure current HAART regimen 2 month longer . These patient must ARVs least total 6 month prior entry . Thus , fail regimen first ARV regimen , patient must initial regimen minimum 6 month total . CD4+ T cell count great equal 100 cells/mm3 ( confirm least two occasion within 6 month study entry , include screen value ) Documentation M184V mutation genotypic test time prior study entry In best judgment clinical site team , concern subject 's ability adhere make unsuitable initiate new optimal HAART regimen least 6 month . Subject become adherent despite site 's adherence intervention Female subject reproductive potential engage sexual activity could lead pregnancy agree avoid pregnancy entire 52 week trial consistently appropriately use least two follow contraception method : condom , diaphragm cervical cap spermicide , IUD , hormonalbased contraception . A list acceptable method find FDA Birth Control Guide ( http : //www.fda.gov/womens ) . Parent/legal guardian subject able willing provide sign informed consent applicable Step 1 Positive hepatitis B surface antigen know active hepatitis B infection . Pregnant breastfeeding . Active malignancy within past 2 year . Current immunosuppressive therapy , include equivalent great 1 mg/kg/per day great 20 mg total daily dose prednisone 2 week precede screen . Subjects longterm systemic corticosteroid therapy ( great 2 week ) anticipate exclude . [ Note : nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent inhale , nasal , topical corticosteroid exclude immunosuppressive therapy . ] Prior immunization HIVspecific vaccine Greater equal 1 CDC class C event within past 12 month . Renal disease ( define estimate creatinine clearance le 50 mL/min/1.73m2 confirm two occasion within 3 month screen ) . Active opportunistic infection , include active tuberculosis ( TB ) . Current treatment active systemic TB . If recent , infection must complete treatment course . INH treatment latent TB allow . Viral load great 250,000 copies/mL screening . Known great equal Grade 3 follow laboratory toxicity within 30 day prior study entry : neutrophil count , hemoglobin , platelet , AST , ALT , lipase , serum creatinine . Note : Subjects could rescreened enrol repeat value less Grade 3 without sign symptom related organ dysfunction . Known great equal Grade 4 laboratory toxicity within 30 day prior study entry , except approval study team . For subject take 3TC FTC time screening : Documented prior intolerance adverse effect reasonably attribute 3TC FTC result permanent discontinuation . Problems nonadherence attribute modifiable structural barrier , lack resource ( e.g. , insurance , transportation ) . Step 2 Inclusion Criteria Met requirement completion Step 1 Subject/guardian agree continue participation Step 2 ViroSeq assay result receive site review investigator</criteria>
