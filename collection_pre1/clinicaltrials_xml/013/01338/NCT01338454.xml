	<brief_summary>Obstetrical hemorrhage account nearly one quarter maternal death worldwide common cause maternal death Turkey [ 1,2 ] . Most deaths occur within 4 h delivery result problem third fourth stage labor . It also contribute significantly serious maternal morbidity . Obstetric , surgical radiological intervention play central role management obstetric hemorrhage ; however , pharmacologic management particular prohemostatic therapy also play important role final maternal outcome . Administration tranexamic acid ( TA ) , intravenously third stage labor may one method . TA synthetic derivate amino acid lysine , antifibrinolytic reversibly inhibit activation plasminogen , thus inhibit fibrinolysis reduce bleeding . TA may enhance effectiveness patient 's hemostatic mechanism [ 3,4 ] . In nonobstetric surgery , systematic review randomize control trail show tranexamic acid reduce risk blood transfusion [ relative risk ( RR ) 0.61 ; 95 % CI 0.54-0.69 ] also reduce need re-operation result bleeding ( RR 0.67 ; 95 % CI 0.41-1.09 ) . There evidence increase risk thrombotic event [ 5 ] . In gynecology obstetrics , TA commonly use treat idiopathic menorrhagia , effective well-tolerated treatment administer orally [ 5,6,7 ] . Bleeding associated pregnancy ( placental abruption , placenta previa ) also treat TA [ 6 ] . Furthermore , four randomize control study show TA reduces postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) follow cesarean delivery [ 7-11 ] . Only one randomize trail available evaluate effect TA use prevent bleed postpartum period follow spontaneous vaginal delivery [ 12 ] . The purpose study estimate effect addition intravenous TA standard active management third stage labor ( include prophylactic injection 10 IU oxytocin within two minute birth , early clamp umbilical cord , control cord traction ) .</brief_summary>
