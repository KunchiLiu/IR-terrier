	<brief_title>Study Tolerant Kidney Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following kidney ( renal ) transplantation , one possible complication rejection new kidney . This occur result body 's immune system attack ( reject ) newly transplant kidney . After transplant , medicine know `` immunosuppressive '' `` anti-rejection '' drug give transplant recipient help prevent rejection transplant kidney . If transplant recipient stop take medicine , almost always reject transplanted kidney . However , exceptionally rare instance , transplant recipient stop take drug reject kidney , kidney keep work . The recipient say point `` tolerate '' transplant kidney , condition refer `` tolerance '' . In study , participant ask provide consent collection extensive demographic clinical information ; medical history ; blood urine sample . Blood urine sample collect used perform specific assay help define mechanisms tolerance . Originally study include 11 group list ; however , present group 1,4 , 8 remain active . Whereas initial study duration 6 year , extend 11 year order follow extend time B cell signature identify tolerant kidney subject signature may change . ( Refer publication section : Newell , Kirk et al , J Clin Invest . 2010 ) .</detailed_description>
