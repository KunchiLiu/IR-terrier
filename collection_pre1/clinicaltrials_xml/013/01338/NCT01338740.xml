	<brief_summary>Switching Adalimumab proven efficacious Crohn 's disease ( CD ) patient intolerance loss response Infliximab . Currently study efficacy switch Infliximab patient loss response primary non-response Adalimumab . Even rheumatology , switch class anti-TNFα biologicals common practice , scientific data switch humanize chimeric anti-TNFα antibody . The purpose study document efficacy switch identify possible predictive factor success . If treatment Adalimumab fail ( despite optimal dose interval ) treat physician therefore decide switch infliximab , patient may enrol observational study . At regular interval ( every Remicade ) , patient clinically re-evaluated . The disease activity score calculate : Crohn 's disease activity index ( CDAI ) . At regular interval , result interim blood test document ( 3x ) . The succession 1 year . At week 10 , 26 52 , additional serum sample take determination antibody Adalimumab Infliximab . The serum level Adalimumab ( week 0 ) Infliximab ( week 10 , 26 52 ) determine . For study specific therapy change . The study want document result therapy switch , current clinical practice , make treat physician .</brief_summary>
