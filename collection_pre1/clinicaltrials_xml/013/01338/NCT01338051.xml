	<brief_title>The Development `` Mother/Child , Screen , Treat Vaccinate Program '' Manchay Iquitos , Peru</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our research group recently demonstrate self-collected cervico-vaginal sample test high throughput HR-HPV assay sensitive direct endocervical physician collect sample . Teamed non-liquid transport medium investigator believe technology solve reach large population short period time . With majority world 's medically underserved living middle income country necessary think simple small reach Earth 's needy . The investigator think high tech high throughput . The massive volume possible , proper organization , control per/patient cost . The investigator think `` event '' , continuous care . Clearly continuous care way adequately provide need care many problem . However , many intervention confine event organize large screen vaccination day positives identified detection algorithm healthcare staff become involved management . The investigator spend enormous amount resource identify majority people ultimately test negative . The local paradigm involve community design program , great participation lose follow-up segment shrink . This mother , child , screen , treat vaccinate program use cervical cancer prevention target preventive healthcare intervention . Using community base research orientation project begin 3 day education program collaborative meeting woman leader community ( promotoras ) . Collectively investigator develop model community advertise , educate , recruit , register , self-collect specimen , deliver sample , report result . In addition logistics 3 vaccination schedule female child organize . The medical staff involve management positive vaccine administration . The observational measure focus assess effectively step accomplish .</detailed_description>
