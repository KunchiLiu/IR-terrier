	<brief_summary>The small bowel biopsy cornerstone diagnosis celiac disease . In addition gold standard initial diagnosis celiac disease , periodic biopsy also recommend ongoing basis life-long disease . However , biopsy evaluation invasive expensive . Therefore , need simple , non-invasive test perform celiac patient subclinical disease . The present study base hypothesis expression activity cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 small intestinal mucosa sensitive measure enteropathy . Therefore small intestinal CYP3A4 activity markedly different celiac disease patient active disease compare patient remission . Small intestinal CYP3A4 activity measure three way : ( ) Cmax oral simvastatin , widely use drug predominantly metabolize small intestinal CYP3A4 ; ( ii ) AUC oral simvastatin ; ( iii ) Measurement CYP3A4 activity two small bowel biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study base hypothesis expression activity cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 small intestinal mucosa sensitive measure enteropathy . Therefore small intestinal CYP3A4 activity markedly different celiac disease patient active disease compare patient remission . Small intestinal CYP3A4 activity measure three way : ( iv ) Cmax oral simvastatin , widely use medication predominantly metabolize small intestinal CYP3A4 ; ( v ) AUC oral simvastatin ; ( vi ) Measurement CYP3A4 activity two small bowel biopsy . Objectives Primary Objectives - To test hypothesis positive correlation exist villus height : crypt depth ( Vh : Cd ) ratio specific activity CYP3A4 small intestinal biopsy sample derive subject celiac disease . - To test hypothesis inverse correlation exist small intestinal villus height : crypt depth ( Vh : Cd ) ratio maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) simvastatin ( 20 mg , orally dosed fasting ) subject celiac disease Secondary Objectives : - To test hypothesis inverse correlation exist small intestinal villus height : crypt depth ( Vh : Cd ) ratio serum area-under-the-curve ( AUC ) simvastatin ( 20 mg , orally dosed fasting ) subject celiac disease - To test hypothesis positive correlation exist small intestinal villus height : crypt depth ( Vh : Cd ) ratio relative expression level CYP3A4 protein subject celiac disease . - To test hypothesis inverse correlation exist small intestinal villus height : crypt depth ( Vh : Cd ) ratio concentration simvastatin ( 20 mg , orally dosed fast ) 6-hour urine collection subject celiac disease . - To test hypothesis positive correlation exist villus height : crypt depth ( Vh : Cd ) ratio specific activity CYP3A4 small intestinal biopsy sample derive subject celiac disease follow gluten-free diet &gt; 1 year . - To test hypothesis inverse correlation exist small intestinal villus height : crypt depth ( Vh : Cd ) ratio maximum serum concentration ( Cmax ) simvastatin ( 20 mg , orally dosed fasting ) subject celiac disease follow gluten-free diet &gt; 1 year . - To test hypothesis inverse correlation exist small intestinal villus height : crypt depth ( Vh : Cd ) ratio serum area-under-the-curve ( AUC ) simvastatin ( 20 mg , orally dosed fasting ) subject celiac disease follow gluten-free diet &gt; 1 year . - To test hypothesis positive correlation exist serum anti-transglutaminase antibody level specific activity CYP3A4 small intestinal biopsy sample derive subject celiac disease . - To test hypothesis positive correlation exist average daily consumption dietary gluten specific activity CYP3A4 small intestinal biopsy sample derive subject celiac disease .</detailed_description>
