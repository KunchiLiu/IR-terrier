	<brief_summary>The purpose double-blind , randomize clinical trial compare outcomes single-bundle ( SB ) anatomic double-bundle ( DB ) ACL reconstruction . We hypothesize anatomically reconstruct bundle ACL lead good restoration healthy knee mechanic clinical outcome . In addition standard clinical outcome measure , utilize unique combination high-speed biplane radiography ( highly accurate assessment knee kinematics ) 3D imaging ( MRI CT , define joint cartilage morphology ) characterize joint kinematics cartilage surface interaction functional task . The specific aim study : Specific Aim 1 : Determine anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction restore normal dynamic knee function well single-bundle ACL reconstruction . Hypothesis 1.1 Knee kinematics anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction similar uninjured contra-lateral limb single-bundle ACL reconstruction , measure dynamic stereoradiography 6 24 month surgery . Hypothesis 1.2 Graft elongation 6 24 month surgery reduce anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction comparison single-bundle ACL reconstruction , measure dynamic stereoradiography . Specific Aim 2 : Determine anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction result well clinical outcome single-bundle ACL reconstruction . Hypothesis 2.1 Anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction result symmetrical laxity well range motion hop test score comparison single-bundle ACL reconstruction . Hypothesis 2.2 In comparison single-bundle ACL reconstruction , anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction result well patient-oriented outcome , indicate few symptom , high level activity complete return sport . Successful completion aim provide quantitative evidence efficacy anatomic double-bundle ACL reconstruction restore normal knee mechanic . Should result show clear benefit procedure , would provide support wide adaptation anatomic DB reconstruction . By complete propose aim , also establish sound basis additional study longer follow-up ( include subject cohort ) , assess benefit anatomic DB ACL reconstruction improve long-term clinical outcome maintain joint cartilage health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction 6th common orthopaedic procedure . Disruption ACL lead alter knee function significantly increase risk osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Current method reconstruct ACL generally perceive successful ; however , several recent meta-analyses indicate normal structure function knee restore 60 % 70 % time 60 90 % radiographic evidence knee OA within 10 20 year . Though cause post-traumatic OA almost certainly multifactorial , significant factor contribute increase risk OA follow ACL injury surgery may failure restore normal anatomy kinematics knee . We previously show conventional single-bundle ( SB ) ACL reconstruction fail restore normal knee kinematics , lead alter pattern joint loading . There grow support theory cartilage adapt local load environment abnormal joint loading may play important role development progression OA . Our understanding ACL anatomy also improve last year , reveal shortcoming current surgical technique restore anatomy ACL . We develop double-bundle ( DB ) surgical procedure restore normal anatomy anteromedial ( AM ) posterolateral ( PL ) bundle ACL . The underlying principle approach anatomical graft placement lead well knee mechanic , necessary improve long-term outcome . To determine anatomic DB ACL reconstruction effectively restore normal dynamic knee function , conduct double-blind randomized clinical trial compare SB vs. anatomic DB ACL reconstruction . The specific aim study determine DB good SB ACL reconstruction term 1 ) dynamic knee function 2 ) clinical outcome . We randomly assign 160 subject isolated ACL injury SB DB ACL reconstruction follow subject 2 year . We utilize unique combination high-speed biplane radiography ( accurate assessment knee kinematics ) 3D imaging ( MRI CT , define joint cartilage morphology ) characterize joint kinematics cartilage surface interaction functional task . Clinical outcome include laxity , range motion , functional strength patient-reported symptom , function activity . Successful completion study provide evidence efficacy anatomic DB ACL reconstruction restore normal knee mechanic improve clinical outcome . If result show clear benefit procedure , sound basis establish future study assess benefit anatomic DB ACL reconstruction long-term clinical outcome joint health .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria subject include study : Are 14 50 year age ; Are schedule ACL reconstruction within 1 year injury ; Participate great 100 hour per year Level I ( e.g . football , basketball soccer ) Level II ( e.g . racquet sport , skiing , manual labour occupation ) activity ; Have injury bundle ACL ; Have tibial femoral insertion sit measure 14 18 mm diameter , confirm time surgery ; Have femoral notch great equal 12 mm width measure arthroscopic ruler time surgery Are willing continue participation study return schedule followup visit , even he/she move region . Exclusion Criteria Subjects exclude participation study : Had prior surgery involved knee ; Had prior currently injury surgery contralateral knee ; Have open femoral tibial growth plate evidence preoperative standard care radiograph ; Have great grade I concomitant ligament injury ; Have Outerbridge grade 3 4 full thickness articular cartilage injury ; Have evidence preoperative clinical MRI insertional intratendinous degeneration quadriceps tendon ; Have quadriceps tendon less 7 mm thick sagittal cut preoperative clinical MRI ; Have inflammatory form arthritis ; Have injury condition involve low extremity affect subject ' ability walk participate Level I II activity . Because participation study require subject undergo researchrelated MRI , subject also exclude : Had prior surgery aneurysm ; Had surgery within past two month ; Have cardiac pacemaker ; Have metal fragment eye , brain spinal cord ; Have surgical implant ; Have history claustrophobia Have history tolerate previous MRI scan without medication . Women pregnant time study enrollment plan become pregnant within 2 year followup period eligible participation study . If female become pregnant course followup , kinematic testing , would expose fetus radiation would suspend pregnancy complete .</criteria>
