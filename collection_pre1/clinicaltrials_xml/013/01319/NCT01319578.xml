	<brief_title>PD Study Assess Phosphate Binding Characteristics K2CG Chewing Gum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study demonstrate salivary phosphate level elevate patient CKD direct linear correlation serum phosphorus salivary phosphorus . K2CG chew gum may provide alternative approach treat patient elevate phosphate level . However , data regard pharmacodynamic effect K2CG chew gum salivary phosphorus lacking ; , study seek examine phosphate bind characteristic K2CG chew gum 2 different amount chitosan vary exposure time fast feed condition . A precise knowledge pharmacodynamic effect K2CG chew gum salivary phosphorus expect provide information necessary plan conduct subsequent interventional trial K2CG chew gum patient Chronic Kidney Disease ESRD . Specifically , quantification amount salivary phosphorus bind 3 formulation chitosan loaded chewing gum ( 20 mg , 40 mg 60 mg ) varying exposure time inform optimal duration exposure relative gum size . The effect gum size explore via use two different size placebo chew gum ( 1.7 g 2.0 g size ) . Additionally specific aim study ass whether chew gum fast vs. feed state affect bind characteristic chitosan load chew gum . This study pharmacodynamic study characterize phosphate binding capability three different dos K2CG chew gum ( 20mg , 40mg , 60mg ) one placebo chew gum ( 1.7 g ) . Thirty-six subject enrol across three renal function group base estimate glomerular filtration rate . Study assessment occur four study visit day ( Visit 2 , Visit 3 , Visit 4 , Visit 5 ) . Fasting study procedure occur morning visit day , non-fasting procedure occur follow administration standardize meal day . All subject receive three dos K2CG chew gum one placebo : 20 mg dose Visit 2 , 1.7 g placebo Visit 3 , 40 mg dose Visit 4 , 60 mg dose Visit 5 . Subjects aware specific gum dose size study visit ( single blind ) . The duration gum chew time salivary collection vary within group . Saliva collect specified time point throughout trial . Fasting salivary phosphorus must collect nothing eat drink least 2 hour .</detailed_description>
