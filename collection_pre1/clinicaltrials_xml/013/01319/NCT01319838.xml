	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma cancer nervous system account 15 % cancer relate death child . With advancement treatment therapy , long term survival rate progress approximately 50 % . The therapy use treatment , however , toxic associate serious long-term side effect . Treatment neuroblastoma typically include chemotherapy , surgery , stem cell transplantation , radiation therapy , immunotherapy . At end treatment , child neuroblastoma commonly take drug isotretinoin 6 month . Isotretinoin maintain response previous treatment help turn remain cancer cell normal nerve cell . Most patient often respond treatment first high-risk cancer come back . The majority child relapse treatment develop recurrent disease first two year follow completion therapy current treatment cure relapse . This study explore whether extend therapy isotretinoin 6 month 24 month help prevent cancer come back without cause severe side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Neuroblastoma common extracranial solid tumor childhood account 15 % pediatric cancer relate death . The majority patient present high-risk disease widely metastatic aggressive . Historically , less 30 % patient achieve long-term disease-free survival majority relapse occur within first 24 month follow treatment . Survival rate modestly improve addition high-dose chemotherapy stem cell rescue , radiotherapy , surgery biologic therapy , yet 50 % patient still succumb disease . Current treatment neuroblastoma also carry significant acute toxicity patient cure suffer significant long-term treatment-related morbidity . Therefore , child high-risk neuroblastoma need novel therapeutic strategy improve cure rate without add acute long-term toxicity . Retinoids , derivatives vitamin A , repeatedly show arrest cell growth neuroblastoma cell vitro cause differentiation . Clinical trial relapse neuroblastoma patient bulky tumor fail show significant response retinoid therapy . Subsequently , however , sentinel randomize clinical trial demonstrate isotretinoin ( 13-cis-retinoic acid ) , give patient minimal residual disease follow consolidation chemotherapy , independently improve overall survival patient high-risk neuroblastoma . The treatment regimen include isotretinoin 2 week follow 2 week rest period 6 treatment cycle . The treatment well tolerate minimal side effect . The duration treatment , 6 month , arbitrarily choose currently many institution implement prolong retinoic acid treatment patient relapse high-risk disease , yet formal study do statistically show improved survival prolong biotherapy . To improve progression-free survival patient high-risk neuroblastoma trial prolong therapy isotretinoin 24 month , time window relapse occur . The treatment anticipate well tolerated increase adverse side effect base benign side effect profile patient receive typical 6 month treatment course . The trial consist single arm 20 high-risk neuroblastoma patient receive total 24 cycle isotretinoin ( 2 week treatment follow 2 week rest ) compare historical current COG study treatment 6 cycle . Patients accrued 3-year period . The toxicity tolerability prolong course isotretinoin biologic therapy closely monitored focus neuropsychologic bone toxicity , isotretinoin drug level measure determine correlation level anti-tumor efficacy toxicity . This provide complementary data support future national cooperative group trial .</detailed_description>
