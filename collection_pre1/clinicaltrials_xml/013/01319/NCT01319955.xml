	<brief_summary>Pneumonia lead cause child death worldwide . Data Bangladesh indicate influenza substantial association pneumonia among child le two year old . This study use commercially available trivalent inactivate vaccine ( kill vaccine ) see prevent early childhood pneumonia among child le two year old . The study vaccinate child across three season ( 3 year ) , look effect attack rate pneumonia , well effect laboratory-confirmed influenza . It also look effect laboratory-confirmed influenza illness among non-vaccinated household contact age child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pneumonia primary cause child mortality worldwide . The global community consider intervention reduce pneumonia burden , include vaccine . Most attention focus bacterial vaccine . Influenza vaccine receive attention due lack influenza burden data high pneumonia endemic setting , poor understand influenza contributes , independently pathogens , childhood pneumonia burden . Data Bangladesh indicate influenza high incidence 10 % per year among child &lt; 5 year , among child get influenza infection , 28 % develop pneumonia , include severe pneumonia . Influenza-infected child develop pneumonia significantly young ( &lt; 2y ) . Due high influenza incidence , high proportion influenza-infected child develop pneumonia , influenza major contributor childhood pneumonia , Bangladesh , likely throughout pneumonia endemic tropical sub-tropical belt . Although trial conduct examine influenza vaccine impact influenza , none conduct specifically determine effect childhood pneumonia , particularly among &lt; 2 year high pneumonia risk . We propose conduct trial . The project goal determine whether influenza vaccine ( trivalent inactivate vaccine TIV ) reduce childhood pneumonia burden include : influenza-associated , aetiology-mediated , overall pneumonia incidence . The specific objective determine influenza vaccine efficacy 1 ) early childhood pneumonia ( child &lt; 2 year ) , 2 ) laboratory-confirmed influenza 3 ) rate influenza-specific complication include severe disease , hospitalisation , otitis medium . Secondary objective include determine effect influenza vaccine household transmission associate complication among age group , effect proven non-influenza viral bacterial invasive disease , occurrence adverse event associate vaccine , measure immune responsiveness influenza vaccine young child . Critical milestone include comparison vaccinate vaccine-controlled child 1 ) pneumonia incidence ( vaccine efficacy pneumonia ) , 2 ) influenza incidence ( vaccine efficacy influenza ) 3 ) rate clinical syndrome ( vaccine efficacy childhood morbidity ) . Milestones related secondary objective include comparison vaccinate vaccine-controlled child 1 ) rate laboratory-confirmed infection clinical illness among household contact 2 ) rate invasive bacterial viral disease , 3 ) rate adverse event . We also measure childhood immune responsiveness influenza vaccine relate observe rate infection clinical illness .</detailed_description>
