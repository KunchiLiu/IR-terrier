	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIM To determine rate thromboembolic complication ( include death attribute thromboembolic disease ) pregnant patient suspect deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) anticoagulation therapy withhold basis negative whole-leg compression ultrasound examination ( whole-leg CUS ) . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE The diagnosis deep vein thrombosis leg challenge due great variability clinical presentation lack sensitivity noninvasive test . This particularly true pregnant patient , exclude major study diagnostic strategy DVT . Ironically , pregnancy consider major risk factor DVT , make evidence-based diagnosis patient group particularly important . A study perform LDS Hospital , find single , whole-leg compression ultrasound could safely exclude diagnosis suspect , symptomatic , first-episode deep vein thrombosis leg . A subsequent metanalysis study technique confirm finding , observed utility strategy pregnant patient require study , 57 4,500 subject pool metanalysis pregnant . Therefore , good information regard performance diagnostic testing suspect DVT pregnant patient need . If whole-leg compression ultrasound prove adequately sensitive patient group , significant step simplify diagnostic process deep vein thrombosis , confirm diagnostic strategy commonly use presently physicians Intermountain Medical Center . EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS Design Prospective clinical cohort study ( `` management study '' ) . Patients 268 sequentially-enrolled pregnant patient evaluate suspected symptomatic deep vein thrombosis leg , report Intermountain Medical Center Peripheral Vascular Laboratory . Vascular technician pre-screen patient study entry simple questionnaire . Those meet screen criterion interview study coordinator verify meet inclusion criterion , reason exclusion , provide informed consent . Demographic medical history information : Clinical information relevant study obtain Study Coordinator follow informed consent initial study interview . Query Intermountain Healthcare electronic medical record also perform entry . Relevant information include standardized Case Report Form . Informed Consent document , Case Report Forms relevant source document electronic medical record obtain , place study binder store accord policy Institutional Review Board . Measurements : A research clinician perform brief clinical assessment , include adequate information calculate LeFT clinical prediction score , evaluate prior study . Patients proceed performance whole-leg compression ultrasound . Objective Testing Venous Thrombosis Whole-leg CUS perform patient . A standardized technique use CDU examination , identical protocol use clinically Intermountain Medical Center Peripheral Vascular Laboratory . Compressibility vein assess . The result categorize normal imaged venous segment fully compressible , abnormal noncompressible segment identify , inadequate interpretation . If vascular technologist develop suspicion isolate iliac DVT ( base absence phasic respiratory flow complete absence flow common femoral vein Doppler , normal compression ) refer physician principal investigator contact immediately telephone . Further evaluation ( usually alternate image modality ) order discretion refer physician accord best clinical judgment . Interpretation perform experienced vascular surgery staff accord protocol currently use Intermountain Medical Center . Findings redact specific data field interpret surgeon accord form generate purpose , enter onto Case Report Form . Interobserver variability limit use priori criterion positive negative study . Interobserver agreement technique find high prior study . If result initial whole-leg CUS normal ( DVT identify ) , anticoagulation withheld , regardless symptom . If result test abnormal ( DVT identify ) , patient refer treat clinician usual management discretion clinician . This group follow study outcome . Subjects whose result classify inadequate interpretation reason log exclude analysis . They receive management accord discretion treat physician . Long-Term Follow-up Patients negative whole-leg CUS undergo three month clinical follow-up , strategy use many diagnostic trial DVT.2 Patients instruct return immediately emergency department symptom sign DVT pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . A study clinician assess 3 month telephone interview use standardized questionnaire . If patient contact study team symptom suspicious DVT PE , evaluate study clinician Thrombosis Clinic ( symptom DVT ) , refer emergent care evaluation ( symptoms PE ) . Participants ' treating clinician also free obtain medically appropriate diagnostic testing suspect DVT PE follow-up period . A letter send refer physician explain protocol emphasize appropriate diagnostic testing suspect DVT PE may perform clinically indicate . At follow-up assessment , interval history take emphasis specific symptom ( include leg pain , tenderness swelling , chest pain , dyspnea , hemoptysis , syncope ) , hospitalization , interval evaluation DVT PE use anticoagulant . For patient die , cause death determine autopsy independent clinical review autopsy obtain . If follow-up patient identifies symptoms suspicious DVT PE previously clinically evaluate , schedule in-person evaluation physician Intermountain Medical Center Thrombosis Clinic . In addition information obtain patient follow-up visit , comprehensive review patient 's Intermountain electronic health record perform look evidence diagnostic test deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism use anticoagulant medication . Additionally , study coordinator presently receive alert positive diagnostic test DVT PE perform facility daily . This list review study participant . Results follow-up assessment enter Case Report Form study staff . This form add study binder study coordinator information append database data entry clerk . The study design estimate event rate thromboembolic disease death attributable thromboembolic disease normal cohort three-month follow-up period . An exact 95 % confidence interval excludes rate VTE 3 % great define clinically acceptable , accordance previous trial DVT diagnosis . The study report analysis outcomes per-protocol intention-to-treat basis event protocol violation ( i.e . receipt therapeutic anticoagulation despite negative whole-leg ultrasound , without objective evidence thrombotic complication ) . In event withdrawal participation , affected subject suppress analysis ( i.e . analysis perform per protocol basis ) , event isolate iliac DVT diagnose follow vascular technologist suspicion . Isolated iliac DVT diagnose additional imaging result technologist suspicion analyze additional outcome variable , rate diagnosis report corresponding exact 95 % confidence interval . Use intention-to-treat analysis could bias result study case withdrawn subject would , definition , complete define follow-up period would ascertainment primary study outcome . Adjudication Outcomes A panel three independent physician establish expertise venous thromboembolism name adjudicate suspect event DVT PE , diagnostic test occur follow-up period . Simple majority resolve dispute . All death adjudicate whether attributable PE another cause group adjudicator . Methodological Issues Avoidance Bias Entering consecutive patient study avoid selection bias . To avoid bias initial test period , establish pre-defined criterion negative positive study . Further diagnostic test patient negative result undertaken unless dictate new progressive symptom . Patients negative whole-leg CUS treat therapy give patient positive result . Diagnostic suspicion bias avoid objectively test patient return follow-up symptom sign suggestive deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism . Interpretation bias avoid obtain independent interpretation follow-up testing patient suspect disease independent adjudicator . The adjudicator blind result initial ultrasound cohort patient belongs . All death independently review . The adjudicator blind cohort patient belongs . Patient confidentiality maintain keep patient identity log separate database , use unique numerical identifier . Complete data track assure comparison enrollment log database independent reviewer . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Descriptive statistic age , weight , height , trimester ( week gestation ) , symptoms presentation ( pain , tenderness , duration symptom ) , clinical condition ( recent surgery , recent hospitalization , cancer , congestive heart failure , recent immobilization , cellulitis , superficial phlebitis family history thromboembolic disease ) LeFT variable ( include leg circumference ) calculate characterize study population . The event rate thromboembolic complication death thromboembolic disease calculate patient negative whole-leg CUS ; per-protocol intention-to-treat . The rate isolate iliac DVT detect vascular technologist suspicion report separate calculation correspond exct 95 % confidence interval A two-sided confidence interval event rate ( objectively verify venous thromboembolism ) calculate observation cohort exact method . If confidence interval exclude commonly accept threshold event rate 3 % , conclude diagnostic strategy clinically valid . We also describe clinical characteristic clot ( e.g . venous distribution ) endpoints data available . The sample size 268 patient meet eligibility criterion choose exact 95 % confidence interval would exclude event rate venous thromboembolism observation cohort 3 % . Excluding event rate 3 % commonly accept standard diagnostic strategy deem clinically acceptable .</detailed_description>
