	<brief_title>MK2206 Treating Patients With Stage I , Stage II , Stage III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess decrease phosphorylated ( phospho ) -protein kinase B ( Akt ) ( Ser^473 ) level tissue pre-surgical trial weekly MK2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) ( 2 dos ) patient operable invasive breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect MK2206 immunohistochemical expression phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /AKT pathway biomarkers pre-and post-MK2206 tumor tissue , phospho-S6 kinase . II . To assess modulation PI3K/AKT signal follow MK2206 use reverse-phase protein microarray analysis . III . To explore whether phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) mutation demonstrate different modulation PI3K/Akt-pathway signaling compare tumor loss phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) . IV . To explore whether MK2206 alters PI3K/Akt pathway signal differently hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER ) 2-negative tumor , compare triple-negative HER2-positive breast cancer . V. To evaluate whether tumor proliferation , measure Ki-67 stain breast tumor cell , reduce patient take MK2206 pre-surgically correlate Ki-67 modulation change PI3K/AKT signal . VI . To determine safety tolerability MK2206 patient early-stage breast cancer . VII . To collect fast blood evaluation predictive marker drug effect , marker insulin growth-factor receptor pathway ( i.e. , fast insulin , c-peptide , insulin-like growth factor [ IGF ] -1 , IGF bind protein [ BP ] -1 3 ) , well modulation phospho-markers peripheral blood mononuclear cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) day -9 -2 , undergo segmental resection total mastectomy day 0 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
