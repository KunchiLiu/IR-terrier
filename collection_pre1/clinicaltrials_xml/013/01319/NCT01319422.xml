	<detailed_description>Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) common hematologic malignancy characterize clonal expansion transform plasma cell ( PCs ) bone marrow1 . Over past decade , introduction immunomodulatory agent ( thalidomide lenalidomide ) proteasome inhibitor ( bortezomib ) effective therapy alter therapeutic landscape multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Following approval establishment thalidomide-containing regimen , melphalan , prednisone thalidomide ( MPT ) Thal/Dex , standard first-line therapy newly diagnose MM ( NDMM ) , lenalidomide combination dexamethasone ( RD ) approve treatment patient previously treat multiple myeloma 1 ( MM1 ) . However , even newly approve agent , MM remain incurable disease patient eventually relapse progress multiple line different therapeutic regimen include lenalidomide well bortezomib . Thus remain continued need identify new agent maintain long term disease control patient . Thalidomide immune-modulatory analogue lenalidomide clinical activity myeloma . Pomalidomide , thalidomide analogue , immunomodulatory agent display similar anti-angiogenic activity , far great anti-proliferative immunomodulatory activity , compare parent drug . Pomalidomide lenalidomide show posse similar pharmacological property vitro , include anti-angiogenic , immunomodulatory anti-proliferative property . However unifying molecular mechanism diverse effect elusive . Pomalidomide lenalidomide significantly great capacity enhance costimulation , lead enhanced activation innate adaptive immune cell compare Thalidomide . Recent study yield surprising finding agent mediate rapid biologic effect human monocyte T cell culture lead activation ra homolog gene family , member A ( RhoA ) GTPases , enhance actin polymerization . Changes actin cytoskeleton may also contribute capacity drug enhance formation immune synapsis , Pomalidomide also show stimulate antibody-dependent cytotoxic T-cell activity ( ADCC ) preclinical model . At tolerated dos ( MTD = 2 mg per day ( QD ) 5 mg every day ( QOD ) , pomalidomide show active subject relapse refractory multiple myeloma ( study CC-4047-00-001 ) . In 45 subject receive dos pomalidomide range , cohort , 10 mg daily , commonly occur dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) reversible neutropenia . As immunomodulatory drug ( IMiDs ) administer subject receive concomitant systemic steroid , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) see ( 1 subject study subsequent name patient supply rollover program ) . Recently , preliminary efficacy safety data ongoing phase II study , lead Martha Lacy Mayo Clinic , publish . Sixty patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma enrol . Pomalidomide ( CC-4047 ) give orally dose 2 mg daily day 1-28 28-day cycle dexamethasone give orally dose 40 mg daily day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle . Patient also receive aspirin 325 mg daily thromboprophylaxis . The study endpoint response rate patient take pomalidomide plus dexamethasone include patient lenalidomide resistant refractory multiple myeloma , safety pomalidomide plus dexamethasone . Responses record use criterion International Myeloma Working Group . Thirty eight patient achieve objective response ( 63 % ) include complete response ( CR ) 3 patient ( 5 % ) , good partial response ( VGPR ) 17 patient ( 28 % ) , partial response ( PR ) 18 patient ( 30 % ) . The CR + VGPR rate 33 % . Grade 3 4 hematologic toxicity occur 23 patient ( 38 % ) consist anemia three patient ( 5 % ) , thrombocytopenia two patient ( 3 % ) neutropenia 21 ( 35 % ) . Among developed grade 3/4 neutropenia , first experience neutropenia cycle 1-3 ; new patient experience grade 3/4 neutropenia cycle 4 later . The common non-hematological grade 3/4 toxicity fatigue ( 17 % ) pneumonia ( 8 % ) . Other grade 3/4 non-hematological toxicity occur less 5 % include diarrhea , constipation , hyperglycemia , neuropathy . One patient ( 1.6 % ) thromboembolic event deep vein thrombosis . Another dose regimen Pomalidomide involve 21/28 day dosing , current dose regimen Lenalidomide . In trial recommend dose phase II testing determine 4 mg , 21/28 d. Clinical response ( great equal partial response ( PR ) ) observe 7/25 ( 28 % ) patient . While regimen seem clinically active , unclear present regimen lead great immune activation clinical activity . In addition MM , pre-clinical data prior experience thalidomide lenalidomide treatment patient myelofibrosis myeloid metaplasia ( MMM ) provide rationale use pomalidomide patient MMM . This support result Celgene sponsor trial ( MMM-001 ) indicate pomalidomide therapy 0.5 mg 2 mg/day +/- abbreviated course prednisone well tolerated patient myelofibrosis active treatment anemia . However , study monitor proximate pharmacodynamic event ( might occur within hour drug exposure ) , link downstream effect , include clinical activity toxicity . Our hypothesis proximate effect drug ( include drug induce change F-actin ) early phosphorylation event sensitive quantitative surrogate subsequent effect include activation tumor antigen specific T cell well innate immune cell . Understanding correlation pharmacodynamics effect downstream activation use quantitative assay facilitate rational development agent immunomodulatory drug diverse setting may also allow optimization drug delivery reduce potential toxicity , enhance efficacy .</detailed_description>
