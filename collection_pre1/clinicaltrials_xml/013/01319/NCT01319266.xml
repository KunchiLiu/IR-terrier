	<brief_title>A Study Assess Pharmacokinetics Hydrocodone Extended-Release Tablet ( CEP-33237 ) Subjects With Normal Renal Function Subjects With Varying Degrees Renal Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , parallel-group pharmacokinetic safety study assess effect vary degree renal impairment ( mild , moderate , severe end stage renal disease [ ESRD ] ) pharmacokinetics hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablet single dose 45 mg compare subject normal renal function . The study consist screen visit within 28 day study drug administration ( visit 1 ) , follow single-dose administration period include 144-hour pharmacokinetic sampling period ( visit 2 ) final assessment final pharmacokinetic sample collect upon early withdrawal , follow-up visit 48 72 hour last discharge study center ( visit 3 ) . Subjects categorized either control group normal renal function one four group subject vary degree renal impairment . Up 12 subject 4 renal impairment group 16 subject normal renal function enrol achieve target minimum 8 subject renal impairment group 10 subject normal renal function complete study . Eligible subject check study center day -1 . Subjects continue meet criterion enrollment receive single dose hydrocodone bitartrate extended-release tablet day 1 . Subjects receive one 50-mg tablet naltrexone hydrochloride block opioid receptor minimize opioid related adverse event approximately 15 3 hour approximately 9 21 hour study drug administration . Blood urine sample collect study drug administration 144-hour period study drug administration . Safety assess throughout study monitoring occurrence adverse event , clinical laboratory test result , vital sign measurements,12-lead ECG finding , physical examination finding , SpO2 finding , use concomitant medication . Subjects complete schedule visit final procedure assessment perform prior discharge study center pharmacokinetic sample complete . All subject ask return follow-up visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key All subject : Written inform consent obtain . The subject man woman least 18 year age , body mass index ( BMI ) 20 kg/m2 . Women must surgically sterile , 2 year postmenopausal , , childbearing potential , use medically accept method contraception , agree continue use method duration study 30 day discontinuation study drug . The subject nonsmoker smoke less 10 cigarette per day . The subject 's vitamin usage stable least 2 week study drug administration subject 's prescription overthecounter ( OTC ) medication dosage stable . The subject must willing able comply study restriction remain clinic require duration administration period study . Subjects normal renal function : The subject generally good health determine medical psychiatric history , physical examination , ECG , serum chemistry , hematology , urinalysis , serology . The subject estimate creatinine clearance &gt; 80 mL/min . Subjects renal impairment : Subjects may concurrent stable medical condition addition renal impairment may include investigator protocolspecified contact medical issue consider condition introduce additional risk factor , interfere study objective procedure ( e.g. , subject diabetes stable , essential hypertension ) . Subjects renally impaired define 1 follow category : subject ESRD must hemodialysis least 6 month prior enrollment receive standard incenter thrice weekly treatment subject severe renal impairment must estimate creatinine clearance le 30 mL/min subject moderate renal impairment must estimate creatinine clearance 3050 mL/min subject mild renal impairment must estimate creatinine clearance great 50 80 mL/min Key All subject : The subject poor metabolizer cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2D6 substrate base genotyping performed screening . The subject use inducer ( weak inducer ) CYP3A4/5 CYP2D6 within 28 day prior study drug administration . NOTES : Topical use medication know inducer CYP3A4/5 CYP2D6 may permit consultation medical monitor . No medication permit within 2 hour study drug administration . The subject use inhibitor ( weak inhibitor ) CYP3A4/5 CYP2D6 within 14 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior study drug administration . NOTES : Topical use medication know inhibitor CYP3A4/5 CYP2D6 may permit consultation medical monitor . No medication permit within 2 hour study drug administration . The subject pregnant lactate woman . ( Any woman become pregnant study withdrawn study . ) The subject disorder may interfere drug absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion ( include gastrointestinal surgery , exclude appendectomy ) . Note : Cholecystectomy perform 2 year prior enrollment permit . The subject previously participate study CEP33237 . The subject know sensitivity idiosyncratic reaction compound present hydrocodone hydromorphone , related compound , metabolite , naltrexone , compound list present study formulation . The subject unlikely comply study protocol , unsuitable reason , judge investigator . Subjects normal renal function : The subject clinically significant , uncontrolled medical condition ( treat untreated ) . The subject clinically significant deviation normal ECG physical examination finding , determine investigator protocolspecified contact medical issue . Subjects normal renal function hemoglobin value le 12 g/dL . Subjects renal impairment : The subject condition , opinion investigator protocolspecified contact medical issue , introduce additional risk factor interfere study objective procedure . The subject evidence unstable clinically important medical condition impair renal function . The subject acute exacerbation unstable renal function , indicate worsen clinical and/or laboratory sign renal impairment , within 4 week study drug administration . The subject acute renal disease cause infection drug toxicity .</criteria>
