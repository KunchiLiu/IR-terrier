	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Prevention Thrombocytopenia After First-line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , control , open-labeled , multicenter clinical trial . The subject patient NSCLC go receive GC/GP regimen chemotherapy . Vadhan-Raj et al conduct study administer rhTPO various way patient sarcoma receive platinum-containing chemotherapy . The result demonstrate timing administration rhTPO adjust accord occurrence time nadir platelet value induce chemotherapy . The timing administration rhTPO study determine base proof .</detailed_description>
