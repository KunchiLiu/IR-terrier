	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) degenerative condition affect macula central area retina elderly people . Early AMD mark presence soft drusen and/or retinal pigment abnormality ( hyper- hypopigmentation ) . Late AMD include 2 form , nonneovascular ( dry ) AMD neovascular ( wet ) AMD . Despite new medical surgical intervention , AMD remain leading cause vision loss elderly people world . Ranibizumab one effective approach AMD management . Ranibizumab — recombinant , humanize , monoclonal antibody Fab neutralize active form vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF A ) — evaluate treatment AMD . Ranibizumab bind receptor bind site active form VEGF-A . VEGF-A cause neovascularization leakage model ocular angiogenesis vascular occlusion , think contribute progression neovascular AMD macular edema follow RVO . Prevents interaction VEGF-A receptor ( VEGFR1 VEGFR2 ) surface endothelial cell , reduce endothelial cell proliferation , vascular leakage , new blood vessel formation . There number study examine possible association ranibizumab arterial thromboembolic event ( ATE ) . The ATE rate three control neovascular AMD study first year 1.9 % ( 17 874 ; 0.3-0.5 mg LUCENTIS ) vs 1.1 % ( 5 441 ) control arm ( AMD-1 , AMD-2 ) . In second year ATE rate 2.6 % ( 1323 patient ; Lucentis 879 ) v Control 444 ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . The ATE rate two control RVO study ( RVO-1 , RVO-2 ) first six month 0.8 % ( 789 patient ; Lucentis 527 v Sham 262 ) . The investigator assume ranibizumab rather dangerous patient history coronary artery disease cerebrovascular event . The main objective study reveal contraindication ranibizumab prescription patient history coronary artery disease cerebrovascular event . Moreover , association management ranibizumab ATE rate healthy 50 year old person concern great interest well .</detailed_description>
