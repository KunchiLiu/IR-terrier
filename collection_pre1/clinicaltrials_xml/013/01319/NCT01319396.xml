	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare accuracy BiancaMed BM07 breathe frequency indicator device respiration rate measure SomnoScreen RC Easy device 20+ human volunteer . This carry support 510 ( k ) submission . - The BM07 non-contact device , use radio frequency ( RF ) range measurement detect chest wall motion , thus respiration rate . The BM07 CE Class IIa clear device . - The SomnoScreen RC Easy CE FDA ( K060708 ) clear device , use overnight , portable sleep recorder . One input pair chest respiration effort band use record breathe rate subject . - The human volunteer select range age , body mass index ( BMI ) gender cover broad cross section population . BMI , gender age feature might affect performance RF reflect signal : - High BMI low BMI could affect skin RF reflectivity . - High BMI may mask chest wall movement breathing . - The thinner skin often associate increase age may affect RF reflectivity . - Female breast tissue may affect RF reflectivity mask chest wall movement . The target performance agreement BM07 Somnoscreen +/- 5 breath per minute . This target select base upon literature review , particular : - Lim et al : Respiratory Rate Measurement Adults - How Reliable ? - Droitcour PhD Thesis : Non-Contact Measurement Heart Respiration Rates Single-Chip Microwave Doppler Radar . There risk subject RF energy emit BM07 much less either mobile phone bluetooth domestic WLAN router . The test carry volunteer human subject , sign consent form . The location test Dublin , Ireland Belfast , UK . The test comprises subject sit still period 2 minute whilst recording take BM07 Somnoscreen . The test configuration range BM07 subject 0.5 , 1.0 &amp; 1.5m 1.0m thick fold duvet ( overblanket/comforter ) cover subject represent wear thick outdoor winter clothing . Each test configuration carry twice , make total 8 test recording per subject . The first 2 volunteer use confirm maximum effective range BM07 least 1.5 target aspect subject ( ie sensor front , one side behind ) affect ability BM07 detect breathe movement</detailed_description>
