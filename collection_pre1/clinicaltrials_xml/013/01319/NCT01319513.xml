	<brief_summary>Protein ingestion increase rate body build new protein skeletal muscle ( muscle protein synthesis . This study design examine pattern feed affect muscle protein synthesis follow resistance exercise . There reason believe large rapid increase blood amino acid concentration accompany ingestion bolus protein important increase muscle protein synthesis . Thus , hypothesize consumption bolus protein elevate muscle protein synthesis great extent consumption equivalent amount protein consume small divided dos .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The rapid appearance blood essential amino acid , leucine particular , may act important signal stimulate muscle protein synthesis resistance exercise . This may explain consume rapidly-absorbed whey protein may anabolic edge slowly-absorbed protein casein . Previous investigation importance rate absorption muscle protein synthesis use 'fast ' 'slow ' protein confound difference amino acid composition . The present study address issue administer protein source , whey , either bolus small divide 'pulse ' dos achieve divergent amino acid profile bout resistance exercise . This study conduct young ( 18-35 ) men . Our outcome measure include : blood amino acid concentration , rate myofibrillar protein synthesis , anabolic intracellular signalling marker</detailed_description>
