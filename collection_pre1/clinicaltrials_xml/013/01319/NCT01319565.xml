	<brief_summary>Background : - An experimental treatment metastatic melanoma involve cell therapy , researcher take white blood cell ( lymphocyte ) tumor tissue , grow laboratory large number , use cell attack tumor tissue . Before receive cell , chemotherapy need temporarily suppress immune system improve chance tumor-fighting cell able survive body . In study cell therapy , individual receive total body irradiation ( TBI ) addition chemotherapy ( order increase length time produce white blood cell ) seem slightly good response treatment , know add radiation cell therapy cause well response individual . Researchers interested compare cell therapy give usual chemotherapy cell therapy give usual chemotherapy TBI . Objectives : - To compare effectiveness cell therapy give chemotherapy cell therapy give chemotherapy total body irradiation individual metastatic melanoma . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose metastatic melanoma . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , tumor image study . - Participants divide two group : cell therapy chemotherapy alone ( group 1 ) cell therapy chemotherapy plus TBI ( group 2 ) . - All participant provide tumor sample either surgery tumor biopsy white blood cell collection . - Participants leukapheresis collect additional white blood cell cell growth future testing , TBI group participant also provide stem cell help recover radiation . ( TBI participant provide enough stem cell move non-radiation treatment group . ) - Participants chemotherapy cyclophosphamide ( two treatment 2 day ) fludarabine ( five treatment 5 day ) start 7 day cell therapy . Participants TBI group also TBI 3 day immediately cell therapy . - All participant receive white blood cell , follow high-dose aldesleukin every 8 hour 5 day cell infusion help keep therapy cell alive active . Participants also injection filgrastim stimulate blood cell production , participant TBI group also receive stem cell . - Participants take antibiotic least 6 month treatment prevent pneumonia , ask return regular monitoring followup visit least 5 year evaluate tumor response treatment ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Study Cell Therapy Metastatic Melanoma Using Short-Term Cultured Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Plus IL-2 Following Either Non-Myeloablative Lymphocyte Depleting Chemotherapy Regimen Alone Conjunction w/1200 TBI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Adoptive cell therapy ( ACT ) use autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte mediate regression bulky metastatic melanoma administer along high-dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine . - In series consecutive trial use chemotherapy preparative regimen alone 2 Gy 12 Gy total body irradiation ( TBI ) objective response rate use RECIST criterion 49 % , 52 % , 72 % , respectively . Complete regression rate three consecutive trial 12 % , 20 % , 40 % , respectively strongly suggest addition TBI could improve complete regression rate . Of 20 complete regression see trial , 19 on-going 37 82 month . - Because complexity develop select TIL use adoptive transfer , recently develop simplified method produce TIL applicable use outside institution . Utilizing young TIL cell ( sometimes CD8 purification ) 105 patient , objective response rate 34 % 6.6 % incidence complete regression . All patient trial receive cyclophosphamide fludarabine regimen alone . - Because strong suggestion addition TBI chemotherapy regimen could increase durable , complete regression rate patient metastatic melanoma , attempt definitively determine whether addition TBI chemotherapy preparative regimen improve complete response rate , overall survival patient receive young TIL . Objectives : - To determine , prospective randomize trial , complete response rate survival patient metastatic melanoma receive ACT use young TIL plus aldesleukin treatment follow either chemotherapy preparative regimen alone , chemotherapy preparative regimen plus TBI . - Response rate progression free survival evaluate secondary endpoint , toxicity two treatment regimen . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year old must : - Evaluable metastatic melanoma ; - Metastatic melanoma lesion suitable surgical resection preparation TIL ; - No contraindication high-dose aldesleukin administration total body irradiation ; - No concurrent major medical illness form immunodeficiency Design : -Patients metastatic melanoma lesion resect TIL growth establish patient prospectively randomize receive ACT young TIL plus aldesleukin follow either non-myeloablative chemotherapy preparative regimen regimen plus TBI .</detailed_description>

Total bilirubin less equal 2 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3 mg/dl . l. More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time randomization , patient toxicity must recover grade 1 less ( except alopecia vitiligo ) . Patients must stable progress disease prior treatment . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify inclusion criterion . m. Six week must elapse since prior antiCTLA4 antibody therapy allow antibody level decline .
