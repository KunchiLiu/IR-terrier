	<brief_summary>The objective study separately demonstrate safety efficacy BIOTRONIK 's Astron Pulsar stent . The Pulsar stent use treatment femoro-popliteal lesion , locate native superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) proximal popliteal artery ( PPA ) , Astron stent use treatment common external iliac artery lesion .</brief_summary>

Thigh brachial index ( TBI ) may use / performed ABI inadequate . Written inform consent For subject receive investigational stent , follow procedurerelated criterion must meet : One de novo , restenotic occlude lesion represent femoropopliteal iliac indication OR Two de novo , restenotic occlude lesion represent one femoropopliteal indication one iliac indication contralateral limb ( i.e . one lesion per limb ) Lesions may one solid lesion series multiple , small lesion treat one lesion Subjects bilateral , SFA/PPA disease ( i.e . one SFA/PPA lesion per limb ) eligible enrollment study . The target lesion select investigator 's discretion base study eligibility criterion . The contralateral SFA/PPA intervention may perform time index procedure ( prior treatment study lesion ) ; however , use investigational treatment prohibit . If contralateral SFA/PPA intervention perform time index procedure , intervention must perform least 30 day index procedure . The use investigational treatment contralateral intervention prohibit . Subjects bilateral , iliac disease ( i.e . one iliac lesion per limb ) eligible enrollment study . The target lesion select investigator 's discretion base study eligibility criterion . The contralateral iliac intervention may perform time index procedure ; however , use investigational treatment prohibit . If contralateral iliac intervention perform time index procedure , intervention must perform least 30 day index procedure . The use investigational treatment subsequent contralateral intervention also prohibit . Femoropopliteal lesion must locate least 1 cm distal profunda femoris artery least 3 cm knee joint ( radiographic joint space ) Iliac lesion must locate either common external iliac artery Lesions must treatable maximum two stent Angiographic evidence ≥ 70 % stenosis occlusion ( operator visual assessment ) Lesion length ≤ 190 mm ( de novo restenotic ) ≤ 100 mm ( occlude ) Target vessel reference diameter : 2.5 6 mm ( SFA/PPA ) 6 9 mm ( iliac artery ) visual estimate Angiographic evidence patent SFA PPA ( iliac indication ) angiographic evidence least one distal vessel runoff foot ( femoropopliteal iliac indication ) . Patent define &lt; 50 % stenosis . For SFA/PPA intervention , significant stenosis ( &gt; 70 % ) occlusion ipsilateral , inflow artery ( e.g . aortoiliac , common femoral ) must successfully treat ( use investigational treatment prohibit ) prior treatment target lesion . Successful treatment define complication less 30 % residual stenosis follow intervention . Exclusion Criteria To support objective study , follow initial exclusion criterion must present subject enrol : Subjects pregnant plan become pregnant course study Life expectancy less one year RutherfordBecker category 5 6 .
