	<detailed_description>Considering development gastric cancer surgery use da Vinci Robotic Surgical System , development educational program need achieve Korea institute . Moreover , large number gastrectomy include robotic surgery gastric cancer treatment , investigator provide high quality educational program use da Vinci System . Therefore , investigator want create innovative real-time training module , provide intraoperative step-by-step guide robotic surgical procedure . This technological project name Advanced Robotic Multi-display Educational System ( ARMES ) . The four-stages ARMES development follow : 1 . Standardization key step select procedure ; 2 . Preparation well edit short video clip previously determine step use extensive library video 350 high quality robotic gastrectomy ; 3 . Production 3D animation key surgical step ; 4 . Integration video segment da Vinci Robot system use TileproTM . Through predetermine standardized segment short operation video clip 3D animation , investigator develop versatile intra-operative on-screen audiovisual mentoring system use TileproTM program , improve surgeon ' capability perform complex robotic operation achieve quicker operation specific competency . It help surgeon initial state robotic surgery technical well oncological aspect cancer surgery detail step-by-step . Finally program apply robotic surgery progress standard education program .</detailed_description>
