	<brief_title>Combined Radiotherapy Sorafenib Patients With Hepatoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) common cause cancer mortality Asia . Most patient present intermediate advanced disease . Percutaneous ethanol injection , radiofrequency ablation , transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) consider curative treatment achieve limited success eradicate large HCC . With development new radiotherapy ( RT ) technique , RT safely give patient large tumor burden . Thus , TACE combine RT suggest treat large HCC . Based result study , RT could achieve tumor response rate 50 % 70 % . However , definitively show prolong overall disease-free survival due lack phase III clinical trial . In contrast , retrospective clinical investigation molecular study suggest sublethal dose RT promote HCC growth outside RT field . Two phase III trial show efficacious well-tolerated patient advance HCC . Median overall survival significantly 2 3 month longer sorafenib group placebo . It interesting recognize combine therapeutic effect RT sorafenib . Based several preclinical experiment , tumor angiogenesis inhibitor seem synergistic irradiation use RT , concurrently RT , RT . Thus , design single-arm phase II clinical trial investigate efficacy combine RT sorafenib . The eligibility criterion patient unresectable HCC ; good performance status ; prior radiotherapy liver ; clinical measurable tumor ; good liver function good compliance . After enter study , testee receive RT hepatic tumor concurrently sorafenib dose 400 mg twice daily . Hepatic RT perform daily fraction size 2.0 2.5 Gy total dose 46 Gy 60 Gy . After RT , maintenance sorafenib dose 400 mg twice daily ongoing . Sorafenib continue occurrence clinical radiologic progression , occurrence either unacceptable adverse event death . Minimum maintenance duration 6 month recommend , mandatory . The primary end point response rate toxicity profile . The secondary endpoint time radiological progression interval ( TRPI ) , overall survival , quality life assessment .</detailed_description>
