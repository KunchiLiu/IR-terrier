	<detailed_description>The 'SILVERMAN ' 1 Trial Single Incision Laparoscopic Versus Existing Resection ( Minimal Access ) Neoplasia- A Multi-institutional Randomised Controlled Trial Applicant : Professor Desmond C Winter , Institute Clinical Outcomes Research Education ( iCORE ) , St. Vincent 's University Hospital , Elm Park , Dublin 4 , Ireland . winterd @ indigo.ie Background Colonic cancer third commonest cause cancer mortality woman men develop world [ 1 ] . Old age , adenomatous colorectal polyp , inflammatory bowel disease , low intake dietary fibre family history colorectal cancer predispose development colonic cancer [ 2-4 ] . Certain genetic syndrome Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer ( HNPCC ) , Familial Adenomatous Polyposis ( FAP ) , Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome ( PJS ) Juvenile Polyposis significant lifetime risk develop colonic cancer [ 5-8 ] . Historically , open surgery mainstay treatment localise , potentially curable colonic cancer . Laterally , minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery largely supplant open surgery management colonic cancer [ 9,10,11 ] . Published data show laparoscopic assist resection equivalent oncological outcome term long term survival compare conventional open surgery . Similarly , Level 1 evidence major randomise control trial field suggest laparoscopic colonic resection confers advantage open approach perioperative period term reduce requirement parenteral narcotic oral analgesic , early restoration intestinal function , early ambulation , short hospital stay . To date remains consensus accept guideline surgical management potentially curable right colonic cancer . The NHS publish guideline management colorectal cancer simply state surgeon offer patient potentially curative laparoscopic resection appropriately trained specialist techniques12 . Currently , surgeon competent minimal access surgery favour laparoscopic right hemicolectomy technique choice right colonic resection . Intestinal continuity restore intracorporeally , extracorporeally exteriorise mobilise segment ileum/right transverse colon . The advent `` single incision laparoscopic surgery '' ( SILS ) advance minimally invasive approach management complex surgical disease . SILS , currently embryonic stage development , utilises single incision insert single access device abdominal cavity direct vision . Typically , device insert midline utilises 2-3cm incision around umbilicus , embryonic natural orifice . The optical operating trocars insert access device procedure carry conventional laparoscopic procedure . Many short case series report publish describe feasibility SILS performing complex surgical procedure benign malignant disease [ 13,14,15 ] . Specialised , complex colorectal procedure proctocolectomy ileal pouch-anal anastomosis ( IPAA ) , ileocolic resection terminal ileal Crohn 's mass colonic resection cancer successfully perform use single incision laparoscopic surgery [ 16,17,18,19 ] . To date , several short series SILS right hemicolectomy publish literature [ 20,21 ] .Thus , rather new novel technique , SILS derivation laparoscopic surgery , perform single incision . There evidence literature SILS colectomy confers disadvantage conventional laparoscopic surgery dtae , report SILS put patient increase risk complication . Postulated benefit SILS colectomy conventional laparoscopic colectomy include reduce number incision , improve cosmesis , less pain , fast return normal activities/work shorter hospital stay . Heretofore , randomise control clinical trial compare SILS standard laparoscopic right hemicolectomy cancer . Having previously demonstrate benefit laparoscopic resection open resection treatment colon cancer feel time ripe extrapolate data compare laparoscopic right hemicolectomy propose new treatment modality , single incision laparoscopic right hemicolectomy , format multicentre , international randomise controlled clinical trial . Knowledge transfer/implementation Current evidence regard optimal surgical approach potentially curable right colonic cancer base numerous , well design randomise control clinical trial . Currently , eminence base opinion suggest alternative surgical technique , SILS , may improve short long term outcome minimally invasive right colonic resection . A true , prospective analysis compare standard care ( laparoscopic right hemicolectomy ) `` new '' therapy ( SILS ) yet publish . Having establish optimum treatment modality minimally invasive approach right colonic tumor result communicate national international meeting . Findings submit international surgical journal ensure maximal communication result make available national international academic society enable establishment guideline best practice surgical management right colonic cancer . Objective To compare patient outcome follow standard care ( laparoscopic right hemicolectomy ) alternative , establish , recognize therapy ( SILS right hemicolectomy ) treatment right colonic tumor . Specific research question include : 1 . Which treatment modality confers least perioperative morbidity mortality surgical management right colonic tumor ? 2 . Does treatment influence length time discharge home return activity daily live ? 3 . Are treatment modality equivalent term extent resection ( lymph node yield , resection margin etc ) ? Strategy An Irish base , multi-centre , international trial perform aim compare two treatment modality patient present right colonic cancer . Pre-operative detail , intraoperative finding post-operative course prospectively accrue operate surgeon . Each surgeon previous experience perform procedure currently offer SILS colectomy patient outside clinical trial setting . All patient follow primary secondary end-points record . Primary End-points 1 . Qualitative - Lymph node yield - Histopathological grade specimen - Conversion rate - 30 day mortality - Cancer free survival Secondary Endpoints 2 . Quantitative- operative time - pain score ( visual analog scale ) - cosmesis satisfaction - earlymorbiditywound/respiratory /urosepsis , thromboembolic , cardiorespiratory , anastomotic leak , intra- abdominal abscess reoperation - Intravenous narcotic/ oral analgesic requirement - Resumption intestinal function/ diet - Duration discharge home - Return normal activity Study Design The study international multi-centred , randomize control trial . Ethical approval seek prior study implementation . Inclusion criteria 1 . Age 18-85 year 2 . Histologic confirmation right colonic cancer 3 . Informed consent Exclusion criterion 1 . Inability give inform consent ( e.g . dementia ) 2 . Previous midline laparotomy incision 3 . T4 tumour diagnose pre-operative image intra-operatively 4 . Previous pelvic irradiation 5 . FAP/ HNPCC 6 . Colonic carcinoma background ulcerative colitis . 7 . Emergent surgery perforated/obstructing right colonic cancer Study outline All patient histologically confirm right colonic tumour eligible study . Individual patient consent seek . Each patient randomize pre-operative visit day prior surgery ; thus , patient know , advance , procedure undergoing . Patients stag pre-operatively Computed Tomography abdomen pelvis facilitate therapeutic operative strategy . All patient give prophylaxis deep vein thrombosis ( sequential intermittent pneumatic compression devices/compression stocking low molecular weight heparin ) . A single , prophylactic dose antibiotic give perioperatively ; choice antibiotic determine accord institutional guideline . Operative procedure accord standard practice . At laparoscopic right hemicolectomy , pneumoperitoneum establish follow insertion 12mm umbilical port . Two 3 operating trocars ( 5mm ) insert ; number position operate surgeon discretion . When necessary use two 5mm trocars complete procedure record . Ligation vascular pedicle must perform intracorporeally use endovascular stapling device , endoclips electrothermal coagulation device . If major vessel ligate extracorporeally mobilise colon exteriorise resection procedure classify `` laparoscopic assist '' - i.e . convert open procedure- purpose trial . Intestinal continuity restore extracorporeally use end end , end-to side side-to side anastomosis . The type anastomosis surgeon ' discretion ( staple vs. handsewn ) record . Patients SILS right hemicolectomy receive perioperative care undergoing conventional laparoscopic resection . The SILS access device insert 4-5cm incision ( max 6cm incision ) , 2cm 1 cm umbilicus . The access device utilises three 5mm trocars facilitate entry peritoneal cavity . The choice access device individual surgeon ' discretion . In event additional port require complete SILS minimally invasive procedure number additional trocars use record . Oral fluid commence even surgery diet introduce follow morning , depend clinical status . Urinary catheter remove post-operative day 1 ambulation encourage . Data Collection Data collection perform operating surgeon , designate member surgical team ( present time operation ) Dr. Martin , Co-PI study , record electronic pro-forma submit on-line database ( iCore website- Institute Clinical Outcomes Research Education ) . Each patient enrol study give study number data register number . Patients thus deidentified . Any data could potentially identify patient D.O.B/ date surgery , date discharge exclude . It include patient demographic ( age , sex ) , American Society Anaesthesiologists ( ASA ) grade specific co-morbidities , intervention perform , operation perform , number port use , technique ligation vascular pedicle , type anastomosis , re-intervention index admission ( radiological operative ) in-hospital morbidity ( myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , wound infection , abscess require drainage , urosepsis , renal failure respiratory insufficiency ) , mortality , analgesic requirement , time return diet , time discharge home . Further detail record post-operative visit include number day alive follow discharge , reinterventions within 12 month patient satisfaction . Each patient see 3 12 month post-operatively . For patient state prefer follow locally perform telephone interview timeline outline . Patient satisfaction determine use Short Form ( SF-36 ) questionnaire 3 12 month . Sample Size The main short-term endpoint study qualitative ( lymph node yield , grade specimen ) quantitative ( operative time , cosmesis satisfaction , resumption normal diet/intestinal function , length hospital stay ) . Cancer-related survival main long-term primary end-point . The working hypothesis significant difference variable SILS conventional laparoscopic right hemicolectomy , difference variable related short-term outcome ( i.e . morbidity duration hospital stay ) would favour SILS . We assume difference cancer-related survival le 15 % treatment indicate equivalent efficacy . Assuming 70 % 5-year cancer-related survival laparoscopic colectomy group , minimum 100 patient per group require show surgical technique equivalent α level 0•20 β error 0•05 . Recruitment patient expect difficult evidence date convince least equivalent outcome believe patient would hope assigned SILS group , potentially short hospital stay , less pain improved cosmesis . From surgeon 's perspective , SILS technically feasible represent slight modification conventional laparoscopic procedure . Hospital Inclusion Patient Accrual All eligible patient ( see exclusion criterion ) present participate hospital right colonic tumor recruit trial . . Each patient randomize pre-operative visit day prior surgery ; thus , patient know , advance , procedure undergoing . Patients furnish patient information leaflet implication inclusion trial explain operating surgeon . It explain non-willingness participate trial negative impact treatment . If patient willing participate trial , verbal write consent obtain prior transfer operate theatre . Randomisation schedule block , propose treatment deliver write sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope . If inferiority efficacy demonstrable preliminary statistical analysis , trial stop prematurely prevent harm patient . We aim perform preliminary analysis pool data 6/12/18/24 month 100/150/200 patient entered trial ; whichever come first prompt preliminary analysis . Each adverse event include electronic file patient study . The data communicate PI site participate study . In event one technique great risk patient , lead center Dublin , Ireland terminate study prematurely . Similarly , event PI study unhappy outcome study , free withdraw trial time . This withdrawal report publishing data . Statistical Analysis Data assess accord intention-to-treat principle . Because scope study non-metastatic colon cancer , patient metastasis detect intra-operatively included analysis long-term outcome . Survival calculate surgical resection primary tumour last visit death . For cancer-related survival , patient die cause censor study time death . Probability curve construct Kaplan-Meier method compare log-rank test . We use proportional-hazards model forward selection determine influence patient ' baseline characteristic cancer-related survival variable . The surgical procedure variable reach p value le 0•10 univariate analysis undergo multivariate analysis identify independent predictor . Categorical variable compare χ2 test , Yates correction necessary . Continuous variable compare Student 's test Mann-Whitney U test , depend distribution . All p value two-sided p value le 0•05 indicating significant difference . All calculation perform SPSS ( version 18.0 Windows ) .</detailed_description>
