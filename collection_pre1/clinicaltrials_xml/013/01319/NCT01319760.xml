	<brief_summary>A prospective , randomize , control multi-site feasibility trial assess potential role IMPELLA® 2.5 System reduce infarct size patient ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MINI-AMI : Minimizing Infarct Size With Impella 2.5 Following PCI Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate whether adjunctive use IMPELLA® 2.5 System 24 hour follow primary PCI STEMI potential limit infarction at-risk myocardium compare primary PCI routine post-PCI care ( standard care ) . This study feasibility study . Therefore , principal objective identify trend cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -based efficacy outcome randomize treatment arm ( Impella arm compare control ) .</detailed_description>
