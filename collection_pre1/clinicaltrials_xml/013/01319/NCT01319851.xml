	<brief_summary>Allogeneic blood marrow transplantation remain viable cure child suffer many serious non-malignant hematological disease . Transplantation , however , carry high risk fatal complication . Much risk stem use high dose radiation chemotherapy conditioning , treatment administer prior transplant eliminate patient ' marrow immune system , effectively prevent rejection donor ' cell . Attempts make blood marrow transplantation safer child non-malignant disease use low dos radiation chemotherapy largely fail high rate graft rejection . In many case , likely graft reject recipient sensitized protein donor cell , include bone marrow cell , blood transfusion . The formation memory immune cell hallmark sensitization , memory cell relatively insensitive chemotherapy radiation . Alefacept , drug use treat psoriasis , hand , selectively deplete cell . The investigator conduct pilot study begin determine whether incorporate alefacept low dose condition regimen effectively mitigate sensitization , thereby , prevent rejection allogeneic blood marrow transplant multiply transfused child non-malignant hematological disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There large number serious non-malignant disease childhood , congenital rare , correct HSCT . These disease characterize deficiency , either number function , marrow derive cell . These disease usually affect immune blood cell frequently involve transfusion therapy erythrocytes , platelet granulocyte . Examples diseases include sickle cell disease , thalassemia major , Glanzmann thrombasthenia , Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome , chronic-granulomatous disease , severe congenital neutropenia , leukocyte adhesion deficiency , Shwachman-Diamond syndrome , Diamond-Blackfan anemia , Fanconi anemia , dyskeratosis-congenita , Chediak-Higashi syndrome , severe aplastic anemia . Allogeneic blood HSCT , whether perform malignant non-malignant condition , relies use pre-transplant conditioning regimen . Traditionally , high dos chemotherapy total body irradiation utilized conditioning . The use intensive conditioning , , practically speak eliminates host marrow immune system , however , produce serious sometimes fatal infection injury vital organ , liver lung . In child , use intensive conditioning also produce serious late effect , include hypogonadism , stunt growth , impaired cognitive development secondary malignancy . Over past decade , move minimize risk complication reduce intensity conditioning regimen . Added impetus reduce condition intensity arose observation transplantation thalassemia sickle cell disease sustain mixed chimerism , partial donor engraftment , usually sufficient cure non-malignant disease . This observation suggest sustained engraftment could achieve without `` ablation '' elimination host marrow . Pre-clinical study demonstrate small large animal sustain mixed chimerism achieve preparative regimen consist TBI dos low 100-300 cGy ( comparison , standard intensity regimens typically employ 1000 cGy combination chemotherapy ) . This approach first translate clinical trial involve 45 adult hematological malignancy candidate standard condition old age serious co-morbidities . Using single 200 cGy dose TBI , sustain engraftment achieve 80 % case , remarkably , transplant relate mortality 6.7 % frail group patient 14 month . It also notable transplant perform primarily outpatient setting-the median length hospitalization 1 day . Low-dose TBI base conditioning also safely effectively utilized infant child severe combine immune deficiency severe immune deficiency , undergo relate unrelated donor transplantation . This clinical experience strongly suggest effective low-dose TBI condition regimen develop child non-malignant disease could transform BMT costly , highly morbid , sometimes life-taking procedure relatively inexpensive , safe well-tolerated one . Thousands thousand child around world suffer sickle cell disease thalassemia major . There myriad less common serious non-malignant hematological disease , even devastate effect , HSCT remain viable cure . Low-dose TBI base conditioning represent minimally toxic approach transplantation children-a way overcome alloimmunization , however , need make approach effective . Alefacept , currently FDA approve agent specifically target memory T cell , investigator believe , hold key make low-dose TBI base conditioning effective could , thereby , dramatically alter field transplantation non-malignant disease . sustain donor engraftment need develop .</detailed_description>
