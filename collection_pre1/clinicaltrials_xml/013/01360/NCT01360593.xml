	<brief_title>Gemcitabine/Capecitabine Followed SBRT Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject baseline CT FDG-PET/CT prior initiation therapy . This do Hillman Radiation Oncology . Enrolled patient undergo appropriate lab work stag describe 1 . Albumin , alkaline phosphatase , glucose , electrolytes 2 . Ca 19-9 CEA 3 . Due interaction capecitabine oral coumadin-derivative anticoagulant risk bleeding/thrombotic event , patient coumadin , frequent monitoring INR dose adjustment anticoagulant must exercise protocol treatment . Alternatively , low molecular weight heparin may substitute oral anticoagulant Chemotherapy initiate consist gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 IV day 1 8 21 day cycle . Dosage gemcitabine describe use Body surface area ( BSA ) . BSA calculate body weight kg , record prior every gemcitabine dosing , height cm , record baseline . Premedication Gemcitabine A standard , FDA-approved antiemetic medication administer study participant discretion treat oncologist ( investigator ) one-half hour prior gemcitabine infusion . Examples standard antiemetic include ondansetron ( Zofran ) , granisetron ( Kytril ) , dolasetron ( Anzemet ) , compazine , dexamethasone . The dosage route administration determine treat oncologist base upon give clinical scenario . In addition , capecitabine 650mg/m2 PO take twice daily day 1-14 3 week cycle . Four cycle total ( 12 week ) chemotherapy give . Dosage capecitabine describe use Body surface area ( BSA ) . BSA calculate body weight kg , record prior every capecitabine dosing , height cm , record baseline . Capecitabine ( Xeloda ; F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG , Basel , Switzerland ) supply Ô¨Ålm-coated tablet two dose strength ( 150 500 mg ) ; close practical dose ( round ) calculate body-surface area base combination tablet take within 30 minute end meal . Patients assess chemotherapy appropriate dose modification make base toxicity . Following completion chemotherapy , new FDG-PET/CT CT obtain assess response plan SBRT . For patient SD , PR , CR , SBRT plan deliver . Fidiucial placement In addition , patient fiducial marker place localization time SBRT . Three five soft-tissue fiducials ( marker ) place and/or around tumor , least 1cm apart . Oftentimes , place time endoscopic ultrasound biopsy diagnosis . If case , patient schedule repeat EUS marker place prior CT FDG-PET/CT simulation . Alternatively , fiducials may place time stag laparoscopy . Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Planning SBRT do Shadyside Radiation Oncology . An SBRT plan create base disease contour CT PET . The plan deliver fractionate SBRT isodose line best encompass PTV : 12 Gy x 3 fraction ( 36 Gy total ) Careful evaluation plan conduct radiosurgical team ensure normal tissue critical structure tolerance maintain . The maximum dose ( Gy ) within treatment volume ( MD ) , prescription dose ( PD ) , ratio MD/PD ( measure heterogeneity within target volume ) , prescription isodose volume ( PIV mm3 ) , tumor volume ( TV mm3 ) , ratio PIV/TV ( measure dose conformity treatment relative target ) record . Quality Life Assessment Quality life assessment use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - General ( FACT-G ) tool , validated tool , administer subject prior treatment follow-up visit . For patient potentially resectable tumor , assess 10 - 12 week SBRT multidisciplinary team include two expert pancreas surgeon FDG-PET/CT CT scan . If deem appropriate , patient adequate response take surgical resection . This performed standard care . Time frame chemotherapy SBRT 4 cycle gemcitabine capecitabine . The SBRT start twelve week chemotherapy stop last approximately one week . Each cycle gemcitabine capecitabine three week . Upon completion treatment patient follow survival 24 month . They study approximately two year give take month . Interim medical history physical examination 4 - 6 week SBRT . Serum chemistry electrolytes include BUN , creatinine , sodium , potassium , bicarbonate , chloride , calcium , magnesium , glucose , total bilirubin , AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase prior chemotherapy treatment , 4 -6 week post-SBRT treatment , follow-up clinically indicate Hematologic study include CBC differential platelet count weekly chemotherapy session repeat 4-6 week post-SBRT treatment follow-up clinically indicated CT FDG-PET/CT scan ( consistency procedure do screening/planning continue follow-up ) obtain 10-12 week post-treatment review evidence response . Subjects demonstrate evidence distant metastasis meet RECIST criterion partial response , complete response , stable disease offer surgical exploration attempt curative resection . Subjects demonstrate unresectable disease progression disease start systemic chemotherapy discretion treat medical oncologist .</detailed_description>
