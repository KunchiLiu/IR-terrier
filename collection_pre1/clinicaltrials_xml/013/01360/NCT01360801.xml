	<criteria>Age 18 year old Patients Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) dysplasia original indication treatment Undergoing type endoscopic BE resection ablation treatment include RFA , cryotherapy , photodynamic therapy , EMR , combination . &lt; 1cm circumferential , peninsular , islandtype BE prior endoscopy ablation Ability provide write , informed consent Deferral Criteria : This category patient two specific situation , 1 ) Erosive esophagitis , , 2 ) presence nodule suspicious presence neoplasia . 1 . Erosive esophagitis : patient find erosive esophagitis , defer 3 month Index study procedure , permit aggressive medical therapy heal erosive esophagitis . After heal , Index study procedure perform 3 month later , followup endoscopy ( study closure ) perform 3 6 month ( total 9 month ) . 2 . Presence nodule suspicious neoplasia : patient find nodular lesion , Index study procedure defer 3 month , Endoscopic Mucosal Resection perform subsequently heals . Note : Only one deferral per patient permit , one deferral allow specific criterion . The end study define time followup last patient defer ; defer patient complete followup procedure time , may miss followup visit part study . ( This prevent possibility delay close study due deferral procedure late study . ) Current participation another clinical study Complete eradication BE document biopsy 3 previous endoscopic procedure perform resection/ablation Inability obtain biopsy due anticoagulation , varix , etc . Pregnancy Worse Grade C erosive esophagitis Less 3 week previous endoscopy biopsy 6 week previous endoscopic therapy ( ablation resection ) .</criteria>
