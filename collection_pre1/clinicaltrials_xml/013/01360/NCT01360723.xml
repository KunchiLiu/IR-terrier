	<brief_summary>The investigator previously point significant association urinary arsenic profile urothelial carcinoma ( UC ) risk 12-year follow-up study . Further , investigator observe increased UC risk people low plasma folate high homocysteine high plasma folate low homocysteine 2010 . S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) one factor include one-carbon metabolism pathway main donor methyl group cell . The ratio SAM metabolite S-adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH ) reflect intake level dietary folate also demonstrate extent global DNA methylation . These factor might play important role UC carcinogenesis . The investigator would expect take three year explore interaction among global DNA methylation , one-carbon metabolic pathway factor , urinary arsenic profile , polymorphism haplotype Glycine N-methyltransferase ( GNMT ) UC . In first year , investigator would measure level plasma folate , homocysteine , SAM SAH evaluate association factor UC risk . In second year , investigator would set method immunohistochemistry stain compare difference global DNA methylation bladder tissue blood . In last year , investigator would analyze GNMT gene polymorphism haplotype variation . At time , investigator would explore impact GNMT genetic variation global DNA methylation UC risk . Based result research , investigator might propose decreased ratio SAM/SAH result UC risk increase . This mechanism might change level urinary arsenic profile global DNA methylation .</brief_summary>
