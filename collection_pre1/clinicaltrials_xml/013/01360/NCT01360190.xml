	<brief_summary>The overall goal proposal study quantitative electroencephalography ( QEEG ) method detection antidepressant treatment response . The investigator develop QEEG algorithm call `` cordance '' appear provide much information brain function PET SPECT scanning , show pattern brain function appear indicative depression . Of great interest pattern appear normalize response antidepressant treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Significance/Preliminary Studies : A. Cordance . There considerable evidence indicate abnormal slow-wave activity EEG cause partial cortical deafferentation . Despite fact , clinically relevant measure deafferentation available . The investigator seek develop measure examine young old subject white-matter lesion presumably undercut cerebral cortex , well subject several different type brain disease undergone SPECT scanning . The investigator discover indicator term discordance , characteristic cortex undercut white-matter lesion , hypoperfused reason . The investigator also discover indicator investigator term concordance , characteristic cortex normal perfusion . This overall technique non-invasive assessment afferent function , cerebral perfusion , metabolism investigator call cordance mapping , subject United States patent . A detailed explanation formula use calculate cordance provide manuscript reference . The first two manuscript contains illustrative example discordance useful detection white-matter lesion degenerative disease . The second manuscript show quantitative analysis cordance HMPAO-SPECT data 27 patient variety condition , demonstrate cordance superior conventional EEG measure correlation relative perfusion . Like SPECT , cordance measurement vary accord patient ' state , high test-retest reliability detect brain lesion . B . Differential diagnosis depression . One promise application cordance differential diagnosis psychiatric illness . A `` normal '' cordance pattern one posterior dominant concordance cordance value near zero frontal region . The investigator report `` classic '' cordance pattern subject Alzheimer 's disease ( DAT ) , parietal discordance ( beta theta band ) conjunction alpha concordance shift occipital central head region . This finding consistent pattern see commonly PET SPECT , parietal hypoperfusion hypometabolism preserve metabolism central head region ( motor strip ) , know less affected Alzheimer 's change . In evaluate treatment result , investigator need determine effect medication status upon QEEG measure . Although result thus far suggest little significant effect , investigator carefully examine effect antidepressant antianxiety medication METHODS : The investigator plan examine cordance 26 subject undergoing antidepressant treatment , use neurophysiologic method ass response treatment depress patient . The project follow three specific aim : 1 ) identify physiologic index fluoxetine treatment response use quantitative EEG ; 2 ) detect early course fluoxetine treatment response response may detect ; 3 ) determine QEEG measure response distinguish subject respond treatment respond . The study test hypothesis subject receive active treatment show clinical improvement demonstrate normalization cordance map . Conversely , investigator hypothesize subject either show improvement , improvement placebo , show normalization cordance . The investigator examine hypotheses four-step plan . Specifically , investigator recruit 26 patient major depression perform baseline assessment severity depressive symptom , well QEEG study . Second , investigator enroll patient eight-week , double-blind placebo-controlled study receive either fluoxetine 20 mg. daily placebo . Third , investigator follow subject rating mood serial QEEG study determine association resolution depressive symptom QEEG cordance change . Fourth , investigator enroll subject open-label treatment end eight week examine cordance previously receive placebo , appropriate , receive fluoxetine 40 mg. daily .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All subject meet DSMIV criterion major depression base upon Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV Patient Version ( SCIDP ) ( First et al. , 1994 ) . All research personnel undergone SCIDP training , soon extend train DSMIV version . Subjects also score 17item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale &gt; 18 ( item # 1 &gt; 2 ) . All subject care clinician affiliate study time entry study , course study . Subjects serious medical illness . We exclude patient also meet criterion follow group axis I diagnosis : delirium dementia , substancerelated disorder , schizophrenia psychotic disorder , eat disorder . In addition , patient meet criterion cluster A B axis II diagnose exclude . Subjects history current past active suicidal ideation , suicide attempt exclude , patient previously fail respond adequate clinical trial fluoxetine , fail tolerate medication . Subjects suboptimal trial , however , may still consider study .</criteria>
