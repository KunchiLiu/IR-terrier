	<brief_summary>Background : - Osteoporosis condition bone become brittle likely break person age . The drug people take treat condition prevent many common hip fracture . But drug may associate problem shape structure hip bone many year use . These change hip bone may lead unusual kind hip fracture . These fracture rare , hard study . Researchers want learn fracture . Objectives : - To compare hip x-rays three group : people take osteoporosis drug several year , start take , never take drug . Eligibility : - People least 50 year age take osteoporosis drug least 5 year . - People least 50 year age take drug less 1 year . - People least 50 year age never take drug . Design : - All participant three total visit 3 year . - At first visit , take part medical history physical exam . They complete questionnaire medication use bone health . They also x-ray hip pelvis , bone density scan ( kind use test osteoporosis ) hip . Those study repeat exams medical history question followup visit . These visit take place 18 month 36 month first study visit . - At visit , participant may hip fracture show x-rays imaging study examine bone closely . - Participants receive hip replacement suffer broken bone time inform study researcher soon possible .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bisphosphonate Users Radiographic Characteristics Hip ( BURCH ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Bisphosphonates class medication treat osteoporosis prevent fracture , available decade . However , recent study show , rare occasion , may associate atypical hip fracture long-term use . Radiographic feature beak thicken along side hip bone frequently observe atypical femur fracture , study date focus finding fracture , x-ray feature . It known common x-ray feature pain symptom amongst bisphosphonate user yet experienced fracture . If difference user non-users , feature may valuable find help catch fracture happen . A recent hypothesis emerge genetic condition , hypophosphatasia , may play role . Study population : This study evaluate presence feature user bisphosphonates general population . Individuals community take bisphosphonates five year ( still take since stop ) compare individual recently start bisphosphonate treatment individual without osteoporosis take bisphosphonates similar age . Another cohort patient sustain atypical femur fracture also recruit . Design : This study look frequency subtrochanteric beak cortical thickening three group people : long-term user , short-term user , non-users . Thorough medication usage history , physical examination hip radiograph ( x-rays ) take three time course three year , one time bone density scan perform upon enrol . We also perform genetic test hypophosphatasia long term asymptomatic user patient sustain atypical femur fracture . Outcome measure : We look presence `` beak '' measure thickness hip bone certain spot . We interested see difference three group people first also two feature change three year . We also monitor thigh pain , feature impending fracture , fracture find x-ray . We compare prevalence hypophosphatasia mutation asymptomatic bisphosphonate user subject sustain atypical femur fracture .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA LONGITUDINAL STUDY GROUP : For respective group , individual need either : 1 . Diagnosis Osteoporosis Osteopenia AND receive bisphosphonate therapy least 5 year 2 . Diagnosis Osteoporosis Osteopenia AND receive bisphosphonate therapy less 1 year 3 . Diagnosis Osteoporosis Osteopenia AND receive bisphosphonate therapy 1 5 year 4 . No Diagnosis Osteoporosis Osteopenia AND never receive bisphosphonate therapy Inclusion Criteria In Common Will Be : 1 . Age 50 old 2 . Ambulatory 3 . Living independently EXCLUSION CRITERIA LONGITUDINAL STUDY GROUP : Exclusion Criteria Will Be : 1 . Inability provide inform consent 2 . Cognitive Impairment ( MCI/dementia ) 3 . Current diagnosis cancer include : breast , prostate , lung , colon , stomach , bladder , uterus , rectum , thyroid , kidney 4 . Previous bilateral hip fracture 5 . Pregnancy 6 . Small bowel resection 7 . Malabsorption 8 . Paget Disease Bone 9 . Preexisting osteomalacia , active malignancy , prior bone metastasis , osteogenesis imperfecta , fibrous dysplasia , history kidney failure . INCLUSION CRITERIA GENETICS STUDY GROUP : For respective group , individual need either : 1 . Diagnosis atypical femur fracture within past 10 year , regardless bisphosphonate use . OR 2 . Diagnosis Osteoporosis Osteopenia AND receive bisphosphonate therapy least 5 year without atypical femur fracture . Inclusion Criteria In Common Will Be : 1 . Age 45 old 2 . Ambulatory 3 . Living independently EXCLUSION CRITERIA GENETICS STUDY GROUP : Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Inability provide inform consent 2 . Cognitive Impairment ( MCI/dementia ) 3 . Current diagnosis cancer include : breast , prostate , lung , colon , stomach , bladder , uterus , rectum , thyroid , kidney 4 . Pregnancy 5 . Small bowel resection 6 . Malabsorption 7 . Paget Disease Bone The following information pertains individual Longitudinal Group . Individuals currently thigh pain exclude study . As goal study correlate medication usage radiographic feature , individual concurrently thigh pain still consider , take note duration medication usage start thigh pain per participant history . Duration thigh pain prior fracture likewise consider . If current fracture find radiographs suspicion high fracture , select participant send MRI bilateral femur participant refer back primary provider additional evaluation treatment . Individuals previously unilateral hip fracture arthroplasty also exclude . As several previous study show , bilateral fracture uncommon . We continue monitor progress contralateral hip . We query detail regard history first fracture medication usage . These participant subanalyzed medication usage time fracture . Individuals bilateral ( unilateral ) fracture bilateral arthroplasty initially exclude . However , individual find unilateral bilateral fracture radiographic study undergo unilateral bilateral arthroplasty three year participation allow remain protocol , assess change anatomy . Individuals treat corticosteroid type medication exclude study . These variable consider confounders analyzed univariate analysis . Individuals anatomical variation coxa vara coxa valga exclude . We assume equally distribute control treatment group . These individual may high risk atypical fracture , subanalyzed appropriate femoralangle match control . Controls choose begin bisphosphonate study exclude study , include subanalysis individual less 3 year bisphosphonate exposure . Likewise , participant choose discontinue bisphosphonate usage also drop study . Analysis carry group designate intent treat . Users take drug 5 year currently drug holiday eligible ( drug stay bone long ) .</criteria>
