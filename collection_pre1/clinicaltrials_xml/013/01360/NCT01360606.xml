	<brief_summary>This phase I dose escalation study . Dose escalation via traditional `` '' scheme . SBRT : Patients receive one follow radiation regimen : - 50 Gy 5 fraction ( 10 Gy/fx ) deliver 2-week period . - 60 Gy 5 fraction ( 12 Gy/fx ) deliver 2-week period . - 75 Gy 5 fraction ( 15 Gy/fx ) deliver 2-week period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) Liver Mets</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior enrollment patient evaluate physical exam , review pathology laboratory value confirm diagnosis , baseline imaging study . Accelerator Physicians treat stereotactic radiosurgery system use 6MV photon deliver stereotactic body radiotherapy . Doses Patients receive total dose range 50-75 Gy 5 fraction ( 10-15 Gy/fx ) . Dose escalation via traditional `` '' scheme . In determine radiation dose fractionation scheme protocol , use linear-quadratic formalism radiation cell kill `` equate '' scheme vary dose/fraction number fraction . This concept biologically equivalent dose ( BED ) state total effect give : nd x ( 1 + d/ ( alpha-beta ratio ) ) n # fraction dose/fraction . The `` alpha-beta ratio '' characterize radiation response particular tissue ; high value indicative tissue respond acutely effect radiation . Due highly proliferative nature , tumor fall category . This final dose scheme ( total dose 75 Gy ) biologically equivalent previously study dos literature ( 60 Gy 3 fraction ) , mean first two set patient treat radiobiologically small ( likely safer ) dose . We would favor treat five fraction , oppose three , allow repair normal tissue , reoxygenation tumor cell , redistribution tumor cell radiosensitive part cell cycle . Using small fraction size , 10-15 Gy compare 20 Gy , also help reduce late effect radiation therapy . SBRT treatment give every day schedule , exclude weekend . The prescription dose prescribe isodose line best encompass plan target volume ( PTV ) depend volume tumor ( HCC ) . Localization , immobilization , simulation Within 5 - 10 day fiducial placement , pPatients undergo 4D FDG-PET/CT simulation goal evaluate tumor motion allow gate treatment indicate . This goal accomplish use Real-time Position Management ( RPM ) system ( Varian Medical Systems , Palo Alto , CA ) create retrospective 4D CT scan . Following institutional protocol , helical CT scan 4D positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan patient body immobilization device acquire . A patient eat drink anything four hour PET scan . Before PET scan , blood sample take either finger stick vein arm check sugar level . An injection small amount radioactive drug call FDG ( [ F18 ] fluorodeoxyglucose ) chemical similar sugar administer vein arm hand . Approximately 45 60 minute injection FDG , patient ask urinate ( empty bladder ) . The patient set PET/CT scanner use vacuum cushion immobilization supine position foot tie hand across chest head . There also respiration-monitoring device call marker block place 5cm patient 's xyphoid process . An infrared camera foot CT table capture image marker block relay RPM computer , turn translate image respiratory pattern . The audio coach ( instruct patient regulate breathe ) calibrate patient comfort time expiration , inspiration , full breathing cycle . The place patient body immobilization device take 10-15 minute . The patient need lie still 30 minute completion 4D PET scan . The PET/CT scanner program acquire retrospective 4D CT scan set image phase breathe cycle . This scan take place immediately PET scan . It take around 5-10 minute . The physician physicist select number breathing phase use software program select best image select breathe phase . The entire FDG-PET/CT scan procedure expect take 2 hour . Treatment Planning Treatment plan carry use plan station radiosurgery equipment use treatment . The gross tumor volume ( GTV ) contour fused image set . Two GTV volume contour ; gross tumor see CT alone gross tumor correspond FDG avidity . No margin add clinical target volume ( CTV ) , custom margin add planning target volume ( PTV ) base finding 4D FDG-PET/CT motion study assessment . The treatment prescribe isodose line best cover plan target volume , typically 80 % isodose line . Treatment Delivery SBRT take place within 14 day treatment planning scan . The planning data contain coordinate tumor isocenter , external infrared marker , implant marker transfer appropriate platform depend treat machine . If patient meet criteria gate technique treatment delivery accomplish use appropriate gating technology . Depending technology use external infrared marker attach patient 's skin marker block place patient 's chest use determine breathe pattern . The size beam-on window determine base target motion detect 4D FDG-PET/CT scan . The threshold gate treatment delivery determine base upon target motion due respiration . The daily initial position treatment delivery perform use laser skin mark infrared optical marker appropriate . The target isocenter verify use daily imaging . Depending platform use , move target position within beam infrared and/or image guidance</detailed_description>
