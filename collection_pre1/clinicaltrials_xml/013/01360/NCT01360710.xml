	<brief_summary>Obesity major risk factor development hypertension . Based population study , risk estimate indicate least two-thirds prevalence hypertension directly attribute obesity . Obesity per se commonly associate activation sympathetic nervous system predominant increase sympathetic outflow kidney peripheral vasculature conclusive evidence heighten sympathetic nerve activity major contributor elevation blood pressure associate obesity , particularly young subject . In line finding , dietary weight loss repeatedly demonstrate result reduce sympathetic nerve activity lower blood pressure level . Several line evidence well document significant role SNS activation obesity associate hypertension target organ damage . Weight loss prefer treatment option obesity consequence reduce SNS activation blood pressure . In real world however , weight loss maintenance rarely achieve obese patient highlight urgent need alternative treatment strategy . Given crucial involvement SNS activation various aspect obesity relate increase blood pressure , target organ damage cardiovascular risk , use sympatho-inhibitory agent early stage obvious choice . The investigator therefore plan examine effect centrally sympatholytic agent moxonidine blood pressure morning surge blood pressure , sympathetic activity , regression early target organ damage ( heart , kidney endothelium ) , metabolic inflammatory marker young obese subject hypertension randomize , double-blind clinical trial angiotensin receptor blocker irbesartan active comparator achieve similar blood pressure reduction group . The investigator hypothesize moxonidine treatment result significant improvement outcome parameter beneficial effect beyond simple blood pressure reduction . Findings study could pave way early pathophysiology- tailor treatment strategy obesity relate hypertension detrimental consequence .</brief_summary>
