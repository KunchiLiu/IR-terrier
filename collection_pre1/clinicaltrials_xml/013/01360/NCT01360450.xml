	<brief_summary>Thousands critically ill infant ( child ) expose opioids benzodiazepine achieve sedation analgesia part routine care neonatal pediatric intensive care unit . While use agent undisputedly beneficial reduce pain anxiety , improve ventilation , reduce pulmonary vascular resistance improve outcome ; consequence often development tolerance physiologic dependence - similar prenatal exposure class drug . The investigator recently report result randomized placebo control trial show addition clonidine ( central alpha 2 agonist ) tapering dos opioids efficacious safe treat opioid dependence infant moderate severe neonatal abstinence syndrome prenatal drug exposure opioids . Currently , investigator propose perform double-blind , randomize placebo control trial cohort critically ill infant without prenatal drug exposure Johns Hopkins Hospital test overall hypothesis early addition clonidine cohort critically ill neonate mechanical ventilation receive opioids benzodiazepine analgesia sedation efficacious safe reduce incidence severity withdrawal symptom ( NICU-NAS ) ; well , reduce time complete sedative analgesic drug detoxification . The hypothesis test address 2 specific aim determine : 1 ) efficacy safety clonidine critically ill infant , 2 ) pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics use population-based pharmacokinetics vulnerable infant population expose drug part routine care . Many `` standard care practice '' incorporate neonatal pediatric care prior evidence base study . This proposal fill much need gap translate investigator learn basic mechanism mediate dependence withdrawal proven therapy vulnerable pediatric population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clonidine Treat Iatrogenic-induced Opioid Dependence Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study test follow 2 specific aim : Specific Aim 1 To determine efficacy short-term safety clonidine reduce severity iatrogenic neonatal abstinence syndrome ( NAS ) decrease time required complete sedative analgesic drug detoxification . The investigator enroll 88 neonate risk moderate severe NAS randomize , double-blinded placebo control trial compare opioid/benzodiazepine administration combine placebo ( control ) vs. opioid/benzodiazepine combine clonidine . Principal outcome measure difference length treatment complete detoxification . Early safety clonidine determine monitor cardiorespiratory side effect might associate clonidine use high risk population . Specific Aim 2 To determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics clonidine critically ill infant population . The investigator estimate dose-exposure-response relationship clonidine neonate risk develop iatrogenic use nonlinear mixed-effects population pharmacokinetic ( PK ) -pharmacodynamic ( PD ) analysis .</detailed_description>
