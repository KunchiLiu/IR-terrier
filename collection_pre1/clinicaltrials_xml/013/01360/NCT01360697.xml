	<brief_summary>In demonstration project ( JADE Jiangsu &amp; Anhui Program , JADE-JA short ) lead key opinion leader field diabetes endocrinology Jiangsu Anhui area support ADF , shall recruit 4800 type 2 diabetic patient attend medical out-patient clinic area compare effect usual versus structure care ( non-JADE v JADE ) metabolic control , quality life behavioral change . After explanation train doctor nurse write informed consent , patient randomize either JADE non-JADE group . The former encompasses component structure care deliver trio-team doctor , nurse Healthcare Assistant ( HCA ) non-JADE group consist comprehensive assessment ( CA ) baseline 12-month patient manage usual manner thereafter . At end 12 month , patient undergo repeat comprehensive assessment comparison rate attainment treatment target , behavioral change , quality life default rate .
