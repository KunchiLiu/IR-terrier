	<brief_summary>This prospective , comparative control analysis . The investigator want evaluate aqueous humor level vascular endothelial growth factor polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy effect photodynamic therapy combination treatment photodynamic therapy Lucentis ( Ranibizumab ) level vascular endothelial growth factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aqueous Humor Level Cytokines Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy Change Cytokines After Photodynamic Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare effect combination therapy intravitreal injection Lucentis™ photodynamic therapy versus photodynamic therapy aqueous humor vascular endothelial growth factor level polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy patient establish vascular endothelial growth factor expression photodynamic therapy direct effect Lucentis™ increase vascular endothelial growth factor level . Additionally investigator want examine vascular endothelial growth factor , tumor necrosis factor alpha , interleukin-2 , interleukin-6 interleukin-8 level aqueous humor symptomatic , active polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy patient .</detailed_description>
