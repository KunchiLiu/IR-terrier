	<brief_summary>Rationale study : Correction hypocholesteremia insulin resistance successful eradication HCV combination therapy interferon ribavirin show several study . The majority study examine genotype 1 genotype 3 patient , clear result achieve genotypes HCV . Moreover , clinical data relationship different adipocytokines , metabolic profile , HCV treatment value understand mechanism HCVrelated metabolic alteration . The present proposal design address paradox HCV-related metabolic alterations/adipocytokine alteration determine BMI influence HCV-related metabolic alteration/adipocytokine aterations collect analyze sample human HCV infection prior combination peginterferon alpha-2b plus ribavirin For metabolic alternation : Lipid profile : After treatment , responder genotype I II experience increase cholesterol level LDL level nonresponders/ relapseres . Insulin resistance : After treatment , responder genotype I II experience decrease HOMA-IR nonresponders/ relapseres ; high percentage responder achieve HOMA-IR &lt; 2 nonresponders/ relapseres B . For adipocytokine alternation , study exploratory propose still little well establish consensus .</brief_summary>
