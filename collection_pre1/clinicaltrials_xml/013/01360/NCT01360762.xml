	<detailed_description>Visceral leishmaniosis ( VL ) Ethiopia report different part country , approximately 30 % case associate human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . The ruralisation HIV epidemic VL endemic area hamper effort control VL . Clinical experience Ethiopia show anti-leishmanial treatment absence anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) result favourable outcome : poor prognosis , high mortality relapse rate characteristic Ethiopian VL patient HIV co-infection . The effective management initial VL episode , timely ART , prevention relapse cornerstones effective management HIV/VL co-infection . However , parasitological cure VL HIV co-infected patient easily establish , cellular immunity return ART , patient risk relapse VL , result death , severe illness , negative effect ART efficacy lead opportunistic infection ( OIs ) , emergence drug-resistant parasite , possibly transmission drug-resistant Leishmania donovani . Patients vulnerable relapse 1 ) high level immunosuppression , 2 ) patient previous VL episode , 3 ) patient OIs . ART reduce risk VL relapse/recurrence ~50 % , type anti-leishmanial primary treatment little effect relapse ; important factor seem clearance visible parasite ( residual parasite see end treatment , relapse rate 100 % ) . Limited study Europe show HIV co-infected patient may benefit secondary prevention , significantly prolong relapse-free period . The drug study secondary prophylaxis Europe meglumine antimoniate AmBisome , part mainstay treatment VL Ethiopia , pentamidine ( PM ) , use VL treatment Africa . The effect maintenance treatment study African VL , poor outcome without secondary prevention highlight clear need offer good care patient high risk relapse . Indeed , secondary prophylaxis generally recommend Europe United States ( see 2009 Center Disease Control guideline ) . PM 4 mg/kg intravenous ( IV ) every 3-4 week propose secondary prophylaxis , already used country like United Kingdom Spain . Consequently , prospective cohort study aim document patient 's outcome secondary prophylaxis PM VL-HIV co-infection , term time relapse death , safety feasibility , consider general use Ethiopia . A placebo group include , due clear advantage intervention patient population target herewith . Furthermore available VL treatment use main line treatment , consider alternative comparators , give potential risk rapid emergence drug resistance subsequent spread area anthroponotic VL .</detailed_description>
