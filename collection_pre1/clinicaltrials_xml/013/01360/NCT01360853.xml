	<brief_summary>The question ask study : Will patient advance pancreatic cancer live significantly longer treated combination Gemcitabine ON 01910.Na treat Gemcitabine alone ? There two part study . In first part study , patient metastatic pancreatic cancer receive prior chemotherapy disease assign chance either group treat Gemcitabine ON 01910.Na ( 100 patient group ) , group treat Gemcitabine ( 50 patient group ) . How long patient survive 2 group compare . If look like difference group , study stop . If look like patient group treat Gemcitabine ON 01910.Na survive long , study continue second part patient treat order confirm well understand finding first part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase III study sample size recalculation 100 event occur . The study open-label , randomize , control , multi-center conduct approximately 200 300 study site ( 60 80 study site first portion trial ) . In first portion study , total 150 patient metastatic pancreatic cancer receive prior chemotherapy disease randomize 2:1 fashion 1 2 follow treatment regimen : - Arm A : Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 weekly 3 week 4 week cycle + ON 01910.Na 1800 mg/m2 via 2 hr continuous intravenous infusion ( CIV ) infusion administer twice weekly 3 week 4 week cycle ( approximately 100 patient ) - Arm B : Gemcitabine , 1000 mg/m2 weekly 3 week 4 week cycle ( approximately 50 patient ) . Patients stratify entry use Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( ECOG score 0 1 vs. ECOG score 2 ; patient high score enrol ) . Patients remain study disease progression death cause , whichever come first . Moreover , treatment discontinuation cause , patient follow death . After 150 patient enrol , accrual pause patient follow 100 death occur . At time , Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) oversee formal interim analysis compare overall survival ( OS ) 2 group may recommend early stopping futility . If study continue interim analysis , randomization scheme continue 364 patient newly-calculated sample size . The maximum number enrol patient 650 . The number clinical site may expand approximately 200 300 center . Patients gemcitabine-only arm ( Arm B ) allow cross combine treatment arm ( Arm A ) . In addition , palliative radiotherapy allow trial . The primary analysis compare OS ON 01910.Na + gemcitabine arm ( Arm A ) vs. gemcitabine-only arm ( Arm B ) appropriate number event reach . There 2 secondary efficacy outcome : progression-free survival ( PFS ) objective response . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v4.03 . Grade 3 4 hematologic toxicity &gt; Grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity monitor .</detailed_description>
