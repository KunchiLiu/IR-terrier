	<brief_summary>Recently integrate clinical practice , Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( GOLD ) classification state mild ( stage I ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) present , smoker , postbronchodilator force expired volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) force vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.7 . A major change introduce GOLD classification system COPD could diagnose despite FEV1 within normal predict value ( 80 % predict ) . Because suggest diagnose detect COPD earlier do recently medical practice , GOLD standard bring new reality clinician . In fact , novel COPD classification come new research challenge functional impact systemic consequence relate COPD mostly document patient moderate severe stage little information specifically GOLD stage I COPD . This information important investigator convince physician GOLD stage I COPD need diagnose eventually treat . The investigator aim characterize GOLD stage I COPD patient accord activity-related dyspnea . More specifically , objective compare : ) baseline pulmonary function ii ) exercise capacity iii ) quadriceps muscle function iv ) level physical activity daily life symptomatic ( Sx ) GOLD stage I COPD patient , asymptomatic ( ASx ) GOLD stage I COPD patient healthy control subject ( CTRL ) . The investigator reason exercise tolerance physical activity level would decrease Sx GOLD stage I COPD patient would similar ASx GOLD stage I COPD patient CTRL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct among three subgroup : symptomatic GOLD stage I patient COPD , asymptomatic patient GOLD stage I COPD healthy control subject normal lung function . Subjects paired age , sex smoke history . The project require three visit . In initial visit , assessment pulmonary function respiratory symptom quantification allow classify subject proper subgroup . The Medical Research Council ( MRC ) dyspnea scale serve reference outcome determine whether COPD patient symptomatic . Patients MRC dyspnea score &lt; 2 consider asymptomatic . A second questionnaire ( ATS-DLD-78 ) serve document cough , expectoration , wheeze smoke history every subject . Body composition measure bioimpedance waist circumference blood sample take morning , fast state . A six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) perform subject . After one-hour resting period , maximal incremental shuttle walk test realize visit quantify maximal exercise capacity . Measures force endurance quadriceps take magnetic stimulation femoral nerve maximal walk test . Finally , subject receive portable device monitor physical activity period 7 day . In 2nd 3rd visit , subject realize endurance walk test 85 % predetermine maximal capacity . Before endurance test , bronchodilator placebo administer follow randomize double-blind design . Measures force endurance quadriceps take magnetic stimulation femoral nerve 10-min endurance exercise test . A needle biopsy vastus lateralis perform end third visit .</detailed_description>
