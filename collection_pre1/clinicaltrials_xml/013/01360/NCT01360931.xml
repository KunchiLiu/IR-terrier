	<detailed_description>Objectives 1 . To demonstrate presence NE vitro entrance lung adenocarcinoma cell 2 . To identify intracellular mechanism NE mediate tumor proliferate effect 3 . To verify activation NE relate pathway component clinical lung adenocarcinoma specimens Background research Lung Cancer Hong Kong Lung cancer lead cause cancer death Hong Kong [ 1 ] . Surgical resection early stage lung cancer curative option advance stage lung cancer treat chemoirradiation molecular target agent , one Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor - Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( EGFR-TKI ) . Recent advance molecular biology lung cancer allow development target therapy . However , treatment response depend presence activate EGFR gene mutation , median response period usually maintain nine twelve month , tumor usually become non-responsive resistant EGFR-TKI . EGFR mutation v EGFR wildtype lung adenocarcinoma In Asian population include Hong Kong , EGFR mutation exon 18 - 21 present 50 % lung adenocarcinoma , 50 % EGFR wild type lung adenocarcinomas usually bear K-ras gene mutation [ 2 ] . Even presence activate EGFR gene mutation exon 18 - 21 , clinical response observe 70 % patient tumor bear EGFR mutation [ 3 ] . It apparent cohort lung adenocarcinoma , follow grouping accord EGFR gene mutation status : ( ) EGFR mutate lung adenocarcinoma ( ~50 % ) 1. response TKI treatment ( ~35 % ) 2. unresponsive TKI treatment ( ~15 % ) ( ii ) EGFR wildtype lung adenocarcinoma ( ~50 % ) The presence group ( ) ( b ) tumor EGFR fail response treatment would mean suboptimal target EGFR presence group ( ii ) EGFR wildtype tumor would imply alternative pathway mediate tumor progression susceptibility tumor therapy lung cancer . Exploration molecular pathway lung adenocarcinoma may allow discovery new molecular target therapeutic development lung cancer . Neutrophils vs cancer cell Neutrophil infiltration , hence inflammatory infiltrate , frequently observe lung cancer [ 4 ] . Recognized similarity neutrophil cancer cell include : 1. ability circulate single cell 2. target attachment via vascular system 3. target invasion Neutrophils achieve migration pulmonary epithelial layer secrete NE , readily balance local action secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor ( SLPI ) . SLPI also detect cancer tissue relevant function role lung cancer define yet [ 5 ] . The major difference neutrophil cancer cell lie fact migrate neutrophil undergo apoptosis cancer cell escape apoptosis able proliferate target organ . The possible role NE lung cancer This lead speculation neutrophil cancer cell may share similar inflammatory cascade secrete similar panel protease , one demonstrate neutrophil elastase ( NE ) . The action NE may happen different cellular level : ( 1 ) action extracellular matrix facilitate migration tissue invasion ; ( 2 ) action cell surface signal receptor ; ( 3 ) intracellular action signal pathway follow uptake signal endosomes . There recent evidence animal study NE secrete neutrophil actually move lung tumor cell mediate lung tumor growth via degradation Insulin receptor substrate-1 ( IRS-1 ) subsequent effect intracellular PI3K signal pathway act intracellular tyrosine kinase domain platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) [ 6 ] . It possible neutrophils infiltrating lung tumor stromal tissue may act collaboration cancer cell via direct indirect action NE . Work do others Immunoreactive NE , free complex form , demonstrate breast cancer cell line [ 7 ] lung cancer cell line [ 8 ] . NE activity demonstrate human breast cancer tissue [ 9 ] human lung cancer tissue normal lung tissue . These show NE present tissue level intracellular action , whether enzymatically active signal active , delineate clearly yet . In breast cancer tissue , high amount extract tissue NE , bad prognosis [ 9 ] similar prognostic significance suggest NE non-small cell lung cancer [ 10 ] . When lung cancer cell inoculate severe combine immunodeficiency ( SCID ) mouse , concomitant administration NE inhibitor , ONO-5046 , completely suppressed tumor growth appearance metastatic focus [ 11 ] . The exact mechanism action ONO-5046 remain clarified . NE also show cleave cell surface epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) transform growth factor-alpha ( TGF-α ) [ 12 , 13 ] . This may send aberrant signal tumor cell EGF receptor promote cancer cell proliferation vitro . TGF-α also induce NE expression human cancer cell line ( breast pancreas ) There recent work Houghton et al [ 6 ] demonstrate NE could influence lung cancer growth development : 1. permeate lung tumor cell ( A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line Kras mutation ) , via degradation IRS-1 , mediate tumor cell progression . 2. block specific inhibitor ( ONO-5046 ) , lead aberrant intracellular signal tumor cell growth arrest . Work do group NE airway inflammation Our group do work related role NE airway inflammation disease raise cancer normal bronchial bronchial epithelial cell line local patient would appropriate model test hypothesis local patient population . Syndecan-1 find able bind NE sputum sol bronchiectasis , support role NE complexed syndecan-1 balance antielastase [ 14 ] . We also demonstrate shed syndecan-1 human lymphoid cell line able bind NE , disturb NE anti-elastase balance airway environment , thus could play role airway inflammation [ 15 ] . We try unopposed NE airway fluid cigarette smoke-induced model COPD rat . Sulfated maltoheptaose chelate NE administer rat bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) lung tissue collect 3 day administration show significant decline NE activity myeloperoxidase activity compare BALF smoke rat treat . Significant reduction neutrophil accumulation also observe BALF lung tissue section . Airspace enlargement significantly reduce follow treatment . All result suggest sulfated maltohepatose potential therapeutic neutrophilic inflammation airways patient COPD . ( unpublished data ) . We also test NE activity lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 find radio-labelled cell migrate lung cancer cell enzymatically inactive ( unpublished data ) Lung cancer cell line normal bronchial epithelial cell clinical lung cancer tissue bank We recently establish primary lung cancer normal bronchial epithelial cell line local Chinese patient characterize vitro growth kinetics , morphological immunohistochemical study gene expression profile [ 16 ] . At moment , : 1 . Four primary lung adenocarcinoma cell line ( HKULC 1 - 4 ) publish [ 16 ] six newly establish various phase characterization . 2 . Two new normal bronchial epithelial cell line immortalize standard protocol cdk4 hTert infection [ 17 ] . These new cell line derive clinical specimen local Hong Kong Chinese patient become establish continued accrual clinical collection . The clinical data patient , include gender smoking history , primary lung adenocarcinoma cell line originate know . Together 10 ATCC lung adenocarcinoma cell line establish normal bronchial epithelial line ( HBEC-KT 1 - 5 ) John Minna MD , Tx , USA , cell line provide invaluable material test vivo effect NE cancer cell . With collaboration Queen Mary Hospital Cardiothoracic Surgical Department , also collect 40 pair resect lung adenocarcinoma normal lung tissue allow verification vitro finding clinical specimen . Further collection accrual clinical specimen progress The research question address ( Figure 1 ) : 1 . What roles NE lung adenocarcinoma proliferation ? 2 . How role NE mediate intracellular signal level ? Is IRS-1/PI3K/PDGFR common axis involved cancer cell ? Or 'cross-talk ' pathway EGFR TNF-α lung adenocarcinoma proliferation ? 3 .
