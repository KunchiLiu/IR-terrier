	<brief_summary>This proposal respond Request Applications RFA-MH-08-131 , seek application propose enrich pre-existing resource schizophrenia NIMH Human Genetics Initiative apply genomic method understand molecular etiology disorder . The overarch aim proposal quickly cost-effectively ascertain large sample trio family affect schizophrenia , discover causal variant disorder first family-based genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) disorder . In Taiwan , kind policy support kind GWAS study expensive study , include collect large family sample genome-wide SNP scan . The investigator , thus , collaborate Professor Ming T , Tsuang intend subcontract researcher apply project . The investigator , research team Taiwan , collect 3800 trio family ( 11400 subject ) schizophrenia . The investigator meet overarching goal project accomplish several Specific Aims , follow : 1 ) Rapidly ascertain schizophrenia trio family Taiwanese clinical ascertainment site ; 2 ) Supplement NIMH Genetics Initiative collection send clinical data biomaterials appropriate repository ; 3 ) Assess association schizophrenia genome-wide panel single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) constituent haplotype ; 4 ) Analyze quantitative schizophrenia phenotype age onset ; 5 ) Perform genome-wide survey copy-number variation relate schizophrenia ; 6 ) Test gene-gene interaction ( epistasis ) ; 7 ) Test gene-environment interaction , well-established effect season birth .</brief_summary>
