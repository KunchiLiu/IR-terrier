	<brief_summary>Metformin biguanide market oral anti-diabetic drug . Metformin treatment concert diet exercise consensus first-line treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , therefore likely adjunct therapy asset development GSK treatment T2DM . Metformin potent effect lower circulate glucose concentration , believe additional benefit improve macrovascular outcome , fatty liver disease polycystic ovarian syndrome . Its use significant proportion T2DM subject limit contraindication heart failure renal insufficiency gastrointestinal side effect . The mechanisms underlying glucose-lowering effect adverse event profile metformin well understood . Whilst activation AMP kinase may important therapeutic effect , change incretin secretion bile acid excretion describe , consistently link therapeutic effect AE profile . The aim study recruit T2DM patient prescribe metformin monotherapy investigate glucose effect related alteration bile acid absorption , incretin lipid profile study parameter drug . This do combination frequent capillary blood glucose monitoring ensure patient safety . This study facilitate development pharmacodynamic model use clinical team develop non-absorbable NCEs iBAT inhibitor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As metformin become first-line therapy T2DM patient many country , important ensure early-on development novel anti-diabetic NCEs work well add-on drug . Furthermore , broad spectrum effect metformin may relate glucose-lowering action offer opportunity use drug investigative tool explore relationship various pharmacodynamic endpoint . In situation , reliable PD endpoint essential systemic PK measurement available track NCE target activate inhibited . Therefore , clear understand metformin 's mechanism action relate glycaemic control , lipid metabolism , bile acid excretion gastrointestinal adverse effect enable EnteroEndocrine ( EE ) project team design efficient study evaluation non-absorbable NCEs target receptor accessible gut lumen , include ileal bile acid transport inhibitor . Because complexity metformin kinetics within gut , propose follow rise fall fast blood glucose metformin washout re-introduction , respectively , determine two appropriate timepoints detailed investigation . As result , subject study 4 occasion : 1 . Whilst usual stable dose metformin ( baseline state ) , 2 . 7 day stop metformin replicate washout paradigm frequently use early phase T2DM study GSK 3 . When fast capillary glucose increase 25 % pre-metformin washout level two week start wash-out period . 4 . After metformin re-introduced , fast capillary glucose return pre-metformin washout level ( baseline state establish screen ) This study entail withdrawal re-introduction metformin closely supervised condition . The withdrawal metformin maximum period three week glucose increase project expected result significant long-term risk subject . If subject already test blood glucose home , glucometer , instruction use , test strip provide capillary blood glucose ( CBG ) monitoring withdrawal reinstatement metformin . They instruct test blood glucose twice day , fast breakfast dinner , time concerned blood glucose may rise excessively . A write diary card keep subject record CBG value , begin approximately 7 day discontinuation metformin baseline assessment complete visit 1 . Fasting CBG value &gt; 15mM &lt; 3.5mM must report site . If fasting CBG &gt; 15mM &lt; 3.5 mM two consecutive day wash-out period , subject discontinue usual dose metformin reinstate , appropriate Subjects require call study centre unit alert site staff clinical unit : 1 . When CBG value &gt; 15mM 2 . When CBG value &lt; 3.5mM 3 . When concern relate CBG level 4 . When rapid , unexplained change blood glucose level Study staff attempt contact subject daily check CBG value record adverse event whilst subject home . Subjects encourage keep usual lifestyle term diet exercise duration study . The Entero-Test device simple , safe device collection duodenal bile . It well tolerate , although subject may feel slight nausea removal . Some blood may see string remove . This occur string `` nick '' oesophagus removal , minor trauma heals rapidly cause concern . Primary enpoints-During metformin wash treatment reinstate , pharmacodynamic endpoint include follow data permit : - 24h profile blood glucose insulin - Faecal serum bile acid profile - Enteroendocrine peptide profile include limited tGLP-1 , tGIP , tPYY - Serum lipid analysis include limited fasting HDL LDL cholesterol , fast prandial TGs , ApoA1 , ApoB ApoE Secondary Endpoints- • Relative bile acid composition determine EnteroTest bile string sample duodenal bile . • Sparse metformin PK profile determine plasma sample</detailed_description>
