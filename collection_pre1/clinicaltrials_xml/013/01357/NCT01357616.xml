	<criteria>Diagnosed open angle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension sufficiently responsive monotherapy . Meet qualify IOP criterion least 1 eye , include 2135 mmHg Eligibility visit . Willing sign Informed Consent form . Contact lens wearer willing remove lenses instillation study medication wait minimum 15 minute follow drug instillation reinserting lens . Able discontinue use current IOPlowering medication per minimum washout period . Other protocolspecific inclusion criterion may apply . Women childbearing potential pregnant , test positive pregnancy Screening/Enrollment visit , breastfeeding , agreement use adequate birth control method prevent pregnancy throughout study . Diagnosed form glaucoma openangle glaucoma and/or ocular hypertension . Diagnosed severe central visual field loss either eye . History chronic , recurrent , severe ocular infection , inflammatory eye disease either eye . History ocular trauma within past 6 month either eye . Current ocular infection ocular inflammation within past 3 month either eye . Ocular laser surgery within past 3 month . Intraocular surgery within past 3 month . Bestcorrected visual acuity score worse 55 ETDRS letter read ( equivalent approximately 20/80 Snellen , 0.60 logMAR 0.25 decimal ) . History , current clinically relevant progressive retinal disease either eye . History , current severe ocular pathology ( include severe dry eye ) either eye , would preclude administration topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ( CAI ) betablocker . Any abnormality prevent reliable applanation tonometry . History , current condition disease would preclude safe administration topical beta blocker topical betaadrenergic block agent . History spontaneous current hypoglycemia uncontrolled diabetes . History severe serious hypersensitivity CAIs , betablockers , component study medication . Less 30 day stable dose regimen Screening Visit medication substance administer route use chronic basis may affect IOP . Recent use highdose salicylate therapy . Anticipated use additional topical systemic ocular hypotensive medication study . Not safely able discontinue glucocorticoid medication administer route . Currently therapy therapy another investigational agent within 30 day prior Screening Visit . History , current evidence severe illness condition would , opinion Investigator , make subject unsuitable study . Other protocolspecific exclusion criterion may apply .</criteria>
