	<brief_title>Periodontal Tissue Regeneration Using Autologous Periodontal Ligament Stem Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Periodontitis inflammatory disease cause pathological alteration tooth-supporting tissue , potentially lead tooth loss . National survey show majority adult population suffer moderate periodontitis , 15 % population affect severe generalize periodontitis stage live . The significant burden periodontal disease impact general health patient quality life point clinical need effective management condition . The ultimate goal periodontal therapy predictably regeneration functional attachment apparatus destroy peridontitis , involve formation new cementum , periodontal ligament ( PDL ) , alveolar bone . To date , several therapeutic procedure attempt achieve ambitious purpose , include root surface conditioning , bone graft placement , guide tissue regeneration ( GTR ) use enamel matrix-derived protein growth factor . However , current regenerative technique use either alone combination limitation attain complete predicable regeneration , especially advanced periodontal defect , deep intraosseous defect show high-risk site progression periodontitis . According histologic evidence , GTR technique combine bone graft predictable regenerative procedure treatment periodontal defect , although basically , current available GTR-based therapy still crude poor clinical predictability . During periodontal regenerative procedure , remain healthy periodontal ligament ( PDL ) play key role regeneration new compartment , cell PDL tissue cell seem capacity form new attachment apparatus.. The regenerative capacity PDL attribute progenitor cell maintain proliferation differentiation potential periodontium . Recent advance stem cell biology regenerative medicine present opportunity tissue engineering periodontal therapy . To date , large number study report stem cell , conjunction different physical matrix growth factor , capacity regenerate periodontal tissue vivo . It demonstrate PDL-derived progenitor commit several developmental lineage , i.e. , osteoblastic , fibroblastic cementoblastic . This property determine PDL cell desirable cell population capable regenerate functional periodontal attachment apparatus . It show PDL cell may prevent ankylosis root resorption may possibly also produce new PDL insert tooth adjacent bone . Moreover , root cover alveolar bone cell induce cementum-like tissue formation , suggest cementoblast osteoblast precursor commonly originate alveolar bone . Thus , PDL-derived cell source one promise candidate cell-based therapy tissue-engineering-associated periodontal regeneration , positive pre-clinical result already achieve vitro vivo . Taken together , result investigation demonstrate PDL cell capable prevent epithelial down-growth root resorption , periodontal healing pattern characterize connective tissue adaptation involve parallel bundle rest root dentin . The formation new bone cementum vary complete absence coverage part debrided root surface mainly border defect , thin layer newly form cementum complete new bone formation cover entire previously denude root surface . The heterogeneity result obtain may explain small number specimen use , different type periodontal defect observe stability carrier utilize deliver cell ( i.e. , hyaluronic acid blood clot ) . In addition , one may speculate PDL cell differentiation highly sensitive difference microenvironment , result different type periodontal healing . However , clinical application autologous PDL-derived cell currently lack . All world , periodontitis remain highly prevalent , lead loss affect teeth , thus threaten quality life middle-aged population far oral function concern . Unfortunately clinic , current periodontal treatment , best , heal scar affect region ever regenerate lose periodontal tissue normal structure functionality . Considering `` mouth '' `` teeth '' various aesthetic functional role play , establish brand-new treatment enable regeneration periodontal tissue important . It clear clinical need treatment vast patient resource . Interestingly , mount data demonstrates induction periodontal tissue regeneration PDL stem cell animal model . In particular , number study show topical administration PDL stem cell enhance periodontal tissue regeneration model artificial loss periodontal tissue beagles non-human primate . This suggest PDL stem cell may safe effective regeneration periodontal tissue periodontitis patient . In phase I clinical trial 20 healthy male volunteer local administration autologous PDL stem cell , neither adverse reaction rise antibody observe ( unpublished data ) . Importantly , several group commence small-scale pilot/feasibility study , lead sufficient information move cell-based therapy clinical arena . It therefore establish clinical protocol test efficiency safety stem cell treatment periodontal deep intraosseous defect .</detailed_description>
