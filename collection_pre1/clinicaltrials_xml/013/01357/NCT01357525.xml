	<detailed_description>Radiation simulation do Shadyside Radiation Oncology department Contrast-enhanced CT base simulation obtain prior adjuvant treatment ( 2-4 week post-op depend healing ) . The target volume identify base fiducial marker placement time surgery well detailed discussion image review operate surgeon . This contoured axial CT image obtain 1.25 mm slice thickness . These volume reconstruct 3-dimensional image set SBRT planning . Subjects simulate treatment position ( supine arm raise ) CT scanner table appropriate immobilization . OptirayÂ® contrast administer intravenously flow rate 2.5 mL/s . A helical CT scan abdomen acquire intravenous contrast start 30 second prior CT acquisition . A 4D CT data acquisition axial extent obtain . The image electronically transfer CT workstation via DICOM3 appropriate treatment plan workstation department radiation oncology . Based axial CT image , fiducial marker placement , review pathology report , detailed discussion operate surgeon , contour draw clinical target volume ( CTV ) , define area risk microscopic disease . The planning target volume ( PTV ) equivalent CTV unless motion detect 4D motion study . If motion , amount motion superior-inferior , lateral , anterior-posterior direction margin give . Surrounding normal critical structure also contour treat radiation oncologist include kidney , liver , small bowel , spinal cord , stomach necessary . Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Planning An SBRT plan create medical physicist base PTV contour CT scan . The plan deliver fractionate SBRT isodose line best encompass PTV . Careful evaluation plan conduct radiosurgical team ensure normal tissue critical structure tolerance maintain . The maximum dose ( Gy ) within treatment volume ( MD ) , prescription dose ( PD ) , ratio MD/PD ( measure heterogeneity within target volume ) , prescription isodose volume ( PIV mm3 ) , tumor volume ( TV mm3 ) , ratio PIV/TV ( measure dose conformity treatment relative target ) record . Evaluation treatment The subject carefully follow active treatment post-treatment 24 month , death . Treatment follow SBRT All patient see multi-disciplinary pancreatic cancer clinic . As , set medical oncologist . Following completion SBRT describe protocol , patient 's medical oncologist may , his/her discretion , administer systemic therapy accord current standard care UPMC pathway .</detailed_description>
