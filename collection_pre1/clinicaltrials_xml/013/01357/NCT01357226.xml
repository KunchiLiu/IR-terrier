Objective : To compare measurement automate BP device private examination room measurement non-private area primary care office . Design : Randomized controlled trial cross-over . Setting : Community base primary care office participate NorTReN Practice Based Research Network Toronto , Ontario . Participants : Fifty consecutive consenting patient age 18 BP check part routine care . Intervention : Patients randomly allocate either automate BP measurement exam room , non-private area clinic . After test first location subsequently test second location device . Main outcome measure : The primary outcome measure comparison mean systolic value automate BP measurement two office area . The investigator use t-test paired sample . The secondary outcome comparison systolic value patient previously document hypertension .
