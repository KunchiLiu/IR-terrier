	<brief_summary>Newly diagnose diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) patient enter study receive baseline fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan time initial staging . The patient diagnose undergo initial stag accord The Catholic University Lymphoma Group ( CULG ) Protocol . After 1 cycle rituximab plus cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ( R-CHOP ) chemotherapy , early interim FDG PET/CT obtain patient recovers nadir ( usually 13 16 day ) follow administration first cycle R-CHOP , immediately second cycle R-CHOP . The result early interim FDG PET/CT study impact patient management , except rare case newly develop lesion find biopsy confirm . The PET/CT system analysis software use scan baseline surveillance patient enrol study . After 3 cycle R-CHOP , mid-therapy interim FDG PET/CT obtain . Patients newly develop lesion receive different chemotherapy regimen , patient stable disease , partial metabolic response complete metabolic response continue receive 3 cycle R-CHOP . After completion 6 cycle R-CHOP , patient receive FDG PET/CT scan response assessment . Selected patient persistent disease bulky tumor volume initial staging image receive additional radiation therapy . The patient follow every 3 month 2 year begin therapy . Physical examination lab study do usually every 3 month . Imaging study perform every 3 month alternate enhance CT FDG PET/CT note different schedule apply surveillance . The end point change FDG uptake measurement baseline early interim FDG PET/CT , baseline mid-therapy interim FDG PET/CT scan ; response assessment follow completion 6 cycle R-CHOP without radiation therapy assess International Workshop Criteria ( IWC ) +PET PET Response Criteria Solid Tumors ( PERCIST ) guideline ; 2 year disease free survival .</brief_summary>
