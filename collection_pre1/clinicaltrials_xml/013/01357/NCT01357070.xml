	<brief_summary>Atherosclerosis disease process lead harden artery cause become narrowed . This occur fat first deposit inside walls artery , becomes harden fibrous tissue calcium deposition form semi-hardened accumulation material know plaque . As plaque grows , narrow channel within artery cause reduction blood oxygen supply affect organ - heart brain . The investigator understand process cause inflammation activation immune cell period time . It propose target immune cell reduce level immune activation protect cardiovascular disease . Previously observe consumption fruit vegetable rich anti-oxidants confer protective effect cardiovascular disease . The use anti-oxidants experimentally show protective benefit activation . The investigator suggest induce anti-oxidant enzyme indirectly may effective mean provide vascular protection . Sulforaphane , naturally occur compound find green vegetable ( include broccoli , brussel sprout cauliflower ) able protect cell inflammatory stress induce number anti-oxidant molecule . Targeted study consumption broccoli relate vegetable show associate reduce risk coronary artery disease . In present study investigator want test whether consumption `` broccoli smoothie '' contain sulforaphane protect white blood cell become activate presence experimental stress long protective effect last . To , investigator analyse inflammatory change blood sample take different time study .</brief_summary>
