	<brief_summary>Recently , increase data intensity dependent amplitude change ( IDAP : N100 amplitude slope ) auditory evoke Event Related Potential ( ERP ) component role surrogate marker central serotonergic activity . A high N100 amplitude slope reflect low serotonergic neurotransmission vice versa . There couple study report association N1 amplitude slope response Citalopram ( positive correlation ) Reboxetine ( negative correlation ) treatment major depressive disorder patient ( 2,3 ) . The investigator also publish case series SSRI super-sensitivity SSRI induce mania patient aberrantly high N100 slope ( 4 ) . And serotonin transporter gene polymorphism study role pathophysiology bipolar disorder ( 5 , 6 , 7 ) . Serotonin promoter gene know significant relationship N100 amplitude slope ( 8 ) . Furthermore previous study show N100 amplitude slope well correlate hypomanic hyperthymic personality ( 9 ) . Conclusively result , investigator hypothesize depressive patient show aberrant high low N100 amplitude slope ( N100 response outlier ) , response well SSRI medication . They response well quetiapine XR adjunctive therapy . In study , investigator confirm compare treatment effect SSRI monotherapy quetiapine XR adjunctive aberrant N100 responder . Hypothesis First visit depressive patient might monopolar bipolar depression . If depressive patient show aberrantly high low N100 amplitude slope , response SSRI medication . Patients aberrantly high low N100 amplitude slope response well quetiapine XR adjunctive therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Quetiapine XR Depressive Patients Showing Aberrant N100 Amplitude Slope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.2 Rationale study The development well strategy treatment major depressive disorder mood disorder important issue patient , mental health provider government . So far , treatment depressive illness base mainly trial error method physician 's personal experience . So development new strategy predict well treatment response group quetiapine XR would great contribution basic brain science mental health field . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary objective Primary target study prove follow hypothesis : Patients aberrantly high low N100 amplitude slope response well quetiapine XR adjunctive therapy . 2.2 Secondary objective Patients aberrantly high low N100 amplitude slope show high dropout rate SSRI monotherapy compare quetiapine XR adjunctive . 3 . STUDY PLAN AND PROCEDURES 3.1 Overall study design study plan This study conduct open , randomize , two arm , observational phase IV study . The investigator compare treatment response Quetiapine XR SSRIs major depressive disorder patient show aberrant response N100 amplitude slope . The investigator use SSRIs drug ( paxil CR , es-citalopram , fluoxetine , sertraline ) comparator drug . The investigator recruit drug naive patient previous antidepressant medication , washout period require one week . This study conduct single centre study , patient enrol base DSM-IV major depressive disorder criterion , also aberrant response N100 amplitude ( N100 slope &lt; 0.21 , &gt; 1.59 , criterion revise base newly publish data ) . In out-patients status patient recruit together . The treatment duration six week begin pharmacological treatment . Procedure measure LDAEP ( N100 amplitude slope ) Recording take place electrically shield sound attenuate room adjacent record apparatus ( Synamps , Neuroscan ® ) . Subjects seat open eye slightly recline chair head rest . Evoked response record 32 electrode refer Cz . Pure sinus tone ( 1000 Hz , 80 m duration 10 m rise 10 m fall time , ISI randomize 500 900 m ) 5 intensity ( 55 , 65 , 75 , 85 , 95 dB sound pressure level ) present binaurally pseudo-randomised form audiometry headphone . Data collect sample rate 1000 Hz analogous bandpass filter ( 1-30 Hz ) . Analysis perform Scan® software package version 4.3 . One hundred m prestimulus 300 m poststimulus period evaluate 100 sweep every intensity ( together 500 sweep ) . For artifact suppression , trial automatically exclude averaging , voltage exceed ± 70uV one 32 channel time point average period . For subject , remain sweep average separately five stimulus intensity . At least 30 artefact-free sweeps/intensity average . N1 peak ( 80-140 m ) P2 peak ( 100-250 m ) determine semi-automatically Cz electrode ( referred linked-mastoids ) . The IDAP calculate linear regression slope stimulus intensity independent N1/P2 amplitude dependent variable .</detailed_description>
