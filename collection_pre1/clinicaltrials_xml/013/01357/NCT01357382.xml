	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : Current obesity prevention emphasize increase physical activity low-fat , calorie restrict diet produce negative caloric balance . Caloric restriction associate decrease energy expenditure . The mainstay obesity prevention increase level physical activity associate great caloric intake . Failure eat less-exercise strategy evident epidemic obesity , metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) type II diabetes . Moreover , displacement dietary fat diet lead compensatory increase carbohydrate intake associate untoward metabolic effect . Carbohydrate restrict diet controversial despite benefit approach . The controversy stem compensatory increase dietary fat intake associate carbohydrate restriction fear great fat intake increase risk cardiovascular disease . Carbohydrate restriction decrease insulin resistance ameliorates MetS . This protocol aim establish great evidence base carbohydrate restrict diet therapeutic option MetS . The investigator review current knowledge respect : ( ) obesity insulin resistance Canada , ( ii ) position major medical organization ( iii ) shortcomings current obesity prevention paradigm ( iv ) carbohydrate restrict diet work . 1.1 ) Obesity insulin resistance Canada In 1980s low fat , caloric restrict diet become cornerstone dietary advice reduce obesity . This approach successfully reduce percent calorie fat consequential increase carbohydrate consumption . In ensue year , obesity become epidemic . In Canada , prevalence obesity ( BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 ) increase 10 % 1970s 23 % 2004 additional 36 % consider overweight ( BMI 25-29.9 ) . As obesity risk factor MetS type II diabetes , prevalence disorder also reach epidemic proportion . Approximately 2 million Canadians live diabetes 2007 2012 estimate 2.8 million Canadians live diabetes . First Nations community especially hard hit , prevalence 3-4 time higher young age onset non-First Nations individual . Novel chronic disease prevention strategy need address crisis . Insulin resistance underpins pathophysiology obesity , Insulin resistance condition normal amount insulin inadequate produce normal insulin response fat , muscle liver cell . As result , insulin resistant individual elevate blood glucose , fast insulin secrete great amount insulin response dietary carbohydrate . This compensatory hyperinsulinemia associate adverse effect tissue retain sensitivity insulin . Elevated blood glucose level associate advanced glycation end product , reactive oxygen specie low grade inflammation . These exposure associate increase risk cardiovascular disease &amp; diabetes . Despite evidence associate elevate insulin level atherogenic change vasculature , remain matter controversy whether persistently elevate insulin level pathogenic . The diagnosis MetS represent entry-point disease prevention effort individual diabetes cardiovascular disease . MetS define high waist circumference addition two following : high triglyceride , low HDL elevate blood pressure . Other pathophysiologic change also observe include low grade inflammation , increase uric acid , prothrombotic state , elevate ApoB , small dense atherogenic LDL endothelial dysfunction . First line treatment MetS weight loss lead reduction insulin resistance . Intensive lifestyle intervention reduce diabetes high risk subject . Most lifestyle intervention MetS predicate hypothesis individual initiate maintain weight loss restrict calorie increase physical activity . The Diabetes Prevention Program show intensive intervention include low-fat calorie reduce diet increase physical activity associate 1.5 kg/m2 decrease BMI 58 % reduction incidence diabetes individual high risk diabetes . Less intensive intervention associate modest change . A study nutritional counselling associate 0.4 kg/m2 decrease BMI . Thus , lifestyle intervention emphasize 'eating less exercise limited value . The optimal diet subject MetS examine hard end-points . Small trial compare carbohydrate restrict diet low fat diet use surrogate marker . A trial severely obese subject find great weight loss great improvement lipid level hemoglobin A1c carbohydrate restrict diet low fat/calorie restrict diet . In study adult MetS , randomize carbohydrate restriction great weight loss , low triglyceride low insulin level individual calorie restrict , low fat diet . These result consistent meta-analysis carbohydrate restrict diet associated improvement atherogenic dyslipidemia , great weight loss well compliance low fat , calorie restrict diet . These study highlight advantage carbohydrate restriction . 1.2 ) Fat , sugar position major medical organization One principal barrier widespread implementation carbohydrate restrict diet fear increase saturate fat consumption association increase LDL-chol , result great risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . This diet-heart hypothesis form cornerstone dietary advice prevention chronic disease . The avoidance saturate fat lead general avoidance dietary fat . There weak contradictory evidence saturate fat dietary fat restriction associate health benefit . The large test diet-heart hypothesis Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) . This study randomize woman either low saturate fat diet regular diet . After 8 year , woman randomize low fat diet low LDL-chol decrease CVD mortality , incidence breast colorectal cancer . Consistent result WHI , meta-analysis include 347,747 subject find relationship saturate fat intake CVD . While expert would agree 's early vindicate saturate fat foremost dietary evil , evidence accumulate highlight obesigenic atherogenic nature refine carbohydrate . A trial aim decrease sweeten beverage consumption find intervention group 7.7 % less overweight obese child control . In NHANES ( 2006 ) , consumption add sugar associate higher triglyceride low HDL . A prospective study Dutch adult find replace 5 % calorie saturate fat high glycemic carbohydrate associate 33 % increase risk myocardial infarction . The current state scientific confusion health effect ( refine ) carbohydrate reflect diversity dietary recommendation . American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) dietary guideline suggest carbohydrate restrict diet option weight loss 1 year . In contrast , Canadian Diabetes Association recommend diet 45 % -60 % calorie carbohydrate sucrose intake 10 % daily intake . The contradictory nature position highlight need research health effect carbohydrate restrict diet . The endorsement carbohydrate restriction ADA suggest diet valid therapeutic option . 1.3 ) Shortcomings traditional obesity prevention paradigm The current obesity prevention paradigm emphasize caloric reduction and/or increase physical activity produce negative caloric balance . While physical activity establish benefit , increase physical activity weight loss strategy meet disappointing result . Observational study associate high level physical activity lower adiposity difficult interpret individual higher physical activity also benefit ( unmeasured ) health promote behaviour . In randomized trial , physical activity intervention show equivocal result respect weight loss . The physiologic limitation approach difficult augment physical activity without compensatory increase dietary intake . In study physical activity directly supervise absence compensatory increase caloric intake , physical activity associate weight loss &lt; 3 % initial body weight . In physical activity intervention low intensity , result less promising . A meta-analysis school base physical activity intervention youth found effect BMI . The ineffectiveness physical activity mean weight loss reflect American Heart Association American College Sports Sports Medicine position statement recommend 60-90 minute moderate intensity activity/day lose maintain weight loss . Not surprisingly , low prevalence individual moderately active 60-90 minutes/day general population . Ironically , insulin resistant individual would reap great health benefit physical activity may reduce physiologic tolerance insulin resistance associate reduce exercise tolerance reversible change muscle mitochondrion , reduce VO2 max possibly mechanisms . The failure low fat , calorie restrict diet curb prevalence obesity exemplify WHI . After 7.5 year follow-up , woman randomize low fat group decrease weight 0.8 kg 1 cm increase waist circumference despite report decrease caloric intake 360 calorie . Weight loss low fat group different woman control group , consume typical American diet . Calorie restrict diet emphasize avoidance energy dense food high dietary fat . While avoidance dietary fat intuitive appeal , calorie restriction associate corresponding decrease energy expenditure , effect , stimulate starvation response . The compensatory decrease energy expenditure associate plateauing weight loss , increase desire eat weight gain . Low fat/high carbohydrate diet require weight loss produce positive metabolic effect . This dependence weight loss health benefit combine inevitable rebound weight gain associate dietary strategy potential worsen metabolic marker long term . The untoward metabolic change associate high carbohydrate intake particularly deleterious individual MetS . This contrast physiologic effect carbohydrate withdrawal insulin resistant subject mirror reversal MetS . In addition improvement MetS , carbohydrate restrict diet associate less dense therefore less atherogenic LDL particle decrease inflammatory marker . A final limitation current obesity prevention paradigm macronutrients ( fat , protein carbohydrate ) assume equivalent metabolic effect . The investigator review metabolic effect macronutrients relate insulin response energy balance . Carbohydrates potent secretagogues insulin primary regulator adipose tissue metabolism partition dietary energy either storage ( high insulin ) oxidation ( low insulin ) . Mice genetically engineer lack insulin receptor fat cell consume calorie per gram body weight resistant obesity . In type II diabetic , administration exogenous insulin drug stimulate insulin release pancreas associate weight gain . Dietary fat effect insulin secretion delay gastric empty . Dietary protein lower glucose response insulin 2-3 time effectively dietary fat play important role appetite suppression potentially weight regulation . The addition dietary fat , protein fiber dampen untoward effect dietary carbohydrate meal concept behind glycemic index . Low glycemic index diet may less relevance type II diabetic , however , effect dietary fat protein blunt glucose response attenuate absent . If obesity prevention indeed evidence base two tool leave public health arsenal , bariatric surgery carbohydrate restriction . 1.4 ) Why carbohydrate restrict diet work ? There least two physiologic characteristic carbohydrate restrict diet contribute weight loss . First , ad lib carbohydrate restrict diet associate spontaneous reduction caloric intake . Second , diet associate great weight loss per calorie low-fat diet unexplained caloric deficit 200 kcal/day . The preferential weight loss carbohydrate restrict diet term 'the metabolic advantage ' . The concept metabolic advantage associate carbohydrate restrict diet controversial among expert . While evidence support existence animal model human , phenomenon remain poorly understood . Ad lib carbohydrate restrict diet often associate spontaneous decrease caloric intake . This caused insulin lower effect carbohydrate restrict diet high insulin level associate partition metabolic fuel adipose tissue great food intake . A trial obese subject find consume carbohydrate restrict diet nearly 30 % decrease fast insulin level 570 kcal decrease energy intake . Thus low insulin level key mediator lower carbohydrate consumption weight loss . A study men find 70 % variability weight loss carbohydrate restrict diet explain change fast insulin . A number trial show metabolic advantage carbohydrate restrict diet compare low fat diet . There three possible explanation . First , might great energetic cost associate metabolic interconversions nutrient carbohydrate restrict diet . Second , individual low carbohydrate diet may higher energy expenditure due great rest metabolic rate and/or great level physical activity . A final possibility low weight loss due selective under-reporting dietary intake individual randomize low fat diet . This latter explanation likely find observe numerous randomize controlled trial . Diet induce thermogenesis may small contribution metabolic advantage carbohydrate restrict diet . It account 5-15 % total energy expenditure . The energetic cost metabolize macronutrients vary 2.5 % dietary fat , 7-15 % carbohydrate 28-35 % protein . One study find energy expenditure 4 % high diet contain 30 % compare 10 % calorie protein . Thus modest increase energy expenditure due high protein intake would likely enough account metabolic advantage carbohydrate restrict diet . Physical activity great modifiable source energy expenditure . The hypothesis metabolic advantage carbohydrate restrict diet could explain low insulin level associate spontaneous increase physical activity receive scant attention . This hypothesis base number well establish observation . First , type II diabetic take exogenous insulin decrease energy expenditure weight gain . When insulin level lower carbohydrate restriction pharmacotherapy attendant loss fat mass evidence modest increase energy expenditure . A short study obese individual find ketogenic , low carbohydrate diet 30 % decrease insulin resistance associate 20 % increase rest energy-expenditure , though physical activity assess study . Similarly , 6 month randomize trial obese woman , carbohydrate restrict diet non-significant 5 % increase rest energy expenditure per kg body weight compare baseline . This study also assess physical activity use pedometer find difference steps/day carbohydrate restrict group low-fat group despite 3.7kg great weight loss former difference report caloric intake group . Measurement physical activity free-living individual complex . Pedometers objective assessment physical activity unable ass intensity , frequency duration activity . They also unsuitable estimation energy expenditure . In summary , intensive lifestyle intervention reduce incidence type II diabetes individual metabolic syndrome . Central therapeutic effect intervention weight loss . There lack consensus constitute 'best practice ' lifestyle intervention . Physical activity associate numerous health benefit efficacious prescription weight loss weight maintenance . Moreover , optimal dietary prescription controversial ; expert suggest individual MetS restrict dietary fat intake expert suggest dietary carbohydrate restrict . This controversy dietary prescription reflect position major medical organization . The American Diabetes Association endorse carbohydrate restriction weight loss since 2008 . The Canadian Diabetes Association , however , favour low glycemic index food restriction dietary fat . Despite equivocal evidence , low fat , calorie restrict diet couple increased physical activity consider standard lifestyle intervention MetS . 2 . OBJECTIVES This protocol three aim . First , investigator hypothesize adherence low carbohydrate diet individual MetS , result low insulin resistance ; cause increase level spontaneous physical activity , independent change weight . Second , investigator examine change cardiometabolic risk factor ( ApoB , TG , HDL , blood pressure , CRP ) individual randomize either carbohydrate restrict diet low fat/high carbohydrate diet . Finally , investigator interview sub-sample participant study arm ( 5 arm ) conduct open-ended interview well understand quality life issue respect dietary assignment lifestyle intervention . 3 . RESEARCH PLAN Our group generate cross-sectional data show clinically meaningful association high carbohydrate intake low physical activity , assess accelerometer glucose intolerant individual . The limitation finding relate inability ass causality ; , carbohydrate restriction cause increase physical activity . The strength ACTout study ability delineate causal direction use prospective design randomization control know unknown confounders . Study design participant : Study participant randomize ad lib carbohydrate restrict group low fat , calorie reduce diet 6 month . The investigator recruit individual metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) St. Paul 's Metabolic Syndrome Program . Inclusion criterion include diagnosis MetS define increased waist circumference two following : fasting blood sugar great 5.6 mmol/L , fast triglyceride great 1.7 mmol/L , high density lipoprotein ( HDL ) less 1.0 mmol/L men le 1.3 mmol/L woman blood pressure great 135/85 antihypertensive medication . Potential participant exclude follow weight reduce diet , abuse alcohol psychoactive substance , psychiatric medication associate weight gain plan travel study period . Sample size calculation : To calculate sample size investigator use cross-sectional data accelerometer measure physical activity excellent quantitative measure diet . The investigator assume 15 % difference calorie consume carbohydrate dietary treatment . With significance value p &lt; 0.05 ( two side test ) investigator find 27 participant would require group detect significant difference accelerometer measure intensity activity . To account possible attrition investigator overestimate sample size 10 arm . The investigator recruit 72 individual 36 arm . Based sample size calculation , investigator expect detect time diet base difference addition diet*time interaction . Recruitment strategy : The investigator recruit individual metabolic syndrome Metabolic Syndrome Program . Flyers post wait room examination room Program . Flyers also give administrative assistant responsible intake participant Program may choose notify participant study . If potential participant express interest coordinator explain study sufficient detail enable informed consent . To assess diet prior inclusion study investigator ask potential participant complete 3 day diet history wear accelerometer 7 day ensure already follow weight reduce diet assess baseline physical activity . Individuals compliant dietary recall baseline assessment physical activity randomize one two dietary assignment . Randomization : The investigator use block randomization prevent bias randomization process . After block subject enrol , investigator use computerized randomization program randomly assign participant one two dietary assignment . Due difficulty conceal dietary assignment , randomize trial blind ; researcher participant aware dietary assignment . To minimize contamination study group , individual group session schedule different time . Carbohydrate restrict diet : Participants instruct restrict carbohydrate consumption &lt; 20 grams/day restrict caloric intake . Participants encourage consume vegetable low carbohydrate content every day include 2 cup salad green 1 cup vegetable 'that grow ground ' . One physiologic change associate low carbohydrate intake loss salt urine . If salt replace participant may experience headache , nausea , dizziness , lethargy constipation . Participants counsel increase salt intake . This show correct natiuresis associate carbohydrate restriction cause aforementioned side effect . Participants advise continue baseline level physical activity . Control group : The control group randomize intensive lifestyle intervention currently use Healthy Heart Program St. Paul 's Hospital reduce symptom associate metabolic syndrome . Participants instruct replace high fat , energy dense food food rich whole grain , fruit vegetable . The macronutrient distribution diet approximately 55 % carbohydrate , 15 % protein 30 % fat . Individuals also instruct reduce sodium intake &lt; 2300 mg/day individual hypertension , &lt; 1500 mg/day . At end study , participant option continue either study diet . Methods ensure compliance dietary assignment : The study coordinator facilitate activity support compliance dietary assignment , either one-on-one group set . Group meeting reinforce compliance share cook tip , behaviour modification relapse prevention strategy . In one-on-one session , study coordinator review 3 day food record discus strategy increase compliance . Participants group meet clinician 3 month assess health indicator assure participant safety dietary assignment . Qualitative interview : The investigator conduct hour long open-ended interview 8-10 participant study understand live experience prudent diet carbohydrate restrict diet . Interviews record transcribed . The investigator use grounded theory look theory emerge data oppose interpret data priori analysis . The investigator assign descriptive category theme emerge data , theme could include : effect diet diabetes , perception hunger , mood etc . These descriptive category place thematic category analyze light exist literature . Measurement body composition estimation rest energy expenditure : The investigator use bioelectrical impedance ass body composition baseline 6 month . Bioelectrical impedance show provide reasonable assessment body composition compare DXA , consider gold standard . The investigator normalize fat mass fat-free mass height use fat-mass index fat-free mass index ( kg/m2 ) , respectively . Height measure stadiometer baseline . Waist circumference assess baseline 6 month , exhalation , use flexible tape measure half way hip bone low rib . The investigator estimate energy expenditure use previously publish equation take account fat-free mass , fat mass , gender age . Questionnaire : The investigator use Applied Health Indicators Questionnaire Patient Health Questionnaire , collect relevant health information patient . These self-administered questionnaire complete baseline , 3 6 month . Physical activity assessment : Participants wear accelerometer assess physical activity baseline week every month 6 month . An accelerometer small electronic monitor worn waist measure vertical acceleration thus consider objective measure physical activity . Patients instruct wear accelerometer wake hour 1 week every month , exclusive time spend bathing water . Data download one-minute epochs categorize light , moderate vigorous activity . Days exclude accelerometer worn le 80 % average time worn day . The investigator estimate activity-based energy expenditure use previously validate equation . As accelerometer capture activity associate cycling , swim ski investigator ask participant number time activity period wore accelerometer . Cardiometabolic index : Blood sample draw place individually label tube EDTA , centrifuge immediately store -70°C . As change insulin action central hypothesis investigator assess two distinct aspect insulin metabolism study , insulin secretion insulin resistance . The investigator assess insulin resistance use HOMA assessment insulin resistance calculate fasting insulin fast glucose . The investigator assess concentration C-peptide , cleavage product relate insulin synthesis synthesize equimolar concentration insulin . As C-peptide long half-life insulin , use marker insulin secretion pancreas . Blood Pressure assess baseline , 3 6 month use BP-TRU monitor . Lipid , lipoprotein C-reactive protein level measure baseline , 3 6 month . Total cholesterol , triglyceride , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol apolipoprotein B measure use previously describe method . LDL-chol level calculate use Friedewald formula patient whose plasma triglyceride level less 4 mmol/L . β-hydroxybutyrate also assess group aforementioned time point use biomarker adherence carbohydrate restrict diet . The investigator also assess serum Leptin uric acid baseline 6 month . Statistical analysis : The investigator use two different approach analyze data . First investigator use intention treat analysis use baseline value impute miss data participant may drop-out study . The investigator also examine effect dietary assignment outcomes participant compliant dietary assignment . Baseline characteristic compare two group use test . The investigator examine three inter-related dependent variable , capture different aspect physical activity , analysis strategy . First , investigator examine association dietary assignment change accelerometer variable . The investigator also examine time spend moderate-to-vigorous physical activity activity base energy expenditure . As activity base energy estimate accelerometer , investigator consider unique comparison . The investigator thus set level statistical significance p &lt; 0.025 adjust multiple comparison . The investigator obtain difference key variable physical activity change insulin concentration . To assess effect dietary assignment physical activity , investigator use three-way repeated-measures ANOVA , include change body weight model time repeat factor .</detailed_description>
