	<brief_summary>This non-invasive study use standard doppler echocardiographic transducer record signal emanate lung ( TPD ) . These signal cause pulsation blood vessel lung tissue . The innovation study : 1 . The software processing reflect ultra-sound wave lung render reproducible , clear strong signal sync cardiac cycle , 2 . The observation base pilot study blow hard resistance recording ( something call Valsalva maneuver ) , affect lung signal weaken even obliterate pressure rise . The investigator hypothesis since signal come blood vessel lung , pressure record signal disappears Valsalva maneuver represent blood pressure lung .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current method noninvasive measurement pulmonary arterial blood pressure standard echo-doppler equipment fraught uncertainty . So much patient screen followed pulmonary arterial hypertension require right heart catheterization . An invasive uncomfortable potentially dangerous procedure . This study design confirm preliminary observation good correlation Valsalva maneuver pressure pulmonary arterial blood pressure . Sixty patient undergo right heart catheterization clinical reason study . The study short , 30 minute , painless do patient either sit bed semi-reclining . The probe position right chest wall patient request successively blow mouthpiece rise pressure , tolerance . The result obtain use TPD ass pulmonary arterial pressure compare result obtain catheterization . This part development phase technology .</detailed_description>
