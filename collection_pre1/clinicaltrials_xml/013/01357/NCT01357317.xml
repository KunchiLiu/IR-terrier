	<brief_summary>Objective : To examine effect three commonly apply treatment disorder phosphorus homeostasis biochemical marker vascular characteristic patient moderate advance non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Effects Lanthanum Carbonate Versus Calcium Acetate Versus Dietary Phosphorus Restriction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 120 qualified patient medical center , diagnose mild moderate chronic kidney disease ( estimate GFR 15-60 ml/min ) , enrol . After informed consent , qualified subject randomize 3 arm 1:1:1 ratio : lanthanum carbonate , calcium acetate , dietary modification . The maximum length treatment 12 month . Dose intervention adjust base change biochemical parameter . Primary end point change serum phosphorus , urine phosphorus , serum parathyroid hormone , coronary artery calcification , aortic pulse velocity flow mediate vasodilation .</detailed_description>

Serum phosphorus &gt; 4.6 mg/dl plasma intact PTH ( iPTH ) level 65 pg/ml tubular reabsorption phosphorus ( TRP ) &lt; 80 % . A negative pregnancy test prior enrollment female patient , unless patient 2 year postmenopausal , document tubal ligation total hysterectomy . Patients need phosphorus binder 4 week prior screen Stable dose vitamin D product 4 week patient receive agent . Dose change patient receive stable initiation vitamin D product patient previously treat permit study Women pregnant , capable become pregnant participate acceptable form birth control , breast feeding Patients currently participate clinical trial another investigational drug device receive investigational drug device within 30 day enrollment study Major surgery within 2 month prior enrollment study plan surgery patient study , dialysis vascular access surgery . Presence coronary stent , artificial heart valves pacemaker , history CABG Patients active infection require ongoing treatment Patients malignancy ( except nonmelanoma cancer skin ) unless patient receive curative treatment disease free &gt; 2 year Patient Investigator determine medical status would preclude patient 's participation study Patients hemodialysis ( HD ) peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) Patients functional renal transplant Patients allergy study drug Patients serum calcium &gt; 10.7 mg/dl .</criteria>
