	<brief_summary>This exploratory proof concept study conduct patient stable New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II-III heart failure . The focus efficacy endpoint test hypothesis GSK716155 administration increase glucose uptake utilization myocardium , result increase myocardial efficiency increase exercise capacity . A positive result , define either statistically significant effect one efficacy endpoints overall signal suggesting clinically relevant effect myocardial physiology , would provide evidence potential progression development chronic heart failure population .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Chronic dilate cardiomyopathy ischemic nonischemic origin Clinically stable optimal therapy least 3 month prior screening/baseline visit . Left ventricular ejection fraction great equal 40 % assessed measurement previous 24 month . NYHA Class II/III heart failure minimum 6 month prior enrolment Male female 21 75 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . However optimal age range study 40 65 year age . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) &gt; 40 MlU/ml estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml ( &lt; 140 pmol/L ) confirmatory ] . Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method list Section 8.1 appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception followup visit ~28 day postlast dose . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Confirmed QTcB QTcF &lt; 480 msec ; QTc &lt; 500 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . AST ALT &lt; 2xULN ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin great equal 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Subjects must able perform performance/exercise test A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Active ischemia manifest history myocardial infarction unstable angina past 12 month history coronary revascularization ( percutaneous coronary intervention and/or coronary artery bypass graft ) past 6 month . . High suspicion active myocardial ischemia , opinion treat physician A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen History drug/alcohol abuse . A positive test HIV antibody . Calcitonin &gt; 100 pg./mL Triglycerides &gt; 850 mg/dL History significant gastrointestinal surgery , include gastric bypass banding , antrectomy , RouxenY bypass , gastric vagotomy , small bowel resection , surgery think significantly affect upper gastrointestinal function . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : For UK : average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit male &gt; 14 unit female . One unit equivalent 8 g alcohol : halfpint ( ~240 ml ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 ml ) wine 1 ( 25 ml ) measure spirit . For US : average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 g alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360 ml ) beer , 5 ounce ( 150 ml ) wine 1.5 ounce ( 45 ml ) 80 proof distil spirit . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Known allergy history sensitivity albiglutide , GLP1 analogue , , Baker 's yeast . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Pregnant female determine positive serum urine hCG test screen prior dosing . Lactating female . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol ( e.g.. relate psychiatric disorder ) Subject mentally legally incapacitate . Known diagnosis diabetes mellitus , fast glucose &gt; 140mg/dL , HbA1c &gt; 7 % . Uncorrected thyroid disease manifest abnormal thyroidstimulating hormone ( TSH ) ( outside reference range screen ) . Other medical problem life expectancy less 1yr . Other cause cardiomyopathy leave ventricular dysfunction include : Uncorrected primary obstructive regurgitant valvular disease Restrictive cardiomyopathy due amyloidosis , hemochromatosis , sarcoidosis cause Cardiac hypertrophy wall thickness &gt; 1.5cm Alcoholinduced cardiomyopathy Women heart failure 12 month follow childbirth . Complex congenital heart disease Anthracycline induce cardiomyopathy Subjects genetic disorder skeletal muscle ( e.g . Duchenne muscular dystrophy ) Clinically significant pericardial disease . Listed status 1A 1B heart transplant wait list . History deep vein thrombosis know coagulation disorder History pancreatitis History family history medullary thyroid carcinoma History family history multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 History renal dysfunction estimate GFR &lt; 40 ml/min screen Resting systolic blood pressure &lt; 85 mmHg &gt; 170 mmHg ; diastolic blood pressure &gt; 110 mgHg screening . Inability patient lie flat combine total 4 hour complete image assessment . No subject enrol single site perform CMR substudy contraindication MRI scan include , limited : Intracranial aneurysm clip appropriate operative conformation History intra orbital metal fragment Pacemakers nonMR compatible heart valves Inner ear implant History claustrophobia deem significant investigator</criteria>
