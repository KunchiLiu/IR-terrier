	<brief_summary>The goal observational study develop validate predictive score 1-year outcome subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) patient receive aneurism coil . Using database fill prospectively , investigator plan collect clinical , biological radiological admission characteristic coil SAH case 1-year Rankin outcome score 5 year ( 2003-2007 ) .

	<brief_title>Admission Bio-clinical Score Predict One-year Outcomes Coiled Subarachnoid Hemorrhage ( SAH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan screen patient consecutively admit January 1 , 2003 neurosurgical intensive care unit clinical diagnosis SAH confirm cerebral angiography treat coiling procedure . Patients decision make treat physician either forego invasive treatment perform open surgical clipping exclude . Clinical , biological radiological characteristic record course hospitalization . This observational study perform accord standard procedure . Admission characteristic . At admission , investigator plan anonymously record age , sex , GCS , presence motor deficit , presence clinical seizure WFNS score . The GCS refers value admission treatment sedative drug . The cohort divide two group , admission coma group patient GCS &lt; 13 ( WFNS 4 5 ) , non-coma group patient GCS313 ( WFNS 1 3 ) . Admission biological sample venous blood routinely perform measure S100beta troponin per standard clinical practice ICU . Troponin I S100beta level consider high value higher 0.5 mg/L ( correspond 5 time maximum normal range ) consistent previous study ensure high specificity . Admission radiological characteristic obtain admission CT-scan initial angiogram . The CT-scan review neuro-radiologist classified accord modify Fisher score . Hydrocephalus intraventricular hemorrhage admission also register . Aneurysm site number aneurysm obtain initial angiogram . ICU Management . The ICU management modify study . Briefly , central venous line arterial catheter routinely inserted admission coiling . An external ventricular drain ( EVD ) insert patient CT evidence hydrocephalus , WFNS grade III V , transcranial Doppler pulsatility index great 1.2 , suggestive increase intracranial pressure . The EVD routinely connect external pressure strain gauge monitor ICP accord recently publish protocol . After coil , systolic arterial blood pressure maintain 130 150 mm Hg titration IV norepinephrine . ICP elevation high 20 mm Hg treat cerebra-spinal fluid drainage , increase minute volume mechanical ventilation already implement , deepen sedation , rarely , moderate hypothermia ( target core temperature 35.5 36.5Â°C ) . An additional CT perform whenever clinical status deteriorate . Acetaminophen insulin use need avoid hyperthermia hyperglycemia , respectively . For ventilated patient , arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure ( PaCO2 ) maintain 35 40 mm Hg peripheral oxygen saturation ( SPO2 ) 97 % , deem possible . Oral enteral nutrition start soon possible . All patient receive seizure prophylaxis admission . Cerebral Vasospasm management strategy . The investigator use standard strategy cerebral vasospasm management . To summarize , patient receive IV nimodipine 2 mg/hr admission end second week admission , except period uncontrolled hypoxia ICP elevation . Patients switch oral nimodipine ( 60 mg orally every 4 hr ) time ICU discharge ward , total treatment period 21 day . The neurologic hemodynamic status assess least every 4 hour . TCD perform least day first 10 day . In unsedated patient , event clinical deterioration , new symptom ( uncontrolled cephalalgia , confusion , seizure , motor deficit ) , mean TCD velocity 120 cm/s great 50 cm/s change mean TCD velocity ( ref ) increase S100 ( , cerebral angiogram perform . As standard practice , cerebral angiogram perform CT-scan ruled complication . In sedated patient , since clinical symptom able assess ; TCD S100 ( criterion use evaluate need cerebral angiogram . Each vasospasm episode treat intra-arterial nimodipine administration , follow intra-arterial milrinone 2 mg necessary ( ref ) , repeat day necessary . Mechanical angioplasty use second-line treatment necessary . Additionally , hypertensive therapy reinforce target SBP 160 180 mm Hg . Occurrences vasospasm ischemic vasospasm ( neurological symptom directly link artery spasm ) record . Clinical Outcome . The primary outcome systematically assess use Rankin outcome scale ICU-discharge 6 month 1 year later . The GCS , WFNS , Fisher score compare new score prediction 1-year mortality 1-year full recovery ( define Rankin 0 1 ) . Statistical Analysis . To identify factor independently predict 1-year mortality , multivariable analysis perform use backward stepwise logistic regression enter variable yield p &lt; 0.05 univariate analysis . The investigator use approximation odds ratio significant value stepwise logistic regression construct new score . The investigator construct receiver operating characteristic ( ROC ) curve score compare area ROC curve ( AUC ) ABC , WFNS , GCS Fisher score predict 1-year mortality 1-year full recovery ( define Rankin score 0-1 ) . Statistical analysis perform use STATA version 11 ( StataCorp , Texas , USA ) .</detailed_description>
