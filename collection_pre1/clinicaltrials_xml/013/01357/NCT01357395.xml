	<brief_title>A Phase 2 , Open-Label Study Amuvatinib Combination With Platinum-Etoposide Chemotherapy Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amuvatinib oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor inhibits mutant form c-Kit PDGFR alpha . It also disrupt DNA repair likely suppression Homologous Recombination protein Rad51 . In Phase 1b clinical study combination VP-16 carboplatin , responses SCLC observe . In vitro vivo data demonstrate amuvatinib synergy VP-16 thereby support combination continue evaluation clinical trial . Pharmacokinetic data Phase 1 clinical trial suggest co-administration amuvatinib alter exposures standard care agent VP-16 carboplatin measure overall exposure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female ≥ 18 age time consent histologically cytologically confirm SCLC 2 . Measurable SCLC per RECIST guideline meet one following : Disease progression RECIST anytime platinumetoposide ( PE ) chemotherapy ; Relapse RECIST within 90 day complete PE chemotherapy ; Stable disease RECIST best response least two ( 2 ) ≥ 21day cycle PE chemotherapy . The assessment stable disease make least 2 week start second cycle Subjects receive another secondline therapy eligible still fulfill one three condition , eligibility criterion 3 . Start treatment last regimen ( dose schedule ) firstline PE chemotherapy progress relapse , include dose reduction toxicity , prior study entry 4 . ECOG performance status 0 2 5 . Adequate organ function 6 . Subjects screen 12lead ECG measurable QTc interval &lt; 450 msec . If QTc ≥ 450 msec , confirm read evaluate mean QTc interval triplicate ECGs . 7 . Sign approve informed consent form 1 . Prior exposure amuvatinib 2 . No longer eligible firstline PE chemotherapy due toxicity Investigator believe risk retreat PE chemotherapy regimen would outweigh benefit 3 . Ongoing toxicity prior treatment unless toxicity resolve , opinion Investigator , stable compromise safety subject 4 . Mixed SCLC nonsmall cell lung cancer , large cell lung cancer 5 . Untreated , unstable , symptomatic brain metastasis 6 . Hypersensitivity amuvatinib , excipients amuvatinib , agent give association trial 7 . A lifethreatening illness , medical condition organ system dysfunction , Investigator 's opinion , could compromise subject 's safety interfere study outcome</criteria>
