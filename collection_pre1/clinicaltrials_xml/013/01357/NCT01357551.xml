	<detailed_description>Obesity second lead cause preventable death United States associate wide range disease . In people obese , weight loss improve blood pressure , dyslipidemia , glycemia , arthritis symptom ; reduces medication use several disease process ; increase physical functioning ; enhance health-related quality life . Despite benefit , patient achieve weight loss regain much weight within year , effective behavioral weight maintenance intervention identify . Thus , dire need effective intervention promote weight loss maintenance . Theoretical empirical study indicate behavior maintenance distinct state involve different psychological process behavioral skill initial behavior change . The trial test weight loss maintenance intervention take distinction account , may partially explain modest finding . The current study evaluate efficacy theoretically inform maintenance intervention compare usual care . If efficacious , intervention could reduce need future clinic visit treat obesity many associate illness could serve model redesign MOVE ! program . This 3.5-year study involve two-arm , randomize , control trial . During run-in phase , Veterans BMI 30 kg/m2 participate 4-month , intensive , group-based weight loss program . Participants lose least 4 kg end 4 month ( n=222 ) randomize receive ( ) usual care ( n=112 ) 56 week ( b ) theoretically-informed maintenance intervention ( n=110 ) 42 week month , follow 14 week intervention contact examine sustainability . The maintenance intervention involve in-person group visit transition individualize telephone call , frequency contact interventionist gradually tapered time . Outcomes assessed randomization week 14 , 26 , 42 , 56 post-randomization . The hypothesis maintenance intervention result least 3.5 kg great weight loss great improvement caloric intake physical activity study period , cost-effective , compare usual care .</detailed_description>
