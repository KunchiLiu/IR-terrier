There limit number previous line therapy . For Phase 1b Phase 2 : Have measurable disease nonmeasurable disease , define accord Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Have give write informed consent prior studyspecific procedure Have adequate organ function include : Hematologic : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1.5 x 10^9/L , platelet great equal 100 x 10^9/L , hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL . Hepatic : bilirubin le equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) less equal 2.5 time ULN . If liver tumor involvement , AST le equal 5 time ULN ALT less equal 5 time ULN acceptable . Patients may endoscopic radiologic stenting treat biliary obstruction . If , bilirubin must return less equal 1.5 time ULN ALP , AST , ALT le equal 5 time ULN prior enrollment . Renal : serum creatinine within normal limit , less equal 1.5 time ULN . Have performance status less equal 2 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale Patients must recover Grade 3/4 toxicity previous therapy Are reliable willing make available duration study willing follow study procedure Prior radiation therapy treatment cancer allow &lt; 25 % bone marrow , patient must recover acute toxic effect treatment prior study enrollment .
