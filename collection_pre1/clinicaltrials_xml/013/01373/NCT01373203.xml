	<brief_summary>The important character acute lung injury ( ALI ) alveolar capillary membrane damage cause different disease , sepsis , trauma shock . One important pathological stage vary degree interstitial fibrosis semi-permeable alveolar membrane fibrosis . It prove CXCL12/SDF-1 ( stromal cell-derived factor-1 ) induce fibrocyte migration , promote fibrosis progression . Study indicate inhibition TLR4 receptor signal pathway improve fibrosis progression induce ALI , however , role fibrocyte ALI still unclear . The fibrocytes significantly increase asthmatic patient pulmonary fibrosis , company increase CTGF expression . Therefore , project assume fibrocyte differentiation fibroblast/myofibroblast patient acute lung injury , turn lead progression fibrosis . The central hypothesis project peripheral progenitor cell fibrocytes play important role alveolitis cause acute lung injury . The overall objective project study role fibrocytes acute lung injury .</brief_summary>
