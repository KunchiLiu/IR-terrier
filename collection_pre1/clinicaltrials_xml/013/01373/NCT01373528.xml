	<brief_summary>Chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) complex inflammatory disease treat primarily sinus surgery long-term use topical steroid therapy . Budesonide irrigation common method topical steroid treatment patient . However , effect budesonide irrigation hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis patient CRS follow sinus surgery , yet define . The objective study determine topical sinonasal budesonide steroid irrigation lead acute recoverable and/or long-term suppression HPA axis . Participants prospective cohort study CRS recently undergo endoscopic sinus surgery . They also plan use budesonide irrigation postoperative medical treatment . The acute effect treatment HPA axis evaluate use serial serum cortisol measurement day day first budesonide irrigation . The long-term effect sinonasal budesonide irrigation evaluate use pre- post-treatment adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) stimulation test well repeat urine free cortisol level length study . The result determine need additional steroid patient stop treatment physiologic stressful event .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CRS inflammatory disease paranasal sinuses difficult treat . Current treatment strategy rely upon medical treatment long-term daily use topical corticosteroid foundation . Once medical therapy become ineffective control CRS resultant symptom , surgical treatment offer . Following surgery , patient must continue medical treatment control inflammation present CRS . Previously , topical steroid could apply use commercially prepared applicator effective treat front nose part paranasal sinus . However , relatively new nasal saline irrigation device make possible treat paranasal sinus . Corticosteroid medication add directly saline irrigation . In operated patient sinus opening greatly enlarge allows irrigation effectively reach paranasal sinus . Therefore , irrigation corticosteroid solution allow good delivery corticosteroid medication treat mucosal inflammation widely present . More effective treatment paranasal sinus inflammation thereby lead improved control inflammation alleviation patient symptom chronic facial dental pain , headache , obstruct nasal breathing , loss smell discharge nose . As yet , method treatment determine whether significant systemic absorption resultant suppression HPA axis . The investigator hypothesize : 1. single 0.5 mg dose budesonide result acute recoverable suppression pituitary adrenocorticotrophic hormone ( ACTH ) secretion resultant transient decrease adrenal cortisol production ; 2. long term use budesonide , 0.5 mg twice daily ( BID ) , result gradual cumulative suppression HPA axis extent significant hypocortisolism present budesonide irrigation discontinue necessitating replacement glucocorticoid therapy . Specific Aim Project This study determine acute recoverable long-term suppression HPA axis budesonide irrigation use patient CRS follow endoscopic sinus surgery . This important information currently available literature .</detailed_description>
