	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether interactive exercise videogame bike effective improve physical activity adherence , motivation physical activity , physical fitness among family . Families receive either interactive videogame bike game console , traditional stationary bike place front television , keep home six month . It expect family within videogame bike condition show great exercise adherence . It also expect family higher self-reported physical activity level , great motivation physical activity , improve cardiovascular fitness end three month period compare family stationary bike condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Short title : Fit Game : Fitness &amp; Game Bike Adherence , Motivation Exercise Study Study period : 3 year Clinical phase : Phase III trial Background : Cancer significant economic burden Canada , direct cost health-care system ( e.g. , care rehabilitation relate disease ) indirectly lose economic output ( e.g. , missed work due illness , premature death ) . At least half new cancer case death worldwide prevent , thus imperative primary prevention become focus research . Recent research suggest strong relationship physical activity many prevalent form cancer include breast , lung , colon cancer ( i.e. , individual exercise less likely develop cancer ) . Despite finding , half Canadian population fail meet level physical activity recommend preventative measure . Additionally , find large decline physical activity occur early life ; thus , promotion effort target critical transition physical inactivity early life paramount . Findings Canadian Community Health Survey note 21 % Canadian youth accumulate enough daily activity meet international guideline optimal growth development . As well , national cross-sectional cohort study physical inactivity/overweight prevalence demonstrate prominent deflection point age 25 35 , link convincingly demand parenthood . Thus , two important target group disease prevention parent child family-based physical activity initiative . Unfortunately , intervention type limited result little change physical activity . Previous study focus heavily education benefits/barriers physical activity , follow self-monitoring self-regulatory ( e.g. , goal-setting ) component . One area overlook try increase physical activity participation among youth , despite reliable robust association physical activity , modification affective expectation judgement ( expect pleasure enjoyment ) . The introduction new , enjoyable , engage exercise activity may present novel approach increase physical activity . One group activity potential interactive exercise video game include game Game Bike system , Sony PlayStation EyeToy , Nintendo Wii . These game allow player interact physically ( use leg , arm , whole-body movement ) response on-screen virtual activity provide control opportunity physical activity exercise family environment . Emerging evidence suggest game significantly increase energy expenditure similar moderate vigorous intensity physical activity translate health-related fitness improvement . Our systematic review exist active video game intervention highlight potential approach increase physical activity child young people . Additionally , previous research game also demonstrate health-related fitness gain even compare standard cycling condition . Despite positive effect , little information present understand adherence exercise videogames ( EV ) . Our research university-aged male show intervention group use interactive Game bike attend 30 % session control group use traditional stationary exercise bike . Even few study EV evaluate motivational property game potential reason improve adherence control physical activity condition . Only two study measure psychological construct examine effect EV motivation . Results previous work suggest EV effectively change affective judgment physical activity subsequent behaviour unlike prior intervention effort . Despite early positive finding , EV research notable limitation . First , population employ EV research limit convenience sample male undergraduate student . Research need expand sample order examine reach EV . Second , EV research almost exclusively conducted laboratory set . While helpful initial pilot/efficacy phase research , EV research need conduct ecologically valid location . The family home seem excellent test whether EVs still affect psychological , behavioural , fitness outcomes situate naturalistic location leisure-time stimulus . Finally , length EV trial limit six-week longitudinal test single exposure examination . Trials long duration would helpful examine continue interest EV subsequent adherence . It may EV provide powerful novel experience short term wane similar exercise initiative across time . Our propose study overcome past limitation advance current knowledge EV . Objectives : The primary objective study evaluate effect interactive exercise video bike ( i.e. , Active Cycle ) comparison stationary bike ( Active Cycle without videogame controller ) front TV physical fitness , use bike , perception bike . We also explore whether season ( winter/summer ) , age ( parents/kids ) gender ( males/females ) affect use various bike . Study population : The targeted population inactive family within Greater Victoria Area , British Columbia Greater Halifax Area , Nova Scotia , Canada . Number subject : A total 160 family recruit ( n=80 per group ) . 120 family recruit Greater Victoria site . The remainder recruit Greater Halifax . Each family EV-interactive condition receive videogame bike ( Hogan Health Industries , West Jordan , Utah ) link family 's Sony Playstation 2 3® ( Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc , Foster City , California ) . If family Sony Playstation 2 3® provide duration intervention . Families choose five videogames variety Sony Playstation 2 3® videogames . At 3 month , family give opportunity select five new videogames , wish . Each family control group receive traditional stationary bike ( i.e. , Active Cycle without videogame controller ) place front television . Statistical method : Study power : A sample size 160 family ( 80 per group ) recruit detect small-medium effect size ( f2 = .10 ) adherence physical activity ( primary outcome ) type one error .05 , average correlation .75 across time dependent variable ( DV ) interest , power .80 . Our sample size also consider main 2 ( group ) x 2 ( parent/child ) x 4 ( time ) repeat measure design potential 15 % attrition rate . The prediction-based research examine group condition well via collapse sample mediation analysis . Considering average 5 predictor independent variable ( Theory Planned Behavior ( TPB ) Self-Determination Theory ( SDT ) model ) , use small-medium effect size ( f2 = .10 ) sufficient power ( .80 ) evaluate predictor alpha .05 . Statistical analysis : Intention treat analysis use evaluate main treatment effect . Missing data primary outcome measure impute use pre-specified approach . Research question 1 analyze use 2 ( condition ) x 4 ( time ) repeat measure factorial ANOVA primary outcome child adherence bike . A child ( i.e. , target child ) household eligibility range serve analysis ( choose randomization procedure ) . Post hoc examination use Tukey follow-up procedure utilized necessary . Our secondary objective ( parent ; parent/child ; gender ; season ; fitness variable , etc . ) , also analyze use variant design addition factor . Cluster analysis/Hierarchical Linear Modelling use parent/child collinearity . Our pilot study ( r = .21 ) prior research suggest limited collinearity appropriate explore finding approach give naturally cluster environment ( i.e. , family home ) . Prediction use model ( TPB , SDT ) question mediation achieve via multiple regression analysis follow standard procedure type test . The qualitative analysis incorporate follow process : 1 ) Invite participant review transcript interview , summarize perception data , accuracy , check trustworthiness data ; 2 ) Conduct thematic analysis use reciprocal cod approach researcher engage open dialogue theme data interpretation . In , transcript first review independently , dialogue composite theme related critical issue develop ; 3 ) Manage data use NVivo software program . NVivo enable theory building , test elaboration . With NVivo , 'free node ' create cod process , capture participant ' perspective investigator ' critical issue .</detailed_description>
