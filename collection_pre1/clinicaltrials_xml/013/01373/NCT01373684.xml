	<brief_title>PEG-interferon Alfa-2a add-on Study HBeAg Negative Chronic Hepatitis B Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) one serious health problem affect 350 million people worldwide , account one million death every year . Hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) -negative chronic hepatitis B represent late phase course infection , recognize worldwide increase prevalence . Therapeutic intervention often indicate HBeAg-negative patient spontaneous remission rarely occur patient usually advance liver disease comparison HBeAg-positive patient . With introduction nucleos ( ) ide analogue ( NA ) , important progress make regard antiviral therapy CHB , management HBeAg-negative type remain difficult . NA target reverse transcriptase hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) potent inhibitor viral replication . Initiation treatment HBeAg-negative CHB usually result rapid decline serum HBV DNA level , often accompany normalization serum aminotransferase . However , response treatment may durable large proportion patient discontinuation therapy , indicate necessity long-term , maybe indefinite , treatment . Although NA well-tolerated first year treatment , little known long-term safety resistance . In contrast , antiviral potency peginterferon ( PEG-IFN ) inferior nucleoside analogue , response PEG-IFN probably durable majority patient due immunomodulatory effect . Sustained off-treatment response achieve 25 % patient treat PEG-IFN 1 year . Natural killer ( NK ) cell innate immune cell represent first line defense viral infection play also important role control adaptive response . The numerous mechanism evolve virus inhibit NK cell activity , already demonstrate HIV HCV , may direct innate immune response , may represent strategy prevent effective induction adaptive immune response . Defective T cell activity observe viral infection may therefore represent bystander effect viral NK cell inhibition . Recent finding group demonstrate NK cell derive peripheral blood chronic HBV patient display impaired capacity produce IFNgamma , important cytokine skew virus-specific Th-1 response , compare healthy control . Since HBV show able directly interfere immune cell well IFNalpha-induced intracellular signalling , viral load reduction may improve function immune cell , may also facilitate response PEG-IFNalpha therapy subsequently induction effective HBV-specific immune response . Treatment nucleoside analogue subsequent viral decline already show restore helper T-cell ( TH-cell ) cytotoxic T-cell ( CTL ) responsiveness chronic HBV infect patient . Add-on treatment PEG-IFN expect stimulate adaptive immune reactivity may therefore result high rate response . Previous study investigate effect lower viral load NA therapy HBeAg-positive CHB prior initiation PEG-IFN show promising response rate treatment . A study Sarin et al . show significantly high rate sustain HBeAg loss patient receive 4 week lamivudine PEG-IFN therapy ( n=36 ) compare receive placebo 4 week ( n=27 ) ( 36 % vs. 15 % , p=0.05 ) . This treatment strategy however yet apply HBeAg-negative patient . Current guideline recommend continuation NA therapy HBeAg-negative CHB hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) clear serum . However , HBsAg loss rarely occur NA therapy HBeAg-negative patient . In contrast , PEG-IFN therapy associate increase rate HBsAg loss every year discontinuation therapy . In study Chan et al . HBsAg remain stable HBeAg-positive patient tend reduce slowly HBeAg-negative patient . They conclude reduction HBsAg &gt; 1 log IU/mL could reflect improve immune control . It previously show study group 14 % HBeAg-negative CHB patient HBsAg concentration decline &gt; 1 log 24 week therapy PEG-IFN . Moucari et al . find HBsAg decline &gt; 1 log 25 % patient week 24 , mean decrease 0.8 , 1.5 , 2.1 log IU/mL week 12 , 24 , 48 , respectively . Another study show 22 % patient HBsAg concentration decline &gt; 1 log 48 week treatment , significantly associate HBsAg clearance three year treatment PEG-IFN . However , recent study also show HBsAg level decrease prolong NA therapy HBeAg-negative CHB . Addition PEG-IFN NA therapy HBeAg-negative patient may therefore necessary induce decline HBsAg level , first step towards subsequent HBsAg loss .</detailed_description>
