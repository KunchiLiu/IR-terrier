	<brief_summary>Infection remain one difficult-to-treat complication total hip arthroplasty . The gold standard treatment two-stage removal prosthesis later replacement permanent implants.The first stage consist removal infect arthroplasty component surround devitalized tissue , copious pulse irrigation , placement temporary antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer . This spacer typically leave place six week , time patient receive intravenous antibiotic . After surgeon feel infection eradicate , second debridement require , second operative procedure perform . While use antibiotic spacer well accept , whether spacer immobilize hip ( so-called `` static '' spacer ) allow range motion ( so-called `` articulate '' spacer ) controversial . Proponents static spacers argue immobilization periarticular soft tissue aid clearance infection spacers simpler fashion intraoperatively . Proponents articulate spacers argue improve hip function , prevent damage musculature surround hip , allow easy reimplantation , improve hip function , prevent dislocation follow hip reimplantation . While good result describe method , comparative trial conflict whether spacer design alters hip function , operative time , dislocation rate . Equipoise exist within literature , randomize clinical trial conduct evaluate issue . The purpose study compare articulate static antibiotic-impregnated spacers treatment chronic periprosthetic infection complicate total hip arthroplasty prospective , randomized clinical trial . The goal trial determine effect spacer design upon eradication infection , hip function , ease reimplantation , dislocation rate . The investigator hypothesize articulate spacers provide short operative time replantation improve hip function hip dislocation rate follow hip reimplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Antibiotic Spacer Design Treat Infection After Hip Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After diagnosis infection inform consent , patient take operate room . After anesthetization , patient randomize either articulate spacer static spacer . Randomization perform prepared opaque envelope administer nonparticipant study . After complete debridement devitalize tissue , explantation infect component associate cement , either articulate static spacer place . All spacers form use 3.0 g Vancomycin 1.0 g Tobramycin 40 g packet cement . Articulating spacers form antibiotic-impregnated cement use Stage One system ( Biomet , Warsaw , IN ) size fit endosteal acetabular bone defect . Static spacers hand-made rod antibiotic-impregnated cement cement bead sufficient quantity fill acetabulum . Post-operatively , patient make touch-down weight bearing protect walker crutch . At time reimplantation , joint aspirate multiple culture obtain along intraoperative histopathological analysis evaluate persistent infection . Data collect preoperatively include age , gender , laterality , etiology hip degeneration , comorbidities , Harris Hip score , infect organism Paprosky femoral acetabular bone loss classification . The Harris Hip score use extensively study revision hip arthroplasty find reliable valid determine preoperatively follow-up visit . Data collect time implant removal reimplantation include operative time , blood loss , surgical approach , need extend trochanteric osteotomy . Radiographs perform immediately follow prior reimplantation review determine spacer utilize cause bone loss ; bone loss cut bony surface confirm intraoperatively . At follow-up visit radiographic appearance , Harris Hip Score , dislocation event , recurrence infection , need revision reoperation kind hip determine . All portion study part conventional care except randomization collection Harris Hip Score . Which type spacer use currently depend upon judgment attend surgeon use routinely . The primary outcome variable Harris Hip Score . A power analysis conduct assistance Dr. Mario Moric Rush . Using standard deviation Harris Hip Scores Hsieh colleague ( 2004 ) Fehring colleague ( 1999 ) , large previous study report data , Dr. Moric estimate 56 patient , 28 patient per group , would need detect clinically relevant difference ten point . To account attrition , target total sample size 80 patient .</detailed_description>
