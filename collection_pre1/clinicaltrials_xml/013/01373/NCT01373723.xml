	<detailed_description>Background A high percentage cervical cancer case undergone cytological test within 10 year prior diagnosis . Different population intervention could improve coverage public system , although cost also increase . The aim study compare effectiveness cost three type population intervention increase number female participant screen programme cancer cervix carry Primary Care four basic health care area . Methods A cost-effectiveness analysis perform perspective public health system include woman 30 70 year age ( n=20,994 ) incorrect screen criterion four basic health care area Valles Occidental , Barcelona , Spain . The patient randomly distribute control group three Intervention Groups ( IG1 : invitation letter participate screening ; IG2 : invitation letter informative leaflet ; IG3 : invitation letter , informative leaflet phone call reminder ) follow three year . Clinical effectiveness measure number Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) , epithelial lesion cancer cervix case detect . The number death avoid secondary measure effectiveness . The temporal horizon analysis life expectancy female population study . Costs effectiveness discount 3 % . In addition , univariate multivariate sensitivity analysis carry . Expected result IG3 expect cost-effective intervention IG1 IG2 , great detection HPV infection , epithelial lesion cancer strategy , albeit great cost . METHODS An economic evaluation three populational screen strategy cervical cancer perform . Particularly , cost-effectiveness analysis conduct . These intervention compare current opportunistic screening strategy use data multicentre randomise trial ( CRICERVA ) . The analysis conduct National Health Care System perspective . Design : Pragmatic , blind , multicentre , randomise , control clinical trial four branch , three year follow-up . The randomisation unit Basic Health Care Area ( BHCA ) . Setting : Primary Health Care Services ( PCS ) Cerdanyola-Ripollet , province Barcelona , comprise 4 municipality 5 BHCA . The population cover Primary Care Service ( PCS ) 120,293 inhabitant 14 year . As four study group 5 BHCAs , 4 BHCAs homogeneous socioeconomic criterion consider . Population : 20,994 woman 30 70 year age incorrect screen criterion ( data obtain Data Base Primary Health Care Services ) ascribe BHCA include study . Incorrect screen define [ 9 ] : 1.- No cytology last 3 year woman 30 40 year , 2.- No cytology previous 5 year woman 40 65 year , 3.- No previous cytology history female older 65 year woman last cytology age 60 . The exclusion criterion : ( ) hysterectomised woman , current history pre-malignant lesion [ Atypical Glandular Cells Undetermined Significance ( AGUS ) , Atypical Squamous Cells Undetermined Significance ( ASCUS ) , Low-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions ( LSIL ) , High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions ( HSIL ) ] , carcinoma situ cervical-uterine cancer , Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) positive cause immunosuppression ( since woman follow specific protocol ) ; ( b ) reside outside study set 6 month ; ( c ) ascribe study BHCA physician assign UBA another zone different one consider study . Sample size : The sample size calculate base detection difference effectiveness compare Non Intervention Group ( NIG ) . It calculate multiply size simple randomise design design effect factor inflation . For simple randomised design , accept alpha risk 0.05 beta risk 0.20 bilateral contrast , 59 subject require first group 59 second group detect difference great equal 28.4 % screening coverage 41.6 % Non Intervention Group ( NIG ) . The lose follow rate estimate 20 % . The calculation sample perform Granmo 5.2 computer programme Windows . According review literature [ 23-25 ] , consider intraclass correlation coefficient 0.05 mean number 3,500 woman 30 70 year age incorrect screen BHCA , design effect 176 thus , 20,768 woman incorrect screening require . ETHICAL ASPECTS The investigator commit respect prevailing norm Good Clinical Practice well requisites Declaration Helsinki clauses general particular ethical condition relate right privacy , anonymity confidentiality . Neither first name surname type data indicate identification woman register . Therefore , identification make numeric code . Since type study develop usual clinical setting , authorisation support must already grant representative authority collective involve thus , individualise informed consent necessary . Nonetheless , research team decide woman attend consultation cytology sign consent form . The protocol evaluate Clinical Investigation Ethics Committee IDIAP Jordi Gol . LIMITATIONS Randomisation group avoid potential introduction selection bias may produce among intervention perform site . Since characteristic study allow application double-blind masking technique , mask response evaluation use ensure measurement interpretation dependent variable carry way group . The possible loss information , may produce woman screen outside public health care contact research team , minimise phone call reminder . This make woman attend appointment . The language difficulty woman country solve cultural mediator site . Within set study , administrative personnel update postal address user attend BHCA since 2007 , therefore postal registry quite precise , thereby reduce potential loss letter .
