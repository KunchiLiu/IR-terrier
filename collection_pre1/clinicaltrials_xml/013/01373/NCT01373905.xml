	<brief_title>Stepwise Positive End Expiratory Pressure Elevation For Lung Recruitment Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , protective lung strategy positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) therapy start early possible avoid lung damage high pressure , volume fraction inspire oxygen ( FiO2 ) . Recruitment strategy aim re-expanding collapse lung tissue maintain adequate level PEEP prevent subsequent de-recruitment . The objective study compare safety efficacy two lung recruitment maneuver ( RM ) : stepwise PEEP elevation determination alveolar collapse pressure versus sustain lung inflation ARDS patient</detailed_description>
