	<brief_title>Sublingual Immunotherapy Peanut Allergy Induction Tolerance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allergy peanut tree nut affect approximately 1.4 % population . Allergic reaction peanut severe life threaten account vast majority fatality due food-induced anaphylaxis . At present , viable treatment option patient peanut allergy . The current standard care strict dietary elimination emergency preparedness anaphylaxis kit event accidental reaction . Our group others show oral immunotherapy provide protection anaphylaxis variety food protein . In addition , ongoing research demonstrate sublingual immunotherapy peanut provide safe , alternative mode immunotherapy reduce allergic reaction rate ( desensitization ) oral food challenge ( OFC ) peanut . The goal study desensitize peanut allergic child use peanut sublingual immunotherapy determine nonreactive state immune system persist treatment discontinue ( tolerance ) . Children age 1-11 year enrol follow entry double blind , placebo control food challenge ( DBPCFC ) . After least 48 month peanut SLIT study drug , subject undergo second DBPCFC 5000 mg peanut protein assess desensitization . - Subjects desensitize able consume MCRT without symptom , define 300 mg peanut protein . Subjects consume less 300 mg peanut protein without symptom stop peanut SLIT conclude study . These subject undergo additional study procedure include remain protocol DBPCFCs recommend resume strict peanut avoidance diet . - Subjects able consume 300 mg peanut protein randomize interval 1 17 week peanut include peanut SLIT study drug discontinue . This period avoidance follow third DBPCFC 5000 mg peanut protein evaluate loss desensitization effect . After final DBPCFC , study complete subject . At primary investigator clinical discretion , recommend transition daily peanut food equivalent maintain desensitized effect . Outcome variables interest include response double blind , placebo control food challenge , skin prick testing , peanut specific serum immunoglobin E ( IgE ) , immunoglobin G ( IgG ) , immunoglobin G4 ( IgG4 ) salivary immunoglobin A ( IgA ) , T B cell response , basophil hyporesponsiveness , quality life , adverse event .</detailed_description>
