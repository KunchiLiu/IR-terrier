	<brief_summary>Infection remain difficult-to-treat complication total knee arthroplasty . The gold standard treatment two-stage removal prosthesis later replacement permanent implant . The first stage consist removal infect arthroplasty component surround devitalized tissue , copious pulse irrigation , placement temporary antibiotic-impregnated cement spacer . This spacer typically leave place six week , time patient receive intravenous antibiotic . After surgeon feel infection eradicate , patient require repeat debridement , second operative procedure perform . While use antibiotic-loaded spacer well accept , whether spacer immobilize knee ( so-called `` static '' spacer ) allow range motion ( so-called `` articulate '' spacer ) controversial . Proponents articulate spacers argue prevent scarring musculature surround knee result easy reimplantation , improve long-term knee function , improve range motion . Proponents static spacers argue immobilization periarticular soft tissue aid clearance infection simpler fashion intraoperatively . While good result describe method , comparative trial conflict whether spacer design alters knee function , operative time , range motion . Equipoise exist within literature , randomize clinical trial conduct evaluate issue . The purpose study compare articulate static antibiotic-impregnated spacers treatment chronic periprosthetic infection complicate total knee arthroplasty prospective , randomized clinical trial . The goal trial determine effect spacer design upon eradication infection , knee function , ease reimplantation , range motion . The investigator hypothesize articulate spacers provide short operative time reimplantation , improve knee function range motion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After diagnosis infection inform consent , patient take operate room . After anesthetization , patient randomize either articulate spacer static spacer . Randomization perform prepared opaque envelope administer nonparticipant study . After complete debridement devitalize tissue , explantation infect component associate cement , either articulate static spacer place . All spacers form 3 g Vancomycin 1 g Tobramycin 40 g packet cement . Articulating spacers form antibiotic impregnated cement use Stage One system ( Biomet , Warsaw , IN ) . Static spacers hand-made fit femoral tibial expose metaphyses solid block associate antibiotic cement coat tibial femoral intramedullary rod , knee motion minimize . Post-operatively , patient make touch-down weight bearing protect walker crutch . If static spacer place , patient immobilize use knee immobilizer . If articulate spacer utilized , range motion allow limit stability determine operating room protect hinged knee brace . At time reoperation , joint aspirate multiple culture obtain along intraoperative histopathological analysis evaluate persistent infection . Data collect preoperatively include age , gender , laterality , etiology knee degeneration , comorbidities , Knee Society score , infect organism . The Knee Society score use extensively study revision knee arthroplasty find reliable valid determine pre-operatively follow-up visit . Data collect time implant removal reimplantation include operative time , blood loss , need extensile exposure . Radiographs perform immediately follow prior reimplantation review determine spacer utilize cause bone loss ; bone loss cut bony surface confirm intraoperatively . At follow-up visit radiographic appearance , Knee Society Score , knee range motion , recurrence infection , need revision reoperation kind knee determine . All portion study part conventional care except randomization either static articulating spacer . Which type spacer use currently depend upon judgment attend surgeon use routinely . The primary outcome variable range motion . A power analysis conduct assistance Dr. Mario Moric Rush use range motion primary outcome variable , standard deviation cull two large series date -Van Thiel colleague ( 2010 ) Fehring colleague ( 2000 ) . For 80 % chance detecting predetermine clinically significant difference 10 degree , 53 patient per group , 106 patient total , need . To account attrition , target sample size 140 patient .</detailed_description>
