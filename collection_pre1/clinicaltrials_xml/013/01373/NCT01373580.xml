	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Evaluate Corneal Inlay Improvement Near Vision Presbyopic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The loss near vision ability perform task require near vision part normal age process . This natural transformation eye occur result loss accommodation crystalline lens , condition know presbyopia . Presbyopia , characterize progressive , age-related loss accommodation ( i.e. , lens ability focus clearly wide range distance ) , prevalent visual deficiency , affect 100 % population course normal life span . Loss accommodation begin early life , emmetropic eye , generally culminate complete loss functional near vision . ReVision Optics develop Raindrop corneal inlay correction near vision . The Raindrop 2mm corneal inlay , small pinhead , thinner human hair 1/500th droplet water . The inlay refractive index human cornea . The inlay place non-dominant eye , center pupil corneal flap ( LASIK ) make . The Raindrop expect provide presbyopic subject improvement near intermediate vision .</detailed_description>
