	<brief_title>Oral Lenalidomide Intravesical BCG Therapy Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators plan screen approximately 100 people bladder cancer 18 year age old throughout United States study . This multi-center study combine two marketed drug , one use previously people transitional cell cancer . Lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) drug alters immune system may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may reduce prevent growth cancer cell . Lenalidomide approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment specific type myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) combination dexamethasone patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) receive least 1 prior therapy . MDS MM cancer blood . Lenalidomide currently test variety cancer condition . It approve FDA use people bladder cancer , case consider experimental . The drug use study Bacille Calmette-Guerrin ( BCG ) . BCG approve FDA use people bladder cancer .</detailed_description>
