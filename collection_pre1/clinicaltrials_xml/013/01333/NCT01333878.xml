	<brief_title>Impact Subcutaneous Abatacept Rheumatoid Arthritis Assessing Inhibition Structural Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label study efficacy subcutaneous ( SC ) Abatacept inhibit progression structural joint damage patient active rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) receive MTX inadequate disease control ( define ESR base DAS28 ≥ 3.2 AND ≥ 6 swollen ≥ 6 tender joint ) . The study consist screen period ( Days -21 -7 ) , baseline visit ( Days -20 -1 ) , treatment Period ( open label Abatacept 125 mg SC 24 week ) . All visit may occur indicated week +/- 2 day . The last efficacy assessment conduct Week 24 subject contact telephone safety follow-up 2 month final study agent administer . The maximum length study 35 week , include 2-week screening period , 1-week baseline period , 24-week open label treatment , 8-week follow-up period . Eligible subject continue current MTX treatment regimen , stable dose least 15mg/week , entire length study ( 24 week ) . At Day 0 , patient meet inclusion criterion , dose Day 0 Week 24 Abatacept 125 mg SC injection . Subjects self-administer SC study agent Weeks 5 , 6 , 7 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 14 , 15 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 21 , 22 , 23 require return study site week .
