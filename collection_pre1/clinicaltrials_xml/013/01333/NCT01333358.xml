	<brief_summary>The main purpose research study investigate well medicine ( alemtuzumab ) work treat MS-related cognitive problem ( e.g. , attention , memory , speed thinking ) . This study include 30 subject six research site . Alemtuzumab approve sell brand name Campath MabCampath treat type leukemia . As leukemia treatment , give often much high dos study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Alemtuzumab Treatment Stabilizing Neurocognitive Function In Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current proposal conduct study use battery neuropsychological test capable detect broad range cognitive difficulty associate relapse remit multiple sclerosis . This study compare cognitive functioning time patient receive alemtuzumab . The study also compare change cognitive functioning time relapse remit multiple sclerosis patient receive interferon beta-1a normal control enrol parallel study conduct Wilken et al.To evaluate cognitive effect alemtuzumab , investigator perform neurological exam brain scan administer questionnaire measure severity multiple sclerosis , well subject functioning , feeling , find medical visit subject may study . Neurological test study require subject perform relatively simple task evaluate multiple sclerosis . These task include five hundred meter walk , time twenty five foot walk , nine hole peg test , eye exam , test require add small number head quickly . The brain scan involve Magnetic Resonance Imaging painless , except injection contrast agent call gadolinium , necessary detect area brain MS may currently active . Magnetic Resonance Imaging widely use diagnose assess patient multiple sclerosis . All patient require return study site every 3 month assessment test . In addition , safety-related blood test perform least monthly . If blood test result become abnormal , may blood test take frequently , case weekly , test result improve . Monthly blood test perform study site , subject unable return study site blood testing , may able use local laboratory . Participation study last least 4 year possibly longer . Subjects receive alemtuzumab , need blood test every month least 3 year last dose alemtuzumab . Therefore , need undergo monthly blood test total 4 year . If test result become abnormal , may blood test frequently , case weekly , test result improve .</detailed_description>
