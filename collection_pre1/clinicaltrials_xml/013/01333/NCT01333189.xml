	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine rehabilitation use weight-bearing biofeedback training follow total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) effective standard rehabilitation method promote weight-bearing symmetry lower limbs functional activity sit-to-stand transfer walk . Secondary outcomes interest include functional measure internal moment hip , knee , ankle joint sit-to-stand walking .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Function After Knee Arthroplasty With Weight-Bearing Biofeedback</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People knee replacement surgery typically bad physical function compare healthy people similar age . This problem occur despite completion standard rehabilitation program . One reason less-than-optimal restoration physical function standard rehabilitation effectively address habitual movement pattern persist surgery . These movement pattern characterize patient place less weight surgical leg compare non-surgical leg surgery . This asymmetrical movement pattern identify researcher show completely resolve knee replacement surgery , even though surgery reliably reduce knee pain . The persistence asymmetrical weight-bearing every day activity may limit stimulus need full recovery muscle joint surgical leg . By promote increase load surgical leg , great stimulus provide promote well functional recovery , compare standard rehabilitation . As result , people may subsequently move symmetrically improved recovery physical function . Improved function would turn promote person 's ability participate life event , limit disability . Considering 500,000 knee replacement surgery occur United States year , maximize functional recovery limit disability follow surgery important goal . The investigator propose new method exercise follow knee replacement surgery . This method involve use commercially available game system promote `` re-loading '' surgical limb . The game system game design allow person play move object character screen shift his/her weight one leg another standing instrument `` balance board '' . The investigator develop exercise program promote shift weight surgical limb , choose appropriate game manipulate goal game . It investigators ' hypothesis early application surgical leg `` re-loading '' intervention knee replacement result meaningful improvement physical function improve movement symmetry .</detailed_description>
