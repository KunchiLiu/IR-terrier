	<brief_title>Assessing Volar Locking Plates Patients Under 65 With Distal Radius Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design prospective randomize control trial examine cost effectiveness treat distal radius fracture open reduction internal fixation volar lock plate ( VLP ) close reduction k-wire fixation ( K-Wires ) . All patient age &lt; 65 year isolated distal radius fracture ( extra-articular simple intra-articular , AO type A C1 ) require operative fixation include study . Patients underlie osteoporosis , injury complex intra-articular fracture exclude study . Once eligibility determine , patient randomize one two treatment arm . They treat either closed reduction percutaneous k-wire fixation 6 week cast immobilization ( K-wire ) open reduction internal fixation volar lock plate early range motion ( begin 10-14 day ) ( VLP ) . All patient undergo standardized pre-operative evaluation . This include classification fracture ( base AO classification ) , baseline PRWE DASH score , measure general health ( SF-12 ) general health utility questionnaire ( EQ-5d ) . Patients required report detail occupational physical demand number work day miss due injury . Patient test incorporate schedule clinic visit . Data collect initial assessment , 2 week post-operatively , 6 week , 12 week , 6 month 12 month fracture . At visit , AP lateral wrist radiograph also obtain . The investigator examine outcome group base range motion , grip strength , standardized patient rat pain disability score ( PRWE DASH ) . In order capture differences 2 group early phase recovery - investigator administer 2 additional assessment 4 9 week either phone email . These telephone assessment include assessment patient rat pain disability ( DASH , PRWE ) patient ask provide detail whether return work usual activity . The primary outcome , patient rat pain disability , quantify Patient Rated Wrist Evaluation ( PRWE ) tool show valid , reliable highly responsive distal radius fracture population . Secondary outcome include range motion , strength , Disabilities Arm Shoulder Hand Score ( DASH ) time return work . The cost analysis include direct indirect cost , include : OR time , anesthesia time , surgeon fee , cost outpatient visit , equipment cost ( volar lock plate k-wires ) , x-rays , casting , splint , number work day miss work disability cost . The investigator also use health utility score ( EQ-5d ) determine cost per quality adjust life year ( QALY ) associate intervention . Based sample size calculation , investigator need 28 patient treatment arm ( power 80 % , p = 0.05 ) . Allowing 10-15 % drop-out rate , 64 patient require enrollment . The secondary outcome include ROM , grip strength , union rate , mean time union ( week ) DASH score .</detailed_description>
