	<brief_summary>Patients type lymph gland disease call Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma come back , may come back , go away treatment , include standard treatment know disease . This research study use special immune system cell call tumor associate antigen ( TAA ) -specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte , new experimental therapy . This sort therapy use previously treat Hodgkin non-Hodgkin lymphoma show proof infection Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) , virus cause infectious mononucleosis ( `` mono '' `` kiss disease '' ) . EBV find cancer cell half patient Hodgkin 's non-Hodgkin lymphoma . This suggest may play role cause lymphoma . The cancer cell infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape kill . Investigators test whether special white blood cell , call T cell , train kill EBV-infected cell could affect tumor , many patient find give trained T cell cause complete partial response . However , many patient EBV lymphoma cell ; therefore investigator want test whether possible direct special T cell type protein tumor cell surface similar promising result . The protein target study call tumor associate antigen ( TAAs ) - cell proteins specific cancer cell , either show show low quantity normal human cell . In study , target five TAAs commonly show lymphoma , call : NY-ESO-1 , MAGEA4 , PRAME , Survivin SSX . This do use special type T cell call cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( CTLs ) generate lab . In addition , adult patient receive drug call 5-azacytidine give T cell . We hope combination help T cell work well .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The patient give blood make TAA-specific cytotoxic T cell lab . These cell grow frozen . If TAA-specific cytotoxic T cell make , time collection blood manufacture T cell administration patient 1 2 month . The cell inject IV patient 10 minute . Initially , two dos T cell give two week apart . The patient may eligible receive six additional dos T cell monthly interval . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Houston Methodist Hospital Texas Children 's Hospital . There 4 stage study : antigen-escalation phase , dose-escalation stage , 5-aza stage pediatric patient stage . The antigen-escalation phase first . Patients receive TAA-specific T cell target first 1 2 TAAs . Once schedule prof safe , next group patient receive TAA-specific T cell target first 2 3 TAAs . This process continue 4 level study . This mean final cohort patient receive TAA-specific T cell target first 4 5 TAAs . If side-effects severe , number TAAs target lower T cell injection stop . After antigen-escalation phase , dose-escalation phase begin . Patients start low dose ( 1 3 different level ) T cell . Once dose schedule prove safe , next group patient start high dose . This process continue 3 dose level study . If side-effects severe , dose lower T cell injection stop . After dose escalation stage , adult patient enrol 5-aza stage receive drug 5-aza follow two infusion T cell dose level 2 . Patients give 3 cycle 5-aza ( administered daily vein 5 day , every 28 day ) follow 2 dos multiTAA-specific T cell administer 14 day apart . Before patient give 5-aza give drug help prevent nausea vomit . On pediatric stage , pediatric patient receive 2 infusion T cell dose level 2 . The T cell give 14 day apart . The cell inject IV 10 minute . The patient may pre-treated acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) . Acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) give prevent possible allergic reaction T cell administration . Initially , two dos T cell give two week apart . If second infusion reduction size patient 's lymphoma CT MRI scan assess radiologist , patient receive six ( 6 ) additional dos T cell monthly interval wish . All treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Houston Methodist Hospital Texas Children 's Hospital . In first second T cell infusion 6 week last infusion , patient receive anti-cancer treatment radiation therapy chemotherapy . If patient receive therapy in-between first second infusion T cell , take treatment able receive second infusion T cell . MEDICAL TESTS BEFORE TREATMENT - Physical exam . - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function . - Measurements tumor routine imaging study . We use image study use follow tumor : CT , MRI , PET . - Pregnancy test female child . MEDICAL TESTS DURING AND AFTER TREATMENT - Blood test measure blood cell , kidney liver function . - Imaging study 6 week 2nd TAA-CTL infusion . To learn way T cell work patient 's body , extra 20-40 mL ( 4-8 teaspoon ) blood take cycle 5-aza ( applicable ) , 2 week cycle 5-aza ( applicable ) , T-cell infusion , Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 6 . One additional blood sample might draw 3 4 day post T-cell infusion ; optional . Afterwards , blood collect 3 , 6 , 9 12 month last infusion . The blood may draw central line time patient 's regular blood test . Investigators use blood see long T cell last , look immune response patient 's cancer . Study Duration : Patients active study participation approximately one year . Patients receive additional dos T cell describe actively follow 1 year last dose T cell . Investigators remain contact patient year 4 additional year ( total 5 year follow-up ) order evaluate disease response long-term .</detailed_description>
