	<brief_summary>Child undernutrition remain highly prevalent condition low middle income country major portion global burden childhood malnutrition find South Asia estimate 74 million child live chronic malnutrition ( stunted growth ) region . This burden malnutrition account approximately 50 % five child death develop country . The risk child death also relate severity malnutrition progressively increase child 's growth deviate WHO Growth Standard , e.g . child height-for-age &lt; -3 Z score standard four fold increase mortality risk compare child within one Z score growth standard mean . Underweight child 18.7 % global disability-adjusted life year child less five year age . Childhood malnutrition pervasive problem Bangladesh 43 % child less five year stunt 2004 38 % urban child population . An establish approach promote appropriate breastfeeding practice use local peer counsellor provide information support mother . A recent study conduct pioneer research approach Bangladesh.. The main aim study use Cluster Randomized Control Trial ( CRCT ) collect high-level evidence whether peer counsel woman promote appropriate breastfeeding complementary feeding improve feeding practice , child growth reduce prevalence malnutrition child . The investigator use community-based Cluster Randomized Control Trial ( CRCT ) examine impact peer counsel infant feeding education program start third trim pregnancy one year delivery , improve child feeding practice , child growth reduce prevalence malnutrition child . This result two study group . The outcome assessment make cohort infant-mother dyad measure baseline follow visit investigator expect likely high correlation baseline follow outcome measure , thus make approach efficient study design . Outcome assessment conduct mother-infant pair recruit community cluster study , expect total 1950 mother-infant day ( 975 treatment group ) . The peer counsel education offer eligible pregnant woman identify household survey 3 month community cluster intervention group . Using similar approach recruitment , cohort mother-infant dyad , receive standard maternal child health care program , identify control cluster . Data collect anthropometry , feed practice hygiene care practice etc . The investigator report result 2-sided 5 % test primary trial outcome . Secondary analysis examine outcome variable ( stunt , height-for-age , feed pattern , mean nutrient intake ) take account repeat measurement within child use separate mixed model . The investigator use linear mixed model continuous outcome ( e.g . height-for-age Z ) generalize linear mixed model non-continuous outcome ( e.g . logistic mixed model binary outcome e.g . percentage exclusively breastfeed ) . It expect publication research substantial impact child health help development public health nutrition policy child South Asia widely cite .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Experimental design . Study design We use community-based Cluster Randomized Control Trial ( CRCT ) examine impact peer counsel infant feeding education program start third trim pregnancy one year delivery , improve child feeding practice , child growth reduce prevalence malnutrition child . This result two study group ( see diagram ) . The outcome assessment make cohort infant-mother dyad measure baseline follow visit expect likely high correlation baseline follow outcome measure , thus make approach efficient study design . The trial conduct total 50 community cluster ( Mahallas - small geographic unit Dhaka -see detail Sampling Scheme ) , 25 cluster study group . The peer counsel education intervention deliver mother , locally recruit trained peer counsellor , start third trim pregnancy child one year age . The peer counsel education offer eligible pregnant woman identify household survey 3 month community cluster intervention group . Using similar approach recruitment , cohort mother-infant dyad , receive standard maternal child health care program , identify control cluster . Outcome assessment conduct mother-infant pair recruit community cluster study , expect total 1950 mother-infant dyad ( 975 treatment group ) . There baseline assessment assessment every 3 month birth child 18 month age . Two assessment ( infant 15 18 month age ) make education intervention cease assess sustain impact prevalence child stunt infant feeding practice ( see evaluation plan detail ) . In CRCT intervention allocate community level , outcome assessment individual level . This best comparative design propose intervention , deliver individual mother densely populated urban slum community avoid contamination intervention . A four year study require ensure adequate `` dose intervention '' deliver mother intervention group , give time evaluate longer-term impact intervention . RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURE : b . Sampling scheme The propose field area study Mirpur , `` auxiliary Thana '' Dhaka Metropolitan City Corporation total population 5,580,000 ( accord Census 2001 , although may increase 20 % 30 % since ) . Mirpur 16 `` Wards '' small urban administrative unit local government authority call `` Ward Council '' . The average population `` Ward '' 350,000 people . Below `` Wards '' `` Mahallas '' low urban geographic unit identifiable boundary . On average five `` Mahallas '' per `` Ward '' average population 70,000 people . The unit randomization trial Mahallas . In Mirpur total 80 Mahallas , form sampling frame select cluster trial . The list Mahallas available Dhaka Metropolitan City Corporation . The definition `` crude birth rate ( CBR ) number birth per 1,000 population specify time period '' . [ 6 ] The 2004 Bangladesh DHS report current CBR urban Bangladesh 25.8 per 1000 population 3 year prior survey . Thus average expected number birth Mahallas 3 month period would 150 , would require recruitment number trial ensure feasibility sample scheme trial . c. Recruitment inclusion/exclusion criterion cluster `` Mallahas '' sample frame eligible study infant feed intervention currently implement either government non-government sector . Any program identify contact local official Ward Councils Mirpur . At present infant feed promotion program run government health service area . The Dhaka Metropolitan City Corporation contact person obtain write approval study `` Mahallas '' allocate treatment group trial recruitment subject begin . d. Assignment treatments The intervention assign eligible `` Mahallas '' use fix randomisation scheme uniform allocation ratio treatment , block 5 10 ensure geographic balance across Mirpur area . The random allocation sequence generate use SAS software . e. Recruitment , inclusion/exclusion criterion consent mother family A previously successful approach recruitment use trained field assistant identify woman third trim pregnancy systematic door-to-door survey across `` Mahallas '' 3 month period . Pregnant woman include 16 35 year three live child . Women plan migrate Mirpur area delivery exclude . Also woman document medical record heart disease , tuberculosis , gestational diabetes eclampsia previous pregnancy exclude . Mother-infants pair also exclude multiple birth , congenital abnormality , low birthweight 1.5 kg infant admit neonatal intensive care unit . Based experience similar project Bangladesh [ 3,8 ] expect least 95 % mother consent participate . It also likely 30 % exclude mainly related desire migrate back home village delivery . Sample Size Calculation Outcome ( Primary Secondary ) Variable ( ) The sample size trial estimate follow assumption : Sample size calculation increase rate exclusive breastfeed intervention group â€¢ Considering rate Exclusive Breast Feeding ( EBF ) 43 % control cluster , Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey ( BDHS ) 2007 expect rate EBF 63 % i.e . increase 20 % intervention group require sample size 92.4 group use formula ; n= P1 ( 100-p1 ) + P2 ( 100-p2 ) / ( P2-P1 ) 2 x 7.9 Taking 95 ( round figure ) multiply 4 reduce cluster effect sample size become 380 . Calculating 20 % drop , migration require sample size come 456 group 0.05 significance power 0.80 . - Each community-cluster ( Mahalla ) average population 70,000 expect crude birth rate 4.3 per 1000 total population 6 month [ base CBR urban Bangladesh 25.8/1000 population 36 month 2004 BDHS thus give average expect number birth 150 3 month period per Mahalla cluster . - Previous research indicate appropriately 33 % pregnant woman return home village follow delivery , thus leave expect number eligible birth 200 6 month period per Mahalla cluster . - 39 mother-infant dyad per Mahalla cluster assume 95 % participation 22 % loss follow-up base earlier research , approximately 200 mother-infant dyad available cluster 6 month period . - 90 % power 5 % two-sided alpha - Intra-cluster correlation coefficient ( ICC ) 0.015 [ base analysis child anthropometric measurement 2004 Bangladesh DHS survey data urban child population . - Expected difference prevalence stunt treatment group 10 % ( 35 % control 25 % intervention group ) , similar change report early education intervention young child feed Peru . The sample size require would 1950 mother-infant pair ( 975 treatment group ) 50 Mallahas cluster 39 mother-infant dyad per community cluster recruit 3 month . Facilities Available Describe availability physical facility site conduction study . For clinical laboratory-based study , indicate provision hospital type adequate patient care laboratory support service . Identify laboratory facility major equipment require study . For field study , describe field area include size , population , mean communication . ( ) . Manpower ( b ) . Administrative infra-structure ( c ) . Expertise ( ) . Anthropometric equipment 's Intervention plan The trial intervention select feasibility test urban population Dhaka , likely sustainable future . The propose individual peer counsel education sufficient intensity alter infant young child feeding practice improve growth young child prevent malnutrition . After one year preparation trial , intervention deliver woman start pregnancy child one year age second third year study . . Description intervention The approach promote appropriate infant young child feed program home-based peer counselling train , local woman mother ' community . This approach reach mother deliver home also allow message reach key family member may play role support breastfeed influence food choice infant . The main message direct encouraging early initiation breastfeeding , promote exclusive breastfeeding first 6 month life , promote appropriate timing introduction complementary feed , ensure adequate frequency feed diversity food use preparation . ) Selection train peer counsellor Women personal breastfeeding experience , least 6 year school , reside area , motivate work select become peer counselor . The WHO/UNICEF Breastfeeding Counseling Course adopt local language culture , already validate previous study [ 3 ] use train peer counselor . The training give 40-h ( 4-h daily 10 day ) . Counseling skill teach mainly demonstration role play include : listening mother , learn difficulty , assess position attachment baby breastfeed , build mother 's confidence , give support provide relevant information practical help require . During train course antenatal postpartum counsel practice pregnant woman , mother newborns infant age 1-12 month field site . The counselor also teach use locally available food complementary feed infant young child , best demonstrate food preparation skills mother . It anticipate peer counselor able support approximately 10 mother thus provide support approximately 1000 woman receive intervention ( see section 4.a . Sample Size Power detail ) 100 peer counselor ( four community cluster ) need recruit trained . The performance counselor monitor least four time course study Senior Infant Feeding Counselors . ii ) Counselling schedule : There schedule least 13 visit peer counsellor : two delivery ; four first month ; five monthly visit age 2 6 month ; three monthly visit age 9 12 month . The counsellor free make additional visit mother 's circumstance require . The counsel take place home ensure key family member ( e.g . mother-in-law father ) also include counselling session . The duration visit 20 40 minute . Antenatal visit : The peer counsellor two antenatal contact prepare mother , member family support delivery , importance hold baby within minute delivery initiate breastfeeding within one hour delivery . They discourage prelacteal feed fluid food lactation initiate . They encourage mother eat usual food support enhance lactation , appropriately rest third trimester . These meeting also cover problem breastfeed mother might encounter best deal . Visits first month life : The mother contact four time peer counsellor ( within 48 hour delivery , 5-7 day , 10-14 day 24-28 day ) . At visit exclusive breastfeed encourage mother 's specific need address . Issues could cover include sore nipple , problem attachment tot eh breast , baby 's position feed , family pressure start food mother ' doubt adequacy breastmilk . If issue could resolve mother could refer Senior Infant Feeding Counsellors . Visits 2 6 month life : The mother contact monthly peer counsellor . Specific problem address continued support exclusive breastfeeding provide especially deal family pressure introduce food concern adequacy growth infant . From 5 month age specific message include , importance complementary feeding , demonstration preparation complementary food introduce . Mothers give measure cup spoon two type complementary food demonstrate . The two type complementary feed promote base prior survey food give young child urban Dhaka . The first `` rice-suzi '' ( powdered rice + soybean oil make energy dense ) , second `` Khichri '' ( cooked rice + lentil + soybean oil ) . Mothers also discourage use bottle feed . Visits 6 12 month life : The mother contact twice 3 month interval peer counsellor . The mother encourage continue breastfeed support give adequate frequency complementary feed appropriate diversity food . There demonstration preparation complementary feed need . b . Management intervention There two senior infant feeding counsellor train peer counsellor supervisor CI-B . These senior counsellor provide technical support peer counsellor help resolve problem encounter implementation trial intervention regular meeting peer counsellor field . . There 10 field supervisor support day-to-day logistics administration field activity include support senior infant feed counsellor field per counsellor . To facilitate overall implementation process , advisory committee consist local health officer , local government official , representative mother ' group community , representative Bangladesh Breastfeeding Foundation , relevant NGOs project staff help guide research team meet every 3 month project progress . 3 . Evaluation plan 1 . Outcome assessment ) Key trial outcome Differences percentage stunt infant ( height-for-age &lt; -2 Z ) 6 , 12 18 month . Changes mean height-for age Z score birth till 18 month Changes percentage woman exclusively breastfeed ( breast milk food milk base liquid ) infants 3 6 month . Changes mean duration breastfeeding . Changes percentage woman bottle feed ( liquid semi-solid food bottle nipple/teat ) infants 9 12 month . Changes percentage child 6 &amp; 9 month receive solid , semi-solid soft food . Changes percentage child consume food &gt; 4 food group 9 , 12 , 15 &amp; 18 month . Changes mean intake food energy , protein , carbohydrate , fat select micronutrient complementary feed 9 , 12 , 15 18 month . ii ) Measurements 1 . Anthropometry : Trained research assistant collect anthropometric measurement ( weight height ) use establish method [ 9 ] record measurement research instrument infant growth chart mother hold.. These measurement standardize data collection . Anthropometry collect soon birth 3 month interval ( 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 18 month ) . The 2006 WHO Growth Standard use construct anthropometric index standard WHO recommend indicator use ass stunting ( Height-for-age &lt; -2 Z ) , waste ( weight-for-height &lt; -2 Z ) underweight ( weight-for-age &lt; -2 Z ) . 2 . Infant feeding practice : Standard question infant feeding practice use Bangladesh DHS survey [ 6 ] use monitor pattern 3 monthly data collection period birth till 18 month age . These include question current breastfeeding status , current use liquid solid food , time introduction liquid solid food , use bottle feed information provide advice infant feed amongst family friend . Ten percent interviewer 's schedule visit monitor one Senior Research Assistants Principal Investigators Investigators . The questionnaire check daily , information incomplete clear , supervisor return home next day complete data form . Mother 's report infant feeding practice verify 4-hour observation period take place unscheduled visit Senior Research Assistants Principal Investigators Investigators . 3 . Infant maternal morbidity Infant Morbidity Illness history diarrhoea , dysentery ( blood and/or mucus ) , fever cough , ear infection ( purulent discharge ) ear obtain 3 , 6 12 18 month use 2-weeks ' recall method . The question ask base standard DHS infant morbidity recall question expand include question ear discharge . Diarrhoea define episode passage three loose watery stool within 24 hour . Presence blood stool define invasive diarrhea . When single episode diarrhea last two week , call persistent diarrhoea . Acute respiratory illness define episode cough report fast rapid breathe difficulty breathe without fever . Maternal morbidity A simple recall method use assess morbidity mother . They ask recall , month precede interview , day ill enough usual daily activity restrict . If experienced restrict day illness ask key symptom ( cough , diarrhoea , urinary discomfort fever ) . A medical history collect baseline capture information maternal chronic illness well . The total number restrict day number restrict day fever used analysis relationship feeding practises . If maternal morbidity equally distribute across treatment group would expect factor would bias trial result . 4 . Dietary intake : Trained interviewer collect 24-hr dietary recall use standard method start 6 month age till 18 month . All food consume 24 hour prior interview record portion size measure local utensil . Recipes use prepare food record include amount raw food use preparation method . The food cod research assistant nutrient calculate special purpose program use Bangladesh Food Composition Tables . Both nutrient intake food group consume analyzed present . Duplicate 24 hour recall take 10 % subsample respondent ass within person variability allow adjustment prevalence low intake nutrient . 5 . Focus group discussion : A Focus Group Discussion ( FGD ) unique method qualitative research try find views people group interactive way . FGD conduct mother learn perception practice child feed dietary pattern . FGD focus - 1 . Perception colostrum , Timely Initiation Breast Feeding ( TIBF ) , Exclusive Breastfeeding ( EBF ) , continuation BF , complementary feeding . 2 . Constraints feed colostrum , EBF , continuation BF , complementary feeding . 3 . Perception , cause , possible consequence malnutrition mother experience day day life . 4 . The perception food security child like complementary feeding practice pattern adequacy breast feeding . 5 . Perception disease , service take illness . 6 . Beliefs appropriate type complementary feed The FGDs conduct mother 6 group intervention area 6 group control area randomly select community . Each FGD consist 6 8 participant , hold location time , convenient group . The FGD conduct 2 hour group . A trained Field Research Officer facilitate session . The group facilitator assist research personnel , record answer several broad category . She also record session use cassette player later transcription translation . The qualitative answer transform quantitative expression . The data focus group analyze extract essential issue term . A statistical program ATLAS ti use qualitative data analysis use 1 ) Free listing . 2 ) File sort 3 ) Rating . Dr. Sabrina Rashid anthropologist include study team ( consultant ) expertise qualitative data analysis . iii ) Schedule data collection 1 . A pilot study conduct first year study single cluster test recruitment method , implementation intervention evaluation instrument field method commence trial . 2 . Assessment trial outcome : A baseline survey enrollment use collect basic socio-demographic information family maternal characteristic . The detail birth pregnancy record shortly delivery . The trial outcome assessed series measurement take 3 monthly interval birth 18 month age . These include anthropometry , record dietary pattern dietary intake . 2 . Process assessment need examine fidelity , dose , reach intensity intervention : ) Participation mother peer counsel session ii ) Self report adherence peer counsel guideline peer counsellor iii ) Unscheduled observation peer counsellor home visit iv ) Focus group &amp; open end question mother &amp; peer counsellor program This data collect implementation intervention , focus group end intervention year .</detailed_description>
