	<brief_summary>More half under-five death Bangladesh occur first month life ( neonatal period ) , substantial proportion death due infection ( sepsis ) . According recently formulate Bangladesh National Neonatal Health Strategy ( NNHS ) , Government Bangladesh commit improve access quality management neonatal infection . The strategy emphasize health service provider level acquire skill manage sepsis . Responding recommendation National Neonatal Health Strategy , operation research seek evaluate alternative approach management neonatal sepsis community . The evaluation focus assess intervention coverage , provider quality care , referral referral compliance , undertake cost-benefit analysis community-based neonatal sepsis management . The programme evaluation within exist health service delivery system Bangladesh thus design inform effective scaling neonatal sepsis management contribute implementation NNHS . The intervention evaluate nested Maternal , Neonatal Child Survival ( MNCS ) programme implemented Government Bangladesh , partnership support UNICEF , several national NGOs . This operation research implement Government Bangladesh collaboration UNICEF , SNL - Save Children ( USA ) , Bangladesh Perinatal Society , ICDDR , B . It take place four MNCS programme upazilas , 10 union randomly select intervention 10 union comparison . The intervention consist train community health worker , village doctor health facility worker manage neonatal sepsis addition essential newborn care training . In comparison area health worker receive essential newborn care training . The intervention evaluation continue least 18 month , roll survey two special survey 6 12 month project .

	<detailed_description>Three four MNCS programme upazilas purposively select study consultation GoB partner . The likely district three four upazilas select include Sunamganj , Kishoreganj , Bandarban Sherpur . However , may change depend GoB/UNICEF decision MNCS scale-up . The upazilas select consider presence NGO partner ability implement intervention , start MNCS upazilas 2009 overlap similar programme research project . Twenty union ( average population 20,000 ) identify select upazilas randomly assign intervention comparison . Unions substantial urban population exclude . In order achieve balance randomisation across upazilas , investigator make effort select even number union select upazilas . Study design A cluster-randomised design use . Of 20 selected union select sub-districts/upazilas , 10 randomly assign intervention 10 comparison , , 200,000 population ( ~40,000 household ) arm . In intervention comparison union , common MNCS intervention package uniformly implement , include train community-based health worker essential newborn care . Details MNCS intervention package delivery system find Annex I . All MNCS upazilas also already implement facility-based IMCI . The objective randomisation ensure balance intervention comparison area term population geographical characteristic coverage health intervention programme . The sample unit ( union ) stratify accord upazila . If union total population le 12,000 ( minimum require obtain adequate sample neonate ) either exclude exclusion result few 20 union available randomisation two small union merge consider single sample unit . Equal number union intervention comparison select upazila . Within upazila , union pair distance upazila health complex member pair randomly select intervention comparison . In intervention union , addition routine MNCS service , service management neonatal sepsis make available community , target pregnant woman newborn bear within study period . Community-based management neonatal sepsis provide three type care provider : community health worker , village doctor community clinic care provider . The intervention evaluation continue least 18 month . Evaluation ongoing include roll household survey assess intervention coverage care-seeking referral compliance practice . In addition , two special survey conduct assess provider performance , referral compliance , quality care different level care , incremental program household cost . The first special survey conduct 6 month implementation intervention 12 month . The first round roll survey also include sample newborn bear previous 12 month assess baseline care-seeking pattern coverage neonatal sepsis .</detailed_description>
