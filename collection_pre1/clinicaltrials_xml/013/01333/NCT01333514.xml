	<brief_summary>Good sugar control postoperative hospitalize patient show improve wound heal infection rate . However , sugar control difficult achieve suboptimal use insulin think contributory factor . Though know generally consumption carbohydrates alone raise blood sugar , usual practice dose meal-time insulin base fraction total meal-tray eaten include protein , fat carbohydrate . This lead overestimation insulin require patient consumes portion mainly proteins fat tray underestimation eat mainly carbohydrates tray . Low sugar high blood sugar follow respectively . Hypothesis : The purpose study see dose meal-time insulin base gram carbohydrate consume result well sugar control compare usual practice dose meal-time insulin base percent total meal consume hospitalized patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>100 research subject expect enrolled study , recruit Rush University Medical Center surgical ( non-critical ) service . As usual care Rush University Medical Center , patient type 2 diabetes insulin least two oral diabetes medication give insulin inpatient stay control blood sugar . It normal practice use insulin hospital instead pills treat diabetes . The use insulin would temporary hospital stay . When return home , resume use pill . Before study begin , computer system randomly assign number , number belong one two group . The number give determine group go . Throughout study , give standard dose basal insulin ( Lantus ) . This dose home dose already use insulin . If use insulin , give dose base weight . During stay , give meal tray breakfast , lunch , dinner , food item belong meal tray mark certain number carbohydrate . For example , Â½ cup cottage cheese contain 4 gram carbohydrates one slice whole wheat bread contain 14 gram carbohydrates one 5 oz apple contain 21 gram carbohydrate . A dietician count total amount carbohydrate consume meal . If assign investigational arm study , give dose mealtime insulin ( Aspart ) base number carbohydrate consume . If assign control arm , give standard dose mealtime insulin , eat 50 % tray usual practice Rush , regardless much carbohydrate eat . This dose home dose already use insulin calculate base weight . In either arm , meal give ( due additional procedure reason ) insulin dose give . For arm study , request eat snack contain carbohydrate . Instead may request snack contain carbohydrate string cheese investigator provide . Response therapy monitor fingerstick glucose reading , also call point-of-care glucose . Your nurse draw capillary blood , ( less 1 ml ) via fingerstick 4 occasion : pre-breakfast , pre-lunch , pre-dinner , post-dinner / bedtime . These value send study investigator , adjust amount insulin give . In addition , doctor check blood test call A1c . This test measure average sugar level blood last 90 day . This test do patient diabetes hospitalize .</detailed_description>
