	<brief_summary>This comparative pilot study design compare rate gastric empty inference rate digestion two food emulsion . Two type milk protein stabilise food emulsion compare , one standard emulsion preparation one emulsion preparation cross-linked microbial transglutaminase . The information study compare data satiety endocrine hormone parallel study undertaken Finland use two meal formulation . The drink label stable isotope carbon sample breath collect every 20 minute consumption drink . This allow gastric residence time calculate . The pilot also fulfill two secondary objective . At time breath sample collect MRI scan upper abdomen make gastric volume measure order compare two method measure gastric empty rate . Additionally , sample saliva also collect every MRI scan subsequent mass spectrometry analysis . These assess efficacy mass spectrometry analysis detection presence specific digestion relate hormone ghrelin .</brief_summary>
