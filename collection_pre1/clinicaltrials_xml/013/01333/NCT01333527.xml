	<brief_summary>Shoulder rotator cuff ( RC ) tear significant cause pain disability . Surgery do reconnect torn RC tendon ( ) bone . The goal RC surgery decrease pain , increase range motion ( ROM ) strength . This do arthroscopically ; small incision patient 's shoulder . After surgery , patient usually place sling 6 week protect repair shoulder tendon . During time , ROM exercise do use un-operated arm assistance . Voluntary active shoulder movement usually permit allow repaired tendon heal . Unfortunately , patient develop shoulder stiffness wear sling , delay rehabilitation . Any delays rehabilitation may result reduce shoulder function , slow return-to-work daily activity , may also impact health care system , increase use cost rehabilitation . This study 's purpose determine patient safely stop wear sling early pain comfort allow follow RC surgery . A total 200 patient ( 100 per group ) randomly assign one two study group : Patients Group A ( accelerate rehab ) wear sling comfort follow surgery . Self-assisted ROM exercise allow time . This mean patient may stop wear sling pain comfort allow , start active movement activity daily live . Patients Group B ( standard rehab ) wear sling 6 week . Like group A , self-assisted ROM exercise allow time , active movement allow 6 week surgery . Patients group give self-assisted ROM exercise surgery . Patients agree participate study see surgeon study physical therapist/research coordinator 6 occasion ( pre-surgery , 2 week , 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 month post-surgery ) . Each visit take 30 minute include ROM assessment , strength assessment ( appropriate ) disease-specific quality life questionnaire . Patients also undergo Ultrasound exam verify RC repair intact 12-months . Differences ROM , strength , questionnaire score , RC integrity , adverse event examine two group . Differences also examine accord RC tear size patient characteristic .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patient 18 year age 2 . Patient attempt nonoperative treatment ( i.e . physical therapy consist progressive ROM , strengthen , postural exercise ) 3 . Patient fullthickness tear supraspinatus and/or infraspinatus , confirm appropriate diagnostic imaging ( MRI , Arthrogram , Ultrasound ) 1 . Patient fullthickness tear subscapularis and/or teres minor 2 . Patient undergone previous RC surgery affect shoulder 3 . Patient major joint trauma , infection , avascular necrosis 4 . Patient chronic dislocation , inflammation , degenerative glenohumeral arthropathy 5 . Patient evidence significant cuff arthropathy ( superior glenohumeral translation and/or acromial erosion , diagnose diagnostic imaging ) 6 . Patient psychiatric illness , cognitive impairment , health condition ( i.e . visual impairment ) preclude informed consent render patient unable complete study questionnaires 7 . Patient major medical illness life expectancy le 2 year 8 . Patient speak/read/understand English 9 . Patient fix address mean contact 10 . Surgeon patient decide cancel surgery 11 . Surgeon conclude arthroscopic repair appropriate time surgery ( base RC tear characteristic concomitant shoulder pathology ) 12 . Patient unwilling complete necessary followup</criteria>
