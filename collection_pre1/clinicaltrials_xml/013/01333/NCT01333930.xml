	<brief_summary>The aim study : - Characterisation immunological effect Active O2 vs. placebo ingestion post standardise strenuous exercise - Characterisation safety tolerability Active O2 comparison placebo ingestion post standardise strenuous exercise consider Adverse Events observe study Moreover , suitability study design shall investigate mean internal pilot part , i.e . concern applied procedure , select pharmacodynamic parameter blood sample scheme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Placebo Controlled Study Characterisation Immunological Effects Safety Active O2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The nutritional product Active O2 ( Adelholzener Alpenquellen GmbH ) table water contain oxygen amount 40 mg/l , 15-fold high amount compare non-oxygenised product . In study evaluation immunological parameter characterise function immune system plan subject ingest test product Active O2 comparison placebo group . The study rationale refers establish mechanistic hypothesis , link gastro-intestinal hypoxia strenuous exercise impairment immune system function . During period exercise physiological stress situation , body primarily focus blood supply cardiovascular system , skeletal muscle skin . Therefore , assume immunological effect strenuous exercise relate - least part - reduce blood flow splanchnic organ turn lead hypoxia induced damage intestinal tissue , particularly mucosal tissue , enhance permeability pathogen [ 1-6 ] . A phenomenon well describe scientific literature relate athlete suffer infection , particularly upper respiratory tract , strenuous exercise . Significantly high endotoxin concentration ( lipopolysaccharides ) could detect blood athlete strenuous competition compare control group [ 7 ] . In scientific study , decrease number circulate immune cell well reduce host defence function strenuous sustain exercise demonstrate in-vivo application immunological in-vitro method . Significant decrease T-lymphocytes , T-helper cell type 1 well Natural Killer cell ( NK ) could show . However , B-cells T-helper cell type 2 affected comparable magnitude [ 8-10 ] . In one study significant increase regulatory T-cells ( Treg ) assess 45 min swim exercise adolescent [ 11 ] . These cell play major role inhibition effector T cell function thus pronounce immunosuppressive effect . Furthermore , show Treg-cell activity directly link occurrence hypoxia damage tissue [ 12 ] . Immune response due exercise complex depend numerous additional factor ( e.g . stress hormone , reactive oxygen specie ) well intensity exercise level [ 13-15 ] . Nonetheless , oxygen susceptibility regulatory immunocompetent cell well integrity mucosal barrier function may play important role protection and/or modification immune response include integrity epithelial tight junction M-cell related transcytosis pathogens highly organise lymphoid structure effective immune response [ 4 ; 12 ; 16 ] . A strong correlation intestinal hypoxia strenuous exercise magnitude intestinal mucosa damage demonstrate plasma level surrogate parameter intestinal fatty acid bind protein ( I-FABP ) , specific biomarker mucosal damage small intestine [ 4 ; 17 ] . The hypothesis investigate study oxygen content Active O2 may - least part - compensate hypoxic situation surface gut wall , ingested exercise . Luminal supply oxygenate water potentially might protect mucosal tissue ischemia relate damage could modulate immune response . As consequence , overall situation immune system might improve . Such effect reflect pharmacodynamic parameter determine study . A first interim analysis previous pilot part study , include result 12 healthy subject , reveal statistically significant difference treatment leukocyte , CD8+-lymphocytes NK cell . Significant difference cytokine production additional immunological parameter detectable comparison treatment trend observed might indicate treatment effect . Therefore , second part clinical trial perform focus pharmacodynamic parameter pilot part statistically significant difference treatment observe . However , additional inclusion I FABP analysis consider reasonable surrogate parameter specifically reflect quantifiable impairment potential local oxygen effect intestinal mucosa barrier function . According EU regulation No 1924/2006 nutrition health claim make food , nutrition produce company must show scientific data substantiation prerequisite advertisement deal health relate claim [ 17 ] . Thus , clinical trial plan investigate potentially beneficial effect Active O2 ingest exercise .</detailed_description>
