	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) glaucoma among leading cause blindness western world . Elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) well know major risk factor glaucoma . In addition , grow evidence vascular factor , include arterial hypertension hypotension , may play role pathogenesis AMD glaucoma . To gain insight mechanism human primary goal present study . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) delivers three dimensional , volumetric reflectivity information transparent medium vivo . Moreover , image show high choroidal penetration resolution comparable histologic examination infrared light source use . Because non-invasive character , OCT provide ideal method diagnosis monitor retinal choroidal abnormality . The present study aim investigate whether choroidal thickness temporarily alter change IOP systemic hemodynamic parameter . IOP increase use suction cup technique , mean arterial blood pressure alter intravenously administer Phenylephrine Sodium-Nitroprusside .</brief_summary>
