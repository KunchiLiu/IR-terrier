	<brief_summary>This dose escalation study determine maximum tolerable dose Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein , PTHrP , Parathyroid Hormone , PTH , give safely one week healthy African-American volunteer . The investigator plan infuse low dos intravenous PTHrP PTH determine lead sustain progressive suppression bone formation occur humoral hypercalcemia malignancy ( HHM ) increase bone formation occur hyperparathyroidism ( HPT ) . Additionally , investigator assess direct influence PTHrP PTH vitamin D metabolism , marker bone turnover , fractional excretion calcium . These result compare previous study Caucasian volunteer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>One Week Comparison Study PTH PTHrP Infusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study expand upon early infusion study healthy Caucasian Asian volunteer continuous infusion PTH PTHrP give six- , 12- , 48 hour . These study demonstrate : 1 ) There dose-related increase 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D response PTHrP PTH multiple day . 2 ) There markedly attenuate vitamin D response PTHrP compare PTH , particularly second 24 hour . 3 ) The increase 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D almost certainly responsible great calcemic effect PTH compare PTHrP . 4 ) PTHrP obviously weak agonist 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D result suppression see Humoral Hypercalcemia Malignancy ( HHM ) . Thus , suppression 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D see HHM remain unexplained . In addition assess effect infusion PTHrP PTH calcium handle 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D , also measure effect marker bone turnover . Given clinical observation see primary hyperparathyroidism ( HPT ) HHM , anticipate PTH would stimulate bone resorption formation , PTHrP would stimulate bone resorption inhibit formation . However , observed infusion PTHrP PTH result equivalent , rapid increase bone resorption measure N-telopeptide ( NTx ) C-telopeptide ( CTx ) , well progressive decline bone formation . There difference PTH PTHrP . Because finding , surmise infusion long duration would lead increase bone formation 1,25 ( OH ) 2D production peptide , see HPT . Very recently , complete seven-day infusion model healthy Caucasian Asian volunteer test hypothesis ( J . Bone Min . Res. , 2011 ) . A total 22 individual give either seven-day infusion PTH PTHrP , maximal safe dos find 2 4 picomoles ( pmol ) /kg/hour , respectively , low dos use previous , briefer infusion study . All patient develop sustained mild hypercalcemia ( mean = 10.3 mg/dL ) hypercalciuria rapid increase bone resorption . Surprisingly , bone formation suppress entire seven day robust rebound bone formation cessation respective peptide . This consistent may occur lactation HHM , contrary occurs HPT . The previous infusion study do Caucasian Asian volunteer extensively document physiologic difference bone metabolism African-Americans Caucasians . Much racial difference note bone metabolism come osteoporosis literature . African-Americans know high bone mineral density ( BMD ) low risk develop fragility fracture . There many factor may explain racial difference bone metabolism , include altered calcium economy , vitamin D difference , peak attain bone mass , muscle mass obesity , mechanism fall , remodel rate , bone micro-architecture , hip axis geometry , unknown hereditary difference . It also well establish African-Americans average , low 25-OH vitamin D concentration thus high PTH level . Despite elevation PTH , paradoxically increase bone loss indicate relative skeletal resistance PTH may exist . We hope perform seven-day infusion protocol healthy African-American volunteer learn racial difference bone turnover , renal calcium , PTH concentration , vitamin D metabolism , skeletal response lactation under-studied population . Ninety healthy African-American men woman screen eight-day inpatient admission Clinical &amp; Translational Research Center ( CTRC ) . Sixty evaluable research participant receive seven day infusion predetermine dose either PTHrP PTH . Vital sign blood urine test monitor frequently per study flow sheet . The start dose either peptide , 2 picomoles ( pmols ) /kg , give three normal healthy subject . Via dose escalation protocol , dose escalated increment successive group three subject , early adverse effect ( mild hypercalcemia , postural hypotension , tachycardia ) see . This determine safe dose give 10 subject . This dose escalation study design use several prior study institution order achieve sustain mild serum hypercalcemia 10.5-11 mg/dL range research study . The investigator study try determine safe dose PTHrP PTH African-American volunteer determine population physiologic response Caucasians . Subject population consist healthy young African-American adult , age 24-35 . It anticipate need screen 90 patient order obtain 60 evaluable subject .</detailed_description>
