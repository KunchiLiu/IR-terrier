	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine reduction total amount sedative critically pediatric ill patient receive PICU achieve significant decrease mechanical ventilation day decrease overall length stay PICU hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cycling Sedative Infusions Critically Ill Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Continuous sedative infusion associate long duration mechanical ventilation , long stay intensive care unit ( PICU ) total hospital stay . Also , extend duration continuous sedative infusion limit ability ass adequate neurologic function . There , however , publish data use daily interruption continuous sedative infusion pediatric patient , recommendation lead pediatric critical care group regard issue . Infants child expose noxious stimulus ( endotracheal tube , endotracheal suctioning , mechanical ventilation , indwell catheter ) addition unknown environment less likely cooperate normal daily intervention PICU . Continuous infusion benzodiazepine opioids addition need ( PRN ) bolus dose standard care institution mechanically ventilated patient . The study seek determine reduce total dose sedative , hold cyclical manner , safe effective intervention increase adverse patient outcomes . This achieve limiting patient tolerance sedative , decrease body total deposit sedatives subsequently decrease awakening time patient ready extubation .</detailed_description>
