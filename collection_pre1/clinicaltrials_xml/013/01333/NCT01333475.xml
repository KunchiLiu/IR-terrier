	<brief_summary>Background : - MK-2206 AZD6244 ( Selumetinib ) experimental cancer treatment drug block effect certain protein cancer cell need grow survive . These drug may effective treatment type colorectal cancer respond relapsed standard treatment . Researchers interested study MK-2206 AZD6244 affect level certain protein colorectal cancer tumor , well drug work cancer cell examine cell tumor sample collect drug give drug give . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness MK-2206 AZD6244 individual advance colorectal carcinoma respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose advanced colorectal carcinoma respond least one type standard chemotherapy . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , tumor image study . - Participants take MK-2206 AZD6244 mouth 4-week cycle treatment , one dose MK-2206 per week one dose AZD6244 every day . ( If participant negative side effect medication , dos adjust small dose ) . Participants keep diary record dose keep track side effect . - During treatment , participant regular visit clinical center , involve blood urine test , tumor biopsy , examination monitor effect treatment . Participants image study every two cycle ( 8 week ) study cancer 's response treatment . - Participants continue cycle treatment long treatment continue effective side effect severe enough stop participation study ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - The PI3K-AKT ( protein kinase B ) RAF/MEK ( methyl ethyl ketone ) /ERK ( extracellular-signal regulate kinase ) pathways two frequently activate signal pathway cancer , include colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . KRAS ( Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog ) mutation detect approximately 40 % patient CRC predict resistance EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) inhibitor . AKT upregulated approximately 60 % CRC . - Preclinical study demonstrate activate mutation PI3K-AKT pathway increase phosphorylated Akt MEK-EGFR-PI3K feedback loop implicate resistance antitumor effect MEK inhibition . - MK-2206 AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate selective inhibitor human AKT MEK , respectively , preclinical clinical anti-tumor activity single agent combination variety drug . Combination treatment mouse cancer model harbor mutation PI3K RAS ( Rat Sarcoma ) pathways potent compare either agent use alone , result substantial tumor inhibition , include tumor regression . The combination study Phase I trial appear tolerable . Primary Objectives : - Determine reduction pERK pAKT tumor biopsy C1D1 ( cycle 1 day 1 ) post-administration combination AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate MK-2206 patient advance colorectal cancer , stratify KRAS mutation status . - Evaluate recovery pAKT level tumor biopsy sample obtain C1D4 ( cycle 1 , day 4 ) administration combination AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate MK-2206 patient advance colorectal cancer , stratify KRAS mutation status . - Determine reduction Ki-67 tumor biopsy post-administration combination AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate MK-2206 patient advance colorectal cancer , stratify KRAS mutation status . Secondary Objectives : - Evaluate reduction pERK pAKT peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) administration combination AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate MK-2206 correlate reduction see tumor biopsy sample . - Evaluate antitumor activity combination MK-2206 AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate . Eligibility : -Patients histologically document colorectal cancer progress recur oxaliplatin- irinotecan-based chemotherapy metastatic disease . KRAS mutation analysis result must available prior enrollment . Patients must disease amenable biopsy , willing undergo pre-and post-treatment tumor biopsy . Study Design : - MK-2206 135 mg PO ( mouth ) weekly AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate 100 mg PO ( mouth ) daily administer 28-day cycle , begin C1D1 ( cycle 1 , day 1 ) . - Patients stratify KRAS mutation status . - Blood sample pair mandatory tumor biopsy obtain pharmacodynamic study . - CT ( compute tomography ) scan perform every 2 cycle restaging .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically confirm metastatic colorectal cancer , recur progress follow oxaliplatin irinotecanbased chemotherapy regimen administer treatment metastatic disease , except patient candidate either agent refuse treatment oxaliplatin irinotecan . The diagnosis must confirm Laboratory Pathology Clinical Center , NIH ( National Institutes Health ) , prior patient enrollment . Results KRAS ( KirstenRas ) mutation analysis must available prior patient enrollment . Patients must disease amenable biopsy , must willing undergo pre posttreatment tumor biopsy . Patients must complete major surgery chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologic therapy great equal 4 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior administration study drug exploratory IND ( investigational new drug ) /Phase 0 study . Patients must recover eligibility level prior surgery , toxicity , adverse event . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use MK2206 combination AZD6244 patient less 18 year age , child exclude study . Life expectancy great 3 month . ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) performance status less 2 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/microL Platelets great equal 100,000/microL Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 time institutional ULN ( upper limit normal ) AST ( aspartate aminotransferase ) /ALT ( alanine aminotransferase ) less equal 3.0 time institutional ULN ; le equal 5.0 time institutional ULN liver metastases Creatinine le 1.5 time ULN ; OR Measured creatinine great equal 60 mL/minute patient clearance creatinine level great equal 1.5 time ULN INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) less equal 1.4 PTT ( partial thromboplastin time ) less equal 40 second unless due lupus anticoagulant The effect MK2206 AZD6244 develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 4 week dose study medication cease . However , adequate contraception male patient use 16 week post last dose due sperm life cycle . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior entry . Patients must able swallow whole tablet capsule . Tablets must crush chewed ; capsule must open . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients receive investigational agent . Patients know brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis exclude clinical trial , exception patient whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable great equal 4 week treatment brain metastasis , without steroid .
