	<brief_title>PET Scan Imaging Assessing Response Patients With Esophageal Cancer Receiving Combination Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To induce complete pathologic response ( pCR ) rate 20 % positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan non-responders treat either induction FOLFOX carboplatin/paclitaxel , crossover regimen radiotherapy . Secondary - To compare PET/CT response induction treatment arm . - To compare pCR induction treatment arm among PET/CT scan responder . - To directly compare pCR induction treatment arm among non-responders treatment regimen find efficacious . - To determine 8-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) PET/CT scan responder , non-responders treat alternative crossover chemoradiotherapy . - Estimate PFS overall survival ( OS ) curve , overall among PET responder PET/CT non-responders induction treatment . - To determine rate postoperative anastomotic leak neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow chemoradiation . - To evaluate immunohistochemistry RT-PCR ERCC1 , genetic polymorphism ERCC1 , XPD , XRCC1 . - To evaluate status level methylation nine candidate biomarker gene well expression level select specific microRNAs , correlate chemoradiation response . - To compare quality life ( QOL ) responders nonresponders ( determine PET/CT scan ) presurgical treatment esophageal cancer , term global QOL , physical symptom , physical functioning , emotional well-being . - To examine association OS QOL esophageal cancer patient treat chemotherapy , chemoradiation therapy , surgery . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord T-stage ( T1-2 v T3-4 ) nodal status ( N0 v N+ ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive modify FOLFOX-6 therapy comprise oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 3 course . Patients undergo PET/CT scan . Patients responsive disease ( tumor metabolic activity decrease ≥ 35 % ) receive 3 additional course FOLFOX-6 therapy undergo concurrent radiotherapy ( RT ) ( 3D-conformal intensity-modulated ) daily , 5 day week , approximately 6 week . Patients without responsive disease ( tumor metabolic activity decrease 35 % ) cross arm II RT . - Arm II : Patients receive carboplatin IV 30 minute paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course . Patients undergo PET/CT scan . Patients responsive disease ( tumor metabolic activity decrease ≥ 35 % ) continue receive carboplatin IV 30 minute paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly 5 week undergo RT ( 3D-conformal intensity-modulated ) day , 5 day week , approximately 6 week . Patients without responsive disease ( metabolic activity decrease 35 % ) cross arm I RT . Within 4-10 week completion neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy , patient undergo surgery discretion treat team . Patients may undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study correlative study . Patients may also complete quality-of-life questionnaire baseline periodically study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
