	<brief_title>Low-frequency Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation To Enhance Motor Recovery In The Subacute Phase After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke major cause disability worldwide . Hand motor impairment frequent stroke . Even mild impairment upper limb negatively impact disability quality life patient significantly contribute disability . Therapeutic alternative hand motor rehabilitation deeply need . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) emerge potential tool improve hand motor performance stroke . While high-frequency rTMS ( HF-rTMS ) often increase motor cortical excitability , LF-rTMS often opposite effect . Up-regulation excitability affect hemisphere HF-rTMS down-regulation UH LF-rTMS restore balance inter-hemispheric inhibition hence , facilitate movement paretic hand Both strategy , well combination , yield encouraging result apply proof-of-principle , single-session study patient mild hand motor impairment subacute chronic stage stroke . However , rTMS study include patient less six month stroke , effect LF-rTMS unaffected hemisphere patient severe motor impairment subacute phase yet report . The investigator opt novel approach enhance hand motor recovery , examine feasibility , safety preliminary efficacy either active sham LF-rTMS UH sham rTMS add-on therapy outpatient customary rehabilitation , patient mild severe hand paresis , within 5-45 day unilateral ischemic stroke . The investigator hypothesize , stage , LF-rTMS feasible even patient severe motor deficit , minimal adverse event enhance effect customary rehabilitation hand motor performance .</detailed_description>
