	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine NAC , add exist antipsychotic treatment , superior placebo cortical erosion patient early stage psychosis . The primary hypothesis significantly less cortical erosion measure cortical thickness , cortical volume cortical white matter density ( assessed DTI ) patient treat 12 month NAC compare treat placebo . The secondary objective study determine 12 month NAC add-on treatment superior placebo fMRI determine work memory semantic memory task , cortical MR spectroscopy measure ( glutathione , N-acetylaspartate , glutamine/glutamate level ) , electrophysiologically determine attention measure ( e.g. , mismatch negativity , P300 ) , symptom , functional measure cognitive functioning .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect N-Acetyl Cysteine Cortical Erosion Early Stage Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia severe , debilitate illness typically begin teen-age year early twenty , worsens time evolve chronic , life-long disorder . Existing treatment suppress psychotic symptom prevent evolution underlie disease process result poor , long term outcome . Recent study show progressive erosion cortical mass occur early stage schizophrenia ( 1-3 ) . The investigator hypothesize arrest cortical erosion early phase schizophrenia prevent subsequent clinical deterioration descend course illness associate disorder . The investigator propose establish research program ass ability agent neuroprotective property halt cortical loss thereby prevent subsequent clinical deterioration . N-acetyl cysteine ( NAC ) attractive molecule propose study two mechanistic property . First , establish neuroprotective agent . NAC precursor glutathione primary detoxifier reactive oxygen radical molecule damage neuronal tissue ( 4-6 ) . Glutathione deficiency well document schizophrenia ( 7 , 8 ) . Second , NAC modulate glutamate release . NMDA hypofunction alter glutamate release hypothesize contribute cortical atrophy observe early stage schizophrenia ( 9 , 10 ) . NAC show antagonize phencyclidine ( PCP ) effect increase frontal glutamate level induction social isolation rodent ( 11 ) . PCP pharmacological model schizophrenia . In controlled clinical trial patient chronic schizophrenia , NAC improve mismatch negativity , pre-attentive measure cortical information processing consistently implicate pathophysiology schizophrenia show correlate cortical erosion early stage patient ( 12 , 13 ) . In double-blind , placebo control clinical trial chronic schizophrenic patient , NAC significantly improve general psychopathology score , negative symptom extrapyramidal symptom ( 14 ) . NAC well tolerate significant effect safety parameter adverse event . The favorable tolerability NAC demonstrate recent study conduct IUSM Riley Hospital child ( age 4 12 year ) autism relatively high dos ( dose range 900 4200 mg/day ) serious adverse event report NAC well tolerate ( 15 ) . The investigator propose determine NAC disease modify potential early stage schizophrenia . The investigator hypothesize NAC improve measure cortical integrity early stage schizophrenia brain effect related improvement negative symptom cognitive functioning . Primary outcome measure trial serial assessment cortical integrity use magnetic resonance structural ( cortical thickness , cortical volume , diffuse tensor imaging , DTI ) . In addition investigator assess possible effect NAC treatment parameter link cortical erosion include fMRI couple work memory semantic memory task , MR spectroscopy ( cortical glutathione , N-acetylaspartate , glutamine/glutamate level ) electrophysiological measure ( e.g. , mismatch negativity , P300 ) . The investigator also determine relationship effect NAC negative symptom , positive symptom , functional status , cognition ( BACS ) , safety parameter ; brain index .</detailed_description>
