	<brief_title>Trabectedin Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer After First-Line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess therapeutic activity trabectedin , term progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 6 month , patient metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma progress gemcitabine-containing first-line chemotherapy . Secondary - To assess safety profile drug . - To assess response rate response duration . - To assess overall survival patient . - To assess PFS rate 9 18 week . - To perform blood , plasma , tumor tissue sample biological study , order identify biomarkers predictive resistance sensitivity trabectedin , characterize impact pharmacogenomic pharmacokinetic profile anti-tumor activity translational research study . OUTLINE : Patients receive trabectedin IV 3 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample tumor tissue analyze identify biological marker predictive resistance treatment pharmacogenomic pharmacokinetic profile anti-tumor activity translational research study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
