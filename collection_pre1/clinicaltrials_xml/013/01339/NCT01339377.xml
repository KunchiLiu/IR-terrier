	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety effectiveness AO-1000 device treat relieve pain symptomatic subject contain herniated disc . This single-arm pilot study use go vs. no-go decision perform randomized-controlled trial . The study 's primary effectiveness objective demonstrate patient 's functionality ( base Oswestry Disability Index score ) improve baseline one month . The study 's primary safety objective demonstrate serious device/procedure relate adverse event subsequent surgical intervention great literature control percutaneous disc decompression procedure discharge , 1 month , 6 month , 12 month post-treatment . Secondary objective demonstrate procedural success improvement pain function subject 1 , 6 , 12 month use VAS ODI scale well track analgesic medication use . Pain function score follow-up time compare baseline score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Effectiveness Study AO-1000 Device Treat Contained Herniated Discs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The AO-1000 device provide oxygen-ozone treatment contain herniated disc . An oxygen-ozone treatment minimally invasive injection treat disc herniation widely practice Europe Asia . This treatment involve injection oxygen-ozone mixture herniated disc and/or paravertebral muscle surround disc . However , medical ozone generator procedure currently clear FDA use US . Many study use wide range inclusion/exclusion criterion , ozone concentration , procedure perform determine effectiveness oxygen-ozone treatment . A meta-analysis nearly 8,000 patient publish study show mean improvement 39 mm VAS 25.7 ODI . The likelihood complication 0.064 % . Furthermore , case discitis report oxygen-ozone therapy , unlike method disc volume reduction . This likely due fact ozone strong oxidizer excellent disinfecting agent . The complication show meta-analysis minor transient , easily avoidable utilizing device AO-1000 design eliminate type complication ( ozone leakage treatment room high ozone concentration ) procedure . The estimated complication rate meta-analysis consistent Italian Oxygen-Ozone Therapy Federation ( FIO ) result ( procedure-related adverse event treatment 15,000 patient ) . The safety direct injection oxygen-ozone gas mixture nucleus pulposus well establish study . Therefore , intent study obtain data confirm 2 weight percent ( wt % ) oxygen-ozone mixture deliver AO-1000 device safe effective intend use . This clinical study design bridge AO-1000 extensive prior oxygen-ozone treatment safety effectiveness data study find Meta-analysis use AO-1000 delivery system .</detailed_description>
