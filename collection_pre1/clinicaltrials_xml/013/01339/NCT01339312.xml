	<brief_summary>This study design gather safety immunogenicity data Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine - Serum Free ( VRVg ) , give post-exposure prophylaxis vaccination schedule , use Essen regimen , across different population . Primary Objective : - To demonstrate VRVg least immunogenic reference vaccine , Verorab vaccine , term proportion participant rabies virus neutralize antibody titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL Day 14 , i.e. , fourth vaccination , participant age 10 17 year participant age 18 year . Secondary Objectives : - To assess clinical safety VRVg vaccination administer post-exposure prophylaxis vaccination schedule respective age group overall - To describe immune response induce VRVg fourth vaccination 14 day last vaccination respective age group overall .</brief_summary>
