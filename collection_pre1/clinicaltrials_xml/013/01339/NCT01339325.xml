	<detailed_description>The aim study ass possible difference LESS approach standard laparoscopic approach cholecystectomy . In particular , Postoperative Quality Life ( QoL ) investigate analyze following : length hospital stay ( LoS ) , postoperative pain , cosmetic result SF 36 questionnaire . Furthermore , operative time , conversion standard LC rate , difficulty exposure , difficulty dissection , complication rate compare . Altman nomogram use calculate presumed sample size actual RCT , arbitrarily assume likely small standardize difference ( 0.3 ) . With significant criterion set 0.05 , use two-tailed test , number patient per group , require 90 % power ~500 . Therefore , decide carry pilot trial , enrol 40 patient ( 20 group ) , assess difference end-points tailor sample size large multicenter RCT accordingly . This dual-institutional prospective , randomized pilot trial conduct 2009 obtain information power sample size need plan multicenter randomize control trial . Our result show Quality life data concern LESS cholecystectomy somewhat controversial : cosmetic SF36 role emotional parameter significantly improve , difference find length hospital stay , early postoperative pain ( day surgery ) high impact need pain-relieving medication find . Altman nomogram use calculate presumed sample size actual RCT base difference find initial result . With significant criterion set 0.05 , use two-tailed test , number patient per group , require 90 % power multicenter RCT ~180 patient . Study design Randomization perform preoperatively stratification perform intraoperatively , visualization operative field . Patients randomize one three group : LESS cholecystectomy blind , standard LC , LESS cholecystectomy blind . Patients stratify 3 group : Nassar grade I , II , III , accord grade difficulty cholecystectomy ( Nassar score ) assess initial inspection operate field . Patients first two group know treatment receive discharge . A large drape use cover abdomen surgery , thus hide surgical wound . Patients LESS cholecystectomy blind group aware procedure undergo . The third arm intend well evaluate influence psychological factor postoperative pain , cosmetic quality life . All operation perform high-skilled laparoscopic surgeon ( one institution ) 15-year experience advance laparoscopic surgery . Difficulty ( impair ) exposure difficulty dissection assess subjectively operate surgeon score 1 4 , 1 `` difficulty '' , 4 `` difficult '' need conversion . Perioperative care similar patient institution . An independent physician ass patient postoperatively institution . Postoperative pain evaluate visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 1 10 , 1 `` least '' pain , 10 `` '' pain , day surgery , postoperative day 1 , 2 ( discharge ) 1-month follow-up . Pain also deduce assumption pain relieve medication . Patients receive pain medication demand give incremental strength begin peripheral analgesic Non-Steroidal Anti-Rheumatic agent ( NSAR ) . Individual satisfaction cosmetic result evaluate visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 0 100 % 0 `` bad '' result , 100 `` best '' one . Cosmetics also evaluate measure length umbilical incision end operation study group . The incision length measure gallbladder removal ( standard LC incision may enlarge allow passage thick gallbladder big stone ) . QoL assess time surgery assess postoperative month 1 SF36 questionnaire . Randomization Randomization perform prepare three set 30 number , opaque , seal envelope , envelops set contain indication 10 LESS cholecystectomy , 10 standard LC 10 LESS cholecystectomy blind . One set envelop keep involved Institution . The envelope open numeric order patient assistant involved surgical operation , right surgery . The surgeon perform standard LC LESS cholecystectomy ( blind blind ) indicate sheet inside envelope . Data analyse Data analyse use software XLSTAT Version 2009.5.01 ( Addinsoft ) . An `` intent-to-treat '' analysis perform . Patients demographic across treatment group compare chi-square test categorical measure , t-test continuous data . Mann-Whitney U test use compare LoS , postoperative pain VAS , cosmetic VAS , length skin incision , 8 parameter SF36 , operate time , difficulty exposure , difficulty dissection two arm . Chi-square test use compare conversion rate administration pain medication , dichotomize yes , three arm . All variable significant p &lt; 0.05 . Logistic model result report odds ratio , two-sided 95 % confidence interval , p value .</detailed_description>
