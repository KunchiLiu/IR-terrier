	<detailed_description>Objective This investigation focus two area : 1 ) early communication impairment predictor autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) later developmental delay , 2 ) relationship communication evidence CNS function ( sleep , EEG ) structure ( MRI DTI volumetrics ) young child risk ASD . The objective delineate early communicative impairment predict ASD vs. developmental delay examine impairment correlate brain abnormality structure function . Study Population We recruit 64 child [ n=32 12 month age ( plus minus 2 month ) ; n=32 18 month age ( plus minus 2 month ) ] at-risk ASD due communication/language delay ( at-risk group ) . The at-risk child match initial chronological age , SES , sex , typically develop child ( n=75 ) history developmental delay . These 139 participant hereafter refer toddler sample . At 36 month final visit , diagnostic status ( e.g . ASD , non-ASD specific delay , catch ) determine child at-risk group . In addition , 10 healthy adult , age 18-40 serve control participant purpose pilot functional paradigm MRI portion protocol . Design We propose conduct prospective , longitudinal study toddler at-risk ASD compare typically develop toddler . Children complete behavioral test overnight Sleep/EEG well MRI either 12 18 month initial . Follow-up visit include behavioral assessment occur 24 36 month child ( 18 month age 12-month cohort ) . The Sleep/EEG MRI repeat 36 month final follow-up . Outcome Measures Autism symptom , language status , cognitive development 36 month serve primary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
