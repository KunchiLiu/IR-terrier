	<brief_summary>Introduction Baylor College Medicine Texas Children 's Hospital recruiting individual MELAS syndrome clinical study . MELAS syndrome mitochondrial disease ; patient disease muscle weakness often develop brain stroke , blood flow normally different part brain . It believe stroke could due decrease production nitric oxide , naturally occur compound important normal blood vessel function . Nitric oxide make arginine citrulline normally find body . What purpose study ? The purpose study measure nitric oxide individual MELAS see give arginine citrulline increase formation nitric oxide . Nitric oxide think helpful preventing stroke . Therefore , arginine and/or citrulline show increase formation nitric oxide , could use prevent treat stroke patient MELAS syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>What study involve ? Individuals MELAS syndrome admit twice General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) Texas Children 's Hospital . Each time stay five day , special diet provide . Nitric oxide production measure stable isotope infusion technique involve place small tube vein ( IV catheter ) , blood sampling , inject harmless stable isotope . Stable isotope form normal compound measure accurately . They radioactive know risk give ; already part body small amount . During first admission nitric oxide level measure , arginine supplementation provide 48 hour , nitric oxide level re-measured determine effect arginine supplementation . During second admission , effect citrulline supplementation measure . Who participate study ? Adults child affect MELAS syndrome carrying DNA change cause condition ( 3243 A &gt; G mutation ) participate . Adults without MELAS disease recruit participate control subject . How get information ? Subjects interested participation get information contact Dr. Ayman El-Hattab email : elhattab @ bcm.edu , office phone : 832-822-4289 , cell phone : 646-660-5666 , pager : 832-824-7243 ( 5523 ) .</detailed_description>
