	<brief_title>BKM120 Fulvestrant Treating Postmenopausal Patients With Estrogen Receptor-Positive Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) BKM120 ( PI3K inhibitor BKM120 ) combination fulvestrant . II . To evaluate toxicity profile BKM120 combination fulvestrant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity profile BKM120 combination fulvestrant administer least 3 month . II . To determine steady state blood concentration BKM120 combine fulvestrant . III . To evaluate anti-tumor effect ( partial response [ PR ] , complete response [ CR ] , stable disease [ SD ] , progressive disease [ PD ] ) BKM120 combination fulvestrant patient ER+ metastatic breast cancer . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine baseline tumor specimen phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway abnormality , correlate treatment response . II . To examine PIK3 catalytic alpha polypeptide ( PIK3CA ) mutation status circulate deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) baseline follow study therapy correlate tumor tissue PIK3CA status treatment response . III . To determine effect study therapy fast C-peptide glucose . IV . To evaluate target inhibition BKM120 serial tumor biopsy collect follow study therapy . V. To evaluate effect BKM120 combination fulvestrant tumor cell proliferation apoptosis . VI . To obtain preliminary pilot data evaluate effect BKM120 tumor cell proliferation , measure FLT-PET/CT ( Phase IB ) OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study PI3K inhibitor BKM120 . Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 ( enrolled Phase IA Cohort C ) 5 day on/2 day schedule ( enrolled Phase IB ) . All patient receive fulvestrant intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 15 Cycle 1 day 1 subsequent cycle . Cycles repeat ever 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Two OPTIONAL FLT-PET/CT scan : first one do baseline start BKM120 second one do Day 16 Day18 BKM120 start . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
