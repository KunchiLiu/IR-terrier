	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination pazopanib vorinostat give patient advanced cancer . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Pazopanib Vorinostat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : Pazopanib design block growth blood vessel supply nutrient need tumor growth . This may prevent slow growth cancer cell . Vorinostat design cause chemical change different group protein attach DNA ( genetic material cell ) , may slow growth cancer cell cause cancer cell die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , 12 dose level pazopanib vorinostat test . Three ( 3 ) 6 participant enrol dose level combination pazopanib vorinostat . The first group participant receive low dose level pazopanib vorinostat . Each new group ( ) receive high combination dose pazopanib vorinostat group , intolerable side effect see . Participants may enrol 1-3 similar dose level pazopanib vorinostat time . You assign dose level base join study . This continue high tolerable dose ( ) study drug combination find . The dose study drug combination receive may lower intolerable side effect . Once high tolerable dose pazopanib vorinostat find , combination dose give expansion group 14 additional participant . Study Drug Administration : You take pazopanib vorinostat mouth 1 time day . Note take study drug time . You take pazopanib either 1 hour 2 hour eat meal . You take vorinostat food . Study Visits : Each study cycle 28 day . At study visit , ask drug may take side effect may . If able take blood pressure home , ask take blood pressure day participate study . Within 7 day first dose study drug : - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . - You ask well able perform normal activity daily live ( performance status ) . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Every week Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . During Week 1 cycle : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . At end Cycle 2 every 2-3 cycle : - You CT , MRI , PET scan , and/or x-ray check status disease . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . After Cycle 6 , require visit MD Anderson every 2 cycle get blood draw local doctor begin cycle . Talk study staff option . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You take study early disease get bad , intolerable side effect . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . End-of-Study Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug , end-of-study visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - If study doctor think need , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn measure tumor marker . - If study doctor think need , chest x-ray , CT , MRI , and/or PET scan check status disease . Up 174 evaluable patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
