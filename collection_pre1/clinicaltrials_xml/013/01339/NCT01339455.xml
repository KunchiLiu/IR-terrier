	<brief_summary>Neuromyelitis Optica ( NMO ) demyelinate degenerative disorder CNS affect vision spinal cord function . This disease rare compare Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) , devastate often lead accumulate disability 5 year-mortality approximately 30 % . Survivors typically leave severe morbidity secondary blindness , quadriparesis respiratory failure . No agent find highly effective halt disease activity . Based recent outcome stem cell transplant trial report autoimmune disease include MS , base mechanism NMO , anticipate stem cell transplantation may provide last disease stability NMO patient . The hypothesis present trial autologous hematopoetic stem cell transplantation patient NMO provide last benefit relapse prevention . Specifically , anticipate 50 % reduction proportion patient experience relapse three year period . We follow patient total five year transplantation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients deem eligible enrolled undergo two stage transplant process follow neurological assessment every 6 month follow 5 year assess EDSS , visual metric , MRI , AQP-4 antibody , MSFC SF36 .</detailed_description>
