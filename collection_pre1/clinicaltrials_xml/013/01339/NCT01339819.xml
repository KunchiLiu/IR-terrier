	<brief_title>Impact Dabigatran Phenprocoumon ADP Induced Platelet Aggregation Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral anticoagulation vitamin K antagonist ( OAC ) standard care reduce stroke patient atrial fibrillation . Just recently direct , competitive thrombin inhibitor dabigatran approve FDA stroke prevention patient atrial fibrillation . In large multicenter trial show dabigatran least effective Vitamin K antagonists prevention stroke without increase major hemorrhage . Approximately 6 % patient undergo coronary stenting need DAT aspirin clopidogrel need addition OAC reduction cardiac , cerebral systemic thromboembolic event . These patient therefore need triple therapy , therapy associate increase bleeding complication . Although phenprocoumon give solely without clopidogrel impact ADP induce platelet aggregation , show phenprocoumon significantly attenuate antiplatelet effect clopidogrel . ADP induce platelet aggregation measure multiple electrode platelet aggregometry ( MEA ) marker efficacy clopidogrel therapy ( ) low response ( AUC ≥ 468 ) clopidogrel associate increase ischemic event stent thrombosis ( ii ) patient enhance response clopidogrel ( AUC ≤ 188 ) high bleed rate . It therefore crucial evaluate whether additional antithrombotic therapy dabigatran alters ADP induce platelet aggregation patient . While show intravenous administration direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin reduces ADP induce platelet aggregation patient clopidogrel therapy , unknown whether dabigatran also impact ADP induce platelet aggregation . To evaluate impact dabigatran ADP induce platelet aggregation randomize patient atrial fibrillation need oral anticoagulation two-week treatment either dabigatran phenprocoumon hypothesize dabigatran superior phenprocoumon reduction ADP induce platelet aggregation . Patients concomitantly treat clopidogrel studied different trial similar study design ( Dabi ADP-2 ) .</detailed_description>
