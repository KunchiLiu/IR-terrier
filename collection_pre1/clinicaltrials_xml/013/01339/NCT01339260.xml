Scheduled receive first course anthracycline cyclophosphamide contain moderately emetogenic chemotherapy ( MEC ) regimen treatment solid malignant tumor : cyclophosphamide I.V . ( 500 1500 mg/m2 ) I.V . doxorubicin ( equal 40 mg/m2 ) cyclophosphamide I.V . ( 500 1500 mg/m2 ) I.V . epirubicin ( equal 60 mg/m2 ) . If schedule receive chemotherapy agent minimal low emetogenic potential could give day . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 . Female patient either nonchildbearing potential childbearing potential commitment use contraceptive method throughout clinical trial Hematologic metabolic status adequate receiving moderately emetogenic regimen base laboratory criterion ( Total Neutrophils , Platelets , Bilirubin , Liver enzymes , Serum Creatinine Creatinine Clearance ) The following inclusion criterion must check prior inclusion cycle MultipleCycle Extension : Participation study next cycle chemotherapy consider appropriate investigator Satisfactory study compliance precede cycle chemotherapy relate study procedure . Scheduled receive chemotherapy regimen cycle 1 Adequate hematologic metabolic status define cycle 1 If female , pregnant lactating . Current use illicit drug current evidence alcohol abuse . Scheduled receive highly emetogenic chemotherapy ( HEC ) Day 1 Day 5 moderately emetogenic chemotherapy ( MEC ) Day 2 Day 5 follow allow MEC regimen . Received schedule receive radiation therapy abdomen pelvis within 1 week prior Day 1 Days 1 5 cycle 1 . Any vomiting , retch , mild nausea within 24 hour prior Day 1 . Symptomatic primary metastatic central nervous system ( CNS ) malignancy . Active peptic ulcer disease , gastrointestinal obstruction , increase intracranial pressure , hypercalcemia , active infection uncontrolled medical condition ( malignancy ) , opinion investigator , may confound result study , represent another potential etiology emesis nausea ( chemotherapyinduced nausea vomiting , CINV ) pose unwarranted risk administer study drug patient . Known hypersensitivity contraindication 5HT3 receptor antagonist dexamethasone . Previously receive neurokin1 ( NK1 ) receptor antagonist Participation clinical trial involve oral netupitant administer combination palonosetron . Any investigational drug take within 4 week prior Day 1 cycle 1 , and/or schedule receive investigational drug study . Systemic corticosteroid therapy dose within 72 hour prior Day 1 cycle 1 . Scheduled receive bone marrow transplantation and/or stem cell rescue therapy . Any medication know potential antiemetic activity within 24 hour prior Day 1 cycle 1 Scheduled receive strong moderate inhibitor cytocrome P450 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) intake within 1 week prior Day 1 . Scheduled receive follow CYP3A4 substrate : terfenadine , cisapride , astemizole , pimozide . Scheduled receive CYP3A4 inducer intake within 4 week prior Day 1 . History predisposition cardiac conduction abnormality , except incomplete right bundle branch block .
