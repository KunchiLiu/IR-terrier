	<brief_summary>Plerixafor combination bevacizumab drug combination may stop cancer cell grow abnormally . Bevacizumab , also know Avastin , FDA approve use patient recurrent glioblastoma study extensively type solid tumor . Plerixafor , also know Mozobil , FDA approve use patient non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma multiple myeloma use treatment cancer . Information experiment laboratories suggest combination plerixafor bevacizumab may help prevent growth glioma . Part 1 : The investigator look high dose plerixafor give safely bevacizumab ( 21 day on/7 day regimen plerixafor ) . The investigator also blood test find body us breaks drug combination . Part 2 : The investigator look see plerixafor get past blood-brain barrier brain tumor . The investigator also blood test find body us breaks drug combination . Part 3 : The investigator look information : safety tolerability plerixafor combination bevacizumab ( 28 day on/0 day regimen plerixafor ) . The investigator also blood test find body us breaks drug combination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Plerixafor ( AMD3100 ) Bevacizumab Recurrent High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This study organize cycle . Each cycle last four week ( 28 day ) . Cycles occur back back without break . - Plerixafor give subcutaneous injection ( skin ) . The injection give approximately time day ( If participant would like option administer Plerixfor evening rather morning non-clinic day , possibility , provide certain condition meet ) . The research doctor specify day participant take plerixafor . In general , plerixafor give daily first three week every cycle ( part 3 , patient receive plerixafor last week cycle , well ) . For first week ( 5-7 day ) Cycle 1 , injection give clinic nurse teach participant spouse/friend/family member administer injection . - Bevacizumab ( 10 mg/kg ) give infusion Days 1 15 cycle . - During Part 1 investigator look high dose study drug administer safely combination bevacizumab everyone participates receive dose study drug . The dose give depend upon number participant enrol well tolerated dos . - During Part 2 , patient begin post-surgical cycle treatment , plerixafor administer daily 5-9 day MTD establish Part 1 study ; patient continue surgery ; recover surgery , patient begin post-surgical cycle treatment ( plerixafor bevacizumab ) MTD/regimen establish Part 1 study . - In addition take study medication , participant follow test procedure do : physical neurological exam , assessment tumor MRI CT scan , routine research blood test , routine urine test , pregnancy test ( applicable ) , ECG , collection cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) via spinal tap . - Participants may remain research study long tumor respond determine receive study drug safe .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis glioblastoma ( GBM ) , gliosarcoma , anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( AO ) , anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AOA ) . Patients eligible original histology lowergrade glioma . Unequivocal progression MRI CT Patients recurrence undergo resection leave without measurable evaluable disease eligible . Patients must recurrent disease may number prior relapse ( include prior relapse ) NONantiVEGF ( R ) contain regimen . Relapse define progression follow initial therapy . For patient progressed prior antiVEGF ( R ) contain regimen include bevacizumab , one prior relapse antiVEGF ( R ) contain regimen allow . 18 year age old Karnofsky performance status 60 great Normal organ marrow function outline protocol Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Protocol treatment must begin within 5 consecutive day registration Patients enrol Part 2 must willing undergo surgical resection sufficient pretreatment archival tumor tissue available molecular analysis Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour start investigational product . In addition , female subject childbearing potential male subject partner childbearing potential must agree use effective mean birth control study therapy minimum 4 month follow last plerixafor dose 6 month follow last bevacizumab dose . Effective birth control include : birth control pill , depot progesterone , intrauterine device plus one barrier method ; 2 barrier method . Effective barrier method male female condom , diaphragm , spermicide ( creams gel contain chemical kill sperm ) . Hormonal contraceptive method sufficient , information interaction plerixafor hormonal contraceptive know . Patients prior chemotherapy within past 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) . Patients must treatment Temozolomide least 23 day . Patients receive noncytotoxic drug therapy must treatment least 2 week . For patient enrol Part 1 Part 3 AND progress prior bevacizumabcontaining regimen , patient may continue treatment bevacizumab 10 mg/kg monotherapy , last dose bevacizumab administer few 14 day start Plerixafor bevacizumab . For participant enrol Part 1 Part 3 AND progress prior antiVEGF ( R ) ( bevacizumab ) contain regimen , patient must antiVEGF ( R ) treatment least 28 day receive Plerixafor bevacizumab . For patient enrolled Part 2 ( surgical substudy ) AND progress prior bevacizumab antiVEGF ( R ) contain regimen , patient must antiVEGF ( R ) treatment least 28 day prior surgery . NOTE : Participants must recover grade 0 1 clinically significant toxicity relate prior therapy ( exception lymphopenia , common therapy temozolomide ) . For patient receive prior bevacizumab antiVEGF ( R ) therapy , patient must NOT discontinue treatment regimen due treatmentrelated toxicity . In order prevent register patient pseudoprogression rather true disease progression , patient must receive form cranial radiation within 12 week study entry . NOTE : Patients receive cranial radiation within 12 week study entry allow register trial progressive disease confirm via biopsy . Major surgical procedure ( include craniotomy ) significant traumatic injury le 28 day receive minor surgical procedure ( e.g . core biopsy fine needle aspiration ) within 7 day . Patients may receive investigational agent within past 28 day . NOTE : If agent 's halflife x 5 &lt; 28 day , patient may take within last 28 day , provide least 5 halflives pass since last take . Patients prior therapy CXCR4 inhibitor . Patients one prior relapse bevacizumab antiVEGF ( R ) ( i.e . VEGFtrap , vandetanib , cediranib , sunitinib , sorafenib , XL184 , etc . ) contain regimen allow participate . Prior therapy thalidomide lenalidomide allow . Patients receive prior treatment implant radiotherapy chemotherapy source wafer polifeprosan 20 carmustine ( e.g . Gliadel wafer ) . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition plerixafor bevacizumab . For first 20 patient register , anticoagulation allow ; subsequent patient screen , patient require therapeutic anticoagulation warfarin baseline exclude ( however , therapeutic prophylactic therapy lowmolecular weight heparin acceptable ) . Patients must know coagulopathy increase risk bleed history clinically significant hemorrhage past . Patients whose MRI scan demonstrate intratumoral hemorrhage peritumoral hemorrhage eligible treatment deem significant treating physician . Patients gastrointestinal bleed hemorrhage/bleeding event CTCAE Grade &gt; /= 3 within 30 day prior study entry . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited uncontrolled hypertension , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients great 1+ proteinuria urine dipstick equivalent routine laboratory analysis require test urine protein creatinine ratio .
