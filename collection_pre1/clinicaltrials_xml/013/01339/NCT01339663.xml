	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose autologous T-antigen-presenting cell ( T-APC ) vaccine follow therapeutic autologous lymphocyte ( CTL ) cyclophosphamide treat patient metastatic melanoma . Aldesleukin may stimulate lymphocyte , CTL , kill melanoma cell . Treating lymphocyte aldesleukin laboratory may help lymphocyte kill tumor cell put back body . Vaccines make melanoma antigen may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell may boost effect CTL . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving T-APC vaccine CTL cyclophosphamide may effective treatment melanoma</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety toxicity T-APC vaccination follow adoptive T cell therapy . II . Evaluate functional numeric vivo persistence adoptively transfer cytotoxic lymphocyte ( CTL ) follow T-APC vaccination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate antitumor effect adoptive T cell therapy follow T-APC vaccination . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study T-APC vaccine . INFUSION I : Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -4 -3 low-dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) subcutaneously ( SC ) twice daily ( BID ) day 0-14 . Patients also receive CTL IV day 0 . INFUSION II : Beginning 6-48 hour later , patient receive high-dose cyclophosphamide , low-dose IL-2 , CTL Infusion I . Patients also receive T-APC vaccine IV within 18-36 hour follow CTL infusion week 4 , IL-2 SC BID day 0-14 follow second T-APC vaccination . After completion study treatment , patient follow 8 week .</detailed_description>
