	<brief_summary>BKM120 newly discover drug use research study . Information research study suggest BKM120 may help slow stop growth malignant glioma . The purpose study see well BKM120 work patient malignant glioma . Patients study treat two group : patient go receive surgery receive surgery . This study try determine effective BKM120 stop cancer cell grow . For patient receive surgery research also try determine effective level BKM120 penetrate brain surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study BKM120 Subjects With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For patient surgery , BKM take orally 8-12 day prior surgery . Prior surgery FDG-PET scan surgery sample tumor take research . Patients resume oral BKM120 14 35 day surgery . For patient surgery post-surgery patient , BKM120 take orally 28 day ( 1 cycle ) . Patients continue BKM120 long brain tumor get bad severe intolerable side effect . While study , patient routine blood test , physical examination , questionnaires assess mood ( cycle ) , well assessment tumor MRI CT ( ~ every 8 week ) , research blood sample various timepoints genetic study test measure additional effect study drug disease status . Participants may also require undergo electrocardiogram and/or MUGA scan monitor heart function study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must able understand willing sign write informed consent document . Subjects must able adhere dose visit schedule , agree record medication time accurately consistently daily diary . Participants must least 18 year old . Participants must Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) ≥ 60 . Nature illness treatment history Participants must histologically confirm glioblastoma variant . Participants eligible original histology lowgrade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis glioblastoma variant make . Participants may treatment 1 prior relapse ( NOTE : Relapse define progression follow initial therapy ( i.e. , radiation ± chemotherapy ) ) . The intent therefore patient 2 prior therapy ( initial treatment 1 relapse ) . If participant surgical resection relapse disease antitumor therapy institute 12 week , participant undergoes another surgical resection , consider second relapse . For participant prior therapy lowgrade glioma , surgical diagnosis highgrade glioma consider first relapse ) . Participants must show unequivocal evidence tumor progression MRI CT scan . For Cohort 2 , CT MRI within 14 day prior start study drug . MRIs include vascular image possible . For Cohort 2 , corticosteroid dose must stable decrease least 5 day prior scan . If steroid add steroid dose increase date screening MRI CT scan start treatment , new baseline MRI CT require . For Cohort 1 subject , CT MRI perform ideally within 14 day prior study registration , screen MRI subset subject use evaluation response , acceptable MRI/CT perform great 14 day prior registration unavoidable . Furthermore , reason , fluctuation corticosteroid dose around MRI warrant repeat scan long documented unequivocal evidence tumor progression available . For Cohort 2 , Immunohistochemical genetic analysis tumor tissue prior surgery must demonstrate activation PI3K pathway one following : PIK3CA mutation PIK3R1 mutation , PTEN negativity ( &lt; 10 % tumor cell stain ) oh immunohistochemistry , PTEN mutation ( ) , homozygous deletion PTEN Participants must fail prior radiation therapy must interval least 12 week completion radiation therapy study entry . Participants must recover grade 0 1 toxic effect prior therapy ( exception lymphopenia common therapy temozolomide ) . From project start schedule study treatment , follow time period must elapse : 4 week 5 halflives ( whichever short ) investigational agent , 4 week cytotoxic therapy ( except 23 day temozolomide 6 week nitrosoureas ) , 6 week antibody , 4 week 5 halflives ( whichever short ) antitumor therapy . Participants prior therapy include interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation progressive disease base upon nuclear imaging , MR spectroscopy , perfusion image histopathology . Participants undergone recent resection recurrent progressive tumor eligible Cohort 2 long follow condition apply : ) They recover effect surgery ; b ) Residual disease follow resection recurrent tumor mandate eligibility . To best assess extent residual disease postoperatively , MRI CT scan ideally perform later 96 hour follow surgery least 28days postoperatively , scan perform outside window consider acceptable alternative available . In either case , baseline/screening MRI must perform within 14 day prior registration . If participant take corticosteroid , dose must stable decrease least 5 day prior scan . If steroid add steroid dose increase date screening MRI CT scan start treatment , new baseline MRI CT require . Participants must sufficient tissue prior surgery confirmation diagnosis correlative study . Submission tissue occur within 30 day registration . The following amount tissue require : ) 25 unstained formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) section ( standard 45 micrometer thickness AND b ) one following : ) At least 200 microgram frozen tissue OR ii ) At least 10 ( preferably 20 ) unstained FFPE section 10 micrometer thickness OR iii ) At least 8 tissue core FFPE block ( 200 micrometer total thickness tissue block total surface area 0.5 cm2 ) Clinical laboratory test within 14 day prior enrollment meeting criterion list protocol Cardiovascular assessment : baseline MUGA Echocardiogram must demonstrate LVEF ≥ 50 % Electrocardiogram must demonstrate QTc interval le 480 msec Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g. , age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) six month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) , define woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective contraception ( define protocol ) study treatment 16 week study discontinuation . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screening within 48 hour prior dose study drug . Fertile male , define male physiologically capable conceive offspring , must use condom study treatment 16 week study discontinuation father child period . Female partner male study subject use highly effective contraception receive study agent 16 week final dose study therapy . Cohort 1 Inclusion Criteria ( In addition general eligibility criterion , participant Cohort 1 preoperative portion study must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible ) : A participant deem site Investigator appropriate candidate surgical resection may enrol Cohort 1 preoperative study . There must sufficient recurrent tumor allow least 400mg tissue collect ( 2 X 0.5 cm3 ) pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic analysis . Central Immunohistochemical analysis ( Dr. Ligon DFCI ) tumor tissue earlier surgery must indicate pAKT positivity ( 12+ 02+ scale ) . [ Cohort I patient ' tissue may also demonstrate activation PI3K pathway via one criterion list Cohort 2 participant , mandatory . ] Participants receive prior treatment P13K inhibitor , AKT inhibitor , mTOR inhibitor ( e.g . rapamycin , MK2206 , perifosine etc. ) .
