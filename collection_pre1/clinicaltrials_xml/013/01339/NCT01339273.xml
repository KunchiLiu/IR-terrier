	<brief_summary>Laparoscopic ( key-hole ) large bowel resection minimally invasive procedure compare open large bowel resection , still associate significant amount pain discomfort . Analgesia commonly provide multi-modal technique involve vary combination paracetamol , Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , regional analgesia oral parenteral opioids . While epidural analgesia consider gold standard open colo-rectal procedure associate significant complication may delay hospital discharge laparoscopic procedure . Opioids associate increased incidence nausea , vomit sedation reduce bowel motility also prolong recovery . Transversus Abdominis Plane ( TAP ) block technique numbs nerve carry pain sensation abdominal wall provide effective safe analgesia minimal systemic side effect . Their perceived benefit think relate reduce opioid consumption therefore reduce opioid side effect . The investigator believe ultrasound guide TAP block reduce pain morphine consumption resultant improve patient satisfaction , early return bowel function earlier hospital discharge . The key research question investigator try answer whether TAP block provide good pain relief local anaesthetic infiltration laparoscopic port site . Both technique currently use hospital retrospective audit demonstrate well analgesia low consumption morphine TAP block group.The difference statistically significant number patient audit large enough.The investigator hop study demonstrate difference real recruiting necessary number patient group ( 36 per group )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transversus Abdominis Plane ( TAP ) Block Postoperative Analgesia After Laparoscopic Colonic Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary Study Design The study double blind randomise controlled trial patient undergo laparoscopic right hemicolectomy laparoscopic high anterior resection randomly allocate two group , study group receive bilateral TAP block follow morphine PCA control group receive local anaesthetic infiltration laparoscopic port sit specimen extraction site morphine PCA . A double blind design choose eliminate patient observer bias report pain score . The presence control arm ensure difference observe due effect sensory nerve block due TAP block due systemic effect inject local anaesthetic . The null hypothesis difference group amount morphine consume patient 48 hour operation . We choose measurement objective indirect measurement efficacy TAP block pain relief thus receive . Measurement pain various score method reliable concurrent reduction consumption pain killer demonstrate . Recruitment randomisation : All patient meet inclusion criterion receive patient information leaflet invitation letter participate study pre-assessment visit . We aim recruit 72 patient ( 36 patient per group ) . Informed consent take one investigator morning surgery , exclusion criterion applicable . Patients allot consecutive participant number start one . Patients randomly allocate either study group control group . Randomisation occur use computer generate random number . Group allocation keep consecutively number , opaque , seal envelope control drug cupboard theatre-6 anaesthetic room Churchill hospital.Once patient consent , anaesthetist open corresponding number envelope perform bilateral TAP block induction general anaesthesia , patient study group surgeon infiltrate port site local anaesthetic end procedure patient control group . Blinding : The study group receive bilateral TAP block 20mls 0.25 % bupivacaine side skin puncture either side cover small plaster . Patients control group receive subcutaneous infiltration laparoscopic port sit specimen extraction site equivalent amount bupivacaine end procedure small plaster stick either flank approximately skin puncture TAP block make . The assessor pain score morphine dos ( Recovery nurse &amp; Colo-rectal house officer ) patient blind group allocation . Patient : Plasters stick flank patient study control group patient know receive TAP block . Recovery nurse : During handover recovery anaesthetist scrub nurse mention group allocation . Colo-rectal house officer : The house officer ( Junior Doctors ) follow ward present operate theatre , blind The study duration induction anaesthesia patient medically fit discharge hospital . No extra visit routinely required surgical procedure expect .</detailed_description>
