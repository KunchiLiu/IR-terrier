	<brief_summary>This study pilot trial evaluate effect support treadmill walk patient primary progressive multiple sclerosis ( MS ) functional psychosocial outcome . Patients exercise three time per week course 6 month evaluate baseline , 12 week 24 week program . Follow-up test also conduct 12 week participant stop exercise determine lasting effect intervention . The investigator hypothesize support treadmill walk effective improve physical physical function psychosocial outcomes patient primary progressive MS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use exercise adjunct disease modify treatment MS find increase support past decade . There ample evidence exercise therapy improve physical measure disability MS , addition safe well-tolerated . However , paucity data whether exercise equally effective primary progressive MS relapse remit MS . In addition , study exercise therapy traditionally exclude MS patient severe disability . There also currently treatments primary progressive MS , find safe disease-modifying therapy utmost importance . The investigator therefore conduct pilot trial evaluate effect exercise form support treadmill walk patient primary progressive MS severe functional impairment . Six patient primary progressive MS high disability level recruit participate study . Participants exercise use body-weight support treadmill training ( BWSTT ; Woodway Loco-system ) allow portion individual 's body-weight counterbalance overhead pulley system . This system allow patient limited mobility walk upright treadmill therapist assistance . Therapists train use BWSTT system guide patient ' leg proper gait motion assist low limb control . Participants complete 72 training session ( 30min/session , 3x/week ) course 24 week . Participants evaluate baseline , 12 week ( half-way training program ) 24 week ( end intervention ) . A follow-up assessment also perform 12 participant complete train program ( 36 week ) . Outcome measure describe .</detailed_description>
