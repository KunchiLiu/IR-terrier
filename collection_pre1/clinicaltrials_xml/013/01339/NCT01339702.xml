	<brief_title>The EPIC Project : Impact Implementing EMS Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Guidelines</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Significance : Approximately 1.4 million victim Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) see emergency department year U.S. , , 50,000 die 235,000 hospitalize . A least 2 % U.S. population TBI-related long-term need help perform activity daily live . There grow evidence management TBI early minute injury profoundly impact outcome . This led promulgation evidence-based TBI treatment guideline authoritative national international scientific body . Reports guideline implementation hospital set promising . However , study evaluate impact prehospital setting . While randomized prehospital trial identify effectiveness guideline would clearly optimal , strong indirect evidence currently preclude withhold guideline therapy ethical consideration . Thus large , prospective , historically control , observational study best methodology currently available evaluate effectiveness implement guideline prehospital setting . - Specific Aim : To test hypothesis implementation TBI guideline statewide EMS system reduce mortality improve non-mortality outcome adult child moderate severe TBI . - Objective # 1 : Implement nationally-vetted TBI guideline across broad variety EMS system ( urban , suburban rural ) throughout State Arizona . This accomplished statewide collaboration University Arizona , Arizona Department Health Services , local EMS agency respond 85 % state 's population . This mirror approach successfully employ study document triple patient survival out-of-hospital cardiac arrest state . - Objective # 2 : Collect prehospital EMS trauma center data severe TBI patient care participate EMS agency determine pre-implementation post-implementation injury severity/risk-adjustment measure outcome . - Objective # 3 : Evaluate impact prehospital guideline implementation follow outcome : 1 ) Overall mortality ( primary outcome ) , 2 ) mortality among patient intubate prior hospital arrival , 3 ) non-mortality outcome hospital/intensive care unit length stay , ventilator day , patient disposition . - Relevance/health impact : The societal burden TBI immense . While potential dramatically reduce morbidity mortality early treatment appear great , effectiveness prehospital guideline remain unproven . Demonstrating impact guideline therapy would potentially lead widespread implementation effective intervention . This could dramatically reduce morbidity mortality major public health problem . On hand , guideline effective despite confirm implementation across wide variety EMS system throughout entire state , would provide ethical basis conduct future randomize trial .</detailed_description>
