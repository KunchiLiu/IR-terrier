	<brief_summary>Obesity link several serious medical condition , include high blood pressure , diabetes , poor cholesterol level . For reason , obesity likely important single contributor cardiovascular mortality United States . Fortunately , intensive weight management program effective treatment obesity . Such program help people lose weight improve measure cardiac risk . In response grow number obese Veterans treat Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) facility , VHA develop MOVE ! Program . Veterans commit MOVE ! participate actively lose weight . Unfortunately , MOVE ! , like weight management program , require participant attend class exercise , often locations time inconvenient . The investigator propose make easy eligible patient Zablocki Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( ZVAMC ) participate offer MOVE-style class exercise group variety location , day , time . The investigator ' program-MOVE OUT-may provide model VHA use nationwide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MOVE OUT : A Partnership With Veterans Groups Enhance Weight Management Veterans Health Administration ( VHA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Obesity increase prevalence severity cardiovascular risk factor hypertension , diabetes , metabolic syndrome . It also lead contributor cancer osteoarthritis . Obesity overweight highly prevalent among VHA patient : As general population , two-thirds VHA user either overweight obese . There good evidence intensive weight reduction program modest-but clinically significant-impact weight . VHA develop comprehensive weight management program know MOVE ! address obesity among patient . MOVE ! evaluation date demonstrate success help Veterans lose weight , participation low . In investigator ' preliminary work , investigator find timing ( daytime ) location ( ZVAMC ) MOVE ! activity view eligible patient barrier participation . In addition , previous research often demonstrate significant rebound weight end formal program activity , may mitigate convenient place ongoing weight monitor healthy activity peer . Objectives : The overall goal project increase participation ZVAMC MOVE ! program implement innovative community-based program know MOVE OUT . MOVE OUT incorporate key element prove MOVE ! program ( education , peer support , plan physical activity ) , setting closer home eligible Zablocki patient . The investigator follow objective : 1 . To reduce mean weight high-risk overweight obese Veterans receive primary care ZVAMC . 2 . To improve physical activity diet high-risk overweight obese Veterans receive primary care ZVAMC . 3 . To demonstrate innovative community-based program increase proportion ZVAMC user participate actively moderately intensive weight management program recommend National Institutes Health Consensus Conference Obesity . Methods : The investigator use cluster randomize trial design . The investigator allocate group eligible Veterans ZVAMC either MOVE OUT invitation standard MOVE ! invitation . The investigator use clinically gather weight data determine overall rate weight loss randomly assign Veterans . In addition , investigator recruit sample Veterans randomize group participate study effectiveness weight management program assign . The investigator use establish method assess change diet , exercise attitude , well physiologic outcome include weight , blood pressure , Hemoglobin A1c , lipid value . The investigator use qualitative method learn aspect two program effective . Impact : The investigator demonstrate VHA deliver effective weight management service community-based fashion . If study find delivery approach lead increased number at-risk Veterans participate weight control program , guide program design throughout VHA . Although weight management particularly well suit disseminate delivery model , lesson learn research likely help VHA improve ability help patient self-manage variety chronic disease .</detailed_description>
