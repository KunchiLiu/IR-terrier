	<brief_summary>Background : Drugs give treat cancer ( chemotherapy ) weaken human immune system . But also become weaker age . Interleukin ( IL ) -7 , molecule produce naturally body , help improve function immune system . Researchers want study effect IL-7 immune system function two different group old people . One group people receive vaccines IL-7 . The group people receive Vaccines IL-7 . Objectives : To evaluate effect IL-7 immune system responses vaccine old people follow chemotherapy . Eligibility : People least 60 year age recently finish chemotherapy breast , colon , bladder cancer . Design : - People study screened physical examination , medical history , blood test . Other screen test , tumor imaging , may also need perform . - Everyone receive series five different vaccine commonly use prevent disease . We compare response people Sequence 1 receive vaccine IL-7 response people Sequence 2 receive vaccine IL-7 . - The vaccine give randomly two Arms different time . - Arm 1 : diphtheria tetanus , polio , pneumonia ( two booster shot ) , hepatitis B ( two booster shot ) , hepatitis A ( one booster shot ) , - Arm 2 : hepatitis A ( one booster shot ) , hepatitis B ( two booster shot ) , pneumococcal ( two booster shot ) , diphtheria tetanus , polio , pneumonia ( two booster shot ) - There 5 vaccine give subject , follow one two randomly assign sequence vaccine administration ( Sequence 1 Sequence 2 ) . - The first vaccine arm contain two diphtheria protein contain vaccine tetanus diphtheria ( Td ) pneumococcal conjugate 13 ( PCV13 ) polio . The second vaccine arm contain Hepatitis A Hepatitis B vaccine . Subjects either get tetanus , diphtheria , polio , pneumonia vaccine IL-7 therapy ( Sequence 1 ) hepatitis A hepatitis B vaccines IL-7 therapy ( Sequence 2 ) . The response vaccine evaluate 4 week vaccination . This follow IL-7 therapy , administration group vaccine . Therefore , subject arm receive set vaccine , different time respect IL-7 therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Interleukin-7 homeostatic cytokine critical role lymphoid homeostasis exert immune-restorative effect , particularly re-expansion naive memory T cell subset . - The clinical implication kinetics , nature extent immune reconstitution defect follow standard ablative chemotherapy old adult cancer ( particular lack reconstitution large pool naive T cell broad repertoire diversity memory T cell ) fully appreciate . - As chemotherapy often induce temporary complete partial disease response cure , candidate novel immunotherapy strategy may significantly impede response active immunotherapy attempt , therapeutic potential may misjudge altogether overlook . - Recombinant human interleukin-7 ( rhIL-7 ) may play role immune reconstitution immune enhancement various circumstance immune insufficiency old individual follow chemotherapy context enhance cancer immunotherapy immune senescence . OBJECTIVES : - Evaluate quantify impact interleukin-7 ( CYT107 ) therapy specific immune response vaccine ( particular neo antigen ) old subject follow chemotherapy . ELIGIBILITY : - Adults age 60 . - Diagnosis non metastatic breast , bladder colorectal cancer follow adjuvant / neo-adjuvant chemotherapy . - Completed treatment chemotherapy minimum 4 week prior entry . - Reasonable expectation chemotherapy give subsequent 6 month . DESIGN : - Subjects enrol follow specific therapy respective disease . - Subjects undergo immunization various antigen , randomize administer either treatment CYT107 - The vaccine , randomly assign administer CYT107 therapy administer four week start CYT107 therapy . - CYT107 administer week 3 dos ( 20 microg/kg/dose ) via intramuscular route ( IM ) - The vaccine , randomly assign administer CYT107 therapy administer 17 day first dose CYT107 therapy .</detailed_description>
