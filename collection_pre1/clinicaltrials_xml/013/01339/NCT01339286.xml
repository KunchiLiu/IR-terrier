	<brief_summary>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) common behavior disorder , prevalence 3 % 6 % child adolescent . The patient ' academic achievement , profession social living impair . Comorbid antisocial behavior , substance abuse delinquency burden family society . Stimulants use first line drug . But medication compliance poor strict drug administration . Atomoxetine new non-stimulant drug , effectively improve ADHD symptom . But achieve effect slowly , drug response differ significantly , side effect interfere compliance . Since genetic factor important cause different drug response , project study candidate gene potentially associate atomoxetine medication , aim find 2 3 gene polymorphism influence drug response ADHD . The study adopt cohort design . A sample 100 ADHD case atomoxetine medication collect . The rapid genotyping large sample depend high-through laboratory . New statistic method use improve sensitivity target gene detection . There report country overseas . This project provide basic information forecast drug response , improve clinical effect , tolerance long-term compliance .</brief_summary>
