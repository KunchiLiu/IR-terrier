	<detailed_description>To date mechanism intestinal absorption glycerophosphates sphingolipids completely investigate . It assume , sphingolipids sterols compete intestinal absorption . In addition unclear , dietary phospholipid supplementation may influence phospholipid concentration plasma . To evaluate effect dietary phospholipid supplementation 15 healthy female subject receive 10 day daily 3 g milk phospholipid stir dairy product . During follow 10 day subject supplement daily 6 g milk phospholipid . Finally , subject receive 10 day 6 g milk phospholipid dairy product 2 g plant sterols serve commercial product .</detailed_description>
