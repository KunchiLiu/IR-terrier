	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) clinically significant form `` minor depression '' among common mental disorder elderly . Data Epidemiologic Catchment Area Studies indicate community dwell elderly , prevalence MDD approximately 1-2 percent . The prevalence dysthymia `` clinically significant '' depressive symptom estimate 2-3 % 5-10 % respectively . Clinically significant mood disorder responsible considerable medical psychosocial morbidity . These include frequent medical psychiatric hospitalization , visit emergency room , suicide attempt , use alcohol , prescription medication psychotropic effect . The clinical impact disorder comparable cause chronic medical disorder . The vast majority patient mood disorder manage ambulatory care/primary care setting around country . Ambulatory care clinic become `` defacto '' setting diagnosis management psychiatric problem , especially elderly . Depression , particularly elderly , associated several chronic medical illness include malignancy , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , gastrointestinal , vascular , autoimmune demyelinate disorder . Acknowledging overall robust association medical illness mood disorder , NIH consensus statement depression elderly state , `` The hallmark depression late-life association medical comorbidity . '' While precise mechanism coexist medical illness contribute depression remain unclear , neuroanatomical , vascular , immunologic , psychosocial /or combination mechanism invoke possible pathway medical disorder may lead depression elderly . Late-life MDD characterize 1 ) Neuroanatomical change neocortical subcortical region brain . These principally comprise decrease focal brain volume increase volume high intensity lesion parenchyma ; 2 ) The increase high intensity lesion occur largely , though exclusively , white matter ; 3 ) Preliminary study suggest abnormality white matter region tract even area appear normal MR image patient late-life MDD compare control ; 4 ) Biochemical biophysical change white matter likely related pathophysiology major psychiatric disorder independent impact cerebrovascular disease/risk factor . TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Specific Aim 1 : To estimate absolute level ratio ( metabolite/creatine ) NAA , Ch Ml bilaterally dorsolateral white matter subcortical nucleus patient MDD non-depressed control . Hypothesis : Absolute level ratios Ch Ml high level NAA low dorsolateral white matter subcortical nucleus patient MDD compare control . Specific Aim 2 : To estimate magnetization transfer ratio ( MTR ) bilaterally frontal white matter/head caudate nucleus putamen patient MDD control examine relationship MTR MRS measure dorsolateral white matter . Hypothesis : MTR significantly low normal appear dorsolateral white matter region subcortical nucleus ( caudate nucleus putamen ) patient MDD compare control . Hypothesis b : There inverse relationship MTR normalized level Ml patient diagnose MDD dorsolateral white matter bilaterally . Specific Aim 3 : To examine neurocognitive correlate frontal striatal compromise identify use MRS MT ratio measure patient MDD control . The association NAA global cognitive scale MT ratios bilateral dorsolateral white matter subcortical nucleus subscales target dorsolateral striatal cognitive functioning examine . Hypothesis : Among healthy depress elderly , NAA/Cr positively relate global scale cognitive function . Hypothesis b : Among healthy depress elderly , MT ratios dorsolateral cortex positively related subscale dorsolateral function ( work memory , executive function , nonverbal recall ) . Hypothesis c : Among healthy depress elderly , MT ratios subcortical nucleus positively related subscale striatal function ( processing , learn ) . Exploratory analysis : In addition specific aim , investigator conduct two three exploratory analysis . Analysis 1 : A finely grained analysis investigator examine relationship NAA , Ml Cho ratios dorsolateral striatal subscales examine relationship global cognitive function . The investigator also study relationship relative concentration NAA Ml ( NAA/MI ) Ch ( NAA/Ch ) global regional subscales . In addition , preliminary MTR data suggest may laterally effect , investigator examine . Analysis 2 : A comparison blood sample healthy versus depress subject group , see evidence difference neurotransmitter system , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenals ( HAP ) axis , immune function two group elderly person . Analysis 3 : To examine whether neuroimaging cognitive measure associate major depression reverse antidepressant treatment .</detailed_description>
