	<brief_summary>Circadian rhythm disorder class sleep disorder characterize misalignment timing sleep timing rhythm driven biological clock . Light therapy effectively treat disorder , intensity duration light exposure require limited practical use . In study investigator test whether pre-exposure dim light may enhance response circadian system light therapy . If , could result short treatment would great practical application .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sleep disorder affect 35-40 % adult , result diminish quality life , increased morbidity , mortality , risk automobile occupational accident . Circadian rhythm sleep disorder form distinct class sleep disorder characterize misalignment timing sleep circadian pacemaker . While light therapy effective treatment circadian rhythm sleep disorder , numerous practical limitation . Light powerful signal environment influence regulate daily biological rhythm . It well-established irradiance , duration , time light exposure affect response circadian system . While thought response mediate visual system , know network intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cell ( ipRGCs ) mediate circadian response light . Other new study demonstrate recent light exposure history affect circadian response light human . These recent finding important implication use light treat circadian rhythm disorder , include delay advanced sleep phase disorder , shift work sleep disorder , jet lag , may also relevance use light treat seasonal affective disorder . Up , little attention pay duration intensity light exposure prior light treatment . The investigator evidence human circadian system become desensitized light long exposure evidence sensitize light prior exposure dim light . These recent finding suggest light treatment protocol sensitize circadian system prior light treatment effective currently use . The 13-day inpatient study investigator propose examine effect human circadian system different duration dim-light sensitization prior standardized light treatment . These result compare within subject randomize cross-over design study subject receive control treatment light treatment prior dim-light sensitization . The investigator also include circadian phase disorder patient test mechanism target patient population . Our finding provide important step understand new knowledge circadian photoreceptive system use refine provide good treatment option circadian rhythm disorder .</detailed_description>
