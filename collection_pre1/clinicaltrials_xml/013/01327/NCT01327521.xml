This evaluation determine 6 week initial TACE Multispecialty evaluation whereby recurrent liver lesion deem attend radiation oncologist interventional radiologist amenable treatment respective modality Eligible patient must undergo IV contrast CT scan liver within 6 week enrollment onto study ; contrast enhance liver MRI may substitute IV contrast CT liver . A recent serum AFP must also obtain within 4 week enrollment . Unifocal liver tumor exceed 7.5 cm great axial dimension . Multifocal lesion restrict lesion treat within single target volume within liver segment aggregate 7.5cm long dose constraint normal tissue meet Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status 0 , 1 2 Patients liver disease classify Child Pugh class A/B ; Child 's class B , score must 8 less Albumin &gt; = 2.5 g/dL Total bilirubin &lt; = 3 mg/dL INR &lt; = 1.5 Creatinine &lt; = 2.0 mg/dL Age &gt; = 18 year old Life expectancy &gt; = 6 month Ability research subject authorize legal representative understand willingness sign write informed consent document .
