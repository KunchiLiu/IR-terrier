	<brief_title>Z-Endoxifen Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Locally Recurrent Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To determine either maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) Z-endoxifen hydrochloride dose level associate endoxifen steady state concentration ( Css ) least 2 uM woman metastatic estrogen-receptor positive ( ER+ ) breast cancer . ( Dose Escalation Cohort ) II . To describe safety profile Z-endoxifen ( Z-endoxifen hydrochloride ) dose examine . ( Dose Escalation Cohort ) III . To evaluate change vision 2 cycle treatment . ( Dose Escalation Cohort ) IV . To gather preliminary data clinical benefit term tumor response rate progression-free survival . ( Dose Escalation Cohort ) V. To evaluate change frequency severity hot flash 2 cycle treatment . ( Expansion Cohort ) VI . Evaluate change irritability scale use validated irritability questionnaire . ( Expansion Cohort ) VII . To evaluate change marker bone formation absorption 2 cycle treatment . ( Expansion Cohort ) XIII . To evaluate change vision 2 cycle treatment . ( Expansion Cohort ) . IX . To characterize safety profile Z-endoxifen . ( Expansion Cohort ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize plasma pharmacokinetics urinary excretion Z-endoxifen dos examine . II . For patient begin dose level 7 well expansion cohort , describe change tumor expression ER ( full length truncate form ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) , steroid receptor co-activator ( SRC ) 1 , SRC3 , well insulin-like growth factor receptor ( IGF ) 1R/phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) /v-akt Murine Thymoma Viral Oncogene Homolog 1 ( AKT ) /mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway proliferation-related Ki-67 antigen ( Ki67 ) 1 cycle treatment ( approximately 28 day ) . III . To determine frequency estrogen receptor 1 ( ESR1 ) mutation presence antitumor activity ( response rate progression free survival [ PFS ] ) patient whose tumor harbor ESR1 alteration . IV . To determine whether ESR1 mutation identify pre-treatment tumor biopsy detect matched plasma cell free deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study follow expansion cohort study . Patients receive Z-endoxifen hydrochloride orally ( PO ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 3 month .</detailed_description>
