	<brief_summary>The current study explore incretin effect ; central mechanism sugar metabolism . People type 2 diabetes markedly reduce incretin effect , incretin effect never study patient severe chronic renal failure . Non-diabetic patient severe kidney failure patient diabetes normal kidney function share several pathophysiological trait , include decreased sensitivity insulin , fast hyperinsulinaemia impair beta cell function . The investigator expect incretin effect affect patient chronic renal failure without diabetes , time result therapeutic change group patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The novel original aspect investigator initiate study focus incretin ( patho ) physiology uraemic milieu . In first 5 substudies ( separate notification registration ) investigator explore incretin effect . Our hypothesis impair non-diabetic patient chronic dialysis treatment . The prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) rapidly increase worldwide . In addition reduce insulin sensitivity beta cell dysfunction , T2DM characterize severely impaired incretin effect . The incretin effect refers insulinotropic action nutrient-released incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) . Both hormone secrete intestinal endocrine mucosal cell . The incretin effect define difference insulin secretory responses oral isoglycaemic intravenous ( iv ) glucose challenge . In healthy individual account much 70 % insulin secrete response oral glucose , whereas patient T2DM exhibit incretin effect range 0 30 % . The incretin hormone GLP-1 potent blood glucose-lowering effect patient T2DM . However , follow secretion GLP-1 , ubiquitous enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) rapidly cleave hormone , completely inactivate . This formed basis new pharmacological agent block DPP-4 ( DPP-4 inhibitor ) DPP-4 resistant GLP-1 receptor agonist . Long-term treatment show positive effect glycaemic control risk factor cardiovascular disease patient T2DM . These effect may applicable also patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient T2DM normal kidney function non-diabetic patient ESRD show several identical characteristic . These include decreased insulin sensitivity , hyperinsulinaemia impair beta cell function . The incretin effect small extent investigated patient ESRD . The single frequent cause ESRD need chronic maintenance dialysis diabetic nephropathy . In U.S. 50 % patient dialysis diabetes compare 23 % Denmark . The life expectancy dialysis patient T2DM severely reduce median survival 2 4 year treatment document significantly improve poor prognosis . The common cause death group patient related cardiovascular disease seem result death cause different classical atherosclerosis . So far intervention direct towards hypertension , dyslipidaemia classical risk factor show divergent primarily negative result . There therefore unmet medical need find new treatment protect patient cardiovascular disease premature death . Improving glycaemic control use incretin-based therapy potential meet medical need . The incretin hormone metabolites however large extent excrete kidney may lead problem ( benefit ! ) administer patient without kidney function severely reduce kidney function . The present knowledge incretin effect incretin hormone physiology well pharmacokinetics , clinical effect side effect GLP-1 analogue patient reduce kidney function limit study available predominantly confine patient mild moderately reduce kidney function . The investigator explorer basic pharmacologic aspect patient severe reduce kidney function depend chronic maintenance dialysis treatment . Before potential treatment initiate , investigator need basic information incretin system affect uraemic milieu . Current succeed substudies provide u information .</detailed_description>
