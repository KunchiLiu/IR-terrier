	<brief_title>Early Thienopyridine Treatment Improve Primary PCI Patients With Acute MI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This could achieve either thrombolytic therapy primary Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Comparison different therapy randomize trial show advantage primary PCI regard rate recanalisation infarct vessel , preservation leave ventricular ( LV ) function , reduction rate reinfarctions . In addition , in-hospital mortality lower patient undergo primary PCI . Nevertheless , primary PCI always result successful reperfusion despite successful restoration blood flow epicardial infarct relate artery . Effective platelet inhibition cornerstone therapy patient STEMI . In ISIS-2 study acetylsalicylic acid ( ASA ) show improve short- long-term clinical outcome extent fibrinolysis streptokinase . Dual platelet inhibition ASA thienopyridine repeatedly demonstrate effective ASA alone . Clopidogrel top ASA improve outcome patient acute coronary syndrome without PCI CURE study . Furthermore , load dose 300 mg clopidogrel advantageous elective PCI CREDO trial addition clopidogrel ASA improve patency rate infarct relate artery patient STEMI undergoing fibrinolysis . In BRAVE 3 study , addition abciximab background therapy high load dose 600 mg clopidogrel plus ASA result additional clinical benefit term prevention ischemic complication primary elective PCI , suggest near optimal platelet inhibition treatment primary PCI . The advantage 600 mg load dose seem mainly relate rapid onset full antiplatelet effect within 2-4 hour compare 6-8 hour 300 mg . However , patient STEMI schedule primary PCI earlier effective inhibition ADP-induced platelet aggregation , preferably within 60-90 min administration drug , need . The new thienopyridine prasugrel show achieve complete even rapid platelet inhibition compare clopidogrel . This might especially important patient STEMI schedule primary PCI . In patient activation platelet pronounce compare patient undergo PCI stable CAD . In small substudy TRITON-TIMI 38 trial inhibition platelet aggregation measure VASP assay effective prasugrel clopidogrel . However , substudy do predominantly patient unstable angina NSTEMI . In addition , none patient treat pre-hospital phase . Therefore necessary determine patient acute STEMI early administration high load dose prasugrel comparison clopidogrel plan primary PCI improve inhibition platelet aggregation , therefore facilitate procedure result improve myocardial reperfusion PCI .</detailed_description>
