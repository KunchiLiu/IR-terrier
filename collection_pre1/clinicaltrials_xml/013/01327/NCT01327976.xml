	<brief_summary>The study evaluate safety efficacy vBloc Therapy deliver Maestro Rechargeable System compare sham control treatment obesity . The Maestro Rechargeable System deliver intermittent , electrical blocking signal anterior posterior trunk intra-abdominal vagus nerve ( termed vBloc Therapy ) design reduce sensation hunger produce satiety lead weight loss . After approval institutional review board , subject provide write consent randomize 2 1 allocation vBloc group ( laparoscopic placement lead neuroregulator ) sham group ( placement custom sham neuroregulator ) double-blinded basis . Both group receive similar diet exercise counseling . Weight , adverse event , clinical laboratory , ECGs , eat questionnaire quality life data evaluate throughout 12 month study duration .</brief_summary>
