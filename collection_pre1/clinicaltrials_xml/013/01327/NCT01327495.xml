	<detailed_description>The investigator overall goal ( ) determine relationship serum prostate tissue hormone concentration men response increase dos exogenous androgen ; ( ii ) determine impact alteration serum tissue testosterone concentration prostate epithelial cell function phenotype ; ( iii ) determine relationship prostatic androgen alteration tissue microenvironment . The investigator perform study healthy , middle-aged men address follow Specific Aims : Specific Aims : To compare dose-response relationship serum testosterone intraprostatic androgen androgen action , serum testosterone anabolic activity healthy , middle-aged men . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize low level serum testosterone low concentration intraprostatic testosterone dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) . However , serum testosterone concentration within even normal range significant increase intraprostatic testosterone dihydrotestosterone . In contrast , investigator expect anabolic activity increase increase concentration circulate testosterone . Secondarily , investigator hypothesize increase level serum testosterone beyond low normal range little impact androgen action within prostate . Approach : The investigator conduct randomize , placebo-controlled trial healthy men medically castrate administered one five different dos testosterone gel ( Androgel ) 12 week .</detailed_description>
