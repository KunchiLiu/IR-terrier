	<detailed_description>No single strategy prevention HIV emerge consistently use successful , multiple strategy develop . PrEP involve deliver ARV medication people expose HIV , order prevent infection . The optimal method deliver PrEP yet determine . This study examine feasibility deliver PrEP three method . Daily dose involves receive ARV medication every day ; time-driven dosing involve receive ARV medication twice weekly plus post-exposure dose ; event-driven dosing involve receive ARV medication potential exposure HIV . The ARV medication use study combination pill contain emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( FTC/TDF ) . Recent research study show , take consistently , daily oral dose FTC/TDF reduce risk HIV infection . This study enroll HIV-uninfected men sex men transgender woman ( MSM/TGW ) woman sex men ( WSM ) . Participation last 34 week . All participant give combination pill contain FTC/TDF . For first 5 week , participant come study clinic weekly receive single dose FTC/TDF . At Week 6 , participant randomly assign one three group . In daily dose group , participant take FTC/TDF day . In time-dosing group , participant take FTC/TDF twice per week another dose sexual intercourse ( post-exposure dose ) . In event-dosing group , participant take FTC/TDF sexual intercourse . During part study , participant give FTC/TDF take . Every week , Week 6 Week 29 , study official call ask question many pill participant take sexual intercourse . Participants also complete computer-assisted self-interviews ( CASIs ) . Study visit occur enrollment , week first 5 week , month Week 34 .
