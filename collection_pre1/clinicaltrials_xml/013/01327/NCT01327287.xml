	<brief_title>Early Aggressive Pain Management Associated With Improved Outcomes Blunt Thoracic Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due limit availability patient population study require together inclusion exclusion criterion study demand , study employ retrospective chart review process well prospective enrollment qualify patient provide consent participate . The two main group evaluate : ( 1 ) eligible patient receive thoracic epidural within 48 hour injury ( 2 ) eligible patient receive thoracic epidural within 48 hour injury . In retrospective prospective approach , investigator identify patient blunt thoracic trauma eligible thoracic epidural placement receive treatment well patient eligible receive . Hospital data ventilator day , ICU day , hospital day , hospital charge , complication , etc . record . A retrospective chart review patient admit SFGH suffer blunt thoracic injury result 3 rib fracture 5year time period January 1 , 2004 January 1 , 2009 conduct . Patient chart review pain management use blunt thoracic trauma , hospital course , vitals , lab , outcome measure . Similar prospective enrollment process , retrospective chart review screen patient meet inclusion criterion meet exclusion criterion . Prospective patient admit SFGH suffer blunt thoracic injury ( rib fracture , sternal fracture ) require IV opioids pain relief fit exclusion criterion enrol . Patients ask give informed sign consent study doctor place thoracic epidural within 48 hour injury continue maximum 5 day . The consent process twofold . For consented receive thoracic epidural agree health information ( HIPAA form ) use study additional permission require . However , patient wish receive epidural , consent still seek health information use analyze arm study receive thoracic epidural . Patient data vitals , labs outcome measure record analyze . The data gather retrospective prospective analysis use assess utilization rate thoracic epidural , determine use thoracic epidural associate low resource utilization cost effective . In retrospective chart review prospective enrollment process , subjective pain , improve pulmonary function , amount analgesia overall clinical outcome measure determine patient receive epidural catheter significantly improve clinical outcome patient receive epidural catheter .</detailed_description>
