	<brief_summary>Background : The transradial approach increasingly use percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) low major access site complication , low bleeding risk earlier patient mobilization . According trend , last couple year University Hospital Geneva investigator change practice currently transradial approach frequently use PCI . However , small diameter radial artery remain major limitation technique , especially woman complex PCI necessitating large bore guide catheter . This may overcome sheathless guide catheter ( Asahi , Japan ) , allow standard inner catheter diameter ( 6-7 Fr ) , outer diameter equivalent standard 5 6 Fr introducer sheath . Aim : This study aim compare transradial approach PCI sheathless guide catheter standard guide catheter woman patient complex lesion necessitate large bore guide catheter . Material method : This prospective study consecutively randomize woman men bifurcation/ostial lesion major coronary vessel ( i.e . ≈ 120/year ) transradial PCI attempt . The procedure perform either standard 6 7Fr guiding catheter sheathless 6.5 , 7.5 Fr catheter . End-points : Successful performance transradial PCI consecutive patient qualify accord inclusion criterion ( technical feasibility ) . Establish proportion procedure perform device-related complication ( safety ) . Analyze detail technical aspect sheathless catheter ( efficacy ) . Sample size : The investigator plan include study ≈ 250 patient two year . After 1 year enrollment investigator perform interim analysis instigator decide moment , accord observe end-points , prolong study would scientific value . In case another 100 patient include study . Enrollment time : The investigator start study soon local ethical committee give u permission . The investigator plan start study July 2010 . The end expect July 2012 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Patients need least 18 year old . Patients present significant coronary artery disease qualify PCI treated radial approach . Any woman require PCI treat radial approach . Any patient bifurcation lesion ostial lesion leave anterior descending ( LAD ) and/or leave circumflex artery ( LCX ) , lesion commonly treat 7 Fr guide catheter . Bifurcation lesion = lesion main epicardial vessel ( i.e . LAD , LCX , right coronary artery ) involve least one major side branch ( i.e . diagonal marginal branch ) . Ostial lesion LAD LCX = presence significant stenosis &lt; 5mm distal part leave main . Patients refuse give write informed consent . Male patient , PCI easily perform 6 Fr standard guide catheter ( i.e . bifurcation ostial lesion ) . Patients radial approach contraindicate : Patients dialysis arteriavenous fistula arteriavenous fistula plan future . Patients know radial artery occlusion . Patients radial approach unsuccessfully already attempt past ( anamnestic notion previous medical record ) secondary : Challenging vessel anatomy , Vessel tortuosity , Known impossibility cannulate coronary ostia radial approach . Patients Allen test result pathological bilaterally : In case pathological Allen test one hand hand test choose femoral approach . Patients femoral approach adopt primary catheterization approach ( interventionist 's discretion ) , include : Unstable patient ( myocardial infarction , cardiogenic shock ) . Patients necessitate femoral access intraaortic balloon counterpulsation Patients present double mammary coronary graft ( right leave internal mammary utilized bypass graft ) . Coronary intervention extreme good guide support mandatory ( i.e . PCI chronic total occlusion , PCI Rotablator ) . Particularly risky PCI ( e.g. , PCI leave main artery ) , femoral approach may comfortable operator . Patients require femoral approach right heart catheterization .</criteria>
