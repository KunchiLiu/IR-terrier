	<detailed_description>Diabetes major health problem affect approximately 18 million Americans . It grow crisis devastate complication include heart disease , peripheral neuropathy renal failure . According literature review Gavard et al , prevalence major depression sample diabetic population control study 8.5 27.3 % ( mean prevalence 14.0 % ) . This estimate three time prevalence major depression general U.S. adult population . Diabetes major depression mutual risk factor , diabetic patient likely develop major depression odds ratio 2.5 depressed patient likely develop type 2 diabetes estimate relative risk 2.2 . Depression also significant impact course diabetes , lead high rate hyperglycemia diabetic complication . Depression patient diabetes also associate poor compliance , decrease quality life , increase disability great health care utilization . A recent 8-year follow-up study patient diabetes depression conclude coexistence illness associate significantly increase risk death cause beyond due either depression diabetes alone . In study , patient diabetes depression 1.3-fold increase risk death cause compare patient diabetes alone 2-fold increase risk death compare patient depression . Reports prospective , community-based study western Australia suggest behavioral consequence depression , include non-compliance medication exercise regimen , contribute increase mortality patient . TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Specific Aim 1 : To study biophysical property white gray matter critical cortical subcortical region use magnetization transfer patient type 2 diabetes MDD , non-depressed diabetic control , patient unipolar depression without diabetes nondiabetic healthy control . The investigator interested separate cumulative effect diabetes depression Magnetization Transfer Ratios ( MTR ) different brain region . Hypothesis : The overarch hypothesis diabetes depression effect lower magnetization transfer ratio ( MTR ) anterior cingulate cortex , subcortical nucleus ( head caudate nucleus putamen ) frontal white matter . These effect cumulative may additive region . Our pilot data suggest MTR low region patient type 2 diabetes ( without depression ) compare healthy control . In region ( eg . head caudate nucleus - see preliminary data ) investigator anticipate patient diabetes MDD low healthy control high MT ratio . The group unipolar depression without diabetes diabetic control MT ratios fall two group . In region interest , group diabetes value significantly different healthy control , patient diagnose unipolar depression fall healthy diabetic group . Specific Aim 2 : To examine level glutamate aspartate ( creatine ratio ) two region involve regulation mood cognition - bilateral anterior cingulate cortex leave subcortical region ( head caudate nucleus putamen ) patient type 2 diabetes three comparison group . Hypothesis : Levels glutamate aspartate ( creatine ratio ) low patient combine Type 2 Diabetes MDD compare non-depressed diabetic patient healthy control . Our pilot data provide little basis expect simple effect diabetes alone rule interaction effect see , worsen , combination diabetes depression . The inclusion depress non-diabetic group current design make possible evaluate whether observed effect doubly-diagnosed group best view effect depression alone interaction diabetes plays role . Specific Aim 3 : To examine relationship regional MTRs specific cognitive domain subject four group . Hypothesis : There direct correlation study group MT ratio subcortical nucleus , anterior cingulate cortex dorsolateral white matter performance specific cognitive domain , include attention , executive function , learn memory psychomotor processing . Exploratory Aim 1 : In exploratory manner investigator estimate cerebral blood volume , measure cerebral microvasculature , critical brain region involve frontal-subcortical circuitry ( anterior cingulate , dorsolateral white , head caudate nucleus putamen ) subject depress diabetic group three comparison group use dynamic susceptibility contrast MR imaging ( perfusion-weighted MR imaging ) . Exploratory Aim 2 : A comparison blood sample healthy control , diabetic subject , depressed subject subject depression diabetes see evidence difference plasma neurotransmitter level , hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenals ( HPA ) axis , immune function four subject group</detailed_description>
