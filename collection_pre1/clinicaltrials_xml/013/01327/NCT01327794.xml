	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying sample blood patient cancer laboratory may help doctor identify learn biomarkers related cancer . It may also help doctor predict well patient respond treatment . PURPOSE : This research trial study relationship vitamin D biomarkers survival blood sample patient advance pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Relationship Between Vitamin D Biomarkers Survival Blood Samples From Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective - To measure baseline serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 [ OH ] D ) level cohort patient advanced pancreatic cancer enrol Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) study 80303 evaluate association vitamin D status overall survival ( OS ) progression free survival ( PFS ) . Secondary Objective - To evaluate association common germ-line single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) vitamin D pathway gene 25 ( OH ) D level patient advance pancreatic cancer . - To evaluate interaction serum 25 ( OH ) D level germ-line SNPs vitamin D pathway gene predict OS advance pancreatic cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Archived serum sample analyze 25-hydroxyvitamin D level competitive chemiluminescence immunoassay . Results compare germ-line single nucleotide polymorphism Genome-Wide Association Study ( GWAS ) patient ' clinical data .</detailed_description>
