	<brief_title>A Post Marketing Study Apligraf Non-healing Wounds Subjects With Venous Leg Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects ≥5 cm2 , non-infected target ulcer reduce area ≥ 40 % since Screening visit randomize Day 0 either Apligraf Control . After enrollment 25 subject , randomization discontinue remain subject receive Apligraf . Once target ulcer assess Investigator heal study visit , subject 's participation study complete ( eg , assess heal Week 3 , subject would require complete subsequent study visit ) . Apligraf Group ( Day 0 Week 4 ) Prior application , Apligraf fenestrated ( perforate ) standardize manner use # 11 blade 6 fenestration per 44 cm2 . For subject randomize Apligraf group , Apligraf application , dress regimen include foam dressing ( eg . Mepilex ) 4 layered compression bandage system ( eg . Profore ) change weekly Investigator . After initial Apligraf application study Day 0 , Apligraf may apply weekly thereafter additional 4 week study Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , , upon visual inspection , adherent Apligraf wound coverage &lt; 100 % . At Week 4 , area target ulcer compare area target ulcer Day 0 determine target ulcer PTH NPTH . Apligraf subject achieve CWC Week 5 enter Follow-Up Phase time . Control Group ( Day 0 Week 4 [ PTH ] Day 0 Week 8 [ NPTH ] Beginning Day 0 , subject randomize Control group receive standard dress regimen include foam dressing ( e.g . Mepilex® ) four layered compression bandage system ( e.g . Profore™ ) change weekly Investigator . At study Week 4 , size ulcer compare size study Day 0 determine ulcer demonstrate `` Predicted Heal '' ( PTH ) , define &gt; 40 % reduction ulcer surface area compare study Day 0 , `` Not Predicted Heal ( NPTH ) , define &lt; 40 % reduction ulcer surface area compare study Day 0 . Control PTH subject achieve CWC Week 4 continue receive Control treatment enter Follow-Up Phase Week 5 . Control NPTH subject receive Apligraf begin Week 4 . Prior application , Apligraf fenestrated ( perforate ) standardize manner use # 11 blade 6 fenestration per 44 cm2 . After initial Apligraf application Week 4 , Apligraf may apply weekly thereafter additional 4 week study Weeks 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 upon visual inspection , adherent Apligraf wound coverage &lt; 100 % . After Apligraf application , standard dress regimen apply target ulcer . The dress change weekly Investigator . At Week 8 , area target ulcer compare area target ulcer Week 4 determine target ulcer PTH NPTH . Control NPTH subject achieve CWC Week 9 enter Follow-up Phase time .</detailed_description>

Subject must read , understood sign institutional review board ( IRB ) approve Informed Consent Form . 4 . Subject must able willing follow study procedure instruction . 1 . Subjects require VAC® ( Vacuum Assisted Closure™ ) therapy Day 0 Study visit . 2 . Subject arterial disease determine Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) measurement &lt; 0.65 . 3 . Subject systemic congenital condition like uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , positive HIV test , disorder ( ) may compromise wound healing . 4 . Subjects carcinomas locate target ulcer biopsy confirm active malignancy . ( Subjects carcinoma location would exclude entry study . ) 5 . Subjects currently receive , receive time within 30 day prior Screening visit , noninhaled corticosteroid except topical steroid target ulcer ( Inhaled steroid therapy acceptable study . ) , immunosuppressive agent , radiation therapy , hemodialysis , peritoneal dialysis chemotherapy . ( Anticipated use agent therapy would exclude subject entry study . ) 6 . Clinical vasculitis , severe rheumatoid arthritis , collagen vascular disease . 7 . Signs symptom cellulitis osteomyelitis target ulcer . 8 . Avascular target ulcer bed . ( Ulcers mix etiology arterial disease VLU exclude . ) 9 . Target ulcer expose bone , tendon fascia . 10 . Known hypersensitivity bovine collagen component Apligraf agarose ship medium . 11 . Subject enrol wound investigational study ( drug , biologic device ) disease within 30 day Screening visit . 12 . Subject previously treat Apligraf , Dermagraft® cell therapy target ulcer site within 30 day Screening visit . 13 . Subject history alcohol substance abuse within previous year , could interfere study compliance inability attend schedule study visit . 14 . Subject current smoker cease smoke 6 month prior Screening visit , opinion Investigator , smoke history may compromise wound healing . 15 . Subject , opinion Investigator , reason list , able complete study per protocol . 16 . Target ulcer decrease size &gt; 40 % Screening Day 0 . 17 . Confirmed gene expression overlap subject 's cell ( buccal swab ) cell contain Apligraf .</criteria>
