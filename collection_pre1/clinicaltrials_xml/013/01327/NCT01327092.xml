	<brief_summary>One aim study test efficacy installation multiple , passive measure reduce exposure injury hazard home young child first-time mother reduce childhood injury . The study also seek identify sub-groups mother child benefit intervention examine potential moderating effect maternal depressive symptom , intensity supervisory behavior , child temperament activity , intervention subsequent injury outcome . Specific Aim 1 Hypotheses : H1.1 : The housing unit randomly assign intervention group significant decrease number density ( number per area ) residential injury-related hazard compare control group unit . H1.2 : Children randomize intervention group ( e.g . installation multiple , passive measure reduce exposure residential injury hazard ) 50 % reduction modifiable medically-attended injury compare child control group followed-up 24-months intention-to-treat analysis . Specific Aim 2 : Hypotheses H2.1 : Persistent maternal depressive symptom moderate effect intervention childhood injury home ; household child mother high level symptom hazard injury . H2.2 : Children mother less intense maternal supervisory behavior course intervention follow-up high rate injury . H2.3 : Children score high activity Carey Temperament Scale experience reduce benefit intervention childhood injury home .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Injury remain leading cause morbidity mortality U.S. child first year life home lead location injury young U.S. child . Residential injury result 1.7 million emergency visit child young 5 year age annually U.S. result $ 3 billion medical care cost $ 800 per emergency visit . Therefore , intervention effect sizable reduction childhood injury home could result substantial reduction pain suffer save potentially hundred million dollar healthcare cost . Previous trial fail achieve comprehensive durable installation home safety product reduce exposure injury hazard indoor environment young child . Children mother eligible enrol home visitation program child mother elevate depressive symptom show risk injury home . Inadequate maternal supervisory behavior also show increase risk home injury . This project test efficacy intervention reduce exposure injury hazard home subsequent preventable medically attend injury young child first-time , impoverished mother . This randomize control trial test efficacy public health intervention reduce exposure injury hazard proper installation safety device home subsequent preventable medically attend injury Every Child Succeeds ( ECS ) population . Participants randomize either receive injury prevention measure part literacy effort provide developmentally appropriate book read material mother child , encourage mother gain interest reading child . Mothers participate Every Child Succeeds ( ECS ) home visitation program , complete least one ECS home visit , child le 5 month age enrol study . Index child follow 24 month randomization intervention age approximately 36 month . Measures maternal child psychology , child behavior temperament obtain home visit . Maternal supervision childhood injury assess repeatedly quarterly phone questionnaire home visit . Experimental Group : In home child randomize intervention arm trial , comprehensive observational survey living space undertaken . The study examine living space child may expose include 5 high-exposure , high-risk area ( main activity room , kitchen , child 's bedroom bathroom , stairway ) . In addition quantifying hazard , area room obtain allow determination number density injury hazard . The hazard identify intervention team review parent propose intervention present . Intervention option design prioritized passive durable intervention recommend first progressively less 'passive ' less durable option last . After consent obtain , passive measure instal across live space indicate . One goal study determine whether installed product modify exposure injury hazard reduce unintentional injury across lead mechanism young child time . Another goal determine require maintenance instal product time . At routine home visit request participant prior 18-month follow-up time point , installed intervention assess presence function broken malfunction product repair replace within study budget . Additionally , study budget allow , investigator repeat injury hazard survey perform installation intervention family relocate prior child 24-months age , within 3 hour drive radius CCHMC , move three time . Control Group : Mothers child randomly assign control condition also benefit participation trial . Similar intervention arm , undergo home survey annual visit assessment injury hazard . In addition , family control group receive program seek promote literacy provide developmentally appropriate book , material possibly library card child encourage mother develop interest reading child . After enrollment randomization , CHIP staff visit control group home , ass mother 's interest barrier read child , council mother importance literacy reading book child .</detailed_description>
