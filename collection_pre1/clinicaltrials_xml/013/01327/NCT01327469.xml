	<brief_summary>The major soil-transmitted helminth ( STHs ) , Ascaris lumbricoides ( roundworm ) , Trichuris trichiura ( whipworm ) Necator americanus/Ancylostoma duodenal ( hookworm ) amongst prevalent parasite worldwide . An estimated 4.5 billion individual risk STH one billion individual think infect , 450 million significant morbidity attributable infection , school-aged child particular . In population infection cause stunt linear growth , anemia , reduce cognitive function contribute exist malnutrition . In Jimma ( Ethiopia ) , STH highly prevalent , affect 60 % child ( data publish ) . Current effort control STH infection involve periodic mass drug anthelmintic treatment infected child endemic area likely intensify attention address importance neglect disease . Monitoring drug efficacy control program become indispensable order detect emergence resistance and/or identify confound factor affect drug efficacy . Recently study evaluated single dose albendazole ( ALB ) school age child across 7 country , include Ethiopia , reveal regime highly efficacious treatment A. lumbricoides ( 99.5 % ) hookworm ( 94.8 % ) , T. trichiura ( 50.8 % ) . For parasite repeat dose regime ALB consecutive day likely appropriate . Alternative drug mebendazole ( single dose 500mg ) pyrantel+oxantel ( single dose 10mg/kg ) , latter hold promise also administrate child 6 month 2 year . The main objective present study , therefore , assess efficacy 5 different treatment regime T. trichiura schoolchildren Jimma , Ethiopia , include albendazole ( 1 x 400mg , 2 x 400mg ) , mebendazole ( 1 x 500mg , 2x 500mg ) pyrantel-oxantel ( 10mg/kg ) +mebendazole ( 500mg ) .</brief_summary>
