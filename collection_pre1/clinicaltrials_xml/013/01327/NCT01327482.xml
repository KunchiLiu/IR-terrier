	<brief_summary>This study investigation pharmacokinetics raltegravir tissue female genital tract determine twice-daily dose 400mg achieves adequate drug level prevent viral integration HIV-1 . The study also assess whether drug level change tissue across different phase menstrual cycle . - Hypothesis # 1 : Twice daily dose raltegravir 400mg result intracellular concentration sufficient suppress HIV-1 replication throughout menstrual cycle . - Hypothesis # 2 : Intracellular genital raltegravir peak low trough high compare extracellular concentration plasma PMBCs ( peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) . - Hypothesis # 3 : Intracellular raltegravir concentration slightly low luteal phase menstrual cycle due cellular pump p-glycoprotein , present high number period high progesterone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV-1 shed genital secretion increase risk transmission sexual partner mother infant . Antiretroviral medication take prior exposure HIV-1 prevent viral transmission mother infant . Raltegravir ( RAL ) , block integration viral cDNA host 's genome , make excellent candidate prevent HIV-1 infection . RAL license treatment twice-daily dose base plasma trough concentration ; however , intracellular concentration RAL relevant block infection cell previously study . P-glycoprotein pump , involve regulate drug absorption metabolism , influence intracellular drug concentration . P-glycoprotein concentration appear vary menstrual cycle suggesting may affect intracellular drug concentration RAL woman . Women enrol study follow course menstrual cycle take dose 400mg PO twice daily . An initial screening visit perform prior enrollment participation study . Review medical history well blood urine collection occur screen visit . Once enrol , participant blood genital tract sample collect week four week assess intracellular concentration RAL blood genital tract tissue .</detailed_description>
