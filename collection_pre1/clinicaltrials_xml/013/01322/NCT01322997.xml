	<brief_summary>Stroke lead cause disability United States . One reason disable upper extremity hemiparesis ( weakness one arm ) , commonly see stroke . The objective research see robotic system worn weaken arm like brace useful improve strength coordination affect arm , stroke survivor , therapy . Muscle weakness lack coordination stroke great effect severely disabled arm quality life stroke . In study , patient may administer new robotic brace part treatment affect arm . If use brace , electromyography ( EMG ) signal use control powered arm brace . EMG signal small electrical signal result action muscle . The system `` listen '' patient ' muscle , use small sensor sit top skin . The device give arm `` power-assist '' patient bend straighten elbow . The investigator want test easy effective system use . The investigator hypothesize people use robot successful rehabilitative effort - movement improve - people receive traditional therapy .</brief_summary>
