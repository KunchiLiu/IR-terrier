	<brief_summary>This study compare efficacy behavioral parent training program ( PT ) aim specifically common sleep disturbance compare parent education ( PE ) program focus general issue relate autism . In sample 40 well characterize young child meet criterion autism spectrum disorder ( 24-72 month ) , investigator test whether five session PT program superior PE program decrease sleep disturbance . The primary aim study evaluate efficacy feasibility PT program sleep disturbance young child autism compare PE . To end , two hypothesis : - Hypothesis 1 : After end treatment , PT significantly effective PE improve parent report ) bedtime struggle resistance ; b ) sleep latency ; c ) night waking ; ) morning waking ; / e ) sleep association problem measure composite sleep index score modified Simonds Parraga Sleep Questionnaire ( MSPSQ ; Simond &amp; Parraga , 1982 ; Wiggs &amp; Stores , 1998 ) . - Hypothesis 2 : At end treatment , child PT group ( n=20 ) display significantly improve total sleep period measure actigraphy comparison child PE group ( n=20 ) . The secondary aim study evaluate impact participate PT child 's daytime behavior function parent stress compare PE . To measure aim , 4 exploratory hypothesis : - Exploratory Hypothesis 1 : Lower Irritability subscales score report parent teacher / therapist complete Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) PT group PE group 4 week 8 week - Exploratory Hypothesis 2 : Lower Child Behavior Checklist ( CBCL ; parent complete ) Caregiver-Teacher Report Form ( C-TRF ; teacher complete ) score report PT group PE group 4 week 8 week . - Exploratory Hypothesis 3 : The PT group high score Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales : 2nd Edition ( VABS-II ) 4 week 8 week compare PE group . - Exploratory Hypothesis 4 : Parents receive PT report significantly low score Parenting Stress Index ( PSI ) 4 week 8 week compare parent receive PE .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autism Spectrum Disorders ( Autistic Disorder , Pervasive Developmental Disorder , Asperger Disorder ) severe developmental disorder early childhood onset affect many 1 150 child ( Center Disease Control &amp; Prevention , 2007 ) . They characterize deficit social interaction communication , well repetitive behavior restrict interest ( American Psychiatric Association , 2000 ) . Given severity prevalence , autism significant public health issue . Recent year see increase prevalence autism improve ability diagnose disorder much earlier ( Fombonne , 2003 ) . It child 's early year generally agree intensive intervention likely improve long term prognosis ( National Research Council , 2001 ) . While core feature autism , widely accept large percentage child autism spectrum disorder ( autism ) present significant sleep issue ( Honomichl , Goodlin-Jones , Burnham , Gaylor &amp; Anders , 2002 ; Johnson , 1996 ; Wiggs &amp; Stores , 2004 ) . Sleep problem typically develop child know adversely impact daytime functioning , learn acquisition , well parent family functioning ( Dahl , 1996 ; Ebert &amp; Drake , 2004 ; Sadeh , Gruber , &amp; Raviv ; 2002 ; Sadeh , Raviv , &amp; Gruber , 2000 ) . For young child autism whose development already compromise range deficit , detrimental impact sleep disturbance may even significant . However , impact sleep disturbance optimal performance behavioral education intervention systematically explore . This study conduct randomize clinical trial evaluate efficacy behavioral parent train program amelioration sleep disturbance young child autism . This work use examine feasibility , acceptability efficacy behavior train program sleep disturbance child autism . It represent low cost rapid clinical approach problem young age group .</detailed_description>
