	<brief_summary>This study originally undertaken evaluate analgesic efficacy intravenously administer dose ketorolac compare intravenous morphine relief acute , postoperative pain child admit Intensive Care Unit . Using urine plasma sample originally collect patient morphine treatment group never analyze , proposal seek study pharmacokinetics metabolism intravenous morphine critically-ill child along concentration-related efficacy use prior measure pain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , parallel , single-dose study . All child admit ICU Children 's Hospital Michigan postoperatively require pain management candidate . Enrollment require Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario Pain Scale ( CHEOPS ) and/or Oucher pain score meeting protocol definition moderate severe pain . Each patient randomly assign receive single dose either morphine 0.1 mg/kg ketorolac 0.6 mg/kg IV first postoperative analgesic arrive ICU . Two-milliliter venous blood sample draw site contralateral infusion site . Samples obtain dose 15 , 30 , 60 minute , hourly 1-6 hour , 8 12 hour time begin infusion . Pain scale assess time pharmacokinetic sample . Plasma immediately separate frozen -80°C . Urine quantitatively collect 12-24 hour study drug administer . Urine keep ice 3°C throughout collection . At completion collection , urine volume measure record , aliquot frozen maintain -80°C . The plasma urine sample morphine treat group original study store -80°C analyze . Sets sample urine plasma 6 subject range age analyze insure sample deteriorate storage . This subanalysis study provide chemical analysis plasma urine sample morphine , morphine 3 glucuronide ( M3G ) morphine 6 glucuronide ( M6G ) ; pharmacokinetic analysis morphine metabolites comparison demographic ; comparison morphine concentration measure analgesia . The ratio area plasma concentration v time curve ( AUC ) M6G twice analgesic potency morphine M3G theoretical anti-analgesic property compare analgesic effect measure age-appropriate pain scale .</detailed_description>
