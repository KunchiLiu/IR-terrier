	<criteria>parent guardian provide write parental permission/informed consent , subject assent ( required local IRB ) . The child 2 year old 17 year old , inclusive ( time inform consent signing ) . A routine pediatric procedure expect require inpatient hospitalization postoperatively . Must inpatient study treatment period . Is expect investigator require use oral opioid treatment postoperative pain . Has ability read understand study procedure ability communicate meaningfully study investigator staff ( subject preverbal age read communicate meaningfully , subject 's parent guardian must meet criterion ) . Child expect experience moderate severe postoperative pain , investigator 's opinion , immediate postoperative period discontinuation intermittent administration IV opioid ( preferably morphine ) able tolerate oral medication . If female subject childbearing potential , must negative pregnancy test result screening ( serum ) day surgery prior surgery ( urine ) . Must vascular access facilitate blood draw . Has significant medical disease ( ) , laboratory abnormality , condition ( ) investigator 's judgment could compromise subject 's welfare , ability communicate study staff , complete study activity , would otherwise contraindicate study participation . There minimum value SpO2 inclusion study ; base investigator 's judgment . Has use opioids chronically ( e.g. , codeine , morphine , oxycodone , hydromorphone , &gt; 7 calendar day ) within previous 30 day . Has know hypersensitivity contraindication receive oral opioid ( ) . Has current active enteral malabsorption disorder . Has impair liver function ( e.g. , alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] ≥3 time upper limit normal [ ULN ] , bilirubin ≥3 time ULN ) , know active hepatic disease ( e.g. , hepatitis ) , evidence clinically significant chronic liver disease condition affect liver ( e.g. , chronic hepatitis ) may suggest potential increased susceptibility hepatic toxicity oral morphine exposure . Subjects previous history liver function impairment may enrol prior receipt screen laboratory test result . Has significantly impair renal function disease , evidence estimate glomerular filtration rate ( i.e. , creatinine level use Schwartz formula ) calculate less onethird normal applicable age study population . Subjects previous history kidney function impairment may enrol prior receipt screen laboratory test result . Has history substance abuse evidence current substance abuse , investigator 's opinion . Has receive epidural regional anesthesia within 12 hour prior first dose oral morphine sulfate . Has participate interventional clinical study ( investigational market product ) within 30 day screen , plan participate another clinical trial next 30 day .</criteria>
