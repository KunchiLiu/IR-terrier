	<detailed_description>Primary secondary prevention trial statin , well antiplatelet , clearly demonstrate drug able reduce cardiovascular event .

Recently investigator show statin ( 30 day treatment ) exert antioxidant effect via inhibition soluble gp91phox expression . The exact mechanism atorvastatin reduces NADPH oxidase , however , unclear . Recent study show statin treatment inhibits leukocyte ROCK activity , protein kinase implicate activation NADPH oxidase , mechanism seem independent lower cholesterol . Accelerated atherosclerosis typical feature type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Thus , patient T2DM 2- 4-fold increase risk cardiovascular disease ( CAD ) 2- 6-fold increase risk stroke . Platelets play major role etiology atherosclerotic disease , show significant decrease cardiovascular event patient treat aspirin , inhibitor COX1 prevent platelet thromboxane ( Tx ) A2 formation . Despite , interventional trial aspirin diabetic patient fail show beneficial effect . It previously demonstrate COX1 inhibition determines shift arachidonic acid metabolism towards pathway , lipooxygenase system . The investigator speculate COX1 inhibition could also associate increased conversion arachidonic acid platelet isoprostane formation ; increase platelet isoprostanes would balance inhibition TxA2 , thus hamper antiplatelet effect aspirin . As report , statin report down-regulate systemic isoprostanes mechanism may involve inhibition NADPH oxidase , therefore could interest examine statin improve antiplatelet effect aspirin via inhibition platelet isoprostanes . To study mechanism ( ) implicate gp91phox downregulation statin investigator plan present study patient hypercholesterolemia . Furthermore , second part study address evaluate synergistic role atorvastatin aspirin treatment Type 2 Diabetes mellitus patient .</detailed_description>
