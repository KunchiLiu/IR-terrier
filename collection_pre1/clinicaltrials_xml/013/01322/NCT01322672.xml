	<brief_summary>Recent data suggest anesthetic prolonged effect gene expression , protein synthesis processing well cellular function way investigator begin understand , especially young elderly . Within moment day emerge anesthesia - cardiac non-cardiac - patient experience mild severe disorientation change memory think ability without apparent cause . For vast majority patient , Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunction ( POCD ) , generally subside , `` diminish cognitive reserve '' - especially elderly , less education prior CNS event stroke early dementia - change memory executive function may persist . If prolonged three month , POCD link increase risk death . In 1-2 % elderly patient , problem may ultimately continue year , leading loss ability care early demise . Though may seem like small percentage , senior comprise 40 % 50-75 million surgical procedure perform annually next 20-30 year . This amount 70,000 - 200,000 elder affect , family , cost POCD longer-term care , lose wage , extend suffering remain high .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For 160 year , `` modern '' anesthesia provide immense benefit patient age . However , past several year , concern grow patient extremes age , anesthetic agent may harbor subtle , previously minimally examine , serious neurotoxic effect cause lasting decline function central nervous system ( CNS ) . For elderly , effect may manifest last post-operative deterioration memory capacity normal information processing result inability perform activity daily live ( ADLs ) eventual early demise . Unfortunately , even though ability evaluate anesthetic risk grow asymptotically virtually every organ system , brain remains neglected . And even though know good deal effect sit general anesthetic agent , still incomplete understand potential toxic effect anesthetic brain . Therefore , employ human surgical model ( endoscopic prostatectomy ) , propose pilot study 15 otherwise neurologically intact , ASA I - III , male , 65+ year age . After pre-enrollment screening ( MMSE &amp; BDI ) standard pre-op evaluation , subject undergo anatomic functional MRI study plus battery neurocognitive test ( NCT ) two time point approximately 2-3 week apart prior surgery . These pre-op study establish `` non-surgical control '' study well baseline post-op study . 2-3 week surgery , MRI NCT repeat . The study aim determine MRI demonstrate change CNS pre-op v post-op relate anesthesia surgery change might correlate NCT interval .</detailed_description>
