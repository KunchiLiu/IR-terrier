	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety insulin like growth factor bind protein 2 ( IGFBP-2 ) Th polyepitope plasmid base vaccine patient advanced stage recurrent ovarian cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine immunogenicity IGFBP-2 Th polyepitope plasmid base vaccine patient advanced stage recurrent ovarian cancer . II . To determine whether intermolecular epitope spread occurs generation IGFBP-2 specific Th1 immune response . III . To determine whether IGFBP-2 vaccination modulates T regulatory cell . OUTLINE : Patients receive pUMVC3-hIGFBP-2 multi-epitope plasmid DNA vaccine intradermally ( ID ) monthly 3 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month , every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
