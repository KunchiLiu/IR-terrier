	<detailed_description>This multi-center , single arm , open-label , prospective IIS study , enroll 40 recurrent MCL patients.The aim evaluate efficacy safety bortezomib , fludarabine cyclophosphamide treatment also analyze relationship NF-kB activity efficacy bortezomib treatment whether NF-kB activity predict MCL progression . This study consist three phase : screening/baseline phase , treatment phase follow-up phase end treatment . At screening/baseline phase , investigator obtain informed consent form , check inclusion/exclusion criterion collect follow data : demographic , medical history data , vital sign , ECG , MRI/CT/B-ultrasound/X-ray examination , physical examination , laboratory examination , pregnancy test ( female ) bone marrow biopsy aspiration . Pathological diagnosis mantle cell lymphoma establish lymph node biopsy tumor histopathological examination immunophenotyping . At time , ECOG-performance status , Fact/GOG-Ntx questionnaire NF-κB activity assess . During treatment period , patient treat bortezomib , fludarabine cyclophosphamide 28-day cycle . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) receive six cycle VF ( C ) treatment , continue stable disease ( SD ) stop 4-cycle treatment progressive disease ( PD ) also stop 2-cycle treatment . Due adverse event , patient may receive reduction deviate intend dose duration VF ( C ) treatment . These adjustment must accordance regulation protocol dose time adjustment . Maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) cyclophosphamide determine accordance standard `` 3+3 '' method , test three dose level , 150mg/m2 , 200mg/m2 250mg/m2 . Cyclophosphamide dose escalation test conduct first cycle , every three patient group . Patients ' enrollment compete among different site , step take 3 patient one group complete first cycle , efficacy safety completely evaluate , notification go next step CRO company . Subjects involve cyclophosphamide dose escalation test continue initial cyclophosphamide dose entire study , except possible dose adjustment determine investigator due DLT . After ascertain MTD , new patient administrate cyclophosphamide MTD . According dose escalation diagram , 18 patient involve dose escalation phase . Subjects discontinue treatment due cause DLT first cycle replace new participant enter dose escalation test . DLT define : grade 4 neutropenia lasting longer 7 day , grade 4 thrombocytopenia , neutropenic fever , grade 3 non-hematological toxicity ( except nausea , vomit alopecia ) ; grade 3 nausea , vomit diarrhea consider DLT still observe treatment . Please refer dose escalation diagram conduct dose escalation trial . Subjects follow 24 week end chemotherapy . In study , primary efficacy endpoint maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) cyclophosphamide combination treatment bortezomib fludarabine , complete response rate ( CR + CRu ) , overall response rate ( ORR ) . Main indicator evaluate every 2 cycle treatment period every 12 week follow-up period . Concomitant medication within 2 week enrollment study process need document . All adverse event report time sign date informed consent form obtain 30 day follow last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
