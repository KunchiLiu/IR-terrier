	<brief_summary>Background : - People autism autism spectrum disorder problem communication , behavior , socialize , many also intellectual developmental disability . The cause autism know , previous research suggest association autism immune change brain . Researchers interested use experimental radioactive drug ( 11C ) PBR28 , attach protein brain involve immune change , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan people without autism see great immune change autism . Objectives : - To determine positron emission tomography scan use evaluate change immune system protein brain people autism . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 45 year age diagnose either autism autism spectrum disorder , healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants screen physical examination psychological examination , medical history , questionnaires behavior mood , blood urine test . - Participants two image study brain separate study visit . The first study visit involve magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan provide baseline image brain . The second study visit involve PET scan radioactive chemical ( 11C ) PBR28 study immune system proteins brain . The MRI scan take 40 minute , PET scan take 2 hour . - Participants final study visit 24 hour PET scan provide final blood sample testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current estimate indicate 1 110 child affect autism . Despite striking statistic , remain unable describe pathophysiology autism , adequate treatment autism . The etiology patient autism unknown , emerge evidence support causal role immune activation autism . Multiple study provide clear evidence immune activation peripheral blood patient autism , demonstrate elevation immune marker ( IFN-gamma , IL-1RA , IL-6 , TNF-alpha ) . Studies also demonstrate immune activation cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) patient autism , evidence significant elevation cytokine TNF-alpha . Finally , three postmortem brain study report neuroimmune activation patient autism ( age 4-45 ) . Combined , three postmortem study show activation microglia astroglia elevation cytokine , histology stereology . While grow body literature support neuroimmune activation autism intriguing , current result present limitation . First , study assess brain live patient autism/ASDs . Second , convince evidence neuroimmune activation postmortem brain extract almost exclusively patient classical autism , intellectual disability common . As , evidence neuroimmune activation higher functioning patient autism autism spectrum disorder ( ASDs ) less robust . We propose determine whether neuroimmune activation present living brain patient autism . Furthermore , give heterogeneity autism , call , would like determine whether neuroimmune activation detectable high versus lower functioning patient autism/ASDs . We propose measure neuroimmune activation living brain patient utilize positron emission tomography ( PET ) radioligand [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 . This radioligand bind translocator protein ( TSPO ) , over-expressed activate microglia reactive astrocyte , demonstrate reliable marker neuroimmune activation various neuropsychiatric disorder . Because majority patient autism/ASD require propofol sedation remain motionless two hour scan , include control arm healthy volunteer without propofol order determine effect propofol [ ( 11 ) C ] PBR28 uptake . NIH develop setup clinical center administer sedation/anesthesia safe manner , make important study possible .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : PATIENTS WITH AUTISM OR ASD ( INCLUSION CRITERIA ) : 1 . Subjects must diagnosis autistic disorder ( 299.0 ) Asperger disorder ( 299.80 ) , determine use Diagnostic Statistical ManualIV ( DSMIV ) confirmation Autism Diagnostic InterviewRevised ( Lord 1997 ) and/or Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale ( ADOS ) . ( A diagnosis Pervasive Developmental Disorder , PDD , suffice protocol ) . 2 . Subjects must adults 1845 year old . 3 . Subjects must healthy base history physical examination . 4 . Subjects must `` binder '' [ 11C ] PBR28 determine via one two way : prior participation PET scan [ 11C ] PBR28 vitro test leukocyte . We find nonbinders markedly reduce affinity [ 3H ] PBR28 leukocyte membrane . The vitro bind show overlap value binder ( ~90 % ) nonbinders . 5 . Subjects must either provide informed consent , must assent combination inform consent legal guardian durable power attorney ( DPA ) . HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS ( INCLUSION CRITERIA ) : 1 . Subjects must adults 1845 year old . 2 . Subjects must healthy base history physical examination 3 . Subjects must binders [ 11 C ] PBR28 ( see point 4 detail ) 4 . Prior PET scan , healthy subject must within prior year MRI scan brain rule significant structural abnormality . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : PATIENTS WITH AUTISM OR ASD ( EXCLUSION CRITERIA ) : 1 . Any history alcohol substance dependence , condition may alter uptake [ 11C ] PBR28 . 2 . Any history alcohol substance abuse within past 6 month , condition may alter uptake [ 11C ] PBR28 . 3 . Schizophrenia . 4 . In addition diagnosis autistic disorder , ASD Asperger , Axis I disorder require inpatient hospitalization study , time enrollment worsen relative baseline . We completely exclude Axis I disorder , typical patient autism /ASD carry comorbid Axis I disorder , include Generalized Anxiety Disorder ( GAD ) , social phobia , obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) , dysthymia , Major Depressive Disorder . 5 . Intellectual quotient ( IQ ) less 30 , include low functioning patient would make experiment logistically challenge would broaden heterogeneity much . 6 . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality assess PI , medically responsible investigator consultant . 7 . Serious medical problem include limited chronic neurological disease multiple sclerosis , autoimmune disease , poorly control seizure disorder , serious cardiopulmonary disease . 8 . Active seizure disorder , define seizure past year antiepileptic medication seizure . 9 . Positive HIV status . 10 . Head trauma result period unconsciousness lasting longer 5 minute . 11 .
