	<detailed_description>This multiple-dose , randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , placebo- active-controlled , four arm , parallel group study evaluate effect Sativex QT/QTc interval . Within 30 day screen , eligible subject randomize one four treatment group . Baseline ECG measurement record specify time follow day , subject commence five day treatment Sativex placebo . On Day 5 , subject receive either moxifloxacin 400 mg ( Group 4 ) moxifloxacin placebo ( Groups 1 , 2 3 ) . Triplicate ECG measurement pharmacokinetic sample collect Day 5 . On day 1-5 , Safety ECG measurement also collect pre-dose 2 hour post-dose .
