	<brief_summary>Objectives : To evaluate role human histo-blood group antigens susceptibility Norovirus infection . Description Study Design : Healthy volunteer different blood type low antibody titer challenge strain challenge orally Norovirus CCCR inpatient facility . Subjects resistant ( non-secretors ) susceptible ( secretor ( either A , B O blood group ) ) challenge strain recruit . The challenge study conduct two group twenty , approximately ten secretor ten non-secretors . Three additional subject per group serve alternate event study subject unavailable become ineligible time inpatient study . Subjects monitor daily isolation facility least five day follow challenge daily clinical virological evaluation . Subjects return investigational site evaluation day discharge inpatient unit 30 day ( 28-35 day ) post challenge . Study Endpoints : Norovirus infection assess viral shedding , seroconversion clinical illness assess duration severity symptom</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Noroviruses single-stranded , positive-sense RNA virus cause acute gastroenteritis human . The prototype Norwalk virus ( NV ) identify large outbreak acute gastroenteritis elementary school Norwalk , Ohio , 1968 . Since , many strain describe name location first isolation . Genetically , Noroviruses belong one four genus within Caliciviridae ( CV ) . Phylogenetic analysis show Norovirus genus divide five genogroups genogroup divide genetic cluster ; least 30 genetic cluster Noroviruses identify . Noroviruses recognize important cause non-bacterial epidemic acute gastroenteritis , affect individual age , develop developed country . Such outbreak usually high attack rate occur child care center , school , restaurant , summer camp , hospital , nurse home , ship ( civilian military ) well deploy military troop . The virus highly contagious able survive environment extend period time . They spread contact environmental surface person-to-person transmission . Noroviruses normally cause moderate-to-severe diarrhea disease often incapacitate fatal young elderly . The important public health concern Noroviruses cause large water- food-borne outbreak , result virus classify Category B agent . Noroviruses also implicate several military outbreak . The `` Desert Shield virus '' ( DSV ) isolate US troop 1991 Gulf War subsequently identify Norovirus . Similarly recently report `` mysterious '' attack acute gastroenteritis affect British troop Afghanistan also cause Norovirus . Large outbreak Norovirus-associated gastroenteritis common US Navy ship , similar occur board cruise ship line . Surveillance acute gastroenteritis board five US Navy combat ship 1998-1999 show ship experience large outbreak Norovirus acute gastroenteritis deployment Pacific Indian Oceans , follow port visit . Because rapid spread disease , many department unit board ship unable function peak outbreak . Noroviruses difficult study : 1 ) genetically antigenically highly diverse multiple strain distinct genetic identity co-circulate community , make diagnosis disease control extremely difficult ; 2 ) virus cultivate cell culture 3 ) small animal model study Noroviruses exists . The molecular cloning prototype Norwalk Virus ( NV ) 1990 one co-investigators application allow rapid progress study Noroviruses genus ; however , many issue Norovirus infection , pathogenesis , immunology host range remain unknown . The discovery Norovirus receptor provide new opportunity evaluate pathogenesis epidemiology Noroviruses . A host genetic factor involve Norovirus infection originally suggest many researcher clone Noroviruses 1990s 20-30 % individual antibodies Noroviruses never infect follow challenge NV , outbreaks , individual remain healthy clustered family exposure Noroviruses ill family . Further , pre-existing antibody NV protective NV infection , individual high level antibody NV susceptible NV individual antibody . These observation indicate , addition immune response , must another factor ( ) control host-specificity Norovirus infection . We recently discover Noroviruses recognize human histo-blood group antigens receptor . Using recombinant capsid protein different Noroviruses represent different genetic cluster , identify four binding pattern Noroviruses human histo-blood group antigens , define host Lewis , secretor ABO blood type . This find provide new approach develop strategy control disease . Specifically , Noroviruses rely histo-blood group antigens surface intestinal epithelial cell receptor , compound inhibits interaction virus receptor could develop antiviral drug Noroviruses . This find provide basis protocol seek confirm relationship specific Norovirus susceptibility specific histo-blood group antigen presence well establish model evaluated future intervention ( drug vaccine ) . The specificity NV interaction sugar moiety histo-blood group antigens show specific block binding human milk secretor , monoclonal antibody specific secretor human blood-group antigen ( HBGAs ) , synthetic oligosaccharide conjugate contain secretor antigen , treatment tissue a1,2 fucosidase . NV also bind differentiated CaCo2 cell differentiate CaCo2 cell express human histo-blood group antigens . Transfection Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) cell a1,2-linked fucosyl-transferase cDNA allow attachment NV virus-like particle ( VLPs ) . The bound rNV VLPs internalize follow incubation cell 37oC . To investigate association secretor status susceptibility Norwalk virus ( NV ) , collaborate Dr. Christine Moe Emory University 's School Medicine volunteer challenge study . This study utilize prototype NV , first Norovirus strain use human challenge study . Saliva sample 77 NV-challenged volunteer test secretor status NV-binding . Fifty-five ( 71 % ) 77 volunteer secretor . Among 55 secretor , 34 ( 62 % ) infect NV follow challenge saliva 41 ( 75 % ) bound NV recombinant VLPs . None saliva sample 22 non-secretor volunteer bound NV virus-like particle ( VLPs ) none become infected follow NV challenge ; strongly suggest susceptibility NV determine least part ability host bind norovirus strain . More recently perform study determine whether strain Noroviruses similar pattern host-specificity extend binding pattern 7 base examination fourteen Noroviruses . The 7 pattern classify two group accord interaction three major epitope ( A/B , H Lewis ) HBGAs : A/B bind group Lewis-binding group . Strains A/B bind group recognize A and/or B H antigens , Lewis antigens , strain Lewis-binding group react Lewis and/or H antigens . This classification also result model Norovirus/HBGA interaction , maximum two binding site within receptor bind interface involve NV/HBGA interaction . The A , B H side chain responsible bind A/B binding strain Lewis epitopes responsible Lewis binding strain . Phylogenetic analysis show strain identical closely related binding pattern tend cluster , strain bind group find genogroups I II . Our result suggest Noroviruses wide spectrum host range human HBGAs play important role Norovirus evolution . Since human Noroviruses cultivate vitro infect animal , necessary perform human volunteer challenge study study pathobiology infection . The study concept Norovirus narrow host range fundamental pathogenesis immunology Noroviruses . Additionally , recently identify dozen compound specifically block Norovirus attachment receptor . The human challenge study also establish model use evaluation new compound regard capacity block virus replication ( anti-viral drug ) . Furthermore , study re-evaluate whether acquire immunity independent factor Norovirus infection may provide additional information host immunity potentially useful vaccine development . Finally , study allow bank Norovirus challenge strain collect diarrheal stool pass study subject . Banking additional specimen , mention , critical future clinical trial virus cultivate vitro must isolate human infected virus . A specific challenge study would use one challenge strain challenge strain use human clinical trial would separate IND FDA approval prior administration subject .</detailed_description>
