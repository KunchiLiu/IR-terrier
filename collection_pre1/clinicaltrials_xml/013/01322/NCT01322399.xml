	<brief_title>Structural Integration Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic , non-specific low back pain among burdensome health problem prevalence cost care . Up one third acute low back pain case may become chronic lead disability . A large fraction chronic case absent finding well-understood cause , i.e . neoplastic , infectious inflammatory condition , nerve compression , generally designate `` uncomplicated , '' `` non-specific , '' `` mechanical . '' Usual care typically include oral injected medication , physical therapy exercise . Therapeutic response difficult predict many outcome unsatisfactory , high rate relapse . Structural Integration ( SI ) alternative method manual therapy somato-sensory training purport improve biomechanical functioning body whole rather focus treatment specific symptom . SI deliver series ten treatment , refer `` Ten Series , '' approximately one hour duration . The Ten Series protocol include manipulation major joint anatomical segment . Each ten session aim achieve different , specify set biomechanical change regard contribute progressive approximation specific ideal posture movement . Forty ( 40 ) subject recruit among individual enter treatment chronic low back pain outpatient rehabilitation clinic Boston area . Following baseline measure , subject randomize equal probability ( 50/50 ) usual care alone versus usual care plus ten session SI . SI treatment provide qualified SI therapist private practice office . They supervise monthly basis co-investigator extensive prior experience clinical practice SI . Data collect baseline , end-of-treatment , endpoint . Baseline data collect prior subject 's first treatment appointment , endpoint data collect subject 20 week post-baseline . End-of-treatment measure conduct week follow subject 's completion assign treatment arm . Consequently , average time elapsed baseline end-of-treatment differ across two treatment arm , different amount time allow completion usual care alone ( 3-7 week ) versus usual care plus SI ( 10-15 ) week . Analysis relevant primary aim study conduct follow : The demographic characteristic candidate refer , subject enrol , dropout describe . Descriptive statistic , aggregate per treatment arm , compute data retention compliance treatment , use concurrent medication . Each adverse event characterize subject demographic treatment arm , also rat severity , likelihood relation study , expect versus unexpected . Analysis relevant secondary aim study conduct follow : Baseline endpoint change therapeutic outcome , cognitive-behavioral measure blood assay value compare across treatment arm use appropriate statistical test . Baseline endpoint change stand balance gait parameter analyze use method standard current literature . In addition appropriate statistical test , include visual inspection graphic display phase relationship rotational movement body segment gait . The association mechanistic parameter - cognitive-behavioral , biomechanical , blood biomarkers - primary secondary therapeutic outcome explore per treatment arm aggregate . Data change baseline end-of-treatment subject exploratory analysis within treatment arm . Comparison across arm inappropriate systematic variation average duration treatment usual care alone ( estimate 5 week ) versus usual care plus SI ( estimate 12.5 week ) . Analysis include exploration association change therapeutic outcomes one hand , mechanistic parameter , within treatment arm .</detailed_description>
