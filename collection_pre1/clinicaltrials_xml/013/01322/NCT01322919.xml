	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Evaluate Treatment Both Near Distance Vision Simultaneous Laser Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>LASIK surgical technique cornea reshape use laser provide visual correction . Typically , procedure correct long distance vision require use supplementary spectacle read near vision . The Technolas 217z Excimer Laser use deliver treatment approve use European Community treatment version correct separately near vision distance vision case need one correction . By use new software two consecutive treatment combine correct distance vision provide near vision component addition first treatment . This study help u answer 2 question : 1 . How accurately combine technique corrects distance near vision 2 . Whether correction adequate remove complete need supplementary near spectacle</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must least 45 year old old 85 year Subjects must read , understand , sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . Subjects must willing able return schedule follow examination 6 month surgery . Subjects must willing eye treat laser visit . Subjects study armI must +4 diopter ( D ) absolute spherical hyperopia ( spherical equivalent ) , +2.5 D refractive astigmatism ( NOT corneal astigmatism ) manifest subjective refraction eye . The spherical equivalent must +5.25 D. Subjects study armII must 7 diopter ( D ) absolute spherical myopia ( spherical equivalent ) , 4.0 D refractive astigmatism ( NOT corneal astigmatism ) manifest subjective refraction eye . The spherical equivalent must 9.00 D. Subjects must presbyopia determine agerelated need optical aid ( &gt; +1.50 D ) read best distance correction . Subjects screen successfully acceptance PresbyLasik simulation Subjects contact lens wearer must gas permeable ( GP ) lenses discontinue least 3 week soft lens discontinue least 1 week prior preoperative evaluation eye treat . Contact lens wearer wear contact lens amount time preoperative baseline examination operative visit must treat . Corneal topography normal . Subjects contact lens wearer must 2 central keratometry reading 2 manifest subjective refraction take preoperatively least one week apart . The refraction value must differ 0.50D defined manifest refraction spherical equivalent ( MRSE ) . The keratometry value must differ previous value 0.50D either meridian . High contrast , manifest , best spectaclecorrected logMAR distance visual acuity ( VA ) must correctable least 0.1 ( 20/25 6/7.5 ) eye . Subjects combination baseline corneal thickness plan operative parameter LASIK procedure would result less 250 micron remain posterior corneal thickness flap postoperatively . Eyes baseline manifest subjective refraction exhibit difference great 0.75D sphere power , difference great 0.50D cylinder power , difference cylinder axis 15 degree compare baseline cycloplegic subjective refraction . For manifest cylinder less 0.75D , difference cylinder axis take consideration . Subjects preoperative assessment ocular topography indicate one eye suitable candidate treatment base upon suggest computersimulated treatment plan . Any subject go comanaged ophthalmologist optometrist approve Technolas Perfect Vision GmbH Excimer laser Investigator . Subjects anterior segment pathology , include dry eye syndrome cataract Investigator 's opinion , would interfere best spectaclecorrected VA ( BSCVA ) successful treatment . Subjects evidence retinal vascular disease . Subjects residual , recurrent , active ocular disease , corneal abnormality Investigator 's opinion would interfere BSCVA successful treatment . Subjects sign keratoconus . Subjects unstable central keratometry reading irregular mire . Subjects undergone previous intraocular corneal surgery kind , include type excimer laser surgery either refractive therapeutic purpose . Subjects history Herpes simplex Herpes zoster keratitis . Subjects history glaucoma glaucoma suspect . Subjects immunocompromised carry diagnosis connective tissue disease , clinically significant atopic disease , diabetes , autoimmune disease acute chronic illness increase risk subject confound outcome study . Subjects take systemic medication likely affect wound heal corticosteroid antimetabolite . Subjects know pregnant , lactate , plan become pregnant course study . Subjects know sensitivity medication use standard LASIK . Subjects participate ophthalmic clinical trial clinical trial . Subjects ocular muscle disorder include strabismus nystagmus , disorder affect fixation . Subjects risk angle closure .</criteria>
