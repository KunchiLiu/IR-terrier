	<brief_summary>In study , would like explore hypothesis change metabolic state , induce alter hormone level pattern neural activity , affect experience anxiety human . We also investigate link high anxiety high caloric intake . Our aim characterize whether change current metabolic state systematically influence anxiety induce well establish behavioral task know threat shock . The neural region activate behavioral task healthy subject well characterize . We priori region interest include insula , anterior cingulate cortex , hypothalamus , amygdala , prefrontal cortex . As primary outcome , assess neural activation whole-brain functional magnetic resonance image determine whether brain region differentially engage subject experience anxiety across different metabolic state . We correlate change psychophysiological measure anxiety metabolic state .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Metabolic State Anxiety Human Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There evidence subjective experience world strongly influence metabolic state , status body 's energy reserve level hunger . Hormones regulate appetite , food ingestion body weight apparently also exert action neuroanatomical circuit involve generation psychological state . Previous research indicate individual 's metabolic state may influence susceptibility experience anxiety . Conversely , stress also modulate appetite body weight regulation . There many clinical implication bidirectional relationship stress/anxiety metabolic state/energy regulation two important one obesity eat disorder . In term obesity , high recidivism successful weight loss underscore limit use caloric restriction treat obesity . It unknown whether diet ( fast ) increase anxiety , eventually may undermine individual 's motivation restrict food intake . Research show anxiety increase appetite exacerbate physical psychological manifestation associate hunger . However , paucity experimental data establish whether metabolic change associate fasting influence experience stress possibly , individual 's ability continue diet extend period time . In set obesity anorexia nervosa , level metabolic hormone different find people normal body weight . It therefore likely activation brain region associate energy body weight regulation abnormal . Many brain region also involve control anxiety response . The fact high comorbidity anorexia nervosa anxiety disorder indicate potential contribution metabolic state perception stress . To good understand relationship metabolic state anxiety , examine whether change metabolic state influence anxiety human subject . We use whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) identify neural mechanism underlie metabolic state-dependent change response anxiety-inducing stress . In randomized crossover design , participant test well-established behavioral task elicits anticipatory anxiety two separate session differ respect metabolic state . We aim perform fine-grain analysis change neural physiological response anxiety-inducing task function metabolic state . Using fMRI well non-invasive psychophysiological measure , characterize whether systematic difference neural psychophysiological experience anxiety across different metabolic state obese compare lean individual .</detailed_description>
