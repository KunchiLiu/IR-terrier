	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers interested study environmental genetic factor play role health live condition people age . Since 2002 , U.S. National Institute Aging Icelandic Heart Association Research Institute conduct long-term study know Research Aging project collect personal data sample Icelandic men woman order study risk factor related disease disability old age . Researchers plan initiate second stage study . Objectives : - To collect additional personal information , medical record , blood sample individual previously provide material Research Aging Project Iceland . Eligibility : - Individuals previously participate Research Aging project association U.S. National Institute Aging Icelandic Heart Association Research Institute . Design : - Participants physical examination image analysis procedure hear eye test , provide information health diet , provide 100-ml blood sample test . - Participants also provide consent researcher consult data sample collect first stage Research Aging project .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In anticipation sequence human genome description human proteome , Age , Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study ( AGES ) initiate 2002 . AGES design examine risk factor , include genetic susceptibility gene/environment interaction , relation disease disability old age . The study multidisciplinary , provide detailed phenotype relate cardiovascular , neurocognitive ( include sensory ) , musculoskeletal system , body composition metabolic regulation . Relevant quantitative trait , subclinical indicator disease , medical diagnosis identify use biomarkers , image , physiologic indicator . The AGES sample drawn establish population-based cohort , Reykjavik Study . This cohort men woman born 1907 1935 follow Iceland since 1967 Icelandic Heart Association . The AGES cohort , cardiovascular risk factor assessment earlier life detail late- life phenotype quantitative trait , create comprehensive study age nest relatively genetically homogeneous old population . This approach facilitate identification genetic factor contribute healthy age well chronic condition common old age .</detailed_description>
