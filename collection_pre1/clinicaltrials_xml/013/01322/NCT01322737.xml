	<brief_summary>This feasibility trial evaluate ability SuMO Tissue Access Resection System ( Apollo Endosurgery , Austin , Texas ) . The SuMO System utilizes balloon create submucosal pocket electrosurgical cut device resect mucosa . The SuMO elevate tissue underlie muscularis use balloon distend submucosa , similar currently perform injectable saline standard EMR . After dissection lesion , separate cutting device utilized resect tissue cut around border target tissue . If need , standard loop snare use complete mucosal resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Trial Evaluate Ability SuMO Tissue Access Resection System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subject already schedule segmental colectomy gastrectomy . The colectomy gastrectomy specimen prepare side table ex vivo endoscopic procedure . The end stomach colon , already staple close ligate allow insufflation . The endoscope place excised organ SuMO System device deploy away area excise pathologic tissue , disrupt pathologist 's evaluation excise tissue . The specimen open grossly examine actual completeness submucosal pocket resection . Mucosal muscular wall disruption assess . Again , interference underlie pathology perform . If sufficient specimen present , SuMO procedure may repeat specimen . Following performance EMR SUMO balloon system ex vivo colon specimen , resect piece tissue site resection evaluate pathologically H E stain . Specifically , depth resection ex vivo colon specimen determine . In addition , level dissection remove piece mucosa also identify . During procedure still image video record maybe capture , however image take removed specimen . There patient identifier image DVD 's take procedure . No clinical follow require , treated area already resect risk patient .</detailed_description>
