	<brief_summary>With estimate &gt; 2 million woman undetected breast cancer United States , need improve early detection imperative . Early diagnosis woman key minimize quality life-years lose disease optimize success treatment . Evidence exist support find systemic spread early event natural history breast cancer , manifest release single cancer cell incident , clinically undetectable tumor , circulate bloodstream deposit within remote tissue . Reliable accurate detection circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) possible simple peripheral venous blood draw . This study hypothesize woman CTCs sign malignancy clinically undetectable disease . This study attempt validate technology breast cancer screen test acquire data determine clinical validity utility propose screen methodology relatively young , ethnically diverse population eligible military health care beneficiary . Furthermore , study attempt bank identify CTCs order perform additional molecular analysis future . The specific aim develop simple , reliable , cost-effective , clinically relevant breast cancer screen test order identify subclinical disease early natural history subject risk progression clinically apparent disease ensue decade . The ultimate goal decrease treatment-related morbidity cause-specific mortality breast cancer . An experienced team devote care patient breast disease assemble achieve goal .</brief_summary>
