	<brief_summary>Forty percent pregnant woman United States woman never give birth . As group , sometimes complication pregnancy , information previous pregnancy identify might problem . Very little research do group . The Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study : Monitoring Mothers-to-be ( nuMoM2b ) collect data diverse population 10,000 woman first baby carry one baby . The woman enrol early pregnancy undergo research assessment four time pregnancy . Data collect interview , self-completed data form , clinical measurement , ultrasound , collection storage blood sample , urine sample , fluid vagina cervix . Some information come medical record . A subset woman may ask participate substudies collect information sleep breathing , sleep pattern quality , area possibly relate birth outcome . The goal research find way identify woman group might develop problem pregnancy use information improve health pregnant woman baby future . The study focus pregnancy problem like high blood pressure , baby bear much early small baby .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study : Monitoring Mothers-to-be</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) establish Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study : Monitoring Mothers-to-be ( nuMoM2b ) study woman current pregnancy lead first delivery ( nulliparas ) . About 40 % pregnant woman United States nulliparas . Because little information previous pregnancy outcome available guide assignment risk mitigate intervention , adverse pregnancy outcomes nulliparas especially unpredictable . The underlying mechanisms adverse pregnancy outcome preterm birth , preeclampsia , fetal growth restriction stillbirth interrelate therefore evaluated part study . The information gain benefit woman pregnant consider pregnancy physician . In addition , knowledge support future research aim improve care health outcomes critical group at-risk woman currently understudy . The study prospective cohort study racially/ethnically/geographically diverse population 10,038 nulliparous woman singleton gestation . The woman undergo intensive research assessment course pregnancy study mechanisms prediction adverse pregnancy outcome ( APOs ) woman first pregnancy . The APOs primary interest preterm birth , preeclampsia fetal growth restriction . The goal study 1 ) determine maternal characteristic , include genetics , epigenetics , physiological response pregnancy well environmental factor influence and/or predict adverse pregnancy outcome ; 2 ) identify specific aspect placental development function lead adverse pregnancy outcome ; 3 ) characterize genetic , growth , developmental parameter fetus associate adverse pregnancy outcome . Eight academic medical center site primary responsibility enrollment follow-up study participant . Several site collect data additional academic research center nearby hospital ( subsites ) . A Data Coordinating Analysis Center ( DCAC ) provide input protocol , manage data , analyze data . Investigators institution establish partnership NICHD staff develop implement study protocol ancillary study acquire analyze data identify biomarkers understand mechanism prediction preterm birth adverse pregnancy outcome . Nulliparous woman utero singleton gestation 6 week 0 day 13 week 6 day pregnancy recruit eight clinical site subsites . Mechanisms create various prenatal clinic associate site identify eligible nulliparous woman singleton pregnancy . Once enrol , participant follow duration pregnancy research staff clinical site . Study visit schedule four time pregnancy : 6 week 0 day 13 week 6 day estimate gestational age ( EGA ) , 16 week 0 day 21 week 6 day EGA , 22 week 0 day 29 week 6 day EGA , time delivery . Data collect personal interview , self-administered questionnaire , clinical measurement , chart abstraction , collection biological specimen ( blood , urine , cervico-vaginal fluid ) . Additional data ( i.e. , sleep breathing assessment , actigraphy , fetal adrenal gland measurement ) collect ancillary research study subsets enrolled woman . The set-ups screening , enrollment follow-up participant vary clinical site subsite . However , set , clinical site staff include study investigator , research nurse , research assistant sonographers . Clinical site staff train interview participant , collect process sample , conduct various research test , input data . Data manage DCAC . Specimens store NICHD specimen repository later analysis .</detailed_description>
