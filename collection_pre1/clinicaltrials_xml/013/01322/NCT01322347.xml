Received IV iron therapy 6 month 2 week prior enrollment order replace iron loss result hemodialysis procedure . Mean Screening Hgb ≥ 9.5 ≤ 11.5 gram per deciliter ( g/dL ) . Mean Screening Transferrin Saturation ( TSAT ) ≥ 15 % ≤ 40 % . Mean Screening serum ferritin ≥ 200 ≤ 800 microgram per liter ( µg/L ) . If administer epoetin , darbepoetin , CERA , epoetin dose ≤ 45,000 Units ( U ) /week , darbepoetin dose ≤ 200 microgram ( µg ) /week , CERA dose ≤ 400 microgram ( µg ) /month four week prior enrollment . Main Patient live kidney donor identify livingdonor kidney transplant schedule . ( Note : Patients await deceaseddonor transplant need exclude . ) Vascular access dialysis femoral catheter nontunneled catheter . Received total &gt; 800 milligram ( mg ) IV iron 8 week prior enrollment . If administer ESA , route administration change ESA dose change &gt; 35 % ( i.e. , [ max min dose ] /max dose &gt; 0.35 ) 2 week prior screen . Serum albumin &lt; 3.0 gram per deciliter ( g/dL ) time 8 week prior enrollment . Red Blood Cell ( RBC ) whole blood transfusion within 12 week prior enrollment . Stage 2 : Main Patient currently enrol Stage 1 runin period study . Undergoing chronic hemodialysis three four time per week chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , expect remain hemodialysis three four time weekly able complete duration study . Mean Hgb ≥ 9.5 ≤ 11.5 g/dL three recent consecutive everyweek measurement prior randomization .
