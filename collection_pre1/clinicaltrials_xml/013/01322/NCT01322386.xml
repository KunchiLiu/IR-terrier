	<brief_summary>The goal propose work two fold : Firstly , see antibiotic vancomycin may use early treatment Biliary Atresia ( BA ) Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ( PSC ) . The investigator hope learn effect Vancomycin bacteria present stool , body fluid intestinal tissue someone BA PSC mechanism . Secondly , investigator hope learn characterize human intestinal microbial community ( microbiome : collection collectivity microorganism ) use molecular method , examine mechanisms interaction host microbiome use genomic approach , determine microbiome preserve local health promotes pathology . The investigator focus primary sclerosing cholangitis , biliary atresia , well state health . The composition associate microbiome assess base ribosomal DNA RNA sequence , attention give richness ( diversity ) , evenness ( relative abundance ) , variation respect time , person , anatomic niche . Host response adjacent mucosal surface assess base genome-wide gene expression pattern .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gastrointestinal Microbiota Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis Biliary Atresia With Vancomycin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As many 55 subject ( 35 BA PSC 20 Controls ) involve . We also recruit 20 adult patient either BA , PSC . The patient recruit Lucile Children 's Hospital , Stanford Medical Center , Stanford Redwood City Campus patient primary sclerosing cholangitis , biliary atresia intestinal disorder upper low endoscopy indicate routine medical management . There may participant 18 year age although vast majority 18 . Vancomycin therapy administer BA patient ( 4 week ) PSC patient . The PSC patient blood test would do various interval : start Vancomycin ; every month Liver Function Tests normalize ; Liver Function Tests normalize ; stop Vancomycin Vancomycin month 1,3,6,12 , 24 . Fecal sample take . In addition , patient already undergo either upper low intestinal endoscopy routine diagnostic therapeutic purpose ask agree endoscopic mucosal brushing addition mucosal biopsy . Some patient diagnosis primary sclerosing cholangitis , biliary atresia , intestinal disorder upper low endoscopy indicate routine medical management . Others low intestinal finding ( polyp ) complaint ( e.g . occult blood stool ) , upper intestinal finding ( dyspepsia , reflux ) , undergo low endoscopy ( colonoscopy ) upper endoscopy routine medical management . Up 2 biopsy obtain gastric mucosa many 6 intestinal site patient . In addition follow brushing take : 2 mid-esophagus , 2 less curvature stomach , 2 second portion duodenum near ampulla . 2 jejunum 5 cm Ligament Trietz , 2 ileum 10 cm ileocecal valve . We also obtain brush tongue . A sample saliva take . Fecal specimen also collect prior bowel preparation endoscopy/colonoscopy . If BA patient already Kasai portoenterostomy , do remove diseased bile duct , would like take biopsy bile duct . If patient liver biopsy clinically do would like keep 2mm section . If patient intraoperative cholangiogram evaluate bile duct collect 2.5 cc . bile fluid . With regard control , intestinal disorder also clinical endoscopy do , would request midesophagus biopsy ; biopsy antrum 2 biopsy 4th portion duodenum . Cell brush take follow area : 2 mid-esophagus , 2 less curvature stomach , 2 second portion duodenum near ampulla . 2 jejunum 5 cm Ligament Trietz , 2 ileum 10 cm ileocecal valve . We also obtain brush tongue . A sample saliva take . If patient colonoscopy do part clinical care would request biopsy ileum , cecum , transverse descend rectum . We would also ask saliva sample . The blood test would do various interval : start Vancomycin ; every month Liver Funtion Tests normalize ; Liver Function Tests normalize ; stop Vancomycin Vancomycin month 1,3,6,12 24 .</detailed_description>
