	<brief_summary>HCC ( Hepato-cellular Carcinoma ) fifth frequent cancer human prevalence grow . The effective treatment HCC surgical include resection liver transplantation ; however , 20 % patient treat surgically . Local interventional therapy , radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation transarterial embolization also use . Recurrence rate high , extrahepatic disease develop 30 % case 20 % liver transplantation . Systemic treatment thus option . Sorafenib ( multi-kinase inhibitor ) first agent significantly improve overall survival advance HCC . However , drug serious side effect expensive . PET/CT F18-FDG common tool systemic evaluation stag various tumor . The value FDG PET evaluation HCC controversial , particular due unique metabolic pathway glucose HCC cell . Since 2007 study suggest feasibility FDG PET/CT monitor local recurrence ( especially RF ) metastatic spread HCC , include detection active disease suspect AFP ( alphafoetoprotein ) elevation . Early detection treatment response therapy whole body FDG PET/CT allow change treatment early possible , tumor non-responsive serious side effect appear depletion body resource . The aim study investigate contribution FDG PET/CT assessment treatment response .</brief_summary>
