	<brief_summary>The pathophysiology pain related fibromyalgia understood . This condition difficult diagnose treat . One clue may tender point ( area hurt typical fibromyalgia ) densely locate near clavicle . This also area brown fat locate human . Brown fat typically use maintain body temperature . Stress ( cool temperature special diet , i.e. , high fat , low carbohydrate ) appear worsen pain see fibromyalgia . We hypothesize mechanism pain disease relate activate brown fat neural mechanism . The nerve brown fat also go adjacent muscle skin . So , brown fat turn increase amount , collateral nerve may cause pain tender point . The central hypothesis stress temperature diet activate brown fat . Patients fibromyalgia great activation volume brown fat . Neuralgia related stress may etiology pain . If hypothesis proven , several drug market could deploy correct patient ' problem . Therefore , project , successful , lead clinical trial drug fibromyalgia patient .</brief_summary>

The central hypothesis stress temperature diet activate brown fat . Patients fibromyalgia great activation volume brown fat . Neuralgia related stress may etiology pain . If hypothesis proven , several drug market could deploy correct patient ' problem . Therefore , project , successful , lead clinical trial drug fibromyalgia patient . The initial study phase involve five subject - one healthy volunteer four woman fibromyalgia . These five subject one visit include several hour warm room cold room . Nociceptive flexion reflex ( NFR ) test conduct temperature-controlled room . We anticipate conduct initial phase last two week November 2010 . The main study project entail three visit 20 subject ( 10 healthy control subject 10 woman fibromyalgia . No treatment plan project . Procedures include : ) screen interview , diagnostic interview , analog rating scale , psychological psychiatric rating scale ; b ) review medical record diagnosis fibromyalgia certain ; c ) pain measure palpation tender point measurement biceps reflex objectively measure amount pain visit , ) Visit A include special diet breakfast 8 AM rest room temperature 2.5 hour ( know turn brown fat ) receive FDG ( radioactive sugar ) PET/CT scan measure metabolism e ) Visit B require another diet rest 2.5 hour ~62Â°F ( know turn brown fat ) along PET/CT scan measure metabolism structural MRI examine brain structure measure volume brown fat chest ; f ) blood sample collect measure stress hormone warm cold period ; g ) pregnancy test PET/CT MRI .</detailed_description>
