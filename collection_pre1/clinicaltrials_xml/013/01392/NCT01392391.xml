This randomize intervention study compare 6 month task orient exercise program versus control group receive best medical stroke care accord American Stroke Association `` Get Guidelines '' .

	<detailed_description>Stroke lead profound cardiovascular deconditioning secondary abnormality paretic skeletal muscle worsen cardiovascular health . Conventional rehabilitation focus restoration daily function , without adequate exercise stimulus address deconditioning muscle abnormality may propagate insulin resistance ( IR ) worsen risk type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) recurrent stroke . By time individual reach chronic stroke ( &gt; 6 month ) , report hemiparetic body composition abnormality include paretic leg muscular atrophy , increase intramuscular area fat , major shift fast myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) . All factor promote IR , link reduced muscle protein synthesis age may reversible exercise . We also find elevated tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ) paretic leg muscle , suggest inflammation may affect protein synthesis breakdown , similar sarcopenia aging . Yet , prior study consider stroke catabolic syndrome modifiable early exercise improve muscle cardiometabolic health . Aim # 1 . Paretic ( P ) non-paretic ( NP ) leg mixed muscle protein synthesis breakdown feed fasted state , TNFα expression , thigh muscle volume strength . Hypothesis 1 : Paretic leg reduce muscle protein synthesis increase breakdown compare non-paretic leg ; TEXT increase mixed muscle protein synthesis reduce breakdown increase muscle volume strength mechanism ( ) reduce inflammation paretic leg , compare control . Aim # 2 . Glucose tolerance , fitness , muscle phenotype . Hypothesis 2 : TEXT improve fitness level , insulin glucose response oral glucose challenge , increase paretic leg slow twitch ( slow MHC ) muscle molecular phenotype . This randomized study investigate hypothesis African-Jamaican adult recent hemiparetic stroke , 6 month TEXT across sub-acute chronic phase stroke improve paretic leg muscle cardiometabolic health , compare control receive best medical care . Phase 1 consists recruitment screen individual mild moderate hemiparetic stroke UWI Accident Emergency Room Neurology Stroke Clinics . Phase 2 : Subjects hemiparetic gait ≤ 8 week post-stroke wheelchair bound bed approach informed consent , medical , neurologic , blood test , treadmill ( TM ) exercise test determine study eligibility . Phase 3 baseline test include measure fitness , oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , body composition , bilateral vastus lateralis muscle biopsy , stable isotope measure protein synthesis breakdown . Phase 4 : Eligible subject randomize 6 month 3x/week TEXT control group best medical care alone include American Stroke Association ( ASA ) physical activity guideline recommendation walk 4x/week . Randomization stratify base glucose tolerance ( normal vs. abnormal ) gait deficit severity . Subjects limit 3 month test fitness level ( VO2 peak ) , body composition , fast glucose insulin level document natural history ( control ) temporal profile exercise-mediated adaptation ( TEXT ) transition sub-acute chronic phase stroke . Phase 5 6-month post-intervention testing .</detailed_description>
