	<brief_summary>N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) medication Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve several medical us , dissolve mucus patient breathe problem , treat overdose acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) , protect kidney toxic substance . Some recent study suggest NAC could useful treatment disorder include addiction . One purpose study determine whether NAC alters level brain glutamate ( chemical excites brain cell ) . The main purpose determine whether NAC affect much cocaine people use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inpatient Phase : Participants live inpatient research unit least 2 consecutive night possibly 20 consecutive night . Participants visitor allow leave inpatient unit ( except staff escort ) unless drop study . We collect daily urine sample make sure participant use drug except study . In addition , morning , afternoon even participant receive capsule contain placebo ( blank ) different dose N-acetylcysteine . Participants take part multiple trial ( 9 session ) give standard amount powder ( identify Drug A Drug B ) inhale straw nose . The powder contain placebo ( powder contain drug ) different dos cocaine . We measure participant feel use questionnaire record vital signsâ€”including breathe rate , blood oxygen level , heart rate , blood pressure . Participants also ask perform 3-hour computer task allow work Drug A , Drug B , money . At end computer task participant receive amount drug earn receipt amount money earn . On Monday inpatient stay , participant escort Harper Hospital special type magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , know magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . This non-invasive way study brain chemistry . Participants take part total two ( 2 ) MRI scan . The total length brain scan 2 hour . Additionally Monday inpatient stay test sensitivity participant brain magnetic stimulation . A small magnet place top head small electrical current generate inside brain . This procedure call transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . We stimulate part brain control finger movement . Three record electrode ( metal sensor like use EKG ) place right thumb index finger . We measure effect different amount magnetic stimulation muscle activity thumb index finger ( see computer screen ) . We also ask participant push lever finger part procedure . These task last 2 hour . To complete study , minimum stay 16 inpatient night require . The maximum stay 20 inpatient night .</detailed_description>
