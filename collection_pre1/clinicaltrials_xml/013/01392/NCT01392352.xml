	<brief_summary>Pazopanib new cancer drug work limit growth new blood vessel tumour . About half patient take pazopanib develop high blood pressure ( hypertension ) . This side effect make patient reduce stop cancer treatment , cause health problem . The aim study find exactly drug cause high blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HYPAZ : Hypertension Induced Pazopanib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For study , 52 patient different cancer type take pazopanib tablet 12 week . They visit clinic every 1-2 week treatment , final safety check 4 week stop drug ( 10 visit 18 week ) . At every visit , heart tracing , check patient 's blood pressure blood urine chemical ( check health , see level chemical change ) . Patients check blood pressure home every day . They also wear blood pressure monitor 24 hour 3 occasion ( normal daily activity ) . Patients 1 2 CT scan 3 MRI scan study . On three occasion , variety specialise test measure patient 's blood vessel work . Patients may choose continue take drug 12 week treatment , doctor feel appropriate . Understanding pazopanib cause high blood pressure help u advise doctor treat high blood pressure effectively , patient continue take cancer treatment safely . This research might also lead development new cancer drug future , cause serious side effect .</detailed_description>

Measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 . A measurable lesion define lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥ 20mm use conventional technique . Patients ovarian cancer prostate cancer , validate tumour marker ( CA125 PSA ) use clinically monitor response , require measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 . 4 . ECOG performance status 0 1 . 5 .

Hypersensitivity agent use forearm blood flow study ( acetylcholine , sodium nitroprusside , LNMMA ) 5 . Difficult upper limb arterial access ( assess easily palpable brachial artery ) 6 . Anticoagulant therapy ( warfarin ) . ( Subcutaneous heparin allow need omit visit V2 , V3 VHyp ) . 7 . Pregnant lactate female 8 . History clinical evidence active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases . 9 . Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may increase risk GI bleed 10 . Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may affect absorption investigational product 11 . Presence uncontrolled infection 12 . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 480 msec use Bazett 's formula 13 . History pulmonary embolism untreated deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) within past 6 month 14 . Prior major surgery trauma within 28 day prior first dose and/or presence nonhealing wound , fracture , ulcer . 15 . Evidence active bleeding bleed diathesis 16 . Known endobronchial lesion and/or lesion infiltrate major pulmonary vessel increase risk pulmonary hemorrhage . Note : Lesions infiltrate major pulmonary vessel ( contiguous tumour vessel ) exclude ; however , presence tumour touching , infiltrate ( abut ) vessel acceptable ( CT contrast strongly recommend evaluate lesion ) . ) Large protrude endobronchial lesion main lobar bronchus exclude ; however , endobronchial lesion segment bronchus allow . ii ) Lesions extensively infiltrate main lobar bronchus exclude ; however , minor infiltration wall bronchus allow . 17 .
