	<brief_summary>1 . Rationale The inter-individual pain experience immediately surgery considerable . In addition , number patient develop chronic post surgery pain ( CPSP ) . Patients undergo surgery breast cancer risk develop acute post surgical pain well CPSP . Recently , group patient chronic back pain , demonstrate subjectively report pain associate specific electroencephalography ( EEG ) parameter , namely N2 P3 component pain event-related potential ( ERP ) . It conclude ERP associate self-reported pain daily life two week measurement . This result current hypothesis EEG may predictor postoperative pain . 2 . Study design Prospective cohort study . Within 2 week surgery , 150 patient undergo EEG measurement five 'vulnerability ' task . The experiment repeat 6 month postoperatively . Study population : Female patient breast cancer undergo breast surgery , age 18 65 year . 3 . Main study parameters/endpoints Primary outcome postoperative pain , measure pain diary 4 day postoperatively . Secondary outcome development chronic post surgery pain quality life . The main goal develop comprehensive prediction model acute chronic postoperative pain breast cancer surgery , base EEG result five vulnerability experiment .</brief_summary>
