	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetic Profiles Two Formulations CO-1.01 Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine use alone combination chemotherapy treatment several solid tumor type , include pancreatic cancer , NSCLC , ovarian cancer . Unfortunately , many patient fail derive benefit treatment . No clinical molecular marker establish predict benefit gemcitabine therapy , patient treat empirically evidence disease progression worsen performance status . The potential human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 ( hENT1 ) expression predict survival gemcitabine-treated patient study , data suggest patient low level tumor cell hENT1 expression derive less benefit gemcitabine treatment patient high level tumor cell hENT1 expression . Furthermore , PK profile CO-1.01 gemcitabine different , may also favorably influence vivo antiproliferative effect CO-1.01 . These data support hypothesis patient express low level hENT1 derive minimal benefit gemcitabine , receive benefit CO-1.01 ( gemcitabine elaidate ) enter tumor cell hENT1-independent fashion . The formulation CO-1.01 currently use clinical study contain 15 mg/mL gemcitabine-5'-elaidate solubilized purified phospholipid . Recently , Clovis Oncology develop 30 mg/ml formulation characterize study .</detailed_description>
