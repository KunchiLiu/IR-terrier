	<brief_summary>To determine effect aerobic exercise hippocampal volume severity psychotic symptom population psychosis patient compare healthy age/gender match volunteer . Psychosis patient often suffer number cognitive difficulty , include poor memory function , poor problem-solving capacity difficulty attention concentration . These problem well address current clinical treatment . Evidence age research strongly suggest increase cardiovascular fitness may provide numerous cognitive benefit promote brain growth , particularly frontal lobe hippocampus . The current study measure effect aerobic exercise brain volume population chronic psychosis patient determine 1 ) hippocampal volume increase response exercise 2 ) parallel improvement cognitive function occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This 12-week , randomized trial two parallel group . Throughout trial , subject treat prescribed dose medication . Once informed consent obtain , subject healthy volunteer randomly assign either aerobic resistance exercise program ( N = 24 per diagnostic group two exercise condition ) . Patients continue receive antipsychotic prescribed medication . Healthy volunteer data use establish normal exercise-induced neuroplasticity non-psychiatric , non-medicated population . All training conduct Riverview Hospital fitness facility dedicate exercise training facility University British Columbia . All exercise session monitor trained research assistant ( RAs ) guidance Canadian Society Exercise Physiology-Certified Exercise Physiologists ( CSEP-CEPs ) . The RAs receive pre-study exercise training CSEP-CEPs . During course study , train intensity change accord individual participant 's response need via CSEP-CEPs RAs .</detailed_description>
