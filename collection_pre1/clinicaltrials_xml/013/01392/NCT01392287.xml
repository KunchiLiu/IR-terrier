Do old adult treatment resistant Major Depression low level chemical brain call NAAG old adult without Major Depression ? 2 . Do old adult naturally low NAAG level well memantine hydrochloride treatment old adult higher amount chemical memantine hydrochloride treatment ? 3 . Do old adult treatment resistant depression problem memory concentration old adult without depression ? The investigator also interested look electrical neuronal activity brain , spiritual belief , fatigue relationship depression . The investigator hypothesize : 1 . Older individual treatment resistant Major Depression low level NAAG compare age-matched old control subject . 2 . Older adult treatment resistant depression low NAAG level well treatment memantine hydrochloride old adult memantine high NAAG level . 3 . Older adult depression good test attention executive function treatment memantine hydrochloride . 4 . Healthy control good test attention executive function old adult depression .</brief_summary>
