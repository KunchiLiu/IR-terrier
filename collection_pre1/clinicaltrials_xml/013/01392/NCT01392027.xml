	<detailed_description>The recently fund GI SPORE , University Michigan , focus pancreatic colon disease . This protocol focus collect data , blood sample , tissue subject pancreatic disease , include pancreatic cancer , pancreatic cyst , pancreatitis , diabetic control , jaundice/biliary obstruction control , otherwise healthy control . A SPORE NCI-funded , Specialized Program Research Excellence , specific requirement . Those requirement include 4 project clinical basic science Co-PI several COREs , include biospecimen core . Each project human subject component require separate protocol IRB submission project begin . The specific population recruit determine aim project 2 need create repository part biospecimen core ( please see grant detail aim 2 project ) . A specially design database build study handle data aspect . Our collaborator Dartmouth College significant experience manage data partner work EDRN ( PI Brenner ) . Case report form data collection tool develop used populate database . All actual data completely deidentified per HIPAA regulation . We intend model data specimen collection model use work NCI-EDRN . This include customized database , use kit pre-labled , bar-coded aliquot , standardize data collection form ( CRFs ) .</detailed_description>
