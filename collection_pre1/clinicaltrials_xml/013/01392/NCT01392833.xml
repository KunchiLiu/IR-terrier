	<brief_summary>Some year ago investigator design randomised trial prospectively evaluate whether add low-dose azathioprine ( 1.5 mg/kg/day six month ) steroid ( methylprednisolone 1 g i.v . three consecutive day month 1 , 3 5 , plus oral prednisone 0.5 mg/kg every day six month ) improve long-term renal survival adult IgAN patient proteinuria high 1g/24 hour plasma creatinine &lt; =2.0 mg/dl . In order test efficacy combination steroid azathioprine various degree renal function deterioration extend trial patient advanced disease ( serum creatinine high equal 2 mg/dl ) without time limit renal biopsy . Treatment last one year : methylprednisolone 1 g i.v . three consecutive day begin month 1 , 3 5 , follow oral prednisone 0.5 mg/kg every day six month , 0.2 mg/kg every day 6 month . The primary outcome renal survival ( 50 % increase plasma creatinine baseline ) ; secondary outcome proteinuria time number type adverse event two group assess every month first six month , every two month 6th 12th month every three month thereafter . The planned duration follow five year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It know well establish IgAN outcome often unfavourable , end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) occur 5-25 % case within ten year 25-50 % case within 20 year . The degree impairment renal function presentation certainly important predictor poor outcome . However , although high serum creatinine time diagnosis may allow detection patient likely progress ( perhaps may get benefit therapy ) , establish treatment exists advance IgAN . This likely explain fact renal impairment often associate renal biopsy index chronicity glomerular sclerosis , tubulointerstitial atrophy fibrosis . It also suggest disease , chronic nephropathy , `` point return '' non-immunological mechanism consider play central role relentless progression . Most patient IgAN develop ESRD middle age represent significant problem patient also social economic burden society whole . For reason , wait specific therapy able complete prevent progression IgAN , possibility delay begin renal replacement therapy year could consider important goal patient . In regard , investigator impress result uncontrolled retrospective study combine treatment corticosteroid 18 month azathioprine 24 month . Although treatment seem ineffective patient normal renal function ( low number event very-slowly progressive group ) lack randomisation lead severe bias concern choice patient treat ( high risk patient ) , impaired renal function , small percentage treat subject progressive course ( 20.5 % vs 63.4 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) . Similarly , Tsuruya et al . retrospectively found combination therapy prednisolone cyclophosphamide effective reduce urinary protein excretion slow rate progression histologically advance IgAN . Given consideration , investigator decide test efficacy combination steroid azathioprine various degree renal function deterioration extend trial patient advanced disease ( serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl ) . Considering high likelihood patient certain degree sclerosis focal segmental glomerulosclerosis longer treatment seem lead slightly good result term achievement maintenance partial complete remission , patient amendment II investigator decide continue treatment steroid azathioprine low dose six month , overall one-year treatment duration . Study design The patient randomly allocate treatment steroid ( methylprednisolone 1 g i.v . three consecutive day begin month 1 , 3 5 , plus oral prednisone 0.5 mg/kg every day six month , 0.2 mg/kg every day six month ) plus azathioprine 1.5 mg/kg/day six month 50 mg/day six month ( experimental group ) steroids alone ( methylprednisolone 1 g i.v . three consecutive day begin month 1 , 3 5 , plus oral prednisone 0.5 mg/kg every day six month , 0.2 mg/kg every day six month ) ( control group ) . If leukocyte count 3,000 5,000 mmc dose azathioprine halve ; leukocyte count 3,000 mmc , azathioprine suspend . The planned duration follow five year . Similarly original protocol , presence proteinuria relapse without increase plasma creatinine 50 % baseline , patient amendment experience complete partial remission proteinuria may treat schedule ( six month end previous treatment ) . All patient administer diuretic , antihypertensive drug antiplatelet agent need . Cyclosporin , immunosuppressive drug azathioprine anti-inflammatory drug allow . ACE-inhibitors angiotensin II receptor antagonist allow treatment hypertension . Given importance blood pressure control slow chronic renal failure progression , target blood pressure 130/80 mmHg warrant . Treatment allocation Similarly original protocol , patient randomly allocate one two treatment group ( steroid alone steroid plus azathioprine ) . A 48-month recruitment period estimate . Trial procedure Patients consider eligible basis inclusion/exclusion criterion provide information concern study ask informed consent . Patients examine baseline , every month first six month , every two month 6th 12th month every three month thereafter . At visit , patient ask clinical symptom , possible treatment complication drug consumption . Their body weight , blood pressure , plasma creatinine level , hemocrome leukocyte platelet count , total plasma protein , serum glucose , AST , ALT , GGT , bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , 24-hour urinary protein excretion also measure record . Histological evaluation Given renal biopsy require recent , histological lesion could reflect actual state disease time randomisation . For reason , histological evaluation perform patient . Statistical analysis The result trial evaluate intention-to-treat analysis . The primary endpoint progression renal disease , estimate basis 50 % increase baseline plasma creatinine level . The double plasma creatinine baseline also consider primary end-point . Secondary end-points evolution proteinuria time ( complete partial remission respectively define proteinuria &lt; 0.2 g/24h halve baseline proteinuria ) , number relapse ( define proteinuria equal high baseline ) number type adverse event two group assess every month first six month , every two month 6th 12th month every three month thereafter . Renal survival without endpoint analyse mean Kaplan-Meier method two group compare use log-rank Breslow test . Multivariate analysis base Cox 's regression proportional hazard model use estimate relative risk associate possible prognostic factor sex , age , plasma creatinine level , proteinuria , arterial hypertension , macroscopic hematuria , ACE-inhibitors , angiotensin II receptor antagonist . The minimum length follow five year .</detailed_description>
