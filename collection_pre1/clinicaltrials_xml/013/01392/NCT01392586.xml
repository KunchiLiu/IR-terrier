	<brief_title>Systemic Therapy With Without Upfront Surgery Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Netherlands approximately one eight woman diagnose breast cancer ; 5 % metastatic disease presentation . Because metastatic breast cancer consider incurable disease , treat palliative intent . Recent retrospective study demonstrate ( complete ) resection primary tumor significantly improve outcome patient primary metastatic breast cancer . However , study show survival benefit patient underwent surgery cause selection bias . SUBMIT clinical trial intend answer question whether front breast surgery patient primary distant metastatic breast cancer result improvement 2-year survival compare survival achieve systemic therapy delay local treatment systemic therapy alone . Patients submit study patient primary distant metastatic breast cancer , prior treatment breast cancer , 18 year old fit enough undergo surgery systemic therapy . Exclusion criterion : history breast cancer , malignancy within last 10 year , surgical treatment radiotherapy breast tumor randomization , irresectable T4 tumor synchronous bilateral breastcancer . Randomization take place immediately diagnosis primary distant metastatic breast cancer . Patients either randomize front surgery breast tumor ( UFS ) follow systemic therapy systemic therapy ( ST ) potentially follow delayed local treatment breast tumor . The primary endpoint trial 2-years survival . Quality life one important secondary endpoint .</detailed_description>
