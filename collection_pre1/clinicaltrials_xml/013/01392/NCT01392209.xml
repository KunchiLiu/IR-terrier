	<criteria>Patients must EITHER Histologically confirm intracranial malignant glioma follow type : Glioblastoma , Anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , Anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( AO ) , Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma ( AOA ) also call anaplastic mixed glioma , Malignant glioma NOS ( otherwise specify ) . Patients eligible original histology lowgrade glioma subsequent histological diagnosis high grade ( malignant ) glioma make . OR Histologically confirm low grade ( WHO grade II ) glioma ( low grade astrocytoma , low grade oligodendroglioma , low grade oligoastrocytoma ( mixed glioma ) , low grade glioma NOS ) IF radiographic evidence MRI malignant transformation histologic confirmation high grade ( malignant ) transformation would otherwise undertaken routine clinical care . Inclusion patient group allow increase accrual rapidity enrol patient otherwise ineligible almost malignant glioma trial yet treat presumptively malignant glioma . The primary aim phase I study determination efficacy . Therefore , inclusion patient affect efficacy analysis . Participating site confirmation adequate . Able undergo brain MRI scan . MRI scan gadolinium contrast show geographicallycircumscribed tumor ≤40 cc incorporate enhance nonenhancing volume . This calculated product maximum measurement 3 dimension divide 2 . Tumors exceed limit may eligible question direct Radiation Oncology Investigator MSK PI . ( The MRI must perform steroid dosage stable decrease least 5 day . Patients steroid eligible . If steroid dose increase date imaging registration , new baseline MRI require ) . Prior treatment approximately 60 Gy radiotherapy .
