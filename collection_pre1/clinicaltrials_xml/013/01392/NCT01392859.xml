	<brief_summary>Asthma , chronic disease produce significant morbidity mortality child , significant health problem large segment society . Despite considerable advance diagnosis treatment asthma past several year , sizeable portion patient respond `` core '' treatment . The investigator learn underlie pathophysiology disease different among patient asthma therefore ; treatment beneficial patient group may achieve affect group . Antihistamines study past treatment asthma . These study show may beneficial effect antihistamine patient allergic asthma histamine likely play large role disease treatment response . However , enough evidence include drug standard treatment asthma . The investigator hypothesize histamine play definable , significant role disease pathogenesis treatment response child allergic asthma . The investigator plan test overall hypothesis two specific aim . The first aim characterize relative contribution histamine allergic vs. non-allergic asthma . This aim accomplish comparison microvasculature response histamine child allergic asthma child non-allergic asthma , measure histamine iontophoresis laser Doppler ( HILD ) monitoring , determine potential phenotype-associated difference pharmacodynamic response histamine . The investigator also investigate role genetic variation observe difference HILD two group . The second aim characterize pharmacodynamic response antihistamine via HILD child exaggerate histamine response compare child low histamine response . This aim accomplish conduct randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over trial levocetirizine ( LCT ) two group ( high histamine low histamine ) observe difference antihistamine pharmacodynamics two group . The investigator also investigate effect pharmacokinetic variation genetic variation histamine pathway observe pharmacodynamic drug response .</brief_summary>
