	<brief_title>pCLE For Diagnosis Of Cancer Unknown Bile Duct Stricture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial aim evaluate performance diagnosis pCLE detection bile duct cancer , patient indeterminate biliary stricture associate diagnostic information . The hypothesis ERCP Cellvizio probe-based endomicroscopy improve differentiation biliary pancreatic duct lesion versus ERCP alone ERCP tissue sampling , improve sensitivity detection provide real-time diagnosis . Direct measure accuracy ( sensitivity , specificity , etc . ) differentiation malignant versus benign biliary duct lesion compare combination ERCP alone , endomicroscopy plus ERCP imaging , ERCP plus endomicroscopy plus tissue sampling . These information review retrospectively second physician . These presumptive diagnosis compare 12-month follow-up confirm histopathologic endpoint ( initially-benign pathologic diagnosis confirm 12-month follow-up ) . Secondary objective include collect patient management recommendation . Yet , effective management recommendation leave discretion physician .</detailed_description>
