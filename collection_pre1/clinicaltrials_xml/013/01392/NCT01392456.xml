	<brief_summary>The aim study : 1 . To validate Romanian translation OHIP-EDENT ( Oral Health Impact Profile Edentulous Adults ) , short form OHIP ( Oral Health Impact Profile ) develop Allen Locker edentulous adult . The OHIP questionnaire efficient instrument assessment OHRQoL - Oral Health-Related Quality Life . 2 . To compare satisfaction 69 fully mandibular edentulous patient rehabilitate implant-supported overdentures three different type retention : Retentive Anchors , Magnets , Locator .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Cross-Cultural Adaptation Romanian Version Oral Health Impact Profile Edentulous Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fully edentulism substantially affect oral general health well overall quality life inappropriate treatment use classical prosthesis may impair buccal function , increase alveolar bone loss also often unsatisfactory patient . Implant-retained denture provide successful long-term outcome , particularly use rehabilitate edentulous mandible ( Assad et al . 2004 ; Chan et al . 1995 ; Davis et al . 1999 ) . Results achievable prosthesis well know : degree stability , chew efficiency , ultimately patient satisfaction exceed benefit obtain conventional denture treatment . However study address perception treatment outcomes patient critically important determine whether meaningful difference base type retention use ( Retentive Anchors , Magnets , Locator ) . OHIP-EDENT ( Oral Health Impact Profile Edentulous Adults ) , short form ( 19 item ) OHIP ( Oral Health Impact Profile ) detect impact oral health quality life patient wear total prosthesis include question address masticatory capacity , pleasure eating , level comfort relationship problem . This questionnaire validate several language still available Romanian . Material method 1 . Linguistic cultural adaptation : Because OHIP EDENT previously use Romania , pilot assess face content validity within target population . The OHIP EDENT linguistically culturally adapt set use back translation technique ( accord guideline provide Beaton et al . 2000 ) order maintain cross-cultural equivalence . In procedure , translation independently make two bilingual person , discuss produce consensus Romanian version ( T1 T2 produce T12 ) , translate back English two professional English translator ( one native English ) never see original version ( BT1 BT2 version ) . The conceptual equivalence original instrument back-translated version support expert committee ( form 3 researcher : methodologist , two expert quality life study , four translator ) . The definitive Romanian version produce face content validity result pilot study approve committee . 2 . Pilot study : Ethical approval specific write consent obtain relevant authority pilot study start . The pilot study conduct convenience sample ( n=35 ) obtain mandibular edentulous patient come Dental School , University Medicine Pharmacy Bucharest , Romania Concordia Dent Clinic , Bucharest . Participants clinically examine accord WHO ( World Health Organization ) methodology complete pilot OHIP EDENT . The comprehensiveness instrument test ask difficulty understand item frequency , order optimize face content validity main study . Reproducibility evaluate measure test - retest reliability . Test-retest reliability calculate use intraclass correlation coefficient ( ICC ) . The sample 35 respondent fully edentulous interview two week first interview . 3 . Main Study : Patient satisfaction assess aid OHIP-EDENT questionnaire validate initial ( original denture ) , 6 month 1 , 3 , 5 year post overdenture insertion .</detailed_description>
