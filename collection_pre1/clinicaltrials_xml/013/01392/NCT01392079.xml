	<brief_title>Subcutaneous Alemtuzumab Combined With Oral Dexamethasone , Followed Alemtuzumab Maintenance Allo-SCT CLL With 17p- Refractory Fludarabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CLL refractory therapy base fludarabine 17p deletion poor prognosis . Patients F-refractory CLL remission rate 20 % various salvage regimens median overall survival ( OS ) &lt; 12 month ( Keating et al. , 2002a ) . CLL patient 17p deletion median OS 16 month first-line treatment fludarabine FC CLL4 trial GCLLSG ( Figure 2 ; Stilgenbauer et al. , 2005b ; Eichhorst et al. , 2006 ) . Alemtuzumab active single agent fludarabine-refractory CLL , remission rate 30-40 % median OS 16-28 month ( Keating et al. , 2002b , Rai et al. , 2002 ) . Furthermore , alemtuzumab proven efficacy CLL 17p deletion subcutaneous administration effective intravenous application ( Stilgenbauer &amp; Döhner , 2002 , Lozanski et al. , 2004 , Stilgenbauer et al. , 2004 ) . However , outcome fludarabine-refractory CLL still poor , owe fact majority patient achieve remission average duration remission short . Therefore , current trial aim achieve : ( ) high remission rate , add high-dose dexamethasone alemtuzumab , ( ii ) prolongation remission duration survival alemtuzumab maintenance allogeneic stem-cell transplantation ( SCT ) . High-dose steroid show activity independently 17p p53 status , effective debulking large lymph node , weakness alemtuzumab ( Bellosillo et al. , 2002 , Thornton et al. , 2003 , Pettitt et al. , 2006 ) . Maintenance treatment alemtuzumab improve remission duration CLL4B trial allogeneic SCT result disease control high-risk CLL CLL3X trial ( Wendtner et al. , 2004 , Dreger et al. , 2005 ) . This prospective , open , multi-center Phase II study conduct Deutsche CLL Studiengruppe ( DCLLSG ; German CLL Study Group , GCLLSG ) . There one treatment group thus randomization . The study conduct approximately 40 investigation site Germany , Austria France . The study conduct accord EG Directive Good Clinical Practice , German Arzneimittelgesetz ( AMG , 12 . Novelle ) well - respect local activity regulation - correspond law France Austria . A total 122 patient ( adult , male female , in-patients out-patients ; 2 10 patient expect recruited center ) recruit , stratification detail diagnosis . The distribution female male patient relevant study sex affect CLL treatment effect different group ( GCP-V § 7 , 2 ) . Recruiting stop 122th . patient complete first four-week cycle treatment . The study conclude last patient complete treatment alemtuzumab accord protocol . The retrieval additional follow-up data may appropriate achieve mature data survival endpoint . Subcutaneous alemtuzumab ( 30 mg ) administer three time weekly ( day 1 , 3 5 ) along oral dexamethasone ( 40 mg/day , day 1-4 , every 2 week ) least 4 week ( correspond 12 dos alemtuzumab , case treatment interruption may take long 4 week ) , patient show least SD , maximum 12 week ( 36 dos alemtuzumab , case treatment interruption may take long 12 week ) . Thereafter , maintenance therapy alemtuzumab institute maximum two year . If CR ( include bone marrow histology imaging ( chest X-ray ultrasound , CT indicate ) document week 12 , i.e . week 4 ( 12 dose 30 mg alemtuzumab ) 8 ( 24 dose 30 mg alemtuzumab ) , maintenance treatment alemtuzumab instituted time point . In study recommend start dose alemtuzumab directly 30 mg . However , dose alemtuzumab increase gradually ( 3 mg day -2 , 10 mg day -1 30 mg day 1 , early study ) , accord investigator discretion . Staging perform inclusion study 12 dos alemtuzumab ( aim : end Week 4 ) , 24 dos alemtuzumab ( aim : end Week 8 ) , 36 dos alemtuzumab ( aim : end Week 12 ) treatment . Patients show progressive disease ( PD ) ( accord NCI criterion ) withdrawn study . If hematological toxicity see , treatment interrupt dose reduce accord prescription information . If 12 week stable disease ( SD ) , partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) , maintenance treatment give , continue subcutaneous alemtuzumab ( 30 mg every 14 day ) . Patients stem-cell transplantation realistic treatment option offer possibility receive allogeneic stem-cell treatment another clinical trial ( CLLX2 GCLLSG trial ) . The latter however offer ( 1 ) patient eligible accord protocol ( 2 ) HLA-compatible donor available give his/her inform consent . There treatment-free period least 2 month SCT , detail specify correspond protocol . Appropriate premedication infection prophylaxis administer . After disease staging ( i.e . every three month maintenance phase ) , SD , PR CR , patient continue study therapy ( alemtuzumab maintenance ) . Maintenance therapy stop two year . During study , continual monitoring efficacy toxicity perform . Early stopping rule apply major intolerability observe . Response assess clinical examination , blood count , clinical chemistry , chest X-ray ( plain radiograph chest ) , ultrasound abdomen , CT scan ( indicate ) , bone marrow cytology histology ( case possible CR ) , assessment MRD ( molecular response rate ) . Time point response evaluation accord NCI criterion 12 dos , 24 dos , 36 dos alemtuzumab . For uninterrupted treatment course , 4 , 8 12 week respectively . ( If treatment alemtuzumab interrupt , time point subsequent dos , assessment procedure delay correspondingly ; i.e. , number dos determine factor elapse treatment time , calendar date ; see , `` Staging perform ... '' . ) Follow-up assessment continue three-month interval least three year . The following time schedule anticipate study : - Start recruitment : January 2008 - End recruitment : September 2011 - End study procedure ( conclusion maintenance therapy ) : December 2013 ( plus eventual additional follow-up )</detailed_description>
