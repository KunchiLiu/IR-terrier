	<brief_summary>The technique transplant progenitor cell region damage myocardium , term cellular cardiomyoplasty1 , potentially new therapeutic modality design replace repair necrotic , scar , dysfunctional myocardium2-4 . Ideally , graft cell readily available , easy culture ensure adequate quantity transplantation , able survive host myocardium ; often hostile environment limit blood supply immunorejection . Whether effective cellular regenerative strategy require administered cell differentiate adult cardiomyocytes couple electromechanically surround myocardium increasingly controversial recent evidence suggest may require effective cardiac repair . Most importantly , transplantation graft cell improve cardiac function prevent adverse ventricular remodel . To date , number candidate cell transplant experimental model , include fetal neonatal cardiomyocytes5 , embryonic stem cell-derived myocytes6 , 7 , tissue engineer contractile grafts8 , skeletal myoblasts9 , several cell type derive adult bone marrow10-15 , cardiac precursor reside within heart itself16 . There substantial clinical development use whole bone marrow skeletal myoblast preparation study enrol post-infarction patient , patient chronic ischemic leave ventricular dysfunction heart failure . The effect bone-marrow derive mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) also study clinically . Currently , bone marrow bone marrow-derived cell represent highly promising modality cardiac repair . The totality evidence trial investigate autologous whole bone marrow infusion patient follow myocardial infarction support safety approach . In term efficacy , increase ejection fraction report majority trial . Non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy common problematic condition ; definitive therapy form heart transplantation available tiny minority eligible patient . Cellular cardiomyoplasty chronic heart failure study less acute MI , represent potentially important alternative disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Pilot Study , intend safety assessment prior full comparator study . In Pilot Study , cell administer via Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA injection catheter system test 36 patient two group : Group 1 ( 18 patient ) Eighteen ( 18 ) patient treat Auto-hMSCs : 20 million cells/ml deliver dose 0.5 ml per injection x 10 injection total 1 X 108 ( 100 million ) Auto-hMSCs . Group 2 ( 18 patient ) Eighteen ( 18 ) patient treat Allo-hMSCs : 20 million cells/ml deliver dose 0.5 ml per injection x 10 injection total 1 X 108 ( 100 million ) Auto-hMSCs . The first three ( 3 ) patient group ( Group 1 Group 2 ) treat less 5 day apart undergo full evaluation 5 day demonstrate evidence procedure induce myocardial infarction myocardial perforation prior proceed treatment patient . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio one two group . Treatment Strategies : Autologous hMSCs vs. Allogeneic hMSCs . The Study Team record maintain detailed record injection location . If patient randomize Groups 1 ( Auto-hMSCs ) Auto-hMSCs expand require dose 1 X 108 cell , injection contain maximum number cell available . The injection administer transendocardially cardiac catheterization use Biosense Webster MyoStar NOGA Catheter System . For patient randomize Group 1 ( Auto-hMSCs ) ; cell derive sample patient 's bone marrow ( obtain iliac crest aspiration ) approximately 4-6 week prior cardiac catheterization . For patient randomize Group 2 ( Allo- hMSCs ) , cell supply allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cell source manufacture University Miami . The Allo-hMSCs patient group 2 administer baseline assessment complete expected range 2 - 4 week post-randomization . Following cardiac catheterization cell injection , patient hospitalize minimum 2 day follow 2 week post-catheterization , month 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 complete safety efficacy assessment .</detailed_description>
