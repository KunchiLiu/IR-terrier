	<brief_summary>Antibody titer tick-borne encephalitis ( TBE ) vaccination less elderly vaccination breakthrough common age group . This prompt Swedish authority recommend additional dose initial vaccination schedule ( = 0+30+90 day instead usually recommend 0+30 day . The investigator intend evaluate regime .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The risk TBE increase Sweden . Together increase awareness possibility acquire protection vaccination , lead increase number dose vaccine distribute Sweden year -now approximately 400.000 . The first year , two dos interval 1 month recommend general population , follow third dose approximately one year later additional booster dose three year third . Recent study show antibody titer TBE substantially less old population . This line present recommendation Austria booster interval shorten 3 year age group 60+ . It also line report vaccination failures 13/27 patient old 60 year According study Jilkowa et al , 18 % ( 38/185 ) age group 60+ achieve putative level antibody titer first two dos . Therefore , manufacturer Encepur recommend total three dos age group use regimen `` accelerated vaccination schedule ( 0+7+21 day ) . Unfortunately , GMT ( geometrical mean titer ) 3 dos accelerate schedule superior 2 dos give 0+30 day . The manufacturer FSME-immun instead recommend serology check one month second dose third dose give titer sufficient ( 0+30+60 day ) . Unfortunately , determination titer large number sample put severe strain logistics feasible Sweden . In order try improve immunity age group 60+ , Department Communicable Disease Control Prevention Stockholm therefore recommend third dose two month first two dos age group 60+ ( 0+30+60 day ) . Study design . The investigator intend give FSME-immune 3 group vary vaccination schedule ( 0+7+21 , 0+30 0+30+90 . 50 participant randomize group . Half 50-59 year half least 60 year old . A young age group ( 50 participant 18-49 year ) serve control give FSME-immune accord standard recommendation ( 0+30 day ) . Serum sample ( 10 ml blood ) obtain five time : 0,60,120,360 400 day first dose Samples analyse neutralise antibody Swedish institute Infectious disease control - option possible .</detailed_description>
