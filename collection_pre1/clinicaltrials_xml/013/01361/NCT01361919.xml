	<brief_summary>The goal study compare three method teach medical nursing student basic life save skill . The standard method teach student push chest analyze heart rhythm use regular monitor . The new approach teach skill use special heart monitor provide visual verbal reminder . The third approach combine standard newer approach teach . Our study would like find good way teach skill create standard way grade well student perform . This study measure deep fast student push manikin 's chest certain amount time . Other goal include measure well student use heart monitor deliver shock analyze heart rhythm , many breath per minute give , long hand manikin well think perform overall .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Three Different Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation ( CPR ) Training Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The survival rate out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OCA ) remain low ( approximately 5 % ) , despite recent advance advance cardiac life support ( ACLS ) expansion emergency medical service ( EMS ) across Ontario Canada . Although survival rate in-hospital cardiac arrest high , less 20 % ultimately survive discharge . One important determinant survival cardiac arrest appear initiation early effective chest compression . Yet quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) basic life support ( BLS ) deliver first responder often poor . CPR appear deliver inconsistently , incompletely undue delay in-hospital out-of-hospital setting . In effort improve cardiac arrest outcome , focus recently shift method train CPR . Optimal BLS ( involve chest compression , artificial ventilation , use automate external defibrillator available ) difficult perform well , teach , retain high skill level . Most BLS training program use hands-on instruction , printed material , global assessment evaluation , date show impact quality CPR/BLS provide . Guidelines BLS change substantially since 2005 , efficacy teach program aim layperson primary provider emergency care unknown . A potential result limitation teaching , training , evaluation , retention BLS skills CPR continue poorly perform trained lay rescuer professional caregiver . New technology incorporate commercially available defibrillator may help train evaluation BLS skill . These device allow measurement chest compression depth rate ventilation frequency continuous real-time feedback provide caregiver mean on-screen icon , simple visual measure integrate CPR efficacy , well verbal prompt encourage best performance . Electronic information store defibrillator subsequent off-line analysis use provide additional visual feedback . Perhaps importantly , tool provide quantitative measure quality resuscitation effort integrate various aspect CPR performance . To date clinical study assess tool would facilitate training test CPR skill use new 2005 cardiac arrest guideline . To answer question , investigator propose conduct clinical trial involve medical nursing student ( consider `` lay rescuer '' ) , randomize three different teach strategy . The advantage population relatively easy access addition , provide homogeneous population similarity background , education , motivation personal expectation . They also represent large proportion individual , time , expose respond in-hospital cardiac arrest . By use medical nursing student still formative stage concepts allied health member , investigator hope provide opportunity work , . The control group receive standard teaching BLS accord ILCOR 2005 Guidelines , include appropriate chest compression rate , depth , chest recoil minimization `` hands-off '' time , appropriate ventilation , use standard defibrillator ( Zoll M series ) . The first intervention group receive training supplement use novel defibrillator ( Zoll R Series ) allow real-time continuous feedback visual audio prompt optimize CPR performance , well additional off-line review detail chest compression ( include rate depth ) , `` hands-off '' time ( time spend chest compression ) , therapy sequencing . The second intervention group receive training novel defibrillator ( Zoll R Series ) test standard defibrillator ( Zoll M series ) . Two hundred forty consent student randomly assign standard training ( `` control '' ) group , train test use advanced feedback feature ( `` intervention group 1 '' ) , train use advanced feedback feature test use standard defibrillator ( `` intervention group 2 '' ) , group 2 . After two hour training period participant test approximately 5 minute . Students control intervention group randomize three group : R-Series , R series M series M-Series defibrillator test use scenario similar training session . The primary outcome total CPR fraction ( percentage time chest compression scenario ) . Secondary outcome CPR fraction per minute , average rate compression per minute , total record hands-off time , average depth compression , average integrate `` icon fullness '' approximation cardiac output . Overall performance term integrate psychomotor skill , reason hands-off time , appropriate versus inappropriate use AED term rhythm analysis , shock delivery study participant self-assessment performance also measure . After 3 month period , student re-tested use test scenario ass skill retention . No BLS training give prior retesting . This first study evaluate objectively controlled manner usefulness new technology teach , learn evaluation CPR/BLS .</detailed_description>
