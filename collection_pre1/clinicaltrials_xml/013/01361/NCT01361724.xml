	<brief_summary>Problems balance walk affect mobility inevitable cause decrease quality life old people chronic neurologic condition Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Although evidence exercise improve mobility elderly , investigator n't know : 1 ) What best mode exercise intervention delivery ( i.e . individual therapy clinic , home exercise program , group class ) ? 2 ) problem common people PD and/or elderly affect outcome ? Although physical therapy carry individually , group home program would cost-effective investigator need know effective . Since old people chronic neurologic disease also problem affect mental function , muscle joint and/or pain , important understand problem affect success therapy . The purpose study investigate PT intervention deliver patient chronic neurologic disease also problem . The investigator use elderly people PD one co-morbidities associate PD and/or age . Sixty people PD co-morbidities randomize 1of 3 group ; home program , individual PT group exercise class . Each 3 group lead PT provide novel sensory-motor agility program develop laboratory . All group perform type exercise 3 X/week 4 week . Improvement Physical Performance Test disability use determine success therapy . To determine mobility improve therapy , change gait , balance , quality life measure . Gait balance measure new , wearable motion sensor ( iPOD size ) stand chair , walking , turn around sit back . The finding study help guide rehabilitation treatment complex , chronic problem affect mobility old people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Effectiveness Physical Therapy chronic neurologic disease ; role co-morbidities delivery PT service . Despite frequent referral people chronic neurologic disease outpatient physical therapy ( PT ) service , relative effectiveness various type PT delivery population uncertain . The investigator encourage data support effectiveness customize , evidence-based agility exercise program patient 's Parkinson 's disease wonder whether less expensive mode delivery PT service , group program independent , home exercise program could effective individualize , one-on-one treatment physical therapist . Traditional study exercise patient chronic neurologic disease also tend exclude subject co-morbidities , common complex , degenerative disease , especially elderly extent presence co-morbidities determine success PT service also unknown . This proposal use randomize , intervention study evaluate three mode PT delivery agility exercise program improve mobility people longstanding PD also least one significant co-morbidities . This study help determine optimal referral pattern PT service patient complex , chronic problem affect mobility . Aim 1 . To determine effect differ mode delivery PT service mobility disability , gait balance people chronic neurologic disease . The investigator examine change disability well gait balance performance measure 4 week exercise perform 3 time per week 1 ) home exercise program provide PT , 2 ) group PT-led exercise program , 3 ) individual program . The primary outcome Physical Performance Test disability . Secondary outcome measure provide information process underlying effectiveness : instrument Timed go test PDQ-39 perceive mobility , mood , cognitive deficit . The investigator also compare adverse event number exercise session subject miss complication exercise program well compliance , number PD subject drop maintain 12-session , exercise program . Aim 2 . To determine specific PD-related age-related co-morbidities influence effectiveness different type PT delivery . The investigator categorize co-morbidities directly relate PD , include mental ( depression , cognition ) , balance ( falls fracture ) autonomic ( orthostatic hypotension ) relate age ( peripheral neuropathy , pain muscle weakness ) . The investigator determine number type co-morbidities influence outcome exercise program . This project great clinical significance rehabilitation elderly people chronic , complex neurologic disease . The information study influence best approach physical therapy service improve mobility patient complex problem affect balance gait .</detailed_description>
