	<brief_summary>The primary objective study conduct magnetic resonance spectroscopic ( MRS ) imaging ( MRI ) scan assess structural neurochemical profile brain 20 child adolescent , 6-17 year old Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) . For comparison , MRS MRI also obtain 10 healthy control subject , match 20 subject ASD age , sex , dexterity , IQ . All eligible subject administer detailed assessment battery consist cognitive assessment ( neuropsychological battery include subset DANVA2 CANTAB ) measure psychosocial functioning ( SAICA M-FES ) . The study include 1-3 visit screen period Massachusetts General Hospital ( approximately 4 hour assessment ) one scan visit McLean Hospital ( approximately 1.5 hour ) . The investigator hypothesize youth ASD versus control exhibit increased glutamate concentration , reflect glutamatergic overactivity , increase Cho concentration , suggest neuronal abnormality . Furthermore , investigator hypothesize compare neurotypical control , structural integrity white mater tract disrupt ASD .</brief_summary>
