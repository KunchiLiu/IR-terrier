	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Analgesic Effect IV Administration Kappa Agonist CR845 For Hysterectomy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , widely use drug treat pain surgery opiates , morphine . Morphine work mainly activate one several type opiate receptor control pain sensation - so-called mu opiate receptor . These receptor locate many area brain also outside brain . By activate receptor , morphine provide significant pain relief , also cause side effect limit use . Some side effect include : respiratory depression arrest ( slow stop breathe ) , sedation ( state calmness extreme relaxation ) , euphoria ( exaggerated feeling physical mental well-being ) , constipation , nausea , vomit , drug addiction . In order avoid side effect morphine mu opiate , present experimental drug CR845 design work different type opiate receptor - call kappa - also provide pain relief , act sensory nerve outside brain . CR845 design penetrate brain much less opiate drug , result pain relief similar morphine , few side effect . Because CR845 activate kappa receptor instead mu receptor , side effect different morphine-type drug . In particular , kappa opiate , CR845 , cause respiratory depression arrest , euphoria , constipation , drug tolerance , physical drug dependence drug addiction . For reason , CR845 may present distinct advantage opiates currently use pain relief post-operative pain particular .</detailed_description>
