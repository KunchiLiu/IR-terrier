	<detailed_description>This study enroll adult de novo Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) patient ( ≥18 year , ≤60 year ) . Induction treatment consist 12 week Dasatinib oral administration ( 140 mg QD ) . Patients initiate treatment steroid 7 day prior start Dasatinib continue day 31 . Patients continue treatment Dasatinib day 84 , except disease progression , intolerable toxicity , withdrawal study . Thereafter : - patient hematological molecular CR receive post-remissional treatment consist Dasatinib alone 6 month period - patient hematological CR persistence molecular disease allografted , eligible donor available , treat 2 cycle Clofarabine-Cyclophosphamide schedule . After allograft : - MRD negative patient ( i.e . CHR PCR negative ) receive 6 month Dasatinib maintenance treatment ; - MRD positive patient ( i.e . CHR PCR positive ) receive Dasatinib maintenance treatment relapse progression . Patients transplant treated Clofarabine/Cyclophosphamide also receive Dasatinib maintenance treatment relapse progression .</detailed_description>
