	<brief_summary>Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS ) chronic painful progressive inflammatory arthritis unknown etiology primarily affect spine sacroiliac joint . In addition formation new bone lead syndesmophytes ankylosis ; osteoporosis also prominent feature AS-thus show paradox new bone formation abnormal site coexist reduce bone mass &amp; increased fracture risk . Osteoporosis common complication AS , incidence 18.7 % 62 % . TNF alpha central role disturb balance bone metabolism -- result accelerated alveolar bone loss decrease strength- i.e . osteoporosis . The investigator hypothesis anti TNF therapy effective active AS resistant conventional therapy help improve bone density bone health .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Of Anti TNF Alpha Therapy And Their Adverse Effects In Ankylosing Spondylitis In A North Indian Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ankylosing spondylitis respond conventional therapy effectively treat Anti TNF therapy . In addition study show TNF role osteoporosis inflammatory disease . The hypothesis anti TNF therapy may decrease osteoporosis tilt bone metabolism osteoblastic side test study . These studied Indian population . Another great issue usage anti TNF therapy Indian population high incidence develop infective complication ; especially tuberculosis . The investigator thus study north Indian population tertiary centre . The result would come important conclusion regard treatment important issue tuberculosis screen prevention .</detailed_description>
