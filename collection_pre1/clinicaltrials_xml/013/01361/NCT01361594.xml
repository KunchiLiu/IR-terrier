	<brief_summary>High blood glucose level ( hyperglycemia ) cardiac surgery patient diabetes associate increased risk hospital complication . Blood sugar control intravenous insulin may prevent hospital complication . Many patient undergo cardiac bypass surgery ( CABG ) develop high blood sugar require insulin therapy ( shortly surgery ) . It clear best insulin regimen best blood sugar target patient . Accordingly , research study aim determine optimal blood glucose level patient undergo cardiac bypass surgery . Patients divide two group . The intensive insulin group maintain blood glucose 100-140 mg/dl conventional treatment group glucose level 140-180 mg/dl . The insulin use trial ( lantus , aspart regular insulin ) approve use treatment patient diabetes FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) . A total 326 patient high blood glucose cardiac bypass surgery recruit study . Patients recruit Emory University Hospital , Emory Midtown Hospital Grady Memorial Hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several prospective cohort study well randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) cardiac surgery patient show intensified insulin therapy ( target BG : 110-140 mg/dl ) result reduction short- long-term mortality compare conventionally treated patient . The result recent international trial critically ill patient ; however , fail show significant improvement mortality even show increased mortality risk well increase number hypoglycemic event intensive compare less intensive glycemic control . Based result ICU trial , new ADA AACE guideline recommend glycemic target 140 180 mg/dl ICU include cardiac surgery patient . There concern high BG target might increase risk hospital complication cardiac surgical patient intensive glucose control consistently reduce infection , length hospital stay , resource utilization , cardiac-related mortality . The overall objective proposal conduct first prospective RCT determine optimal BG target perioperative period hyperglycemic subject undergo CABG United States . Subjects randomize undergo intensive insulin therapy adjust maintain BG 100 mg/dl 140 mg/dl conventional glucose control target BG 141 mg/dl 200 mg/dl ICU . The central hypothesis proposal intensive insulin management reduce perioperative complication compare conventional BG control cardiac surgery patient .</detailed_description>
