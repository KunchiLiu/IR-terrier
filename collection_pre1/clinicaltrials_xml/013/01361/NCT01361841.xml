	<brief_summary>Intraocular pressure ( IOP ) consider main risk factor progression glaucoma therefore main target therapy . Pharmacologic treatment glaucoma change considerably last decade due introduction prostaglandin analogue . Three commonly use North America : latanoprost ( Latanoprost T , Pfizer ) , Travoprost ( Travatan TM , Alcon ) bimatoprost ( Lumigan TM , Allergan ) . There several study evaluate effectiveness . The three seem equivalent , accord study compare molecule . Latanoprost employ initially , due paucity side effect compare two analogue . However , effective , several study ahve show result possible use either travoprost bimatoprost . No study conduct date systematically compare three molecule case resistance latanoprost . In actuality , investigator patient receive treatment identical current practice exception group continue latanoprost . Several study confirm benefit change prostaglandin analogue first signficantly decrease IOP ( Palmberg et al . 2004 ) . Each prostaglandin unique property may cause mechanism action vary slightly among patient . ( cf . Pharmacological Aspects ) The goal study thus evaluate efficaciousness latanoprost , bimatoprost travoprost IOP-lowering capacity patient initially respond latanoprost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Latanoprost , Bimatoprost Travoprost Patients With Latanoprost-resistant Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research question : What effectiveness latanoprost , bimatoprost travoprost patient whose intraocular pressure decrease least 20 % undergoing treatment latanoprost ? Secondary question : 1- What percentage glaucoma patient resistant latanoprost ? 2- Which prostaglandin effective decrease intraocular pressure case resistance latanoprost ? Research Project Goals : Evaluation effectiveness latanoprost , bimatoprost travoprost patient latanoprost decrease intraocular pressure least 20 % . The effectiveness three prostaglandin determine IOP : treatment least effect 20 % decrease baseline ( IOP measure time recruitment ) , ultimate aim attain target IOP , vary depend patient . Target IOP base severity optic nerve damage well baseline IOP . Determine percentage patient resistant prostaglandin . Patients respond ( measure IOP decrease ) 2 prostaglandin consider resistant category hypotensive medication . Study design : Randomised , open label . Study duration : Approximately two year . POPULATION : The target population consist open angle glaucoma patient , patient ocular hypertension IOP great 21 mmHg never undergone treatment glaucoma . Patients must 18 year old , capable give informed consent write form . Sampling - Candidates select patient population ophthalmology clinic CHUS hotel-Dieu private practice Dr. Blondeau - The patient treat latanoprost approximately 6 week , experience least 20 % decrease initial IOP eligible invite participate study . Sample size - The sample size estimate base need obtain significant decrease baseline IOP 6 week , 2 month 6 month . Estimating maximum IOP variation 2 mmHg standard deviation +/- 2 mmHg , necessary sample size power study ( 90 % p &lt; 0.05 use paired-samples Student T test ) 47 patient per group . Methods randomization sample make-up : The study randomize comparative trial take place period 12 month . Patients distributed random lot 6 ( ACBCAB , etc ) 3 different group document non-response ( IOP decrease le 20 % ) latanoprost . Group 1 remain Latanoprost 0.005 % , Group 2 switch travoprost 0.004 % Group 3 switch bimatoprost 0.03 % . The dose medication 1 drop daily HS , usual dose ophthalmological practice scientific literature . Intraocular pressure measure manner patient applanation tonometry . Thus , study participant : Time IOP measurement IOP value ( mmHg ) At time recruitment 6 week 2 month 6 month * Therefore , 3 group patient measurement take . Stages study : 1 . Patient recruitment : - Diagnosis glaucoma de novo outpatient clinic Dr. Blondeau 's office . - Patients informed possibility resistance treatment 6 week latanoprost , well possible benefit . The patient receive consent form , consist explanation study include potential side effect medication . Patients able take time thoroughly read document decide whether wish participate study . 2 . Consent : - Informed consent obtain ophthalmologist Dr. Pierre Blondeau resident ophthalmology , Zineb Ghali , PGY IV , offer clarification explanation potential participant necessary . 3 . Trial Design : 1 . Patients diagnosis primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) ocular hypertension ( OH ) never receive treatment recruit . 2 . Recruited patient treat 6 week latanoprost . This correspond time necessary molecule block prostaglandin receptor , thus allow maximum IOP-lowering potential . This period time determine pharmaceutical company create molecule use study involve molecule . 3 . Patients experienced decrease least 20 % baseline IOP consent participate distribute 3 different group ( recruitment step ) . Group 1 patient continue receive latanoprost 0.005 % , 1 drop daily HS . The two group receive either bimatoprost 0.03 % travoprost 0.004 % , 1 drop daily HS . Patients continue treat 4 week . Patients receive instruction regard medication administration compliance . The medication administer every 24 hour 20:00 22:00 . No IOP-lowering medication permit . 4 . Patients less 20 % response initial treatment latanoprost randomise 3 group correspond one prostaglandin analogue . IOP remeasured 6 week order evaluate response medication . We consider documented response treatment consist significant decrease IOP measure t-test . If IOP decrease least 20 % 1 month treatment various prostaglandin , patient exclude study , treat another class hypotensive agent , receive standard follow-up . Security measure : The researcher monitor possible side effect potential problem . To effect , auxiliary researcher ( yet recruit ) well resident ophthalmology ( Zineb Ghali ) available 24 hour day address medication side effect unexpected symptom . If immediate follow-up required patient make contact business hour , research team immediately see patient . If patient contact auxiliary researcher resident outside business hour , immediately refer one ophthalmology resident call hotel Dieu hospital Emergency Department . If necessary , one two physician researcher available meet patient question . This ensure adverse reaction rapidly treat research team . If physician observe undesirable side effect attributable medication , duty discontinue treatment well subject 's participation study . In case , physician ensure continuity care via another form treatment order ensure patient 's recovery . Principal dependent variable : Intraocular pressure shall measure Goldmann tonometer . A drop fluorescein sodium benoxinate hydrochloride , USP ( 0.25 % /0.4 % ) instill patient 's eye , baseline IOP measure Goldmann tonometry . The inter-measurement variability +/- 2mmHg . Secondary variable : - Patient age : quantitative - Patient sex : qualitative - Patient race : qualitative - Side effect 4- Results analysis Homogeneity group term social demographic verify via one-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) Turkey 's correction continuous variable chi-square Fisher 's exact test categorical variable . Values discover significant express follow format : obtain value well confidence interval , order highlight impact particular treatment Two-way cross ANOVA use compare data collect follow-up different ophthalmological exam , notably IOP . We calculate impact period follow-up . The incidence individual side effect summarize compare chi-square test . Emphasis place degree severity symptom cause medication use . The examined side effect occur frequently ocular nature . There interim analysis include research project . All statistical test consider p-value le 0.05 statistically significant , i.e . result consider statistically significant 5 % level .</detailed_description>
