	<brief_summary>The overall purpose randomize trial develop evaluate systematic approach improve African-American parental behavior specifically regard infant sleep environment . African-American parent newborn , healthy term infant randomize receive either standard message avoid bedsharing , eliminate use soft bedding soft sleep surface , place infant supine position sleep reduce risk SIDS enhance message avoid behavior reduce risk SIDS prevent infant suffocation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A persistent , significant racial disparity exist infant mortality rate attributable Sudden Infant Death Syndrome ( SIDS ) type sleep-related sudden unexpected infant death ( SUID ) , suffocation undetermined cause death . SIDS sleep-related death account ~4600 U.S. death annually.4 While incidence SIDS decline , infant death accidental suffocation strangulation bed quadrupled.5 Additionally , racial disparity SIDS sleep-related death increase past decade , African-American infant twice likely die infants.6 , 7 Certain infant sleeping practice , prone ( stomach ) sleeping , use soft bedding soft sleep surface , bedsharing , likely play significant role , SIDS SUID , disparities see therein . Elimination health barrier racial/ethnic disparity , promote healthy development , highlight MCHB research priority ; application directly responsive priority . In current system , health care provider public health message , use American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) recommendations,8 stress use supine ( back ) positioning , avoidance soft bedding , room share without bedsharing recommendation reduce risk SIDS . However , research suggest African-Americans problem message , low degree self-efficacy regard SIDS risk reduction ( i.e. , believe action make difference whether SIDS occur ) suspicious concept `` risk reduction . `` 2 However , African-American parent high degree self-efficacy regard prevent infant suffocation . Given increase number suffocation preventable sleep-related death fact many behavioral risk factor SIDS preventable sleep-related death , provide parent additional safe sleep message emphasize prevention suffocation may effective change parent behavior . Such message would carefully craft base current community-based research1-3 address emerge risk great concern potential self-efficacy . A simple , easily reproducible change system newborn care could thus address critical barrier progress reduce infant mortality rate , particularly among African American family . The best system care reduce disparity must use best available culturally competent message base strong empirical evidence require rigorous evaluation .</detailed_description>
