	<detailed_description>Current rehabilitation assessment technique make difficult monitor day day change patient functional ability . In ideal setting , one would like able observe subtle change way therapy deliver affect manner time take patient learn adaptation necessary recover lose function . To end , investigator seek apply paradigm use study motor learn upper extremity ( FFAP ) Lokomat gait orthosis platform . Over last decade FFAP use elucidate mechanism process contribute motor learn upper extremity . The broad acceptance paradigm within motor control community set precedent application lower extremity use clinical environment . Implementation FFAP Lokomat system allow motor learn assess low extremity motor task . Such tool could use systemically assess effectiveness different aspect therapy , effect train session duration , number exercise repetition , inter-trial ( inter-session ) interval , magnitude perturbation . In initial pilot , investigator seek apply Lokomat implementation FFAP healthy adult subject order understand feasibility approach form database healthy subject learn rate . This initial step allow u bridge scientific gap lower extremity upper limb motor learn research , yield data serve basis comparison future study patient . Additionally , methodology would suggest new avenue research low limb motor learn create increase understanding motor principle govern spectrum human movement . Ultimately , understand fundamental motor learn principle drive neurorehabilitation investigator well understand make rehabilitation successful attempt well improve current rehabilitation protocol . Before test session begin , subject place within Lokomat secure subject trunk , pelvis , low extremity use adjustable cuff Velcro strap , hip knee joint align Lokomat . Each test session begin walk approximately 5 minute standard clinical mode operation . Optional use body weight support foot strap use ensure subject walk comfortably within Lokomat . Clinical mode allow subject walk Lokomat along predefined trajectory pace treadmill match robotic leg . After subject acclimate Lokomat walking , motor learn experiment begin . The format motor learn experiment follow : - `` Free-run mode '' - Subject walk normally possible within Lokomat , Lokomat compensate weight , restrict subject 's movement . Subject 's walking pattern record baseline movement experiment . - Force field mode- Subject experience small force perturbation Lokomat . These force perpendicular path ( move foot upward ) , velocity dependent , occur primarily swing phase ( velocity great ) . These force able slightly alter subject 's walking trajectory . This generate error drive motor learn system cause adaptation , take form compensatory force equal opposite force field . It important note force outside standard Lokomat safety range experience subject since standard safety limit clinical use remain present device . - Error clamp mode- Similar clinical mode , subject limit walk along predefined trajectory , error clamp mode , subject require walk along average baseline trajectory ( record Free-run mode ) , speed choose . Error clamp trial intersperse force field trial , use measure adaptive compensatory force . Any force use move subject along path instead compensatory force reflect subject 's adaptation . These force measure throughout experiment use infer subject ' rate learning .</detailed_description>
