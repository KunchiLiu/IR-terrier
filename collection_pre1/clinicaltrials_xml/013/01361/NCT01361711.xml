	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study side effect well give alemtuzumab ofatumumab together work treat patient previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Monoclonal antibody , alemtuzumab ofatumumab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer kill substance . Giving alemtuzumab together ofatumumab may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
