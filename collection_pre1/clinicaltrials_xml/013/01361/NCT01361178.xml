	<brief_summary>Immunosuppressive therapy lead remarkable improvement survival lung transplantation ( LT ) patient . However , one important adverse effect therapy increase emergence hypogammaglobulinemia ( HGG ) previously see mostly patient primary immunodeficiency ( PID ) . The goal treatment HGG PID maintain trough IgG level 500 mg/dl might provide good protection infection low IgG serum concentration . Although IgG therapy substantial benefit , dose trough level IgG optimal yet clearly establish . The impact high versus low IgG dosing frequency severity infection rejection study LT patient HGG . The specific aim study compare incidence infection lung transplant recipient receive high versus lower dose SQ IgG compare incidence infection lung transplant recipient mild hypogammaglobulinemia versus normal IgG level . This study single center study lung transplant recipient , age 18 year old , University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) , randomize treatment arm observational arm . The hypothesis research study : - Therapy IV SQ IgG substantial benefit reduce number infection lung transplant recipient severe hypogammaglobulinemia ( IgG &lt; 500 ) - A high dose SQ IgG , subsequent high trough IgG level , may higher impact frequency severity infection rejection episode , compare low dose SQ IgG , subsequent low IgG trough level - Lung transplant recipient mild hypogammaglobulinemia ( IgG= 500-750 ) high incidence infection compare patient normal IgG level</brief_summary>
