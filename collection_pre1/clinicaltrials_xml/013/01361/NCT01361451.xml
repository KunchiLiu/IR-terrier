	<brief_summary>There 24,000 admission year Intensive Care Units ( ICU ) United Kingdom due pneumonia , asthma common condition call chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , rate death 10 % , 40 % 50 % , respectively . These condition account 10 % ICU admission . It therefore important find would possible detect deterioration patient breathe problem early , order increase appropriately level care . Clinical early warning score ( EWS ) use many hospital detect patient whose medical condition get bad , likely need admission intensive care high dependency care unit . EWS usually calculate several measurement take patient , blood pressure , temperature heart rate . However , often inaccurate need calculate manually nursing staff number measurement take variety different device . Furthermore , even accurately calculate , clear helpful EWS predict whether patient deteriorate . Neural respiratory drive ( NRD ) objective indicator breathlessness , derive amount electrical activity occur certain muscle use breathing . The Myotrace system measure electrical activity , well measurement rate breathe heart rate . It analyse measurement together help identify patient risk deterioration . This study use Myotrace monitor patient severe breathe difficulty due acute worsen chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , early identification failure respond medical treatment .

	<detailed_description>Admissions hospital due breathing difficulty common . When patient ' medical condition worsens , deterioration often noticed patient need move area hospital provide high level care , e.g . intensive care unit high-dependency unit . Early warning score ( EWS ) design help medical nursing staff identify patient risk deteriorate . These score usually calculate patient measurement blood pressure heart rate . It clear effective score prevent patient deterioration , need intensive high-dependency care . The investigator therefore need another mean identify patient risk deterioration , particularly breathe difficulty . Neural respiratory drive term use describe nervous system 's response need increase breathing , may helpful predict whether patient admitted hospital breathing difficulty deteriorate . This response may measure amount electrical activity occur muscle associate breathing , supplied nerve deliver electrical message fibre make muscle . The main breathing muscle body diaphragm , sheet muscle lie beneath lung , , contract , move downwards draw air lung . Although electrical activity diaphragm may measure , achieve use technique involve pass electrical probe patient 's oesophagus , gullet . This easy patient admit unwell hospital breathing difficulty . Therefore , technique develop measure electrical activity occur parasternal muscle . These muscle lie either side sternum , breast bone , particularly important breathing muscle patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , lung disease commonly associate smoking . Parasternal muscle electrical activity measure probe attach skin chest wall , therefore achieve easily measure diaphragm electrical activity . Previous study show parasternal electrical activity comparable diaphragm electrical activity patient COPD , useful measure neural respiratory drive patient COPD . Neural respiratory drive show increased patient stable COPD . A pilot study involve 25 patient COPD show daily measurement parasternal electrical activity possible patient admit hospital acute worsen COPD . This study also demonstrate amount parasternal electrical activity reflect degree breathlessness experience patient acute worsen COPD . Importantly , study show measure relate parasternal electrical activity , hence neural respiratory drive , significantly different patient whose medical condition deteriorate , compare improved treatment . Clinical early warning score significantly different two group . Furthermore , measure relate parasternal electrical activity able predict whether patient acute worsen COPD would readmitted hospital within 7 14 day discharge . Therefore , measurement parasternal activity may helpful predict deterioration due treatment failure patient admit hospital acute worsen COPD . However , pilot study perform small number patient , large clinical trial Myotrace system , acquire , process analysis information , need demonstrate conclusively . This purpose current study . Patients acute worsen COPD , diagnose doctor , recruit Emergency Department acute admission ward St. Thomas ' Hospital , London . On admission , normal practice Patient At Risk ( PAR ) score record . This Early Warning Score use Guy 's St. Thomas ' NHS Foundation Trust ( GSTFT ) . Patients usually blood test check blood gas content part normal medical care . The research team identify potential candidate study two way : firstly , directly Emergency Department ; secondly , follow admission , new patient COPD see medical team directly responsible patient 's medical care COPD outreach team . The research team liaise medical COPD outreach team identify potential participant . Potential candidate give oral write information study . Patients ' capacity consent assess time . Patients give opportunity consider participate study 3 hour , write consent sought . The relatively short period time consideration due potential patient ' medical condition change rapidly . Following recruitment , patient ask history breathing difficulty . Height weight record possible . Patients ask breathless normally feel stable ( MRC dyspnoea score ) breathless currently feel ( visual-analogue scale ) . A blood sample may take ass marker inflammation enrollment ; inflammation COPD remain poorly understood , intended blood test inform study process . Parasternal electromyogram ( EMG ) electrodes attached patient 's chest , either side sternum ( breast bone ) , measure muscle electrical activity , breathe rate heart rate , use Myotrace system . Electrode position mark indelible ink , make sure electrode re-attached chest wall place wash activity . Electrodes also apply neck abdomen , muscle area also contribute significantly breathe . The patient first ask sniff hard possible nose , measure maximum electrical activity parasternal muscle generate . All measure muscle electrical activity express percentage maximum . Parasternal muscle electrical activity , breathe rate heart rate measure use Myotrace system , well normal bedside measurement temperature , blood pressure oxygen level . An Early Warning Score also calculate ( PAR score ) . Measurements take 20 minute three time day ( around 9am , 12 noon 6pm ) , patient discharge hospital . Patients also wear activity monitor , either wrist around neck . This monitor patient 's physical activity , know related decline breathe function patient COPD . The patient ask keep monitor throughout hospital stay three month discharge . The activity monitor light wear well-tolerated patient . Patients ask complete diary card record symptom three time day Myotrace measurement . Tests breathe function ( spirometry ) also perform . The research team inform medical team look patient result test , whilst patient remain hospital . When patient ready discharge home , he/she ask complete number questionnaire breathe difficulty quality life . A blood sample take stage marker inflammation . The research team note whether patient discharge support COPD outreach , see whether relationship offer support discharge muscle electrical activity . Patients offer follow-up appointment research team St. Thomas ' Hospital one month three month discharge hospital . During appointment , blood test may take check blood gas content persist infection inflammation . The patient ask complete questionnaire relate breathlessness quality life . Measurements breathe muscle electrical activity repeat , patient ' physical activity data analyse .</detailed_description>
