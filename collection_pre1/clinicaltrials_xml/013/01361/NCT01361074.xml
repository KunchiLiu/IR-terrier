Information Communication Technologies ( ICT ) like Virtual Reality ( VR ) Augmented Reality ( AR ) pioneer application improve treatment adherence acceptance . There exist study offer preliminary evidence efficacy AR treatment small animal phobia . However , control study explore differential efficacy ICT-based exposure intervention versus vivo exposure . In present study differential efficacy AR exposure versus vivo exposure treatment small animal phobia explore subject randomize controlled trial . A pre-treatment assessment conduct order establish diagnosis evaluate main outcome measure . All participant receive intensive exposure session follow Ã–st guideline , ( vivo exposure one experimental condition AR exposure experimental condition ) .
