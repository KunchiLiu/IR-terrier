	<brief_title>The Effect Blueberry Powder Supplementation Cardiovascular Risk Factors Subjects With Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause death United States . In large percentage case , risk factor CVD modifiable responsible patient 's phenotype identify appropriately treat . In particular , metabolic syndrome encompasses insulin resistance , central obesity , dyslipidemia hypertension , major risk factor CVD . These risk factor also cause underlie vascular abnormality , i.e . endothelial dysfunction , lead progression CVD . Endothelial function balance vasodilating vasoconstricting substance produce endothelium . Endothelial dysfunction common feature insulin resistance hypertension . In addition , endothelial dysfunction represent early step process atherosclerosis associate increased adverse CVD outcome . It well establish lifestyle modification ( change dietary intake increase physical activity ) effectively improve CVD risk factor associate metabolic syndrome . The success maintain lifestyle change human long term poor . Therefore , strategies reduce prevalence metabolic syndrome pharmacological mean adopt practice physician . However , widespread use dietary supplement general public , nutritional supplementation include use natural product effectively modify component metabolic syndrome represent attractive approach . A diet rich fruit vegetable clearly show significant health benefit . In particular , increased consumption blueberry demonstrate beneficial health effect CVD certain component metabolic syndrome , hypertension , insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes . These health benefit blueberry may attributable phenolic bioactive compound , anthocyanins , also antioxidant property . Although human animal study demonstrate anti-diabetic effect blueberry , paucity data detail efficacy increase blueberry consumption upon CVD risk factor modification human subject . Thus , give concern regard ability significantly increase maintain individual 's fruit vegetable consumption long-term , role dietary supplementation bioactive component contain whole blueberry become attractive , feasible daily dietary intervention . Our lab previously show obese , nondiabetic insulin-resistant human subject consume blueberry powder day ( form blueberry smoothie ) 6 week improve insulin sensitivity compare counterpart consume placebo smoothie . Unfortunately , definitive blood pressure measurement conduct study . The investigator use single clinic measurement show blood pressure lower effect consume blueberry smoothy . An 8-wk preclinical trialin spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rat , however , show supplementation blueberry powder lower systolic blood pressure . Thus , plausible blood pressure lower effect see previous study investigator evaluate suitable population ( hypertension ) use precise technique . Therefore , base positive result prior human study use blueberry powder increase insulin sensitivity give relationship CVD risk factor insulin resistance , project 's overall objective examine role dietary supplementation blueberry powder CVD risk factor subject metabolic syndrome . In particular , investigator evaluate change insulin sensitivity use frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test ( FSIVGTT ) , hypertension use precise ambulatory blood pressure monitoring system vascular reactivity surrogate marker underlie endothelial abnormality . To knowledge , research study evaluate endothelial function blueberry human . To accomplish goal , investigator conduct randomize , double-blinded placebo-controlled clinical study fix amount blueberry powder form smoothie . The investigator hypothesize increased daily consumption blueberry powder effective increase insulin sensitivity , decrease blood pressure , improve vascular wall function population metabolic syndrome high-risk CVD .</detailed_description>
