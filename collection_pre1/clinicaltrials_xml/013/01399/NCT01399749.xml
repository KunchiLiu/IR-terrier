	<brief_summary>The objective study compare safety effectiveness use autologous culture adipose tissue-derived stem cell versus culture autologous chondrocytes treatment chondral knee lesion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Mesenchymal Stem Cells vs. Chondrocytes Repair Chondral Knee Defects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chondral knee lesion frequent produce important functional limitation arthrosis development . Arthrosis one important cause disability treatment prosthetic surgery associate high cost , free complication . Several study cell therapy autologous chondrocytes show efficacy treatment type lesion , currently common technique treatment focal lesion articular cartilage . Autologous chondrocyte transplant associate morbidity cartilage sample removal , need intra-articular surgery , limited tissue sample culture . Adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cell ( ASC ) demonstrate chondrocytic differentiation use animal model articular cartilage repair . Adipose tissue yield ASC chondrocytes obtain cartilage , liposuction simple less adverse event arthroscopy . It worth mentioned culture condition less stringent ASC chondrocytes , term number passage obtain amount cell need implantation . We propose randomized clinical trial , compare surgical implantation either autologous chondrocytes autologous ASC treat chondral knee lesion .</detailed_description>
