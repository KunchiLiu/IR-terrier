	<brief_summary>The 6 minute walk ( 6MW ) give information exercise capacity important tool clinical decision prognostic evaluation PH patient . The test technically simple perform , inexpensive reproducible . During 6MW O2 saturation , heart rate , walk distance ( study every minute ) level dyspnea ( BORG-dyspnea scale ) may record ; however , present , mainly walk distance evaluate . The test sometimes criticize , dependence patient 's motivation . The purpose present study standardize test incorporation objective factor . The investigator correlate change heart rate dyspnea ( BORG scale ) achieve walk distance subsequent examination perform different effort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On two different day patient absolve four 6MW different level effort - day traditional test perform additionally test effort less effort . The order test randomize . These two day examination within maximum three month , provide sign relevant clinical change . After every minute walk distance determine . Heart rate O2 saturation measure pulsoxymetry whole test . Every two minute patient ask dyspnea ( Borg scale ) . The purpose present study standardize test incorporation objective factor detect correlation walk distance level effort exercise . The investigator expect reliability objectivity 6MW may increase standardization . The additionally perform cardiopulmonary exercise testing help evaluate stratify patient .</detailed_description>
