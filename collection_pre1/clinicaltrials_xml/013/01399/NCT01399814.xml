	<detailed_description>Perioperative fluid administration common therapy clinical practice , recent regime history 50 year . Recently , clinician find traditional regime disadvantage , example , pulmonary edema , increase cardiac load , increase body weight . And thus , perioperative fluid restriction regimen suggest prove could reduce cardiopulmonary complication mortality rate major elective gastrointestinal surgery . Patients divide two group randomly underwent restrict fluid regimen traditional fluid regimen . We determine complication immunological function two group , analyze relationship complication immunological change . Based decide probable mechanism perioperative fluid restriction effect complication .</detailed_description>
