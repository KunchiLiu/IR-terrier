	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Others interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , methotrexate , vincristine sulfate , procarbazine hydrochloride , cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill cancer cell . It yet know whether rituximab combination chemotherapy effective give without radiation therapy treat patient primary central nervous system lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give rituximab combination chemotherapy without radiation therapy work treat patient primary central nervous system lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine median progression-free survival ( PFS ) arm intent-to-treat basis . Secondary - To determine overall survival ( OS ) define interval randomization death due cause . - To determine treatment-related neurotoxicity rate disease-related cognitive deterioration arm , follow method : prospective formal neuropsychological evaluation , utilize competing-risk methodology account death compete risk neurotoxicity cognitive deterioration relapse tumor burden/salvage treatment incidence clinically define neurotoxicity per investigator 's assessment . - To determine exists difference two treatment arm term health-related quality-of-life symptom time . - To determine response ( partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) ) rate methotrexate-based chemotherapy consolidation whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) . - To determine chemotherapy-related toxicity , measure Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) , v.4.0 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center recursive-partitioning analysis ( RPA ) classification primary central nervous system lymphoma age Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) ( Class 1 : age ≤ 50 year vs Class 2 : age &gt; 50 year KPS ≥ 70 % vs Class 3 : age &gt; 50 year KPS &lt; 70 % ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive rituximab IV 5 hour per institutional guideline day 1 15 , methotrexate IV 2 hour day 2 16 , vincristine sulfate IV day 2 16 ( course 1 2 ) , procarbazine hydrochloride orally ( PO ) day 2-8 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive consolidation therapy comprise cytarabine IV 3 hour day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive rituximab , methotrexate , vincristine sulfate , procarbazine hydrochloride arm I . After complete chemotherapy ( 2-5 week later ) , patient without progressive disease undergo low-dose whole-brain radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , approximately 2.5 week ( 13 fraction total ) . Patients receive consolidation cytarabine arm I . Patients may undergo blood buccal sample collection future correlative study . Paraffin-embedded tissue block primary tumor core tumor tissue punch tissue block , cerebrospinal fluid may also collect . Patients may also complete Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised ( HVLT-R ) , Trail Making Test Part A Part B , Controlled Oral Word Association Test ( COWAT ) , Quality Life ( QOL ) questionnaires baseline periodically study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 2 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
