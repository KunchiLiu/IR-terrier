	<brief_summary>There standard care management follow parotidectomies . Most practitioner however place drain ( usually flat Davol close suction drain/ Hemovac investigator institution ) wind bed end procedure , usually remove day follow surgery , drain output reach subjective number ( depend surgeon preference ) . The investigator hypothesis difference hematoma/bleeding infection rate post parotidectomy drain remove recovery area day surgery prior discharge , compare drain keep place least 1 day drainage le 50 cc/24 hr . The investigator would therefore like undergo randomize control clinical trial ass rate significant hematoma formation infection , need readmission length admission secondary complication compare 2 group : one drain remove prior discharge recovery area patient discharge drain see next post operative day office .

	<brief_title>Timing Postoperative Drain Removal Following Parotidectomy - Prospective Randomized Controlled Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Parotidectomies involve removal portion parotid gland facial nerve case superficial parotidectomies , total removal gland case total parotidectomies . The common indication procedure benign neoplasms pleomorphic adenoma , oncocytomas Warthin tumor , malignant involvement gland metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma . Hematoma formation bleed follow parotidectomy less emphasize early complication procedure , usually secondary unrecognized incomplete hemostasis prior incision closure . Hematoma formation rate post parotidectomy report vary 3.8 % ( Upton et al . ) 6.1 % ( Laccourreye et al. ) . In case bleed rapidly expand hematoma , patient usually bring back operating room surgical drainage hematoma surgical control identify bleeding vessel ( Myers et al ) . Small hematoma usually manage expectantly . Wound infection follow parotidectomy usually also range around 3.8 % ( Upton et al . ) 5.4 % ( Henney et al ) . Hypothesis : There difference hematoma/bleeding infection rate post parotidectomy drain remove recovery area day surgery prior discharge , compare drain keep place least 1 day drainage le 50 cc/24 hr . Justification study : Review literature show paucity publication particular complication post operative preventative management . The current postoperative management follow parotidectomies evidence base , institution surgeon dependent , range primary closure without drain , placement drain remove either post-operative day 1-14 ( hospital community ) , overnight stay patient hospitalization drain remove . Patel et al . 2006 publish review postoperative drainage follow parotidectomies , include primary closure without drain , drain , absorbable hemostatic agent fibrin sealant . As mentioned author , suction drain prevent hematoma , help remove drainage close dead space . In paper , average drain output post operative day 1 27.1 ml , author address optimal time drain removal . The timing removal neck drain follow head neck surgery address Harris T. et al , find drain could safely remove volume fall 50 ml less 24 hour period , 9 % patient develop seromas . Moreover , retrospective review time neck hematoma formation post carotid endarterectomy show 95 % patient experience neck hematoma neurological deficit occur within 8 hour follow surgery , indicate even discharge possible follow type surgery ( Sheehan M.K et al ) . In prospective four arm randomize control trial investigating use subcutaneous catheter drain antibiotic irrigation abdominal incision closure , Farnell et al . find statistical difference infection rate wound lesser degree contamination ( Type II III ) group without drain drain 4 day . Clean procedure ( Type I wind ) parotidectomies thus similar infection rate temporary drain compare drain . The optimal time catheter removal however address study . The primary investigator note 30 year practice Head Neck surgeon significant hematoma formation bleed would require surgical management follow parotidectomy usually early complication often recognize within hour follow surgery due superficiality wound , patient postoperative area . It belief removal drain post operative area , prior patient 's discharge allow decrease risk unrecognized bleed decrease risk nosocomial infection patient colonization resistant bacterial strain , unnecessary prolong discomfort patient form drain , well unnecessary use hospital resource need overnight stay hospital . The average cost one postsurgical hospital day province resident Vancouver General Hospital cost C $ 3000 per day . We also believe wound infection rate would equivalent less . Clinical equipoise exists still controversy time drain removal . Since previous study address need optimal time surgical drain removal follow parotidectomies , would also like undertake randomize control trial address hematoma infection rate post parotidectomy patient , depend whether drain remove recovery area , next post operative day . This would follow retrospective review study ( H11-01433 ) . Objectives : In prospective randomize controlled trial , would like assess rate hematoma formation infection , need readmission length admission secondary complication compare 2 group : one drain remove prior discharge recovery area patient discharge drain see next post operative day office . The drain output measure drain take . Research Methods : - A prospective randomized control trial : - Inclusion criterion : patient age ≥ 18 year old , competent , undertake unilateral bilateral parotidectomies Vancouver General Hospital , Vancouver ; St. Paul 's Hospital , Vancouver ; Surrey Memorial Hospital , Surrey , Eagle Ridge Hospital , Port Moody . - Exclusion criterion : patient anticoagulation therapy , ASA ≥ 3 patient would require post operative overnight admission secondary comorbidities , immunosuppression concurrent radiation chemotherapy receive high dose corticosteroid , concommitant infection require antibiotic , patient additional head neck procedure time parotidectomy , skin excision ( eg . Modified neck dissection , mandibulectomy , external auditory canal resection ) - Patients recruited consent obtain ( see detail consent ) . - The consented patient randomly assign unique subject number , derive personal identifier , randomly assign either 2 arm group , use opaque envelope open skin closure : 1 . Drain placement patient discharge drain . The patient see next postoperative day surgeon drain output measure drain take . In unlikely case drain output exceed 50 cc/24 hr , patient ask come back 3rd post operative day drain removal , output likely even less 50cc/24 hr ( Harris , T et al. ) . 2 . Drain placement removal prior discharge postoperative day recovery area , irrespective volume drain ( volume measure ) . - Permutated block 4 , unbeknownst surgeon use allow equal balance sample size 2 group . - The patient stratify basis hospital surgery . - The patient surgeon blind end surgery . The outcome assessor blind different arm set . - If clinical judgment require patient admit , drain kept longer assigned time , patient analyze intention treat basis . - Outcomes measure include : - Significant Hematoma /Bleeding rate ( primary outcome ) - Infection rate - Length hospitalization - Need surgical reexploration - Definitions : - Significant Hematoma : Blood collection/Bleeding wound site diagnose doctor require surgical management . - Infection : Record positive pus culture patient hospital , record abscess diagnose physician clinical exam , image surgical drainage , spontaneous drainage purulent material wound incision associate localized pain . Wound erythema spontaneously resolve include outcome . - Length hospitalization : Number night patient stay hospital . - Surgical reexploration : Patient bring back OR hemostasis wound incision open drain follow hematoma abscess formation . - The outcome measure outcome assessor 30 day post operatively , outcome determine contact patient ( questionnaire , telephone interview ) , regard presence absence significant hematoma , infection , number night spend hospital whether surgical exploration , definition outcomes give . These outcome confirm via patient 's chart review surgeon . - Details consent : - Source contact information : - From primary health care provider 's file ( primary investigator ) . - Who collect contact information : - The investigator act health care provider obtain list patient 's name VGH ENT outpatient clinic consent parotidectomies . - Who make initial contact prospective subject initial contact make : - Non-coercive initial contact prospective participant undertake numerous approach : notice invite prospective participant post clinic room , wait room well secretary 's office outpatient VGH ENT Clinic . Interested prospective participant either call investigator , mail information package address secretary ( act study co-ordinator ) hand information package . - The secretary ( act study co-ordinator ) also hand package prospective potential participant . The package contain introductory letter sign Primary Investigator describe background behind study , justification aim study well methodology study detail contact investigator . In letter , also notify investigator ( involved primary care , along state relationship VGH ENT clinic Primary Investigator ) contact within next 1-2 week give information study , answer question might see whether would interested participate study . They would also invite call Primary investigator/ health care provider question person make initial contact respond . Additionally , confirm write patient 's decision participation impact patient 's level care . Also include package consent form study . - On hand package , secretary/co-ordinator tell prospective participant health care provider colleague undertaking study involve surgery undergoing invite learn study package . The co-ordinator also let know verbally Primary Investigator 's colleague , also work clinic , contact within next 1-2 week discus project detail see whether would interested study ( also mention write introductory letter ) . - If investigator ( involve care patient ) clinic time prospective participant clinic , introduce prospective participant detail relationship VGH ENT clinic Primary Investigator , hand package patient , invite go detail study inform patient call within follow 2 week discus study detail see whether would interested participating . - The relationship study team member prospective participant : - The prospective participant Primary Investigator 's care ; therefore , PI make initial contact detail . - The investigator involve study ( PGY2 ENT resident ) involve care patient , secretary/acting co-ordinator therefore create coercive contact prospective participant . - The consent form explain investigator involve care patient ( also work VGH ENT clinic ) , via phone , within 1-2 week follow prospective participant ' receipt information package ( include consent form ) , obtain time clinic visit mail . - The consent obtain phone discussion study , patient ask sign consent form include information package clinic visit mail consent prepay envelope . If patient decide think whether want participate , invite bring consent form day surgery . The procedure undertake phone since participant recruitment take place time patient visit clinic , minimize patient inconvenience form mobilization ( unless prospective participant prefer ) face face discussion . - During phone call , patient give information concern background behind study , justification well objective undertake study . The patient advise , consent participate study , would know arm would assign surgery . - The patient would reassure decision participate study would impact level care . - They inform randomize arm # 1 , would give appointment time follow day meet one author drain output measurement drain removal . In unlikely event drain output &gt; 50 cc/24 hr , another appointment post operative day 3 arrange removal measurement drain output . - They would also inform one author study would contact 30 day mark ask whether bleeding/significant hematoma , infection number night spend hospital whether surgical exploration , definition outcomes give . They would also inform obtain information would confirm hospital medical record . - Time dedicate discussion study prior consent : 15 minute unless patient additional question ; take place within 2 week receipt information package . - Maximum time need dedicate study patient randomize group drain remove post operative day : 1 minute . - Maximum time need dedicate study patient randomize group drain remove next post operative day : 15 minute ( exclude transportation time ) - Maximum time require questionnaire filling/over phone questionnaire ( exclude time require post prepaid envelope ) : 5 minute ; take place 1 month follow surgery . - Potential benefit subject could arise participation propose research : Possible therapeutic benefit include frequent follow- visit ( therefore patient reassurance ) control arm . - Provisions make break code double-blind study emergency situation , indicate code : There need provision unblind patient surgeon arm drain place . The surgeon patient unblinded end surgery . - All paper form study data include consent form hold locked filling cabinet ENT Department Vancouver General Hospital . Patients assigned random unique number patient log , keep appropriately secure electronic form . Data collect identify use unique subject number derive personal identifier ; i.e . data collect already de-identified entered database . This file contain data collection also password protect . Provisions consent process : No provision possible consenting process consent discuss patient phone . Sample size &amp; Statistical Analysis : 400 patient recruit achieve power 0.8 , take account intention treat analysis undertaken , assumed average rate hematoma formation post parotidectomy late drain removal group 10 % 2.5 % early drain removal group . - At 100th patient , interim analysis undertaken , significant difference hematoma infection rate ( p &lt; 0.05 ) , study stop . Additional patient would already enrol randomize yet would contact write advised result study end study . - The result anonymously analyze use t-Test medical statistician . The result study publish medical journal . The data keep minimum five year follow publication study result , follow hard copy shred computer database delete .</detailed_description>
