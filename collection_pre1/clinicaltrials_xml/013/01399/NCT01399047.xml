	<detailed_description>Juvenile Neuronal Ceroid Lipofuscinosis ( JNCL ) fatal disorder . Currently treatment symptomatic . Thus , real need intervene slow progression disease . Preliminary data genetic knock-down ability mount immune response cln3-knockout mouse supportive strategy treat JNCL immuno-suppressive agent . Many drug ability suppress immune system steroidal deem unsuitable long-term administration child . Mycophenolate mofetil ( CellCept ) use immunosuppressive agent allogenic transplant pediatric patient therefore approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) pediatric use . The study design double-blind , randomize , 22-week cross-over study mycophenolate mofetil vs. placebo . After 4-week washout period , subject undergo blind crossover active study drug placebo placebo active study drug . Subjects caregiver evaluate person University Rochester Batten Center ( URBC ) screening/baseline , week 8 , 12 , 20 . In addition , subject evaluate local clinician formalize member research team . Such contact occur Weeks 2 , 4 , 14 , 16 , unscheduled early termination visit . There also regular telephone contact URBC local clinician . We select dosage currently FDA approve use child treat prophylaxis renal transplant rejection .</detailed_description>
