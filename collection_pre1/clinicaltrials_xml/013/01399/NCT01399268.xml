	<brief_summary>Inflammation related cytokine release know occur surgery . The cytokine IL6 , major marker inflammation know increase total joint replacement surgery . IL6 find elevate postoperatively patient hip fracture link mental status change possibly complication . It known lead shock participate inflammatory state see sepsis . High level link postoperative fever , confusion , symptom depression , acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) fat embolism syndrome ( FES ) . Previously investigator find low dose steroid give two dos initial perioperative period decrease amount IL6 release compare placebo , sustain past 24 hour . Desmosine stable breakdown product elastin lung tissue measure urine sample . It consider marker lung injury find elevated patient ARDS , congestive obstructive pulmonary disease FES . Previously , investigator find urine desmosine level rise bilateral total knee replacement compare unilateral total knee replacement indicate possible lung injury . Therefore investigator hypothesize : Continued low dose steroid give three time 24 hour period : 1 . Significantly decrease peak IL6 cytokine release bilateral total knee replacement maintain reduction IL6 beyond 24 hour . 2 . Decrease urinary desmosine level , hence protective lung injury .</brief_summary>
