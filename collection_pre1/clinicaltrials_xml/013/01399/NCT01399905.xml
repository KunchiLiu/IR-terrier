	<detailed_description>A . Specific Aims : Parkinson 's disease common neurodegenerative disorder characterize progressive motor symptom tremor , rigidity , bradykinesia . The prevalence estimate 102-109/100,000 increase age . It second common neurodegenerative disorder Alzheimer 's disease , annual cost US estimate $ 14.3 billion dollar per year . In Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) dopamine contain neuron substantia nigra selectively lose , cause motor dysfunction . Dopamine level may increase give oral levodopa , improve motor function PD . After oral administration , levodopa take brain converted dopamine aromatic amino acid decarboxylase ( AAAD ) enzyme striatum , result improve dopaminergic neurotransmission . AAAD find peripheral tissue well brain , prior passage central nervous system levodopa may decarboxylate dopamine small bowel liver . Peripheral metabolism levodopa dopamine significantly reduce amount levodopa reach brain therefore dopamine available neurotransmission . The presence dopamine periphery also produce anorexia nausea . Carbidopa AAAD inhibitor reduces conversion levodopa dopamine . It think cross blood-brain barrier affect peripheral AAAD . This concept fundamental importance current treatment PD . Carbidopa potentiate levodopa much low dose effective . It also reduce anorexia nausea , often occur give levodopa alone . For reason , almost levodopa market carbidopa/levodopa tablet . This combination drug become standard care PD . As disease progress , increasingly high amount carbidopa/levodopa combination give ensure adequate motor functioning , though response treatment become much less predictable frequent fluctuation motor ability . Though conventional wisdom old pharmacological study suggest carbidopa penetrate blood-brain barrier , recent animal study contradict . This important carbidopa enter central nervous system human could significantly inhibit levodopa conversion dopamine , thus reduce therapeutic effect . A single large dose carbidopa give normal rat , rat chemically lesioned mimic PD , result carbidopa entrance central nervous system , inhibition brain AAAD conversion levodopa dopamine ( 1 , 2 ) . It know whether prolong use high dose carbidopa worsen motor function time human . A small series patient PD motor fluctuation switch carbidopa/levodopa levodopa alone report improvement motor feature ( 3 ) . Carbidopa typically give one four ratio carbidopa levodopa pill , chronic high dose caribopa levodopa common PD . If carbidopa penetrate central nervous system human could lead decreased conversion levodopa dopamine central nervous system , decrease therapeutic response administer levodopa . We propose randomize , double blind , control trial crossover explore two mechanism carbidopa may accumulate CNS . If give high dos 4 week , carbidopa may slowly accumulate central nervous system impair dopamine synthesis thereby motor function PD . Aim # 1 : Compare motor response 2 hour levodopa infusion 4 week high dose carbidopa 4 week low dose carbidopa . After 4 week high dose carbidopa , subject may notice `` '' time 4 week low dose carbidopa . Changes response levodopa evaluate patient diary need increase daily levodopa . Aim 2 : Determine clinical response oral levodopa end 4 week treatment high dose carbidopa low dose carbidopa measure `` on/off '' diary total daily levodopa dose . An alternate reason carbidopa enter central nervous system ( CNS ) blood-brain barrier become abnormal result age PD . In case single large dose carbidopa may enter CNS reduce conversion levodopa dopamine . Aim # 3 : Compare clinical response 2 hour levodopa infusion administer 25mg carbidopa 150mg carbidopa . Demonstrating high dos carbidopa diminishe response levodopa would alter current practice , clinicians presently concern quantity carbidopa administer patient PD . As result study , significant insight management advance PD gain . The overall goal well understand use high dose carbidopa may paradoxically complicate treatment . A positive negative finding important therapeutic implication . This study potential fundamentally change treat PD . B . Background Significance : B . 1 Parkinson 's Disease PD common neurodegenerative disorder result progressive tremor , rigidity , bradykinesia . The risk develop PD increase age . The prevalence range 102-109/100,000 Western country incidence rate 1.7 per 1000 person year ( 4 , 5 ) . There increase direct cost individual substantial indirect cost family ( 6 , 7 ) . The overall estimate cost PD US $ 14.3 billion dollar annually ( 8 ) . Though PD associate variety clinical feature , patient typically present motor dysfunction . Motor sign cause loss dopaminergic neuron substantia nigra . The mainstay treatment motor sign correction dopaminergic neurotransmission oral administration levodopa , precursor dopamine . The risk death PD significantly reduce use levodopa responsiveness levodopa treatment strong predictor survival ( 9 , 10 ) . B . 2 . Pharmacology Levodopa Carbidopa Levodopa take small bowel heavily metabolize AAAD locate intestinal mucosa , less degree liver . As result first pass peripheral metabolism , bioavailability levodopa serum oral administration approximately 30 % ( 11 ) peripheral metabolism levodopa continue first pas metabolism small amount levodopa enters CNS AAAD inhibit . Carbidopa AAAD inhibitor give along levodopa prevent peripheral conversion levodopa dopamine , increase overall bioavailability levodopa two fourfold . Higher dos carbidopa produce high plasma level levodopa . Carbidopa also clinical importance since carbidopa reduces anorexia nausea related effect dopamine area postrema effectively outside blood-brain barrier . Traditional clinical thinking assume carbidopa penetrate blood brain barrier , virtue interfere central conversion levodopa dopamine ( 12 ) . The study support assumption rely animal model utilize single dos carbidopa ( 13 ) ( 14 ) . Clinical dictum indicate minimum 75 milligram carbidopa give daily produce reasonable inhibition AAAD . Aside primary effect inhibit decarboxylation levodopa periphery potentiate effect levodopa , carbidopa demonstrate pharmacological effect . Since carbidopa think penetrate blood brain barrier consider peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor . B . 3 . Carbidopa Acts Centrally Prevent Formation Dopamine Evidence laboratory study appear recent year suggest carbidopa penetrates blood brain barrier great extent realize . One piece evidence base single injection model use microdialysate technique drug level measurement normal rat ( 1 ) . A single high dose carbidopa 50mg/kg may inhibit aromatic amino acid decarboxylase activity striatum normal rat 75 % ( 2 ) . Benserazide peripheral AAAD inhibitor similar carbidopa . Benserazide administration 50mg/kg prolongs time reach peak dopamine level 60 minute centrally . Administration benserazide 10mg/kg 50mg/kg decrease striatal AAAD activity normal rat 28 % 78 % respectively , rat model mimic PD benserazide 10mg/kg 50mg/kg decrease striatal AAAD activity 75 % 88 % , respectively ( 15 ) . Even small percent dose carbidopa enters CNS , long-term use could allow carbidopa accumulate clearance carbidopa rapid . A small study suggest motor fluctuation improve advanced PD patient receive levodopa without aromatic amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor ( 3 ) . It demonstrate earlier study experimental formulation extend release carbidopa/levodopa patient bad motor function three time dose carbidopa/levodopa despite adequate plasma levodopa level ( 16 ) . High dose carbidopa typically use advanced PD . When high dose carbidopa give chronically may create situation carbidopa accumulate central nervous system could thereby worsen motor function . B . 4 . Alteration Blood Brain Barrier PD May Be Mechanism Which Carbidopa Inhibits Central AAAD Another consideration blood brain barrier alter PD could allow entry substance previously sequester periphery ( 17 ) . As PD progress patient receive large dos carbidopa along levodopa order manage motor fluctuation . Chronic levodopa administration often result dyskinesias circumstance . Histochemical evidence animal model levodopa induced dyskinesia suggest dysfunction blood brain barrier . Signs angiogenesis serum albumin leakage two finding support vascular alteration model ( 18 ) . Chronic administration MPTP primates increase VEGF-expressing neuron increase number blood vessel substantia nigra par comptacta ( 19 ) . Similarly , 6-hydroxydopamine model PD , primates patchy loss blood brain barrier region associate angiogenesis ( 20 ) . In small autopsy study human PD vascularity present substantia nigra par compacta compare control ( 21 ) . Blood brain barrier alteration could lead increase penetration carbidopa periphery time two different scenario . Firstly , carbidopa clearing mechanism transport pump may overwhelm small amount accumulate time . Secondly , degree blood-brain barrier alteration may great even single large dose carbidopa may enter CNS . Carbidopa penetrate blood brain barrier limit extent single injection normal rat . Since blood brain barrier could alter PD might significant inhibition central AAAD . Either effect long-term multiple daily dos carbidopa single large dose carbidopa could lead significant decrease amount available dopamine , thereby worsen clinical feature PD . C. Preliminary Studies / Experience Investigators : Our group extensive experience randomize controlled clinical trial proof principle study PD . This include large number levodopa infusion protocol similar propose current study . We recently complete study examine dose effect apomorphine motor fluctuation ( Gunzler press ) , clinical test concomitantly dose levodopa methylphenidate ( 22 ) , evolution response levodopa course PD ( 23 ) . We conduct pilot study involve outpatient Clinical Translational Research Center ( CTRC formerly GCRC ) admission levodopa carbidopa ( 16 , 24 ) . Furthermore involved research basic pharmacology clinical effect levodopa ( 25-35 ) . D. Research Design Methods D. 1 . Overall Study Design This study randomize , double-blind , \controlled , crossover trial four week outpatient treatment period levodopa either carbidopa 450mg daily carbidopa 75mg daily plus placebo ( figure 1 ) . Levodopa dose separately individual capsule dose interval maximize motor function . Subjects select base inclusionary exclusionary criterion randomize start either high dose carbidopa group low dose carbidopa group . After randomization subject give four week outpatient treatment levodopa either high dose carbidopa low dose carbidopa plus placebo . After four week treatment phase subject bring Clinical Translational Research Center OHSU ( CTRC ) total three day . Included two day measure objective motor function levodopa infusion along different dose carbidopa two day . The evening admission CTRC subject turn rating outpatient clinical state collect structured diary . After visit crossover alternately receive either high dose carbidopa low dose carbidopa another four week . They bring CTRC second two day measurement motor function levodopa infusion different dose schedule carbidopa two day . They turn rating outpatient clinical state collect structured diary . Both subject investigator remain blinded dose carbidopa outpatient phase one two day inpatient phase study .</detailed_description>
