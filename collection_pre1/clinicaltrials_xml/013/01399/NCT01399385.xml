	<brief_summary>Background : - Imaging test , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , provide information heart blood vessel . The test let doctor see amount blood vessel narrow vessel wall thickness . This information may help diagnose treat heart disease condition lead heart attack . Better MRI method need improve heart disease diagnosis , especially avoid use radiation . Researchers test new technique improve quality heart MRI , compare complex study like catheterization angiography . Objectives : - To compare heart MRI technique test use diagnose heart disease . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age either may heart disease , healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , blood test . - They angiography study inside blood vessel . This test x-ray study blood vessel . It do either separately part set test diagnose possible heart disease . - Participants least one five MRI scan . The scan involve different method study heart blood vessel . Participants may also compute tomography scan confirm finding MRI scan . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specialized imaging technique available allow unique opportunity characterize micro-environment human body . Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) vascular wall imaging angiography ( MRA ) develop technique permit non-invasive evaluation arterial venous structure without need x-ray base catheter angiography . In addition , vessel wall image provide unprecedented non-invasive tool ass vascular endothelial function . While dramatic progress make cardiovascular MR imaging last year , still substantial limitation resolution , accuracy , reproducibility MRA wall image comprehensive structural functional evaluation coronary artery . The first aim study develop optimize clinical imaging protocol technique fast high-resolution coronary MRA wall image assessment coronary main artery structural , distensibility , endothelial functional parameter . Technique optimization performance evaluation accomplish normal subject without know suspected coronary atherosclerosis . The second aim protocol evaluate early MR imagery sign arterial structural , distensibility , endothelial functional disorder associate atherosclerosis cohort patient know suspected coronary atherosclerosis . Results accelerate high-resolution MRA correlate correspond Computerized Tomography Coronary Angiogram ( CTA ) result . The third aim protocol develop , implement , optimize new non-invasive method characterization micro-environment thoracic abdominal area utilize specialize technique MR Spectroscopy , MR Elastography , blood oxygenation level dependent ( BOLD ) imaging . The long-term objective study research initiative optimize coronary MRA , wall , body image technique point reliably use routine prevention assessment early atherosclerosis disease .</detailed_description>
