	<brief_title>International Multicenter Registry Mechanical Recanalization Procedures Acute Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mechanical recanalization procedure increasingly use large vessel stroke , i.e . proximal middle cerebral artery ( MCA ) basilar artery ( BA ) occlusion . This trend due limited efficacy approve acute stroke treatment , systemic thrombolysis , large vessel occlusion also due new technical innovation trigger development numerous device thrombus extraction . Within large single-arm trial , device demonstrate potential respect acceptable complication- substantial recanalization rate . Nevertheless , clinical outcome stroke patient frequently poor despite elaborate , aggressive , also complex costly treatment regimen . The factor determine good poor clinical outcome mechanical recanalization remain determine . The goal ENDOSTROKE-registry systemic evaluation technical clinical feature might important development evaluation endovascular treatment strategy acute stroke . Special emphasis lay assessment clinical outcome ( 90 day MRS ) . Concerning technical periprocedural aspect , focus put time issue i.e . intra-hospital time delay , duration angiographic procedure vessel patency achieved.It plan enroll approximately 500 patient registry . In first line , prospective patient include register ( start date January 2011 ) retrospective inclusion patient treat within three year start register allow long consecutive patient registration guarantee ( exclude selection bias ) . Data analysis include univariate multivariate approach respect clinical outcome measure .</detailed_description>
