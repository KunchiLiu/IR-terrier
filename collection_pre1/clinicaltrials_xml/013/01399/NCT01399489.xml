	<brief_title>Aerobic Training Arterial Stiffness Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The focus current research group examine impact lifestyle intervention development cardiovascular disease ( CV ) chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient . The study propose determine effect short-term aerobic train arterial stiffness blood pressure ( BP ) CKD patient . Arterial stiffness choose dependent variable since one important predictor CV complication hypertension know play critical role development CV progression CKD ( 6 , 41 ) . The specific aim study : ( ) determine effect short-term aerobic train arterial stiffness CKD patient , ( b ) determine effect short-term aerobic training rest ambulatory blood pressure ( ABP ) CKD patient ( c ) determine effect short-term aerobic train acute post-exercise blood pressure response CKD patient since acute response may relate change follow period chronic training . Fifty , 35-70 yr old , stage 3 CKD patient , either diabetes hypertension primary cause CKD recruit study . Subjects randomly assign either exercise group ( ExG = 25 ) control group ( CG = 25 ) . At start study subject attend 4 research session . During first session , rest 24 hr ABP reading record . In second session , anthropometric measure , peak oxygen uptake ( VO2peak ) , ABP value measure . Sessions 3 &amp; 4 performed random order . During session , pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , augmentation index ( AIx ) BP measure baseline rest period . Subjects either walk 30 min 50-60 % VO2 peak , sit quietly equal period time . BP monitor 60 min recovery follow exercise ABP take subsequent 24 hr . ExG perform supervise aerobic train 45-50 min , 3 time per week , moderate intensity , 16 week . CG continue activity daily live give exercise program . All subject retested week 8 BP , ABP , arterial stiffness week 16 variable . After 16 week study group retested use identical procedure baseline . A series 2 X 2 analysis covariance age , baseline PWV , AIx BP covariates , use determine effect 16 week intervention period primary outcome variable . A 2 X 7 X 2 , mixed factorial repeat measure ANOVA use analyze post-exercise data Pearson Moment Correlation Coefficient compute examine relationship post-exercise acute response BP change follow chronic training . An alpha level 0.05 used analysis .</detailed_description>
