	<detailed_description>Aim 1 . To determine whether diseased periodontal tissue biopsied patient periodontal disease alter DNA methylation pattern select gene compare DNA methylation status biopsy obtain adjacent , non-diseased periodontal site , well periodontal biopsy sample obtain non-diseased , healthy subject . Aim 2 . To determine role tissue DNA Methylation mRNA expression : - 2a . To determine whether alteration tissue mRNA expression ( determine quantitative PCR ) associate aberrant DNA methylation status respective gene promoter CpG islands tissue biopsy sample obtain diseased non-diseased tissue patient periodontal disease non-diseased healthy subject . - 2b . By perform laser capture microdissection biopsy sample diseased patient [ ( epithelium , connective tissue inflammatory infiltrate ) ] seek determine cellular pattern mRNA expression DNA methylation target gene compare inflamed non-inflamed site within diseased patient . - 2c . We perform vitro study analyze whether gingival fibroblast patient periodontal disease show differential methylation pattern whether cell display differential inflammatory response compare control fibroblast isolate healthy subject . Aim 3 . The aim pilot investigation determine miRNA expression differ presence absence obesity , compare gingival biopsy obtain patient without periodontal disease . - 3a . To determine whether diseased periodontal tissue biopsied patient periodontal disease influence level miRNA expression compare biopsy obtain non-diseased , healthy subject . - 3b . To determine whether BMI [ nonobese subject BMI &lt; 30kg/m2 , obese subject &gt; 30kg/m2 ] influence level miRNA expression biopsy diseased periodontal tissue compare periodontal biopsy sample obtain non-diseased , healthy subject . Gingival sample , gingival crevicular fluid , saliva plaque sample collect periodontal examination perform . The periodontal assessment record pocket depth , clinical attachment level percent bleed probe . Blood pressure , height weight ( Body Mass Index assessment ) obtain participant well . Tissue gene expression quantitative PCR DNA methylation sequence analysis , proteomic analysis gingival crevicular fluid , Differential Methylation Hybridization , microRNA expression profile Human miRNA Microarray Real-time PCR quantification perform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must adult male female age 18 65 year ( inclusive ) . Subjects must able willing follow study procedure instruction . Subjects must read , understood sign informed consent form . Subjects must present least 20 teeth functional dentition , exclude third molar . Subjects must good general health . Subjects must present advanced chronic periodontitis ( American Dental Association Class 4 ) determine investigator designee screen periodontal examination . Such subject exhibit periodontal pocketing ( &gt; 5 mm Bleeding Probing ) severe alveolar bone loss . Subjects active care periodontitis treatment plan periodontal flap surgery . Control subject must present periodontal health determine investigator designee screen periodontal examination . Such subject exhibit evidence periodontal pocketing ( pocket â‰¤4mm ) , bleed probe site biopsy . Patients group treatment plan routine crown extension procedure restorative reason , volunteer general population meeting inclusion criterion . 24 subject group 2 enrol base Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . Twelve obese subject ( BMI 30 great ) twelve nonobese subject ( BMI less 30 ) enrol . Twelve obese twelve nonobese group split half base periodontal status . 6 periodontal healthy nonobese 6 periodontal healthy obese 6 periodontal diseased nonobese 6 periodontal diseased obese Individuals chronic disease oral manifestation . Individuals exhibit gross oral pathology . Treatment antibiotic medical dental condition within 1 month prior screen examination . Chronic treatment ( i.e. , two week ) medication know affect periodontal status ( e.g. , phenytoin , calcium antagonist , cyclosporin , coumadin , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug , aspirin ) within one month screen examination . Ongoing medication initiate less three month prior enrollment ( i.e. , medication chronic medical condition must initiate least three month prior enrollment ) . Subjects clinically significant organ disease include impaired renal function , bleed disorder . Subjects active infectious disease hepatitis , HIV tuberculosis . Severe unrestored caries , condition likely require antibiotic treatment trial , include need prophylactic antibiotic</criteria>
