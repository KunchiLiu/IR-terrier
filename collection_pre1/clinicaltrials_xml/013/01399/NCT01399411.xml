	<brief_summary>Background : - The Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) look long-term health effect farm exposure include pesticide , crop , animal . The chronic health effect exposure pesticide easy study farmer spouse . They know chemical use tend live place adult life . AHS participant expect report change health . This include new medical condition . Researchers want follow report confirm accuracy . Objectives : - To follow AHS participant self-reported new disease confirm diagnosis . Eligibility : - Current AHS participant . Design : - Researchers confirm self-reported change medical condition contact AHS participant ask information . - The AHS participant give permission researcher contact doctor look medical record . They also ask provide cheek swab saliva sample . - Diseases interest rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , Sjogren Syndrome . Other disease follow future . Other disease follow future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pesticides common environmental exposure due widespread use agricultural , residential , public health purpose . Farmers family represent unique population study chronic health effect pesticides farmer know chemical use , furthermore , farmer tend remain location adult life . The Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) , cohort approximately 89,000 pesticide applicator spouses Iowa North Carolina , large US cohort study individual work pesticide . The AHS cohort enrol 1993 1997 assess human health effect associate well-characterized exposure pesticides agricultural factor . Detailed exposure data collect enrollment two five-year follow-up interview . As result , AHS wealth information pesticide use farmer spouse , well ability account change pesticide use time . Information medical history important covariates also collect enrollment follow-up interview , continue collect time.Only mortality cancer incidence update annually linkage vital statistic cancer registry ; health outcome base self-reported information participants.The accuracy self-reported health outcome information vary quite good ( e.g. , asthma ) poor ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis ) . In order ensure high quality epidemiologic analysis , validation self-reported disease necessary prior statistical analysis . To date , several health endpoint validate follow-up AHS participant physician . The purpose current protocol three-fold : 1 ) update information medical history important covariates ongoing follow-up interview cohort ; 2 ) validate self-reported disease among cohort participant duration cohort follow-up ( least 2020 ) ; 3 ) complete initial contact potential participant inform health outcome study conduct within cohort outside institution . We contact AHS cohort member complete follow-up interview allow one three mode response : self-administered paper questionnaire , self-administered web survey ( CAWI ) , interviewer-administered telephone interview ( CATI ) . We contact proxy respondent participant unable provide information . We validate variety disease interest ascertain cohort . While characteristic disease may vary , strategy disease validation similar cohort wide follow-up . Validation effort may also include request permission contact participant physician , contact physician office obtain relevant medical information . We contact proxy respondent participant unable provide information .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA : All member AHS cohort eligible Phase 3 interview eligible Phase 4 health followup . We apply eligibility criterion future cohortwide followup . Individuals complete enrollment questionnaire exclude Phase 3 eligibility . Depending upon disease outcome interest , may conduct disease confirmation validation effort protocol among participant AHS provide selfreported diagnosis interview ( e.g . Baseline , Phases 24 ) . For individual unable participate , allow proxy provide information . For validation effort , individual confirm diagnosis interest ( via self proxy report ) ask provide physician contact medical record . For specimen collection , ask proxy respondent whether individual would able provide sample . In order obtain MRR allow participant medical proxy sign form . For case cognitively impair decease , medical proxy identify . Determination cognitive impairment make report proxy interviewer conversation participant . Because AHS enrol husband wife pair , able identify appropriate proxy participant .</criteria>
