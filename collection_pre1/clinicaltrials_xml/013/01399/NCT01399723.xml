	<brief_title>Amoxicillin Versus Benzyl Penicillin Treatment Children Hospitalised With Severe Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Case management treatment childhood acute respiratory infection widely promote many develop country 20 year . Despite , pneumonia continue claim 1.5 million life child five annually . The use affordable , easily-administered , safe , effective treatment potentially reduce burden childhood pneumonia . The WHO recommend use single antibiotic treatment severe pneumonia . Whereas Asia , evidence large randomized clinical trial change policy recommendation treatment severe pneumonia parenteral penicillin oral amoxicillin , little evidence inform similar move African child pneumonia associate poor outcome . In study investigator investigate effectiveness oral amoxicillin versus current standard treatment , benzyl penicillin severe childhood pneumonia use randomize controlled non-inferiority design precede pilot pre-intervention phase . The investigator also collect observational data HIV-exposed / infect child severe pneumonia . 594 child age 2 - 59 month admit clinical sign severe pneumonia 7 hospital Kenya randomly assign receive either oral amoxicillin injectable benzyl penicillin . They follow primary outcome pre-defined treatment failure 48 hour . The result trial provide valuable data effectiveness oral amoxicillin treatment severe pneumonia population Kenyan child determine practicability conduct large pragmatic trial pneumonia Africa similar do Asia .</detailed_description>
