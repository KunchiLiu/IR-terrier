	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) common chronic paediatric rheumatic disease ( PRD ) important cause short long-term disability . Although none available drug JIA curative potential , prognosis greatly improve result substantial progress disease management . The therapeutic treatment child JIA encompass use NSAIDs intra-articular steroid injection . In patient respond NSAIDs , methotrexate ( MTX ) become disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARD ) first choice worldwide . For child respond MTX , biologic agent recently become treatment option . PATIENTS AND METHODS : 3-10 year observation study related child JIA undergo treatment MTX biologic agent follow objective : 1 . To create long-term observational registry large population prevalent incident case . 2 . Use accumulate data registry conduct ( ) pharmacovigilance/safety study ( primary endpoint ) ( ii ) estimate effectiveness ( frequency magnitude response , disease activity time inhibition slow joint erosion radiological evidence disease progression , ) , ( iii ) estimate adherence various treatment regimen . Data registry use compare safety effectiveness profile amongst patient cohort . 3 . To identify clinical laboratory predictor safety , response therapy , include remission This project retrospective ( first 3 year ) prospective component ( 10 year ) conduct participate centre 50 country belong Paediatric Rheumatology INternational Trials Organisation ( PRINTO certify ISO 9001-2008 , www.printo.it ) , Pediatric Rheumatology European Society ( PRES www.pres.org.uk ) . The main role organisation provide scientific basis current treatment paediatric rheumatic disease . The overall hypothesis test : • Biologic agent ± MTX agent able maintain acceptable safety profile long term child different JIA category achieve clinical remission prevent/stop joint erosion development time . The overall aim establish long term safety biologic agent MTX , relative effectiveness child JIA need treatment second line agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design This 3-10 year , international , multicentre , observational , safety efficacy ( response , joint erosion , damage , treatment adherence ) study aim collect prospective safety , tolerability , efficacy , treatment adherence information JIA subject expose biologic agent MTX , accord local standard practice . This non-interventional study , medicinal product prescribe per investigator 's decision . The assignment subject particular therapeutic strategy decide advance study protocol , fall within current practice prescription medicine clearly separate decision include subject study . No additional diagnostic monitoring procedure shall apply subject epidemiological method use analysis collect data . Duration treatment per investigator 's decision . The nature frequency subject ' visit investigator 's site determine investigator , accord his/her judgment basis clinical evolution subject . The duration study expect least 3 year initiation first site may continue beyond adequate funding available .</detailed_description>
