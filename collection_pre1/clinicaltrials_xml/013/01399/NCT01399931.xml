	<brief_title>Dual Point PET Scan Early Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma Patients With Bulky Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study non-interventional survey cohort patient interim PET scan perform prognostic aim . PET 18F-FDG standard stag procedure lymphoma subtypes . Performed early therapy Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) result high prognostic value main predictor treatment outcome . From 2006 onward , interim-PET 2 ABVD course increasingly perform daily clinical practice routine test disease prognosis , consider standard prognostic tool . The novelty study rely new method interim-PET scan execution : dynamic study , 2 different time point image acquisition . This could potentially enable u discriminate unspecific , inflammatory DG uptake , `` true '' uptake form persist viable neoplastic cell . Therefore , main aim study reduce false positive result interim-PET scan interpretation . Since dynamic change FDG uptake Hodgkin 's lymphoma still unknown propose , present study , assess acquisition technique pattern FDG uptake baseline untreated patient affect neoplasm . The Institutions equip Magnetic Resonance scanner diffusion weight imaging analysis technique ( DW-MRI ) , could participate DW-MRI sub-study .</detailed_description>
