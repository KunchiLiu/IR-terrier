Availability additional tissue correlative study NOT inclusion requirement . Evidence unidimensionally measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 ( Eisenhauer , Therasse et al . 2009 ) . Resolution acute toxic effect prior radiotherapy surgical procedure NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 . Adequate organ function define follow criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500/μL Platelets ≥100,000/μL Hemoglobin ≥9.0 g/dL Serum calcium ≤12.0 mg/dL Serum creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN Total serum bilirubin ≤2.0 x ULN Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [ SGPT ] ) ≤2.5 x local laboratory upper limit normal ( ULN ) , AST ALT ≤5 x ULN liver function abnormality due underlying malignancy INR ≤1.5 . ( Anticoagulation allow target INR ≤ 1.5 stable dose &gt; 2 week time study entry . ) Fasting serum cholesterol ≤300 mg/dL OR ≤7.75 mmol/L AND fast triglyceride ≤ 2.5 x ULN . NOTE : In case one threshold exceed , patient include initiation appropriate lipid lower medication . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 % . 18 year age old . Ability swallow oral medication . Signed date informed consent document indicate subject ( legally acceptable representative ) inform pertinent aspect trial prior undergo study screening procedure . Subject 's willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Patients receive prior systemic therapy RCC VEGF pathway inhibitor ( sunitinib , sorafenib , bevacizumab ) mTOR inhibitor ( sirolimus , temsirolimus , everolimus , deforolimus ) . Patients within 28 day post major surgery ( e.g. , intrathoracic , intraabdominal intrapelvic ) , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury avoid wound heal complication . Minor procedure percutaneous biopsy placement vascular access device without complication require 48 hour prior study entry . Patients radiation therapy within 28 day prior start study treatment ( palliative radiotherapy bone lesion allow complete 2 week prior study treatment start ) . Patients evidence history central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases spinal cord compression , unless prior treatment surgery radiotherapy AND progression CNS disease within 6 month prior enrollment . Patients history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior study enrollment . Patients proteinuria screen urinalysis confirm &gt; 1g /24h 24 hour urine collection . Patients inadequately control hypertension ( define blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg systolic and/or &gt; 100 mmHg diastolic medication ) , prior history hypertensive crisis hypertensive encephalopathy . Patients receive chronic systemic treatment corticosteroid ( dose ≥ 10 mg/day methylprednisone equivalent ) another immunosuppressive agent . Inhaled topical steroid acceptable . Patients known history HIV seropositivity . Patients severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition condition could affect participation study : unstable angina pectoris ( time ) , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( NYHA III , IV ) ( time ) , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia ( time ) , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident , symptomatic leave ventricular dysfunction ≤ 6 month prior first study treatment active bleeding diathesis know severely impaired lung function define spirometry DLCO ≤ 50 % normal oxygen saturation rest ≤ 88 % room air . symptomatic intrinsic lung disease require oxygen supplementation baseline Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus define HbA1c &gt; 8 % despite adequate therapy . Patients known history impair fast glucose diabetes mellitus ( DM ) may include , however blood glucose antidiabetic treatment must monitor closely throughout trial adjust necessary active ( acute chronic ) uncontrolled infection/disorders impair ability evaluate patient patient complete study liver disease cirrhosis decompensated liver disease active chronic hepatitis ( i.e . quantifiable HBVDNA and/or positive HBsAg , quantifiable HCVRNA ) . Patients history another primary malignancy treatment ≤ 3 year , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ uterine cervix . Female patient pregnant breast feed Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) , define woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective method contraception study 8 week . Highly effective contraception method include combination two following : 1 . Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception ; 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) ; 3 . Barrier method contraception : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository ; 4 . Total abstinence ; 5 . Male/female sterilization Women consider postmenopausal childbearing potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week prior randomization . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider childbearing potential . Male patient whose sexual partner ( ) WOCBP willing use adequate contraception , study 8 week end treatment Patients use investigational agent receive investigational drug ≤ 4 week prior study treatment start . Patients receive attenuated live vaccine within one week study entry . Examples live vaccine include intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella TY21a typhoid vaccine . Known intolerance hypersensitivity Everolimus rapamycin analog ( e.g . sirolimus , temsirolimus ) . Known impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral Everolimus . Patients history noncompliance medical regimen consider potentially unreliable able complete entire study</criteria>
