The key comparison Non-ETS Exposed ETS-Exposed child , difference smoke non-smoking parent positive control . Because smoke non-smoking family may differ way besides tobacco exposure , investigator obtain health history ( focus respiratory illness ) , smoke history , measure body weight , diet , responses personality test ( include susceptibility addiction ) . The investigator also obtain genomic DNA saliva sample . Genes chemosensory receptor part cough reflex pathway genotype may account aspect cough sensitivity .</brief_summary>
