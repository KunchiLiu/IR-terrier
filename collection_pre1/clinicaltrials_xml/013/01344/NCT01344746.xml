	<brief_summary>Our goal demonstrate active leukotrienes ( LTs ) mediate inflammatory response involve pathophysiology sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) , provide theoretical evidence LTs modify therapy treat pediatric patient SDB . The investigator hypothesize pathophysiology pediatric SDB involve specific systemic local upper airway inflammatory response mediate LTs . 1 . LT concentration assay reveal high level serum leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) cysteinyl leukotrienes ( CysLTs ) morning urine LTE4 SDB child , comparison healthy one , LTs production emerge disease severity-dependent increase . There positive correlation LTs production systemic marker neutrophil count high sensitive C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) . 2 . Children SDB high leukotriene receptor-1 ( LT1-R ) leukotriene receptor-2 ( LT2-R ) expression adenotonsillar tissue SDB child compare recurrent infectious tonsillitis subject . 3 . Levels LTs positively correlate body mass index ( BMI ) z-score , waist height ratio ( WHtR ) , adenotonsillar size polysomnography ( PSG ) indices include apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , obstructive apnea index ( OAI ) , oxygen desaturation index ( ODI ) , arousal index , percentage time spend saturation low 90 % ( SLT90 % ) negatively correlate mean minimal pulse oximetric saturation ( SpO2 ) , indicate synergistic role obesity hypoxia determinant LTs production SDB . 4 . In adenotonsillar mixed cell culture system , addition LTs increase cellular proliferation rate exhibit dose-dependent response , whereas leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRAs ) elicit dose-dependent cellular reduction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Leukotrienes Pathway Chinese Children With Sleep-disordered Breathing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : SDB child markedly differs see adult , particular respect clinical manifestation , PSG ( Polysomnography ) finding , treatment approach . Pediatric SDB due combination increase upper airway resistance repetitive pharyngeal collapsibility lead intermittent hypoxemia arousal sleep . It common highly prevalent disorder pediatric age , affect 4 11 % child . If leave untreated , result serious morbid consequence include cardiovascular morbidity neurocognitive dysfunction . The etiology pathophysiological mechanism lead SDB childhood clearly elucidate , may include complex interplay anatomic ( mainly adenotonsillar hypertrophy , ATH ) , neuromuscular factor underlie genetic predisposition toward disease . However , evidence identify local airway systemic inflammation also contribute pathogenesis . Among major inflammatory mediator , leukotrienes ( LTs ) class closely structurally related lipid compound derive 5-lipoxygenase pathway arachidonic acid metabolism . The LTs family include LTA4 , LTB4 LTC4/D4/E4 ( cysLTs ) , potent leukocytes chemoattractants activator . LTA4 , unstable intermediate , metabolize LTB4 cysLTs . LTC4 LTD4 short half-lives , whereas LTE4 appear stable . The effect mediator occur interaction receptor . Recent investigation western country reveal LTs may involve pathogenesis SDB , accelerate progress disease exacerbate local inflammatory response , promote proliferation upper airway lymphoid tissue . And later pediatric investigation , determine LTs production emerge disease severity-dependent increase exhale breath condensate SDB patient . Nevertheless , study investigate role LTs systemic inflammation SDB , whether LTs production independent risk factor SDB , obesity-dependent ATH -dependent risk factor SDB remain controversial . Moreover , research work China carry investigate LTs pathway large population Chinese snore child SDB . Participants : Consecutive child refer sleep center PSG due symptom SDB December 2009 June 2010 enrol study . Normal age- , sex- , weight-matched child without history snore participate control subject , recruit community-based physical check-up activity . Grouping : Five group participant form : 1 . Snoring group : 1 . Subjects snore AHI ≥ 20 episodes/h ( severe SDB ) . 2 . Snorers AHI &lt; 20 episodes/h ≥ 5 episodes/h ( moderate SDB ) 3 . Snorers AHI &lt; 5 episodes/h ≥ 1 episodes/h ( mild SDB ) 2 . Non-snoring control group : - When test serum urinal sample , healthy child without snore chosen control . - When test lymphoid tissue sample , patient recurrent infectious tonsillitis ( least five tonsillar infection less 6 month ) without snore select control surgery recruit study , adenotonsillar tissue ca n't obtain normal child obvious ethical reason . The five study group least 45 participant respectively compare regard subject ' characteristic , PSG index , metabolic inflammatory variable . Statistical Methods : 1 . Data present mean ± SD median ( interquartile range ) depend distribution unless state otherwise . PSG index , hsCRP value LT concentration log-transformed ( natural logarithm ) SpO2 logit-transformed correct skew distribution . 2 . One-way analysis variance follow post hoc test pair comparison ( Bonferroni test ) use continuous variable X2 test ( Yates correction ) categorical characteristic . If data ca n't transform approach normal distribution , Kruskal-Wallis test follow nonparametric Bonferroni multiple comparison test apply . 3 . Correlations analyze without adjustment use Pearson correlation spearman rank test depend data distribution . Partial correlation apply assess linear association LTs concentration systemic inflammatory mark PSG index adjustment covariates include age , glucose , lipid , BMI z-score . 4 . Stepwise multiple regression perform identify independent predictor LTs production . 5 . All statistical analysis conduct use statistical software ( version 16.0 ; SPSS , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Using Dunnett 's test , two-tailed p value &lt; 0.01 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects age 2 12 year ( 2 year ≤ subject ' age ≤ 12 year ) . Subjects presence habitual snoring ( snore report parent &gt; 3 nights/week ) his/her history habitual snoring least 3 month could recruit snore group . Subjects n't history snoring could recruit control subject Subjects cardiovascular , neuromuscular , craniofacial genetic disorder ; acute chronic inflammation disease , e.g . asthma , allergic rhinitis allergy . Subjects receive pharmacologic treatment include antibiotic , aspirin , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug , corticosteroid , LTRAs within last 1 month . Subjects already undergone T &amp; A past . Subjects receive oral appliance CPAP ( Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ) treatment .</criteria>
