	<brief_summary>To study clinically stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) patient muscle atrophy : 1 . The short-term effect 4 month exercise train include nutritional supplementation versus exercise train alone physical functioning ( skeletal muscle strength exercise capacity ) body composition . 2 . The long-term effect 4 month exercise train nutritional supplementation follow 8 month nutritional counseling ( supplementation advice ) feedback physical activity level versus 4 month exercise train 8 month feedback physical activity level alone physical functioning , body composition cardiometabolic risk profile ; 3 . The cost-effectiveness exercise rehabilitation nutritional intervention versus exercise rehabilitation alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutritional Rehabilitation Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Patients With Muscle Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale . Recent guideline state pulmonary rehabilitation part integrate care patient COPD limit end stage disease . The investigator hypothesize clinically stable COPD patient muscle atrophy , irrespective severity airflow obstruction , show pronounce long-term improvement physical functioning cardiometabolic risk profile rehabilitation programme include nutritional intervention ( supplementation counsel ) pulmonary rehabilitation programme without nutritional intervention , acceptable cost . Nutritional supplementation focus enhance efficacy exercise training . Nutritional counseling aim maintain energy balance modulate cardiovascular disease risk . Study design . The research aim address multi-centre , randomize , clinical trial . Phase A , Rehabilitation ( 4 month ) : - Group 1 : Supervised exercise train 3 placebo nutritional supplement daily - Group 2 : Supervised exercise train 3 nutritional supplement daily Phase B , Maintenance ( 8 month ) : - Group 1 : Exercise counseling ( 2x ) - Group 2 : Exercise counseling ( 2x ) , nutritional counseling ( 5x ) ( 1 nutritional supplement day indication ) Phase C , Follow-up ( 3 month ) : - Group 1 : intervention - Group 2 : 1 nutritional supplement day request Nature extent burden risk associate participation benefit . This study aim tailor pulmonary rehabilitation . Participants group 1 visit rehabilitation centre 3 time study related measurement within 15 month ( 2 time feedback physical activity , 1 measurement visit ) . Participants group 2 ask visit rehabilitation centre 6 time ( 1 measurement visit , 3 time nutritional counseling , 1 time feedback physical activity , 1 time nutritional counseling feedback physical activity combine ) within 15 month . For group baseline measurement outcome measurement rehabilitation already include CIRO rehabilitation programme .</detailed_description>
