	<brief_summary>There preliminary evidence suggest early surgical treatment hip fracture may improve patient ' outcome . The investigator propose pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) ass feasibility large RCT comparing accelerate surgical repair ( i.e . surgery within 6 hour hip fracture diagnosis ) versus standard care ( typically surgery 36-48 hour ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HIP Fracture Accelerated Surgical TreaTment And Care tracK ( HIP ATTACK ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture devastate consequence : 30-day mortality rate men 9 % woman 5 % , risk disability substantial . Even among patient community-dwelling prior hip fracture , 11 % bed-ridden 16 % long-term care facility one year . The trauma associate hip fracture result pain , bleeding , immobility . These factor initiate inflammatory , hypercoaguable , stress , catabolic state cause medical complication , include death . Proposed mechanism increase mortality morbidity associate delayed surgery include 1 ) complication relate protracted immobilization ( e.g . venous thromboembolism , atelectasis pneumonia , urinary tract infection , pressure ulcer , muscle mass loss ) 2 ) increase cardiovascular event . Delay surgery may result protracted immobility associate complication , well prolonged exposure hypercoagulable-inflammatory-sympathetic state may increase cardiovascular event . Observational data suggest mechanism indeed important : delayed surgical repair associate increased mortality morbidity hip fracture . A systematic review meta-analysis observational study address impact timing surgery outcome hip fracture . Five study report adjusted measure mortality . The pooled estimate , base 721 death 4,208 patient , suggest early surgical treatment ( i.e . within cut-off individual study ) hip fracture associate significant reduction mortality ( adjust risk ratio [ RR ] 0.81 , 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] 0.68-0.96 ) . It possible observational data substantially underestimate real potential early surgery . The reason `` early surgery '' study occur within 24 , 48 72 hour . If surgery could uniformly undertake within 6 hour , give potential benefit earlier mobilization minimization period inflammatory hypercoagulable state , benefit might substantially great . The substantial impact treatment acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) stroke within hour add credence possibility . Despite evidence , possibility large effect might result even early surgery , current data support weak inference . The evidence rely observational data therefore susceptible residual confounding . The strength inference current evidence lay sufficient solid base justify substantial system modification require facilitate accelerated surgical access hip fracture patient . The main factor cause surgical delay hip fracture : 1 ) patient present comorbidities surgery defer preoperative diagnostics , risk stratification , medical optimization ( `` medical clearance '' ) 2 ) surgical operating room staff resource available hip fracture low priority urgent surgery list ( `` queue '' ) . Both medical clearance queue modifiable issue - address obstacle potential substantially reduce surgical wait time . Our ultimate goal undertake large multicentre randomize control trial ( RCT ) accelerate surgical care ( i.e. , goal surgery within 6 hour diagnosis ) versus usual timing surgery among elderly adult diagnose hip fracture . This protocol pilot RCT inform feasibility undertake large RCT .</detailed_description>
