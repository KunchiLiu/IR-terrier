	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . It yet know whether surgery effective without radiation therapy treat nonmetastatic retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy follow surgery see well work compare surgery alone treat patient previously untreated nonmetastatic retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgery With Without Radiation Therapy Untreated Nonmetastatic Retroperitoneal Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess whether difference abdominal recurrence-free survival retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma patient undergo curative intent surgery alone undergoing preoperative radiotherapy follow curative-intent surgery . Secondary - To assess whether difference metastasis-free survival , abdominal recurrence-free interval , overall survival patient . - To assess tumor response patient undergo preoperative radiotherapy . - To assess toxicity preoperative radiotherapy give prior curative-intent surgery patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord institution WHO performance status ( 0-1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo surgical resection tumor mass within 4 week follow randomization . - Arm II : Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( RT ) intensity-modulated RT within 8 week randomization . RT continue 5 day week approximately 5.5 week . Patients undergo surgical resection tumor mass within 4-8 week completion RT . Tumor tissue , normal abdominal wall fat , peripheral blood may collect surgery identify new prognostic factor translational research . After completion study therapy , patient follow day 60 post-surgery every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
