	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND A Cochrane review 2003 find 30 % people 65 year old year fall number even high elder people live institution . Falls cause 95 % hip fracture , result prolonged hospitalization prolong disability . Half elderly incurs hip fracture never able walk like fall , one year mortality 15 25 % . Meanwhile , population 65 year old old increase National Institute Aging note 2001 report world 's population 65 year old old grow 800.000 year . It estimate cost fall-related accident 2020 reach $ 54.9 billion U.S. alone . In patient referred emergency room unexplained fall , study 564 patient show 80 % patient vestibular symptom characterize balance problem , nausea , impairment , vomit , dizziness . 41 % patient dizziness suggest dysfunctional vestibular system call vestibular dysfunction . A study 6785 participant include National Health Nutrition Examination Surveys U.S. show prevalence vestibular dysfunction increase significantly age . The prevalence vestibular dysfunction among participant age 60-69 year 49.4 % , 68,7 % among participant age 70-79 84,8 % participant age 80 year old . In patient vestibular dysfunction , vestibular rehabilitation ( VR ) reduce fall risk . In 2007 large Cochrane review compare randomized study VR , author conclude moderate strong evidence efficacy VR . Several author describe reduction patient 's dizziness VR achieve simultaneous establishment daily exercise home . Several study show however elderly decrease compliance relation performance home exercise . A solution support old vestibular rehabilitation process maintain achieve level functionality rehabilitation process computer-training program `` Move It To Improve It '' ( MITII ) . The program successfully use home training patient cerebral palsy compose exercise motivate guide . Based individual study test therapist develop personalized rehabilitation program permanently correct , modify adjust vestibular dysfunction patient . The system could generate feedback therapist hospital information person 's daily training time . Basic element MITII exercise . As example exercise could catch insect net use head movement . Management method drag-and-drop , mean management network do user colour retain move object screen . PURPOSE The study consist three study purpose : To compare computer exercise program ( Mitii ) conservative home-training accord printed instruction rehabilitation patient vistibular dysfunction outpatient clinic To investigate whether effect vestibular rehabilitation preserve three month completion supervise training outpatient clinic specific vestibular rehabilitation whether computer assist home training program ( Mitii ) superior print instruction respect To evaluate patient experience barrier use fo computer assist rehabilitation patient vestibular dysfunction METHODS The study consist three part : 1 . A randomized study aim examine whether Mitii improve outcome vestibular rehabilitation.The study include 31 patient control 32 patient intervention group vestibular dysfunction . The control group undergo normal rehabilitation fall clinic ( ie , 2 time weekly rehabilitation fall clinic + home exercise program print instruction ) intervention group undergo rehabilitation MITII ( ie 2 time weekly rehabilitation fall clinic + MITII support home exercise . The expectation intervention group improve . 2 . After completion rehabilitation period patient must maintain functionality home exercise . The patient intervention group keep MITII 12 week compare control group patient traditional exercise program print instruction available . The expectation intervention group able maintain functionality best . 3 . The last part study qualitative study elderly feel use IT support home . This qualitative study consist interview 7 patient included intervention group . STUDY POPULATION Patients refer fall clinic GP Casualty department , Aarhus University Hospital . A geriatric doctor examine evaluate underlies patient 's fall issue . The patient diagnose vestibular dysfunction accept take part project , refers Ear , nose throat department H , Aarhus University Hospital verification vestibular dysfunction .</detailed_description>
