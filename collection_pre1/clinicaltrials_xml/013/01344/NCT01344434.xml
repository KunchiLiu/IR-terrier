	<brief_summary>This study hypothesize renal transplantation candidate diagnose significant Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD ) equal non-invasive modality invasive modality . Therefore investigator investigate ability coronary compute tomographic angiography ( cCTA ) , myocardial perfusion scintigraphy ( MPS ) , acoustic CAD Patch combination hereof detect CAD define invasive Coronary angiography ( CAG ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease know risk factor cardiovascular disease cardiovascular disease lead cause mortality end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient . After renal transplantation one-half death cardiac , usually first 5 year presence functional graft . Because renal transplantation candidate undergoing cardiac pre-transplant risk stratification . There consensus regard modality use detection CAD cardiac pre-transplant risk stratification . CAG know gold standard invasive procedure risk complication . The investigator wish investigate ability detect CAD define invasive Coronary angiography ( CAG ) clinical examination , blood test non-invasive test ( cCTA , MPS acoustic CAD Patch ) . The investigator hypothesize single modality combination high sensitivity specificity could diagnose significant CAD without need invasive procedure . This study include 150 renal transplantation candidate .</detailed_description>
