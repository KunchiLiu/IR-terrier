	<brief_summary>Vascular access via central venous line ( CVL ) essential care many patient intensive care set . While value line management critically ill patient generally accept , potential line-associated blood stream infection know complication use intervention . Ethanol effective antimicrobial agent activity broad spectrum human pathogen . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness daily treatment catheter lumen ethanol prevent central line associate blood stream infection ( CLABSI ) . The hypothesis treatment reduce incidence CLABSI compare maintenance line normal saline alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood stream infection important complication use central venous line ( CVLs ) result increase morbidity , mortality , cost . Blood stream infection relate CVLs may result migration skin organism along catheter tract introduction organism lumen catheter . The extraluminal route infection appear common early catheter insertion frequency infection acquire intraluminal route appear increase longer catheter place . Meticulous attention best practice insertion subsequent care insertion site reduces infection extraluminal route . Adherence good technique enter line may similarly reduce infection intraluminal route . Ethanol effective antimicrobial agent activity broad spectrum human pathogen ; include bacteria fungi commonly infect CVLs . The mechanism antimicrobial activity ethanol attribute ability denature proteins induced resistance effect ethanol report . These feature suggest ethanol-lock promising approach prevention acquisition central line associate blood stream infection intraluminal route .</detailed_description>
