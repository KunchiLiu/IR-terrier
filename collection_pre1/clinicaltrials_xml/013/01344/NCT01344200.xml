	<brief_summary>Background : Celecoxib effective reduce postoperative pain adult . Children use celecoxib rapidly adult require high dos . Celecoxib partially metabolize liver certain enzyme . A person 's genetic variation enzyme influence well body use Celecoxib . Understanding blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) profile celecoxib child influence genetics metabolism would help develop appropriate celecoxib dose child various treatment option . Objective ( ) Hypothesis : Our primary objective create pediatric profile celecoxib blood central nervous system well explore relationship CYP2C9 polymorphism document adverse event The investigator hypothesize CSF concentration Celecoxib post dose lower plasma level , take long reach peak concentration directly relate dose , genetics , age . The investigator expect Celecoxib improve quality life reduce discomfort administer lumbar puncture bone marrow aspirate . Potential Impact : The result study establish safety celecoxib child well help u define best dose acute pain . It may also help reduce incidence acute pain evolve chronic pain . Finally , may provide insight celecoxib 's future use chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Celecoxib selective cyclooxygenase-2 ( Cox-2 ) inhibitor belong non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) class medication . Adult study evaluate single dose short term course Celecoxib show improved postoperative analgesia . One pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study suggest celecoxib fast clearance pediatric patient imply need high dose child . Adult literature report Cox-2 inhibitor administration 10 time typical dose without adverse side effect . One adult chemotherapy drug trial involve high dose Celecoxib median 8.4 month limited side effect . Another study demonstrate blood brain barrier ( BBB ) permeable selective Cox-2 inhibitor effectively reduced central nervous system Prostaglandin ( PG ) E2 , ( surrogate marker Cox-2 activity ) concentration postoperative pain . Genotypic variability CYP2C9 liver enzymes implicate altered PK celecoxib human . Understanding blood CSF pharmacokinetics celecoxib child influence genetics metabolism would aid development appropriate celecoxib dose schedule various pain model . At institution , child diagnose hematologic malignancy routinely undergo general anesthesia bone marrow aspiration/biopsy ( BM ) diagnostic/ therapeutic lumbar puncture ( LP ) . Post intervention site pain may associate post dural puncture atypical headache . Recently report elevate Cox-2 expression patient CML lymphoma . Data suggest combination Cox-2 inhibitor standard chemotherapeutics may enhance potential treatment hematological malignancy . Access blood cerebral spinal fluid provide unique opportunity determine celecoxib concentration respective compartment . Objectives Hypothesis : Our primary objective create pediatric pharmacokinetic profile celecoxib blood central nervous system well explore relationship CYP2C9 polymorphism document adverse event . The investigator hypothesize CSF concentration Celecoxib post ingestion lower plasma level delay peak concentration directly relate dose , genotype , age . The investigator expect Celecoxib improve quality life reduce discomfort administer LP +/- BM . Experimental Design The study consist two prospective cohort arm . A dose timing cohort develop pharmacokinetic profile blood CSF concentration , dose escalation cohort increase dos celecoxib suspension administer . A single blood sample determine CYP2C9 alleles draw patient upon study entry . Potential Impact : CSF penetration Cox-2 inhibitor may reduce incidence acute pain evolve chronic pain model . The result study establish safety class medication child enable rational approach dose acute pain model perhaps future chemotherapeutic protocol</detailed_description>
