	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Pemetrexed disodium may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth non-small cell lung cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving carboplatin pemetrexed disodium together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give carboplatin pemetrexed disodium together bevacizumab work treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer light never smoker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin , Pemetrexed Disodium , Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Who Are Light Never Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient advance non-small cell lung cancer never light smoker treat carboplatin , pemetrexed disodium , bevacizumab follow pemetrexed disodium bevacizumab maintenance therapy . Secondary - To estimate overall survival ( OS ) patient treat regimen . - To estimate toxicity treatment use NCI CTCAE version 3.0 . - To conduct exploratory analysis molecular marker ( e.g. , KRAS EGFR mutation ) patient never light smoke history analyze potential association response , PFS , OS . - To assess response second-line erlotinib hydrochloride therapy accord RECIST criterion . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - First-line therapy : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute , carboplatin IV 30 minute , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve partial complete response stable disease progress maintenance therapy . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute bevacizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience disease progression unacceptable toxicity may receive second-line therapy erlotinib hydrochloride part standard-of-care treatment . Tissue sample collect baseline laboratory biomarker analysis . After completion maintenance therapy , patient follow every 4 week 2 month .</detailed_description>
