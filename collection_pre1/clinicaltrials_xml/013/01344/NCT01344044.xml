	<brief_summary>This study aim examine efficacy brain-computer interface system treatment inattentive symptom Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) . The investigator hypothesis child ADHD receive treatment BCI-based training improve great extent control group . Additionally , investigator also conduct fMRI study involve interested participant , elucidate neural mechanism underlie behavioural improvement . This necessary help investigator gain good picture brain correlate related ADHD understand intervention affect brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain-Computer Interface ( BCI ) Based Intervention Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This BCI study involve 2 phase . The first phase preliminary study test safety effectiveness novel BCI device involve newly develop dry electrode sensor intervention game . Twenty child , age 6-12 diagnosed Inattentive Combined subtype ADHD recruit study . This open-label , experimental arm go 8 week BCI intervention . The second phase randomize control trial involve 160 child . They randomize treatment control arm . The treatment arm receive 8 week BCI intervention , similar experimental arm . The group serve wait-list control . The fMRI trial aim examine underlie neural process explain therapeutic effect may see . The study enroll 70 child ADHD , age 6-12 , participate main randomize controlled trial : 40 BrainpalTM intervention group 30 control group ; participant undergo fMRI scan Week 0 8 Week 8 16 . The study recruit another 30 child age 6-12 community healthy control group , undergo imaging procedure . The scan involve functional structural imaging .</detailed_description>
