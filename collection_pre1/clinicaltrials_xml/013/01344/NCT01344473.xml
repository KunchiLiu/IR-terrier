	<brief_summary>Fixed dental brace associate risk develop White Spot Lesions ( WSLs ) , appear white chalky mark teeth . They develop result acid produce bacteria dental plaque dissolve out surface tooth , know demineralisation . Recently , amorphous calcium phosphate ( ACP ) stabilise casein phosphopeptide ( CPP ) become available , report help rebuild surface teeth WSLs . CPP-ACP available incorporated crème know Tooth Mousse ( TM ) . While appear sufficient evidence regard use CPP-ACP promote general remineralisation , first time study aim examine use CPP-ACP treat WSLs post-orthodontic participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Tooth Mousse Remineralise Post-orthodontic Treatment White Spot Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study run Orthodontic department Dundee Dental School Perth Royal Infirmary , NHS Tayside . The investigator recruit total 80 participant study . Clinicians within orthodontic department determine patient could potential participant study , one visit prior debonding brace , treat clinician discus study potential participant . If interested finding , clinician issue potential participant appropriate PIL . There PIL potential participant sixteen year old , separate PILs age twelve sixteen year old , twelve year old , parents/guardians potential participant sixteen year old.. The clinician inform PI/SI PIL support documentation issue . There potential participant referral form , complete aid transfer information PI/SI . Potential participant twelve year old advise parent guardian must attend debond appointment , write informed consent ( IC ) seek parents/guardians Investigators study . Once IC obtain , rest stimulate salivary flow rate measure Investigators delegate member research team use Saliva-Check Buffer kit ( GC Corp , Leuven , Belgium ) . The kit allow observation quantity viscosity rest saliva produce one minute , pH sample also test record . Participants chew piece paraffin wax two-minute period produce stimulate salivary sample . The liquid component sample measure allow flow rate ml/minute calculate , pH test record . The buffering capacity stimulate saliva also determine challenge saliva vary amount lactic acid . As lack saliva would bias result study due increase caries risk , saliva essential hydrolysis CPP-ACP TM , rest salivary flow rate 0.2ml/min , stimulate rate 1.0ml/min , subject exclude study . Participants randomly allocate control experimental group . Each subject include study WSLs assess categorise clinically use International Caries Detection Assessment System , ( ICDASii ) ( International Caries Detection Assessment System Coordinating Committee , 2009a ) , ICDASii calibrate examiner . Examiner reliability determine score extract teeth teeth validate histology . Reproducibility measure use Kappa score . All lesion buccal surface teeth include study . Intra-oral digital photograph also take participant reproducible manner , photograph analyse two different blind ICDASii calibrate examiner , recruit study simply score clinical photograph . A colour standard ( CasMaTCH ; Bear medic , Tokyo ) use allow colour matching image . The experimental group receive TM crème use daily . The oral write instruction regard crème application provide , indicate crème apply surface teeth , agitate ( swish ) one minute retainer place night-time wear per crème application protocol . Subjects control group use crème retainer , simply ask place retainer night-time wear . At commencement study record long participant fix appliance situ , participant clinician receive questionnaire determine fluoride use , oral hygiene regime , diet preventive intervention e.g . visit hygienist , topical fluoride application , fix appliance treatment . The participant dental record review record pre-existing developmental defect enamel WSLs document . Participants ask score perception appearance teeth , consider presence WSLs , use validate Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) . Participants review 6 week 12 week . At visit WSLs reassess categorise calibrated examiner ( PI/SI ) use ICDASii . Digital photograph retaken analysis blind , calibrate examiner appropriate , participant ask bring tube unused crème weigh help determine compliance study protocol . A decision make issue subject diary determine compliance evidence Orthodontic literature n't find self-reporting type , area reliable . Participants ask score appearance teeth use VAS subject experimental group complete questionnaire acceptability , taste convenience use crème . A transition matrix incorporate ICDASii severity activity score use assess stability , regression progression WSLs baseline follow-up examination .</detailed_description>
