	<brief_title>The Effects Stainless Steel Suture MGH Flexor Tendon Repair Coupled With Early Aggressive Range Motion Rehabilitation : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study serve pilot-study future randomize control trial . Adult patient zone 2 flexor tendon laceration hand ( anatomically A1 pulley hand insertion flexor digitorum superficialis ) present emergency room acutely ( within 1 week injury ) Health Sciences Center Winnipeg ask participation study . Consent obtain plastic surgery resident either emergency room plastic surgency emergency decant clinic . The investigator include twenty-four patient study , randomize one two treatment group ( group A B ) block randomization . Randomization do patient agree participate study . All patient book surgery emergency slate . Each treatment group treat single surgeon expert treatment injury . Group A patient laceration ( ) repair use modify Becker repair technique use stainless steel suture operate room , proceed undergo aggressive early active range motion rehabilitation administer hand therapist HSC . Group B patient undergo double-locking loop suture repair use polypropylene . They undergo less aggressive active range motion rehabilitation protocol currently offer patient center . Follow-up occur plastic surgery outpatient clinic post-operative week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 12 . Follow-up hand therapy discretion therapist . At visit hand therapy , joint range motion assess PIP DIP joint affect finger . Final range motion assess use Strickland system evaluate flexor tendon surgery outcomes , do blind hand therapist .</detailed_description>
