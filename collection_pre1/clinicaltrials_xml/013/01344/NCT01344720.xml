	<brief_summary>This randomize , single-blind , parallel-group study investigate efficacy tolerability combination treatment etoricoxib ( 30 mg/day ) plus controlled-release oxycodone ( 10 mg/day ) compare titrate dose etoricoxib 60mg/day monotherapy , patient Chronic Low Back Pain ( CLBP ) respond start dose Etoricoxib 30mg/day . A common clinical question well increase dose current monotherapy combine treatment early , patient respond standard start dose NSAIDs like etoricoxib .</brief_summary>

Achieve least 3 consecutive day average daily pain score &gt; 4 baseline week ( visit 1 visit 2 ) via patient diary recording . Patient currently receive treatment CLBP receive treatment CLBP , drug etoricoxib oxycodone , complete require washout prior Visit 2 . Patient never receive treatment etoricoxib oxycodone strong opioids . No assumption adjuvant drug ( antiepileptic , steroid , tricyclic antidepressant , SNRIs , muscle relaxant ) last month ( two week ) . Patient level understanding sufficient provide write informed consent communicate investigator site personnel . Patient judge reliable , agree keep appointment clinic visit , agree participate record response questionnaires instrument use study , well protocol procedure . All female childbearing potential must test negative pregnancy Visit 1 , base serum pregnancy test . Females childbearing potential ( surgically sterilise menarche 1 year postmenopause ) must agree use medically acceptable reliable mean birth control ( determined investigator ) study 1 month follow last dose study drug . Examples reliable method include use oral contraceptive Depo Provera Contraceptive Injection , abstinence , partner vasectomy , diaphragm contraceptive jelly , condom contraceptive foam , intrauterine device . Have know hypersensitivity NSAIDs strong opioids inactive ingredient contraindication use etoricoxib oxycodone : Patient hypersensitivity opioid analgesic ; acute asthma obstructive airway disease acute respiratory depression hypoxia ; elevate carbon dioxide level blood ; cor pulmonale ; acute alcoholism ; delirium tremens ; severe CNS depression ; convulsive disorder ; increase cerebrospinal intracranial pressure ; head injury ; suspect surgical abdomen ( paralytic ileus ) ; concomitant MAO inhibitor ( within 14 day therapy ) . Hypersensitivity active substance excipients etoricoxib formulation . Active peptic ulceration active gastrointestinal ( GI ) bleeding . Patients experience bronchospasm , acute rhinitis , nasal polyp , angioneurotic oedema , urticaria , allergictype reaction take acetylsalicylic acid NSAIDs include COX2 ( cyclooxygenase2 ) inhibitor . Pregnancy lactation Severe hepatic dysfunction ( serum albumin &lt; 25 g/l ChildPugh score â‰¥10 ) . Estimated renal creatinine clearance &lt; 30 ml/min . Inflammatory bowel disease . Congestive heart failure ( NYHA IIIV ) . Patients hypertension whose blood pressure persistently elevate 140/90mmHg adequately control . Established ischaemic heart disease , peripheral arterial disease , and/or cerebrovascular disease . Have previously complete withdrawn study study investigate etoricoxib oxycodone previously treat etoricoxib oxycodone . Have history substance abuse dependence within past year , exclude nicotine caffeine . Have positive urine drug screen substance abuse . Women breastfeed . Have historical exposure drug know cause neuropathy ( example , vincristine ) , history medical condition , include pernicious anaemia hypothyroidism , could responsible neuropathy . Have pain clearly differentiated condition interfere assessment CLBP . Examples painful condition could confuse like peripheral vascular disease ( ischemic pain ) ; neurological disorder ( example , phantom limb pain amputation ) ; skin condition area neuropathy could alter sensation ( example , plantar ulcer ) ; painful condition ( example , arthritis , neoplasm , fibromyalgia , CRPS ) . Have history neurosurgical procedure pain control , nerve/plexus bloc ablation within 6 month prior screen . Psychological condition , opinion investigator , would compromise participation likely require hospitalization course study .</criteria>
