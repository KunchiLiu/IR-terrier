	<criteria>1 . Confirmed diagnosis LGMD 2C include : Molecular analysis prove del525T mutation γsarcoglycan gene ( chromosome 13 ) homozygous state Muscle biopsy immunohistochemical and/or Western blot analysis show marked decrease absence γsarcoglycan staining muscle , well fibrosis assessment available . If , initial muscular biopsy may perform preenrollment period 2 . Lower age limit 15 year 3 . Males female may equally enrol 4 . Adequate carpus radialis muscle bulk muscle biopsy assess examination . Subjects able communicate investigation staff . They able understand , comply perform need evaluation trial period , include muscle strength test . Forearm muscle strength least 3+ assessed British Medical Research Council ( MRC ) Manual Muscle Testing ( MMT ) scale . Subjects also already lose ambulation 5 .
