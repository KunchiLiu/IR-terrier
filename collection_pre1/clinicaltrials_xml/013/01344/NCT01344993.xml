	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Sub-retinal Transplantation hESC Derived RPE ( MA09-hRPE ) Cells Patients With Advanced Dry Age Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase I/II , open-label , non randomize , sequential , multi-center clinical trial . There 5 cohort , 4 low vision cohort contain 3 patient , good vision cohort contain 4 patient . The enrolled cohort follow : Three AMD patients- 50,000 MA09-hRPE cell transplant Three AMD patients- 100,000 MA09-hRPE cell transplant Four Better Vision AMD patients- 100,000 MA09-hRPE cell transplant Three AMD patients- 150,000 MA09-hRPE cell transplant Three AMD patients- 200,000 MA09-hRPE cell transplant Patients enrol sequentially , within cohort 3 patient , patient 's clinical course first 6 week follow cell transplantation review independent ( DSMB ) enrollment open next 2 patient . A full safety assessment 3 patient cohort make DSMB 3rd patient cohort complete 4 week follow-up , first patient next cohort receive cell transplant . The exception good vision group patient may enrol DSMB approval receive . Each cohort enrol sequentially turn , exception well vision cohort may enrol parallel cohort . The day cell implantation Day 0 , patient remain study last visit 12 month .</detailed_description>
