	<criteria>Male female subject , age 18 year old Any following : Known suspect supraaortic arterial disease base : Prior stroke Transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) Amaurosis Fugax ( transient monocular blindness ) Referred evaluation supraaortic vessel ( clinically significant stenosis ) Followup stent supraaortic vessel Prior imaging study ( CTA ultrasound ) show ≥ 50 % stenosis supraaortic vessel segment ( within 60 day consent ) . The proportion subject positive disease ( determined investigator , base CTA ultrasound ) monitor study , enrolment may restrict require ≥ 70 % stenosis ensure overall adequate number subject clinically significant disease evaluation study endpoint . Willingness undergo routine Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Angiography [ CE MRA ] examination gadobutrol Willingness ability follow direction complete study procedure specify protocol Females childbearing potential : Negative pregnancy test day MRA administration study drug Pregnant nursing ( include pump storage feeding ) Received investigational product participation clinical trial within 30 day enrollment study Previous enrollment study Bayer sponsor study use gadobutrol Contraindication MRA examination ( e.g . inability hold breath ; severe arrhythmia ; low cardiac output , severe claustrophobia , defibrillator metallic device approve MRI ) Contraindication use Gdcontaining contrast agent ( include subject suspicion know Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis [ NSF ] ) History severe allergic anaphylactoid reaction allergen include drug contrast agent Received contrast agent within 72 hour study MRA , schedule receipt contrast agent within 24 hour study MRA ( Note : This applies also CTA potentially schedule course study . ) Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) value &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 derive serum creatinine result within 2 week gadobutrol injection . Any subject hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis exclude participation . Use value obtain prior close time MRA , multiple creatinine value . ( Do use core lab value available prior MRA . ) Acute renal insufficiency intensity , either due hepatorenal syndrome occur perioperative liver transplantation period Severe cardiovascular disease ( e.g . acute myocardial infarction [ &lt; 14 day ] , unstable angina , congestive heart failure New York Heart Association class IV ) know long QT syndrome Suspected clinical instability unpredictability clinical course study period ( e.g . due previous surgery ) Scheduled potentially expect period CTA gadobutrol MRA : Any procedure may alter MRA CTA interpretation , Any interventional surgical procedure involve supraaortic vessel</criteria>
