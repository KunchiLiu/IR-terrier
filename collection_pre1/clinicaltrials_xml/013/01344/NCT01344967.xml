	<brief_summary>Bone common site spread breast cancer bone metastases occur roughly 70 % woman advance disease . These patient risk develop bone complication cause significant impact patient morbidity mortality . Close two-thirds woman bone metastasis go develop least one complication , term skeletal related event ( SRE ) , define 1 ) pathological fracture , 2 ) pain require radiation surgical intervention , 3 ) spinal cord compression , 4 ) hypercalcemia . In addition SREs , breast cancer patient bone metastasis degree pain associate disease . Understandably factor negatively impact quality life . Furthermore , development SRE population show associated short overall survival . Prevention delay onset complication therefore important therapeutic goal .</brief_summary>
