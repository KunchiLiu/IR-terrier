	<brief_summary>In Gaucher disease type I bleed common presenting symptom , may manifest frequent nose bleeds , easy bruising also cause substantial bleed surgical dental procedure may occur association pregnancy delivery . The bleeding tendency usually consider secondary thrombocytopenia However 50,000 platelet enough healthy people give normal bleeding time associate significant bleeding tendency Gaucher patient . Bleeding tendency might attribute genetic inherit Gaucher related coagulation factor abnormalities case stabilize ERT . However , In case etiology abnormality platelet function . This thrombocytopathy delineated apart aggregation study , systematic analysis publish convincingly show cause disturbed function . While , experience show enzyme replacement ( ERT , i.e : imiglucerase , CerezymeÂ® ) reduce bleeding tendency , part due improvement thrombocyte count elevation coagulation factor , less clear effect ERT thrombocytopathy . This clinical significance patient need prepared surgery delivery event major bleed . There consensus patient prepare treated . Different centre use different approach . When procedure elective ERT appropriate situation DDAVP , fresh frozen plasma platelet infusion possible treatment . Even activate factor VII use bleed control . As coagulation abnormality , treatment tailor specific cause bleeding diathesis . The aim study define etiology platelet dysfunction Gaucher patient . Hypothesis : The investigator expect see difference platelet activation profile among imiglucerase treat untreated patient least partial restoration platelet function due treatment commencement .</brief_summary>
