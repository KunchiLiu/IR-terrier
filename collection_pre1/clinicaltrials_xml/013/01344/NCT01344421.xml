	<detailed_description>Congenital hip dysplasia disease characterise pathological change hip joint . Hip dysplasia normal disease prevalence 4.3 % men 3.6 woman . Untreated hip dysplasia know cause develop osteoarthritis early life symptom pain , hip instability together change gait pattern normal . Symptomatic hip dysplasia see patient 15 55 year unilateral well bilateral . Causes hip dysplasia describe genetic , mechanic hormonal . Today patient hip dysplasia offer hip conserve surgery osteoarthritis develop . In 2003 minimally invasive approach periacetabular osteotomy ( PAO ) introduce Aarhus University Hospital . An advantage minimally invasive approach compare classical Bernese periacetabular osteotomy minimal impact soft tissue hip region . Hip pain activity limitation highly affect quality life physical function . The gait distance reduce patient compensate relieve pressure hip joint . Knowledge dynamic gait run pattern patient dysplasia important understand consequence dysplastic hip joint . Furthermore knowledge gait compensation relevant clinicians management treatment patient hip dysplasia . Today , gait run compensation unknown minimally invasive approach The purpose study , therefore , examine movement pattern patient hip dysplasia preoperative , six 12 month minimally invasive approach Peri-acetabular osteotomy ( PAO ) . Secondary examine movement pattern patient compare healthy control historical data .</detailed_description>
