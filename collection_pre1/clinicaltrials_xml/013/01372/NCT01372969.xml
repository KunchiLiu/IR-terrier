	<brief_title>Study Assess Safety Efficacy Expanded Allogenic Adipose-derived Stem Cells ( eASCs ) ( Cx601 ) , Treatment Complex Perianal Fistulas Perianal Crohn 's Disease .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn´s disease ( CD ) severe disorder significant morbidity major impact life . CD affect part digestive system symptoms chronic illness include abdominal pain , bloating , nausea , vomit diarrhea . CD also cause bowel wall ulcer , stricture ( narrow hollow structure due scar tissue swell ) , fistula ( abnormal passage intestines another organ skin ) . There unmet need effective medical therapy CD patient perianal fistula , respond conventional strategy , include biological therapy . The current study design assess safety efficacy adipose tissue derive mesenchymal stem cell healthy donor treatment perianal fistula patient present CD . Primary objective : To assess safety ( incidence treatment emergent adverse-events ) eASCs . Study design : Multicenter , pilot study , assess safety evaluation efficacy two Gastroenterologists/Surgeons independent external radiologist . Subjects receive cell suspension allogenic adipose-derived stem cell , eASCs ( 20 million cell ) fistula . In case incomplete fistula closure treat fistula week 12 , subject receive second dose eASCs ( 40 million cell ) . Subjects follow week 24 , follow initial administration cell . Subjects may treat standard care entire study period , accord investigator discretion , exclude infliximab anti-TNF , tacrolimus cyclosporine . . Study population : In total 24 patient , men woman least 18 year age , perianal CD recruit . Patients minimum one maximum three fistula tract . Description treatment : . Subjects receive : Investigational product : CX-601 Suspension adult expand allogenic adipose-derived stem cell ( eASCs ) dose 20 million cell 40 million cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent . Subjects Crohn 's disease diagnose least 12 month early accordance accept clinical , endoscopic , anatomopathological and/or radiologic criterion . Presence complex perianal fistula 3 few fistulous tract assess MRI , Subjects persistent active complex perianal fistula non active luminal CD define CDAI ≤ 200 . Subjects either sex age 18 year . Good general state health accord finding clinical history physical examination . Presence severe proctitis ( prominent friability , spontaneous bleeding , multiple erosion , deep ulcer ) dominant active luminal disease require immediate therapy , assess rectosigmoidoscopy Subjects CDAI ≥ 221 . Subjects abscess ( unless complete toilet area drainage collection absence abscess collection confirm prior treatment start ) . The presence seton unless remove prior treatment start . Presence &gt; 3 fistulous tract and/or external opening . Subjects rectal and/or anal stenosis evaluate rectoscopy EUA . Subjects receive infliximab antiTNF agent 8 week cell treatment administration . Subjects receive tracrolimus ciclosporine 4 week cell treatment administration . Subjects rectovaginal fistula , anal fistula ( ) , and/or nonperianal enterocutaneous fistula . Subjects history abuse alcohol addictive substance 6 month prior inclusion . Subjects malignant tumor , except basal cell cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma , Subjects prior history malignant tumor , unless neoplastic disease remission previous 5 year . Subjects cardiopulmonary disease , opinion investigator , unstable sufficiently serious exclude patient study . Subjects type medical psychiatric disease , opinion investigator , could ground exclusion study . Subjects congenital acquire immunodeficiency . Subjects abnormal laboratory test finding contraindicate inclusion study . Subjects allergic anesthetic MRI contrast . MRI unfeasible , ( e.g . due presence pacemaker , hip replacement severe claustrophobia ) Subjects need surgery perianal region reason fistulas time inclusion study , need surgery foreseen region 26 week treatment administration . Subjects suffer major surgery severe trauma prior 6 month . Pregnant breastfeed woman . ( Both men woman use appropriate birth control method define investigator ) . Subjects currently receive , receive within 1 month prior enrolment clinical trial , investigational drug .</criteria>
