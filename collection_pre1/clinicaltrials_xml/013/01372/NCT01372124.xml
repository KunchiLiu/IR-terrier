	<brief_title>A Phase I Clinical Trial Evaluate Effect Renal Impairment Pharmacokinetics NOX-E36</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current diabetes therapy stop progression disease development diabetes mellitus ( DM ) -associated complication . A major concern DM-patients renal impairment due nephropathy lead reduced glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . It establish chronic ( sub ) clinical inflammation crucial onset progression DM . CCL2 , also know Monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 ( MCP 1 ) chemokine cysteine-cysteine family , secrete leukocyte tissue cell . CCL2 promote monocyte emigration bone marrow , activate monocyte macrophage directs migration sit inflammation . Recent animal study clinical trial indicate critical involvement CCL2 DM diabetic nephropathy , suggest CCL2 may potential target therapeutic intervention DM . Finally , protein overload oxidative challenge diseased kidney suggest stimulate CCL2 expression renal tubuli , thereby accelerate progression diabetic nephropathy . As NOX E36 design specifically target human MCP-1/CCL2 . This study perform evaluate role renal impairment adequate dose recommendation plan target population .</detailed_description>
