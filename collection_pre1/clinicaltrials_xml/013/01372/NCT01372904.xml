	<detailed_description>Prevention Cisplatin-Induced Hearing Loss Intratympanic Dexamethasone Treatment . Introduction : Cisplatin widely use chemotherapeutic agent treatment various malignant neoplasm , include testicular , ovarian , bladder , cervix uterus , head neck lung cancer 1-4 . Dose limit side effect Cisplatin include nephrotoxicity , neurotoxicity ototoxicity . While nephrotoxicity diminish control hydration therapy know cure preventive treatment available neurotoxicity ototoxicity 2,4 . Cisplatin-associated ototoxicity characterize bilateral , symmetric progressive usually irreversible sensorineural hearing loss . The hearing impairment dose relate , cumulative take place within hour day administration cisplatin 1-4 . The reported incidence cisplatin-induced hearing loss variable . Schweitzer calculate large number study average incidence 62 % range 11 97 % 5-6 . Damage cisplatin initially affect outermost row outer hair cell locate cochlear basal turn , cod hear high frequency range . Further insult affect remain row outer hair cell , inner hair cell , support cell . The pattern destruction proceeds basal turn towards apical region cochlea , increase impact hearing acuity low frequency 7 . Cisplatin induces cochlear toxicity production reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) one hand depletion antioxidant enzyme hand . This lead lipid , protein nucleic acid peroxidation destruction various cell organ apoptosis 4,7,8 . Various chemoprotectants suggest ameliorate cisplatin-induced ototoxcity . These include sodium thiosulfate , amifostine , diethyldithiocarbamate , 4-methylthiobenzoic acid , D- L-methionine , N-acetylcysteine , glutathione ester . The mechanisms action include direct antioxidant activity maintenance glutathione level 2,4 . Unfortunately , systemic delivery many agent find inhibit tumoricidal effect cisplatin and/or toxicity unknown effect humans 2,9 . Abundant corticosteroid receptor demonstrate within mouse critical inner ear structure suggest active role compound inner ear homeostasis 10 . Dexamethasone report up-regulate cochlear anti ROS enzymes activity various small mammal animal models2,3,11 . Dexamethasone treatment currently practice various pathology afflict inner ear ROS involve immediate delay ischemia-reperfusion mechanism injury . These include sudden sensorineural hearing loss , noise-induced hearing loss , salicylate aminoglycoside ototoxicity 2 . The discussion suggest rationale prevention cisplatin ototoxicity Dexamethasone . Intratympanic ( IT ) delivery drug contemporary method base diffusion active remedy across round window inner ear exerts therapeutic effect 12-14 . This method allow high inner ear concentration compare oral parenteral administration avoid undesirable systemic side-effects 12 . IT administration steroid vastly use last decade treatment sudden sensorineural hearing loss Meniere 's disease . 2,3,12 Currently employ technique IT drug delivery include trans-tympanic membrane injection middle ear cavity either directly tympanostomy ; place wick attach round window niche suggest facilitate good administration drug target organ ; implantation round window microcatheter connect micro-pump continuous drug delivery . Experimental IT strategies include application various hydrogel nanoparticles drug carrier , direct delivery medication inner ear via osmotic pump reciprocate perfusion system 12 . Our review literature yield three animal study examine protective effect IT dexamethasone prevention cisplatin-induced hearing loss . These study demonstrate promising result point potential IT dexamethasone prevention cisplatin ototoxicity human . Daldal et al carry control study guinea pig model . The study group treat IT dexamethasone either intra-peritoneal injection cisplatin , one control group cisplatin injection alone second control group give IT dexamethasone . IT dexamethasone cause cochlear damage evaluate distortion product otoacoustic emission ( DPOAEs ) . Cisplatin cause significant decrease DPOAEs amplitudes SNR value , IT dexamethasone treat group demonstrate significant protection cisplatin ototoxicity 11 . Hill et al evaluate ABR click tone burst evoke threshold mice receive intra-peritoneal cisplatin . In animal one ear treat IT dexamethasone second ear IT saline injection serve control . The result show significant protection click , 8 16 kHz threshold shift IT dexamethasone treat ear 3 . Paksoy et al employ similar ABR evaluation examine potential otoprotective effect IT dexamethasone cisplatin treat rat . While significant threshold elevation demonstrate cisplatin treated rat , IT dexamethasone preserve ABR responses 2 . We could find previously publish study examine role IT dexamethasone prevention cisplatin-induced ototoxicity human . The purpose study examine possible protective effect IT dexamethasone cisplatin-induced hearing loss , human . Our study hypothesis IT dexamethasone treatment would prevent cisplatin-induced hearing loss . Patients Methods : The study design prospective cohort control research . The participant would 30 consecutive patient suffer neoplastic disease treatment protocol include cisplatinum previously deliver . The cumulative cisplatin dose would least 300mg divided treatment session dosage dictate oncologist . After receive explanation study goal method , candidate participation study would sign informed consent . Baseline evaluation would include detailed history emphasis previous exist ear disease , microscopic otoscopy , pure tone , speech impedance audiometry , Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions ( DPOAEs ) test . This test specifically evaluate function cochlear outer hair cell primary target organ cisplatin ototoxicity . It previously show decreased signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) otoacoustic emission precedes appearance audiological pure tone threshold shift identify sub-clinical hearing loss.15 Exclusion criterion would include following : age &lt; 18 year ; exist previous pathology external middle ear avoid IT drug delivery performance DPOAEs testing ; retrocochlear hearing loss ; Meniere 's disease ; Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease ; fluctuate hearing loss ; history sudden sensory neural hearing loss ; previous radiation therapy head neck region ; baseline average pure tone audiometry thresholds 500-3000 Hz 4000-8000 Hz great 40 dB ; average SNR 6 dB DPOAEs f2 frequency 500-3000 Hz 4000-8000 Hz . Under topical anesthesia Emla cream ( mixture lidocaine 2.5 % prilocaine 2.5 % ) , 0.7ml Dexamethasone Phosphate 10mg/ml would inject unilaterally middle ear use 25 gauge spinal needle . The injected side would serve study ear contralateral side would control ear . The ear receiving treatment would randomly choose use computerized `` randomizer '' 16 . The trans-tympanic membrane injection would take place posterior inferior quadrant ear drum face round window niche . The patient would instruct lie 20 minute injection treat side avoid swallow cough . These measure take allow maximal contact Dexamethasone solution round window membrane minimize medication loss via Eustachian tube . Intratympanic Dexamethasone would deliver immediately prior cisplatin treatment maximal level medication scala tympani anticipate 1 hour post injection 10,17,18 maximal perilymph concentration cisplatinum intravenous injection guinea pig model reach 20 minutes19 . Pure tone , speech impedance audiometry DPOAEs would record prior first cisplatinum administration consecutive treatment . The final testing would take place 7 day last treatment session cumulative dose 300mg achieve . The following parameter would compare study control ear baseline consecutive examination : Pure tone average thresholds 500-3000 4000-8000 Hz ; DPOAEs SNR average 500-3000 4000-8000 f2 frequency . Normal distribution result would examine Shapiro-Wilk test . The comparison study control ear baseline consecutive evaluation would do use Student 's paired two-tailed t-test . Longitudinal change pure tone audiometry threshold DPOAEs SNR would evaluate repeated measure ANOVA . Sample size calculation base follow parameter : The event rate cisplatinum-induced sensorineural hearing loss 60 % 6 ; patient serf control one ear treat hear level compare untreated ear ; A successful treatment define prevent least third anticipated hearing loss study population ; desire statistical power 80 % p &lt; 0.05 . Taking parameter consideration calculate required sample size 30 patient .</detailed_description>
