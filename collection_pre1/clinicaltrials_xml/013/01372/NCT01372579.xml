	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give eribulin mesylate carboplatin together surgery work treat patient stage I-III triple-negative breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , eribulin mesylate carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) time definitive surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determination clinical response rate , measure clinical exam image study prior initiation therapy prior surgery . II . Measurement alpha B-crystalline tissue obtain initiation therapy time definitive surgery . III . Stem cell marker ( cluster differentiation [ CD ] 44+ , CD24- , CD133 , aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 [ ALDH1 ] evaluation NOTCH pathway ) tissue obtain initiation therapy time definitive surgery . IV . Measurement proliferation marker ( Ki67 ) treatment tissue obtain imitation therapy time definitive surgery . V. Measurement beta III tubulin tissue obtain initiation therapy time definitive surgery . VI . Measurement Tau tissue obtain initiation therapy time definitive surgery . VII . Safety evaluation , include follow patient alopecia neuropathy . VIII . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) stain treatment tissue obtain initiation therapy time definitive surgery . OUTLINE : Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously ( IV ) 2-5 minute carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
