	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Stereotactic radiosurgery may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Radiation therapy use high-energy x ray kill tumor cell . It yet know whether stereotactic radiosurgery effective whole-brain radiation therapy treat patient brain metastasis remove surgery . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well stereotactic radiosurgery work compare whole-brain radiation therapy treat patient brain metastasis remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiosurgery Whole-Brain Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Brain Metastases That Have Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Goals 1 . Overall Survival - To determine patient one four brain metastasis whether improved overall survival patient receive SRS surgical bed compare patient receive WBRT . 2 . Neurocognitive Progression - To determine patient one four brain metastasis whether less neurocognitive progression post-randomization patient receive SRS surgical bed compare patient receive WBRT . Secondary Goals 1 . Quality Life ( QOL ) - To determine patient resect brain metastasis whether improved QOL patient receive SRS surgical bed compare patient receive WBRT . 2 . Central Nervous System Failure - To determine patient one four brain metastasis whether equal long time central nervous system ( CNS ) failure ( brain ) patient receive SRS surgical bed compare patient receive WBRT . 3 . Functional Independence - To determine patient one four brain metastases whether long duration functional independence patient receive SRS surgical bed compare patient receive WBRT . 4 . Long-Term Neurocognitive Status - To determine patient one four brain metastasis whether good long-term neurocognitive status patient receive SRS surgical bed compare patient receive WBRT . 5 . Adverse Events - To tabulate descriptively compare post-treatment adverse event associate intervention . 6 . Local Tumor Bed Recurrence - To evaluate local tumor bed recurrence 6 month post-surgical SRS surgical bed comparison WBRT . 7 . Local Recurrence - To evaluate time local recurrence post-surgical SRS surgical bed comparison WBRT . 8 . CNS Failure Patterns - To evaluate difference CNS failure pattern ( local , distant , leptomeningeal ) patient receive SRS surgical bed compare patient receive WBRT . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord age year ( &lt; 60 v ≥ 60 ) , extracranial disease control ( ≤ 3 month vs &gt; 3 month ) , number pre-operative brain metastasis ( 1 vs 2-4 ) , histology ( lung v radioresistant [ brain metastasis sarcoma , melanoma , renal cell carcinoma histology ] v ) , resection cavity maximal diameter ( ≤ 3 cm v &gt; 3 cm ) . Patient must complete baseline QOL neurocognitive test prior registration/randomization . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo whole-brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) day , 5 day week , approximately 3 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) use gamma knife linear accelerator procedure . Event monitoring occur 5 year post registration/randomization .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Preregistration 1 . Number Brain Metastases Four few brain metastasis ( define preoperative MRI CT brain scan ) status post resection one lesion . 2 . NonCNS Primary Site Pathology resect brain metastasis must consistent noncentral nervous system primary site . Note : Patients without active disease outside nervous system eligible ( include patient unknown primary ) , long pathology brain consistent noncentral nervous system primary site . 3 . Size Metastases Any unresected lesion must measure &lt; 3.0 cm maximal extent contrast MRI CT brain scan obtain ≤ 35 day prior preregistration . The unresected lesion treat SRS outline treatment section protocol . Note : The metastasis size restriction apply resect brain metastasis ; resect brain metastasis surgical cavity size determines eligibility . 4 . Size Resection Cavity Resection cavity must measure &lt; 5.0 cm maximal extent postoperative MRI CT brain scan obtain ≤35 day prior preregistration . Note : It permissible resection dominant brain metastasis include small `` satellite '' metastasis long single resection cavity less maximum size requirement . 5 . Tumor Staging Procedures All standard tumorstaging procedure necessary define baseline extra cranial disease status complete ≤42 day prior preregistration . 6 . Treatment Gamma Knife Radiosurgery Able treat either gamma knife linear acceleratorbased radiosurgery system . 7 . Age ≥ 18 year 8 . Neurocognitive Testing Willing able complete neurocognitive test without assistance family companion . Note : Because neurocognitive test one primary goal study , patient must able utilize English language booklet ( and/or French booklet enrol Canada ) . 9 . Quality Life ( QOL ) Questionnaires Willing able complete QOL assistance 10 . ECOG Performance Status ECOG Performance Status ( PS ) 0 , 1 , 2 . 11 . SRS Credentialed IROC Houston Quality Assurance The site 's SRS facility IROC Houston Quality Assurance approve . 12 . Neurocognitive Testing Credentialing The site study team member perform neurocognitive testing patient must credentialing confirm completion neurocognitive test training protocol . 13 . Written Informed Consent Provide write informed consent 14 . Mandatory Samples Correlative Tests Willing provide mandatory blood urine sample correlative research purpose . Preregistration 1 . Pregnancy , Nursing Contraception pregnant woman , nurse woman men woman childbearing potential unwilling employ adequate contraception throughout study men 3 month complete treatment . 2 . Prior Cranial Radiation Therapy 3 . MRI CT Scans Inability complete MRI CT scan contrast head . 4 . Gadolinium Allergy Known allergy gadolinium . 5 . Cytotoxic Chemotherapy Planned cytotoxic chemotherapy SRS WBRT . 6 . Other Tumor Types Primary germ cell tumor , small cell carcinoma , lymphoma 7 . Leptomeningeal Metastasis Widespread definitive leptomeningeal metastasis 8 . Location Brain Metastasis A brain metastasis locate ≤ 5 mm optic chiasm within brainstem . Randomization 1 . Number Unresected Lesions Postoperative MRI CT scan confirm zero , one , two three unresected lesion . 1.1 Each unresected lesion must measure ≤ 3.0 cm maximal extent contrast postoperative MRI CT brain scan . 1.2 Note : The preregistration , postoperative , brain scan may use randomization scan obtain ≤ 28 day prior randomization . 1.3 Note : If unresected brain metastasis ( i.e. , brain metastasis resect ) , postoperative CT brain scan may use obtain ≤ 28 day prior randomization . 2 . Size Resection Cavity Postoperative MRI CT scan confirms resection cavity measure &lt; 5.0 cm maximal extent . 2.1 Note : The preregistration , postoperative brain scan may use randomization scan obtain ≤ 28 day prior randomization . 2.2 Note : If unresected brain metastasis ( i.e. , brain metastasis resect ) , postoperative CT brain scan may use obtain ≤28 day prior randomization . 3 . Urine Serum Pregnancy Test Negative urine serum pregnancy test do ≤ 7 day prior randomization , woman child bear potential . Randomization none</criteria>
