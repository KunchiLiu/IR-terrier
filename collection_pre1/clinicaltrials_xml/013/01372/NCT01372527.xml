	<brief_summary>Although considerable evidence current health IT improve certain element care , effective efficient implementation health IT system primary care population management currently know . Indeed , many system currently take `` case-management '' approach identify address clinical care issue high risk patient , system knowledge apply risk-based approach account adverse clinical outcome risk ( e.g . breast cancer woman indicate screen 4 year ) clinical process risk ( e.g . likelihood specific patient ignore reminder letter would therefore benefit direct phone person contact ) . The investigator propose directly test hypothesis implement health IT platform 1 ) provide novel risk-based decision support use data derive electronic health record ( EHR ) 2 ) leverage clinician 's unique knowledge patient panel result effective efficient population-based primary care . The investigator test hypothesis practice-randomized clinical trial preventive cancer screen within primary care Practice-Based Research Network ( PBRN ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Population-Based Patient-Centric Care : Comprehensive Preventive Cancer Screening Using Health IT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In prior NIH-funded research , investigator demonstrate efficacy IT-based population management system improve breast cancer screening ( NCI R21 CA121908 ) . The investigator expand current IT platform single function ( breast cancer screen ) package cancer prevention action ( breast , cervical , colorectal cancer screen ) examine added benefit population-level preventive cancer care direct specific clinician knowledge individual patient need . Moreover , rather compare system currently sub-optimal `` usual care '' practice , goal test whether impact intervention exceed current state-of-the-art IT-based population management . Therefore , control group practice receive augment standard care define population-level reminder system automate patient contact . In augmented standard care control practice , investigator implement system include : 1 ) population-based perspective identify eligible patient overdue screening , 2 ) automate , centralized process contact select patient letter , 3 ) result management system automatically track test schedule completion , 4 ) web-based , easily accessible tool allow practice personnel contact patient complete test , 5 ) use patient navigator high risk patient respond initial outreach . In control arm , process escalate reminder intervention letter , contact phone call , patient navigator , occur standard algorithmic fashion without provider input . While yet standard care nationwide , prior study prove efficacy approach . In intervention practice , investigator enhance augment standard care implement novel system enable physician clinical population manager individualize care patient panel use tool classify organize patient clinical attribute . The investigator hypothesize personalized identification patient clinical outcome clinical process risk status improve efficacy efficiency resource allocation decision . The key addition health IT system intervention practice : 1 ) clinical system IT platform organize present clinical data clinician 's patient panel , 2 ) accessible Web-based tool allow clinician ( physician clinical population manager ) view , organize , investigate patient panel , 3 ) simple process clinician make tailor screen decision designate method clinical intervention base upon patient 's risk profile .</detailed_description>
