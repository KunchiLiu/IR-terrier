	<brief_summary>The purpose investigate whether polyps look different colonoscopy , form via different mutation different risk turn cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Characteristics Colonic Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laterally spread tumour ( LSTs ) , polyps lateral extension along colon wall minimal vertical growth . It become evident last year rather single entity require accumulation mutation , colon cancer fact heterogenous disease form via multiple distinct genetic pathway . Additionally , improve endoscopic characterization , note experience Westmead hospital two macroscopically distinct type LSTs , `` granular '' `` non granular '' , different natural history risk invasive cancer . It therefore hypothesise different polyp type different genetic abnormality , potentially form via distinct genetic pathway , although theory widely examine . This knowledge would important further understanding development cancer . There accumulate evidence genetic abnormality may better predictor cancer behaviour histological grade . Additionally , guideline colonoscopy surveillance currently one size fit approach reflect genetic heterogeneity disease knowledge 5 % polyps progress cancer . Genetic study may assess future cancer risk person polyp remove plan surveillance colonoscopy frequency . This area interest currently due national bowel cancer screen programme , obvious cost implication decision maker .</detailed_description>
