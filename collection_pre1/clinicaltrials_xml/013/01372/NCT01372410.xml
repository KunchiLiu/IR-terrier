	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize dose response GSK573719 dose 15.6 microgram ( mcg ) 125 mcg daily patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Treatment dos GSK573719 dose twice daily also include evaluate dosing frequency . Treatment tiotropium ( 18 mcg ) daily via Handihaler include active control . A placebo treatment include order evaluate absolute treatment effect different dos GSK573719 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized , Double Blind , Placebo Controlled , Incomplete Block , Crossover , Dose Ranging Study Evaluate Dose Response GSK573719 Administered Once Twice Daily Over 7 Days Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhaled bronchodilator , beta 2 agonist anticholinergic , inhaled corticosteroid mainstay therapy patient diagnose COPD . Anticholinergic bronchodilator long act muscarinic receptor antagonist function block endogenous airway smooth muscle cholinergic tone . Treatment anticholinergic show significantly improve forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , rest dynamic lung hyperinflation , symptom , exercise capacity patient COPD . Currently tiotropium approve long act muscarinic antagonist available treatment COPD . This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo control , three way crossover , incomplete block study evaluate 4 dos GSK573719 inhale daily 2 dos GSK573719 inhale twice daily 7 day patient COPD . Tiotropium include open label active comparator . A placebo treatment include evaluate treatment effect GSK573719 dose . Pharmacokinetic profile GSK573719 also determine . Each eligible subject receive sequence 3 8 potential treatment total 3 treatment period per subject . There 7 clinic visit , three 24 hour serial spirometry perform . The total duration subject participation approximately 9 week .</detailed_description>
