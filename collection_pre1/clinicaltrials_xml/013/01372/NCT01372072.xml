	<brief_summary>Noninvasive ventilation ( NIV ) form ventilation deliver mask important mode treatment patient acute chronic respiratory ( breathe ) failure . Humidification widely accept essential part ventilation strategy patient receive invasive ventilation ( i.e . via tube insert mouth ) , role NIV use proven . Consequently , variation practice regard humidification NIV . Humidification important maintain upper low airway mucosal function patient require NIV often report symptom , throat dryness , due lack airway humidity . Success NIV acute set dependent many factor include , patient tolerance NIV acute phase . In patient chronic obstructive airway disease ( COPD ) , poor tolerance result NIV failure , necessitate endotracheal intubation treatment failure . Furthermore , invasive ventilation increase risk hospital acquire pneumonia , associate bad outcome . In long term set NIV use , patient frequently report symptom due dry airways adherence NIV highly variable . Adherence patient important improve quality length life . Humidification device may technically effective , clinician concern regard potential negative effect device . There requirement evaluate use humidification acute long term use NIV , particular , term patient ventilator interaction , impact comfort adherence NIV . This effect overall effectiveness ventilation . The investigator propose randomise controlled trial investigate effect humidification system noninvasive ventilation .</brief_summary>
