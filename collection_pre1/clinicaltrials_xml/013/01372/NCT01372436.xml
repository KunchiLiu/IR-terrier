	<detailed_description>Main goal : Reducing social inequality dental health Alpes-Maritimes identification high-risk subject order implement effective preventive action focus people likely benefit action . Carrying prospective representative cohort , school , period 4 year follow objective : - To study pattern risk factor tooth decay , define HAS , representative study sample , particularly assess part play zone schooling ( priority education area ( low socio-economic ) ( PEA ) ) . - To evaluate , representative French sample , relevance caries risk ( CR ) factor define HAS base analysis foreign literature . - To evaluate interest bacteriological test use technique real-time PCR ( Cario-analysis ® , Pierre Fabre Oral Care ) assessment CR , risk factor take account . - To study interest use laser fluorescence device ( Diagnodent ® Pen , Kavo ) compare clinical examination alone , detection caries difficult diagnose ( approximal caries small enamel lesion ) impact caries risk assessment . Study Type : prospective cohort study . Population study : This study conduct 360 primary school 89 high-schools Alpes Maritimes ( randomize study ) . They divide two stratum ( priority education area ) . Within stratum level education ( primary school high school ) , school choose random corresponding list number child need 1rst grade 5th grade reach . Pupils follow investigator . Subjects Number : 678 ( 339 1rst grade 339 5th grade proportionally divide non-PEA PEA ) . Duration follow-up : 4 year Frequency visit : annual visit Oral health screen - clinical examination ( probe mirror ) new laser fluorescence device ( DIAGNOdent ® pen , Kavo ) . Salivary Tests : bacteriological real-time PCR ( Cario-analysis ® Oral Care Pierre Fabre ) CRT Buffer ® Ivoclar Vivadent ) Statistical analyse - Descriptive analysis logistic regression model ( dependent variable high caries risk ( CAODM36-CAODJ0 &gt; = 4 )</detailed_description>
