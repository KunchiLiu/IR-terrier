	<brief_summary>This study divide study group , describe . The goal Groups 1A 2A clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination ARRY-520 carfilzomib give patient multiple myeloma plasma cell leukemia . The goal Groups 1B 2B study learn combination carfilzomib ARRY-520 help control multiple myeloma plasma cell leukemia . Researchers would also like learn ARRY-520 help carfilzomib work patient build resistance carfilzomib carfilzomib alone help control disease . The safety study drug study group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Arry-520 Carfilzomib Patients With Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drugs : Carfilzomib , investigational drug , design keep cancer cell repair . If cancer cell repair , may cause die . ARRY-520 , investigational drug , design prevent cancer cell reproduce . By prevent tumor cell reproduce , ARRY-520 may slow spread cancer cell may cause die . Dexamethasone steroid cause myeloma cancer cell die . Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 3-6 participant enrol Group 1A , 28 total participant enrol Group 1B . There 1 5 group 3-6 participant Group 2A 28 participant Group 2B . Group 1A : If enrol Group 1A , dose ARRY-520 receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level ARRY-520 . Each new group receive high dose ARRY-520 group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose ARRY-520 found . Group 1B Expansion : If enrol Group 1B , receive ARRY-520 high dose tolerate Group 1A . Everyone Group 1A B receive dose carfilzomib . Group 2A : If enrol Group 2A , dose carfilzomib receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level carfilzomib . Each new group receive high dose carfilzomib group , intolerable side effect see . Sometimes , new dose level one drug raise , dose level drug dose give early group . This continue high tolerable dose carfilzomib find . Group 2B Expansion : If enrol Group 2B , receive carfilzomib high tolerate dose tolerate Group 2A . You also receive dexamethasone . Everyone Group 2A B receive high tolerate dose ARRY-520 find Group 1 . Group 2B patient may receive ARRY-520 either high tolerate dose Group 1 one dose level lower . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . On Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 Cycles 1-8 , receive carfilzomib vein 10-30 minute . On Days 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 Cycles 1-8 , receive ARRY-520 vein 1 hour . After 8 cycle , may continue receive carfilzomib Days 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 . If doctor think best interest , may also receive ARRY-520 Days 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 may continue carfilzomib Days 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 ARRY-520 . On Day 1 , 8 , 15 cycle , give dexamethasone mouth vein help prevent side effect . If vein 10 minute . You may also receive dexamethasone develop chill , rigor , fever , shortness breath carfilzomib give . You may also receive filgrastim skin . This begin Day 3 4 Day 17 18 every cycle , continue 1 time day 5-7 day . You take anti-viral drug ( acyclovir , famciclovir , valacyclovir ) study help prevent side effect . Your doctor explain often need take anti-viral drug . You must well hydrate take carfilzomib : - Starting 2 day first dose carfilzomib , must drink 6-8 cup ( 8 ounce ) water day . - If doctor think need , may need keep drink 6-8 cup water day Cycle 2 beyond . - During every Cycle 1 dose , also give fluid vein hour receive drug . Study Visits : At every study visit , ask side effect may ( numbness and/or tingle ) . On Day 1 every cycle : - You complete physical exam , include measurement vital sign , height , weight . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test check status disease . The routine blood draw also include pregnancy test able become pregnant . A urine test may also use rather blood test check pregnancy . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine collect check status disease . This urine collect 24-hour period . You give container urine collection . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 8 15 Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-dosing visit . Leftover blood tissue store research tissue bank MD Anderson use future research related cancer . Before sample use research , researcher must get approval Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) MD Anderson . The IRB committee doctor , researcher , community member . The IRB responsible protect study participant make sure research safe ethical . Your sample give code number . No identify information directly link sample . Only researcher charge bank access code number able link sample . This allow medical data relate sample update need . End-of-Dosing Visit : Within 30 day stop take study drug , end-of-dosing visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . - You ask drug may take side effect symptom ( numbness and/or tingle ) may . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) urine collect check status disease . This urine collect 24-hour period . You give container urine collection . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw genetic biomarker test . This investigational study . ARRY-520 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Carfilzomib FDA approve commercially available treatment certain type multiple myeloma . Its use study investigational . Up 76 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Confirmed relapsed refractory MM PCL . Patients receive least 1 prior treatment regimen . Prior treatment must include least one full cycle proteasome inhibitor ( e.g. , bortezomib ) least one full cycle IMiD ( e.g. , thalidomide , lenalidomide pomalidomide ) . Patients prior ARRY520 carfilzomib allow dose escalation phase , however prior ARRY520 carfilzomib exclude dose expansion cohort 1 Part A . There 2 cohort dose expansion part A : Cohort 1 patient carfilzomib sensitive ; Cohort 2 patient carfilzomib refractory . 2 . Continuation Inclusion Criteria # 1 : Part B : For Part B dose expansion : Once MTD establish Part A , additional dose escalation occur subsequent dose escalation Carfilzomib . During dose escalation Part B , pt must least 1 line prior therapy limitation prior therapy . Patients prior clinical benefit/response ARRY520 Carfilzomib SD better may eligible dose expansion Part B . Dose expansion part B patient carfilzomib sensitive . 3 .
