	<brief_summary>Background : - One way tumor able grow form new blood vessel supply nutrient oxygen . - Vandetanib ( ZD6474 ) experimental drug block certain protein surface tumor blood vessel cell involve formation new blood vessel . - Blocking protein may prevent tumor cell blood vessel continue grow . Objectives : - To determine whether vandetanib cause tumor shrink stabilize patient advanced kidney cancer . - To determine vandetanib may work people kidney cancer develop test may helpful study kidney cancer . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age old advance clear cell kidney cancer whose disease worsen treatment one follow drug : sunitinib , sorafenib , interleukin-2 temsirolimus ; patient stop treatment drug due unacceptable side effect ; patient unable receive standard treatment . Design : - Patients take vandetanib pill day 28-day cycle . - Patients follow clinic every 2 week first month treatment every 4 week physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram review drug side effect . - Patients image scan ( compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ) every 8 week monitor tumor growth . MRI scan also do look tumor blood flow treatment begin , 24 hour first dose treatment , 4 8 week start treatment - Optional tumor biopsy ( surgical removal sample tumor tissue ) may do start vandetanib treatment 4 week treatment look drug effect tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - von Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) inactivation mutation promoter hypermethylation see high proportion sporadic clear cell renal cancer . - Inactivation VHL lead accumulation protein target degradation ubiquitin pathway , include group transcriptionally active protein call hypoxia inducible factor ( HIF ) , whose alpha subunit undergo degradation VHL-dependent fashion . - Accumulation HIFs result overexpression several gene include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , glucose transporter 1 ( GLUT-1 ) , transform growth factor ( TGF-a ) , platelet derive growth factor ( PDGF ) , erythropoietin , believe play role tumorigenesis , tumor progression metastasis . - Kinase insert domain-containing receptor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( kinase insert domain receptor ( KDR ) /vascular endothelial growth factor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) ) endothelial cell receptor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) play crucial role mediate tumor angiogenesis , EGFR ( receptor TGF-a epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) believe mediate tumor growth proliferation . - ZD6474 orally administer receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor activity KDR/VEGFR2 epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . Objective : Primary Objective -To evaluate efficacy ( overall response rate ) single agent ZD6474 advance clear cell renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Secondary Objectives - To evaluate progression free survival patient treat ZD6474 . - To study safety tolerability ZD6474 . - To evaluate correlation VHL mutational status response ZD6474 . - To investigate effect ZD6474 circulate endothelial cell endothelial progenitor cell explore utility marker surrogates angiogenesis inhibition . - To investigate effect ZD6474 potential biomarkers angiogenesis plasma VEGF soluble VEGFR2 . - To study effect ZD6474 treatment tumor vascular flow permeability use dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging . - To investigate effect ZD6474 EGFR VEGFR mediate signal use tumor biopsy tissue ( available ) . Eligibility : - Adults measurable advance clear cell renal carcinoma - Patients must receive three prior systemic therapy ( two agent know inhibit VEGF VEGFR ) must either progress unable receive 1 ) Sunitinib sorafenib , 2 ) High dose interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . Design : - Single agent ZD6474 administer daily dose 300mg/day . - Patients evaluate response every 8 week use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . - The study base open label Simon two-stage optimal phase II design accrue maximum 37 patient .</detailed_description>
