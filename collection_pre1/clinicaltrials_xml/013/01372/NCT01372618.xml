	<brief_summary>This proof principle clinical trial evaluate use pasireotide ( SOM230 ) woman ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) breast . Surgery radiotherapy use treatment DCIS subsequent treatment antiestrogens effective reduce occurrence invasive breast cancer . Unfortunately , treatment antiestrogens carry potential serious side effect toxicity intolerable patient . Preliminary data suggest inhibition IGF-1 action breast least effective tamoxifen . Pasireotide somatostatin analog prevents mammary development inhibit IGF-1 action directly mammary gland also indirectly without cause menopausal symptom . This study expansion work previously do woman atypical hyperplasia breast , show treatment pasireotide 10 day cause reduction cellularity precancerous lesion . In present study , woman DCIS treat pasireotide 20 day prior surgical excision . Endpoints follow : 1 . To determine whether pasireotide inhibit cell proliferation angiogenesis ( sign tumor growth ) , stimulate apoptosis ( cell death ) surgically excise tissue comparison core biopsy woman estrogen receptor ( ER ) positive DCIS . Both core biopsy surgical excision standard care procedure woman DCIS regardless participation trial . 2 . To use dynamic contrast enhance MRI ass patient treatment pasireotide evaluate change tumor volume tumor relate feature 3 . In previous study find many woman experience slight elevation blood sugar 10 day treatment pasireotide . Other work show effect often resolve great duration treatment . We therefore expand duration treatment study 20 day assess initial hyperglycemia see pasireotide improves treatment duration progress .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) direct precursor invasive breast cancer also marker increase chance develop invasive cancer ipsilateral contralateral breast . Surgery radiotherapy use treatment DCIS subsequent treatment antiestrogens effective reduce occurrence invasive breast cancer DCIS patient . Unfortunately , treatment antiestrogens carry potential side effect toxicity . The investigator data suggest inhibition IGF-I action breast effective antiestrogens , raise hope might effective enough stand alone treatment . Pasireotide somatostatin analog prevents mammary development inhibit IGF-I action directly mammary gland also indirectly , without cause menopausal symptom sign . As estrogen ( E2 ) progesterone ( P ) require IGF-I order act , part inhibitory effect pasireotide prevention estrogen action . The investigator data indicate IGF-I also direct action breast independent steroid hormone . One example IGF-I direct stimulatory effect mammary development absence E2 . Additionally , IGF-I effect ER-negative tumor cell line reverse IGF-I inhibition . If pasireotide inhibit E2 related E2 unrelated effect IGF-I would likely effective antiestrogens . Preliminary data rat show pasireotide , minimum , entirely substitute tamoxifen . To determine whether pasireotide activity woman high risk breast cancer , similar observe rat , investigator award DOD Synergistic Idea grant . Those data expect reported soon . The investigator plan expand work determine principle whether pasireotide potential treat DCIS . The investigator plan treat 24 woman , low grade ( 8 ) , intermediate grade ( 8 ) high grade ( 8 ) ER-positive DCIS tumor . The investigator assess effect apoptosis , cell proliferation , angiogenesis , ER PR phosphorylation IGF-IR IRS-1 20 day treatment pasireotide core biopsy vs. surgical excision specimen . These endpoint measure specific immunohistochemistry . Simultaneously , investigator determine whether IGF-I inhibition reduce angiogenesis DCIS use dynamic contrast enhance MRI ( DCE-MRI ) 3.0 Tesla , addition mammography . This MRI technique able detect early change neo-angiogenesis associate invasive breast cancer DCIS . Pasireotide theoretically inhibit angiogenesis woman , mouse . The DCE-MRI may also show change tumor volume , morphologic kinetic feature . Imaging serve additional measure monitor response treatment . Results correlate pathology immunohistochemical endpoint . In previous work investigator note increase blood glucose early starting pasireotide , work others indicate side effect last several week . The investigator find suppressed level insulin ( due pasireotide effect Î² cell ) begin rise day 10 treatment . Therefore , extend treatment period 10 20 day daily monitor patient enable u make certain early elevate glucose associate pasireotide temporary . Another side effect reduction circulating level IGF-I . Theoretically , could lead body change associate growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) . Although , tamoxifen raloxifene also low serum IGF-I , woman take usually complain symptom GHD , issue must investigate . However , pasireotide find effective treatment DCIS , benefit would likely outweigh risk .</detailed_description>
