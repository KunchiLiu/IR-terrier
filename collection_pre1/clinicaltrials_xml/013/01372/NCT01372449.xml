	<brief_title>A Multi-site Double-blind Placebo-controlled Trial Memantine Versus Placebo Children With Autism ( MEM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Abnormalities modulation glutamate system report multiple investigator study animal model , post-mortem brain , single gene disorder overlap phenotype autism . Abnormalities glutamatergic function report disorder affect variety behavioral neurological domain , mood stability , cognitive flexibility , memory , motor function . Numerous study report variety memory motor deficit child autism . Whereas neurobiology deficit area active research , paucity intervention research deficits autism . This study attempt study effect N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor ( NMDA ) inhibitor , memantine , memory , motor praxis/expressive language skill child autism . Methods : Children age 6-12 year verbal meet criterion Autism Spectrum Disorder recruit across 2 site . After consent , child assess memory function , expressive language output motor skills/praxis . They randomize 1:1 memantine versus placebo 6 month . The effect medication mention symptom domain well safety population study 6 month period .</detailed_description>
