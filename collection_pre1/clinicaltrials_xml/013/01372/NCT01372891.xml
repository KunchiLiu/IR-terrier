	<brief_title>Urine Adiponectin Concentration Prediction Contrast Induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Contrast induce nephropathy ( CIN ) severe complication percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . CIN responsible approximately genic renal insufficiency third cause hospital-acquired renal failure injury endothelial renal tubule responsible CIN . However marker reliably identify CIN patient undergo PCI rare . Adiponectin 30-kDa adipocyte-derived vasoactive peptide closely link component metabolic syndrome . Recent study demonstrate quantification urinary adiponectin excretion appear independent indicator vascular damage potentially identify increase risk vascular event . Therefore , investigator presume adiponectin excretion may predict incidence CIN . The present study determine ability urinary total adiponectin isoforms excretion prediction CIN patient undergo PCI .</detailed_description>
