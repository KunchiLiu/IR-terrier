	<brief_summary>The primary aim trial compare survival hospital discharge continuous chest compression ( CCC ) versus standard American Heart Association ( AHA ) recommend cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) interrupt chest compression ( ICC ) patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OOHCA ) . The primary null hypothesis rate survival hospital discharge affect use continuous compression passive positive pressure ventilation ( intervention group ) versus CPR compression interrupt ventilation ratio 30:2 ( control group ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim trial compare survival hospital discharge continuous chest compression ( CCC ) versus standard American Heart Association ( AHA ) recommend cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) interrupt chest compression ( ICC ) patient out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OOHCA ) . For study , CCC consist series three cycle continuous chest compression without pause ventilation follow rhythm analysis restoration spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) , whichever occur first . ICC consist series three cycle standard CPR cycle comprise chest compression interpose ventilation compression : ventilation ratio 30:2 ( per AHA guideline ) follow rhythm analysis ROSC , whichever occur first . In either patient group , duration manual CPR first rhythm analysis 30 second 120 second . This treatment period follow two cycle compression rhythm analysis ( i.e . approximately 2 minute duration ) either group . Other aims trial compare survival discharge among patient group first-recorded rhythm priori subgroup , well compare neurological status discharge , mechanistic outcome adverse event control intervention group .</detailed_description>
