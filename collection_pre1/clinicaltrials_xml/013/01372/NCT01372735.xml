	<brief_summary>The current standard treatment patient primarily resectable pancreatic tumor consist surgery follow adjuvant chemotherapy . But even prognostic favourable group , long term survival disappointing high local distant failure rate . Postoperative chemoradiation show improved local control overall survival compare surgery alone value additional radiation question case adjuvant chemotherapy . However , remain strong rationale addition radiation therapy consider high rate microscopically incomplete resection surgery . As postoperative administration radiation therapy general disadvantage , neoadjuvant intraoperative approach theoretically offer benefit term dose escalation , reduction toxicity patient comfort especially hypofractionated regimen highly conformal technique like intensity-modulated radiation therapy consider . Therefore NEOPANC trial design prospective , one arm single center study investigate combination neoadjuvant short course intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( 5x5 Gy ) combination surgery intraoperative radiation therapy ( 15 Gy ) follow adjuvant chemotherapy accord german treatment guideline patient primarily resectable pancreatic cancer . The primary objective NEOPANC trial evaluate general feasibility approach local recurrence rate one year . Secondary endpoint progression-free survival , overall survival , acute late toxicity , postoperative morbidity mortality quality life .</brief_summary>
