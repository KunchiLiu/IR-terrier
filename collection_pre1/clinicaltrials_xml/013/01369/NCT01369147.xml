	<brief_summary>Protein and/or energy deficit associate increased rate hospital infection , skeletal muscle weakness , impair wound healing , prolong convalescence ICU patient . To prevent treat malnutrition , enteral nutrition ( EN ) and/or parenteral nutrition ( PN ) routinely give worldwide significant proportion ICU patient . Optimal caloric requirement critically ill patient unknown due lack rigorous randomize clinical trial . The comparative efficacy energy dos critically ill patient unknown clinical recommendation conflict controversial ; issue focus study . The investigator design pilot , single-center Randomized Clinical Trial ( RCT ) prospectively compare , first time , clinical efficacy different energy dos ICU patient require PN due intestinal failure/dysfunction . A total 60 patient study ( 20 per energy dose group ) generate critical preliminary data need inform subsequent appropriately power Phase III multicenter trial . The primary aim study perform control , double-blind , prospective , randomize , intent-to-treat Phase II clinical trial test efficacy three specific energy dos [ 0.6 , 1.0 1.3 x measure REE ( rest energy expenditure ) , respectively ] , give 28 consecutive day ICU post-ICU course , 28-day total hospital-acquired infection ( primary endpoint ) , Blood Stream Infections ( BSI ) , important clinical outcome medical/surgical ICU patient require specialized parenteral ± enteral feeding . The investigator would also determine , subject A ) impact cumulative mean daily 28-day energy deficit [ energy intake-measured REE ] clinical outcome endpoint ; B ) practical utility estimate REE determine Harris-Benedict equation versus measure REE across different energy dos . The investigator would also like determine impact administer energy dose energy deficit global metabolomic pattern time association key clinical outcome . This study allow u generate need data effect energy dose energy deficit global metabolomic pattern time may associate key clinical outcome ICU patient . This exploratory research also need develop new method evaluate metabolic response nutrition support potential relationship clinical outcome .</brief_summary>
