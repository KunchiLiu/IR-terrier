	<brief_summary>Background : - Stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) use treat kind cancer , blood cell disorder , immune disorder . Stem cell donor blood use replace recipient stem cell bone marrow . The recipient bone marrow produce new blood cell . Some new cell involve immune system like donor cell . Sometimes immune cell SCT attack recipient normal tissue , include eye . This type immune attack call graft-versus-host disease , GVHD . - The symptom ocular GVHD include eye pain , irritation , dryness , inflammation . When severe respond well treatment , ocular GVHD may also cause vision loss . Objective : - To learn graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) eye people stem cell transplantation . Eligibility : - Participants must least 18 year age . - They must take part study National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) National Heart , Lung Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) . - They must SCT schedule within next 30 day . Design : - The study last 1 year include six visit National Eye Institute . ( There optional visit 1 month SCT . ) When possible , visit study schedule do day visit NCI NHLBI protocol take part . - At visit , participant medical exam eye history take . They eye exam test measure ability make tear . Those study also tear fluid collect analysis lab . Tear fluid collection painless process . Blood drawn certain visit already collect transplant team .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The study objective study development ocular graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) participant treated stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) NIH , include exam finding prior SCT , change ocular sign symptom follow SCT response standard therapy participant identify dry eye ocular GVHD ; develop clinical outcome measure early onset advanced ocular GVHD provide estimate progression rate outcomes ; analyze tear fluid , impression cytology ( IC ) serum sample participant undergo SCT , identify biomarkers finding may predict onset ocular GVHD correlate disease progression response therapy establish cohort participant ocular GVHD anticipation future clinical trial . STUDY POPULATION : Up 50 adult participant undergo SCT NIH , 50 healthy adult participant enrol . DESIGN : This prospective , natural history study follow participant 12 month post-SC , option extend follow-up five year . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary objective outcome variable ocular surface stain use fluorescein lissamine green dye , measure Oxford criterion , scale range 0 15 eye . The primary subjective outcome measure Ocular Surface Disease Index ( OSDI ) , range 0 100 . Secondary outcome variable include best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) , tear film osmolarity , Schirmer tear test anesthesia , meibomian gland function tear break-up time . In addition , tear fluid biomarkers and/or IC study secondary outcome variable determine whether change biomarker level ( tear fluid ) cell density morphology ( IC ) correlate development progression ocular GVHD .</detailed_description>
