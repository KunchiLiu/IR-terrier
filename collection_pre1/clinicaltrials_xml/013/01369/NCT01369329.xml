	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Ustekinumab Patients With Moderately Severely Active Crohn 's Disease Who Have Failed Are Intolerant Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) Antagonist Therapy ( UNITI-1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study ( CNTO1275CRD3001 `` UNITI-1 '' ) examine ustekinumab ( antibody medication inhibits inflammatory protein IL-12 IL-23 ) versus placebo ( otherwise identical except without ustekinumab antibody ) give intravenously ( IV ) adult moderately severely active Crohn 's disease previously respond , lose response , could tolerate TNF-antagonist medication ( specifically , infliximab , adalimumab certolizumab pegol ) . Ustekinumab ( also know Stelara ) approve treatment skin condition moderate severe plaque-type psoriasis , study examine ustekinumab provide benefit Crohn 's disease also assess risk side effect . Both positive negative outcome IV placebo versus two different dos IV ustekinumab track compare eight week , approximately 703 patient . Patients enrol study assign one 3 treatment group chance ( randomly , like roll dice ) , receive single IV administration study agent first study visit ( screening period ) , ask return 3 additional visit Week 8 . Patients complete study Week 8 visit remain eligible enter maintenance study ( CNTO1275CRD3003 `` IM-UNITI '' [ NCT01369355 ] ) , receive additional study agent , include administration ustekinumab patient receive placebo study improvement Crohn 's disease . Patients enter CNTO1275CRD3003 study final safety follow-up visit approximately 20 week receive study agent enter study Week 0 visit . .All patient receive single intravenous ( IV ) administration study drug ( either placebo ustekinumab ) first ( week 0 ) visit enter study.There 3 treatment group : Group 1 : Placebo ; Group 2 : ustekinumab 130 mg , Group 3 : weight-range base ustekinumab dos approximate ustekinumab 6 mg/kg : 260 mg ( weight &lt; = 55 kg ) , 390 mg ( weight &gt; 55 kg &lt; = 85 kg ) , 520 mg ( weight &gt; 85 kg ) .</detailed_description>
