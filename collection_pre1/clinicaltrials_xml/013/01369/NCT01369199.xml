	<brief_summary>The investigator propose evaluate safety efficacy short lead-in course ( 8 week ) entecavir follow combination entecavir plus peginterferon alfa-2a 40 week . The investigator hypothesize use potent nucleos ( ) ide analogue provide high rate loss HBeAg loss suppression HBV DNA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Entecavir Peginterferon Therapy HBeAg-Positive Immune-Tolerant Adults With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine efficacy treatment 8 week entecavir follow 40 week entecavir peginterferon treatment chronic hepatitis B hepatitis B `` e '' antigen ( HBeAg ) positive adult immune tolerant phase . To evaluate `` treatment '' safety sustain response treatment entecavir peginterferon alfa-2a treatment chronic hepatitis B HBeAg positive adult immune tolerant phase . A single arm treatment study 8 week entecavir follow 40 week entecavir peginterferon alfa-2a adult HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B normal near normal ALT level high serum level HBV DNA ( `` immune tolerant '' HBeAg-positive chronic hepatitis B ) . All participant follow week 96 ( 48 week discontinuation therapy treatment group ) time primary outcome measure .</detailed_description>
