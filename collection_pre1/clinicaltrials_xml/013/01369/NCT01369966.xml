	<brief_summary>Background : - Smoking associate serious health risk . People mental illness likely smoke . Researchers study brain circuit link smoke nicotine craving . This study look whether specific brain circuit explain high rate smoking people schizophrenia . Objectives : - To study brain activity smoker nonsmoker without schizophrenia , well family member . Eligibility : - Current smoker ( least 100 cigarette past year ) nonsmokers 18 62 year age one follow group : - Have diagnose schizophrenia . - Family member schizophrenia . - Healthy adult history severe mental illness brain trauma . - Family member healthy adult . Design : - People study screened physical exam , medical history , questionnaire , blood test . - They three visit : screen visit two study visit ( give 1 year apart ) . - At first study visit , take part train test magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Then MRI scan . - After first study visit , current smoker receive phone call study researcher every month 1 year . They ask smoke habit . - At second study visit , current smoker nonsmoker another MRI scan test . - Current smoker receive final phone call 1 year second study visit . They ask give information smoking habit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The health risk associate tobacco use high , even high people severe mental illness . The underlie brain circuitry smoking-mental illness comorbidity unknown . Identifying brain comorbidity circuitry important new therapeutic development . This study examine whether specific brain circuitry explain high rate smoking patient schizophrenia . Identifying key brain circuit associate smoking , especially smoke high risk population , provide concrete biomarkers new therapeutic development , ultimately reduce smoke related health burden . Study Population Schizophrenic patient family member , non-schizophrenia control family member , include smoker nonsmoker four group include study . Design 1 . A cross-sectional study subject baseline . They receive clinical diagnostic interview , functional , symptom , cognitive testing , MRI . They also blood drawn , identify brain circuit covariates associate severe smoking problem schizophrenia . 2 . A prospective longitudinal study design smoker encourage quit smoking smoke cessation support provide need , follow retesting image clinical assessment , identify brain circuit associate smoke cessation difficulty quit schizophrenia non-schizophrenia smoker . Outcome Measures Combining event-related rest fMRI technique , propose test hypothesis abnormal dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) ventral striatum ( VS ) circuit underlies high prevalence comorbid smoke schizophrenia . We also propose test specific clinical implication circuit include within-subject event-related fMRI study test mechanistic implication rsFC signal , prospective follow-up test circuit predictive validity smoking behavior change , genetic study describe path gene brain circuit smoke behavior .</detailed_description>
