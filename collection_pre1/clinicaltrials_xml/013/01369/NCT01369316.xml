	<brief_title>Circumferential Submucosal Incision Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Versus Conventional Endoscopic Mucosal Resection Colonic Polyps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator recently develop new , investigator believe safer effective technique endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) . Utilising new method investigator make small cut around polyp isolate . Subsequently Gelofusine solution inject beneath polyp provide great elevation . This allow u improve chance removal entire polyp one attempt one piece . It preferable remove polyp one piece minimise chance leave residual polyp tissue behind . Our team recently complete animal study compare newly develop technique conventional EMR . The investigator find significant improvement ability completely remove polyp one attempt . There also recent study overseas show new technique quite effective .</detailed_description>
