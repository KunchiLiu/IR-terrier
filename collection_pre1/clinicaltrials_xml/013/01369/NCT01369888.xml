	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers develop experimental cancer treatment call cell therapy . White blood cell call lymphocyte take tumor , grown large number lab , give back patient . Interleukin-15 , give patient cell ( call Young tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes Young TIL cell ) replace , help cell grow boost immune system . This process change normal cell cell able recognize tumor study lab . These cell destroy tumor cell test tube , scientist want see work inside body . Objectives : -To test effectiveness lymphocytes draw tumor cell combine interleukin-15 treat metastatic melanoma . Eligibility : - Patients must 18 - 66 year age diagnosis metastatic melanoma . - They heart lung function test , lab test , image procedure . - Patients may condition active systemic infection , blood clotting disorder , active major medical illness . - Patients may pregnant nursing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use IL-15 After Chemotherapy Lymphocyte Transfer Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes ( TIL ) mediate regression bulky metastatic melanoma administer autologous patient along high-dose aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting chemotherapy preparative regimen . - In analysis factor relate ability treatment mediate objective response , find highly significant inverse correlation reconstitution cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) + forkhead box P3 ( Foxp3 ) + T regulatory cell likelihood achieve objective response . - Interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) administration show increase number T regulatory cell trial find direct relationship number IL-2 dose reconstitution patient one week CD4+ Foxp3 + T regulatory cell . - Interleukin 15 ( IL-15 ) strong T cell growth factor , unlike IL-2 , IL-15 involve generation maintenance CD4+ Foxp3 + T regulatory cell inhibit immune reaction . - In pre-clinical adoptive cell transfer study utilize murine melanoma model , administration IL-15 follow adoptive cell transfer improve anti-tumor effect . Objectives : - The primary objective trial determine safety , toxicity , maximum tolerate dose intravenous recombinant IL-15 administer daily intravenous bolus 10 consecutive day patient metastatic melanoma receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy regimen adoptive transfer tumor infiltrate lymphocyte . - An additional primary objective determine whether combination able produce modest number clinical response . - The secondary objective involves determination level reconstitution T regulatory cell patient receive cell transfer follow IL-15 determine pharmacokinetics IL-15 level serum follow intravenous administration . Eligibility : - Patients great equal 18 year old pathologically confirm diagnosis metastatic melanoma . - Patients measurable disease , absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm^3 platelet count great 100,000/mm^3 . - No serious comorbid condition active systemic infection , coagulation disorder , active major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system . Design : - Patients metastatic melanoma undergo resection obtain tumor generation autologous TIL culture . - Patients receive non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow administration autologous Young TIL . In phase 1 portion study , patient receive recombinant human IL-15 dose 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 2 microgram per kilogram give intravenously daily 10 day start day cell transfer . One patient treat first dose level , patient experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) , additional patient treat dose confirm great 1/6 patient DLT prior proceed next high level . If 2 DLTs encounter cohort , study terminate . In cohort , group three six patient receive recombinant human IL-15 . Should single patient experience dose limit toxicity due cell transfer particular dose level , additional patient treat dose confirm great 1/6 patient DLT prior proceed next high level . If level 2 DLTs 3-6 patient identify , three additional patient accrue next-lowest dose , total 6 , order characterize safety maximum tolerate dose prior start phase 2 portion . In phase 2 portion study , patient receive non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow administration autologous Young TIL IL-15 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) establish phase 1 portion . - Studies perform determine reconstitution patient T regulatory cell determine pharmacokinetics IL-15 concentration serum .</detailed_description>

Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . 11 . More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , patient ' toxicity must recover grade 1 less ( except toxicity alopecia vitiligo ) . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion . 12 .
