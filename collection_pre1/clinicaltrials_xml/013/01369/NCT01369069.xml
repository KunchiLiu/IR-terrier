	<brief_summary>The Stroke Hyperglycemia Insulin Network Effort ( SHINE ) Trial multicenter , randomize , control clinical trial 1400 patient include approximately 60 enrol site . The study hypotheses treatment hyperglycemic acute ischemic stroke patient target glucose concentration ( 80mg/dL - 130 mg/dL ) safe result improve 3 month outcome stroke . Eligible subject must within 12 hour stroke symptom onset diabetes glucose concentration 110 mg/dL initial evaluation . The enrol site include Neurological Emergencies Treatment Trials ( NETT ) sit well non NETT site United States . The study evaluate safety efficacy target glucose control ( treatment group - IV insulin target 80-130 mg/dl ) verse control therapy sub q insulin plus basal insulin target glucose less 180 mg/ dL . The primary outcome functional outcome 3 month measure modified Rankin Scale ( mRS ) Score . The primary safety outcome severe hypoglycemia define &lt; 40 mg/dL . Enrollment occur 3.5 - 4 year .</brief_summary>
