	<brief_summary>Current method choose treatment major depressive disorder ( MDD ) inefficient . The Strategic Treatment Achieve Remission Depression ( STAR*D ) Trial reveal 1/3 patient treat antidepressant drug go remission first medication chosen . We hypothesize pattern recognition software use Machine Learning method accurately predict response variety antidepressant medication ( ADM ) cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) train use pre-treatment demographic , clinical , laboratory electroencephalographic ( EEG ) data . These algorithms might assist clinician chose , give patient , antidepressant treatment option great probability favourable response achievable use current best practise method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective study : To improve antidepressant treatment efficacy determine , advance , give subject 's probability response range antidepressant treatment . The study intend train test , large sample depressed subject , digital system show accurate predictor antidepressant response pilot study . The accuracy train predictive model base machine learn methodology primary outcome interested studying . Subjects : male female age 18-70 year age . Inclusion Criteria : Meet DSM IV criterion MDD Structured Clinical Interview DSM IV ( SCID ) capable provide informed consent Exclusion Criteria : Psychosis ; acute suicidal intent plan ; alcohol drug dependence within 3 month ; previous treatment 3 following : - adequate CBT - adequate trial study antidepressant medication [ adequacy definition : ≥ 4 week ) venlafaxine ≥150 mg/day , ii ) bupropion ≥150 mg/day iii ) escitalopram ≥ 10 mg/day iv ) duloxetine ≥ 30 mg/day v ) ≥ 8 CBT session ≥ 8 week - unstable medical illness - ECT within 6 month - pregnancy sexually active female use contraception . Study Design : Pre-treatment data collection : After 10 day psychotropic medication washout demographic , syndromatic , illness severity , biochemical/hematological electroencephalographic data collect list potential response predictor variable later extract . The data collect include follow area - Depression Severity : evaluate use Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) Beck II Depression Rating Scale . - Anxiety Severity : measure use Spielberger Stait-Trait Anxiety Index . - Diagnosis Syndromatic Features : document use Structured Clinical Interview DSM IV ( SCID ) . - Personality Attributes : determine use Minnestota Multi-phasic Personality Inventory ( MMPI ) NEO-Personality Inventory . - Social Support : measure use Perceived Social Support Friends Family rating scale ( PSS ) . - Previous Antidepressant Medication Treatment ( range adequacy ) : determine use modify updated version Michigan Adequacy Treatment Scale . - Hematological/Biochemical Testing : complete blood count , hepatic transaminase , thyroid stimulate hormone level , serum creatinine , serum calcium , serum magnesium , fast blood glucose serum B12 . Antidepressant Treatment : The antidepressant treatment administer Phase I . Subjects show le 50 % response treatment end Phase I receive different treatment Phase II . There 10 day period phase I II antidepressant medication ( used Phase I ) taper discontinue . Treatment choice make naturalistically i.e . patient preference take account , patient receive treatment previously fail respond adequate trial treatment . Subjects judge insufficiently `` psychologically mind '' offer CBT . If patient preference regard treatment , choice treatment determine randomly . Treatment option : ) escitalopram 6 week ii ) venlafaxine 6 week iii ) bupropion 6 week iv ) duloxetine 6 week v ) cognitive behaviour therapy ( CBT ) 12 week . Antidepressant medication dose follow establish medical procedure publish dose guideline . CBT administer manualized format highly trained therapist . Data Analysis : After treatment , subject classify responder non-reponders use % change MADRS score pre-treatment post treatment . Subjects consider responder post treatment MADRS score drop 50 % baseline score . The machine learn algorithm train use feature extract pre-treatment demographic , syndromatic , illness severity , biochemical/hematological electroencephalographic data Phase I treatment response classification variable . The algorithm first test use nested cross-validation `` leave N '' technique use Phase I data . Overfitting predictive algorithm entirely exclude possibility , even use nest cross validation method . For reason result algorithm test Phase II subject use predictive feature extract pre-treatment data , instance , use treatment response data Phase II treatment . The pre-treatment demographic , syndromatic , illness severity , biochemical/hematological electroencephalographic data data Phase II subject employ train algorithm treatment receive Phase I treatment receive Phase II . Under circumstance retesting algorithm use Phase II treatment outcome constitute test entirely independent sample .</detailed_description>
