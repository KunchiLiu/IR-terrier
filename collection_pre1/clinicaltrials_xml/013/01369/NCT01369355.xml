	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Efficacy Ustekinumab Maintenance Therapy Patients With Moderately Severely Active Crohn 's Disease ( IM-UNITI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main purpose study determine whether additional ustekinumab treatment beneficial patient moderately severely active Crohn 's disease initially clinical response IV ustekinumab one 2 initial induction study ( CNTO1275CRD3001 [ `` UNITI-1 '' ] CNTO1275CRD3002 [ `` UNITI-2 '' ] induction study ) . The maintenance treatment injection skin ( give subcutaneously , `` SC '' ) 90 mg ustekinumab either every 8 week 12 week , effect ( benefit side effect adverse event ) compare SC placebo injection ( otherwise identical except without ustekinumab ) . Patients respond IV ustekinumab UNITI-1 ( NCT01369329 ) UNITI-2 ( NCT01369342 ) induction study put one 3 group chance ( randomly , like roll dice ) . The study double-blinded ( neither patient study personnel know identity assign treatment ) . Patients randomize either SC placebo 90mg ustekinumab SC every 12 week experience worsen Crohn 's Disease symptom ( per study loss response criterion ) treatment adjust instead start receive 90mg ustekinumab SC every 8 week . All patient UNITI-1 UNITI-2 study ( addition patient describe responded IV ustekinumab ) eligible enter study , provide Week 8 visit trial complete study requirement still meet . Patients clinical response IV placebo ustekinumab UNITI-1 UNITI-2 receive IV SC study agent first visit study ( week 0 ) . Patients previously receive IV placebo receive ustekinumab 130 mg IV week 0 ( SC placebo ) , patient previously receive IV ustekinumab receive 90 mg ustekinumab SC week 0 ( well IV placebo ) . If patient clinical response 8 week later , receive 90 SC ustekinumab week8 visit , continue receive Ustekinumab ( every 8 week participant response IV Ustekinumab every 12 week participant response IV Placebo ) throughout rest study ( provide otherwise remain eligible ) . Patients clinical response IV placebo induction dose continue receive SC placebo . The main part study , also call maintenance portion , last 44 week . After week 44 , participant continue well eligible continue receive study agent second part study , long term extension study agent continue administer week 252 . Participants discontinue study agent , either study , week 252 , ask return final safety follow-up visit 20 week last receive study agent . Patients response IV ustekinumab randomize receive either placebo ( Group 1 ) , Ustekinumab 90 mg SC every 12 week ( Group 2 ) , Ustekinumab 90mgSC every 8 week ( Group 3 ) . If patient Groups 1 2 lose response , cross receive ustekinumab 90mg every 8 week . Other population ( nonresponders prior IV ustekinumab IV placebo ) receive ustekinumab Week0 ( either 90mg SC 130mg IV , respectively ) continue SC ustekinumab response Week 8 , Placebo IV responder continue receive Placebo SC q4w .</detailed_description>
