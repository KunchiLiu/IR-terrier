	<brief_title>Combination Therapy Pegylated Interferon Alfa-2a Tenofovir Versus Tenofovir Monotherapy Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study compare long-term efficacy treatment combination therapy peginterferon plus tenofovir versus tenofovir monotherapy treatment chronic hepatitis B . This randomize ( 1:1 ) parallel group design trial comparing ( ) Tenofovir DF 300 mg daily 192 week ( 4 year ) ( ii ) peginterferon alfa-2a 180 µg weekly 24 week plus Tenofovir DF 300 mg daily 192 week ( 4 year ) . Enrolled participant stratify HBeAg status ( positive/negative ) , genotype ( A vs. others ) cirrhosis ( present vs. absent ) . After 192 week treatment , participant meet criterion treatment discontinuation stop treatment follow 48 week ( total duration treatment follow 240 week ) . Emtricitabine/tenofovir coformulated Truvada , approve treatment HIV treatment HBV infection , offer patient primary nonresponse , partial virological response confirm virologic breakthrough .</detailed_description>
