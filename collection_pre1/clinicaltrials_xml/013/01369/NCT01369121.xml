	<brief_title>Tolerability Study Xerecept® Pediatric Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Steroid-related side effect much severe pediatric population adult . The side effect appear quickly often apparent 14 day . Dexamethasone side effect child include round face , acne , increase body hair , muscle weakness , osteoporosis , mood change , weight gain , fluid retention , glucose instability , high blood pressure , increase susceptibility infection , stunt growth aseptic necrosis hip joints14-16 . Although extensive study perform Xerecept® adult , study perform Xerecept® pediatric subject . Therefore , study conduct evaluate safety tolerability Xerecept® child central nervous system tumor identify appropriate dos Xerecept® use subsequent pediatric clinical trial . The study also explore Xerecept® , administer pediatric patient , effective allow decrease dexamethasone dose</detailed_description>
