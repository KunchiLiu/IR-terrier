	<brief_summary>Two hundred million adult worldwide major surgery every year . A million patient obvious stroke surgery . Another 10 million patient may `` silent '' stroke . Although silent stroke diagnose immediately , likely reduce patient ' short-term memory , concentration , ability function home . However , investigator know common silent stroke noncardiac surgery , extent affect brain function . The investigator first perform pilot trial determine feasibility large study provide definitive answer question . Participating patient assess questionnaire surgery , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study brain surgery look silent stroke . Combining result MRI questionnaires allow u determine frequency silent stroke non-cardiac surgery , effect brain function . The NeuroVISION Pilot Study determine feasibility large study examine frequency impact silent stroke patient undergo noncardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
