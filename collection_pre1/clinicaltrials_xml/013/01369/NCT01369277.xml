	<criteria>Healthy male and/or female subject nonchildbearing potential , age 18 55 year , inclusive ( Healthy define clinically relevant abnormality identify detailed medical history , full physical examination , include blood pressure pulse rate measurement , 12 lead ECG clinical laboratory test ) . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 17.5 30.5 kg/m2 ; total body weight &gt; 50 kg ( 110 lb ) . Japanese subject must four Japanese grandparent born Japan . Mean body weight body weight range Western subject must within Â±10 % Japanese subject . Evidence history clinically significant hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurologic , allergic disease ( include drug allergy , exclude untreated , asymptomatic , seasonal allergy time dose ) . Screening supine blood pressure &gt; =140 mm Hg ( systolic ) &gt; =90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , single measurement ( confirm single repeat , necessary ) follow least 5 minute rest . Any condition possibly affect drug absorption ( eg , gastrectomy ) . History regular alcohol consumption exceed 7 drinks/week female 14 drinks/week male ( 1 drink = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) hard liquor ) within 6 month screen . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day ( determined local requirement , whichever long ) 5 halflives precede first dose study medication . 12lead ECG demonstrate QTc &gt; 450 msec QRS interval &gt; 120 msec screening . If QTc exceed 450 msec , QRS exceed 120 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTc QRS value use determine subject 's eligibility . Pregnant nursing female woman childbearing potential .</criteria>
