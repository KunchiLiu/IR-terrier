	<brief_title>Curative Versus Disease-Modifying Therapies Children With Severe Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>sickle cell disease ( SCD ) , significant proportion experience clinically severe disease require aggressive intervention . Widely applicable curative therapy favorable toxicity profile remain elusive patient . Three distinct intervention strategy currently available child severe sickle cell disease ( SCD ) : oral hydroxyurea ( HU ) , chronic blood transfusion ( CT ) , allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) HLA-matched sibling donor ( MSD ) . Each intervention distinct advantage disadvantage . Many patient receive specific intervention , continue standard comprehensive care ( SCC ) . Though indication therapy overlap , date comparative outcome data , leave family physician without adequate information upon base therapeutic decision . The gold standard obtain data would randomize , prospective study compare intervention , though may may feasible conduct . Before trial consider , large cross-sectional trial conduct establish comparison among four therapeutic group ( HU , SCT , CT , SCC ) respect outcome clinicians family deem important . The research propose pilot study pediatric adolescent/young adult patient receive curative intervention ( MSD-SCT ) , disease-modifying intervention ( HU CT ) SCC ( control ) , respect three clinically important outcome : quality-of-life ( QOL ) , neurocognitive function , reproductive potential . Comparable cohort identify group , draw patient treated SCD program Children 's Healthcare Atlanta ( CHOA ) . QOL measure neuropsychiatric test administer . Reproductive endocrine function marker ( laboratory study pubertal stag ) , collect analyze . A track system patient also develop , gather available retrospective data set mechanism collection new data .</detailed_description>
