	<brief_summary>The active ingredient Shigella sonnei O-SP-core conjugate vaccine saccharide-protein conjugate compose fragment S. sonnei LPS . The saccharide component consist average 3.5 repeat unit O-SP plus core region LPS ( O-SPC ) . The O-SPC covalently bind recombinant non-toxic exoprotein B Clostridium difficile . The objective phase study determine vaccine safe induce IgG antibody type-specific immunity shigellosis adult . The overall objective determine vaccine elicit high level IgG antibody previous experimental vaccine make full length O-SP , show &gt; 70 % efficacious great equal to3 year old child , induce type-specific immunity shigellosis young child . Sixty 18-49 years-old healthy adult recruit Israel . Volunteers vaccinate random basis one i.m . injection 10 25 microgram investigational conjugate vaccine . Local systemic reaction observe 30 minute , volunteer instruct take temperature examine injection site redness swell fill questionnaire 6 , hour daily 7 day vaccination . The volunteer visit clinic 24 48 hour follow injection time request . The study commence 5 volunteer inject 10ug dose follow , severe adverse reaction occur , 5 volunteer inject 25ug dose . If severe adverse reaction occur 1 5 volunteer either group , 5 inject dose . If severe adverse reaction study proceed . If one severe reaction study halt re-evaluated IRB FDA . Vaccine-induced antibody measure 1 6 month immunization , compare elicit previous S. sonnei conjugate vaccine . There body evidence critical level serum IgG antibody O-specific polysaccharide domain LPS confer type-specific immunity S. sonnei well Shigella : 1 . Shigellosis rarely observe infant age 4-6 month . The obvious explanation maternally-derived serum IgG provide immunity ; 2 . There age-related development IgG anti-LPS antibody , many instance , induce homologous bacteria non-pathogenic cross-reacting enteric bacteria ; 3 . The high incidence , morbidity , mortality occur 6 month 6 year age maternally-derived serum anti-O-SP wan naturally-derived antibody yet appear ; 4 . One injection S. sonnei-rEPA conjugate show significant protection shigellosis Israeli Defense Force soldier . Vaccinees develop shigellosis show significantly low serum IgG responses homologous LPS not.The high antibody level induced conjugate vaccine indicate positive correlation serum IgG anti-LPS level immunity S. sonnei infection ; 5 . Following Phase 1 Phase 2 study show safety age-related immunogenicity , double-blinded randomize vaccine-controlled Phase 3 evaluation S. sonnei S. flexneri type 2a O-specific polysaccharide ( O-SP ) protein conjugate conduct among 1-4 year-olds Israel . For recipient S. sonnei conjugate 71.1 % efficacy show among 3-4 year-old recipient , efficacy show recipient S. flexneri 2a . There statistically significant efficacy either vaccine 1-3 year-olds .

Our interpretation age-related efficacy Shigella conjugate due conjugate-induced O-SP antibody level . Accordingly , develop method increase immunogenicity conjugate approach antibody level Israeli soldier show protected S. sonnei O-SP .
