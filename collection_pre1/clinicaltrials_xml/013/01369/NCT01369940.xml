	<brief_summary>Background : -Normal growth development twin important healthy pregnancy long-term health child . This study look twin grow develop inside womb . This knowledge may reduce and/or prevent pregnancy newborn health problem future . Objective : -To describe twin grow . To describe identical ( egg ) fraternal ( different egg ) twin grow . - To compare growth pattern twin single pregnancy . - To find many baby growth problem . Eligibility : -Women nine U.S. clinical center first three month twin pregnancy . Design : - Participants answer question personal characteristic ( age , education , race ) . They also answer question pregnancy history , health behavior , environment . This take 30 minute . They also fill questionnaire physical activity , mood depression . An ultrasound do check baby measurement . - Participants return six visit pregnancy . Each follow-up include ultrasound test measure length cervix . We ask question health event symptom since visit . We also take body measurement . - A nutrition questionnaire complete first visit follow-up visit 2 5 . - Blood drawn begin study , three follow-up visit , delivery . - When baby bear , placenta cord blood sample , measurement , swab inside mouth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The NICHD Fetal Growth Study : Twin Gestations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fetal growth important determinant health disease perinatal period , childhood adult life . NICHD conduct ultrasound study singleton pregnancy establish national standard normal fetal growth gestation interval velocity . Twins represent 3.2 % births U.S , pregnancy increase risk fetal growth disorder , preterm , importantly , preterm delivery . The rate small-for-gestational-age ( SGA ) define 10th percentile use singleton birth weight-for-gestational-age reference 35 % . Neonatal morbidity high twin gestation singleton ( 25.6 versus 4 per 1,000 ) , infant mortality rate also high ( 31 versus 6.4 per 1,000 ) . Discrepancy size twin birth frequent phenomenon , associate increase risk perinatal morbidity mortality . The trajectory fetal growth twin throughout gestation observe described study , use ultrasonography ultrasonography combine birth weight . The finding suggest slow growth almost twin 28-30 week gestation , even twin grow rate similar singleton 28 week may show slowed rate growth third trimester . It hypothesize pattern growth even well-growing twin normal down-regulation response constrict uterine environment may underscore need birth weight-for-gestational-age ultrasound reference specific twin . As singleton birth , however , slow-downs late pregnancy appear associate earlier delivery great risk morbidity associate preterm birth . This would argue separate reference twin , least , development growth velocity standard singleton twin allow accurate assessment interval growth well manage case . We propose conduct NICHD Fetal Growth Study Twin Gestations , prospective cohort study longitudinal measurement fetal growth conduct nine clinical center . Overall , four main research objective : 1 ) describe fetal growth trajectory twin use two- select three-dimensional ultrasound measure ; 2 ) compare contrast fetal growth trajectory twin newly establish fetal growth standard develop singleton determine applicability monitoring growth twin fetus discordant growth pair ; 3 ) estimate incidence growth restriction ( SGA proxy ) singleton twin gestation ( zygosity ) , however , growth restriction may define new growth standard ; 4 ) compare singleton twin gestation respect maternal biomarkers fetal growth , well-being maternal nutritional status use bank biospecimens determine biomarkers range establish singleton applicable twin gestation . This study recruit 350 pregnant woman twin gestation nine clinical center . The study design enroll approximately 350 dichorionic twin pair base upon incidence figure twin population level . Women recruit first trimester follow delivery . Serial ultrasound assessment fetal growth standard care twin pregnancy , coordinate timing research ultrasounds full extent possible clinical scan minimize exposure describe protocol . Each woman seven schedule ultrasound examination , include fetal biometry visit , fetal Doppler study , four blood draw baseline target gestational age eventual identification biomarkers indicative fetal growth . After delivery , neonatal anthropometric measure assess twin , select information obstetrical course newborn status abstract medical chart .</detailed_description>
