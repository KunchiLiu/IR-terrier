	<detailed_description>Pain control child major concern child chronic disease , cancer sickle cell disease frequent pain crisis . Additionally , though traditional pain medication morphine acetaminophen regard safe effective pain control child , alternative therapy available medication insufficient . Chronic pain ( whether cancer non-cancer pain ) child approve well tolerate therapeutic option proven efficacy . Ketamine medication first described 1962 [ 1 ] . It NMDA-R ( N-methyl-D-aspartate-receptor ) antagonist dissociative amnestic analgesic effect [ 1-2 ] . Ketamine particularly successful dissociative amnestic child emergent set little respiratory cardiac impact , short half-life , few psychomimetic effect pediatric population adult [ 1 ] . Its function via antagonism reduction NMDA-receptors afferent pain pathway . In effect , decrease pain receptor dramatically reduce need narcotic pain medication patient chronic pain . Unfortunately , dissociative effect , ketamine drug abuse decade [ 1,3 ] . Additionally , concern ketamine may long-term deleterious effect cognition subject chronically expose IV ketamine [ 4 ] , especially child whose neural pathway may still develop [ 1,5 ] . These effect may include difficulty attention work memory , though effect appear short-term reversible adult . However , much data derive rodent primate study , little evidence long-term cognitive effect human chronically expose ketamine [ 1 ] . This lack data particularly impactful pediatric group . Ketamine evaluate analgesic medication patient chronic pain resolve narcotic gabapentin . There number case report small case series suggest ketamine useful medication control chronic pain adult [ 2,4,6-8 ] . Additionally , case study describe last ( 12 week ) pain control adult 4-10 day ketamine therapy [ 7-8 ] . However , , date , little data aid pediatrician determine ketamine safe effective option chronic , oral therapy child chronic pain . Overall , proven safe effective medication use chronic pain management child . Ketamine well know medication well elaborate safety profile , give intravenously short period time . There , , emerge data ketamine useful chronic pain control adult . The question remain answered whether ketamine safe option chronic use child , whose brain significantly plastic whose metabolism different compare adult .</detailed_description>
