	<brief_summary>Background : -Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) inherit disorder affect men . People SBMA often weakness throughout body , include muscle use swallow , breathing , speak . We know exercise help harm people SBMA . Objective : -To see 12-week program either functional exercise stretching exercise improve strength , function , quality life people SBMA Eligibility : - Participants men 18 year age old genetic confirmation SBMA . - They must able walk least 50 foot without assistive device cane walker stand 10 minute without use assistive device . - They must access computer Internet connection . Design : - At first visit NIH ( 2 day ) , participant medical history take undergo physical exam . They also blood test EKG , complete questionnaire mood , health , exercise . Tests muscle strength , balance , endurance also do . - Participants qualify study receive instruction either strengthen stretching exercise . They exercise home one three time week 12 week . - They wear small activity monitor exercise record exercise diary . - At end 12 week , participant return NIH 2 day . They undergo test first visit . - Participants receive follow-up phone call e-mail study 4 week last visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) , Kennedy disease , slowly progressive , X-linked motor neuron disease currently treatment . It cause mutation androgen receptor result polyglutamine repeat expansion . The role exercise motor neuron disease research debate . Although SBMA believe primarily neuronopathy , potential effect aberrant androgen receptor activity muscle lead exercise uncertain utility population . Our objective examine safety efficacy exercise regimens Kennedy disease . Study Population : We aim enroll 80 men genetically confirm Kennedy disease . Design : This randomize , evaluator blind , trial 25 subject exercise arm . Following informed consent , subject undergo initial medical physical evaluation follow series neurological test blood work two-day outpatient visit NIH . The subject provide blood work analysis hormonal level assessment potential muscle damage . On second day visit , subject randomize taught series either functional stretching exercise engage part study control arm , respectively . Following baseline visit NIH , subject monitor throughout study telephone contact measure include video record monitor progress compliance . The subject return NIH end 12 week period time physical laboratory test repeat . After 12 week exercise period four week period follow-up participant telephone e-mail . At end trial subject inform study result give opportunity learn exercise find beneficial . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure use Adult Myopathy Assessment Tool ( AMAT ) . Secondary outcome measure involve quantitative muscle analysis ( QMA ) , Timed Up Go ( TUG ) test , quality life measure ( SF-36v2TM ) , adverse event questionnaire , Computerized Dynamic Posturography ( CDP ) assessment balance , accelerometer measurement exercise effort , progressive height sit-to-stand testing . Several exploratory biomarkers may affect exercise evaluate , include insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) , insulin-like growth factor bind protein 3 , testosterone , growth hormone , creatine kinase . Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) test also use determine subject mood affected exercise . Qualitative sub-study question , international index erectile function , Block brief food questionnaire , Aggression Questionnaire , Activities-specific Balance Confidence ( ABC ) scale , Fatigue Symptom Inventory , physical activity survey measure also employ .</detailed_description>
