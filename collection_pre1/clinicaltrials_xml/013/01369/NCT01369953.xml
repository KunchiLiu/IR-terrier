	<detailed_description>Since 2007 , cost sequencing diploid human genome fall dramatically , approximately $ 70 million $ 20,000 ( Illumina , 2010 ) . As affordable sequencing platform become widely available , advancement biomedical science draw increasingly whole genome sequence research require large cohort diverse population ( Lunshof et al. , 2009 ; Need &amp; Goldstein , 2009 ) . Key policy , ethical legal implication development need understood order promote efficacy effectiveness genomic research go forward . &lt; TAB &gt; In addition information well-understood region genome sought-after incidental whole genome sequence yield result probabilistic , uncertain , change significance indefinite period time . Sequence data useful share widely among investigator conjunction detailed clinical information ( Angrist , 2010 ) . It may implications individual family unclear clinical significance . As , boundary clinical research test dissolving , standard return test result research participants non-existent ( McGuire &amp; Lupski , 2010 ) . The difficulty acquire informed consent study involve whole genome sequence therefore topic active debate within biomedical research community . This propose study approach inform consent genomic medicine iterative construct shape civic value social norm . Understanding civic social context informed consent take place crucial order adapt new reality genomic research . An overall aim inquiry solicit feedback informed consent process early adopter whole genome sequencing research . A specific goal characterize salient personal public reference access participant around time informed consent process . By highlight trend relationship civic value social norm , aim advance development ethically socially relevant vocabulary broker term use personal sequence data . Participants recruit two NIH protocol employ whole genome sequence distinct purpose . The ClinSeqTM Study large-scale medical sequencing project investigate causal role genetics cardiovascular disease enrol symptomatic healthy individual . The Whole Genome Medical Sequencing Gene Discovery Study ( WGMS ) enroll child adult full sequence aim discover genetic etiology rare condition .</detailed_description>
