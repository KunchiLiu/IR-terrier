	<brief_summary>The purpose research project ass efficacy weight loss intervention chronic disease prevention focus daily self-weighing primary self-monitoring strategy compare delayed-intervention control group . While daily self-weighing show effective weight loss observational research , limit experimental evidence test association derive intensive intervention may overshadow effect self-weighing . To mitigate , investigator examine whether daily self-weighing effective weight loss self-directed condition use randomized-controlled design . The investigator conduct 6-month randomized trial 88 overweight obese adult compare daily self-weighing intervention delayed-intervention control group . Changes weight , diet physical activity , psychosocial measure examine . Main Study Hypothesis : Participants group randomize receive daily self-weighing intervention great percent weight loss 6 month compare delayed control group . Secondary Hypothesis : Participants group receive daily self-weighing intervention report great engagement diet physical activity behavior produce caloric deficit , great self-efficacy motivation , difference body satisfaction , disorder eating , depressive symptom compare control group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The WEIGH Study : Weighing Improve Gain Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity continue challenge public health problem . Despite produce large reduction weight , weight loss intervention require significant amount effort detail self-monitoring dietary intake exercise habit involve . Consequently , behavior difficult sustain weight regain occurs . Interventions focus enhance simple strategy self-monitoring may effective provide lasting effect . One simple form self-monitoring self-weighing . Self-weighing important tool regulation body weight provide proximal feedback eat exercise behavior impact weight , allow individual make adjustment behavior affect energy balance . Observational research indicate daily self-weighing associate great weight loss compare less frequent self-weighing . However , limited experimental evidence test association derive intensive intervention may overshadow effect self-weighing . To mitigate , investigator examine whether daily self-weighing effective self-directed condition minimal contact . The result proposal provide evidence efficacy daily self-weighing weight loss use randomize controlled design . Most assessment self-weighing measured via self-report , introduces measurement error . This proposal improve use objective measure self-weighing scale store transmit weight data . Given self-weighing impact weight loss directly rather via change diet physical activity behavior , full understanding mechanism explain relationship necessary . Furthermore , despite evidence indicate frequent self-weighing adverse psychological effect adult participate weight control intervention , remain debate negative psychological consequence behavior . Therefore , would informative test adverse effect treatment group add evidence surround debate . The objective WEIGH Study ( Weighing Improve Gain Health ) test efficacy self-directed intervention focus daily self-weighing main self-monitoring strategy weight loss 6 month compare delayed-intervention control group . This test use 2-group randomize control design . Participants randomly assign either : [ 1 ] Daily Self-weighing Intervention Group [ 2 ] Delayed-Intervention control group . The daily self-weighing intervention group receive access `` smart scale '' daily self-weighing viewing weight trend time , receive weekly email tailor message reinforce self-weighing behavior associate reach weight loss goal . This group also receive weekly lesson basic information weight loss strategy use scale maximize weight loss . The control group give `` smart scale '' tell weigh often normally , goal observe natural weigh frequency trend group . After end 6-month study , receive 3-month modified version daily self-weighing intervention , include weekly email , prescription daily self-weighing , weight monitoring via smart scale website . Detailed description component outline . Recruitment Informed Consent Participants first undergo screen www.uncweightresearch.org via Qualtrics call study center complete screen questionnaire phone . For fill questionnaire online , still require call study center complete screening questionnaire , sensitive medical-related question appropriate ask phone . Once consider eligible , participant invite orientation session hear program ask question decide whether participate . For want participate , study PI and/or study personnel list application explain consent form ask participant read form . Once participant finish read form , study personnel member ask participant he/she question . Then party sign questionnaire participant receive copy consent form . Randomization Consented individual provide Qualtrics link complete baseline questionnaire measure . A computer algorithm randomly assign one two study group . Baseline anthropometrics measure kick-off session randomization reveal participant . At 3 6-month assessment , enrol patient repeat baseline measure , exception demographic characteristic . At 9 month , participant group ask stop smart scale provide final weight measurement control group complete 1 final questionnaire . Following randomization , participant either receive component outline intervention group delayed-intervention control group . Detailed Descriptions Intervention Components Kick-off Group Meeting Initially , individual attend group kick-off meeting receive scale ( see ) material get start . This meeting also emphasize objective study , examine effect self-directed approach weight loss emphasize daily self-weighing . The kick-off session provide participant start-up guide use scale well access study website ( www.bodytrace.com ) view weight trend overtime . The session focus benefit daily self-weighing weight loss , address certain myth regard daily self-weighing emphasizing use scale barometer progress diet physical activity behavior . In addition , session also provide brief overview `` Weight Loss 101 '' discussion focus calorie balance , outline Diabetes Prevention Program material . Smart Scales Participants intervention group instruct weigh daily use `` smart '' scale . These scale send weight data directly website ( www.bodytrace.com ) via wireless cellular network . Participants able view weight scale also utilize website view weight trend overtime . Participants loan scale , tell consent form able keep smart scale upon completion study assessment visit . Participants tell complete assessment visit , ask return UNC Weight Research Program . Intervention Weekly Emails All intervention participant receive weekly email include basic skill train material weight control , tailor feedback base rate weight loss daily self-weighing frequency . The skill train material include instructional lesson topic portion control , label reading , restaurant eating , structure exercise , lifestyle activity , behavioral topic problem solving , stimulus control relapse prevention . The behavioral topic base evidence base Diabetes Prevention Program . This program use various research study , include conduct UNC Weight Research Program . Additionally , investigator reinforce self-weighing behavioral weight control topic enhance self-regulation . The emails begin tailor feedback message daily self-weighing frequency message reinforce daily self-weighing help participant respond effectively weight change learn utilize scale make adjustment diet physical activity behavior order produce caloric deficit . An algorithm base self-weighing frequency compliance determine feedback message receive Diet Physical Activity Level Suggestions Participants intervention group also receive example meal plan calorie level associate weight loss ( e.g. , 1200-1800 calorie per day ) give suggestion meal plan follow base baseline weight , Furthermore , participant provide physical activity goal 150-250 minute per week exercise similar brisk walking , level show associated weight loss . They encourage begin 10 minute walk day add 5 minute per day week reach 150-200 minute . For example , Week 1 walk 10 minute x 5 day ( 50 minute ) , Week 2 walk 15 minute x 5 day ( 75 minute ) , Week 3 walk 20 minute x 5 day ( 100 minute ) , etc . Delayed-Intervention Control Group The delayed-intervention control group receive kick-off session tell study test self-directed approach weight loss focus careful track weight , receive modify version intervention 6-month period complete . They also provide `` smart scale '' website access ( bodytrace.com ) , tell use normally would , investigator could get sense normal weigh habit . They tell investigator able view weigh frequency bodytrace.com website . They receive modify version intervention 3 month , include component intervention group exception weekly feedback email . After 3 month , investigator call and/or email participant ask step scale provide final weight complete 1 final questionnaire process measure .</detailed_description>
