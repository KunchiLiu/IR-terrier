	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) combination therapy bendamustine ( bendamustine hydrochloride ) -rituximab relapse chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) patient . ( Phase I ) II . To assess rate complete response ( CR ) MK-2206 combination bendamustine-rituximab relapse CLL SLL patient . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical efficacy MK-2206 combination bendamustine-rituximab demonstrate analysis overall response rate ( CR , complete response incomplete bone marrow recovery [ CRi ] , clinical complete response [ CCR ] , near partial response [ nPR ] partial response [ PR ] ) , duration response , treatment free survival . II . To assess toxicity profile MK-2206 combination bendamustine-rituximab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluation whether establish CLL prognostic factor ( cluster differentiation [ CD ] 38 , CD49d , immunoglobulin heavy chain variable [ IGHV ] , fluorescence situ hybridization [ FISH ] zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 [ ZAP-70 ] ) predict response combination therapy MK2206 , bendamustine-rituximab . II . Minimal residual disease evaluate treatment patient achieve clinical response ; minimal residual disease ( MRD ) status explore relation quality duration response . III . Evaluation effect addition MK-2206 bendamustine-rituximab B cell receptor initiate , phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /Akt downstream signal pathway , apoptosis analysis leukemic cell activation status , well multiple cytokine profile key gene expression analysis focus leukemic cell . IV . Evaluation marrow stromal cell ( MSC ) -CLL biology include effect addition MK-2206 bendamustine-rituximab CLL marrow stromal cell ( MSC ) proliferation , migration cytokine production , well adhesion capacity MSC leukemic cell . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study Akt inhibitor MK2206 follow phase II study . Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ( day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 course 1 ) ; rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 ( day 8 course 1 ) ; bendamustine hydrochloride IV 30-60 minute day 1-2 ( day 8-9 course 1 ) . Treatment repeat every 28 day ( 35 day course 1 84 day course 6 ) 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 12 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
