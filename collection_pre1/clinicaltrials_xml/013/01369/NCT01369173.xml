	<brief_summary>The food eat daily consider `` dietary pattern '' culture country . The dietary pattern Mexico different United States . To look effect pattern , participant study eat Mexican menu three half week American menu length time . At begin end menu period participant provide blood urine sample analyze compare effect diet .

	<detailed_description>Chronic disease risk , include breast cancer risk , uniform across race ethnic group United States . This variation disease risk may due environmental exposure ( include diet ) , genetic susceptibility , disparities access health screening , diagnosis medical care , combination factor . Here show Hispanic woman U.S. likely overweight obese compare non-Hispanic white . Some excess obesity risk likely due lack neighborhood availability affordability fruit , vegetable , lean protein whole grain . Whether inexpensive widely available highly processed/refined , nutrient poor diet superimpose genetic background favor adipose deposition ( i.e. , `` thrifty genotype '' ) metabolically detrimental investigate . Research test metabolic response Indigenous Western diet Hispanic woman may provide important information etiology obesity obesity-related disease Hispanic woman , include risk breast cancer . Since reduce disparity obesity-related disease , include breast cancer , important public health goal , identify potential program prevention receive high priority . Mexicans large immigrant group United States estimate 10 million Mexican-American woman currently U.S. As acculturate country , Mexican immigrant change dietary habit traditional ( indigenous ) food plentiful fruit , vegetable complex carbohydrate rich fiber compound Western-style diet high fat refine carbohydrate , low plant food . Particularly concern food choice make Mexican immigrant , many low socio-economic status , driven partly inability procure purchase healthy food . The disparity food availability purchase power fuel tendency obtain consume low-cost , Western style diet . When diet superimpose person `` thrifty genotype '' evolutionarily adapt diet high legume complex carbohydrate , may lead abnormal metabolic response favor adipose deposition numerous health risk . Thus , ancestral genetic characteristic likely important role metabolic response specific dietary pattern subsequent health risk . This phenomenon may partly explain tendency Mexicans immigrant Americas become obese one generation United States .</detailed_description>
