	<brief_title>Health Explorer - Optimizing Alcohol Brief Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although high proportion patient see Emergency Departments ( EDs ) at-risk problem alcohol use , screen receive service brief intervention ( BI ) design help cut-back stop drinking . EDs routinely provide BIs , perhaps due feasibility challenge train staff , monitoring fidelity , maintain system ensure longer-term implementation . Alcohol BIs find efficacious effective variety health care setting . However , evidence use ED mixed . There press need develop efficacious strategy screen optimally deliver alcohol BIs fast-paced widely-used setting . Existing clinician-delivered BI strategy need modify standardized administer high fidelity minimal demand ED staff time resource . Computer-delivered BIs one method address challenge inherent deliver intervention healthcare setting . The propose study use computerize screen via touch-screen computer tablet audio recruit inner-city ED patient screen positive at-risk problem alcohol use . Participants age 21-65 randomize one three condition : 1 ) Computer-delivered brief intervention ( CBI ) ; 2 ) Therapist-delivered brief intervention ( TBI ) ; 3 ) Enhanced usual care ( EUC ) . All participant receive write information regard community resource ; individual meet alcohol abuse/dependence criterion also receive alcohol treatment referral . Stratified random assignment [ gender ; meet criterion alcohol use disorder ] take place baseline condition . The rigorous examination efficacy therapist- vs. computer-delivered BIs , include potential moderator mediator , address key limitation raise previous trial determine optimal modality wide implementation brief alcohol intervention venue . Because ED important portal entry medical care system , particularly inner-city patient , delivery efficacious alcohol BIs emphasize key motivational interviewing component minimize staff resource could major public health impact .</detailed_description>
