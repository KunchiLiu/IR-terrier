	<brief_summary>Tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib use treatment renal cell carcinoma significant off-target effect cardiac toxicity resultant ventricular cardiac dysfunction major concern . However , mechanisms effect human remain poorly define , clinical method risk stratify identify patient ultimately suffer cardiac dysfunction . The goal multi-center study characterize cardiovascular measure cardiac function ; 2 ) comprehensive measure arterial function leave ventricular afterload ; 3 ) biomarkers reflective pathophysiologic alteration . Through work , investigator translate basic understanding sunitinib cardiotoxicity human identify early predictor sunitinib cardiotoxicity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tyrosine kinase inhibitor sunitinib dramatically improve overall management certaincancers include renal cell carcinoma . However , recent data suggest therapieshave significant off-target effect cardiac toxicity , include significant hypertension ventricular cardiac dysfunction major concern . However , biologic mechanism underlie cardiotoxicty human remain poorly define . Moreover , critical need develop method improve risk stratification early identification patient suffer hypertension cardiac dysfunction exposure therapy . The objective ofthis study characterize cardiovascular change occur sunitinib exposure order improve understand sunitib toxicity determine early , mechanistically clinically relevant predictor identify patient increase risk hyptertension cardiac dysfunction . The specific aim study : 1 ) To define change arterial hemodynamics may occur exposure sunitinib , 2 ) To define change sensitive echocardiographic measure cardiac function may occur exposure sunitinib , 3 ) To determine blood marker associate change vasculature cardiac function exposure sunitinib . 4 ) To determine early imaging biomarker predictor subitinib cardiotoxicity .</detailed_description>
