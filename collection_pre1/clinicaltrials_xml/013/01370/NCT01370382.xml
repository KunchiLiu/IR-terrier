	<brief_summary>The plan cohort study shall clarify whether use biomarkers lead improved diagnostic assessment elderly patient . The study evaluate clinical value biomarkers ( highly sensitive Troponin T , Troponin T 4th generation ) elderly patient . These biomarkers analyze together symptoms parameter collect admission . The diagnosis myocardial infarction could make earlier accurately help biomarkers , particular highly sensitive troponin T .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between New Highly Sensitive Troponin T Conventional Troponin T Test Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All consecutive patient acute symptoms age 70 year recruit study 6 month . Medical history , physical examination , vital sign include heart rate , blood pressure , body temperature , concomitant disease raise admission Emergency Department . Blood sample take determination routine laboratory . Highly sensitive troponin T determine part routine . Troponin T measure blood sample conventional test 4th generation . A second blood sample take part routine 4-6 hour onset symptom confirm rule acute coronary syndrome . Patients divide accord interval onset symptom presentation hospital `` early '' ( &lt; 4 hour ) `` late '' ( &gt; = 4 hour ) group . The Barthel Index geriatric assessment raise . An electrocardiogram write patient record evaluate . An echocardiographic examination perform patient measurement heart valve function , leave ventricular diameter , ejection fraction ( LVEF ) diastolic function differentiate mechanism release troponin . According result echocardiographic examination , patient divide sub-groups ( LV-EF &gt; = 55 % ) without preserve ejection fraction ( LVEF &lt; 55 % ) . The record physician estimate receive result investigation routine laboratory whether myocardial infarction heart failure present . He subsequently make decision treatment . The medical record evaluate completion stay hospital two experienced cardiologist , whether heart attack , heart failure disease present . High sensitivity Troponin T Troponin T 4th generation compare early correct diagnosis acute coronary syndrome . Objectives : 1 . Incidence acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation elderly patient use highly sensitive biomarker troponin T , 2 . Comparison incidence acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment elevation group use troponin T 4th generation 3 . Survey differential diagnosis heart failure cardiac disease .</detailed_description>
