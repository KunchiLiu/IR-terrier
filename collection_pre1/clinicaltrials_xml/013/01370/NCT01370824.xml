	<brief_summary>Skin cancer common cancer Caucasians . Basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) frequent skin cancer around 44.000 new tumour per year Netherlands , incidence still rise . Prior treatment , punch biopsy ( PB ) take suspected lesion , order determine subtype BCC . There three different histological subtypes BCC , least aggressive : superficial , nodular aggressive . Based aggressive subtype see PB , suitable surgical margin choose . Surgical excision ( SE ) treatment first choice BCC subtypes accord Dutch guideline . Recent development non-invasive therapy superficial BCC might first choice treatment future . These non-invasive treatment ( photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , Imiquimod 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) ) well cosmetic result SE therefore also use Maastricht University Medical Center . Drawback high recurrence rate SE . As nodular aggressive subtypes grow deep dermis , treat SE 3 mm 5 mm margin respectively . If BCC locate H-zone , treatment Mohs micrographic surgery ( MMS ) . Unfortunately , 30 % subtypes see PB correspond subtype see subsequent SE/MMS . The consequence overtreatment undertreatment . A potential good equal way determine BCC subtype might clinical diagnosis . To knowledge , literature diagnostic value clinical diagnosis determine subtype BCC see SE/MMS specimen . We want confirm hypothesis clinical diagnosis good , even well histological diagnosis PB determine BCC subtype subsequent SE/MMS . In case , patient n't undergo extra procedure , diagnostic route shorten . - Primary objective : establish observed agreement clinical diagnosis compare histological diagnosis determine aggressive subtype BCC - Secondary objective : inter-observer intra-observer variability dermatologist pathologists determine subtype BCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Basal cell carcinoma throughout world : Skin cancer common form cancer , basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) frequent form skin cancer , incidence still rise without future sign plateau . Because national registry BCC Netherlands , incidence rate derive register centre southern part country . From recent study know approximately 26.625 new patient BCCs occur 2006 Netherlands . The average number BCC per patient 1.65 , result 44.000 new BCCs year . With increase approximately 10 % per year estimate incidence rate 2011 around 70.800 Netherlands . Three important histopathologic subtypes BCC distinguish , namely superficial , nodular aggressive . In past , nodular basal cell carcinoma ( nBCC ) common histopathologic subtype , superficial basal cell carcinoma ( sBCC ) aggressive basal cell carcinoma ( aBCC ) subtypes fast grow incidence . Nowadays , distribution histopathologic subtypes BCC 40.6 % nodular , 30.7 % superficial 28.7 % aggressive . The shift nodular BCCs subtypes need accurate detection correct subtype , treatment per subtype different . The sharp raise incidence 10 % annually make BCC even big health problem near future . - Diagnosis BCC : BCC diagnose 3 mm punch biopsy ( PB ) suspect skin lesion . Based aggressive histopathologic subtype see biopsy , appropriate treatment chosen . Three subtypes relevant suitable treatment choice : superficial , nodular aggressive . The last one include BCCs aggressive growth , infiltrative/morpheaform BCC , micronodular BCC , BCC squamous differentiation . Unfortunately , 31-33 % histopathologic subtypes see punch biopsy primary recurrent BCCs correspond subtype see subsequent surgical excision ( SE ) / Mohs micrographic surgery ( MMS ) . The consequence overtreatment undertreatment . - Guidelines treatment basal cell carcinoma : The national advisory board Dutch dermatologists plastic surgeon publish multidisciplinary guideline treatment BCCs 2007 . In guideline different treatment option sort BCCs discuss conclusion draw treatment option . Recommended treatment BCCs regardless histopathological subtype SE . Both sBCC nBCC excise 3 mm margin aggressive subtypes need 5 mm margin . BCCs H-zone excise MMS . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , Imiquimod 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) also option sBCC low-risk site well cosmetic results.Recent study show overall estimate treatment success 5-year follow-up 65 % PDT 78-80 % Imiquimod . These percentage far low 99 % overall estimate treatment success SE sBCC . There literature treatment effect 5-FU long term follow-up . Only two study report 86-87 % complete response rate different 5-FU treatment regimens 6-12 week . - Treatment basal cell carcinoma Maastricht University Medical Center ( MUMC ) : In past , BCC disease elderly patient consequence recreational sun exposure tan bed , young patient develop skin cancer well . Therefore , cosmetic result play important role choose suitable treatment . Therefore today 's dermatologic practice MUMC patient sBCC treat non-invasively PDT , Imiquimod , 5-FU SE/MMS . These non-invasive treatment show good cosmetic result high recurrence rate SE . Any non-responding recurrent sBCC retreat SE/MMS . - Undertreatment overtreatment : Preliminary data study show case discrepancy histopathologic BCC subtype PB excision , 58 % patient overtreated 42 % undertreated . Half overtreated patient histological nBCC aBCC PB , superficial SE/MMS . This could partly due fact suspect part already biopsied present surgical excision anymore . Overtreatment consist unnecessary tissue loss wide SE margin . In addition , large excision might lead complication like scar , infection , continue subsequent bleeding dehiscent wound . Undertreated patient re-treated case positive resection margin SE , result extra stress patient , time health care cost . - Clinical diagnosis : Histological diagnosis BCC subtype PB might perfect procedure 30 % mismatch subtype see SE/MMS . A potential good way determine BCC subtype might clinical diagnosis . To knowledge , literature observe agreement clinical diagnosis determine aggressive histological subtype BCC . We want confirm hypothesis clinical diagnosis good even well histological diagnosis PB determine aggressive BCC subtype . Confirmation hypothesis result clinical diagnosis instead punch biopsy , patient receive early correct treatment , save time health care cost . The conclusion propose study serve basis update guideline diagnosis BCC .</detailed_description>
