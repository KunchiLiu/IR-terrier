	<brief_summary>This chronic , prospective , non-randomized feasibility study design evaluate Integrated Patient Care ( IPC ) concept subject already either Medtronic Chronicle Implantable Hemodynamic Monitor ( IHM ) Chronicle Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator ( ICD ) device implant , currently enrol Chronicle Offers Management Patients Advanced Signs &amp; Symptoms Heart Failure ( COMPASS-HF ) Extension Phase Study ( IDE # G020304 ) . The purpose study use daily cardiac fill pressure Chronicle device provide timely medication adjustment ( diuretic ) subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Integrated Patient Care ( IPC ) System Using Daily Filling Pressures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects ask transmit CareLink Network daily . Data specific study ( subject 's daily estimate Pulmonary Arterial Diastolic ( ePAD ) pressure value ) extract CareLink database transfer IPC clinician website . As subject enrol , clinician participate site determine appropriate target pressure range subject base review subject 's pressure data . Each day enrollment , subject 's current pressure data compare target pressure range clinician set subject . The patient instruction set ( PtIS ) limit daily diuretic prescription associate supplement , per physician discretion . The PtIS include adjustment non-heart failure medication include heart failure medication indicate day-to-day adjustment ( e.g . ACE-Inhibitors , Angiotensin Receptor Blockers ( ARBs ) , Beta-Blockers ) . The PtIS send IPC clinician website subject Patient Home Monitor .</detailed_description>
