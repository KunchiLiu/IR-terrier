	<brief_summary>People swallow impairment experience particular difficulty swallow thin liquid safely ; fast flow liquid make difficult control . The tongue play critical role contain liquid mouth , channel direction flow towards pharynx ( throat ) control flow along channel . The investigator engage program research well understand tongue function swallowing , particularly respect control flow liquid . In study investigator compare two different tongue-pressure resistance training protocol , determine whether protocol emphasize strength-and-accuracy one emphasize pressure time work well improve liquid flow control swallow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Drinking thin liquid something u take grant ; yet task one many patient dysphagia ( swallow impairment ) safely . Instead , individual receive liquid thicken form : thickened juice , thicken coffeeâ€¦ even thickened water . The literature tell u patient dislike taste feel thicken liquid find thirst quench . Patients thicken liquid prone inadequate fluid intake dehydration . Many patient non- compliant drink thin liquid , despite document risk aspiration ( i.e. , airway invasion ) consequence . Given limitation , important dysphagia researcher continue pursue treatment potential restore safe functional thin liquid swallow people dysphagia . In past decade , tongue pressure resistance training emerge innovative treatment dysphagia . Dr. JoAnne Robbins ( University Wisconsin - Madison ) show 8-weeks intensive tongue pressure resistance training improve tongue strength healthy senior dysphagia follow stroke . In lab ( Swallowing Rehabilitation Research Laboratory Toronto Rehabilitation Institute ) , investigator study variation Dr. Robbins ' treatment call `` Tongue Pressure Strength Accuracy Training '' . This approach also improve tongue strength improve aspiration . However , investigator continue bother fact people dysphagia post stroke often difficulty control flow thin liquid , even strength-focused protocol tongue-pressure training . The investigator recently complete study tongue pressure profile ( strength timing ) healthy people , show tongue pressure release slowly thin liquid thick liquid . This reveal active control thin liquid flow , suggest strength time tongue pressure play role flow-control . The investigator believe treatment outcome may better tongue pressure resistance training protocol take strength timing consideration . To end , investigator recently identify subset tongue pressure training task strength time profile tongue pressure onset release similar see liquid swallow . The investigator propose treatment protocol well potential yield favourable outcome thin liquid flow-control focus task . In study , investigator want determine whether tongue pressure profile training , address time amplitude issue tongue pressure generation , yield well functional outcome swallow strength-and-accuracy focus treatment . The investigator pursue question small randomize prospective trial , build prior work area . The investigator recruit 60 new patient demonstrate thin liquid flow-control difficulty secondary stroke . These individual randomize either tongue-pressure strength-and-accuracy training ( TPSAT ) novel intervention , tongue-pressure profile training ( TPPT ) . The investigator study treatment outcomes 12 week ( 24-sessions ) treatment .</detailed_description>
