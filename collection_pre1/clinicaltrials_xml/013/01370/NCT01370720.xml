	<brief_summary>Despite pathophysiology IBS remain largely unsettled , several mechanism propose explain symptom generation . These include psychosocial factor , alter gastrointestinal motor function alter perception visceral stimulus chronic low-grade inflammation increase nociceptive mediator release inflammatory cell , particularly mast cell . The aim pilot study provide evidence : 1. intestinal mast cell ( MC ) infiltration activation IBS patient ; 2. down-modulation MC activation oral administration association palmitoylethanolamide ( PEA ) polydatin IBS patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The number inflammatory cell gut wall IBS patient increase comparison asymptomatic control . A significant increase number mast cell T-lymphocytes mucosa IBS patient report . Electron microscopic study demonstrate mast cell frequently degranulated IBS , suggest increase state activation . Accordingly , increase mucosal release preform mediator , histamine tryptase , well de novo synthesis secretion arachidonic acid end product ( e.g . prostaglandin E2 ) demonstrate . These mediator know target sensory nerve pathway , include innervate gastrointestinal tract , lead visceral hyperalgesia . Electron microscopic study show mean distance inflammatory cell enteric nerve significantly reduce IBS patient , thus provide conceptual basis putative pathogenetic role low-grade inflammation sensory-motor dysfunction IBS . Activated mast cell close proximity mucosal colonic innervation correlate frequency severity abdominal pain . Evidence mast cell mediator IBS patient , control , evoke activation nociceptive sensory afferent neuron available , thus provide possible mechanism mast cell evoke pain IBS patient . Similar result recently report following administration rat colon supernatant collect human IBS colonic biopsy sample culture . This nociceptive effect murine sensory neuron inhibit serine protease inhibitor Protease Activating Receptor-2 antagonist .</detailed_description>
