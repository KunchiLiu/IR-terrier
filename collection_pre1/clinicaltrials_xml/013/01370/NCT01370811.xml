	<brief_title>A Relative Efficacy Safety Study OC Oral Solution Sialorrhoea Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sialorrhea excessive flow saliva associate unintentional loss mouth , commonly know drooling . Sialorrhea may result combination hypersecretion , problem swallow sensorimotor problem contain saliva mouth . It commonly find people neurological dysfunction Parkinson 's Disease , lead social isolation embarrassment . In general , treatment option limit underlie chronic disease . The objective propose low-dose , new combination drug , OC Oral solution develop new treatment option use titrate saliva secretion rate level low enough prevent unintentional loss ( i.e . drool ) low cause uncomfortably dry mouth .</detailed_description>
