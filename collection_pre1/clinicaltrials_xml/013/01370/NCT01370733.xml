	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate safety efficacy synchronize transcranial magnetic stimulation ( sTMS ) use NeoSync EEG Synchronized TMS device ( NEST ) subject Major Depressive Disorder . This multicenter study subject randomize receive treatment 5 day per week 6 week . Subjects complete 6 week double-blind treatment may eligible receive four week open label sTMS therapy antidepressant medication follow-up phase study . Follow-up evaluation visit conduct four week , frequency visit determine treatment choice timeframe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Synchronized Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( sTMS ) Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) mental disorder associate significant functional impairment disability . Affected individual present depress mood , loss interest pleasure , feeling guilt , low self-worth , disturbed sleep appetite , low energy , poor concentration . Psychopharmacological therapy today 's mainstream treatment revolutionize clinical management major depressive disorder show improve quality life many patient . With , therapy effective patient . Results release Sequenced Treatment Alternatives Relieve Depression Study ( STAR*D ) , conduct National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) , show approximately 30 % depressed subject respond SSRI first trial , despite adequate dose duration treatment . The SSRI antidepressant favorable side effect profile old medication , still may difficult patient tolerate gastrointestinal distress , anxiety , insomnia , sexual dysfunction . In addition psychopharmacologic treatment depression , therapy electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) show therapeutic effect MDD . ECT induce seizure electrically anesthetized subject . It generally safe effective ; however procedure negative side effect memory loss confusion . Treatment repetitive stimulation ( rTMS ) intend stimulate group cell area brain link MDD . While therapy non-invasive , expensive , involve complex method locate point stimulation brain , potential seizure . rTMS use magnetic pulse cause neuronal activation specific area brain . It generally believe activation cause reset cortical oscillator create therapeutic effect MDD . The investigator hypothesize TMS use low energy , sinusoidal magnetic field synchronize patient 's individual alpha frequency , ( sTMS ) , also affect neuronal activity lead reemergence intrinsic rhythms clinical improvement MDD . Preliminary study result use sTMS show improvement depressive symptom minimal side effect . This multicenter study design evaluate safety efficacy sTMS subject Major Depressive Disorder . Subjects randomize receive treatment 5 day per week 6 week . At end Treatment Week 6 , subject complete study treatment offer open label sTMS therapy alternate antidepressant treatment clinically indicate . At minimum , subject ask return one follow-up visit four week last double-blind treatment ( Week 10 ) evaluation study completion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects meet DSMIVTR primary diagnosis initial recurrent Major Depressive Disorder DSMIVTR criterion render structure interview use Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) . HAMD17 score &gt; = 17 Item 1 score great equal 2 . Duration current episode &gt; =8 week . The definition episode demarcate period &gt; =2 month subject meet full criterion DSMIVTR definition Major Depressive Episode . Maximum duration current episode exceed 2 year . The baseline EEG sufficient duration quality process quantitative analysis . Subjects willing able adhere intensive treatment schedule require study visit . Subjects unable unwilling give inform consent . Diagnosed follow condition ( current unless otherwise state ) : Any current primary Axis I mood , anxiety , psychotic disorder , include bipolar disorder . Depression secondary general medical condition , substanceinduced . History substance abuse dependence within past 6 month ( except nicotine caffeine ) . Any bipolar disorder psychotic disorder ( lifetime ) , include schizoaffective disorder , major depression psychotic feature previous episode . Eating disorder ( current within past year ) . Obsessive compulsive disorder ( lifetime ) . Posttraumatic stress disorder ( current within past year ) . ADHD ( currently treat ) . Subjects meet criterion Axis II cluster A B diagnosis base upon DSMIV TR criterion , judgment Investigator may hinder subject complete procedure require study protocol . Subjects clinically define neurological disorder include , limited : Any condition likely associate increase intracranial pressure . Space occupy brain lesion . Any history seizure EXCEPT therapeutically induce ECT ( childhood febrile seizures acceptable subject may include study ) . History stroke . Transient ischemic attack within two year . Cerebral aneurysm . Dementia . Mini Mental Status Exam ( MMSE2 ) score = &lt; 24 . Parkinson 's disease . Huntington 's disease . Multiple sclerosis . Increased risk seizure reason , include prior diagnosis increase intracranial pressure ( large infarction trauma ) , currently take medication lower seizure threshold . Medications low seizure threshold include Prohibited Concomitant Medication ( Section 5.7 ) . Subjects currently hospitalize due severity depression symptom . Subjects follow treatment history : TMS treatment within 6 month prior screen visit . ECT treatment within 1 year prior screen visit . Failure respond TMS ECT treatment ( i.e. , consistent ATHF confidence level 3 high ) previous episode . Lifetime history treatment Deep Brain Stimulation Vagus Nerve Stimulation . Use investigational drug device within 4 week randomization visit . Subjects treat fluoxetine within past four week . If participate psychotherapy , must stable treatment least 2 month prior entry study , anticipation change frequency therapeutic session , therapeutic focus duration trial . Failure respond Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors ( MAOIs ) current episode . Use medication ( ) list Prohibited Concomitant Medication within 1 week randomization . Subjects adequately benefiting current antidepressant medication ( ) . Significant acute suicide risk , define : Suicide attempt within previous 6 month require medical treatment ; Greater equal 1 suicide attempt past 12 month ; Has clearcut plan suicide state he/she guarantee he/she call his/her regular psychiatrist Investigator impulse implement plan become substantial study ; In Investigator 's opinion , likely attempt suicide within next 6 month . Cardiac pacemaker , implanted medication pump , intracardiac line , acute , unstable cardiac disease . Intracranial implant ( e.g. , aneurysm clip , shunt , stimulators , cochlear implant , stent , electrode ) metal object within near head , exclude mouth , safely remove . Clinically significant abnormality clinically significant unstable medical condition , indicate medical history , physical examination , ECG result , clinical laboratory testing , Investigator 's judgment might pose potential safety risk subject limit interpretation trial result , e.g. , uncontrolled thyroid disorder , hepatic , cardiac , pulmonary renal malfunctioning . Women currently pregnant use medically acceptable mean birth control woman breastfeed . Positive urine drug screen illicit substance . ( A positive urine drug screen screen may repeat prior randomization ) . Any condition judgment Investigator would prevent subject completion study .</criteria>
