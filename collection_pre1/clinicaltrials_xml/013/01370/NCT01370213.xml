	<brief_summary>This phase II multi-institutional therapeutic study NK-cell base nonmyeloablative haploidentical transplantation treatment high-risk acute myeloid disease . Enrollment use two-stage design . Stage 1 enroll 15 patient unless early stopping rule meet . If 9 first 15 patient achieve leukemia free neutrophil engraftment day +28 accrual move stage 2 . In stage 2 , additional 28 patient enrol total 43 patient . Patients follow disease response 2 year .</brief_summary>
