	<brief_title>The Effect Chymosin Intestinal Absorption Calcium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Osteoporosis frequent disease . Allegedly , 500,000 Danes diagnose osteoporosis , consequence , seem every year 20,000 fracture . A number factor know increase risk osteoporosis , include low daily intake calcium . Several clinical trial calcium supplement adult ( without simultaneous supplementation vitamin D ) show increase bone mineral density ( Bone Mineral Density , BMD ) reduction risk fracture . Similarly , several study show high milk intake childhood adolescence may increase bone mass reduce risk fracture later life . Since adequate calcium intake important bone turnover risk develop osteoporosis , important explore way well calcium influx . Several study document supplementation calcium tablet often associate poor compliance - people remember take tablet . It therefore desirable find method increase intake amount calcium occur naturally diet . Calcium consume dairy product must first cleave molecule bound absorb . Various method try optimize amount calcium absorb dairy product , include addition call fructo-oligosaccharides ( FOSS ) casein phosphopeptides ( CPPs ) . Chymosin enzyme cleaves protein bind amino acid κ-casein . The reaction occur ingestion milk cause process whereby time milk stay gastrointestinal tract extend , lead enhanced uptake calcium . When body 's calcium balance balance excretion urine ( 24 h ) roughly size intake . Therefore measurement circadian urine excretion calcium determine amount calcium absorb intestine . Purpose hypothesis : Primarily study intend clarify whether addition chymosin milk increase intestinal calcium absorption . Secondary explore issue significance effect , include vitamin D status amount daily calcium intake , whether change calcium absorption immediate effect bone turnover ( measure plasma osteocalcin , plasma bone specific alkaline phosphatase , renal excretion cross-linked N-terminal telopeptide type 1 collagen ( NTx/Cr ) ratio ) parathyroid function ( measure PTH ) . Finally explore relation bone mineral density ( BMD ) measure parameter ( term P-PTH , P-25OHD , P-1,25 ( OH ) 2D , P-osteocalcin , P-BSAP , U-NTx/Cr ) . Design : The study conduct randomize double-blinded control cross-over trial 125 healthy subject ask drink glass milk without added chymosin two occasion . The two time two test day separate 10-18 day . Neither study participant staff conduct investigation ( investigator ) trial conduct know day trial milk contain chymosin ( double-blinded ) . About chymosin add milk first second test day determine lot ( randomize study ) . Study Population : Healthy participant agegroup 25-40 year old recruit . From central personal register ( CPR register ) list young people live Aarhus area drawn , follow send direct letter ask participation study . At time questionnaire clarify whether participation possible , i.e . whether criterion participation survey meet .</detailed_description>
