	<brief_summary>Falls consequence among major problem medical care older individual . The long-term goal research establish efficacy scientifically ground mechanism-based therapeutic intervention improve balance function prevent fall old people . When human balance challenge , protective stepping vital strategy prevent fall activity daily life . Many old people risk fall particular difficulty successfully step sideways protective response loss balance lateral direction . We propose age-related decline lateral balance function impair protective stepping precipitate fall , result neuromechanical ( NM ) limitation hip abductor-adductor ( AB-AD ) muscle strength ( torque power ) . Moreover , hypothesize functional NM impairment reversible combined high intensity induce step training ( IST ) muscle strengthen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Falls consequence among major problem medical care older individual . Some 30 percent community dwell people age 65 year old , 50 percent living institution fall year . Among old adult , complication fall lead cause death due injury common cause nonfatal injury hospitalization trauma . The total lifetime healthcare cost fall-related injury elderly project reach $ 85 billion year 2020 . Even absence injury due fall , tendency lose balance among elderly commonly result overall reduction level physical activity , decrease ability satisfactorily function social role . Despite contribution multiple risk factor age-related fall ( e.g. , environmental hazard , orthostatic hypotension , disorientation , sedation ) , well recognize fall present great impairment neuromechanical ( NM ) factor old non-fallers . Aging change balance gait associate NM impairment also consistently find among important risk factor fall . What presently unresolved , however , among age-associated NM impairment , alter balance mobility function best associate fall responsive intervention ( train ) .</detailed_description>
