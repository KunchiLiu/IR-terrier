	<brief_summary>The purpose study create institutional population-based registry Hyponatremia prospective survey base epidemiological data , risk factor , diagnosis , prognosis , treatment , monitor survival . This study also describe occurrence hyponatremia population HIBA Central Hospital , well characteristic clinical presentation , evolution predispose factor hyponatremia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alterations plasma sodium concentration ( sodium ratio solvent ) common clinical practice . Since plasma sodium concentration major determinant plasma osmolality , determine balance different body fluids compartment . Hyponatremia define measurement plasma sodium 136 mmol per liter . Hyponatremia may associate normal tone , low high . The pseudohyponatremia artifact measure concentration sodium context growth concentration active osmoles ( glucose , mannitol ) , induce water movement intracellular extracellular . This also occur context substance generate osmolarity triglyceride plasma protein . In first case , investigator presence hypertonic hyponatremia , second case isotonic hyponatremia , neither consider true hyponatremia . The hypotonic hyponatremia one consider true . It represent common electrolyte imbalance hospitalize patient ( 2 % 22 % depend series cutoff point ) outpatient ( 7 % 18 % tertiary care center , dependent variable cutoff series ) . It associate increased morbidity mortality ( 18 % hospitalized patient ) . It cause serious illness require immediate attention marker morbidity mortality underlie disease ( congestive heart failure , liver cirrhosis ) . Hyponatremia occur wide range patient , asymptomatic good tolerance critically ill . Symptoms may mild severe , none specific . They mainly neurological generally reflect dysfunction associate cerebral edema . They cause due magnitude alteration plasma sodium concentration system speed . The clinical management challenge identification specific treatment cause , understand study brings knowledge pathophysiology . The latter grouped loss sodium / gain fluid . In turn , gain liquid possible alteration kidney dilusorios mechanism , well variation accord glomerular filtration rate filter sodium load . Its high prevalence potential neurologic sequela associate disease treatment make diagnosis appropriate treatment mandatory . Traditionally , initial assessment treatment suboptimal descriptive series . We find literature systematic record patient abnormalities sodium concentration inpatient outpatient , except record pharmacological effect . We believe highly prevalent disorder , attractive pharmaceutical industry would partly explain apparent lack study large group patient . We also find descriptive study conduct Argentina . While multiple proposal evaluation alteration sodium , standardization single cleavage specific sodium , appropriate diagnostic evaluation propose best treatment hyponatremia . There technical difficulty standardization assessment symptom , physical examination , effectiveness clinical parameter guide therapy . There report strategy use country diagnosis decision make patient alteration plasma sodium concentration . Nor Disnatremias epidemiological data environment , risk factor , assessment monitoring survival , complication recurrence . We reference literature talk behaviour disnatremias area inpatient outpatient , data see whether treatment aim mere correction hyponatremia , interpretation pathophysiological . The systematic recording case Disnatremias reveal characteristic disease environment , diagnostic strategy use result time course disease . We believe knowledge allow u design study optimize standardize diagnostic strategy , evaluation treatment , result benefit affected population .</detailed_description>
