	<brief_title>Comparison Cervical Laminectomy Laminoplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically , cervical laminectomy proven effective treatment symptomatic patient cervical myelopathy . This standard procedure employ accomplish posterior decompression cervical spinal cord patient multi-level cervical spinal stenosis normal near normal cervical spinal curvature alignment without associate instability . Laminoplasty develop Japan alternative laminectomy procedure intent reduce post-operative morbidity dorsal cervical spinal cord decompression , neck pain maintain relative stability cervical spine multi-level decompression . The goal laminoplasty laminectomy procedure provide spinal cord decompression enlargement spinal canal . A potential benefit laminoplasty compare laminectomy preserve stability range motion cervical spine without complete disruption/removal posterior lamina , spinous process interspinous ligamentous structure . Various author describe different laminoplasty technique ; preserve lamina expand size spinal canal fix free partially free lamina posterior position . The primary study hypothesis , patient treat laminoplasty ARCH fixation ( Treatment Group ) clinical radiographic outcome assess valid outcome measure , inferior patient treat laminectomy ( Control Group )</detailed_description>
