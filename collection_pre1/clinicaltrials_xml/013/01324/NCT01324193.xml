	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient low physical function high rate cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) mortality . The objective propose research evaluate effect dietary supplementation pomegranate extract , contain high amount antioxidant , physical function CVD risk . Patients moderate severe chronic kidney disease NOT yet dialysis tend significantly reduce risk factor cardiovascular disease ( disorder ) compare dialysis patient . This include significantly reduce systemic marker oxidative stress inflammation . As result , therapy design reduce risk CKD co-morbidities may differ significantly dialysis pre-dialysis patient . For example , dialysis patient recommend INCREASE intake dietary protein , pre-dialysis patient recommend DECREASE protein intake , due difference pathophysiology two condition . The investigator decide recruit pre-dialysis patient addition dialysis patient study investigator believe help u determine efficacy pomegranate differs patient different stage CKD . CKD patient recruit 2 phase : CKD patient receive dialysis treatment ( pre-dialysis patient ) recruit first phase . This include patient CKD stage 3-5 yet dialysis . In second phase , CKD patient dialysis treatment recruit . To address question , CKD patient randomize follow group 12 month : 1 ) POM supplementation/control ( CON ) , 2 ) oral supplementation purify pomegranate extract ( POM ) . Patients POM group ingest 1000 milligram capsule POM extract , 7 day per week . Patients CON group receive placebo capsule use protocol . On three occasion , baseline , 6 , 12 month , subject blood collect measure plasma marker oxidative stress ( TBARS , lipid peroxide ) , blood lipid level , glucose insulin level . Arterial cardiac structure function measure vascular ultrasound echocardiogram , respectively . A 24-hour dietary recall use assess intake nutrient . Leg strength measure resistance exercise machine . Bone density body composition evaluate use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . Pre-dialysis subject undergo maximal exercise test ass cardiorespiratory fitness level . In dialysis patient , instead maximal exercise test , physical function measure 6-item functional fitness assessment 10-meter walk test .</detailed_description>
