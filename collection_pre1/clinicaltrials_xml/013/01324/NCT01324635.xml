	<brief_title>Panobinostat Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain tumor , primary metastatic present therapeutic challenge . Radiation therapy play major role management entity . Nonetheless , local control remain sub-optimal large proportion patient . Over previous decade great deal progress regard 1 ) precision localization target brain lesion radiation , 2 ) increase use single/hypofractionation schedule 3 ) combining fractionate conformal radiation target agent . This trial utilize novel approach - combination HDAC inhibitor ( Panobinostat ) stereotactic radiosurgery . The combination blend advantage extreme high precision radiation potent target agent - promising enhance efficacy minimal toxicity . The investigator examine combination three setting , current standard care sub-optimal : 1 . Recurrent glioma 2 . High grade meningioma 3 . Large brain metastasis solid malignancy Histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) inhibitor , include Panobinostat , radiosensitize tumor cell vitro vivo . HDAC inhibitor modify expression approximately 8 % transcriptome83 . In particular , show regulate expression DNA repair enzyme rad51 , possibly explain radiosensitization property . It think Panobinostat radiosensitizes epigenetic mechanism . Since target HDAC inhibitor include many protein beyond histone , many prefer name `` deacetylase inhibitor '' , ( DAC ) . There several line evidence suggest HDAC inhibitor cross BBB . The anticonvulsant valproic acid , member short chain fatty acid class HDAC inhibitor , well-recognized capacity cross BBB . HDAC inhibitor also study Huntington 's disease . Panobinostat able cross blood-brain-barrier influence gene expression rodent . When combine radiation therapy systemic agent generally consider important high concentration drug present , , time irradiation . The goal use panobinostat radiosensitizer , single systemic agent . The investigator administer oral panobinostat 3 time weekly 2 week . This open label phase I clinical trial two arm , represent single fractionate radiation therapy ( Figure 4.1 ) . Within arm radiation dose pre-determined escalated . Panobinostat administer orally 3 time week 2 week . Panobinostat dose-escalated independently arm . There intra-patient dose escalation . Recurrent glioma ( Arm A ) treat accord Jefferson protocol re-irradiation , 10 fraction 3.5Gy deliver 2 week . Panobinostat administer orally three time week 2 week , start day 1st fraction radiation . High-grade meningioma ( Arm A ) treat 6 weeks/30 fraction fractionate radiation therapy , total dose 54 Gy 60 Gy fraction either 1.8Gy 2Gy . Panobinostat administer orally three time week 2 week , start day 1st fraction radiation . Large brain metastasis ( Arm B ) treat single fraction radiosurgery . Panobinostat administer orally three time week 2 week , start day radiation . The radiosurgery may deliver either LINAC , gamma-knife , cyber-knife tomotherapy technology . Radiation treatment : definition target volume : Recurrent glioma ( Arm A ) If progression diagnose development new enhance tumor : The gross tumor volume ( GTV ) define new contrast-enhanced T1 abnormality post-operative MRI scan . This generally include surgical cavity margin recent surgical procedure . If progression diagnose development new non-enhancing tumor : volume define careful comparison new previous MRI scan consultation neuro-radiologist . This generally include surgical cavity margin recent surgical procedure . The GTV expand additional margin 5.0 mm create PTV . This 5mm margin may reduce , eliminate around natural barrier tumor growth skull , ventricle , falx , etc , also allow spar optic nerve/chiasm critical structure discretion treat physician . The minimum dose PTV 95 % prescription dose ( 35Gy ) . The maximum dose PTV 110 % . Any beam arrangement set energy accomplishes criterion allow . High-grade meningioma ( Arm A ) Target volume base upon postoperative-enhanced MRI ( unless biopsy perform ) . Preoperative imaging may use correlation improve identification . The gross tumor volume ( GTV ) define tumor bed postoperative- enhanced MRI include residual nodular enhancement . Cerebral edema specifically include within GTV . The `` dural tail '' may may-not include depend physician preference . The clinical target volume ( CTV ) GTV plus margin 1.0 cm 2.0cm accord physician preference . The CTV margin may reduce 0.5 cm around natural barrier tumor growth skull . The planning target volume ( PTV ) additional margin 3.0 5.0 mm , depend upon localization method reproducibility . PTV margin account variation set-up reproducibility . The CTV/PTV margin way modify allow spar optic nerve/chiasm critical structure discretion treat physician . The minimum dose PTV 95 % prescription dose ( 35Gy ) . The maximum dose PTV 110 % . Any beam arrangement set energy accomplishes criterion allow . Large brain metastasis ( Arm B ) Single fraction radiosurgery dose accordance prescription RTOG radiosurgery trial 90-058 . Metastases large 2 cm equal small 3 cm treat 18•0 Gy ; metastasis large 3 cm less equal 4 cm treat prescription dose 15.0 Gy . Radiation therapy plan accordance standard radio-surgical principal , i.e . prescribe 50 % isodose line gamma-knife 90 % isosurface LINAC base system . 6.3 Technical aspect radiation therapy Fractionated treatment highly conformal external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) deliver either gamma-knife , tomotherapy , cyberknife megavoltage LINAC radiation therapy machine energy ≥ 6 MV . Any standard technique dose plan include conformal dynamic arc , 3D-CRT IMRT may use . For single fraction treatment cyber-knife , LINAC , tomotherapy gamma-knife base radiosurgery may use . Normal tissue constraint Arm A , Recurrent glioma The brain stem : 1cm3 receive 30Gy ; optic chiasm optic nerve receive 25Gy , unless include target volume . Arm A , High-grade meningioma Lenses 7Gy , Retinae 50Gy , Optic Nerves 55Gy , Optic Chiasm 56Gy , Brainstem 60Gy Arm B , Single fraction Brain stem 1cm3 receive 10Gy ; optic chiasm optic nerve 8 Gy ; In event organ risk ( OAR ) immediate proximity PTV dose OAR constrain within protocol limit , final decision leave treat physician weigh potential treatment toxicity versus under-coverage target volume . Panobinostat oral administration provide Novartis . Medication label comply US legal requirement print English . They supply information patient . The storage condition study drug describe medication label , investigator 's brochure , edition # 5 19-Jun-2009 . Panobinostat administrate least 2-hour fast , subject continue fast 2 hour . If patient miss one dose panobinostat next dose panobinostat due , patient take make dose early time , resume protocol schedule . If patient miss one dose panobinostat , patient due next dose panobinostat , patient resume protocol schedule without make miss dose/doses . If patient miss one panobinostat dose past schedule last dosing time panobinostat , patient stop panobinostat without make miss dose/doses .</detailed_description>
