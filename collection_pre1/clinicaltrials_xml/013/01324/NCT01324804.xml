	<brief_summary>The negative effect internal mammary harvest sternal perfusion well know , especially diabetic subject . Microdialysis previously show increased lactate tissue concentration mammary artery preparation . Although high antibiotic concentration utmost importance region , study previously measure effect internal mammary artery harvest target tissue antibiotic concentration . Study hypothesis : Internal mammary artery harvesting impose additional risk deep sternal wound infection impair antibiotic tissue penetration . This effect mediate altered perfusion pattern may see cephalosporin and/or Teicoplanin treatment . Study objective : To evaluate impact leave internal mammary artery preparation target tissue antibiotic concentration Cefazolin Teicoplanin cardiac surgery Design : This study design observational pharmacokinetic trial . Patients control measure antibiotic concentration different subcutaneous tissue . Study population : Patients refer coronary artery bypass graft Department Cardiothoracic Surgery plan unilateral leave internal mammary artery preparation high risk profile deep sternal wound infection ask participate trial .</brief_summary>
