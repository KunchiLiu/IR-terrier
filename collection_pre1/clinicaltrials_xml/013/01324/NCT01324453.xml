	<brief_summary>This study evaluate change heart muscle function baseline three month twelve month participant present heart attack completely occlude coronary artery . These subject randomize receive standard Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) /Stenting open artery routine PTCA/Stenting plus post conditioning . Post conditioning commences immediately upon reperfusion use four cycle thirty second inflation standard angioplasty balloon follow thirty second reperfusion . The investigator hypothesize Postconditioning reduces size heart attack utilized successful primary Angioplasty/stent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Clinical Trial Evaluate Benefits Postconditioning ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single center study involve 140 patient randomize Post Conditioning + Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) versus routine PCI ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI , Heart Attack ) presentation . The Post Conditioning protocol consist perform four , 30-second PTCA ( Angioplasty ) balloon occlusion follow 30-seconds reperfusion total 4 minute . The first balloon inflation occur immediately angioplasty guidewire place obstruction artery . Following protocol vessel stented part usual practice treatment STEMI . No treatment difference occur two group patient receive usual post-STEMI care . Patients group receive cardiac MRI 3-5 day follow STEMI measurement heart attack size heart muscle function , among measure . Patients undergo collection blood CK MB troponin I every 8 hour 24 hour follow PCI . All patient follow phone follow-up visit review history MACE ( death , recurrent STEMI , repeat revascularization , arrhythmia , ICD placement hospitalization CHF ) . All patient require take P2Y12 inhibitor aspirin duration trial . All patient treat ACEI , beta blocker statin .</detailed_description>
