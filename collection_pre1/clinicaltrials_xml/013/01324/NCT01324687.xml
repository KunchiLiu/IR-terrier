	<brief_summary>The system medical care older adult acute illness often serve poorly . Many factor limit patient ' access safe , patient-centered , efficient , high-quality , acute care . These factor include shortage geriatrician primary care physician ; limited availability timely , acute-illness , patient appointment ; emergency department ( ED ) crowding ; interruption continuity care patient use ED ; poor transition care ambulatory set ED . These condition foster unnecessary ED use , adverse event ED old adult particularly at-risk , unnecessary medical cost . As population age , magnitude problem increase . The overarch study goal develop evaluate telemedicine-enhanced care model improve access safe , high-quality , acute illness care older adult ; foster appropriate use health service ; reduces unnecessary expenditure . Specifically , study aim : 1 . Expand exist pediatric HeA telemedicine network old adult provide senior living community ( SLC ) alternative on-site care option individual acute illness episode . Hypothesis 1 : 90 % request telemedicine visit successfully complete . 2 . Evaluate impact HeA telemedicine model utilization , quality care , patient safety . Hypothesis 2 : The rate ED use low SLCs access care via telemedicine , compare SLCs without access care . Hypothesis 3 : Quality care patient safety measure well SLC resident access telemedicine-enhanced care resident without form access . 3 . Evaluate economic benefit care deliver telemedicine network . Hypothesis 4 : The net cost healthcare per patient-month le SLC resident access telemedicine-enhanced care without form access . 4 . Use qualitative method identify strategy asset promote condition impede implementation , acceptance , success HeA telemedicine network SLCs . This knowledge inform effort develop toolkit use disseminate technology broadly .</brief_summary>
