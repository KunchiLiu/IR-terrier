	<brief_title>Web-Based Weight Management Individuals With Mental Illness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background/Rationale : Obesity physical inactivity reach epidemic proportion , result increase rate chronic disease , premature death , substantial health care cost . Excess weight even prevalent population serious mental illness ( SMI ) , part due medication-induced weight gain social disadvantage . Since individual SMI often cognitive deficit , specialized approach require help people manage weight . Researchers find specialize in-person intervention focus diet activity help individual SMI manage weight . However , evidence-based practice widely disseminate . Barriers use intervention include reluctance individual participate group , difficulty find transportation frequent visit clinic , shortage train clinician , inadequate clinician time provide intervention . It likely barrier address web-based weight intervention tailor individual SMI . Specialized web-based approach study find effective population , deliver content intensive engage minimal requirement clinician time . Objectives : The investigator proposal previously develop prototype web-based system provide limited diet education individual SMI . The current project extend evaluate system . The project 's objective : 1 ) build prototype develop `` eWellness , '' comprehensive web-based system delivers evidence-based weight management program focus diet activity , meet need individual SMI ; 2 ) evaluate effectiveness , individual SMI , eWellness program compare control group ; , 3 ) characterize , perspective individual SMI , strength , weakness , barrier use eWellness . Methods : This randomize , control trial individual SMI community mental health center overweight prescribed medication weight gain common side-effect . Participants assign eWellness program continue usual care . Research assessments occur baseline , 3 , 6 month . Changes outcomes compare time two group . Significance : By lose weight , individual mental illness decrease risk medical problem , improve quality life life expectancy . A web-based system help individual lose weight could feasible disseminate broadly medical center , clinic , community base program rural urban area .</detailed_description>
