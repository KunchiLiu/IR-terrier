	<brief_title>Insulin Pump Therapy Continuous Glucose Monitoring Diabetic Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis ( CAPD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic nephropathy account 20 % 40 % patient enter end-stage renal failure ( ESRF ) program . The quality glycemic control know important determinant rate progression patient diabetic continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( CAPD ) patient . Diabetic CAPD patient usually treat dialysis fluid utilize glucose osmotic agent provide ultrafiltration . Most diabetic CAPD patient HbA1c read 7 % despite recommendation keep read 7 % . The continuous blood glucose monitor ( CGMS ) recently offer opportunity monitor blood glucose 5-minute interval 72 continuous hour diabetic patient . The CGMS pattern reveal blood glucose tracing well recommended standard control diabetic CAPD patient . Good glycemic control often difficult maintain diabetic patient treat CAPD continuously expose high concentration glucose peritoneal dialysate . However , recent study suggest diabetic patient use insulin pump show reduce glycated hemoglobin level without increase risk hypoglycemia , compare regimen multiple daily insulin injection , result diabetic CAPD patient report .</detailed_description>
