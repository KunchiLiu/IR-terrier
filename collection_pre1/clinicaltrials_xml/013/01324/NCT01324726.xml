	<brief_summary>There great increase incidence infection cause bacteria resistant antibiotic agent . Many infection result bad outcomes patient increase cost healthcare system . The study aim survey two germ resistant wide range antibiotic use today . The investigator particularly interested study potential stop spread prevent outbreak germ contact isolation patient affect germ . Patients include study antibiotic resistant infection cause 2 bacteria : E. coli K. pneumoniae . The research team perform rectal , skin ( armpit , groin , umbilicus ) , throat , urine , , applicable , wound culture determine site germ may present cause infection . The study coordinator furthermore examine patient 's medical record conduct short interview order evaluate specific information bacteria recover . This research involve intervention beyond collection specimens added risk patient conduction study . Neither benefit patient level . The benefit level patient population , i.e . large scale information collect analyzed . Only principal investigator study coordinator access patient-specific information . Once information collect , patient identifier , name medical record number , delete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Colonization With Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamase ( ESBL ) -Producing Organisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rise incidence infection cause extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) produce Enterobacteriaceae worldwide dimension , particularly develop country . At American University Beirut Medical Center ( AUB-MC ) , proportion ESBL produce E. coli ( ESBL-EC ) K. pneumoniae ( ESBL-KP ) strain risen 2.5 % 9.8 % 22 % 27 % , respectively 1999 2008 . The rapid spread multi drug resistant pathogen prompt study factor aim limit ongoing transmission organism . Infection control intervention , contact isolation infect patient , use control outbreaks infection cause ESBL produce organisms setting pathogen isolate rectal axillary sample , well upper respiratory tract secretion . These report raise concern colonization infect patient site primary site infection . Colonization absence outbreak far look systematically , especially high-endemicity area Lebanon . The present study ultimately aim assess usefulness place patient ESBL-EC ESBL-KP infection contact isolation hospital stay , whether practice would limit spread infection . This prospective study screen hospitalized patient ESBL-EC ESBL-KP infection colonization organism sit primary site infection culture rectum , skin , nasopharynx , urine , applicable , wound . Cases identify Clinical Microbiology Laboratory AUBMC study subject enrol accord inclusion/exclusion criterion . In addition culture multiple body site , molecular analysis perform isolated ESBL-producing strain identify clonal relatedness . Cultures repeat monthly period 6 month . The sample size estimate 100 patient two year period . The result study implication infection control practice constitute prerequisite study future . The objective proposal evaluate extent colonization ESBL-EC ESBL-KP hospitalize patient active infection design recommendation accordingly . The specific aim include : 1 . Identify hospitalized patient infection due ESBL-producing organism primary site 2 . Screen patient colonization ESBL-producing organism body site primary site infection culture : - Rectum - Skin ( axilla , groin , umbilicus ) - Nasopharynx - Urine - Wound ( applicable ) 3 . Perform susceptibility test collect isolates detect ESBL-EC ESBL-KP 4 . Perform molecular test ESBL-producing pathogen isolate site colonization compare organism recover primary site order identify clonal relatedness 5 . Perform follow culture mention site treatment primary infection complete determine duration colonization 6 . Draw conclusion regard extent colonization ESBL-producing organism hospitalize patient primary infection evaluate infection control implication ( particularly respect place patient isolation precaution )</detailed_description>
