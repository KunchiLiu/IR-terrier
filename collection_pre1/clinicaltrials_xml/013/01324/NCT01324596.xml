	<brief_summary>The aim study : - To evaluate benefit addition bortezomib standard rituximab cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisolone ( R-CHOP ) therapy Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . - To determine whether molecular phenotype effect benefit derive addition bortezomib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomised Evaluation Molecular Guided Therapy Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma With Bortezomib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>REMoDLB trial aim determine whether addition bortezomib ( drug block action cellular complex break protein ) standard combination chemotherapy ( call R-CHOP ) improve long patient diffuse large B cell lymphoma survive without recurrence disease . Results recent research suggest patient divide two biologically distinct subgroup label GCB ( germinal centre derive B-cells like ) ABC ( activated peripheral B-cells like ) . GCB patient tend well standard combination chemotherapy , ABC patient majority treatment failure . It think ABC patient benefit addition bortezomib . The trial discuss patient . They ask consent molecular profile tumour block whilst time consider whether wish enter main trial . This allow time sample analyse particular biological subgroup determine . All patient consent enter main study give initial cycle RCHOP chemotherapy . Within subgroup ( ABC GCB ) patient randomly assign receive either RCHOP RCHOP bortezomib ensure number biological subgroup receive two treatment . All patient 5 cycle assign treatment regimen ( either RCHOP RCHOP bortezomib ) . All patient follow period five year complete chemotherapy . The GCB group receive RCHOP bortezomib regularly check see new treatment improve survival without recurrence disease . If addition bortezomib find beneficial group patient part trial stop GCB patient receive standard treatment ( RCHOP ) . It anticipate 560 892 patient randomly allocate two treatment , exact number depend whether GCB group receive RCHOP bortezomib stop .</detailed_description>
