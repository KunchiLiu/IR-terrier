	<brief_summary>The incidence Non alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) continue increase , prevalence estimate NAFLD range 17-33 % , make common cause chronic liver disease North America . It associate increase cardiovascular morbidity well progression cirrhosis subset patient . There currently approve treatment NAFLD . A key barrier development effective therapy lack consensus criterion diagnosis endpoint study evaluate diagnostic marker , prognosis therapeutic modality . NAFLD encompass entire pathological spectrum disease , relatively benign accumulation lipid ( steatosis ) progressive non alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) associate inflammation , fibrosis , necrosis . It estimate 20-30 % patient NAFLD exhibit biochemical histological change characteristic NASH , 15-20 % patient progress cirrhosis . NASH remain important phenotypic state , sub-group patient deem high-risk develop progressive disease result cirrhosis , liver failure require transplantation , death . Although NAFLD date include component metabolic syndrome , increase evidence NAFLD frequently accompany development insulin resistance therefore may indicator predictor future cardiometabolic risk . Moreover , recent finding skeletal muscle experimental insulin resistance ( lipid infusion ) well naturally occur obese type 2 diabetic , insulin resistant patient show skeletal muscle inflammation lead pattern extracellular matrix , structural , remodel abnormality closely resemble TGFb , connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) mediate fibrotic response differentiate simple steatotic liver NASH . This suggest may common underlie mechanism . Given ready availability skeletal muscle tissue use percutaneous needle muscle biopsy , compare invasive liver biopsy , may possible use characteristic skeletal muscle distinguish severity liver fibrosis . Given preponderance patient identify NAFLD , recognition le non invasive test help discriminate different phenotypic type NAFLD would highly practical useful . This would help identify patient risk progression cirrhosis , thus make target available therapeutic intervention . The investigator hypothesize 1 . Insulin resistance measure glucose tolerance test directly correlate extent liver muscle fibrosis , 2 . Inflammation fibrosis skeletal muscle correlate histopathological change see patient NAFLD , potentially skeletal muscle inflammation may use diagnostic predictor differentiate patient NASH patient simple steatosis . The overall goal project determine extent inflammation fibrosis skeletal muscle mirror predictive level liver inflammation distinguish NASH simple steatosis . Specifically , investigator propose follow Aims : 1 . To use estimate insulin sensitivity model oral glucose tolerance test test hypothesis extent liver muscle fibrosis directly relate insulin resistance . 2 . To use liver muscle biopsy characterize change abundance mRNAs protein characterize inflammation , extracellular matrix remodeling , fibrosis . The investigator use quantitative rt-PCR immunoblot analysis compare mRNA expression protein abundance collagen I III , fibronectin , connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) test hypothesis direct relationship level proteins muscle liver degree fibrosis . 3 . To establish biospecimen repository serum , mRNA circulate white blood cell , liver muscle tissue , DNA serve substrate future study pathogenesis NASH .</brief_summary>
