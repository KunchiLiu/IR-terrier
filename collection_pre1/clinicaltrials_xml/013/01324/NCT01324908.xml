	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study biomarkers predict response patient graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) undergo extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) . ECP treat patient 's blood ultraviolet light outside body kill white blood cell return blood back patient 's body . Studying sample blood patient GVHD may help doctor identify learn biomarkers related GVHD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To show extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) increase skin gut home T regulatory ( T-reg ) cell patient GVHD clinically respond ECP . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Response rate GVHD extracorporeal photopheresis ( ECP ) measure NIH response criterion II . Incidence T-reg cell frequency ( % ) various NIH subtypes chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) III . Incidence T-reg home subset ( % ) various NIH subtypes chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) OUTLINE : Patients undergo ECP twice week 4 week twice week every 2 week 8 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 , 4 , 6 month .</detailed_description>
