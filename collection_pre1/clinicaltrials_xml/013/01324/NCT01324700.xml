	<brief_summary>Asthma common increase prevalence mortality especially low-income minority population . The course asthma appear influenced mood emotion . It report high prevalence depression depressive symptom child adult asthma . Despite data frequency depression asthma adverse consequence , generally recognize treat . Brown et al . conduct randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial citalopram 90 outpatient asthma MDD . Citalopram therapy associate low depression score , numerically great rate remission depressive symptom , less oral corticosteroid use placebo . The investigator propose study different . The investigator observe modest difference antidepressant placebo prior trial . However , subgroup severe asthma ( base frequent corticosteroid use ) severe depression ( base higher depressive symptom score ) investigator saw much large effect size . Standard care severe asthma aggressive asthma treatment . The investigator study require change patient 's asthma treatment . No guideline currently available treatment depression asthma patient . Standard care depression would antidepressant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A 12-week , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled acute phase trial escitalopram propose 222 person asthma Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . This sample consist 80 stratified High severity group consist baseline score &gt; = 20 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD ) &gt; = 3 course oral corticosteroid past 12 month . A separate group stratify Low severity group 142 MDD asthma HRSD-17 score &lt; 20 &lt; 3 course oral corticosteroid past 12 month . A 16 week continuation phase also propose depression responder week 12 . The participant recruit Parkland Hospital Health System ( PHHS ) Asthma Allergy Clinics Aston Clinic use Self-Report Screening Tool Depression ( 2-SRSD ) , brief depression questionnaire , part routine clinical practice . Potential participant give appointment schedule PI 's office complete baseline assessment time write informed consent obtain study-specific assessment complete . At baseline appointment , RA administer Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) baseline establish current diagnosis MDD . Participants meet inclusion criterion administer IDS-SR30 , SF-36 , Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ ) , Mini Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( Mini AQLQ ) , Cumulative Illness Rating Scale ( CIRS ) , PRD-III Somatic Symptom Scale ( PRD-III ) side effect , blood draw routine laboratory analysis , force expiratory volume 1-second percentage normal ( FEV1 % ) assess use portable spirometer . Self-reported asthma-related emergency room visit hospitalization quantify past 12 month . Participants receive clinical psychiatric evaluation one investigator confirm diagnosis participant meet entry criterion . Steroid inhaler dose monitor use counter already include manufacturer begin time . After participant determine qualify , steroid inhaler counter use assess baseline adherence . Participants randomize receive either escitalopram placebo identical appearance . Each participant give 14-day supply active medication ( escitalopram 10 mg ) placebo ask return follow-up appointment two week . Each participant give phone number reach Principle Investigator ( PI ) Research Assistant ( RA ) 24 hour day . The RA obtain write consent inform physician treat asthma participation study . Each participant return follow-up appointment twice per month time repeat outcome measure accord schedule give . Pill count conduct , MEMS cap analyzed list current medication dos obtain visit . Participants compensate receive bus pass appointment , plus monetary incentive bring Advair inhaler MEMS cap appointment ( adherence monitoring ) . Participants evaluate RA PI follow-up appointment . Participants show evidence adequate response ( &lt; 30 % decrease HRSD ) antidepressant week 4 , side effect , dose increase two tablet ( 20 mg active medication placebo ) . At week 12 , responder ( HRSD reduction ≥50 % baseline ) continue blind treatment assessment every 4 week additional 16 week ( continuation phase ) . Nonresponders remove study give standard treatment unblinded psychiatrist ( Dr. Nakamura ) referral make treatment . Continuation phase begin final week 12 assessment responder . They give 4-week supply medication dose take week 12 , instruction call experience worsening symptom ( e.g. , decrease sleep , suicidal thought ) 4-week appointment , appointment study physician arrange . The HRSD assess interim appointment participant discontinue meet discontinuation criterion . Treatment referral arrange acute phase study . At completion 28 week , refer treatment appropriate , PCP , Parkland Psychiatry Clinic , private psychiatrist , UT Southwestern Medical Center , county Mental Health Mental Retardation ( MHMR ) system . Parking/bus tokens provide . A final visit safety , assess follow-up adherence collect asthma depression outcome data arrange 4 week last appointment ( e.g. , discontinuation end acute phase , end continuation phase , discontinue early reason ) . The assessment schedule design approximate good clinical practice depression , thus , may somewhat less intensive antidepressant trial . The following assessment instrument use investigation . A two-item , self-report screen tool depression ( 2-SRSD ) take Primary Care Evaluation Mental Disorders Procedure ( PRIME-MD ) screen interview use detect suspect case depression among asthma clinic patient . The specificity 2-SRSD population 57 % . Thus , expect identify almost true positive , substantial number false positive . A positive answer either 1 ) `` During past month , often bother feeling , depress , hopeless ? '' 2 ) `` During past month , often bother little interest pleasure thing ? '' consider possible case depression qualify assessment . MDD define least five nine symptom must include depressed mood loss interest also include psychomotor change , appetite change weight loss , sleep change , decrease concentration , guilt , decrease energy level ( lassitude ) , suicidal ideation . The symptom must occur time last least 2 week associate change functioning . The symptom must direct physiologic effect drug medical illness ( e.g. , hypothyroidism ) bereavement . MDD diagnose use structured clinical interview address symptom use information patient , family , physician , medical record establish diagnosis . The clinician version structure Clinical Interview DSM-IV ( SCID ) brief structure interview major Axis I disorder DSM-IV include major depressive disorder , dysthymic disorder , bipolar disorder , psychotic disorder , anxiety disorder , eat disorder , alcohol substance abuse/dependence . The Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HRSD , 17-item version ) observer-rated measure depressive symptomatology . The HRSD administer every visit . The Inventory Depressive Symptomatology-Self-report ( IDS-SR30 ) 30-item self-report scale ass depressive symptom severity . The IDS-SR30 administered every visit . The Hamilton Rating Scale Anxiety ( HRSA ) 14-item observer rating scale ass degree pathology associate anxiety anxious mood , tension , fear , insomnia . The HRSA administer every visit . Asthma symptom assess every visit use Asthma Control Questionnaire ( ACQ ) . Pulmonary function also assess every visit spirometry , use equipment meeting standard ATS , calibrate accord manufacturer 's recommendation . Spirometry perform accord ATS guideline , best three acceptable effort . Spirometry measure , 10 minute , two puff albuterol administer via meter dose inhaler . Bronchodilator response calculate [ ( post FEV1 - pre FEV1 ) /pre FEV1 ] , convert percent improvement . The Psychobiology Recovery Depression-III Somatic Symptom Scale ( PRD-III ) 24 item , side effect scale develop longitudinal depression study . The PRD-III cover wide range common medication side effect quickly easily administer clinician . The PRD-III administered every visit . Asthma-related quality life assess Mini-AQLQ , 15 item , self-administered scale measure functional impairment troublesome adult asthma patient . Mini-AQLQ show good responsiveness , reliability , construct validity compare longer 32 item version . Both version Mini-AQLQ correlate well SF 36 mental physical subscales ACQ score ( asthma symptom ) , spirometry beta-agonist use . The Mini-AQLQ administered baseline , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 , exit continue , week 28 . General functioning assess 36-Item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) , self-reported tool use assess physical mental functioning . The scale consist summary measure physical mental health divide scale physical functioning , role-physical , bodily pain , general health , vitality , social functioning , role-emotional , mental health . Scores normative score 50±10 indicate good average functioning score 50 suggest normal functioning . The SF-36 administered baseline , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 , exit continue , week 28 . Medical illness burden assess baseline exit Cumulative Illness Rating Scale ( CIRS ) , valid widely use 13-item , 0-4 , clinician-rated scale assess medical impairment relate major organ system . Medical history review system use rating . The scale rat study physician . The scale use recent antidepressant trial assess medical illness burden . The Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS-10 ) 10-item , 0-4 self-report scale ass stressful feeling thought past month . The PSS-10 adequate reliability validity well predictor outcome ( e.g . depressive physical symptom , utilization health service , social anxiety ) life-event score . The PSS-10 appear provide general appraisal life stress . The PSS-10 administered baseline , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 , exit continue , week 28 .</detailed_description>
