	<brief_title>NG-Nitro-L-Arginine Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine differential effect NG-nitro-L-arginine ( L-NNA ) tumor normal tissue vasculature ( blood flow/volume ) patient advance solid tumor order propose safe recommend dose range evaluation . Secondary - To determine correlation plasma concentration L-NNA toxicity vascular effect . - To determine effect nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) inhibition tumor tissue vasculature . - To determine pharmacokinetics L-NNA . - To determine safety profile L-NNA . Tertiary - To evaluate potential pharmacodynamic effect NOS inhibition angiogenesis . - To evaluate effect L-NNA circulating NOS level . - To evaluate correlation expression level iNOS eNOS vasoconstrictive effect L-NNA tumor tissue ( available ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive single dose NG-nitro-L-arginine ( L-NNA ) IV 10 minute day 1 . All patient undergo 6 dynamic contrast-enhanced compute tomography ( DCE-CT ) . Patients enrol expanded cohort study undergo 4 additional scan dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) well DCE-CT scan . Blood sample collect periodically pharmacokinetic biomarker study . Samples analyze L-NNA level via reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography , NOS inhibition via cGMP analysis , VEGF-A osteopontin level . Previously collect biopsy sample analyze iNOS eNOS expression . After completion study treatment one week assessment , patient follow week 28 day monthly thereafter ( require ) .
