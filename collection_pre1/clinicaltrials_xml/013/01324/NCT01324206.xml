	<brief_summary>Background : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study provide important information structure function various body system , include brain , muscle , joint , heart , blood vessel . Scientific application MRI scan often use technique need modify refine used clinical study . To develop modify technique new Philips 3T Achieva whole-body MRI scanner , researcher interest conduct trial MRI scan healthy individual individual condition require image study . Objectives : - To conduct preliminary trial 3T MRI facility develop refine MRI scanning procedure . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age able magnetic resonance imaging . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , well blood urine test . - Participants MRI scan use 3T scanner . Some scan may require use contrast agent radiotracer , small amount radioactive substance inject start scan . Some participant may ask perform task think movement scanner , order test procedure require functional MRI scan . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study yield important information structure function various body system include brain , muscle , joint , heart , blood vessel body area . Unlike clinical MRI imaging , scientific application often utilize technique either require de-novo development modification exist research commercially available protocol implementation clinical study . The propose protocol intend allow MRI scan human subject development refinement MRI scanning procedure implementation large scale clinical National Institute Aging ( NIA ) research study . We evaluate variety MRI pulse sequence normal volunteer individual variety medical condition determine optimal protocol use normal volunteer patient population . In addition , participant recruit scanned provide additional data already approve NIA study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 18 old . Control subject person identify investigator condition interest exploratory study relate patient illness feature relevant future NIA study Capable provide informed consent EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any condition nonremovable device contraindicate MRI , assess attach safety questionnaire . Weight great specify limit scanner bed Pregnancy GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m ( 2 ) , receive IV contrast Participants schedule MRI contrast eligible MRI Investigator believe enrollment best medical interest . Participants request complete exercise protocol eligible exercise MRI meet eligibility criterion particular exercise protocol . Examples include joint replacement may affect defined exercise protocol may prevent MRI analysis condition , opinion investigator , would prevent successful completion exercise protocol , limited report osteoarthritis , rheumatoid arthritis and/or fibromyalgia .</criteria>
