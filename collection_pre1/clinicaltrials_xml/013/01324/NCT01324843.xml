	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers investigate use DNA vaccine treat various type cancer provoke immune system response tumor cell . DNA vaccine mimic effect normal vaccine give prevent infectious disease , less effective anticipated human . To improve effectiveness DNA vaccine , researcher study alternate delivery method , investigational Derma Vax ( Trademark ) injection system delivers vaccine skin . However , Derma Vax ( Trademark ) system studied human , research need determine whether new vaccine delivery method safe tolerable , particularly term pain level skin reaction . Objectives : - To evaluate safety , effectiveness , relative pain level intradermal electroporation use Derma Vax ( Trademark ) administer pretreatment either topical cream anesthetic placebo cream . Eligibility : - Healthy individual 18 55 year age . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram . - Participants two different cream apply upper arm : one cream anesthetic ( lidocaine prilocaine ) placebo lotion . Each arm receive different cream . - Once cream take effect , participant receive Derma Vax ( Trademark ) treatment . No actual medication give injection ; participant evaluate reaction base pressure needle stick alone . - Immediately treatment , participant use Visual Analogue Scale pain intensity provide description level pain experienced injection . - Participants complete additional questionnaire pain intensity inject skin site inspect determine possible reaction injection . They also ask opinion whether ( base pain level ) series Derma Vax ( Trademark ) treatment would acceptable treatment serious illness . - The day injection , participant return additional skin assessment treat area .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Our primary objective : ass safety tolerability Intradermal electroporation ( IDEP ) use Derma Vax ( Trademark ) administer pretreatment either EMLA ( Registered Trademark ) cream topical anesthetic placebo determine EMLA ( Registered Trademark ) cream apply electroporation site significantly decrease pain associate IDEP procedure . Our secondary objective : determine magnitude pain perception IDEP ; determine quality pain perception IDEP use Visual Analog Scale McGill pain scale ; determine time course IDEP Pain rating skin irritation determine variation skin resistance without EMLA ( Registered Trademark ) cream participant . Experimental Design Methods : Twelve healthy men woman recruit study . This randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled study medical device . Each subject receive EMLA ( Registered Trademark ) cream control cream place electroporation site deltoid area blind randomized manner . This follow IDEP administration pre-treated deltoid area . Medical Relevance Expected Outcome : DNA vaccine promise treatment infectious disease cancer . The ideal delivery method induction cellular humoral immune response define . Information study necessary future study use Derma Vax ( Trademark ) therapeutic DNA vaccine study . Derma Vax ( Trademark ) unique propriety deliver series electric pulse provoke DNA uptake antigen present cell reside dermal layer skin . We expect application Intradermal Electroporation ( IDEP ) use Derma Vax ( Trademark ) well tolerate use EMLA ( Registered Trademark ) cream decrease pain compare placebo .</detailed_description>
