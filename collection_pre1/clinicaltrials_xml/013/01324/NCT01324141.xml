	<brief_summary>Background : - Radiation chemotherapy treatment anal cancer cause irritation skin lead redness tenderness , case severe result blister peel skin treatment . These condition cause discomfort may require break radiation treatment . Researchers interested determine whether MTS-01 , drug protects cell tissue effect radiation , give radiation treatment prevent side effect reduce irritation skin chemotherapy radiation anal cancer . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness topical MTS-01 give radiation groin gluteal cleft patient receive combine radiation chemotherapy anal cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose cancer anal canal eligible receive radiation chemotherapy treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , image study physical examination anal canal , biopsy need evaluate eligibility treatment . - Participants schedule radiation chemotherapy treatment follow schedule : - Radiation give 5 day per week 6 week , topical MTS-01 treatment skin groin area buttocks treatment - Mitomycin C give intravenously day 1 29 treatment - 5-Fluorouracil give intravenously 4 day ( first week fifth week ) radiation treatment - Participants monitor throughout treatment side effect , photograph treatment area frequent blood test . - Following end radiation , participant followup visit 1 year blood test image study evaluate response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Patients non-metastatic carcinoma anal canal treat concurrent mitomycin C ( MMC ) , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , radiotherapy ( RT ) curative set attempt preserve anal sphincter . - Radiation dermatitis uniform complication therapy frequently result treatment delay due pain discomfort . High grade dermatitis may also become superinfected set decreased blood count chemotherapy diarrhea radiation proctitis , delay therapy . Approaches decrease toxicity may particularly important patient infected HIV . - MTS-01 ( tempol , 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl ) piperidine nitroxide know act chemical radioprotector selective protection normal versus tumor tissue . - Tempol gel ( tempol 70 mg/mL plus water , ethanol , hydroxypropyl cellulose ) evaluate topical radioprotector pilot trial include variety site . Objectives : - Primary Objective : To determine safety tolerability topical MTS-01 daily basis prior irradiation groin gluteal cleft patient receive combined therapy MMC , 5-FU , RT carcinoma anal canal . - Secondary Objectives include evaluation follow endpoint preliminary fashion : - To describe rate severity skin toxicity patient treat regimen - To describe need toxicity relate treatment break regimen - To describe opiate requirement patient treat regimen - To describe 12-month progression-free survival , disease-free survival , overall survival patient treat concurrent chemotherapy , radiation therapy , MTS-01 - Evaluate effect antiretroviral therapy , 5-fluorouracil , mitomycin C , radiation low level persistent HIV viremia HIV genetic diversity therapy recovery - To evaluate feasibility collect HIV RNA mononuclear cell rectal associate lymphoid tissue correlative study - Collect store anal cytology core needle biopsy tumor future HPV tumor base analysis Eligibility : - Age great equal 18 year . - ECOG performance status less equal 2 . - Histologically confirm carcinoma anal canal without evidence distant metastases - No contraindication definitive chemoradiotherapy carcinoma anal canal Design : This pilot trial topical MTS-01 patient receive MMC , 5-FU , IMRT definitive management carcinoma anal canal . Fifteen patient enrol . MMC deliver dose 10mg/m ( 2 ) day 1 29 . 5-FU delivered 1000mg/m ( 2 ) /day 96 hour continuous infusion begin day 1 29 . RT deliver total dose 50-54 Gy base tumor characteristic . Tempol gel apply bilateral groin gluteal cleft , avoid 3 cm radius anal verge , immediately prior fraction RT . RTOG grade use evaluate skin toxicity groin gluteal cleft weekly treatment 4 week , 3 month 6 month completion treatment . The duration treatment , number treatment break , opiate requirement , level pain evaluated weekly treatment 4 week 3 month completion treatment . Disease control assess 4 week , 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , 12 month follow-up .</detailed_description>
