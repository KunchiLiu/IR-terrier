	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Multiple Injection KH902 Patients With Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With improvement live standard , patient suffer Diabetes become . As investigator know , Diabetes induce many ocular disease lead vision loss . And accord observation , DME diagnose one main cause vision loss patient Diabetes . As result many study conduct previously , anti-VEGF drug anti-VEGF treatment show effect safety treat AMD , also patient DME . The new drug Recombinant Human VEGF Receptor-Fc Fusion Protein ( KH902 ) gene fusion protein . The previous clinical trial KH902 show KH902 effective safe inhibiting growth , migration , pullulation vascular endothelial cell neovascularization induce VEGF . Due positive result , investigator prepare conduct clinical trial ass safety efficacy intravitreal injection KH902 patient DME .</detailed_description>
