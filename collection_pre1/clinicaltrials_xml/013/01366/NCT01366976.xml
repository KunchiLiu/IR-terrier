	<brief_summary>Acute kidney injury major complication cardiac surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . Hemolysis rhabdomyolysis frequently occur CPB . Hemolysis lead increase free hemoglobin , whereas rhabdomyolysis lead increase myoglobin . Free plasma hemoglobin myoglobin show independent predictor acute kidney injury result CPB . When hemeproteins release plasma , undergo redox cycling , generate radical specie initiate lipid peroxidation cascade oxidative damage cellular membrane , notably kidney . F2-isoprostanes isofurans sensitive specific marker oxidative stress vivo , increase CPB , particularly patient acute kidney injury . Acetaminophen inhibit lipid peroxidation catalyze myoglobin hemoglobin . Moreover , animal model rhabdomyolysis-induced kidney injury , acetaminophen significantly attenuate decrease creatinine clearance compare control . The current proposal test central hypothesis acetaminophen attenuate lipid peroxidation associate hemolysis rhabdomyolysis occur patient undergoing CPB . Demonstration acetaminophen inhibits lipid peroxidation result CPB would provide rationale prospective randomize trial test hypothesis acetaminophen reduce acute kidney injury result CPB .</brief_summary>
