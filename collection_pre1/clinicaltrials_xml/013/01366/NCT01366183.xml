	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Toxicity On Quality Life Older Patients With Stage I , Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial , Primary Peritoneal Cavity , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : l. To determine whether score Instrumental Activities Daily Living ( IADL ) obtain prior treatment associate ability patient complete four cycle chemotherapy without dose reduction 7-day delay . II . To estimate regimen percentage patient able complete four cycle chemotherapy regardless dose reduction delay . III . To compare actual calculate carboplatin area curve ( AUC ) patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe percentage patient enter primary surgery versus enter receive primary neoadjuvant chemotherapy , percentage patient treat allowed regimen , percentage patient eventually receive surgery primary chemotherapy group . II . To determine whether need assistance IADLs time registration associate choice chemotherapy regimen ( primary chemotherapy primary surgery patient ) . III . To explore whether age , baseline score geriatric measure ( functional status , nutritional status , co-morbidity ) quality-of-life ( QOL ) correlate likelihood complete four course chemotherapy without dose reduction 7-day delay . IV . To explore reason time dose reduction delay . V. To describe toxicity , pre-/post-chemotherapy QOL , pre-/post-chemotherapy score geriatric measure patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore potential relationship carboplatin AUC , paclitaxel clearance , paclitaxel time plasma concentration 0.05 mcM nadir neutrophil platelet count course 1 treatment . II . To explore association baseline IADL survival . III . To explore association IADL functional well-being ( FWB ) subscale Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy - Ovary ( FACT-O ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive chemotherapy comprising carboplatin , paclitaxel , filgrastim ( regimen 1 ) carboplatin alone ( regimen 2 ) every 21 day 4 course accord physician and/or patient ' choice . Patients may undergo surgery and/or chemotherapy discretion treat physician . Patients undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically course 1 pharmacokinetic study . Patients ' quality life assess FACT-O , Functional Assessment Cancer Treatment - Neurotoxicity ( FACT-Ntx subscale ) , IADL , Ability Complete Social Activity questionnaires baseline , prior course 1 3 , 3-6 week completion course 4 . Nutritional status , body mass index weight loss , comorbidity hearing impairment also assess .</detailed_description>
