	<brief_summary>Chronic GVHD medical condition may occur bone marrow , stem cell cord blood transplant . The donor 's immune system may recognize body ( host ) foreign attempt 'reject ' . This process know graft-versus-host-disease . It think IL-2 may help control chronic GVHD stop donor 's immune system 'rejecting ' body . In research study , look see IL-2 used combination steroid treat cGVHD .</brief_summary>
