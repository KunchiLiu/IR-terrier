	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether administration two investigational malaria vaccine ( 257049 Ad35.CS.01 vaccine ) combine one immunization schedule increase protection malaria infection compare protection induce 257049 vaccine alone . The study also evaluate safety immune response new combination two experimental malaria vaccine .</brief_summary>
