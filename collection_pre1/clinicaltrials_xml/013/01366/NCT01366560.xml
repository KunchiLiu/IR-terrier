	<brief_title>Effect GSK962040 Oesophageal Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motilin peptide find specific endocrine cell epithelia upper small intestine . It release fast act receptor ( motilin receptor , previously know GPR38 ) result initiation Phase III migrate motor complex ( MMC ) . MMCs begin upper region gut usually characterize three distinct phase ( I , period near-quiescence ; II , short- non-propulsive contraction irregular frequency ; III , final burst high amplitude propulsive contraction ) , terminate within distal region small intestine . Phase III activity may help clear stomach intestine undigested material , prevent bacterial overgrowth upper gut perhaps help develop sensation hunger . The association motilin release Phase III MMC , together ability motilin mimic strong propulsive contraction comprise Phase III , argue involvement motilin regulation certain function gut fast . Motilin receptor agonist increase gastric empty ingestion meal ; action mediate via cholinergic system stomach . Erythromycin motilides ( non-peptide derivative macrolide antibiotic devoid antibiotic activity ) motilin receptor agonist effective gastroprokinetic agent patient . Erythromycin show stimulate gastric empty patient diabetic , idiopathic post-vagotomy gastroparesis , critically-ill patient receive enteral nutrition , EM574 KC 11458 , peptide motilin receptor agonist atilmotin , also increase gastric empty human . In addition effect gastric emptying , motilin also appear produce effect oesophageal musculature . In particular , several study show single dos motilin agonist ( erythromycin healthy volunteer patient gastro-oesophageal reflux disease ( GORD ) , atilmotin , peptide motilin agonist , healthy volunteer ) , increase low oesophageal sphincter ( LOS ) pressure various dose dependent effect oesophageal peristaltic amplitude propulsive contraction healthy volunteer patient GORD . In addition , evidence reduction GORD patient use motilin agonist may useful clinically . For example , recent study patient follow lung transplantation , demonstrate azithromycin , motilin agonist macrolide antibiotic , reduced number reflux event total oesophageal acid exposure well reduce proximal extent reflux regurgitate . The clinical trial promotility agent GORD , however , show consistent benefit . This may relate compound characteristic . The dynamic relationship PK effect oesophageal function may factor consistent data support role prokinetics GORD come study administer drug intravenously , route administration would suitable broad GORD population . In addition , high dos macrolides required effect GORD , risk overlap antibiotic therapeutic dos , would limit interest approach . Macrolides also induce side effect nausea abdominal , make macrolides difficult tolerate many patient . Another factor consider repeat administration macrolides induces desensitization motilin receptor reduce efficacy time , phenomenon call tachyphylaxis . A strategy decrease tachyphylaxis stimulation motilin receptor identify agent possess complex motilide structure like erythromycin . This approach take GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) identify GSK962040 , small molecule motilin receptor agonist , motilide . GSK962040 design use recombinant human motilin receptor enhance specificity receptor potentially decrease negative characteristic encounter compound complex non-specific motilide structure . A range vitro vivo study conduct use GSK962040 investigate primary , secondary safety pharmacology toxicology . In addition , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , absorption , distribution , metabolism elimination GSK962040 investigate non-clinical specie series oral intravenous study . The First Time Human ( FTIH ) study ( MOT107043 ) GSK962040 complete . It ascend single dose , randomise , placebo-controlled trial , dose range 1-150 mg ass safety tolerability , PK pharmacodynamic effect gastric empty ( GE ) healthy male female volunteer . Dosing GSK962040 well tolerate . The result demonstrate GSK962040 approximate dose proportional PK profile . Single dose GSK962040 range 1 150 mg result mean exposure le 23 μg.h/mL ( AUC ) . At single dos 50 mg 150 mg , rate GE measure 13C-octanoic acid breath test significantly increase healthy volunteer compare placebo . Increasing dose 50 mg result great effect GE . The mean within subject time half [ 13C ] -containing meal empty stomach ( GE t½ ) decrease 22-43 % placebo GSK962040 50 , 75 , 125 150 mg single dos ( p ≤ 0.02 ) . Increases rate gastric emptying occur 85 % 100 % healthy subject receive 50 150 mg dos . The 14-day repeat dose study healthy volunteer ( MOT109681 ) ascend dose , randomise , placebo-controlled trial range 10 mg 125 mg daily . GSK962040 well tolerate 14- day administration period dos test exhibit predictable PK , without food . The result indicate GE enhance dos 50 mg , throughout 14-day dosing . GSK962040 currently Phase II clinical development , investigate intensive care patient receive enteral feeding , patient diabetic gastroparesis . The present study investigate effect GSK962040 oesophageal function combination enhance GE , barrier function ( i.e . increase LOS pressure ) oesophageal clearance would potentially beneficial patient GORD regurgitation . Non clinical clinical data indicate motilin agonist GSK962040 may also influence oesophageal function well GE . The purpose present study primarily evaluate physiological effect clinical dos GSK962040 oesophageal function healthy volunteer , use establish method ( oesophageal manometry , ambulatory pH/Impedance monitoring ) . GE also measure , use wireless motility capsule ( WMC ) monitoring . Given physiological assessment , use healthy volunteer consider appropriate ; addition , study population comprise male volunteer order reduce variability measurement therefore sample size , GE vary gender . The information study inform decision make whether GSK962040 could utility condition low oesophageal function derange GORD .</detailed_description>
