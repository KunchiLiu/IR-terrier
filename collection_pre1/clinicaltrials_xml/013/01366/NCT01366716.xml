	<brief_summary>Contingency management ( CM ) demonstrably efficacious intervention substance abuse dependence . Although CM protocols employ variety reinforcer , almost exclusively relied upon non-cash privilege ( e.g. , take-home methadone dos ) , prize , voucher exchange good service . Despite strong empirical support CM , research suggest concern relate cost safety ( e.g. , potential harm cause reward undermine intrinsic motivation sell purchase drug ) hinder transfer real-world practice . The exclusive use non-cash CM likely stem untested assumption client use cash incentive buy drug engage high-risk behavior . This assumption problematic two reason . First , use non-cash incentive may add substantial cost complexity CM protocol . Second , use non-cash incentive may reduce efficacy CM intervention , research suggest cash may effective reinforcer voucher . This study examine practical ethical issue relate cash-based CM procedure . This study consist three phase ; main experiment , `` Cash Bowl '' pilot , `` Thinning '' Pilot .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Contingency Management Cocaine Dependence : Cash Versus Vouchers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In main phase study , use 3-group randomized study compare efficacy , cost-effectiveness , ethic ( 1 ) voucher-based CM intervention , ( 2 ) cash-based CM intervention , ( 3 ) non-CM intervention . Two hundred thirty seven consent cocaine-dependent client randomly assign one three condition . In main examined outcome relate ( 1 ) efficacy , include UDS-confirmed abstinence counsel attendance ; ( 2 ) cost-effectiveness ; ( 3 ) ethic , include effect intrinsic motivation , drug use , high-risk behavior . This investigation address practical issue pertain transfer CM intervention community-based treatment program , provide empirical evidence refute ethical criticism levy use cash CM intervention . The second phase expand main study pilot examination probabilistic reinforcement CM schedule . Probabilistic method consider less expensive implement yet equally efficacious , reward provide time target behavior exhibit , yet similar outcome result . In pilot study , additional 70 participant randomize either traditional voucher-based probability reinforcement CM schedule , ( `` FishBowl '' CM ) , cash-based probability reinforcement CM schedule ( `` CashBowl '' CM ) , standard non-CM intervention . As main study , examine condition term efficacy , associate cost cost-effectiveness , potential ethical risk . The third phase study pilot seek examine efficacy traditional `` thinning '' reinforcement schedule compare escalating reinforcement schedule treatment-as-usual ( non-contingency management control ) condition improve during-treatment post-treatment outcome cocaine dependent outpatient community-based treatment . Participants randomly assign one three treatment condition : Escalating CM Condition ( n = 15 ) , Traditional ( `` thin '' ) CM Condition ( n = 15 ) , Non-CM Control Condition ( n = 15 ) . The intervention last total 16 week . Participants assign experimental condition receive different contingency reward procedure study week 1-12 ; receive identical contingency reward procedure study week 13-16 . Participants assign control condition receive contingency reward entire 16 week study . As main study , examine condition term efficacy , associate cost cost-effectiveness , potential ethical risk .</detailed_description>
