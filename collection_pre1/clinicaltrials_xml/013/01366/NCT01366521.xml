Mepolizumab currently development severe refractory asthma Phase IIB dose-ranging study use IV route administration currently on-going . This study multi-center , randomize , open-label , parallel-group , repeat dose study conduct approximately 65 subject establish asthma elevate blood eosinophil level . Dosing occur three occasion , every four week [ Day 1 , Day 28 ( +/- 3 day ) Day 56 ( +/- 3 day ) ] . Blood sample safety , pharmacodynamics ( PD ) , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) immunogenicity analysis , well safety tolerability assessment collected/assessed throughout study .
