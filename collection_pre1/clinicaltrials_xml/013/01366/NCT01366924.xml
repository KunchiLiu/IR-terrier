	<brief_summary>The modern warfighter face numerous physiological challenge include sleep deprivation , sustain intense physical activity , caloric restriction , combine effect may result loss lean body mass decrease physical performance . Dietary intervention may help preserve lean body mass facilitate recovery period intense physical demand . For example , dietary strategy increase amino acid availability show stimulate protein synthesis skeletal muscle follow resistance exercise . Because military task also incorporate endurance exercise component , study regard effect increase dietary amino acid follow endurance exercise warrant . The objective study characterize effect endurance exercise protein synthesis breakdown well ability essential amino acid supplement influence skeletal muscle protein metabolism cellular molecular regulation follow endurance exercise .</brief_summary>
