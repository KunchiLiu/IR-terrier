	<brief_summary>In study , investigator propose use negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) aid wound heal along line closure low extremity amputation complex abdominal wound . This study design prospective , randomized clinical trial evaluate effectiveness NPWT versus accept standard surgical dressing wound . Study participant randomize one two treatment group ( NPWT vs. standard dress ) prior surgery , follow post operative period monitor effect surgical closure . The experimental group consist participant receive NPWT Vacuum Assisted Closure ( V.A.C. , KCI inc. ) device place intra-op along line closure . The control group receive standard surgical dry sterile dress . The surgical closure assess three day treatment well first outpatient post-op visit subsequent visit follow 6 month . By , investigator hope demonstrate utility NPWT difficult , risk surgical closure . Additionally , investigator hope show difference clinical outcome incision treat NPWT current standard technique . All patient principal co-investigators practice schedule undergo low extremity amputation complex abdominal closure eligible enrollment prospective randomize study . There exclusion criterion . Informed consent obtain pre-operatively . Data collection include basic demographic data , disease history , past medical social history well key data relate wound healing ( infection , wind dehiscence breakdown ) hospital course ( length stay , operative complication ) . The investigator use simple statistical method ( ANOVA chi-squared analysis ) compare surgical wound heal two population . The deviation current standard care population include utilizing V.A.C . system closure line experimental group versus standard dry sterile dressing .</brief_summary>
