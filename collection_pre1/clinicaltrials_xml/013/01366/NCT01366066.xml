	<brief_summary>During transcutaneous mechanical nerve stimulation spinal cord injure men increase pressure observed external urethral sphincter along increase bladder capacity . In subsequent study demonstrate Transcutaneous Mechanical Nerve Stimulation ( TMNS ) woman could induce pressure increment external urethral sphincter . A pilot study since show 6 week stimulation 24 33 woman suffer urinary stress incontinence able contract pelvic floor muscle become free symptom . Another pilot study show promising effect overactive bladder syndrome . The present study aim treat urinary incontinence include 2 group patient 30 patient group : Women suffer urinary stress incontinence woman suffer urge incontinence . A medical vibrator use group subject randomize vibration treatment vibration treatment . All patient receive pelvic floor train woman suffer urge incontinence receive anticholinergic medication . The stimulation perform perineum every day 6 week amplitude 2 mm frequency 100 Hz . Results evaluate basis questionnaire , micturition diary diaper test . If investigator able demonstrate significant reduction incontinence symptom subject investigator asses vibration way reestablish normal function pelvic floor muscle bladder function incontinent patient .</brief_summary>
