	<brief_summary>GSK plan undertake two anti-obesity drug study area obesity . In addition assessment questionnaire , would significant value incorporate objective non-interventional measure cognitive motivational processing associate evaluate respond food stimulus . Obesity associate increase attentional bias palatable food . The aim protocol two-fold , first characterize Event Related Potentials ( ERPs ) two common aspect food stimulus relevant eat disorder -presence food palatability , secondly , assess modulation ERPs appetite . Following successful completion study , intention use paradigm develop future study area obesity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Characterize Event Related Potential Markers Attentional Bias Towards Words Images Food</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GlaxoSmithKline currently develop number drug treatment overheat include 'binge eat ' obesity . Historically , behavioural effectiveness anti-obesity drug clinical drug trial utilise subjective rating scale ass person 's drive motivation eat . Findings study good construct validity , suffer shortcoming self-reporting , e.g . subject bias , dishonesty , misinterpretation . It follow addition self-reporting , would strengthen interpretation future study anti-obesity drug , objective measure brain activity relation cognitive/motivational process associate evaluation respond food relate cue . Measuring event relate potential ( ERPs ) cognitive process food relate cue , use electroencephalography technique ( EEG ) offer alternative objective approach examine effectives anti-obesity drug . This protocol propose develop use two cognitive task examine response food relate cue ( pictorial word ) concurrent record ERPs , order characterize neurophysiological event associate attentional bias towards food relate stimulus . The first task image processing task . This task use food image similar International Affective Picture System ( IAPS ) use ERP study perceptual process emotional stimulus [ Olofsson , 2008 ; Schupp , 2006 ] . In task subject view different category image ; palatable high-calorie food image , non-palatable low-calorie food image non-edible plant image . The latter neutral category ERPs two food category compare . Affective picture use assess emotional valence measure difference anterior ERP measurement image differ group . The protocol also propose measure late positive potential order ass high level cognitive processing possibly early memory formation . Again , proposal assess AUCs , case 400-600 m region look difference curve late potential potential different valency stimulus . For late positive potential , anterior laterality also assess . The second task cued-target task visuospatial attention motivationally salient word . The task version Posner paradigm . The appearance food nonfood word inside top bottom frame ( cue ) distract attention subject towards spatial location . Following word either one two frame change appearance ( target ) . In addition emotion attention measure , protocol proposes assess standard N1 , P1 P3 [ Luck , 2005 ] . After complete ERP recording subject ask rate picture salience valence order provide comparison objective neurophysiological subjective attention emotional rating .</detailed_description>
