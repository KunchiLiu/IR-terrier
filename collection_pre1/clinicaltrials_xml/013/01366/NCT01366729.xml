	<brief_summary>Background 9000 people year Switzerland suffer first time stroke . Of 20 30 % remain unable walk 60 % leave moderate severe walk disability . Evidence show rehabilitation technique emphasise use hemiplegic side influence ipsilesional cortical plasticity improve functional outcome . Canes commonly use gait rehabilitation although significantly reduce hemiplegic muscle activity . We show orthosis `` TheraTogs '' ( elastic corset support hemiplegic side ) significantly increase hemiplegic muscle activity gait . To date clinical study investigate long term effect techniques gait recovery follow stroke . This study aim determine advance understand cortical plasticity relation functional recovery follow stroke apply clinical gait rehabilitation improve long term outcome . Hypotheses Early gait rehabilitation cane reduce hemiplegic muscle activity inhibit balance reaction . In long term cause poorer walk ability balance consequently reduce social participation . Early gait rehabilitation TheraTogs increase hemiplegic muscle activity facilitate balance reaction . In long term improve walk ability balance lead increase social independence participation . Design Multi-centred , single blind , randomize control trial . Subjects 120 first time stroke patient Intervention When subject walk unaided even ground whilst require verbal prompt stand-by help without body contact ( FAC 3 ) randomly allocate intervention ( TheraTogs ) control ( cane ) group . TheraTogs apply support hip extensor abductor musculature accord standardized procedure . Cane walk cane level radial styloid sound wrist . Subjects walk throughout day assign walk aid . Standard therapy treatment usual care remain unchanged documented.The intervention continue five week patient reach FAC 5 ( independent walker surface ) . Measures : day intervention begin , day intervention completion ( max 5 week ) , 3 month , 6 month 2 year completion Primary outcome Timed `` go '' test Secondary outcomes surface EMG hemiplegic low extremity musculature , temporo-spatial gait parameter , hip kinematics , dynamic balance . The Stroke Impact Scale . Results Significance level 5 % 95 % CI ` . ITT analyse perform . Descriptive statistic present . Relevant co-variables identify analysed . Discussion This study could significant implication clinical practice gait rehabilitation stroke particular effect appropriate use walking aid</brief_summary>
