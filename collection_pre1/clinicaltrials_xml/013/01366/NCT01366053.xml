	<brief_summary>This Phase IV observational trial intend identify patient fail GnRH agonist therapy evidence rise PSA yet initiate secondary manoeuvre involve antiandrogens . This group may include non-metastatic well metastatic patient . The trial determine patient benefit switch Degarelix . It assess effect Degarelix 's direct mode action androgen level whether continuous use Degarelix improve disease progression . As per CUA Guidelines Management CRPC , androgen receptor remain active patient develop castration resistant disease , recommend ADT continue ( LEVEL 3 , GRADE C ) . Therefore , logical continue patient Degarelix throughout castrate resistant period . This allow gathering data currently unknown within set , effect combine treatment antiandrogens well chemotherapy castrate resistant treatment .</brief_summary>
