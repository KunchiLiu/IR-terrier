	<brief_summary>The primary objective pilot study identify quantify inflammatory genetic marker bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) serum patient history chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) undergo elective coronary revascularization ( CABG ) determine risk develop post operative respiratory failure . To achieve objective , proposal outline follow specific aim : Aim # 1 . To identify BALF serum , change inflammatory genetic marker patient history COPD undergoing CABG . BALF serum sample obtain time intubation immediately prior surgery upon skin closure immediately surgical procedure . Aim # 2 . To determine extent inflammatory and/or genetic marker correlate post-operative pulmonary complication define prolonged mechanical ventilation ( &gt; 24 hour ) , pneumonia , and/or tracheostomy . Aim # 3 . To inform development implementation large pivotal trial may impact clinical decision-making initial pre-operative outpatient assessment COPD patient undergo CABG .</brief_summary>
