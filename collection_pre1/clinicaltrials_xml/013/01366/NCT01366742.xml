	<detailed_description>The natural history HPV likely influence innate adaptive mucosal immunity . More specifically , hypothesize Toll like receptor ( TLRs ) play important role cervical innate immunity HPV secretion proinflammatory , chemotactic anti-viral cytokine . Up-regulated TLR expression also result activation dendritic cell T cell turn promote Thl like response secretion several cytokine consequently , induction successful cell mediate immune ( CMI ) response . We propose : 1 ) examine , cervical cell sample , association among TRL expression , TRL-associated cytokine mediate innate immunity clearance incident HPV infection ; 2 ) examine , cervical cell sample , association among TRL expression , TRL-associated cytokine induce mediate adaptive immunity HPV clearance ; 3 ) examine association among TLR induce Th-1 response measure cervical cell sample , HPV specific CMI response detect peripheral blood ( PB ) HPV clearance . Adolescent young woman ) enter cohort initial 1990-1995 period continue followed b ) enter cohort last recruitment wave ( 2000-2005 ) ask continue followup additional five year ( 2005-2010 ) . These woman well characterized time initiation study HPV entry visit 4-month interval sample HPV DNA , cytology , bacterial vaginosis , colpophotographs ( assessment cervical maturation ) , C. trachomatis N. gonorrhea testing , cervical cell cytokine reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) peripheral blood ( PB ) CMI HPV 16 positive woman . Women continue characterized interval through-out follow-up . Measures innate adaptive immunity RT PCR use cervical cell Luminex technology add 4 month interval test HPV DNA , cytology cervical cytokine describe . Women positive HPV 16 get additional blood CMI use Interferon ( IFN ) -y Enzyme link immunospot ( EliSpot ) technique detection anti-E6 E7 response . We also examine natural history anal HPV woman . We acknowledge design simplifies pleiotropic nature cytokine . However , feel model reflect plausible mechanism involve HPV control feasible test cohort . Information garner type study critical develop vaccine strategy therapy well illuminate immune response develop mucosal epithelium .</detailed_description>
