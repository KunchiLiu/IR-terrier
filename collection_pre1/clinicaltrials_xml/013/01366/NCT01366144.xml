	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together paclitaxel carboplatin treat patient solid tumor metastatic remove surgery liver kidney dysfunction . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving veliparib together paclitaxel carboplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics ABT-888 ( veliparib ) patient vary degree renal hepatic dysfunction . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) ABT-888 combination carboplatin paclitaxel patient vary degree liver kidney dysfunction . III . To provide dose recommendation ABT-888 combination carboplatin paclitaxel base degree hepatic renal impairment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) toxicity associate use combination patient vary degree renal hepatic dysfunction . II . To evaluate pharmacokinetic parameter ABT-888 , carboplatin , paclitaxel administer combination patient vary degree renal hepatic dysfunction . III . To evaluate pharmacodynamic measurement poly-ADP-ribosylated ( PAR ) platinum adduct tumor cell associate use combination patient vary degree renal hepatic dysfunction . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study veliparib . Patients receive veliparib* orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : * All patient receive single dose veliparib PO day -6 course 1 ( except patient severe renal dysfunction receive veliparib day -5 -6 coincide dialysis day ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
