	<brief_title>Nutritional Intervention Children With Autism Using Whey Protein ( Immunocal ) : Impact Core Areas Behavior</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary : Autism neurodevelopmental disorder currently affect many 1 150 child United States . Autism consider many permanent condition little hope improvement . The treatment autism center special schooling behavioral therapy ; conventional medical treatment little impact ameliorate disorder . Recent research discover autistic individual increase marker oxidative stress degree mitochondrial dysfunction . Furthermore , genetic abnormality glutathione pathway associate autism . Thus , propose nutritional supplement base bovine milk serum contain cysteine-rich whey protein serve glutathione precursor improve behavioral function child Autism . Hypothesis : Many child autism impair antioxidant/detoxification capacity chronic oxidative stress . Studies also show autistic child show abnormally high prevalence glutathione deficiency . A cysteine-rich whey protein supplement demonstrate raise glutathione level improve metabolic imbalance improve measure autistic behavior . Purpose : This study evaluate effect cysteine-rich whey protein isolate supplement ( Immunocal® ) autistic behavior pre-school child autism . Methods : This 3 month double-blind placebo-controlled study . A total 60 subject selected/recruited enrolled ( see inclusion exclusion criterion ) minimum 40 evaluable child ( include estimate drop-outs ) range age 3 5 year old participate study data record collect . Children randomly assign either treatment- study product ( Immunocal ) control ( rice protein ) three month ( 20 subject per group ) . Core area autistic behavior assess ( baseline/week 0 ) , end treatment ( week 12 ) : atypical autistic behavior severity , communication , developmental status behavioral problem . In addition , blood glutathione level quantify treatment . Side effect adverse reaction compare two group ( baseline/week 0 ) end treatment ( week 12 ) .</detailed_description>
