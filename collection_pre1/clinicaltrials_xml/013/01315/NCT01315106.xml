	<criteria>1 . Patient schedule contrastenhanced breast MRI image possible breast cancer . 2 . Female 3 . Age &gt; 18 1 . Lactation 2 . Pregnancy 3 . Patient undergoing chemotherapy . These patient exclude chemotherapy change biology breast cancer . Since ultimate objective research develop new image method breast MRI screening ( detection previously unknown tumor ) , result treat tumor would relevant . Including treated tumor could yield misleading assessment performance new method since treat tumor different image characteristic de novo tumor . 4 . Patient schedule preoperative chemotherapy . These patient exclude go treated basis fine needle aspiration . The project seek correlate tumor detect standard histopathology untreated neoplasm . This exclusion criterion unusual patient plan neoadjuvant chemotherapy basis prechemo core needle biopsy , provide adequate histopathologic proof necessary enrollment .</criteria>
