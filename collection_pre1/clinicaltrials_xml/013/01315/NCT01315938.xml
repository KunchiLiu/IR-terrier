	<criteria>1 . Patients definite probable polymyositis dermatomyositis diagnose accord diagnostic criterion Bohan Peter ( 30,31 ) . 2 . For polymyositis muscle biopsy require confirmed disease ( performed time start study ) exclude condition unless patient positive myositis specific myositis associate autoantibody . 3 . Polymyositis include judicial process three PIs . 4 . Inflammatory active disease base persist worsen muscle weakness , MMT &lt; 150 low endurance , FI 2 &lt; 20 % upper value together least one sign active disease : elevate serum level muscle enzyme ( CK , LD , ASAT , ALAT , upper limit explain muscle involvement eg liver disease ) , inflammation recent muscle biopsy ( &lt; 3 month ) MRI scan active extramuscular disease : skin rash , arthritis interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) ( suggest chest Xray , high resolution computerize tomography ( HRCT ) , pulmonary function test ) . 5 . Persisting disease activity minimum 3 month treatment prednisolone equal drug . The treatment prednisolone ( equal ) include dose least 0.5 mg/kg/day least 1 month history stable 1 month prior baseline visit . Maximum dose glucocorticoid exceed equivalent Prednisone 30 mg per day time randomisation . 6 . Combination least one immunosuppressive drug , include methotrexate ( minimum dose 15 mg/week ) azathioprine ( minimum dose 100 mg/day ) least 3 month . The dose methotrexate azathioprine stable least 1 month first administration abatacept . 7 . If methotrexate azathioprine stop dose decreased due document intolerance , low dose absence drug accept provided situation stable 1 month baseline . 8 . Age 18 80 year . 9 . Signed informed consent . 1 . Patients types inflammatory myopathy include Drug induce myositis . Inclusion body myositis Malignancy associate myositis . 2 . Women pregnant breastfeeding . 3 . Women positive pregnancy test enrolment prior start study drug administration . 4 . Women Child Bearing age unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period 10 week last infusion study medication . 5 . Current symptom severe , progressive , uncontrolled renal , hepatic , hematological , gastrointestinal , pulmonary , cardiac , neurological , ophthalmologic cerebral disease exception symptom manifestation polymyositis dermatomyositis . Concomitant medical condition opinion investigator might place subject unacceptable risk participation study . 6 . Subjects history cancer within last five year ( nonmelanoma skin cell cancer cure local resection ) . Existing nonmelanoma skin cell cancer must remove prior dose . Patients dermatomyositis need screen malignancy accord routine procedure . 7 . Subjects history clinically significant drug alcohol abuse . Subjects currently take methotrexate admit consumption average 1 alcoholic drink per day . 8 . Subjects serious bacterial infection ( pneumonia , renal infection sinusitis ) , unless treat resolve antibiotic chronic bacterial infection ( pyelonephritis chest infection bronchiectasis ) previous 3 month . 9 . Subjects active tuberculosis require treatment within previous 3 year . Subjects positive PPD screen eligible study unless complete treatment latent TB negative chest xray enrolment . A PPD response equal great 10 mm consider positive test , although conservative criterion may apply determined clinical circumstance investigator accord publish guideline and/or local standard endorse medical society . Quantiferon assay may replace PPD test patient exclude study test positive . Quantiferon positive patient complete treatment latent tuberculosis accord local guideline may consider enrolment . 10 . Subjects herpes zoster resolve less 2 month prior enrolment . 11 . Subjects evidence ( assessed Investigator ) active latent bacterial viral infection time potential enrolment , include subject evidence Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection . 12 . Significant toxicity associate concomitant previous immunosuppressive Therapy antiTNF therapy would preclude subject participate complete study 13 . Patients clinically apparent immunodeficiency syndrome , ( IgA deficiency alone exclusion criterion ) 14 . Subjects follow laboratory value : Hgb &lt; 8.5 g/dL . WBC &lt; 3,000/mm3 ( 3 x 109/L ) . Platelets &lt; 100,000/mm3 ( 100 x 109/L ) . Serum creatinine &gt; 2 time upper limit normal . Any laboratory test result , opinion investigator , might place subject unacceptable risk participation study . 15 . Subjects previously treat rituximab : B cell level less low limit normal measure Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting ( FACS ) analysis . 16 . For patient receive prior rituximab , normal CD19 B cell count must document time screen study . 17 . Patients Large granular lymphocyte ( LGL ) syndrome ( minimize risk include patient high frequency CD28 null T cell ) may benefit treatment .</criteria>
