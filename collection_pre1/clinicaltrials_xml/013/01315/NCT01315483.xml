	<brief_summary>In United States , overweight ( BMI &gt; 25 &lt; 30 Kg/m2 ) obesity ( BMI &gt; 30Kg/m2 ) increase epidemic rate . A significant association exists overweight obese breast cancer recurrence survival . However , evidence continue accumulate indicate achieve maintain healthy weight height ( Body Mass Index , BMI , 18.5-25Kg/m2 ) associate reduce risk breast cancer decrease breast cancer associate mortality . Despite , lack randomize controlled trial explore association process fat loss successful actually reach healthy weight height differentially affect biomarkers cancer recurrence . Many dietary approach weight loss currently available public , purport offer advantage . However , little scientific evidence indicate dietary approach , vary markedly food limit exclude , affect biomarkers breast cancer risk . In particular , know whether critical factor relation weight breast cancer simply weight loss ( negative energy balance ) , irrespective manner achieve , certain dietary approach affect breast cancer risk biomarkers favorably others . Published data laboratory suggest dietary pattern matter , therefore goal study investigate effect two popular weight loss dietary approach differ extent limit carbohydrate fat consumption ( effect dietary glycemic load ) compare usual care group prognostic marker cancer recurrence postmenopausal breast cancer survivor . The investigator hypothesize addition anticipate effect fat loss circulating level bioavailable sex steroid hormone , effect excess fat breast cancer prognosis attribute three interrelate metabolic process affect cancer progression : alter glucose metabolism , chronic inflammation excessive cellular oxidation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design answer question dietary pattern either high low dietary carbohydrate fat availability fat loss influence metabolic hormonal process may affect breast cancer recurrence . The investigator hypothesize addition anticipate effect fat loss circulating level bioavailable sex steroid , effect excess fat breast cancer prognosis attribute three interrelate metabolic process : alter glucose metabolism ( IGF-1 , IGFBP-3 , glycated protein ) , chronic inflammation ( C-reactive protein , IL-6 , TNF-alpha ) excessive cellular oxidation ( 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine 8-isoprostane F-2 alpha ) . A 6 month intervention study involve 370 post menopausal woman treat breast cancer propose . Randomized woman , stratify resect stage , systemic adjuvant therapy body mass index ( &gt; 25 &lt; 35 Kg/m2 ) , serve either non-intervention control group follow tailor diet-physical activity program design create weekly negative energy balance equivalent 3500 kcal . The intervention group receive physical activity protocol , one two diet differ dietary pattern . The specific aim : Aim 1 . Does dietary pattern either high low available carbohydrate fat alter pattern change observe circulating factor involve glucose homeostasis , chronic inflammation , cellular oxidation , steroid hormone metabolism progressive loss body fat ? The investigator also examine observe change circulate factor related change indicator breast cancer recurrence . Aim 2 . Do circulate factor associate glucose homeostasis , chronic inflammation , cellular oxidation display pattern change response progressive fat loss circulate analytes associate sex steroid metabolism ? Analytes interest measure monthly throughout study . Aim 3 . Does dietary glycemic load affect magnitude rate fat loss ? Plasma adipokines leptin adiponectin plasma ghrelin measure provide biological determinant may help explain difference response . The work propose application provide quantitative data importance magnitude fat loss metabolic hormonal process involve cancer recurrence provide guidance effective dietary approach maximize weight loss benefit breast cancer prognosis .</detailed_description>
