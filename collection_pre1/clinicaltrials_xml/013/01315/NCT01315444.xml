	<brief_summary>Gastro esophageal reflux disease ulcer relate non-ulcer dyspepsia , attack 20 % Western population . These million patient treat continuously PPI different period , many many year . Recently , rebound acid hypersecretion recognize major clinical event cessation PPI therapy . Sustained hypergastrinemia due daily PPI therapy cause increase acid-secretory capacity appear drug stop . The transient increase blood urinary pH follow gastric secretion term alkaline tide phenomenon . Carbonic acid , form presence enzyme carbonic anhydrase , neutralize intracellular hydroxyl ion produce result luminal acid secretion . The bicarbonate generate remove cell via baso-lateral chloride bicarbonate exchanger . The investigator show several study phenomenon parallel acid secretion . Thus , stimulation acid secretion test meal increase base excess maximally 45 minute change parallel peak acid output measure gastric aspirate . The investigator hypothesize gradual step cessation PPI prevent clinical relevant event . By measure alkaline tide PPI cessation investigator may prove hypothesis .</brief_summary>
