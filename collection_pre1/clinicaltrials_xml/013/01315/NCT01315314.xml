	<brief_title>Effect Glucose Degradation Products ( GDP ) Endothelial Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>New peritoneal dialysis fluid ( PDF ) neutral pH low glucose degradation product ( GDPs ) use patient peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) . Low GDP fluid report biocompatible conventional PDF . Determination biocompatibility mainly focus local peritoneal effect ; recently , interest evaluate systemic biocompatibility fluid . In recent analysis two retrospective cohort Korean PD patient , significant survival advantage show patient treat biocompatible PDF compare patient treat conventional PDF . However , mechanism survival advantage low GPD PDF observational study difficult ass . Additionally , clear new PDFs favorably impact risk marker cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Epidemiologic study identify independent association inflammation risk cardiovascular event mortality ; association confirm patient advanced chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) .Other evidence show clinically overt vascular event precede endothelial dysfunction increase circulate marker endothelial activation , include vascular cellular adhesion molecule ( VCAM ) -1 intercellular adhesion molecule ( ICAM ) -1.Moreover , association inflammation elevate level soluble VCAM-1 ICAM-1 patient risk atherosclerosis . Elevated level soluble adhesion molecule find ESRD patient , especially patient CVD malnutrition . The investigator hypothesize conventional PDF well uremia lead local peritoneal change peritoneal neoangiogenesis fibrosis , effect relate ultrafiltration failure subsequently volume overload . In addition , direct effect GDPs and/or increase systemic level AGEs activate endothelial cell increase level vascular adhesion molecule inflammation . Both local systemic effect PDF possibly associate increased cardiovascular risk mortality PD patient . This study aim examine effect neutral pH low GDP-containing PDF systemic inflammation endothelial dysfunction incident PD patient randomize , control study .</detailed_description>
