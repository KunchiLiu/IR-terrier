	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage ( ERBD ) widely accept standard intervention relief obstructive jaundice patient unresectable malignant biliary obstruction . Although plastic stent ( PSs ) develop early , self-expandable metal stent ( SEMSs ) use widely initial choice ERBD setting , SEMSs offer longer patency.However , SEMSs become occlude patient . There limited number report management occlude SEMS various result . The aim study compare efficacy ComVi stent SEMSs uncover SEMS subsequent ERBD occlusion initial SEMSs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endoscopic placement self-expandable metallic stent ( SEMSs ) mainstay palliative measure alleviate obstructive jaundice secondary advance cholangiocarcinoma . Previous meta-analysis show significant difference stent patency cover uncovered SEMS , currently available . However , information secondary SEMS insertion still scarce , prospective trial compare efficacy secondary stenting cover uncovered SEMS management occlude metal stent malignant biliary obstruction . Previously , two small retrospective study address issue . Given absence prospective trial re-intervention occlude SEMS malignant biliary obstruction , aim prospectively compare efficacy complication rate secondary ComVi stent ( cSEMS ) uSEMS management condition .</detailed_description>
