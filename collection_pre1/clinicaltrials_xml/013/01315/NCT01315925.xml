	<detailed_description>SEIFEM 2010 : EPIDEMIOLOGICAL SURVEY ON POSSIBLE PRE-HOSPITAL RISK FACTORS FOR DEVELOPING INVASIVE FUNGAL INFECTIONS IN PATIENTS AFFECTED BY ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA Background : In two different multicenter survey conduct Italy 1988-1997 1999-2003 , ( Invasive Fungal Infections ) IFIs find frequent cause morbidity mortality patient treat conventional chemotherapy , particularly suffer acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . In general , major factor recognize influence likelihood invasive fungal infection patient 's immune status , degree organ damage ( e.g. , mucositis ) , overall microbial exposure ( i.e. , colonization , environment , prior infection ) . Since 1990s , different risk-stratification strategy evaluate order identify patient may benefit intensive prophylactic diagnostic measure . However , despite similar risk profile , subset AML patient develop IFI . One excite recent advance understand epidemiology IFIs recognition complexity host identification new host-related risk factor . Aim study identify analyze risk factor develop invasive fungal infection patient newly diagnose Acute Myeloid Leukemia , particular interest pre-hospital risk factor . Aims objective : - To identify high risk subject take advantage antifungal prophylaxis early antifungal treatment ( preemptive treatment ) . - To identify possible fungal infection source period precede diagnosis leukemia , particular relate normal activity daily life ( e.g . occupation , location type residence , consume tobacco , alcohol illicit drug others ) . - To analyze hospital-related source fungal infection , well know predispose factor ( i.e . duration severity neutropenia ) like central venous catheter , urinary catheter , comorbidities , etc . - To analyze impact prophylactic regimen adopt antifungal treatment . Design : - Prospective , multicenter , observational clinical-epidemiological study . - The study expect enroll least 500 patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia , eligible treatment eligible , within 2 year achievement statistically evaluable number case . - SEIFEM 2010 noninterventional registry therefore change physician ' diagnostic therapeutic choice , remain related local guideline . - Every patient accept take part study , ask read sign inform consent . - An apposite form , detailed epidemiological section , compile clinician enrol patient . - A complete information page study supply patient enrol . Data collection : In questionnaire , possible risk factor invasive fungal infection , prior onset acute leukemia , evaluate . The module consist several section : - Personal information ( age , sex , observation time case , AML subtype , performance status admission ) , patient data anonymous . - Comorbidities ( diabetes , chronic renal failure , COPD , chronic liver disease , previous TBC ) - A section compile patient possible risk factor related daily living habit ( location type residence , profession , hobby , pet , personal hygiene , ambiental exposure , consume tobacco , alcohol illicit drug others ) - A second part form compile time evaluation induction chemotherapy ( 30 40 day chemotherapy ) , suitable conventional treatment , 30-40 day diagnosis . At time diagnosis fungal infection data type infection , treatment course infection evaluate . Eligibility : Adult pediatric patient newly diagnose acute myeloid leukemia , eligible eligible intensive chemotherapy . Since noninterventional study , therapeutic strategy remain related local guideline . Will treat case patient acute leukemia first induction develop Invasive Fungal Infection accord international EORTC criterion possible/probable/proven infection . Patients develop infection use control group . Participating center : Forty-three Italian division Hematology take part study , distribute among university highly specialized hospital locate throughout country .</detailed_description>
