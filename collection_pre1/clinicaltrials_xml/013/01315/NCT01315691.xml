	<brief_summary>A major factor respiratory health Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) subject prevalence chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection . The Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection rate CF patient increase age age 18 year approximately 85 % CF patient US infect . Liposomal amikacin inhalation ( Arikace™ ) develop possible treatment chronic infection due Pseudomonas aeruginosa CF patient . The purpose double-blind , placebo control study determine whether Arikace™ effective treating chronic lung infection cause Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cystic Fibrosis subject . The study enroll approximately 300 subject clinic US , Canada , Europe , Australia New Zealand . Subjects randomize 590 mg Arikace™ placebo receive treatment 28 day follow 56 day safety follow-up period . The subject require visit clinic 8 time ( include Screening visit ) period approximately 3 month . No overnight stay clinic require . At completion TR02-109 protocol , subject consent meet study safety criterion may enroll long-term , open-label , multi-cycle extension study 590 mg Arikace™ ( separate protocol TR02-110 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) genetic disease result mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene . Patients CF manifest pathological change variety organs express CFTR . The lung frequently affect often result chronic infection bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway inflammation . Treatment chronic lung infection one principal goal CF therapy . Arikace™ ( liposomal amikacin inhalation ) sustained-release formulation amikacin encapsulate inside nanoscale liposomal carrier design administration via inhalation . It hypothesize sustained-release pulmonary targeting biofilm penetration property formulation several advantage current therapy treat CF patient chronic lung infection cause Pseudomonas aeruginosa . This double blind , placebo control Phase 3 study design evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability Arikace™ treat CF patient chronic bronchopulmonary infection . Eligible subject randomize 1:1 receive 590 mg Arikace™ placebo daily use PARI Investigational eFlow® Nebulizer . Subjects receive 28 day treatment follow safety 56 day . Total study duration 102 day ( ~3 month ) include 18 day Screening period . Subjects evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy bi-weekly throughout study . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Arikace™ blood , sputum 24-hour urine determine subgroup study subject consent PK evaluation . At completion TR02-109 protocol , subject consent meet study safety criterion may enroll long-term , open-label , multi-cycle extension study 590 mg Arikace™ ( separate protocol TR02-110 ) .</detailed_description>
