	<brief_summary>A major factor respiratory health Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) subject prevalence chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection . The Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection rate CF patient increase age age 18 year approximately 85 % CF patient US infect . Liposomal amikacin inhalation ( Arikayce™ ) develop possible treatment chronic infection due Pseudomonas aeruginosa CF patient . The purpose European Registration study determine whether Arikayce™ effective treating chronic lung infection cause Pseudomonas aeruginosa Cystic Fibrosis subject . The effectiveness , safety tolerability Arikayce™ compare TOBI , inhalation antibiotic already available use . The study enroll approximately 300 subject clinic Europe Canada . Subjects require visit clinic 9 time ( include Screening visit ) period approximately 6 month . No overnight stay clinic require .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Arikayce™ CF Patients With Chronic Pseudomonas Aeruginosa Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) genetic disease result mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) gene . Patients CF manifest pathological change variety organs express CFTR . The lung frequently affect often result chronic infection bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa airway inflammation . Treatment chronic lung infection one principal goal CF therapy . Arikayce™ ( liposomal amikacin inhalation ) sustained-release formulation amikacin encapsulate inside nanoscale liposomal carrier design administration via inhalation . It hypothesize sustained-release pulmonary targeting biofilm penetration property formulation several advantage current therapy treat CF patient chronic lung infection cause Pseudomonas aeruginosa . This Phase 3 European Registration study design evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability Arikayce™ treat CF patient chronic bronchopulmonary infection compare currently available antibiotic , TOBI® ( tobramycin ) Inhalation Solution . Eligible subject randomize 1:1 receive 590 mg Arikayce™ daily via PARI Investigational eFlow® Nebulizer 300 mg TOBI® BID via PARI LC® PLUS nebulizer . Subjects receive 3 cycle treatment cycle comprise 28 day treatment follow 28 day off-treatment . Total study duration 186 day ( ~6 month ) include 18 day Screening period . Subjects evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy bi-weekly first 4 week treatment , thereafter every 4 week duration study . Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Arikayce™ blood , sputum 24-hour urine determine subgroup study subject consent PK evaluation . At completion TR02-108 protocol , subject consent meet study safety criterion may enroll long-term , open-label , multi-cycle extension study 590 mg Arikayce™ ( separate protocol TR02-110 ) .</detailed_description>
