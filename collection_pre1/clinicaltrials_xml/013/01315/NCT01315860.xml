	<brief_summary>Low back posterior pelvic pain common pregnant female . Previous study demonstrate disability estimate woman experience degree musculoskeletal discomfort pregnancy . Borg-Stein et . al . find 25 % pregnant female temporarily disable symptom . There demonstrated controversy mechanism low back pain pregnancy . The biomechanical theory implies enlarge uterus cause maternal center gravity move anteriorly cause stress low back . Jensen et . al . demonstrate weight gain correlate biomechanical change . The change measure weight gain segmental region body principal moment inertia sit stand movement . Literature demonstrate specific correlation weight gain biomechanical change sway rate , lumbosacral angle center gravity . These three measurement may correlate effect underlie cause low back pain pregnant woman . This study aim determine correlation weight gain pregnant females biomechanical change sway rate , lumbosacral angle center gravity . The change weight last two trimester correlate sway rate , lumbosacral angle center gravity . The degree symptomatic low back pain measure Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale also correlate sway rate , lumbosacral angle center gravity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The principal investigator recruit subject yoga studio one investigator research assistant recruit subject NSU clinic . Potential subject go short verbal pre-screening ensure fit inclusion exclusion criterion . Subjects fit criterion read sign consent form . The PI research assistant answer question study prior subject give consent . Then subject 's initial weight measure postural scale document . Change weight dependent variable study . The following independent variable measure : lumbosacral angle , sway rate shift weight posteriorly . The lumbosacral angle measure digital inclinometer . The lumbosacral angle measure plane superior surface S1 horizontal plane . Saur et . al. , demonstrate inclinometer technique lumbosacral angle establish validity reliability comparison radiographic x-ray . Comparison radiographic inclinometer technique clinically suitable measure lumbar position . Keeley et . al . report high correlation coefficient interrater reliability inclinometer technique patient chronic low back pain . The additional measurement sway rate center gravity measure postural analyzer . The quadruple scale use study base four digital force plate computer communication operate software enable test analysis . The quadruple scale provide numeric graphic data total weight , weight distribution ( kg . lb . ) , percentage weight difference , sway rate estimate location deviation subject 's center mass . All data record save . Following measurement , subject ask complete Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale . The Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale suitable questionnaire English-speaking population enquire area function specifically relevant low back pain sufferer , lift , walk , sit , stand , sleep socializing . Fisher et . al . demonstrate Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale acceptable instrument back pain patient evidence criterion-related validity , factorial validity moderately high internal consistency . It good face validity patient . According Fisher et . al. , Oswestry Scale recommend relevant measure disability evidence validity , reliability sensitivity change clinical research purpose . The total amount time need complete measurement Oswestry Low Back Pain Scale take 15 minute . Biweekly , willing participant recruit previous participant continually measure weight , lumbosacral angle , sway rate deviation subject 's center mass .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pregnant patient second third trimester patient NSU Ob/Gyn clinic prenatal yoga student Red Pearl Yoga Studio willing participate study follow measurement three month . Exclusion criterion include woman BMI 30 clinically obese . Abdominal obesity cause low back pain increase lumbosacral angle . Women exclude prior history back surgery , acute disc herniation , arthritis , immunological disorder , acute fracture osteoporosis . Additional exclusion criterion include high risk pregnancy gestational diabetes , preeclampsia , placenta previa abruptio placenta . All follow could contributory low back pain may affect biomechanics low back . If patient NSU clinic exclusion criterion document medical chart , approach recruitment study . During verbal prescreening , research assistant ask subject condition . If , eligible participate study . The verbal prescreening use yoga studio recruitment . No data collect subject exclude prescreening .</criteria>
