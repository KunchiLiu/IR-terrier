	<brief_summary>Aim study determine optimal time initiate anti-retroviral therapy HIV/TB co-infected patient recently start treatment Tuberculosis compare immediate versus defer initiation HAART . The study address follow question ; - Is possible reduce mortality rate increase survival early initiation HAART TB treatment compromise adverse drug reaction , toxicity immune reconstitution syndrome ? - What risk/ benefit ratio immediate versus defer initiation HAART TB treatment respect safety/efficacy TB HIV co-treatment ? - When appropriate time start HAART TB treatment ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study intend determine optimal time start ART compare three treatment strategy ART initiation HIV/TB co-infected patient . Four hundred fifty newly diagnose HIV infect patient active TB CD4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm3 prospectively recruit assigned randomly parallel one three treatment group ( n=150 group ) HAART start different time point describe extensive counseling adherence support . - Arm-A ( Immediate Treatment Group ) : Receipt antiretroviral therapy one week start anti-TB treatment . - Arm-B ( Deferred Treatment Group-1 ) : Antiretroviral therapy initiate 4th week start anti-TB treatment ( middle intensive phase TB treatment ) . - Arm-C ( Deferred Treatment Group-2 ) : Antiretroviral therapy initiate 8th week start anti-TB treatment ( completion intensive phase TB treatment ) . Study Design : Interventional , prospective , randomize , open-label three-armed trial placebo , Active control , parallel assignment , safety efficacy study . Study population : Previously untreated HIV-infected adult patient TB CD4 cell count &lt; 200/mm3 time TB diagnosis . Expected Total Enrollment = 450 Treatment : Patients receive first-line preferred regimen patient TB HIV coinfection ( rifampicin contain short course TB treatment efavirenz-containing HAART regimen . The intensive phase anti-TB therapy consist 2 month treatment Rifampicin , Isoniazid , Pyrazinamide Ethambutol follow continuation phase Isoniazid Rifampicin daily 4 month Directly Observed Therapy ( DOTS ) . After initiation TB treatment , patient Arm-A , Arm-B Arm-C start EFV-containing HAART regimen ( efavirenz + Lamivudine ( 3TC ) + Stavudine ( d4T ) one week , middle ( 4th week ) end ( 8th week ) intensive phase TB treatment respectively . Primar prophylaxis cotrimoxazole offer patient .</detailed_description>
