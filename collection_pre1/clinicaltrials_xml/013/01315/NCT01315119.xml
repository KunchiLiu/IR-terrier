	<brief_title>SPY Intra-Operative Angiography &amp; Skin Perfusion Immediate Breast Reconstruction w/ Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common malignancy among woman , 180,000 woman diagnose disease 2008 . Last year , 57,000 breast reconstructive procedure perform , prosthetic reconstruction constitute 76 % . Immediate reconstruction favor delayed procedure psychological technical reason . However , immediate breast reconstruction associate significantly high complication rate ( 50-52 % ) delayed procedure ( 32-36 % ) , especially prosthetic technique use . For prosthetic reconstruction , significant early complication include necrosis mastectomy skin flap , infection , delay wound heal exposure implant . The publish incidence complication range 10 % 40 % predominantly associate malperfusion mastectomy skin flap . Thus , evaluation skin perfusion elimination poorly vascularize area could help reduce high rate complication immediate breast reconstruction .</detailed_description>
