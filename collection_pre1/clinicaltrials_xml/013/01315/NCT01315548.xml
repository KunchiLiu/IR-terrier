	<brief_title>Contrast Enhanced Harmonic Endoscopic Ultrasound ( CEH-EUS ) Focal Pancreatic Masses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound contrast agent conjunction contrast specific image technique increasingly accept clinical use diagnostic imaging . The study pancreas new promising application contrast-enhanced ultrasound ( CE-US ) , include contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound ( CE-EUS ) . The technique indicate improve detection pancreatic lesion , improve delineation differential diagnosis pancreatic lesion . One fluoro-gas-containing contrast agent use CE-US CE-EUS Sonovue® , consist phospholipids-stabilized bubble sulfurhexafluoride ( SF6 ) . Sonovue® isotonic , stable resistant pressure , viscosity similar blood . It diffuse extravascular compartment remain within blood vessel gas dissolve eliminate expired air ( blood pool contrast agent ) . The safety profile SonoVue show low incidence side effect ; nephrotoxic incidence severe hypersensitivity similar magnetic resonance image contrast agent . Moreover , Sono-Vue approve clinical use EU country . The blood supply pancreas entirely arterial , make contrast-enhanced examination feasible readily available . Based European Federation Societies Ultrasound Medicine Biology guideline recommendation , updated 2008 , two phase define CE-US CE-EUS pancreas : early/arterial phase ( start 10 30 second ) venous/late phase ( 30 120 second ) . Distinguishing pancreatic adenocarcinoma pancreatic mass remain challenge current image technique . The specificity discrimination benign malignant focal pancreatic lesion find 93.3 % use power Doppler contrast-enhanced EUS ( PD-CE-EUS ) compare 83.3 % conventional EUS . The hypovascular aspect lesion PD-CE-EUS seem highly sensitive specific ( high 90 % ) adenocarcinoma several publish study . During PD-CE-EUS examination ultrasound frequency return transducer transmit , method associate artifact result turbulent flow ( flash overpainting ) . At CE-EUS , ductal adenocarcinoma typically hypoenhanced compare adjacent pancreatic tissue phase . Furthermore , lesion size margin well visualize , well relationship peripancreatic artery vein . Focal lesion chronic pancreatitis report similar hyper enhancement feature compare normal pancreatic parenchyma . Dedicated contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS technique ( base low mechanical index ) recently available new EUS system . The harmonic frequency return CEH-EUS different transmit transducer result non-linear oscillation microbubbles . The image obtain addition signal create distortion microbubbles tissue-derived signal . This optimized use low MI , allow minimum bubble destruction complete `` subtraction '' tissue derive signal , obtain high resolution continuous real-time assessment microvascularization contrast uptake period ( real-time perfusion image ) . CEH-EUS allows precise location vascular structure within parenchyma focal abnormality , good delineation pancreatic lesion EUS , especially case air fat cause artifacts insufficient visualization pancreatic parenchyma . An initial pilot study describe experimental technique CEH-EUS base linear prototype EUS scope , low mechanical index ( 0.08 - 0.25 ) 2nd generation contrast agent ( Sono-Vue ) , allow visualization early arterial phase late parenchymal phase enhancement pancreas . Another pilot study demonstrate real-time continuous image finely branch vessel pancreas intermittent homogenous parenchymal perfusion image , use radial prototype EUS scope , low mechanical index ( 0.4 ) 2nd generation contrast agent ( Sono-Vue ) . Several research group already report feasibility CEH-EUS low mechanical index . The sensitivity , specificity accuracy diagnose pancreatic adenocarcinoma 88 % , 89 % , 88.5 % one study 80 % , 91.7 % , 86 % study . However , data still limit prospective , multicentric blind study would certainly necessary . The study design prospective , blind multi-center , compare contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound ( CEH-EUS ) result detection characterization focal pancreatic mass , comparison gold standard represent pathology . The study perform approval institutional board review center . The study protocol upload ClinicalTrials.gov , registry federally privately support clinical trial conduct United States around world . The study already approve ethical committee University Medicine Pharmacy Craiova , Romania ( attach ) . According EFSUMB ( European Federation Societies Ultrasound Medicine Biology ) guideline publish 2008 , second-generation contrast agent also approve E.U . ultrasound examination , include liver pancreas examination . All patient suspicion ( clinical , US , CT/MR ) pancreatic mass undergo EUS , contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS EUS-elastography , well EUS-FNA EUS EUS-guided FNA - Protocol EUS EUS-FNA include linear EUS instrument complete examination pancreas . - Tumor characteristic ( echogenicity , echostructure , size ) describe well presence / absence power Doppler signal . - EUS-FNA performed pancreatic mass least three pass - All examiner blind result pathology CEH-EUS procedure - A two panel image usual conventional gray-scale B-mode EUS image right side contrast harmonic image leave side use , accord pre-established presets . - A low mechanical index procedure ( dynamic wide-band contrast harmonic image mode ) use , mechanical index 0.08-0.25 corresponding power . - The start point timer consider moment intravenous contrast injection ( Sonovue 4.8 mL ) . - CEH-EUS perform usual EUS examination , whole movie ( T0-T120s ) record embed HDD ultrasound system , later analysis . - In order minimize human bias , post-processing computer analysis digital movie perform within coordinate IT Center , programmer statistician blind clinical , image pathological data . EUS-elastography procedure - An additional EUS elastography movie 30 second save embedded HDD . - The following setting use EUS elastography : examination frequency usually set 7.5 MHz , preinstalled system setting use patient : reject ( 2 ) , E-smoothing ( 2 ) , persistence ( 3 ) , E-dynamic range ( 4 ) . Final diagnosis The diagnosis chronic pancreatitis base clinical information ( history alcohol abuse , previous diagnosis chronic pancreatitis diabetes mellitus ) , well combination image method ( ultrasound , CT EUS ) . At least four criterion chronic pancreatitis EUS consider positive diagnosis . The diagnosis chronic pseudotumoral pancreatitis always confirm surgery follow-up least six month use exclude malignancy patient operate . A positive cytological diagnosis take final proof malignancy pancreas mass . The diagnosis obtain EUS-FNA verify either surgery clinical follow-up least 6 month . Pathology sample obtain duodeno-pancreatectomies caudal pancreatectomy do curative intent , well microhistological fragment obtain EUS-FNA biopsy process paraffin embed usual coloration ( haematoxylin-eosin ) , subsequent immune-histochemistry discretion participate center pathologist order exclude neuroendocrine tumor / pancreatic metastasis . The patient followed-up least six month clinical examination , biological exam transabdominal ultrasound , eventually repeat spiral CT / EUS six month . Statistical analysis All result express mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Differences patient pancreatic cancer chronic pancreatitis perform two-sample t-test ( two independent sample ) . Since parametric method make assumption normality similar variance , initially perform Kolmogorov-Smirnov Shapiro-Wilk W normality test verify equality variance assumption F test . In case two-sample t-test , also perform non-parametric alternative give Mann-Whitney U test , since instance may even offer great power reject null hypothesis t-test . Since two group observation far well use single analysis enable u look data time , also perform one-way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) method baseline assumption . A p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value accuracy CEH-EUS +/- determine comparison final diagnosis . The estimated number patient include least 210 , base least 10 center least 20 patient , enrol 18 month period . The power analysis base follow assumption : order use powerful t-test independent sample , sample size equal 105 patient group sufficient provide 95 % statistical power detect difference 5 % mean , type I error alpha = 0.05 , population standard deviation = 10 % . The difference mean base previously publish data report accuracy approximately 80-85 % EUS-FNA , 90 % contrast-enhanced EUS .</detailed_description>
