This study aim determinate facial mimicry disorder PD ( Parkinson 's disease ) patient emotional facial expression ( EFE ) recognition impairment , compare healthy control subject . We also want know facial mimicry disorder primary ( subtend facial mobility impairment , say amimia ) secondary ( related mirror neuron system allow u activate similar neural network observe feel specific emotion )</brief_summary>
