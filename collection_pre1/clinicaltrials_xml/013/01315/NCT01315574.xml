	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare efficacy FDA-approved Travoprost ( Travatan Z ) Latanoprost ( Xalatan ) anti-glaucoma treatment . Several study indicate glaucoma medication may associate decreased tear production tear film break-up time ( TBUT ) , increase inflammatory cell conjunctiva ( membrane line eye lid cover eye ) lead dry eye . Normal tear film ( coat eye ) continuous blink maintains tear film continuity . If keep eye open long enough without blink , tear film start break . Your eye feel uncomfortable force blink . In patient dry eye , tear film unstable , breaks faster . Therefore tear break time patient dry eye shorter . In study , investigator compare two previously mention FDA-approved eye drop Latanoprost Travoprost . The difference two medication preservative call benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) . Latanoprost contain BAK Travoprost . The investigator compare efficacy medication lower IOP well try track density immune cell across corneal surface take photo eye . The investigator also assess whether either drop lead symptom dry eye compare result ocular surface exam test TBUT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare early effect two anti-glaucoma eye drop eye pressure inflammation eye use microscope . One eye drop contain commonly use preservative , benzalkonium chloride ( BAK ) , free preservative , instead utilise new ionic buffer system call SofZia . Prolonged use BAK may damage eye surface thus investigate microscopic level study . Specific aim assess vivo effect topical BAK-containing BAK-free prostaglandin analogue anti-glaucoma therapy intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , well density morphology corneal immune cell , epithelial cell sub-basal nerve plexus .</detailed_description>
