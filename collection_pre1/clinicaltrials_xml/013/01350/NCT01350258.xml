	<brief_summary>This research study involve treatment patient hematological cancer allogeneic ( cell donor ) hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) . HSCT often refer bone marrow transplant . Patients expect long term survival conventional therapy undergo HSCT curative therapy receive front line therapy disease . This project base HSCT approach use TJU since 2006 goal optimize type treatment . In new study , investigator substitute chemotherapy agent , Melphalan ( Mel ) , cyclophosphamide ( CY ) . Cyclophosphamide use original trial . The research question whether side effect less use Mel donor T cell make tolerant recipient use Mel . The propose study also specific term performance status organ function entry criterion . The investigator observe original trial patient poor performance upon admission transplant good outcome . Because many old patient treat accord type transplant , chemotherapy radiation use less intensive type transplant . The name transplant field reduce intensity hematopoietic stem cell transplant . The abbreviation use document RIC reduce intensity conditioning , HSCT refers transplant , MEL refers drug , Melphalan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bone Marrow Transplant Using Reduced Intensity Regimen That Given Two Steps</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Twenty-nine patient Thomas Jefferson University ( TJU ) Blood Marrow Transplantation Program treat research protocol , A Two Step Approach To Reduced Intensity Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Hematologic Malignancies HLA Partially-Matched Related Donors ( TJU 2 Step RIC , TJU IRB # 06U.328 ) July , 2010 . While treatment protocol result durable response many old patient young , heavily pretreated patient hematological malignancy , poor performance status time transplant morbidity relate cyclophosphamide ( CY ) administration regimen contribute decreased survival . In addition , disease relapse hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) major cause mortality patient disease time transplant . The objective research improve patient outcomes treatment TJU 2 Step RIC protocol refine approach base outcomes observed initial trial . More thorough assessment performance status prior HSCT substitution alkylating agent Melphalan ( MEL ) CY decrease CY-related toxicity strengthen anti-leukemic intensity regimen patient poor-risk disease major strategy use increase efficacy regimen . MEL show efficacy myeloid malignancy use condition RIC HSCT . Patients AML MDS common group treat initial TJU 2 Step RIC trial also comprise large patient group treat TJU Medical Oncology Program .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Any patient highrisk hematologic oncologic diagnosis allogeneic HSCT think beneficial , frontline therapy already apply . High risk define : Acute leukemia 3rd great CR persistent disease Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) RA RARS subtypes . Hodgkin 's NonHodgkin 's lymphoma 3rd great remission persistent disease . Myeloma 3rd great remission less PR recent therapy . Chronic myelogenous ( myeloid ) leukemia ( CML ) resistant STI therapy 2 . Patients must relate donor least 4 antigen match HLAA ; B ; C ; DR locus . 3 . Patients must adequate organ function : LVEF &gt; = 50 % DLCO &gt; = 50 % predict correct hemoglobin Adequate liver function define serum bilirubin &lt; = 1.8 , AST ALT &lt; = 2.5X upper limit normal GFR &gt; = 60 mL/min/1.73m2 4 .
