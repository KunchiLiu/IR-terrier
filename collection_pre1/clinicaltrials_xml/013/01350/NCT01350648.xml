	<brief_summary>Background : - Hepatitis B hepatitis C cause liver damage . They also cause serious illness , include liver cancer , even death . This study follow people hepatitis B hepatitis C. The purpose understand virus affect immune system long term ( 10 year ) . The study also compare virus affect people HIV , virus cause AIDS . Objectives : - To long-term study hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . - To study effect hepatitis B hepatitis C infection people HIV . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age hepatitis B hepatitis C regular doctor medical care . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Those regular doctor provide medical care study able take part . - Participants yearly visit study researcher 10 year . These test do visit . - Medical history physical exam . - Questionnaire ( optional ) emotion , sexual behavior , use alcohol drug , quality life . - Blood urine test , include HIV testing . - Tissue sample collection liver tissue biopsy . - Participants may leave study time . They receive standard care regular doctor throughout study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Study Liver Disease People With Hepatitis B and/or Hepatitis C With Without HIV Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis major health problem hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) affect upwards 350 million people worldwide one million United States , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infect many 70-130 million people worldwide , approximately 4.1 million ( 1.6 % US population ) United States . HBV HCV transmit sexually , perinatally percutaneously , although virus differ infectivity rate depend mode transmission . The immunosuppressed population , especially HIV infection , remain particular risk give common route transmission . The incidence hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) increase US worldwide , high rate cirrhotic , 10th common cause death US . The prevalence rate HIV Washington DC likely 3 % . HIV-hepatitis coinfection problematic HIV patient currently live longer highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) often die complication liver disease , include HCC . Those coinfected HBV and/or HCV progress rapidly cirrhosis hepatic failure . Treatment chronic HBV HCV limit , even inadequate , especially HIV HCV coinfection . Further research epidemiology , optimal screen new therapeutic approach HCC need . The primary objective propose study characterize viral liver disease factor affect natural history viral liver disease person without HIV emphasis live Washington DC metropolitan area . There longitudinal research cohorts participant viral hepatitis HIV coinfection , especially integrated medical care center . The study , include participant questionnaire HCV infect participant phlebotomy , administer on-site clinical facility District Columbia National Institutes Health . The cohort design study research question respect liver disease , disease pathogenesis use genomics , proteomics , immunologic disease model . Secondary objective include study immunopathogenesis HBV HCV disease progression HIV infect subject . In addition , invaluable opportunity determine prevalence risk factor associate development hepatocellular carcinoma , longterm effect HCV clearance DAAs , along biomarker profile ( ) diagnosis outcome . Moreover , serve catchment protocol select appropriate participant novel HBV HCV therapeutic trial . The integrated clinic provide optimal environment adherence engagement medical care education decrease transmission risk infection . The study establish blood specimen repository participant include research database use prospectively test future hypothesis .</detailed_description>
