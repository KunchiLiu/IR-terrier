	<brief_summary>When shallow tubewells replace highly contaminate surface water primary source drinking water Bangladesh late 20th century , contemporary study demonstrate reduction diarrheal disease improvement water source . This lack improvement transition tubewells consistent lack significant health gain observe intervention study focus water quality improvement source . In contrast , high quality intervention study improve water quality point use treatment water household show 39 % reduction diarrhea . The primary objective study within typical set rural Bangladesh household use shallow tubewell water drinking . The investigator randomly assign 1800 household child age six month two year one three group . Group 1 receive safe water storage vessel lid narrow mouth/tap Aquatabs , effervescent water purification tablet utilizes sodium dichloroisocyanurate ( NaDCC ) chlorine donor . Group 2 receive safe water storage vessel lid narrow mouth/tap . Group 3 receive water intervention continue standard habit practice . Every month field research assistant visit participate household collect information prevalence diarrhea among child age six month two year , well child age two five year present household . Diarrhea prevalence 48 hour 7 day precede visit record . The investigator compare longitudinal prevalence diarrhea follow group : ( 1 ) household receive chlorine storage container versus household receive storage container assess effect chlorination , ( 2 ) household receive storage container versus household receive intervention ass effect safe storage , ( 3 ) household receive chlorine storage container versus household receive intervention ass combine effect chlorination safe storage . Hypothesis : Drinking water shallow tubewells intermittently contaminate enteric pathogen contribute importantly diarrhea among child rural Bangladesh .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Health Impact Treating Safely Storing Shallow Tubewell Drinking Water</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Setting : The investigator conduct study Fulbaria upazila Mymensingh district , groundwater chemistry proven amenable disinfection chlorine . Groundwater many area Bangladesh rich iron ion react chlorine limit capacity provide adequate disinfection . Groundwater test Fulbaria show chlorination work effectively location , discuss . Develop Intervention : This efficacy study , i.e . try answer question : tubewell water effectively chlorinate and/or safely store home , would impact childhood diarrhea . To efficiently answer question , investigator strive optimize use intervention household randomize receive intervention . Chlorinating water show effective way disinfect water home ( Arnold Colford , 2007 ) . The investigator use Aquatabs chlorination , effervescent water purification tablet utilize sodium dichloroisocyanurate ( NaDCC ) chlorine donor . NaDCC judge safe appropriate treatment water World Health Organization ( Clasen Edmondson , 2006 ) test find acceptable community urban resident Dhaka , Bangladesh ( Clasen et al. , 2007a ) . Aquatabs also easy store , handle correctly dose liquid form chlorine ( Clasen Edmondson , 2006 ) . Groundwater Testing : To optimize use Aquatabs determine appropriate dose assign study participant , investigator collect water sample 52 shallow tubewells geographically spread 13 union Fulbaria . Water collect 5L 10L jerry can narrow mouth lid . One Aquatabs tablet add vessel , result free chlorine dose 2 mg/L 10L container 4 mg/L 5L container . Remaining chlorine residual vessel measure half hour 24 hour addition tablet ass whether meet target criterion minimum residual 0.2 mg/L 24 hour ( ensure adequate disinfection ) maximum residual 2 mg/L half hour ( minimize taste odor concern ) . It note 2 mg/L taste/odor threshold investigator target well WHO health limit 5 mg/L . Based test result , investigator determine use one Aquatabs 10L jerry provide optimal chlorine dose Fulbaria . Intervention Groups : The study follow three arm , allow u establish respective role household water treatment safe water storage prevent diarrheal illness child rural Bangladesh setting . Group 1 - Aquatabs Safe Storage Vessel : Households group receive Aquatabs water purification , safe water storage container prevent contamination storage home , train encouragement treat safely store water use provide product . Group 2 - Safe Storage Vessel : Households group receive safe water storage container , train encouragement safely store water use provide product . If study show treatment tubewell water household level effective protect child 's health , receive six-month supply water treatment tablet end study . Group 3 - Standard Practices : Households group receive water treatment storage intervention study . They continue usual water collection storage practice . If study show treatment safe storage tubewell water household level effective protect child 's health , receive safe water storage container Groups 1 2 well six-month supply water treatment tablet end study . Selection Households : Households participate study recruit systematic sample subset village Fulbaria select base field factor ease transport proximity field office . The inclusion criterion include ( 1 ) use shallow tubewell free iron complaint bari 's primary source drinking water ( 2 ) child age six month two year live bari . The primary caregiver household child target range recruit study . If multiple household bari child age six month two year , one household randomly select primary caregiver select household recruit . Recruited household randomize one three study arm block randomization randomly generate , pre-established sequence determine intervention allocate household . Promotion Interventions : The intervention continue five month . At first visit household , Groups 1 2 provide plastic water storage container lid narrow mouth/tap , Group 1 also give one-month supply tablet . Households teach demonstration flipchart illustration use tablet well properly use clean safe storage container , encourage use regularly . They also give instruction sheet illustration leave visible spot household serve reminder clean container applicable add water treatment tablet . A field research assistant part evaluation team visit household per month encourage regular water treatment safe storage , replenish supply tablet address issue maintenance clean safe storage vessel . The rest protocol write assume household receive monthly promotion visit . However , pilot study show frequent , intensive promotion lead significantly well uptake , full-scale study investigator consider replace monthly promotion frequency frequent promotion visit . Data Collection : There one baseline visit five follow-up visit participate household . Baseline Visit : The investigator conduct baseline survey include demographic , household description , socioeconomic status , pre-intervention water , sanitation hygiene habit baseline level diarrhea child age six month two year . If child recruit household age two five , investigator collect diarrhea data well allow comparison result findings literature focus child age five . During baseline visit , investigator assess microbial quality tubewell store water study household use hydrogen sulphide ( H2S ) test . Tubewell store water sample subset 150 household ( 50 study arm ) analyze total coliforms E. coli use membrane filtration . Follow-Up Visits : Every month field research assistant visit participate household conduct follow-up survey collect information prevalence diarrhea among child age six month five year 48 hour well 7 day precede visit . The investigator use 48-hour recall typically provide valid estimate longer recall period lead under-reporting health outcome ( Alam et al. , 1989 , Ramakrishnan et al. , 1999 , Feikin et al. , 2010 ) . The investigator also use 7-day recall recent finding indicate long recall period lead minimal bias term accuracy recall result significant gain statistical power ( Arnold et al. , unpublished data ) . The investigator visit household every month , frequent visit provide little additional statistical power due correlation repeat measure individual ( Schmidt et al. , 2007 ) . At visit , investigator also collect information user compliance intervention ask type timing water treatment practice , count number remain tablet inspect water storage facility , well ask participant clean storage container . The investigator also collect water sample tubewell storage container household assess microbial quality water , explore extent contamination source versus home gauge effectiveness intervention prevent contamination . The investigator perform H2S test half study household total coliform/E.coli test membrane filtration subset 150 household ( 50 study arm ) . Moreover , household Aquatabs group , investigator analyze stored water sample residual chlorine concentration monitor compliance intervention . Laboratory Testing : Water sample place ice transport Fulbaria field office appropriate test conduct field microbiologist . All test perform promptly upon transport sample field office . The hydrogen sulfide ( H2S ) test simple low-cost test ( Sobsey Pfaender , 2003 ) . Twenty ml water add H2S bottle incubate room temperature 24-48 hour . If colour water change black , indicate water contaminate coliform indicate water unfit human consumption . For membrane filtration , collected water sample quantitatively test total coliforms E. coli use DelAgua kit MI Broth ( Whatman Inc , New Jersey , USA ) . For residual chlorine testing , investigator use n , n-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine ( DPD ) colorimetric method part DelAgua kit .</detailed_description>
