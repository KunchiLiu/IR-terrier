	<brief_summary>The treatment Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC ) Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis ( PVTT ) still controversial , universally agree protocol treatment . Transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) become popular palliative treatment patient unresectable HCC , longer consider contraindication HCC PVTT . Unfortunately , long term outcome generally poor HCC treat TACE , especially HCC PVTT . HR remain therapeutic option may still offer chance cure . With advance surgical technique , become feasible remove gross tumor , include PVTT extend main portal vein , safely surgery . This study aim evaluate safety efficacy HR compare TACE treat patient HCC PVTT . The investigator also aim identify patient group might benefit either treatment HR TACE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hepatic Resection Versus Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Hepatocellular Carcinoma Complicated Portal Vein Tumor Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) sixth common cancer third frequent cause cancer death worldwide . Hepatic resection ( HR ) conventional `` curative '' treatment HCC . In European Unit States Proposed Guidelines HCC , HR recommend patient preserve liver function single HCC lesion . Unfortunately , tumor multifocality , portal vein invasion , underlie advanced cirrhosis , 10 % -30 % HCCs amenable `` curative '' treatment time diagnosis . Transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) become popular palliative treatment patient unresectable HCC , longer consider contraindication HCC portal vein tumor thrombus ( PVTT ) . Unfortunately , long term outcome generally poor HCC treat TACE , especially HCC PVTT . To improve result treatment HCC PVTT , attempt make perform HR patient . HCC PVTT remain contraindication liver transplantation high rate tumor recurrence , severe shortage donor organ . HR remain therapeutic option may still offer chance cure . With advance surgical technique , become feasible remove gross tumor , include PVTT extend main portal vein , safely surgery . More HCC PVTT , previously consider unresectable , become resectable . Recent study even show favorable long-term survival outcome HR well-selected case HCC PVTT . However , survival outcome patient HCC PVTT treat HR TACE properly compare . This study aim evaluate safety efficacy HR compare TACE treat patient HCC PVTT . The investigator also aim identify patient group might benefit either treatment HR TACE .</detailed_description>
