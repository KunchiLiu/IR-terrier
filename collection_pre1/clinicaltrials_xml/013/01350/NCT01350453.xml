Use weak arm hand encourage intensive exercise . CIT available NHS lack therapist time supervision patient lack confidence motivation carry CIT alone home . This study two stage . Stage 1 . The aim part study develop web-based therapy programme ( 'LifeCIT ' ) support patient carry CIT home ( carer possible ) online therapist support . The investigator develop therapy programme work closely least 12 patient , 6 carers 6 therapist identify resolve problem . Stage 2 The investigator carry pilot trial three centre 40-60 patient discharge hospital loss arm hand function . To test LifeCIT investigator randomly allocate patient receive either LifeCIT intervention usual care . A researcher , n't know group patient allocate , measure arm hand function , record problem cause affect quality life . Tests repeat treatment ( 3 week ) 6 month later . The investigator also examine cost-effectiveness treatment ask therapists patient view .</brief_summary>
