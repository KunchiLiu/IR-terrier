	<brief_summary>To date , attempt construct effective weight loss intervention African American adolescent obesity ( AAAO ) largely fail . While effective weight loss strategy skill identify , lifestyle change require youth family learn new dietary exercise behavior repeat skill practice natural ecology family . A major barrier motivation parent adolescents engage treatment adhere behavior change recommendation . Advances science increase human motivation ( intrinsic extrinsic ) could inform intervention development minority youth obesity insufficiently apply date process intervention development . The study bring together multidisciplinary research group comprise obesity intervention researcher extensive experience adolescent health behavior change research , basic behavioral scientist experience motivation learn research communication scientist experience provider-family interaction within urban population . Basic science obesity researcher inform intervention development contribute strong background physiological correlate obesity . Finally expert area community intervention African American adolescent contribute effective transport intervention real-world setting . The overarch aim study : To refine intervention protocol preliminary study maximize adolescent parent skill , inform learn theory , use home community-based intervention in-vivo opportunity use promote practice making change dietary , exercise sedentary behavior AAAO family ( PHASE I ) ; To develop intervention protocol utilize finding basic science regard intrinsic extrinsic motivation maximize adolescent family adherence recommendation obesity-related behavior change AAAO family ( PHASE I ) ; To develop adaptive intervention use sequential multiple randomize assignment trial ( SMART design ) ( PHASE II ) ; To refine intervention include qualitative analysis interview participant family develop community participation preparation confirmatory randomize clinical trial ( PHASE III ) . There two propose hypothesis study : 1 . Families initially receive home/community delivery Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) /skills train show great weight loss course study family receive initial office-based delivery MI/skills training . 2 . Non-responders receive home/community delivery MI/skills training Contingency Management ( CM ) show great weight loss non-responders receive MI/skills train alone .</brief_summary>
