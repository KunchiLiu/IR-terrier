There exist documentation role occupational agent chronic sinus disease . This prospective study aim provide data exposure level patient undergo sinus surgery correlate subjective objective postoperative parameter . This do providing questionnaire develop department patient plan sinus surgery participate center . This questionnaire ask medical history , current sinonasal symptom , professional history recreational occupation . An extensive list occupational agent give patient ask indicate encounter work recreational activity . This follow extensive clinical investigation include nasal endoscopy . These investigation ( questionnaire clinical examination ) repeat 3 month 12 month surgery .</brief_summary>
