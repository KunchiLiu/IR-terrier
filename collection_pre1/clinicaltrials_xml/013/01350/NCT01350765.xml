	<brief_summary>The present study carry close collaboration National Program Lady Health Workers , Ministry Health program 100,000 Lady Health Workers cover 60 % rural population Pakistan . A team Lady Health Workers Traditional Birth Attendant provide care mother newborns household level . A Basic Health Unit take care non complicate referral provide injectable antibiotic neonatal sepsis . Complicated ( definition give method section ) case refer LHWs/BHUs District Headquarter Hospital function neonatal care unit . The District Health Services , Naushero Feroz , Provincial Department Health , Sindh Federal Ministry Health study collaborator , therefore , guarantee scale intervention national level . Hypothesis : In comparison basic package exist train program LHWs , enhance training LHWs TBAs early recognition management birth asphyxia , serious newborn infection LBW ( combine prompt referral ) result additional 30 % reduction neonatal mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose body work address important major determinant immediate cause neonatal mortality Pakistan . The recent DHS survey indicate three cause prematurity , birth asphyxia serious infection account approximately 85 % burden newborn death Pakistan ( PDHS 2007 ) . The recent evidence base intervention neonatal intervention clearly indicate investigator basis action several intervention make difference outcome . Several intervention clearly feasible within health system fundamental point would assurance skilled care service newborn resuscitation , basic preterm care management refer case neonatal infection within health facility ( RHCs , THQ DHQ hospital catchment district ) . However , give fact vast majority neonatal birth death still occur community setting , add value implementation relevant intervention community setting . To illustrate , figure indicate potential intervention , link pathway reduction exposure adverse outcome neonatal sepsis . Although algorithm suggests severe neonatal infection refer care facility setting , recognize situation care seek may neither possible feasible , treatment neonatal sepsis may need provided domiciliary community level ( i.e . community base clinic BHUs ) . Research question Can package community-based intervention , link strengthen health facility , reduce NMR feasibly deliver , intervention focus train TBAs &amp; LHWs link LHWs recognize provide immediate/early management newborn complication - birth asphyxia , serious newborn infection , low birth weight , tandem TBAs ? Can community-based cadre care provider improve sustain skill provision quality care newborn complication birth asphyxia , serious newborn infection , low birth weight ? Can community-based strategy train TBAs LHWs , mobilize community focus perinatal health , result improve knowledge use key newborn health practice relate prevention newborn complication birth asphyxia , serious newborn infection , complication low birth weight ? Primary Objectives : To develop implement intervention package TBAs LHWs reduce burden birth asphyxia , sepsis low birth weight asses feasibility potential scale To assess efficacy intervention package reduce cause neonatal mortality population level Secondary Objectives : To improve case recognition management birth asphyxia , sepsis LBW primary care health care provider ( public private sector Midwives , LHWs TBAs ) primary care setting . To evaluate combined effectiveness birth asphyxia , sepsis low birth weight intervention deliver TBAs LHWs cause specific neonatal mortality population level . To evaluate effectiveness use enhance intervention package enhance collaboration linkages LHWs TBAs increase LHW attendance home delivery .</detailed_description>
