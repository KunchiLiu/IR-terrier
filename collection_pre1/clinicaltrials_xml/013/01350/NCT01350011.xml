	<detailed_description>This component ground past work Center . It continue tradition work complex population new setting . However , address problem shorter ( standard traditional tobacco dependence ) intervention appear work well population , test research-based alternative show effectiveness prior research . If Innovative System ( IS ) propose show effective population , line research offer field strategy effectively address tobacco dependence among person non-nicotinic drug abuse disorder . It extend treatment , appropriate adaptation , could become continue care intervention variety health system use variety health care personnel , include pharmacist , primary care physician &amp; nurse . Drug addiction treatment patient , include treatment opioid dependence , high rate tobacco dependence , especially cigarette smoking . The propose study evaluate Innovative System ( IS ) treatment tobacco dependence one group opioid treatment patient , buprenorphine maintenance . The primary specific aim propose study test four efficacy hypothesis study cost cost effectiveness IS . We test follow four hypothesis explore one additional primary aim : 1 . We hypothesize month 12 18 , participant IS attain high biochemically verify cigarette abstinence rate STC . 2 . We hypothesize month 6 , 12 , 18 , participant IS report quit attempt stringent cigarette abstinence goal participant STC . 3 . We hypothesize , treatment condition , high number cigarette smoke baseline high baseline Fagerstr√∂m Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) score predict low probability abstinence month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 . 4 . We hypothesize , experimental condition , participant small Cotinine/3HC ( COT/3HC ) ratios likely abstinent month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , large ratio . 5 . The final primary specific aim determine cost provide innovative smoke cessation treatment opiate dependent individual buprenorphine treatment learn treatment cost-effective , , benefit sufficient justify cost . This aim reflect ongoing historical emphasis P50 center grant , obtain cost cost-effectiveness data , well efficacy data A secondary aim obtain preliminary data difference use non-nicotinic drug participant achieve abstinence cigarette study , .</detailed_description>
