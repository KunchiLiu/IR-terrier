	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether increase intake dietary fiber 12-week , low-calorie weight loss intervention affect abdominal fat change improve cardiovascular risk factor African-American woman standard weight loss intervention . The investigator test two main hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : Women high dietary fiber intervention group lose significantly abdominal fat around organ woman standard fiber group . Hypothesis 2 : Women high dietary fiber intervention group lower blood pressure , fast glucose , fast lipid inflammatory factor 3-months compare woman control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Specific Aim 1 : To test , small clinical trial 30 pre-menopausal African American woman , whether increase intake dietary fiber embed 12 week weight loss intervention reduce VAT accumulation standard weight loss intervention . Hypothesis 1 : Women high dietary fiber intervention group lose significantly VAT woman standard fiber group . Specific Aim 2 : To test , small clinical trial 30 pre-menopausal African American woman , whether increase intake dietary fiber embed 12 week weight loss intervention improve cardiovascular risk factor standard weight loss intervention . Hypothesis 2 : Women high dietary fiber intervention group lower blood pressure , fast glucose , fast lipid inflammatory factor 3-months compare woman control group . Specific Aim 3 : To characterize ability recruit retain 30 African-American , premenopausal woman 12 week weight loss intervention study Specific Aim 4 : To determine participant compliance serum measurement evaluation dietary compliance log . METHODS AND MEASURES Design : This study randomize mask controlled trial design 30 pre-menopausal African American woman age 20-50 year BMI ≥ 30 kg/ m2 waist circumference &gt; 88 cm evaluate effect fiber supplementation change abdominal fat deposition . The fiber intervention nest within 3-month weight loss trial . The placebo active intervention appear identical participant . The person know intervention ( fiber vs. placebo ) Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) ( former General Clinical Research Center ) Nutrition staff . All woman ~ 800 kcal/day calorie restriction , 12 week , design lead 0.5 kg - 0.9 kg per wk weight loss 9-18 kg lose study . Diets contain least 0.8 gram protein/kg IBW limit 15 gram total fiber . Calorie restriction occur either CRU prepare meal replacement participant institute calorie restriction learn via nutritional education session . Participants randomize start 12-week study intervention roll basis . At one time , 8 woman enrol study . The enrollment continue 30 woman start . The woman hold started group . Randomization : Although enrollment rolling , participant randomize group eight ensure capacity metabolic kitchen always maintain . The randomization one four group ( 1- intervention/feeding ; 2- intervention/nutritional education ; 3- placebo/feeding ; 4-placebo/nutritional education ) . Participants randomize one four group close baseline visit . Randomization occur via envelope . There envelope fiber intervention one caloric restriction method . The intervention envelope contain four fiber card ( mark B ) four placebo card ( mark A ) . The calorie restriction envelope contain meal replacement card ( mark D ) four nutrition education card ( mark C ) . Participants give randomization assignment CRU staff . The PI participant blind fiber intervention . Setting : This study take place two main setting , CRU participant 's home . All clinical measurement , nutritional education , meal replacement pick- distribution dietary supplement take place CRU . The CRU agree : 1 ) perform CT , RMR , anthropomorphic measure indicate screening , baseline 12-week follow-up ; 2 ) draw , process assay blood , indicate , screen , baseline 12-week follow-up ; 2 ) provide two nutritional education session , two week apart ( nutrition education group ) ; 3 ) prepare distribute lunch dinner ( meal replacement group ) ; 4 ) prepare distribute daily fiber supplement participant ; 5 ) prepare , distribute collect weekly food compliance log participant . Interventions : Dietary Fiber Intervention : Benefiber® powder use dietary supplement intervention . Benefiber® powder contain wheat dextrin , 100 % natural fiber . It 's taste-free , sugar-free , dissolve completely noncarbonated beverage soft food , wo n't thicken . Benefiber® powder mix hot cold beverage water , coffee , juice ; soft food applesauce , pudding yogurt ; cook recipe food muffin , sauce soup , without affect taste consistency . Benefiber® powder recommend carbonate beverage . Benefiber shelf life 2 year store controlled room temperature 20-25°C ( 68-77°F ) . Benefiber® Powder , contain less 20 ppm gluten therefore consider `` gluten-free , '' base FDA Codex Alimentarius Commission 's proposed definition le 20 ppm . Participants intervention arm receive 3 supplement packet consume per day . Each active dietary supplement packet contain 8 gram Benefiber® powder 3 gram TRUE® lemon flavoring , 100 % natural artificial ingredient sweetener , preservative , sodium gluten . The TRUE® Lemon product make cold-pressed crystallized lemon contain 0 calorie 0g carbohydrate . Each placebo dietary supplement packet contain 8 gram Splenda 3 gram true lemon sweetener . Each packet design add 8 oz fluid . The three packet consume day total 24 fluid ounce . Weight Loss Methods : All participant daily caloric restriction ~ 800 kcal order facilitate loss 0.5 kg - 0.9 kg per week weight loss 9-18 kg loss 12-week study period . All participant undergo rest metabolic rate determination use MedGraphics Ultima™ metabolic cart accompany Breeze software . Based caloric need determine maintain weight , new caloric plan , 800 kcal low basal need , determine . At minimum , however , woman receive 1000 kcal per day . Once caloric goal determine , achieve CRU-prepared meal replacement participant- instituted calorie restriction technique learn via nutritional education group session . Participants receive nutritional education two individual session ( space approx . 2 week apart ) . The nutritional session focus knowledge , self-regulation , motivation , experience environment . All participant weigh baseline weekly close study , week 13 . Additionally , participant , CRU-prepared meal , ask return uneaten food , record food eat part plan complete weekly food compliance log . Participants self-directed food selection nutritional education ask complete detailed record food select day . All log food record review PI CRU study dietician . If participant : 1 ) increase weight ≥ 5 pound weigh-in session ; 2 ) trend weight gain two consecutive session ; 3 ) fail return 2 consecutive food log ; flag additional nutritional counseling . OUTCOMES Study Outcomes : The primary outcome , change VAT baseline 12 week , obtain via repeat compute tomography ( CT ) scan . The secondary outcome change CVD risk factor ( blood pressure , fast lipid , insulin sensitivity , C-reactive protein ) liver attenuation . Abdominal fat mass measure L4/L5 vertebral region CT . Height weight measure near 0.5 cm 0.1 kg , respectively , BMI calculate ( kg/m2 ) . Systolic diastolic blood pressure obtain 5-minute rest ; average final two three measurement use analysis . Fasting blood sample collect measurement glucose , insulin , LDL , HDL,25-OH vitamin D , ghrelin , adiponectin , TNF-alpha , IL-6 high sensitivity C-reactive protein . Insulin resistance calculate via HOMA model . Covariates smoke status , physical activity , alcohol intake , sleep , depressive symptom ascertain baseline .</detailed_description>
