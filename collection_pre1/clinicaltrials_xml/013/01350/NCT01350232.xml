	<brief_summary>This clinical research trial novel preparatory regimen develop bone marrow transplant ( BMT ) eliminate primary obstacle transplant , lack match sibling donor . It believe regimen sufficiently efficacious sufficiently gentle apply patient sickle cell anemia related disorder . It propose characterize efficacy toxicity regimen high risk patient sickle cell anemia use criterion patient selection accept prior BMT trial patient sickle cell disease , specifically subset patient whose prior clinical behavior indicate high risk serious morbidity early mortality . In addition , propose characterize pathophysiology consistent febrile response see haploidentical BMT regimen investigator develop Thomas Jefferson University ( TJU ) . The primary goal study determine response rate reduce intensity condition regimen consist fludarabine , cytarabine , low dose total body irradiation cyclophosphamide patient severe sickle cell anemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hemoglobinopathies , sickle cell disease thalassemia major , constitute group genetic disease associate significant morbidity premature death . In 1970s , mean survival patient sickle cell disease 14.3 year . With improvement medical practice , improve estimate third decade life . In patient sickle cell disease , single amino acid substitution beta-hemoglobin cause erythrocytes sickle response oxidative stress . The sequelae defect vaso-occlusive crisis , result episode bony pain infarction , acute chest syndrome , stroke . Life long need transfusion lead complication include alloimmunization iron overload . The latter condition frequently associate significant end-organ damage . In recent year , new strategy supportive care , use hydroxyurea stimulate fetal hemoglobin production patient sickle cell anemia , result amelioration devastate manifestation disease . However , therapy benefit patient , concern possible risk latent transformation leukemia prolong use drug . Clearly , well treatment strategy need devastate group disease . Patients sickle cell anemia offer enrollment clinical trial reduce intensity stem cell transplant . The transplant donor either HLA match sibling family member 50 % match HLA . Patients receive therapy 2 step . For patient allo-immunized donor ( patient make immune response already donor 's HLA type ) , desensitization process . This outpatient therapy include therapy bortezomib 1st , 4th , 8th 11th day 21 day cycle . This repeated second cycle , total 8 dos bortezomib 6 week period . In addition , receive rituximab 1st 8th day cycle . These therapy design decrease subject 's chance rejecting transplant , know patient sickle cell anemia likely heavily immunize donor . For patient high level antibody donor , plasmapheresis procedure perform prior admission well . All patient undergo red cell exchange prior admission . During transplant admission , subject receive `` Two Step '' chemotherapy transplant regimen . The chemotherapy `` first step '' fludarabine cytarabine low dose total body irradiation . This follow `` first step '' transplant graft - donor lymphocytes . The `` second step '' chemotherapy two dos cyclophosphamide . This follow `` second step '' transplant graft - stem cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient Selection : ) Patients sickle cell disease ( sickle cell anemia , sickle cellhemoglobin C disease , sickle cellβ0thalassemia ) confirm hemoglobin electrophoresis . ii ) Patients one following : 1 . History acute chest syndrome require recurrent hospitalization exchange transfusion ( Acute chest syndrome define pulmonary infiltrate involve least one complete lung segment , consistent alveolar consolidation atelectasis , accompany chest pain , fever , cough , tachypnea wheeze ) 2 . History nonhemorrhagic stroke central nervous system event last long 24 hour 3 . Recurrent vasoocclusive pain ( ≥5 episodes past two year ) recurrent priapism require hospitalization visit emergency room sickle cell day unit 4 . Sickle nephropathy ( moderate severe proteinuria glomerular filtration rate 3050 % normal predict value ) progression ACE inhibitor therapy iii ) Patient must fail therapy hydroxyurea , HU evidence least 6 month maximum HU dosage sickle cell disease , i.e . dose escalation level cause minimal hematologic toxicity term CBC value . Failure respond must also document significant increase subject HbF level maximally tolerate dosage.AND development/ persistence item list ( ii ) Patients deem eligible hydroxyurea primary hematologist consider eligible without failed hydroxyurea . Noneligibility hydroxyurea therapy base : ( 1 ) diagnose SC disease sickle cellβ0thalassemia clear evidence support use hydroxyurea therapy thus treatment hydroxyurea consider standard care entity ( 2 ) presence high hemoglobin F level patient sickle cell anemia document Hereditary Persistence Fetal Hemoglobin ( HPFH ) hydroxyurea consider standard care ( 3 ) severe adverse reaction hydroxyurea patient sickle cell anemia base , limited , count suppression , GI intolerance , dermatomyositis Patient unwillingness compliant hydroxyurea therapy acceptable reason noneligibility iv ) Patients must acceptable related donor 1. match HLAA ; B ; C ; DR locus ( 8 8 match ) mismatch one locus ( 7 8 match ) ( well match relate donor 2. mismatch 24 allele ( haploidentical ) v ) Patient age great 18 45 year vi ) ECOG performance status 02/ Karnofsky 70100 % vii ) Written informed consent obtain patient . viii ) Transaminases &lt; 3X ULN ; patient transaminases great ULN less 3XULN evaluated hepatology service undergo image biopsy deem necessary hepatology . They consider eligible unless cleared hepatology . Patient Selection : ) Pregnancy/ unwillingness use adequate contraception study period ii ) Liver disease include 1 . Acute hepatitis ( transaminases &gt; 3x normal value ) 2 . Chronic hepatitis C 3 . Chronic hepatitis B history exposure hepatitis B iii ) Cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 50 % iv ) Pulmonary hypertension evidence finding rest echocardiogram pulmonary artery systolic pressure ≥ 40 mmHg evidence right ventricular dysfunction ( hypokinesis RV dilation ) v ) Severe renal impairment ( GFR &lt; 30 % predict normal value ) vi ) Severe residual functional neurologic impairment ( hemiplegia alone ) vii ) DLCO ≤50 viii ) Any evidence infection human immunodeficiency virus ix ) Psychiatric disorder would preclude patient sign informed consent x ) Severe neurocognitive executive function make informed consent possible</criteria>
