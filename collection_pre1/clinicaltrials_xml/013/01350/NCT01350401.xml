	<brief_title>Phase I/II Study Assess Safety Activity Enhanced TCR Transduced Autologous T Cells Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose study evaluate safety tolerability autologous genetically modify T cell . Genetic material transfer subject 's previously harvest autologous T cell redirect target melanoma cell rather usual target . Study subject must histologically cytologically melanoma stage 3/4 tumor must express HLA Class 1 allele HLA-A*0201 NY-ESO-1/LAGE . Subjects must also measureable disease study entry , define least one lesion measure least one dimension &gt; = 10mm spiral CT scan .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Patients must histologically cytologically confirm melanoma stage III/IV , unresectable Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥10 mm spiral CT scan One prior cytotoxic therapy treatment metastatic disease allow . Unlimited regimen use biological agent ( vaccine ) , immunotherapy , target agent permit . For example , BRAF inhibitor ipilimumab permit . Patients must fully recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy . Prior therapy must complete ≥28 day first dose cyclophosphamide . Age ≥18 Life expectancy great 3 month ECOG performance status ≤ 1 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl Or Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal The patient must express HLA class I allele HLAA*0201 NYESO1/LAGE . Patient must prove positive tumor sample NYESO1 determine H score immunohistochemistry stain . Positive expression define H score ≥ 100 H score = [ 2 x ( % cell 2+ ) + 3 x ( % cell 3+ ) ] . NOTE : The percentage negative weakly stain nucleus ( i.e . 1+ ) include calculation H score . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test male female ( childbearing potential ) subject must agree use reliable method contraception study . Ability patient ( legally authorize representative applicable ) understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria Patients 2 regimen contain cytotoxic chemotherapy metastatic melanoma . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients active brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition cyclophosphamide agent use study . Active infection Prior malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within 3 year . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . All patient undergo cardiac stress test evaluation cardiac function . Pregnant nursing female Active infection HIV , HBV HCV define , due immunosuppressive effect cyclophosphamide use unknown risk associate viral replication . Positive serology HIV Active Hepatitis B infection determine test hepatitis B surface antigen . Active Hepatitis C. Patients screen HCV antibody . If HCV antibody positive , screen HCV RNA RTPCR bDNA assay must perform screen local laboratory CLIA certification equivalent . Eligibility determine base negative screen value . The test require documentation negative result HCV RNA test perform within 60 day prior screen provide .</criteria>
