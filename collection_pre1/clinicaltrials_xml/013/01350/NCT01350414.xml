	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate durability effectiveness ( beyond one year ) Alair System patient severe persistent asthma . The study consist Alair-group subject currently follow-up phase ( 5 year ) AIR2 Trial ( Protocol # 04-02 , clinicaltrials.gov number NCT00231114 ) . Durability treatment effect evaluate compare proportion subject experience severe exacerbation first year Alair treatment proportion subject experience severe exacerbation subsequent 12 month period 5 year . All Alair group subject AIR2 Trial follow 5 year per AIR2 Trial protocol . The data use determine durability effectiveness describe present protocol ( Protocol # 10-01 ) collect exist AIR2 Trial protocol ( Protocol # 04-02 ) . Study Hypothesis : An empirical demonstration durability treatment effect use show proportion subject experience severe exacerbation first year compare proportion subject experience severe exacerbation subsequent year get substantially bad . The primary statistical objective demonstrate proportion subject experience severe exacerbation subsequent 12-month follow-up ( Year 2 , Year 3 , Year 4 Year 5 [ 12-month period ] ) statistically bad compare proportion first 12-months , begin 6-weeks last Alair treatment . This objective meet upper 95 % confidence limit difference proportion ( i.e. , subsequent 12-month proportion minus first 12-month proportion ) less 20 % .</brief_summary>
