	<brief_summary>One big problem face prostate cancer patient treat physician need treat . Common clinical pathological parameter useful ( PSA , Gleason score , etc . ) clearly predict benefit treatment fail . Genetic marker tumor aggressivity would great value . The find TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion associate increase risk cancer progression important . TMPRSS2 control androgen ( testosterone ) ERG part family proteins role control cell growth , cell specialization produce tumor . As consequence gene fusion , production ERG protein increase presence testosterone could key development prostate cancer , resistance treatment poor outcome . The PTEN gene know role tumor suppressor . Its deletion contribute factor development prostate cancer poor outcome . The coexistence two marker could associate high risk recurrence . To date study regard presence either two marker coexistence high risk prostate cancer patient , despite radiation therapy androgen suppression , develop biochemical failure ( PSA level rise ) . Patients participate PCS IV study ( high risk prostate cancer treat radiation therapy plus either 18 36 month hormonal suppression ) biochemical failure 3 year follow-up post hormonal therapy approach . Tumor block consent patient collect analyzed presence TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion PTEN deletion Pathology Department Jewish General Hospital . Statistical analysis carry see whether either marker present , whether associate certain clinical pathological high risk factor , whether use predict patient fail treatment .</brief_summary>
