	<brief_summary>The primary hypothesis research study patient remission undergo myeloablative haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) Thomas Jefferson University ( TJU ) 2 Step treatment regimen disease-free survival ( DFS ) rate 1 year well historical DFS patient similar diagnosis age undergo match sibling HSCT . Based review literature DFS rate 50 % well 1 year would meet criterion effective alternative therapy . A DFS rate 75 % good would imply superior efficacy TJU 2 Step approach T-replete match sibling HSCT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary rationale development research study find Thomas Jefferson University ( TJU ) 2 Step approach stem cell transplant effective treatment patient blood cancer require transplant long-term survival without available matched-sibling donor . Historically , survival rate patient undergoing half-matched stem cell transplant much low observe match sibling stem cell transplant . This may due poor-risk disease feature patient time refer hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . Survival post half-matched stem cell transplant also affect requirement remove soothe donor T cell result high rate infection relapse . Newer approach haploidentical HSCT , TJU 2 Step approach , utilize cyclophosphamide ( CY ) tolerize donor lymphocyte instead remove completely donor product . This result less infection without concomitant increase severe graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) increase overall survival compare old haploidentical treatment approach due decrease regimen-related morbidity . Because historically low overall survival ( OS ) haploidentical HSCT , become procedure last resort center unwilling consider unless option exhaust . With recent development regimens TJU 2 Step approach provide safe , alternative platform HSCT , feasible , ethically acceptable , patient without matched sibling donor undergo HSCT prior heavily pretreated develop resistant disease . In set , i.e . equivalent regimen safety profile homogenous patient comparison group , possible accurately compare antitumor effect match sibling donor haploidentical donor . There ample evidence literature HLA mismatching cause GVHD . There large body evidence support notion HLA mismatch provide superior tumor control translate great relapse free survival . As compare common type transplant donor T cell give recipient , investigator would surmise T cell tolerization associate TJU 2 Step approach may decrease anti-tumor effect donor immune system . Conversely , great degree human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) mismatch exploitation NK effect may mitigate attenuated T cell alloreactivity . Thus , context comparable regimen-related toxicity , major aim research study compare graft versus tumor effect measure disease-free survival ( DFS ) match sibling HSCT TJU 2 Step haploidentical HSCT . If DFS similar despite T cell tolerization , TJU 2 Step haploidentical approach consider effective alternative therapy patient remission without match sibling donor . The widespread benefit outcome would enfranchisement segment population without available match donor result delay failure receive potentially life-saving therapy . If DFS survival treatment TJU 2 Step haploidentical approach superior would expect matched sibling HSCT , one could conclude haploidentical HSCT confers great tumor control form basis future study regard potential benefit utilize haploidentical donor match sibling donor type donor available .</detailed_description>
