	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Advanced Progressive Malignant Pheochromocytoma Paraganglioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess anti-tumor activity ( term tumor response rate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) ( GW786034 ) patient advance malignant pheochromocytoma paragangliomas . SECONDARY OBJEC TIVES : I . To assess safety profile pazopanib . II . To assess duration tumor response . III . To assess time treatment failure . IV . To assess progression-free survival time . V. To assess overall survival time . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . For patient secretory tumor , examine change urinary catecholamine and/or metanephrine level . II . For patient secretory tumor , examine whether pazopanib-induced change urinary catecholamine and/or metanephrine level first cycle treatment may associate objective tumor response . III . To examine association tumor response somatic mutational status archive tumor , germline mutational status patient 's peripheral blood mononuclear cell , ( presence succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit D [ SDHD ] , succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit B [ SDHB ] , ret proto-oncogene [ RET ] , von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor [ VHL ] , neurofibromatosis type-1 ) . IV . To examine association tumor response tumor expression level angiogenic vascular marker include hypoxia inducible factor 1 , alpha ( HIF-1a ) , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF-R ) ( total phospho- ) microvessel density archival tumor tissue . IV . To examine whether extent tumor response/regression may correlate plasma pazopanib ( GW786034 ) concentration achieve third cycle ( first cycle run-in cycle ) pazopanib ( GW786034 ) therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 ( day 1-14 course 1 2 ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo urine blood sample collection baseline periodically study correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
