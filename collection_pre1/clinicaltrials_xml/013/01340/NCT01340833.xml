	<brief_summary>GSK2118436 orally administer , potent selective small molecule BRAF inhibitor currently develop treatment BRAF mutation-positive tumor . This open-label , non-randomized study design determine absolute bioavailability oral dose 150 mg GSK2118436 co-administered intravenous 50 microgram dose [ 14C ] GSK2118436 subject BRAF mutant solid tumor . Pharmacokinetic sample obtain 72 hour post-dose . Safety assessment perform throughout study . After complete assessment , eligible subject may transition BRF114144 , open-label , rollover study GSK2118436 continue treatment .</brief_summary>
