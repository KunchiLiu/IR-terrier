	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose TPI 287 give patient metastatic melanoma . Researchers want find TPI 287 control disease . The safety TPI 287 also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Study TPI 287 Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug TPI 287 design block tumor grow prevent cancer cell divide , may cause die . Study Groups : Patient assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 64 participant enrol Phase II . If patient enrol Phase I portion , dose TPI 287 receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose level TPI 287 . Each new group receive high start dose TPI 287 group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose TPI 287 found . If patient enrol one early dose level , experience intolerable side effect 2 study cycle , dose may increase next high dose level show safe . If patient intolerable side effect , dose may lower , pause , stop completely . This doctor . If patient enrol Phase II portion , receive TPI 287 high dose tolerate Phase I portion . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day ( +/- 3 day ) . TPI 287 give vein 1 hour , Days 1 , 8 , 15 ( +/- 2 day ) study cycle . Since TPI 287 mix well water , patient receive dos TPI 287 dissolved cremophor . Cremophor chemical create castor oil . Some participant may allergic cremophor . Before patient receives dose TPI 287 , receive dexamethasone , Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) , Pepcid ( famotidine ) vein , help prevent allergic reaction . Each medication give 10 minute . Patient also receive drug prevent nausea vomiting . The study staff tell patient drug risk . Study Visits : At study visit , patient ask symptom may drug may take . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 21 cycle , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . The blood sample Day 21 may draw clinic near patient 's home . The study staff give patient information . On Day 28 cycle : - Patient physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign . - Patient 's performance status record . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - If doctor think need , patient MRI scan brain check status disease . - If doctor think need , patient neurological exam . On Day 1 Cycle 2 every cycle ( Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , ) , patient CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . Every 8 week , patient CT MRI scan brain check status disease . If patient brain metastasis , CT MRI scan every 4 week . Length Study : Patient may continue take study drug 6 month . Treatment beyond 6 month decide patient 's doctor . Patient allow continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . Patient longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study complete end-of-treatment visit follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : About 4 week patient stop receive TPI 287 , end-of-treatment visit . At visit , follow test procedure perform : - Patient physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Patient 's performance status record . - Patient ask problem side effect may . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If patient 's doctor think need , CT MRI scan check status disease . Follow-Up : - Patient contact phone come clinic visit . The phone call last 5 minute . Patient ask problem side effect may : - Every 2 month unless disease get bad . - Then , every 3 month . These follow-ups end 3 year enrol study . This investigational study . TPI 287 FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 82 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically proven melanoma metastasis unresectable Stage III Stage IV . This include bulky stage III M13 . 2 . Patients must show unequivocal evidence tumor recurrence progression least one indicator lesion measure one dimension &gt; /= 20mm conventional technique ( CT , MRI , Xray ) &gt; /= 10mm spiral CT scan . 3 . Patients melanoma documented metastasis brain eligible : . Must asymptomatic stable disease least 2 month determine CT MRI brain time evaluation measurable change . b . May prior therapy brain metastasis whole brain irradiation , stereotactic gamma ray therapy resection brain metastasis . 4 . Patients may two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens systemic disease ( immunological target therapy e.g . vaccine , IL2 , BRAF inhibitor , consider prior cytotoxic chemotherapy ) 5 . All patient must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study keep policy hospital . 6 . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) status &lt; /= 2 . 7 . Patients must recover toxic effect prior therapy ( baseline grade ) , least 3 week last dose administer . Any question whether patient fulfill criterion direct Study Chair . 8 . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1,500/mm^3 platelet count &gt; /= 100,000/mm^3 ) , adequate liver function [ aspartate aminotransferase ( AST SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT SGPT ) &lt; /= 2.5 time normal patient without liver metastasis ALT ( SGPT ) AST ( SGOT ) &lt; /= 5 , time normal patient liver metastasis ] , serum bilirubin &lt; /= 2 mg/dl ) , adequate renal function ( BUN creatinine &gt; /= 1.5 time institutional normal ) prior start therapy 9 . As TPI 287 may interfere Coumadin dosing , patient take TPI 287 require monitoring Prothrombin Time ( PT ) , Partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) 10 . Females childbearing potential ( non childbearing define great one year postmenopausal surgically sterilize ) must use acceptable contraceptive method ( abstinence , intrauterine device , oral contraceptive double barrier device ) , must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior begin treatment trial . Sexually active men must also use acceptable contraceptive method duration time study . 11 . Patient 15 year age old 1 . 1 . Patients brain metastasis stable 2 month . 2 . Patients take primidone , carbamazepine , phenobarbital phenytoin anticonvulsant ( EnzymeInducing AntiEpileptic Drugs EIAED ) . Patients change anticonvulsant others allow must drug list least 1 week start treatment . 3 . Patients &gt; Grade 2 neuropathy 4 . Patients uncontrolled high blood pressure ( systolic BP &gt; 140 patient &lt; 50 year old &gt; 160 patient &gt; 50 and/or diastolic BP &gt; 90 patient &lt; 50 year old &gt; 99 patient 50 ) unstable angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , clinical history myocardial infarction within previous six month , serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia determine principal investigator . 5 . Because concern potential interaction TPI 287 medication take patient HIV positive AIDS related disease , patient HIV positive eligible entry study . Only patient suspect HIV test positive , ineligible . 6 . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) ineligible unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year . 7 . Patients : . Active infection associate fever last 24 hour require antibiotic b . Disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism c. Serious intercurrent medical illness The Principal investigator designee make final decision regard eligibility enrollment . 8 . Female patient pregnant breastfeed 9 . Patients young 15 year age</criteria>
