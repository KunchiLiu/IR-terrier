	<brief_summary>Abnormal lung function high exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) report asymptomatic patient asthma . The investigator aim ass whether FeNO FEF25-75 improve concurrently treatment inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) patient control asthma . Geometric mean ( GM ) FeNO spirometric value patient 8 16 year age maintain asthma control without controller medication compare healthy control patient uncontrolled asthma also receive controller medication . Patients control asthma high FeNO ( &gt; 25 ppb ) randomize ICS treatment remain untreated . Changes spirometric value GM FeNO baseline evaluate 6 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current guideline-defined asthma control apply level airway inflammation neither symptoms result basic pulmonary function test reflect ongoing airway inflammation.Consequently , asymptomatic minimally symptomatic patient usually consider control asthma even subclinical airway inflammation . Measures airway inflammation thus require identify patient silent airway inflammation manifest symptom impair lung function . In addition , measurement easy perform , reproducible , associate high degree acceptance patient . In regard , advent FeNO measurement represent significant advance monitoring airway inflammation asthmatic patient . High FeNO value certain cut-point may indicate active eosinophilic airway inflammation likelihood deterioration asthma control . However , still unclear high FeNO asymptomatic patient implies need anti-inflammatory treatment . Current guideline asthma management recommend forced expiratory volume first second ( FEV1 ) principle spirometric parameter ass airflow limitation . However , asthmatic subject air trap presence normal FEV1 . Air trap asthmatic subject demonstrate well correlate forced expiratory flow 25 % 75 % vital capacity % predict ( FEF25-75 % predict ) FEV1 % predict . In fact , impair FEF25-75 one common abnormality pulmonary function cross-sectional study asymptomatic patient . In addition , high FeNO asymptomatic minimally symptomatic patient may accompany impairment FEF25-75 parameter suggest measure residual small airway disease . Therefore , possibility improvement FEF25-75 happen concomitantly decrease FeNO anti-inflammatory treatment . In study , recruit previously well-documented atopic asthmatic child require medication maintain asthma control 3 month high FeNO level ( &gt; 25 ppb ) . We aim assess whether decrease FeNO occur simultaneously improvement FEF25-75 treatment inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) patient .</detailed_description>
