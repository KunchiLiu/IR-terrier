	<brief_summary>Recent dysvascular diabetic amputee well old , long-term traumatic amputee risk functional decline , joint degeneration , skin breakdown limb loss due force place contralateral limb prosthetic ambulation . If specialize prosthetic gait train proper use appropriate prosthetic foot decrease force intact limb , long term health quality life veteran amputation could substantially improve . We address two key question : Key Question 1 : After receive specialized gait train new prosthetic socket , subject demonstrate difference gait symmetry external mechanical work bionic conventional prosthetic foot , perform various functional activity . Key Question 2 : Can external mechanical work use clinically friendly measure differentiate prosthetic foot ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison External Mechanical Work Between Different Prosthetic Feet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study examine application outcome measure determine change function unilateral transtibial amputee ( TTAs ) cause specialized functional prosthetic training ( train ) use four different prosthetic foot . Two self-report measure i.e . Prosthetic Evaluation Questionnaire ( PEQ-13 ) Locomotor Capability Index ( LCI-5 ) , three performance-based measure i.e . Amputee Mobility Predictor ( AMPPRO ) , Six-minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) , Step Activity Monitor ( SAM ) utilize . Healthy unilateral Transtibial Amputees age 40-65 participate study . Subjects test baseline , receive train exist prosthesis , study socket four prosthetic foot i.e . SACH , SAFE , Talux PROPRIO FOOT 8-10 week period . Training administer testing session .</detailed_description>
