	<brief_title>Inpatient Post Admission Cognitive Therapy ( PACT ) Prevention Suicide Attempts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Suicide remain serious public health problem 4th lead cause death among individual 15-44 year old 2nd leading cause death military . Developing effective intervention suicide behavior state goal National Strategy Suicide Prevention . To date , limited number control study examine efficacy psychosocial intervention reduce suicide behavior . Preliminary finding University Pennsylvania ( Brown et al. , 2005 ) indicate outpatient cognitive therapy reduces likelihood repeat suicide attempt approximately 50 % . Yet efficacy promising new intervention test medical setting specific risk group . We propose adaptation Beck colleague cognitive therapy suicide protocol implementation , feasibility , pilot test inpatient psychiatry set specific delivery military service member family member recent suicide attempt . Suicide attempt behavior one powerful risk factor repeat suicide behavior well eventual death suicide . Delivering brief possibly potent psychotherapeutic intervention patient 's inpatient hospitalization aim directly target individual high risk future suicide behavior , i.e. , young adult , mostly males recent suicide attempt , direct stress military career . We expect adapt intervention , title Post Admission Cognitive Therapy ( PACT ) , show promise reduce likelihood post-hospitalization suicide attempt behavior well psychological risk factor associate suicide depression , hopelessness , suicide ideation , posttraumatic symptom . Our propose design randomize control pilot trial blind outcome assessment . Specific Aims : ( 1 ) To develop evaluate new manual Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy ( PACT ) target inpatient treatment individual admit recent suicide attempt military hospital . ( 2 ) To assess feasibility study 's assessment procedures monitor completion rate outcome measure face-to-face well follow-up phone web-based administration . ( 3 ) To evaluate degree change variability response Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy comparison Enhanced Usual Care post-intervention follow-up ( 1- , 2- , 3-Month ) subsequent suicide attempt behavior ( primary outcome ) well level depression , hopelessness , suicide ideation ( secondary outcome ) . ( 4 ) To examine preliminary manner whether improvement primary secondary outcome measure associate enhance problem solve ability view potential mechanism change cognitive therapy reduction suicide behavior . Study Design : We plan randomize 24 patient hospitalize Walter Reed National Military Medical Center recent suicide attempt one two condition : ( 1 ) Post-Admission Cognitive Therapy + Enhanced Usual Care ( PACT+EUC ) ( 2 ) Enhanced Usual Care ( EUC ) . Individuals age 18 , able communicate English willing provide inform consent recruit . The PACT+EUC condition consist six 60-90 minute individual cognitive therapy session administer preferably 3 day . The EUC condition consist usual care patient receive inpatient facility hospitalization addition assessment service provide independent evaluator work directly research team . The primary outcome variable number subsequent suicide attempt . We expect patient control condition reattempt suicide earlier date higher frequency compare patient enrol intervention condition . Secondary outcome measure include severity depression , hopelessness , suicide ideation . Patients condition assess dependent measure baseline 1- , 2- , 3- month follow-up interval . Data analysis provide estimate statistical power PACT relative EUC time via usage repeat observation data . Our preliminary effect size estimate use future sample size calculation conduct large randomize control trial definitively determine efficacy PACT .</detailed_description>
