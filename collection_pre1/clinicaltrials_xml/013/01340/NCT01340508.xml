	<criteria>Pathologically proven diagnosis adenocarcinoma rectum Clinically determine stage T3 T4 , N0N2 , M0 stag MRI transrectal ultrasound rectum Patients medically operable resectable adenocarcinoma rectum least &lt; 15cm anal verge Adequate liver/renal haematological function . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance 02 Age ≥ 18 year Full blood count obtain within 2 week prior registration study , adequate bone marrow function define follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,800 cells/mm3 Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 Haemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl Serum creatinine within normal institutional limit creatinine clearance ≥ 50 ml/min Bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ALT &lt; 2.5 x IULN Patient must sign study specific informed consent prior study entry Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free minimum 3 year Prior systemic chemotherapy colorectal cancer ; note prior chemotherapy different cancer allowable . Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 12 month Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect Acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ; note , however , HIV test require entry protocol . Evidence uncontrolled seizure , central nervous system disorder , psychiatric disability judge investigator clinically significant , preclude informed consent , interfere compliance oral drug intake . Known , exist uncontrolled coagulopathy . Patients therapeutic anticoagulation may enrol provide clinically stable anticoagulation least 2 week . Major surgery within 28 day study enrollment ( divert colostomy ) Pregnancy woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception ; exclusion necessary treatment involve study may significantly teratogenic Prior allergic reaction capecitabine Any evidence distant metastasis ( M1 ) A synchronous primary colon carcinoma Extension malignant disease anal canal Lack physical integrity gastrointestinal tract ( i.e. , severe Crohn 's disease result malabsorption ; significant bowel resection would make one concerned absorption capecitabine ) malabsorption syndrome would preclude feasibility oral chemotherapy ( capecitabine ) Participation investigational drug study within 28 day study enrollment</criteria>
