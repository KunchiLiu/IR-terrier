	<brief_summary>The prevalence obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) patient admit hospital likely significantly high general population hospitalize patient carry high prevalence co-morbid condition , diabetes cardiovascular disease , commonly associate OSA . The true prevalence OSA hospitalize patient know , though limited data suggest rate OSA hospitalize patient indeed high . Two study report rate polysomnographic ( PSG ) diagnosis OSA patient refer OSA evaluation in-hospital . These study report frequency 77 % ( retrospective study 100 patient ) 88-100 % ( observational study 250 patient ) . Similarly , 2 study evaluate prevalence sleep disorder breathe patient admit acutely decompensated heart failure , find frequency sleep apnea 97 % ( prospective study 29 patient studied PSG ) 75 % ( prospective study 395 consecutive patient study portable monitor ) . However , study limit either study design ( retrospective ) , small number , limited channel portable monitoring , evaluation highly select patient population . Furthermore , none study examine screen tool may help identify patient risk OSA thus might require extensive expensive objective testing . This study test follow hypothesis : 1 . The prevalence OSA unselected hospitalized medical patient 50 % study population . Specific Aim 1 : To determine prevalence OSA group unselected hospitalized medical patient combination sleep symptom PSG perform in-hospital . 2 . Screening tool able accurately identify OSA hospitalize medical patient . Specific Aim 2 : To determine accuracy different screening questionnaire diagnosis OSA hospitalize medical patient compare questionnaire result PSG perform in-hospital .</brief_summary>
