	<detailed_description>SRT3025 develop treatment metabolic diseases . This study first administration SRT3025 humans seek establish initial safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile SRT3025 ( metabolite , analyze ) proceed future Phase 1 study Phase 2 patient study . This protocol detail Phase 1 , randomize , placebo-controlled , single-blind , dose escalation study determine safety , tolerability , PK profile SRT3025 healthy male subject . The study conduct two part . In Part 1A , 6 Cohorts subject receive single escalating dos SRT3025 . In Part 1B , additional one two cohort may enrol investigate effect moderate fat/calorie meal single dose PK endpoint . In Part 2A , three cohort may enrol receive 14-day repeat dos SRT3025 choose Part 1A safety , tolerability , PK data . In Part 2B , one two additional cohort may receive 14-day repeat dos SRT3025 combination moderate fat/calorie meal .</detailed_description>
