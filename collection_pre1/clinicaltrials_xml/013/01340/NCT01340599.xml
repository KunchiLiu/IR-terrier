	<brief_title>Defined Green Tea Catechin Extract Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate short-term effect daily Polyphenon E ( define green tea catechin extract ) administration ( 800 mg epigallocatechin-3-gallate [ EGCG ] daily [ QD ] ) interval prostate biopsy radical prostatectomy ( approximately 6 week ) men localize prostate cancer . II . Compare change level intermediate biomarkers ( Ki-67 , B-cell lymphoma 2 [ Bcl2 ] , cyclin D , KiP1/P27 , vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] , cluster differentiation [ CD ] 31 ) biopsy ( pre-treatment ) prostatectomy ( post-treatment ) specimen collect subject treat Polyphenon E placebo period biopsy prostatectomy . III . Compare change pre- post-treatment serum prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level subject treat Polyphenon E placebo period biopsy prostatectomy . IV . Evaluate bioavailability catechin Polyphenon E ( plasma tissue catechin level , catechin metabolite urine ) . V. Evaluate safety tolerability Polyphenon E subject population . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive define green tea catechin extract orally ( PO ) QD 4-10 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo radical prostatectomy day 28-70 . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD 4-10 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo radical prostatectomy day 28-70 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
