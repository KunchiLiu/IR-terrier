	<brief_summary>To evaluate effect Tai Chi—a mind-body exercise -- age-related loss physiological complexity ( use fractal entropy base measure ) , understand relationship complexity , function adaptability , conduct two-arm prospective randomize clinical trial . Our overarch goal evaluate six month Tai Chi training , compare waitlist control receive standard medical care , enhance physiological complexity adaptability old Tai Chi-naïve adult . Secondary goal study characterize relationship complexity biomarkers , measure function , resilience . This pilot study inform future definitive trial provide information recruitment retention , compliance , dose-dependent effect , preliminary estimate effect size , optimal biomarkers complexity , function , adaptive capacity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim # 1 : To determine 6 month Tai Chi train increase complexity , function , adaptive capacity multiple physiological system older healthy adult . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine relationship biomarkers physiological complexity , conventional measure function adaptive capacity . Statistical regression model use determine relationship , baseline overtime , ) complexity biomarkers measure physical cognitive function , b ) complexity biomarkers adaptive capacity . Elucidating relationship inform interpretation complexity biomarkers provide insight underlie component mechanism contribute complex physiological dynamic .</detailed_description>
