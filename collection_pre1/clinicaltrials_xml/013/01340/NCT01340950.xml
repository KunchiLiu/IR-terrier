	<detailed_description>Advances treatment transform HIV disease chronic illness individual U.S . The common central nervous system ( CNS ) complication chronic HIV disease HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ( HAND ) . In U.S. , HAND prevalence estimate range 55 % treated individual . HAND also common outside U.S. For example , prior project China identify third nearly 150 treated HIV ( + ) individual Anhui Yunnan province HAND . Data support benefit antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) incomplete , many patient return normal neurocognitive performance , bad , develop new neurocognitive impairment take ART . One explanation limit penetration antiretrovirals nervous system . Recent report identify bad antiretroviral penetration characteristic associated bad control HIV replication worse neurocognitive performance . Most report , however , focus treatment - rather prevention - HAND . Like many medical condition , prevention HAND may cost-effective public health goal treat disease already occur . We build prior work China perform phase 4 , randomize , control clinical trial safety effectiveness ART differs penetration characteristic 250 ART-naive individual normal neurocognitive performance . The primary objective determine effect well penetrating ( BP ) ART ( zidovudine-lamivudine-nevirapine ) compare bad penetrating ( WP ) ART ( tenofovir-lamivudine-efavirenz ) prevention HAND . We hypothesize volunteer randomize BP-ART less likely neurocognitively decline 96 week observation randomize WP-ART . The secondary objective ass influence study outcomes two condition : persistent immune activation viral hepatitis . In exploratory aim , project also assess influence study outcome concise panel drug disposition-associated genetic polymorphism . Demonstrating HAND prevent use BP-ART influence HIV treatment guideline U.S. , China , elsewhere ultimately lead preservation normal neurocognitive functioning people afflict HIV/AIDS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman least 18 year age . Ability willingness subject give write informed consent . HIV1 infection , document enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) confirm Western blot time prior study entry . Plasma HIV1 RNA acceptable alternative confirmatory test . Antiretroviral drugnaïve , define ≤10 day ART time prior entry . Clinical HIV1 RNA ≥1000 copies/mL obtain within 90 day study screen . Clinical blood CD4+ cell count &lt; 350/mm3 ( men ) &lt; 250/mm3 ( woman ) within 60 day study screen . Performance within expect normal range project 's comprehensive , standardized battery neuropsychological test within 4 week . For woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) , negative serum urine pregnancy test screening within 48 hour prior initiate study medication . Serious illness require systemic treatment hospitalization within 4 week . Unacceptable laboratory value obtain within 4 week prior study entry . Untreated syphilis . Child Pugh Class C hepatic impairment . Active Hepatitis B Virus infection . Known allergy/sensitivity study drug formulation . Severe untreated condition could affect NP test performance . Such condition include limited current substance use disorder , poorly control diabetes , uncontrolled seizure disorder , progressive CNS disorder ( e.g. , multiple sclerosis , CNS neoplasm ) evidence acute intoxication withdrawal , opinion study clinician . Use immunomodulators ( e.g. , interleukin , interferon , cyclosporine ) , HIV vaccine , systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , investigational therapy within 30 day prior study entry . Currently breastfeed . Requirement medication absolute contraindication study drug . In addition , exclude people take rifampin . Current imprisonment involuntary incarceration medical facility psychiatric physical illness . Prior use nucleoside analogue , tenofovir , adefovir , lamivudine , treatment hepatitis B great 8 week subject know HIVinfected . Any condition , opinion investigator , would compromise subject 's ability participate study .</criteria>
