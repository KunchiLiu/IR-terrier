	<brief_summary>Background : - The best treatment ovarian relate female reproductive tract cancer yet know patient whose disease respond recurred standard treatment . The cancer treatment drug pegaspargase ( ONCASPAR ( Trademark ) ) , work differently standard chemotherapy , approve treat leukemia give small number patient ovarian type cancer . Because pegaspargase may reduce development cancer cell blood vessel cell contribute cancer growth ability spread , treatment pegaspargase could shrink ovarian cancer tumor help ovarian cancer patient live long few symptom disease . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness pegaspargase patient recurrent refractory ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer , and/or primary peritoneal cancer . Eligibility : - Women least 18 year age diagnose epithelial ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal cancer respond least one operation , chemotherapy , and/or radiotherapy . Design : - Before start study , participant screen medical history , blood test , image scan affected area , tumor biopsy , test direct study doctor . - Participants receive infusion pegaspargase Day 1 Day 15 28-day cycle . - Participants dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) start study , begin pegaspargase , 6 week treatment . This test determine pegaspargase affect blood flow cancer site . - Participants compute tomography scan imaging every cycle ( approximately every 8 week ) determine whether therapy affect cancer site . - The treatment repeat long participant tolerate medication cancer either steady improving .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Clinical Activity Pegaspargase Women With Relapsed Refractory Epithelial Ovarian Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer , and/or Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - The bacterial enzyme L-asparaginase ( L-ASP ) catalyze hydrolysis asparagine aspartate use treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) .Studies demonstrate vitro cytotoxic activity solid tumor type include ovarian cancer . - Our laboratory demonstrate L-ASP inhibits vascular remodel modulates heterotypic adhesion interaction ovarian cancer cell endothelial cell . Results indicate L-ASP ability modify local tumor microenvironment . - Epithelial ovarian cancer require neovascularization growth metastasis . Anti-angiogenesis agent show promise treatment recurrent disease . - The pegylated form L-ASP , pegaspargase , ( Sigma Tau ONCASPAR ( Trademark ) ) show deplete serum level asparagine approve ALL . ONCASPAR clinical trial gemcitabine pancreatic cancer solid tumor . - Recommended dose pegaspargase ALL 2,500 IU/m^2 every two week intramuscular ( IM ) /intravenous ( IV ) . IM dose 2,000 IU/m^2 every two week study phase I protocol various solid tumor . - Demonstration safety anti-angiogenic activity lead combination study . Primary Objectives : - To preliminarily evaluate anti-tumor activity pegaspargase , 2,000 IU/ m^2 every two week intravenous ( IV ) ( intramuscular ( IM ) ) explore association toxicity clinical outcome . - To evaluate safety pegaspargase patient recurrent refractory ovarian , fallopian tube , and/or primary peritoneal cancer . Secondary Objectives : - To explore change circulate angiogenic cytokine treatment pegaspargase . - To measure apoptosis proliferation tumor ( malignant effusion ) protein array therapy . - To evaluate change tumor vascularity use dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Eligibility : - Women epithelial ovarian cancer , fallopian tube cancer , and/or primary peritoneal cancer persistent , relapse and/or refractory prior therapy . - There limit number prior treatment regimen . Patients may previously receive L-ASP . - Women must disease amenable biopsy malignant effusion ( pleural effusion ascites ) may serially tap . - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . - Evidence adequate end organ function normal coagulation parameter ( prothrombin time ( PT ) , activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ) . Design : - Women receive 2,000 IU/m^2 pegaspargase intravenously every two week 28-day cycle disease progression , excessive toxicity , withdrawal study . - Biopsy tumor dynamic contrast-enhanced-magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) perform prior start pegaspargase ( mandatory ) 6 week treatment ( optional ) . - Clinical outcome measure correlated biological endpoint . - Research blood sample take assess change serum vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , interleukin-6 ( IL6 ) , interleukin-8 ( IL8 ) . - Blood collected evaluate circulate endothelial cell . - Patients see clinic every 4 week outcome measure every cycle .</detailed_description>
