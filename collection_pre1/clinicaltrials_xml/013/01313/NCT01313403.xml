	<brief_summary>Background : - Medications treat major depression act brain chemical call serotonin , bind receptor brain cell . More research need serotonin receptor work brain , image study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) provide information receptor function brain individual depression healthy volunteer . The experimental radioactive chemical [ 11C ] CUMI design react serotonin receptor , researcher interest study effectiveness use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan see well get brain . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness radiotracer [ 11C ] CUMI brain image study serotonin receptor . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 55 year age either diagnose major depressive disorder healthy volunteer . Design : - Participants screen full medical history , physical psychiatric examination , blood urine test , questionnaire mood . Participants also electrocardiogram visit . - At first study visit , participant MRI scan brain provide baseline data brain function . - At second study visit , participant PET scan [ 11C ] CUMI contrast agent . - No treatment provide part protocol ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imaging Serotonin 5HT1A Receptors Patients With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighteen million people United States currently suffer Major Depressive Disorder , characterize episode low mood , poor self attitude poor vitality . Of suffer Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) , one third completely improve , even among case , wait period several week antidepressant take effect . Our inability adequately treat MDD evident rank number one Disability Adjusted Life Years ( DALY ) among person age 15-44 . Given profound burden , improve understanding molecular basis MDD utmost importance development novel antidepressant medication . Serotoninergic neurotransmission implicate MDD , demonstrate relative success selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) . SSRIs block reuptake serotonin serotonin transporter , increase serotonin synaptic cleft . Serotonin bind 5-HT1A receptor , G-protein couple receptor present presynaptically postsynaptically . Presynaptically , receptor act autoinhibitory receptor , trigger decreased firing rate serotonin release . This autoinhibition , last two week , believe reason patient experience delay symptomatic improvement initiation SSRIs . Serotonin bind postsynaptic receptor mediate symptomatic improvement depression . Multiple positron emission tomography ( PET ) study utilize antagonist 5-HT1A conduct . The result mixed , note increase others note decreased 5-HT1A brain patient MDD . While clinical heterogeneity effect previous treatment SSRIs may confound factor , lack consistent finding could also secondary use antagonist rather agonist radioligands . Unlike agonist , antagonist unable discriminate 5-HT1A high low affinity state , high affinity state , G-protein-coupled , allow activity 5-HT1A receptor . We propose PET study use 5-HT1A radiolabelled agonist , C ( 11 ) CUMI , determine whether difference density distribution 5-HT1A high affinity state brain patient MDD versus control . We perform internal control 1-5 day initiation SSRI determine whether increase serotonin cause detectable displacement C ( 11 ) CUMI . At 4-8 week initiation SSRI treatment , reimage patient determine whether change density 5-HT1A high affinity state .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients MDD ( Inclusion criterion ) : 1 . Subjects must 1855 year old . 2 . Subjects must able willing give write informed consent . 3 . Subjects must DSMIV diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) . 4 . Subjects must time study enrollment experience episode Major Depression per DSMIV criterion , demonstrate Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ; 17 item ) great 18 ( Williams , 1988 ) . Healthy Volunteers ( Inclusion criterion ) : 1 . Subjects must adults 1855 year old . 2 . Subjects must able willing give write informed consent . 3 . Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS17 item ) less 8 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients MDD ( Exclusion criterion ) : 1 . With exception substance abuse anxiety disorder , past current Axis I diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder . With regard substance abuse disorder , allow past diagnosis long question substance alcohol dependence , patient substance abuse pattern year prior enrollment , criterion regard LSD ecstasy use meet ( see ) . We screen substance abuse pattern year prior enrollment exclude heavy alcohol use , define great 14 drink per week men great 7 drink per week woman . With regard anxiety disorder , allow past present diagnosis Generalized Anxiety Disorder , social phobia panic disorder , long anxiety disorder felt outweigh magnitude diagnosis Major Depressive Disorder . This determined clinical investigator protocol . Particular attention make ensure patient diagnosis Bipolar disorder , Schizoaffective disorder Premenstrual dysphoric disorder ( PMDD ) . 2 . Any history Lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) use , may alter serotonin receptor property . 3 . History ecstasy use 3 time life , may alter serotonin receptor property . 4 . Current suicidality serious depressive symptom warrant intensive management weekly visit psychiatric outpatient clinic 5 . Psychiatric symptoms warrant psychotropic medication select SSRI study drug . The exception infrequent use benzodiazepine ( e.g . lorazepam ( Ativan ) , 0.51.0 mg anxiety ) . Infrequent define less often 3 time per week . 6 . In woman , irregular menses possible determine phase cycle . This previous data show phase menstrual cycle may affect 5HT1A bind radioligand . 7 . Clinically significant laboratory abnormality . 8 . Psychotropic medication use ( include benzodiazepine illicit drug ) 21 day ( 42 day fluoxetine ) prior PET scan . The exception would 15 dos 0.51.0mg benzodiazepine ( lorazepam ( Ativan ) ) mouth , separate least 24 hour dos , anxiety relate study procedure . 9 . Serious medical problem include limited chronic neurological disease multiple sclerosis , autoimmune disease , brain mass lesion &gt; 1cm diameter . 10 . Positive HIV status . 11 . Metallic foreign body would affect MRI magnet , fear enclose space likely make subject unable undergo MRI scan . 12 . Head trauma result period unconsciousness lasting longer 10 minute . 13 . History fetal alcohol syndrome neurodevelopmental disorder . 14 . Recent exposure radiation ( i.e. , PET research ) combine study would allowable limit . 15 . Positive urine drug screen . 16 . Inability lie flat camera bed 2.5 h 17 . History adverse reaction medication plan use patient , select among sertraline ( Zoloft ) , citalopram ( Celexa ) escitalopram ( Lexapro ) 18 .
