	<brief_title>This 2 Year Follow Clinical Radiographic Analysis Novel All Polyethelene Glenoid Component Standard Total Shoulder Arthroplasty .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods Materials : The standard care practice practice arthroplasty patient return annual clinical radiographic evaluation . We ask patient choose enroll study simply return routine `` standard care '' follow . The deviation standard care method obtain xrays . In study obtain true AP ( anterior/posterior ) axillary view return visit . These normal `` standard care '' xrays . The difference go obtain Xrays use fluoroscopic guidance . The reason use fluoroscopic guidance want make sure xrays perfect beam orient tangential backside glenoid . This allow u see lucencies behind glenoid allow u truly assess loosening . Standard Xrays attempt beam orient tangential glenoid small deviation underestimate potential lucent line . This expose study subject small amount radiation would outside `` standard care '' . The patient inform dose record . The fluoroscopy procedure take 15-20 minute , total radiation exposure activity perform , three minute . The total radiation le 3 rem . A licensed radiology technologist ( RT ) employ hospital perform fluoroscopy procedure Xrays . Jeff Jarnagin PA Edwin Spencer MD present time fluoroscopy procedure . Both Dr Spencer Jeff Jarnagin involve similar study complete `` train human research subject protection '' . Subjects provide proper shielding ( lead apron ) throughout activity . The licensed radiology technologist hospital final responsibility provide proper shield . As every clinical study , may risk . Since fluoroscope emit X-rays , subject expose radiation . During fluoroscopy , actual dose radiation exposure administer , within minimal risk limit much low know produce detectable health effect . For study , fluoroscopy machine , , 3 minute total amount radiation exceed 3 rem include radiation standard Xrays . According published literature , exposure risk 5-10 rem minimal . Health effect consistently demonstrate radiation exposure 10 rem . Subjects also fill 2 data sheet . One PENN score ASES ( Association Shoulder Elbow Surgeons ) score validate clinical outcome measure . These form routinely fill annual clinical visit consider standard care . Data Analysis : The radiograph independently evaluate 2 different board certify radiologist blind clinical result names patient . The films re-evaluated radiologist ( blinded initial reading ) average result record . The clinical ASES PENN score record difference preoperative postoperative score report . Statistical analysis student test necessary comparing two group however simple descriptive statistic use report change ASES PENN score importantly presence absence lucent line location lucencies . The lucent line grade accord method develop Lazarus et al.4 The medical record Xray data keep confidential possible current local , state , federal law . The researcher examine medical record information relate shoulder study data . The medical record identify subject consent form review researcher . The result research project may present meeting publication . The identity subject disclose presentation publication . The Xrays store secure place Knoxville Orthopaedic Clinic . These Xrays accessible approve personnel . They keep indefinitely possibility future use research publication . Personnel access information include : - Jeff Jarnagin PA ( Assistant Dr Spencer ) - Dr. Edwin Spencer , PI ( Orthopaedic Surgeon ) Risk Analysis : The risk involve extra amount radiation require obtain floroscopically guided Xrays . As state maximum amount radiation 3 rem include radiation standard Xrays . According published literature , exposure risk 5-10 rem minimal . Health effect consistently demonstrate radiation exposure 10 rem . To protect subject licensed radiology technologist ( RT ) employ hospital perform fluoroscopy procedure Xrays . Jeff Jarnagin PA Edwin Spencer MD present time fluoroscopy procedure . Subjects provide proper shielding ( lead apron ) throughout activity . The licensed radiology technologist hospital final responsibility provide proper shielding . The benefit patient researcher ( reader publish data ) garner good understand best method resurface glenoid TSA . Many patient require bilateral operation therefore could directly benefit patient essentially project design gather information great good patient require TSA . Subject Identification , Recruitment And Consent : Subjects identify unique identification number analogous use Knoxville Orthopaedic Clinic . Subjects call either Dr Edwin E Spencer Jr MD ( PI ) assistant Jeff Jarnagin PA ask involved participate . The patient make aware participation study completely voluntary participation affect future access care Dr Spencer . Informed consent review phone person come Xrays Dr Spencer assistant Jeff Jarnagin PA . Attached consent form . Once subject complete xray evaluation complete clinical form , pay $ 50 stipend . The subject incur cost participation study . Insurance carrier bill part study . The money patient come study sponsor DePuy Inc . The xrays include floroscopy radiologist ' reading pay study sponsor DePuy . The surgeon , Dr Spencer , pay time effort donate time science great good .</detailed_description>
