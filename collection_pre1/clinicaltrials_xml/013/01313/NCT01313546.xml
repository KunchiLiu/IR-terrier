	<brief_title>A Comparison Sartorius Vs. Quadriceps Evoked Motor Response Femoral Nerve Prevent Secondary Catheter Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Continuous femoral nerve block ( c FNB ) widely use regional anesthetic technique many low limb operation . It provide superior pain relief , fast ambulation , short hospital stay less risk side effect compare patient control analgesia ( PCA ) . Stimulating catheter ( SC ) : SC introduce back 1999 provide objective end point guide catheter position maintain desired evoked muscle response . Stimulating catheter continuous femoral nerve block : Salinas et al compare stimulate catheter vs. non-stimulating catheter volunteer femoral nerve block . They maintain quadriceps evoked muscle twitch &lt; 0.5 mA stimulating catheter . They report block success 100 % via stimulate catheter versus 85 % via non-stimulating catheter ( P = 0.07 ) much dense motor block pain score SC compare NSC . Motor responses femoral nerve : With peripheral nerve stimulation femoral nerve , two response may elicit , sartorius muscle contraction ( contraction sartorius muscle stimulation muscular branch ) quadriceps muscle contraction patella twitch ( contraction quadriceps muscle stimulation respective muscular branch ) . The two division femoral nerve fact medial lateral division rather anterior posterior . The medial division supply sartorius muscle lateral division supply quadriceps muscle division lay within close proximity fascial plane . Several regional anesthesia text state anterior branch , supply motor branch sartorius fascia iliaca partly stimulation seek FNB would inadequate spread around femoral nerve . An anatomical study Gustafson et al anatomical text forfeit theory , . Furthermore , rectus femoris quadriceps often get part innervation division supply sartorius muscle . Most author advocate preferentially search quadriceps muscle response articular branch derive posterior lateral division femoral nerve . However , success femoral nerve block use either quadriceps sartorius twitch confirm randomise control trial . Secondary catheter failure : defined failure peripheral continuous nerve block provide adequate pain relieve primary block institute . The incidence range 10 - 40 % depend definition use , , . A lot time , money hospital resource invest place peripheral nerve catheter objective provide optimal pain management faster recovery . We hypothesize success FNB use sartorius muscle twitch equivalent quadriceps muscle twitch response . To test hypothesis , conduct prospective randomize double-blind control trial compare femoral nerve block inguinal crease use sartorius quadriceps muscle twitch end point stimulation via stimulating catheter . Methods : With institutional ethical approval ( Faculty Medicine , University Toronto , Canada ) obtain write informed consent , plan recruit 40 patient , age 18-75 , ASA I-III schedule undergo unilateral total knee arthroplastly prospective , randomise , single blind controlled trial . Exclusion criterion : patient history significant medical psychiatric problem , BMI &gt; 40 , allergy local anesthetic drug , prior surgery inguinal region , neurological disease sensory motor deficit , diabetic neuropathy . In block room : patient premedicated acetaminophen 1000 mg , celecoxib 400 mg gabapentin 400 600 mg part multimodal pain regimen . After 18-gauge IV cannula place , patient receive midazolam ( 0.03 mg/kg ) anxiolysis routine monitor attach . Randomization : Patients randomize random computer allocation 2 group : group 1 = sartorius muscle twitch ( SMT ) , group 2 = quadriceps muscle twitch ( QMT ) . Continuous Femoral Nerve block : After aseptic skin disinfection sterile drape inguinal region , 38 mm broadband 13-6 MHz linear array ultrasound ( US ) probe ( Philips HD 11XE , Bothell , WA ) place skin locate position femoral nerve inguinal crease . The ultrasound transducer cover sterile , transparent dress TegadermTM HP ( 3M Heath Care , St. Paul , MN ) . Sterile conductivity gel Ultra/Phonic ( Pharmaceutical Innovations TM , Newark , NJ ) use . In plane plane approach use guide tuohy needle towards femoral nerve . A skin wheal raise 2 3 mLs local anesthetic solution ( 1 % lidocaine ) , peripheral nerve stimulator ( PNS ) initial current output 1mA ( frequency 2Hz , pulse width 0.1ms ) use verify type evoke muscle response . The stimulate tuohy needle insert 45º angle skin , 1 cm lateral femoral artery pulsation towards femoral nerve ultrasound guidance . The anesthesiologist seek either sartorius quadriceps muscle evoke muscle response base random number allocation seal opaque envelope . The stimulate needle adjusted appropriate muscle twitch obtain current less 0.4 mA , catheter thread 3-5 cm pas needle tip maintain spread local anesthetic solution short axis view . Plain ropivacaine 0.5 % mixed lidocaine 1 % injected increment 5 mL negative aspiration total 20 mL . To determine spread local anesthetic agent divide area around femoral nerve 8 pie-chart sector femoral nerve middle . For documentation use piece transparency film pie chart eight even sector draw . The film position US image center pie chart position middle femoral nerve upper edge film parallel upper edge US image . Having do , could determine local anesthetic spread compare two group . Time femoral nerve location ( time needle enter skin localization plexus adequate twitch ) , time catheter insertion ( start end catheter insertion ) time completion drug injection ( start end drug injection ) document . Motor Sensory assessment : Motor block femoral nerve , sensory block femoral , saphenous , lateral femoral cutaneous nerve evaluate blind observer every 5 minute period 30 minute post block insertion . A 22 G hypodermic needle use assess sensation femoral nerve distribution : middle third medial thigh , lateral femoral cutaneous nerve : lateral thigh , saphenous nerve : anteriomedial middle third leg . Sensation grade 0 = normal sensation , 1 = dull sensation , 2 = sensation . Motor block evaluation grade 0 = full power , 1= partial block ( paresis ) , 2 = complete block ( paralysis ) . The quadriceps muscle strength assess grade ability inability extend leg operate limb gravity hip passively flex 45° . Complete femoral nerve block define complete loss sharp sensation middle third medial thigh complete inability extend knee joint hip flexion 45º 30 minute post block insertion . After completion 30 minute assessment period , patient receive sciatic nerve block spinal anesthesia . Sciatic nerve block perform use subgluteal approach 20ml 0.5 % plain ropivicaine . Spinal anesthesia perform lateral position operate side uppermost . Intrathecal isobaric bupivacaine 10 mg 10 µg fentanyl inject sterile condition use 25 G whitacre needle . Postoperative period : patient receive acetaminophen 1000mg q6 hourly , celexocib 200mg q12 hourly gabapentin 200mg q8 hourly give orally . Patients also receive hydromorphone contin 3mg q8 hourly hydromorphone patient control analgesia ( PCA ) breakthrough postoperative pain . Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) assess 4 hourly first 48 hour . Total hydromorphone consumption time first PCA dose record . The patient give 24 h diary record VAS . The research assistant interview patient postoperative day one two . VAS score document patient diary nursing record . The primary end point study number secondary femoral nerve block failure 24 hour past catheter insertion . A dull needle use test sensory dermatomes femoral nerve ( mid thigh medial aspect ) . Normal sensation compare non-operative site consider failure catheter . Secondary catheter failure define lack impaired sensory deficit medial anterior aspect mid thigh . The study design pilot study obtain estimate upon base future large trial . As rigorous sample size calculation provide . The goal recruit minimum 12 subject per group , number , require construct confidence interval ( Statistical Rules Thumb Gerald van Belle , 2002 , John Wiley Sons ) . To account potential drop , number increase 20 per group . Secondary outcome include ; time perform block , VAS score 24 hour , total oral hydromorphone use hydromorphone PCA , spread local anesthetic around femoral nerve . Statistical analysis perform use SAS Version 9.1 ( SAS Institute , Cary , North Carolina , USA ) . Implications : - Operating room efficiency : average femoral nerve catheter technique take around 20-25 minute complete . Part delay execution procedure elicit quadriceps twitch stimulate catheter . If study prof two elicit twitch equally efficacious , shorten procedure time 7-10 minute . - Potential nerve injury : minimal tuohy needle manipulation could potentially reduce risk nerve injury - Patient discomfort : Minimal needle manipulation lead decrease patient discomfort .
