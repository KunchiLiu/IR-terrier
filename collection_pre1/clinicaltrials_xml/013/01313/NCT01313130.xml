	<brief_summary>Traumatic brain injury cause permanent problem think , memory , control emotion , organization planning . Thousands soldier , marine , military personnel injury brain due war Iraq Afghanistan . Very large number civilian , perhaps 1.5 million people per year , United States also traumatic brain injury cause car accident , fall , sports-related injury assault . We n't know much traumatic brain injury right , important new advance technology may help u learn lot injury . One advance involve new type MRI scan think able show happen brain trauma clearly regular scan . The first new scan call diffusion tensor imaging , show injury axon ( wire brain ) . The second new scan call resting-state functional MRI correlation analysis , show well various part brain connect . Importantly , new type scan do use regular scanner already every major hospital . The innovation entirely scanner use result picture analyze computer take . We already test scan military civilian patient brain injury find helpful far . Our overall goal see whether new MRI scan useful active duty military personnel recent traumatic brain injury . The important goal see amount injury show scan use predict well patient overall next 6-12 month . A related goal see whether injury specific part brain see new scan use predict whether patient likely specific problem like memory loss , attention deficit , depression , post-traumatic stress disorder . We would also like see whether scan could even useful combine information genetic factor ( inherited parent ) test blood . Another important goal compare effect traumatic brain injury cause blast explosion injury cause , find unique blast injury . A final goal repeat scan 6-12 month later see whether new MRI scan show whether injury brain heal , gotten bad , stay . These new scan could help decision whether military personnel return duty , sort rehabilitation treatment would benefit , family member watch expect .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Clinical diagnosis blastrelated TBI severity , make LRMC TBI screen team , base clinical history , examination , and/or clinical imaging perform part standard care ( CT , conventional MRI ) . This include participant primary blast additional mechanism injury ( `` blastplus '' injury ) 2 . Acute injury injury , define first occur 030 day prior enrollment . 3 . Ability provide inform consent . 4 . Ability lie still supine position duration scan session , e.g . severe claustrophobia limit pain injury . 5. know metallic implant metallic foreign object . 6. known HIV positive 7. know pregnant 8. previous major traumatic brain injury 9. contraindication MRI medical reason arrhythmias</criteria>
