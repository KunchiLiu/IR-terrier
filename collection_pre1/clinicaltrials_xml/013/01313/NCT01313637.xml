Subjects meet eligibility criterion Screening ( Visit 1 ) complete 7 to14 day run-in period follow randomization visit ( Visit 2 ) 24-week treatment period . There total 9 clinic study visit . A follow-up phone contact adverse event assessment conduct approximately one week last study visit ( Visit 9 Early Withdrawal ) . The total duration subject participation study approximately 27 week . A subset subject select site also perform 24-hour serial spirometry Holter monitoring study provide serial blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis . Sparse pharmacokinetic sample population pharmacokinetic analysis obtain non-subset subject . The primary measure efficacy clinic visit trough ( pre-bronchodilator pre-dose ) FEV1 Treatment Day 169 .

	<detailed_description>This 24-week , phase III multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study . Eligible subject randomize GSK573719/GW642444 125/25mcg , GSK573719 125mcg , GW642444 25mcg , placebo treatment group 3:3:3:2 ratio plan 1463 total number randomize subject approximately 399 subject randomize active treatment group 266 subject randomize placebo . All treatment administer once-daily morning inhalation use Novel Dry Powder Inhaler ( Novel DPI ) . There total 9 study clinic visit conduct outpatient basis . Subjects meet eligibility criterion Screening ( Visit 1 ) complete 7 14 day run-in period follow 24-week treatment period . Clinic visit Screening , Randomization ( Day 1 ) , Day 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24-weeks treatment , 1 day Week 24 Visit ( also refer Treatment Day 169 ) . A follow-up contact adverse assessment conduct telephone approximately 7 day Visit 9 Early Withdrawal Visit . The total duration subject participation , include follow-up approximately 27 week . All subject provide albuterol/salbutamol use `` as-needed '' basis throughout run-in study treatment period . At screen , pre-bronchodilator spirometry test follow post-albuterol/salbutamol spirometry test . Post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1 FEV1/FVC value use determine subject eligibility . To characterize bronchodilator responsiveness , post-ipratropium testing conduct follow completion post-albuterol/salbutamol spirometry . Spirometry conduct post-randomization clinic visit . Six hour post-dose serial spirometry conduct Visits 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 . Trough spirometry obtain 23 24 hour previous day 's dose blind study medication Visits 3 9 . All subject provide electronic diary ( eDiary ) completion daily even throughout run-in treatment period . Subjects use eDiary record dyspnea score use Shortness Breath Daily Activities instrument ( SOBDA ) , daily use supplemental albuterol/salbutamol either puffs/day metered-dose inhaler ( MDI ) and/or nebule use per day , healthcare contact relate COPD . Additional assessment dyspnea obtain use Baseline Transition Dyspnea Index ( BDI/TDI ) interviewer base instrument . At Visit 2 , severity dyspnea baseline assess use BDI . At subsequent visit ( Visits 4 , 6 , 8 ) change baseline assess use TDI . Disease specific health status evaluate use subject-completed St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) . The SGRQ complete Visits 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 . Administration SGRQ BDI/TDI do prior spirometry test . The occurrence adverse event evaluate throughout study begin Visit 2 . SAEs collect time period AEs . However , SAEs assess related study participation ( e.g. , study treatment , protocol-mandated procedure , invasive test , change exist therapy ) relate GSK concomitant medication , record time subject consent participate study include follow contact . Additional safety assessment vital sign ( blood pressure pulse rate ) , 12-lead ECGs standard clinical laboratory test ( hematology chemistry ) obtain select clinic visit . Blood sample population pharmacokinetic analysis obtain . At select study site , subset approximately 198 subject perform 24-hour serial spirometry study evaluation lung function dose period . In conjunction serial spirometry , subset subject also perform 24 hour Holter monitoring provide blood sample PK analysis .</detailed_description>
