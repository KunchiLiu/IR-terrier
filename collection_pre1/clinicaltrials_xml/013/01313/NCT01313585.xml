	<brief_summary>This study compare absolute relative effectiveness asthma management patient inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) maintenance therapy Easi-breathe® ( EB ) - beclometasone dipropionate ( BDP ) breath-actuated inhaler ( BAI ) - as-needed ( prn ) reliever medication ( short-acting beta2-agonist [ SABA ] therapy ) via either BAI ( i.e . Easi-breathe® [ EB ] salbutamol ) via pressurise meter dose inhaler ( MDI ) ( e.g . MDI salbutamol ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current asthma guideline UK underpin evidence derive randomise control trial ( RCTs ) . Although RCT data consider gold standard , patient recruit asthma RCTs estimate represent le 10 % UK 's asthma population . The poor representation asthma population due number factor , tightly-controlled inclusion criterion RCTs . There , therefore , need representative RCTs real-life observational study inform exist guideline help optimise asthma outcome . Inhalation therapy cornerstone asthma treatment , use delivery 'reliever ' bronchodilator therapy ( e.g . salbutamol ) well anti-inflammatory corticosteroid 'maintenance ' 'controller ' therapy . Currently available inhaler device include MDIs , breath-actuated MDIs ( BAIs ) , dry powder inhaler ( DPIs ) . Both BAIs DPIs actuate patient 's inhalation manoeuvre , MDIs actuate patient 's press button , must thus coordinate inhalation . The clinical effectiveness inhalation therapy derive delivery drug target sit lung , evidence mount suboptimal use inhaler device common problem contribute compromise asthma control many patient . Indeed , decrease asthma control link number mistake use MDIs deliver inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) . There also evidence ability patient use different inhaler device type variable . Nonetheless , recent review RCTs , recognise importance inhaler technique , conclude inhaler device differ significantly efficacy cheap inhaler device use . However , result base RCTs applied care light aforementioned issue around external validity RCTs ability extrapolate finding across broad patient population . Moreover , patient enrol RCTs typically receive extensive training must demonstrate maintain proper inhaler technique , seldom accomplish real-world setting . The aim study compare absolute relative effectiveness ICS ( maintenance ) plus SABA ( reliever ) therapy deliver via same-type device ( namely BDP via EB plus salbutamol via EB [ BAI ] ) deliver via different device type ( i.e . BDP via EB [ BAI ] plus SABA via MDI ) real-life , representative , UK primary care asthma population .</detailed_description>
