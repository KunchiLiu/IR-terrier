	<detailed_description>Hand , foot , mouth disease ( HFMD ) common viral illness infant child cause virus belong enterovirus genus picornavirus family . Although HFMD case result serious complication , outbreak HFMD cause enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) present high rate neurological complication , include meningoencephalitis , pulmonary complication , even cause infant death . HFMD cause EV71 become major emerge infectious disease Asia highly pathogenic potential EV71 clearly require attention world medical community . The development vaccine EV71 active ongoing Asian country . Several study examine effectiveness inactivated viral vaccine EV71 animal model . A wide range experimental EV71 vaccine approach study include heat-inactivated formaldehyde-inactivated virion , EV71 virus-like particle ( VLP ) , VP1 recombinant protein , VP1 DNA vaccine , VP1 peptide-based vaccine target neutralize domain , bacterial viral vector express VP1 , Vero cell-adapted live attenuate virus . Furthermore , neutralize antibody EV71 suggest one important factor prevention severe EV71 infection . Recently , inactivated vaccine ( vero cell ) EV71 license SFDA China , clinical trial phase Ib arm evaluate safety Chinese healthy child infant also provide evidence EV71 vaccine immunogenicity probable immunize dose .</detailed_description>
