	<brief_summary>Objectives : To prove non-inferiority Targin compare Oxycontin term change pain intensity 1 . Primary objective : Change pain intensity ( NRS 0-10 ) score ( average pain 24 hour obtain even ) within 4 week 2 . Secondary objective : Bowel Habit ( worsening/no change/improving ) , Total dose frequency rescue medication , Quality Life ( QOL ; EORTC QLQ-C30 ) , Duration need laxative use Adverse event</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Male female cancer patient 20 year age old 2 . Cancer relate pain require treatment continuous aroundtheclock strong opioid analgesic 3 . Moderate severe pain intensity ( NRS pain score 4 ) 4 . Opioid naïve patient patient treat strong opioids ( except PRN ) within 4 week patient weak opioids 5 . Subject provide sign dated write voluntary inform consent 1 . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant . UNLESS : woman whose career , lifestyle , sexual orientation precludes intercourse male partner woman shoe partner sterilize vasectomy mean two birth control method . The two method double barrier method barrier method plus hormonal method . Adequate barrier method contraception include : diaphragm , condom ( partner ) , intrauterine device ( copper hormonal ) , sponge spermicide . Hormonal contraceptive include market contraceptive agent include estrogen and/or progestational agent . 2 . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive urine pregnancy test . 3 . Have previously receive treatment Targin Oxycontin within 4weeks ( 28days ) screening period ( include PRN ) 4 . If subject start first cycle chemotherapy 2 week screen visit study , exclude study . And If chemotherapy regimen dosage plan change study , subject exclude study . 5 . Patient administer laxative stable dose 1 week 6 . Patient evidence significant structural/functional abnormality GI tract appropriate oral medicine administration . Any history hypersensitivity Oxycodone Naloxone 7 . Patients significant respiratory depression 8 . Patients acute severe bronchial asthma hypercarbia 9 . Any patient suspect paralytic ileus 10 . Severe Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , pulmonary heart disease 11 . Targin product contains lactose . Patients rare hereditary problem galactose intolerance , Lapp lactase deficiency glucosegalactose malabsorption take 12 . Patients moderate severe hepatic impairment 13 . Abnormal aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ; SGOT ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ; SGPT ) , alkaline phosphatase level ( &gt; 2.5 time upper limit normal , allow &gt; 5 time upper limit normal case transition liver ) abnormal total bilirubin and/or creatinine level ( ) ( great 1.5 time upper limit normal ) 14 . Any situation opioids contraindicate 15 . Major surgery within 1 month prior screen plan surgery 16 . Mainly pain originated cancer cancer relate condition ( eg . Musculoskeletal pain , inflammatory pain , diabetic polyneuropathy ) 17 . Patients know suspected unstable brain metastasis spinal cord compression may require change steroid treatment throughout duration study 18 . Patients uncontrolled seizure 19 . Requiring interventional treatment pain neurodestructive procedure regional infusion 20 . With history alcohol abuse within 6 month screen 21 . With history illicit drug abuse within 6 month screen 22 . Patients increase intracranial pressure 23 . In investigator 's opinion , subject receive hypnotic central nervous system ( CNS ) depressant may pose risk additional CNS depression opioid study medication 24 . Patients myxoedema , adequately treat hypothyroidism Addison 's disease 25 . Patients receive opioid substitution therapy opioid addiction ( e.g . methadone buprenorphine ) 26 . Patients evidence clinically significant gastrointestinal disease ( e.g . paralytic ileus , peritoneal carcinosis ) , significant structural abnormality gastrointestinal tract ( e.g . scarring , obstruction etc ) either relate related underlying cancer disease progression 27 . Patients suffer diarrhea and/or opioid withdrawal 28 . With disability may prevent patient complete study requirement particular , interfere 24hrs pain intensity score 29 . Clinically significant impairment cardiovascular , respiratory renal function 30 . Patient need acute dose titration whose pain intensity fluctuate significantly short period accord investigator 's judgment 31 . Having use investigational drug time enrollment , within 30 day 5 halflives enrollment , whichever long</criteria>
