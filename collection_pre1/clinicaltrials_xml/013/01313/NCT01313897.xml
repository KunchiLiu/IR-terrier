	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine therapeutic efficacy exp-NK cell therapy research participant relapse high risk MM [ define gene expression profile ( GEP ) 70 gene score ≥0.66 and/or metaphase chromosomal abnormality and/or high LDH ≥ 360U/L ] establishing ( near ) complete response rate . Response rate compare case match historical control ( patient relapse Total Therapy 2 3 high-risk MM define ) . Disease-free survival overall survival capture primary secondary endpoint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use auto-exp-NK cell protocol make therapy available refractory high risk MM patient , 2/3 would otherwise suitable haploidentical donor . We show NK cell expand newly diagnose high risk MM patient refractory , previously heavily treated patient , individual need novel therapy exp-NK cell infusion . Furthermore , observe exp-NK cell ability kill auto-MM cell vitro compare kill rest auto-NK cell . This may due elevate activation state exp-NK cell , allow overcome otherwise dominant inhibitory signal . The incorporation proteasome inhibitor bortezomib , regulate principal NK cell inhibitory ligands MM cell increase efficacy auto-exp-NK cell . Because risk GvHD , CD3+ T cell depletion necessary auto-exp-NK cell product .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient ( Recipient NK Cells ) Inclusion Criteria Relapsed patient must high risk disease define GEP risk score ≥ 0.66 metaphase cytogenetic abnormality LDH ≥ 360 U/L ( Rule hemolysis , infection contact PI clarification doubt ) Patients must least 1 line prior chemotherapy and/or relapse auto PBSCT . For subject prior transplant , ≥2 month must relapse last transplant prior enrollment . Zubrod ≤ 2 , unless solely due symptom MMrelated ( bone ) disease . Patients must platelet count ≥ 50,000/µL within 35 day registration , unless low level explain extensive bone marrow plasmacytosis extensive prior therapy . Patients must least 18 year age old 75 year age time registration . Participants must preserve renal function define serum creatinine level ≤ 3 mg/dL within 35 day registration . Participants must ejection fraction ECHO MUGA scan ≥ 40 % within 90 day prior registration . Patients must adequate pulmonary function study &gt; 50 % predict mechanical aspect ( FEV1 , FVC , etc ) diffusion capacity ( DLCO ) &gt; 50 % predict within 90 day prior registration . If patient unable complete pulmonary function test due MM relate pain condition , exception may grant principal investigator document patient candidate high dose therapy . Patients must sign IRBapproved informed consent HIPAA authorization form . Either haploidentical family donor fit undergo leukapheresis available recipient fit undergo leukapheresis expNK cell generation ( see donor selection ) . Patient ( Recipient NK Cells ) Exclusion criterion History poorly control hypertension , diabetes mellitus , serious medical illness psychiatric illness could potentially interfere completion treatment accord protocol could consider exclusion criterion deem PI . Patients must prior malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient receive treatment one year prior enrollment . Other cancer acceptable patient 's life expectancy exceed three year determine PI . Pregnant nursing woman may participate . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy document within one week registration . Women/men reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method . Donor Inclusion Criteria The source NK cell either A ) family member HLA haploidentical recipient , B ) suitable haploidentical donor available , recipient may source NK cell . HLA type perform Arkansas Children 's Hospital clinical laboratory . If recipient express HLAC group I , HLAC group II , Bw4 KIR ligands , KIRligand mismatch haploidentical donor find , recipient source NK cell . If recipient fail express one primary KIR ligand ( HLAC group I , HLAC group II , Bw4 ) family member donor HLA type effort find haploidentical donor . If multiple haploidentical donor available , KIR phenotyping perform Dr. van Rhee 's research laboratory select KIR mismatch donor whenever possible . Donor selection perform PI one MD coinvestigators Dr. van Rhee available . Signed IRB approve consent HIPAA authorization form . Donor HIV I/II ( + ) . Donor HTLVI/II ( + ) . Donor Hepatitis B C ( + ) unless positive due previous vaccination receive therapy negative Hepatitis B C RTPCR . Donor suitable candidate insertion apheresis catheter . Donors unusual anatomy vascular anomaly prevent insertion pheresis catheter reject . Age 18 year great sign Assent age ≥16 year . Donor negative pregnancy test serum urine test . In preparation peripheral blood mononuclear cell donation , donor undergo detail medical history physical examination . Clinical study include blood chemistry ( electrolyte , liver function CRP ) CBC differential platelet , PT/PTT , viral panel , EKG ( age 40 yr ) , chest xray ( age 40yrs ) . Fitness donate cell NK expansion evaluate physician involved initial assessment expNK cell recipient enrollment onto protocol . Serologic evaluation use assess exposure syphilis , West Nile Virus , Chagas , CMV IgG , hepatitis B , C , HIV I II , HTLV I/II . An HIVI/II [ + ] HTLV1/II ( + ) donor reject medical ground . Donors vaccinate hepatitis B antibodies hepatitis B surface antigen allow . Haploidentical donor must prior malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient receive treatment one year prior donation . Patient ( Recipient NK Cells ) Exclusion criterion History poorly control hypertension , diabetes mellitus , serious medical illness psychiatric illness could potentially interfere completion treatment accord protocol could consider exclusion criterion deem PI . Patients must prior malignancy , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient receive treatment one year prior enrollment . Other cancer acceptable patient 's life expectancy exceed three year determine PI . Pregnant nursing woman may participate . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy document within one week registration . Women/men reproductive potential may participate unless agree use effective contraceptive method .</criteria>
