	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effect Fluticasone Furoate/Vilanterol Survival Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite potential link pathogenetic mechanism involve Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease , currently approve therapy patient COPD clearly show additional beneficial effect patient cardiovascular comorbidities . The TOwards Revolution COPD Health ( TORCH ) study assess impact inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) fluticasone propionate ( FP ) combination long-acting beta agonist ( LABA ) , salmeterol ( SAL ) , reduce all-cause mortality . TORCH demonstrate 17.5 % reduction all-cause mortality salmeterol-fluticasone propionate combination ( SFC ) compare placebo ( HR=0.825 , 95 % CI ( 0.681 , 1.002 ) , p=0.052 ) entire COPD population disease severity form moderate severe . A post hoc analysis data restrict subject force expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) &gt; =50 % predicted apparent history cardiovascular co-morbidities ( define use baseline beta-blockers , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEI ) /angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) , HMG CoA reductase inhibitor ( i.e . statin ) prior MI record baseline ) demonstrate 49 % reduction risk die within 96 week comparison SFC placebo . These post hoc data suggest possibility ICS/LABA combination product substantial benefit COPD subject less severe airflow obstruction yet increase cardiovascular risk . The mechanism SFC appear associate great reduction mortality less severe COPD subject concomitant cardiovascular comorbidities speculative present , could potentially part related lessening degree inflammation systemic circulation , potential plaque stabilization and/or amelioration arterial stiffness . ICS/LABA combination currently available require twice daily administration . A daily ICS/LABA combination potential improve patient compliance result , overall disease management . The purpose study prospectively evaluate effect daily ICS/LABA combination Fluticasone Furoate ( FF ) /Vilanterol ( VI ) survival subject moderate COPD ( &gt; =50 = &lt; 70 % predict FEV1 ) history , increase risk cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
