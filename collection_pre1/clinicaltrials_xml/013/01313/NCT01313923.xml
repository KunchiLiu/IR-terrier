	<brief_summary>The purpose research study alternative treatment skin disease pemphigus ( rare autoimmune blister disorder skin ) use sirolimus , immunosuppressive drug . Immunosuppressive drug inhibit prevent activity immune system commonly use treat autoimmune disease , inflammatory disease , organ transplantation rejection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Sirolimus Treat Autoimmune Blistering Dermatosis Pemphigus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study explore new medication skin disease term pemphigus . Our specific aim determine whether use sirolimus allow decrease dosage possibly eliminate need corticosteroid , far type drug control disease . Pemphigus autoimmune disease characterize blistering , cause autoantibody certain cell skin . This disease commonly occur individual age 50 older , present painful shallow erosion and/or blister mouth and/or skin . Pemphigus painful uncomfortable , associate impaired quality life significant morbidity . Severe untreated case pemphigus become fatal involved surface area become large enough cause dehydration and/or infection . The first line therapy , standard care , pemphigus remain systemic corticosteroid . However , corticosteroid many know side effect , especially use long time . Many case pemphigus insufficiently control corticosteroid alone require addition immunosuppressive agent , azathioprine , cyclophosphamide , mycophenolate mofetil , variety therapy use off-label . All treatment always successful undesirable side effect , include increase risk malignancy infection . Although treatment offer relief disease , also often cause many side effect . Sirolimus ( formerly know rapamycin ) drug commonly use renal transplant prevent organ rejection . In study , pemphigus subject active disease begin take sirolimus conjunction corticosteroid , use similar regimen use organ transplantation treat pemphigus . While increase sirolimus decreasing corticosteroid , subject monitor 12 month period evaluate disease response . The purpose study observe data trend . Our specific aim determine whether use sirolimus allow decrease dosage corticosteroid prednisone , far type drug control diseases , without make pemphigus worse .</detailed_description>
