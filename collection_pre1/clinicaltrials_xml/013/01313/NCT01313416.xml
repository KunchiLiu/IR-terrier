	<brief_summary>Background : - In 2009 , 49,096 patient diagnosed pancreatic cancer . Pancreatic cancer carry poor prognosis overall 5-year relative survival rate 5.6 % . - Many doctor believe individual surgery remove pancreatic cancer receive additional treatment , know adjuvant therapy adjuvant treatment , prevent cancer return . One chemotherapy drug find effective patient pancreatic cancer call gemcitabine ; show improve patient survival 6 month . Researchers search new drug drug combination improve result . - One leading cause immune suppression cancer patient suggest associate elevated expression program cell death ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) human B7 homolog 1 ( B7-H1 ) tumor-involved site , either tumor surround cell like regulatory immune cell , result local suppression apoptosis tumor infiltrate effector lymphocyte . - Some chemotherapy drug kill cancer cell directly , appear prevent immune system help fight . The experimental drug CT-011 design help immune system remain active fight cancer cell . CT-011 test laboratory study use number cancer , give combination gemcitabine treatment pancreatic cancer . Objective : - To test safety effectiveness chemotherapy drug gemcitabine CT-011 follow-up treatment pancreatic cancer surgically remove . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age surgery remove pancreatic cancer type follow-up treatment . Design : - Participants receive gemcitabine CT-011 28-day cycle treatment , monitor throughout treatment . - Participants serious side effect remain cancer-free may receive drug combination every 28 day total 6 cycle . - Participants follow-up visit additional blood test every 2 month stop treatment 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : - CT-011 humanized immunoglobulin G 1 ( IgG1 ) kappa recombinant monoclonal antibody PD-1 receptor block interaction PD-L1 PD-1 . CT-011 specifically bind epitope share murine human PD-1 receptor activate T cell , B cell , natural killer ( NK ) cell , myeloid cell ( CD14+ cell ) primarily function effector/memory T lymphocytes NK cell . In functional bioassay , CT-011 demonstrate block activity PD-1 operate CD4+CD45RO+ effector/memory T lymphocytes lead attenuation apoptotic process . - CT-011 studied experimental murine tumor model melanoma , lung cancer , fibrosarcoma , leukemia/lymphoma colorectal carcinoma show inhibit tumor growth extend survival tumor-bearing nude mouse , generate tumor-specific protection tumor re-challenge . - Recent finding demonstrate chemotherapy like paclitaxel , etoposide fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) induce expression PD-L1 tumor cell line lead immune-suppressive environment promote PD-L1-mediated T cell apoptosis The study conduct optimal two-stage phase II trial , order rule unacceptably low 50 % patient receive full dose CT-011 ( p0=0.50 ) favor modestly high 80 % fraction receive full dose CT-011 ( p1=0.80 ) . It anticipate 32 patient may enrol onto trial . OBJECTIVES : - Primary endpoint : To determine feasibility safety combination CT-011 Gemcitabine patient primary macroscopic resection pancreatic carcinoma . - Secondary endpoint : To determine addition CT-011 Gemcitabine improve median disease-free survival resect pancreatic cancer . DESIGN : - Eligible subject screen full medical history physical examination , blood urine test , image study . - Participants receive adjuvant combination CT-011 Gemcitabine 28-day cycle . - CT-011 give dose 3mg/kg intravenous infusion 2 hour day 1 , one week prior first Gemcitabine infusion cycle . - Gemcitabine give dose 1000mg/m^2 intravenous infusion 30 minute Days 8 , 15 22 cycle . - Treatment continue total 6 cycle disease recurrence grade IV non-hematological toxicity occur completion 6 cycle . - Participants monitor frequent blood urine test throughout treatment visit . Every cycle ( every 2 month ) , participant also image study evaluate experimental treatment . - Participants follow-up visit additional blood test every 2 month stop treatment 2 year .</detailed_description>
