	<brief_summary>This Phase II , randomize , open-label , multi-center study advance ( Stage IVA IVB subject per International Association Study Lung Cancer ( IASLC ) 2009 Lung cancer stag schema ) non-squamous NSCLC subject compare pazopanib relative pemetrexed maintenance setting . Subjects complete 4-6 cycle induction therapy carboplatin + pemetrexed cisplatin + pemetrexed Stable Disease ( SD ) , Partial Response ( PR ) Complete Response ( CR ) best response enrol study . The primary objective estimate hazard ratio progression free survival ( PFS ) advance NSCLC subject give maintenance therapy pazopanib ( Arm A ) relative pemetrexed ( Arm B ) . The secondary objective : overall survival , response rate , safety tolerability . A total approximately 200 subject enrol randomized 1:1 ratio . Safety efficacy assessment regularly perform subject .</brief_summary>
