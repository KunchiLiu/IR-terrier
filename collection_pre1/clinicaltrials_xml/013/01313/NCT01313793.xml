	<detailed_description>A bioequivalence ( BE ) study two formulation PF-00299804 .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Healthy subject include male age 18 55 year and/or female non childbearing potential age 18 55 year . ( Healthy define clinically relevant abnormality identify detailed medical history , full physical examination , include blood pressure pulse rate measurement , 12 lead ECG clinical laboratory test ) . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 17.5 30.5 kg/m2 ; total body weight &gt; 50 kg ( 110 lb ) . An informed consent document sign date subject . Subjects willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . Evidence history clinically significant dermatologic , hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurologic , allergic disease ( include drug allergy , exclude untreated , asymptomatic , seasonal allergy time dose ) . Any condition possibly affect drug absorption ( eg , gastrectomy ) . A positive urine drug screen . Use tobacco nicotine containing product ( positive urine drug cotinine test ) . History regular alcohol consumption exceed 14 drinks/week female 21 drinks/week men ( 1 drink = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) hard liquor ) within 6 month screen . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day ( determined local requirement ) 5 half life precede first dose study medication . 12 lead ECG demonstrate QTc &gt; 450 msec QRS interval &gt; 120 msec Screening . If QTc exceed 450 msec , QRS exceed 120 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTc QRS value use determine subject 's eligibility . Pregnant nursing female females childbearing potential include tubal ligation . To consider enrollment , woman 45 55 year age postmenopausal ( define amenorrheic least 2 year ) must confirmatory FSH test result Screening . Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement within 7 day 5 half life ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication . Herbal supplement hormone replacement therapy must discontinue least 28 day prior first dose study medication . Depo Provera must discontinue least 6 month prior first dose study medication . As exception , acetaminophen/paracetamol may use dos less 1 g/day . Limited use non prescription medication believe affect subject safety overall result study may permit casebycase basis follow approval sponsor . Blood donation ( exclude plasma donation ) approximately 1 pint ( 500 mL ) within 56 day prior dose . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . Unwilling unable comply Lifestyle Guidelines describe protocol . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry study .</criteria>
