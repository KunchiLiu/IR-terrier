	<brief_summary>Background : - Gastrointestinal cancer occur throat , stomach , gallbladder , liver , pancreas , colon . Researchers interested evaluate active immune system try fight cancer study blood tumor tissue donate individual diagnose gastrointestinal cancer . Objectives : - To collect blood tumor sample individual diagnose gastrointestinal cancer order study immune system response cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose throat , stomach , gallbladder , liver , pancreatic , colon cancer , schedule treat National Institutes Health . Design : - The study require least one four visit National Institutes Health Clinical Center . - Participants screen physical examination medical history , provide baseline blood sample study . - Participants provide additional blood sample 2 4 month baseline sample , well final sample completion treatment protocol . - Participants provide tumor tissue sample undergo surgical procedure relate treatment gastrointestinal cancer . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Numerous recent therapeutic advance change standard treatment option patient GI cancer . These include new chemotherapeutic agent addition establish proof principle anti-angiogenic agent . The burden GI cancer reflect presence three GI cancer type top five cause cancer mortality . Over 58,000 death yearly attribute GI cancer . - While immune-based therapy GI cancer experimental current time , gather body literature suggestive enormous potential , either alone , likely combination standard chemotherapy . - Before immunotherapy combine non-immune base treatment option first need investigate effect non-immune base therapy immune response ( especially immune-evasive mechanism ) cancer . - Commensal gut microbiota play important role colonic inflammation colon cancer . The human gut flora consist approximately 100 trillion microbial cell , disruption lead many type disease include inflammatory bowel disease colorectal cancer . Recent study show colon cancer patient well patient gastrointestinal cancer alter gut flora compare healthy control . As example , intestinal microbiome show contribute start progression certain kind liver disease NAFLD well end-stage liver diseases1-3 Therefore , important investigate gut affect patient response chemotherapy , type cancer therapy tumor growth general . OBJECTIVES : - To collect blood and/or tumor sample , include pleural peritoneal fluid , patient gastrointestinal ( GI ) cancer review Medical Oncology Branch perform analysis immune subset regard function modulate therapy . Also collect patient non-GI cancer comparison . - To identify new immune suppressor mechanism - To collect blood sample patient GI cancer also age-matched healthy control exploratory quantitative qualitative analysis circulate tumor cell ( CTC assay ) sequence 250 gene circulate tumor cell PBMC . - To study change microbiome time patient GI cancer correlate change outcome and/or immune parameter . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients undergoing evaluation participation NCI treatment protocol NCI intramural program diagnosis cancer . - 18 year age old . DESIGN : - Blood and/or tumor sample may collect consent subject initial visit and/or follow-up visit . - Analysis immune function perform baseline , subsequent visit , follow NIH , two additional time point patient return follow-up , end therapy . - Blood also obtain patient healthy control CTC analysis . - Stool sample obtain determine intestinal microbiome .</detailed_description>
