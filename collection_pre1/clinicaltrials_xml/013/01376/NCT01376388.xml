Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion screen visit ( Visit 1 ) enter 7-14 day run-in period . The run-in period provide completion baseline safety evaluation obtain baseline measure COPD status . Cardiovascular medical history/risk factor assess baseline . The following information collect subject receive study medication record eCRF : demography ( include gender , ethnic origin date birth , height , weight ) , medical history ( include duration COPD smoke history ) , COPD exacerbation assessment ( documented history â‰¥1 COPD exacerbation require antibiotics/systemic corticosteroid hospitalization past 12 month ) , concurrent medical condition , concomitant medication . At Visit 2 , eligible subject start take GSK573719/GW642444 125/25 mcg , enter treatment period . This treatment deliver via Novel Dry Powder Inhaler ( nDPI ) daily morning 52 week .

A subject consider complete study upon completion last on-treatment visit ( Visit 8 ) . At end treatment period , subject prescribe appropriate COPD medication investigator 's discretion . Primary endpoint incidence severity adverse event . Secondary endpoint clinical laboratory test ( hematology , clinical chemistry ) , change baseline vital sign ( pulse rate systolic diastolic pressure ) , 12-lead Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) assessment . And endpoint change baseline trough Forced Expiratory Volume One Second ( FEV1 ) Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) , number puff supplemental use salbutamol , percentage rescue-free day , percentage symptom-free day , mean symptom score , incidence COPD exacerbation , COPD device preference questionnaire .</detailed_description>
