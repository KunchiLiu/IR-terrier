	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform early phase clinical trial assess safety clinical toxicity immunization , well establish optimal biological dose ( OBD ) combination vaccine n-muramyldipeptide derivative ( nor-MDP ) adjuvant emulsify Montanide ( ISA 720 ) . II . To establish whether OBD two combination vaccine achieve . III . To measure humoral cellular immune response include specificity , class kinetics anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 ( HER-2 ) peptide . IV . To evaluate whether combination HER-2 epitopes show therapeutic benefit , provide synergistic and/or additive effect enumerate mechanisms action . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect analyze post-immune serum peripheral blood cell additional six month post last injection . II . To document clinical response may occur . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive HER2/neu peptide vaccine comprise measles virus epitope MVF-HER-2 ( 266-296 ) MVF-HER-2 ( 597-626 ) emulsify nor-MDP ISA 720 intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . OUTLINE : EXTENSION TRIAL AT OBD The dose-escalation ( 4 cohort ) successfully complete accrual 24 patient Optimum biological dose ( OBD ) determine dose cohort level 2 . The next phase study progress directly extension trial OBD . 12 patient accrue level . The extension cohort open HER-2 and/or EGFR overexpressing cancer . Patients ( gastrointestinal , ovarian breast must receive three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen last two year standard therapy . Patients ( breast , ovarian gastrointestinal cancer ) must receive three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen last two year standard therapy .</detailed_description>
