	<brief_summary>This protocol correspond open-label national phase II , multicenter , assess efficacy ( term response rate CR ) toxicity bendamustine , bortezomib prednisone ( BVP ) 60 patient newly diagnose MM . Patients absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity receive 9 cycle BVP . The patient eligible autologous transplant receive four cycle BVP , hematopoietic stem cell collection administration two cycle BVP follow autologous transplant . In addition overall response rate , also analyzed time progression ( TTP ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival . Finally , result compare BVP obtain 120 patient include protocol VMP GEM10MAS65 . Patients evaluate scheduled visit 3 period study : pretreatment , treatment monitoring .</brief_summary>
