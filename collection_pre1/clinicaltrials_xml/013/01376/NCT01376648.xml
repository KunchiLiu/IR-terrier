	<detailed_description>Twenty consecutive patient Graves'-caused hyperthyroidism newly diagnose untreated studied Endocrine Department Huashan Hospital , Fudan University . All subject screen examined two senior investigator . Putative BAT activity determine integrate 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) PET-CT. After first PET scan , hyperthyroid patient treat Methimazole follow clinical guideline . None use beta adrenergic blockade . The initial dose methimazole employ 10mg thrice day . During follow-up , thyroid hormone level ( free triiodothyronine free thyroxine ) measure every twenty day . The PET-CT scan assessment repeat symptom disappear thyroid hormone level return normal range . Then dose methimazole adjust accordingly .</detailed_description>
