	<brief_title>Characteristics That Identify Exacerbation Risk Following Colds COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Protocol Biomarkers clinical characteristic identify risk exacerbation follow viral upper respiratory tract infection COPD patient Chief Investigator : Dr Patrick Mallia Co-investigators : Professor Sebastian Johnston Dr Sarah Elkin Study Site The study take place St Mary 's Hospital , London - part Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust . 1 . Background COPD exacerbation major cause health care cost , morbidity mortality . Current therapy partially effective considerable side effect new treatment urgently need . 40 - 50 % COPD exacerbation associate virus infection commonest virus detect rhinovirus influenza1,2 . Sensitive rapid diagnostic technique viral infection recently become available3 drug effective rhinovirus influenza developed4 , make antiviral therapy realistic potential treatment option COPD exacerbation . However understanding relationship viral infection COPD exacerbation remain limited information require trial antiviral therapy carry . An experimental model COPD exacerbation We develop model COPD exacerbation use experimental rhinovirus infection COPD patient allow u study number outcome carefully control manner possible naturally occur infections5,6 . This model provide novel data regard relationship virus infection exacerbation . Following rhinovirus infection subject develop symptom upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) commence day 2 post-inoculation peak day 4 , follow typical low respiratory tract symptom acute exacerbation commence day 5 peak day 9 . Airflow obstruction low airway inflammation also peak day 9 . Maximum virus load occur day 4 nasal lavage day 5 sputum . In naturally occur exacerbation patient present 3-4 day onset exacerbation symptoms7 data show peak virus replication likely already occurred time . Therefore intervention antiviral drug time exacerbation may late . 63 % COPD subject study develop bacterial infection follow experimental rhinovirus infection . While virus load peak day 5 bacterial infection occur late day 12 15 post-inoculation , suggest rhinovirus infection increase susceptibility bacterial infection . Therefore treatment viral infection may additional benefit reduce secondary bacterial infection . Predicting risk exacerbation : preliminary data experimental model Data obtain experimental model allow u evaluate relationship marker time initial URTI measure subsequent exacerbation severity . Peak upper respiratory symptom correlate peak low respiratory score ( p=0.0037 , r=0.58 ) , sputum inflammatory cell count ( p=0.018 , r=0.5 ) sputum virus load ( p=0.014 , r=0.51 ) . The fall peak expiratory flow day 5 correlate peak lower respiratory score ( p=0.023 , r=-0.47 ) , breathlessness score ( p=0.0079 , r=-0.54 ) sputum virus load ( p=0.03 , r=-0.45 ) . Blood neutrophils day 5 correlate peak fall FEV1 ( p=0.0072 , r=-0.55 ) , total leukocyte count day 5 peak fall FEV1/FVC ( p=0.04 , r=-0.43 ) nasal lavage virus load day 5 correlate peak fall FEV1 ( p=0.0186 , r=-0.49 ) . These data suggest parameter symptom , airflow obstruction , peripheral leukocyte count virus load measure URTI COPD patient correlate subsequent low respiratory symptom , airflow obstruction airway inflammation could predict risk exacerbation . However study small number patient mild-moderate COPD finding need explore large cohort patient wider range COPD severity naturally-occurring infection . Biomarkers Exacerbations define increase symptoms diagnosis depend subjective assessment symptom patient health care provider . No marker - either biological physiological - exist use define exacerbation . Exacerbations associate airways inflammation direct measurement inflammatory marker difficult bronchoalveolar lavage endobronchial biopsy invasive , sputum exhale breath condensate complex time-consuming practical routine clinical practice . Blood easily obtainable measurement biomarkers establish systemic marker reflect airway inflammation correlate clinical outcome COPD exacerbation . Nasal sample also easy obtain data show nasal inflammatory marker correlate low airway inflammation8 report IL-8 IL-6 elevate nasal lavage follow experimental rhinovirus infection5 . A number biomarkers investigate marker COPD exacerbation indicator specific aetiology . Copeptin9 serum amyloid A ( SAA ) 10 correlate clinical outcome COPD exacerbation , interferon-induced protein-10 ( IP-10 ) 11 neopterin identify potential marker viral respiratory infections12,13 procalcitonin marker bacterial infection14 . However none marker investigate specifically predictor outcomes follow URTI COPD . Relationship viral URTI COPD exacerbation Data study suggest treatment time initial URTI may require prevent virus-induced exacerbation . However strategy risk treat URTIs progress exacerbation result over-treatment . Only one study examine exacerbation follow URTIs COPD patient find 43 % URTIs follow exacerbations15 . However study URTIs identify retrospectively symptom diary card therefore proven symptom cause viral infection . Up 75 % COPD patient complain upper respiratory symptom clinically stable16 upper respiratory symptom cause factor viral infection would weaken association URTI COPD exacerbation study . The true association likely higher determined virological confirmation infection . Also risk exacerbation follow viral URTI may COPD patient may influence host factor FEV1 , previous exacerbation history smoking status . Currently data available regard factor may influence risk exacerbation follow viral URTI . All study date COPD exacerbation recruit patient present symptom exacerbation . Therefore opportunity investigate relationship precede URTI exacerbation miss . The aim study recruit cohort COPD patient investigate develop URTI relationship subsequent exacerbation examine prospective manner . 2 ) Study Aims 1 . To establish proportion URTIs confirm viral aetiology COPD patient progress acute exacerbation determine specific viral aetiology . 2 . To identify clinical , viral biological marker predict progression URTI exacerbation correlate exacerbation severity . 3 . To determine baseline clinical characteristic identify patient high risk develop exacerbation follow viral URTI . 4 . To determine frequency , risk factor , bacterial infection follow viral URTI COPD patient . 5 . To develop model combine baseline patient characteristic , clinical measurement biomarkers predict exacerbation risk follow viral URTI COPD patient . 3 ) Methods Study subject A cohort 100 COPD subject recruit Chest Allergy clinic St Mary 's Hospital , Paddington part Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust community clinic within local area Westminster Kensington Chelsea . Inclusion Criteria The principal inclusion criterion patient 40-85 year old diagnosis COPD confirm spirometry . Exclusion Criteria - Participants difficulty understand English would able answer symptom questionnaire . - Participants another medical condition advance cancer mean life expectancy le 2 year would able complete follow-up . - Participants would find difficult attend frequent visit hospital also exclude . Baseline visit Following informed consent participant baseline visit detailed clinical characterisation include documentation smoking status , co-morbidities , exacerbation frequency medication measurement lung function ( FEV1 , FVC , FEV1 , /FVC , PEF , transfer coefficient ) . Sputum , nasal fluid blood collect baseline assessment bacterial viral colonisation measurement airways inflammation biomarkers . During course study participant repeat visit assessment sample carry every 3 month . The purpose document change clinical status ( e.g . change smoke status ) ensure cold/exacerbation occur stable visit compare parameter within last 3 month . Following baseline visit participant commence record low respiratory symptom use Exacerbations Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool ( EXACT ) , new patient-reported outcome diary validate COPD cohort studies17 . They continue usual medication medical care advise contact investigator develop symptom cold exacerbation . They contact telephone weekly attempt identify episode increase respiratory symptom . Cold visit Subjects advise report investigator develop symptom URTI . When occur see within 24 hour 'cold visit ' - detail visit show . URTI symptom quantify use Wisconsin Upper Respiratory Symptom Survey ( WURSS-21 ) 18 questionnaire . The WURSS-21 quality life assessment measure health-related effect common cold use predict exacerbation follow URTI asthmatics19 . To obtain WURSS-21 score COPD subject without cold subgroup stable subject administer WURSS-21 14 consecutive day . FEV1 , FVC , FEV1 , /FVC PEF measure sample nasal fluid , induced sputum blood collect . All subject see 7 day cold visit repeat sample unless develop exacerbation prior . As exacerbation define symptom symptom perception subjective purpose visit measure objective marker lung function inflammatory marker clinical sample collect . Comparing participant report exacerbation provide objective evidence exacerbation occur addition symptom . Exacerbation visit When subject develop URTI monitor symptom subsequent exacerbation occur visit term 'exacerbation visit ' . If participant develop exacerbation without precede URTI also see . Clinical assessment include physical examination , symptom score spirometry carry evaluate exacerbation severity clinical sample cold visit collect . Subjects visit 2 6 week exacerbation onset repeat assessment clinical sampling . Milestones COPD patient average 1-2 cold per year recruit cohort 100 subject follow 24 month include 4 season peak rhinovirus activity provide least 200 episode URTI evaluate . We require 6 month complete laboratory analysis analyse data . 4 ) Study Procedures Throat swab A sterile dry cotton-headed swab use obtain sample pharynx virus detection . This perform subject sit .
