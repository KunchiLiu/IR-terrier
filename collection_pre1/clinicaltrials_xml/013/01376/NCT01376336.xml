	<brief_summary>Environmental health-related pathogen include faecal-oral , diarrhoeagenic microbe may transmit via drinking water relate sanitation hygiene . Previous research suggest safeguard household drinking water recontamination may critical intervention reduce risk diarrheal disease may especially important people live HIV/AIDS ( PLWHA ) vulnerable population ( Clasen et al . 2007 ) . The investigator propose randomise , control trial household safe storage container drinking water well define , HIV-impacted population peri-urban Lusaka , Zambia . After baseline data collection period ( 9 month ) half household ( 150 household ) give safe water storage container specifically design prevent recontamination water household use .

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim # 1 : To assess environmental health-related risk outcome low income peri-urban area Zambia high percentage people live HIV/AIDS ( PLWHA ) ( longitudinal observational cohort study baseline ) ( Year 1 ) . We assemble rich dataset environmental health-related risk factor well define population , focus household drinking water quality water , sanitation , hygiene ( WSH ) exposures . Specific Aim # 2 : To quantify WSH-related disease burden among PLWHA , compare without HIV/AIDS ( individual household level stratification ) ( conclusion baseline ) . After nine month data collection , perform initial analysis determine WSH-related risk HIV status . Specific Aim # 3 : To assess impact water quality intervention longitudinal prevalence Highly Credible Gastrointestinal Illness ( HCGI ) among PLWHA ( randomize control trial , year 2 ) . We conduct randomise , control trial safe water storage intervention . We assess health impact intervention , particular focus high-risk group PLWHA child 5 year age .</detailed_description>
