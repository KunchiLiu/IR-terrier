	<brief_summary>The economic cost asthma considerable term direct medical cost ( cost pharmaceutical hospital admission ) indirect medical cost ( time lose work premature death ) . The cost asthma depend severity disease extent exacerbation avoid . Moreover , poor control asthma symptom major issue result adverse clinical economic outcome . According GINA guideline , goal asthma treatment achieve maintain asthma control . Such objective reach majority patient pharmacologic intervention strategy develop partnership patient/family doctor . Validated measure assess asthma control score goal continuous variable provide numerical value distinguish different level control . Among , Asthma Control Test ( TM - QualityMetric Incorporated ) widely recognize . Few data exist relationship asthma control health care consumption . Some model predict asthma cost propose . However , model attempt assess cost associate medication and/or asthma exacerbation . Furthermore , study , asthma control define accordingly current international criterion . Considering increase interest health authority reduce asthma associate cost improve quality care , appear necessary study relationship cost level control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European Cost Asthma Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A European observational retrospective bottom-up cost illness study design base upon sample patient asthma . Investigators general practitioner . They enrol sample patient asthma . The level asthma control evaluate 2 method : - Firstly use auto-test Asthma Control Test ( TM - QualityMetric Incorporated ) allow assess level control 4-week period distinguish control uncontrolled patient ; - Secondly use GINA 's asthma control criterion measure level control last 3 month . The GINA classification allow range patient 3 group ( control , partly control uncontrolled patient ) comprise measure lung function use peak expiratory flow measurement ( PEF ) spirometric examination . The study design necessitate one visit per patient retrospective data collection three-month period . This period maximum possible retrospective duration avoid memory bias . A questionnaire filled-up general practitioner . Data collect visit demographic data , medical history patient , physician paramedic 's visit , treatment , diagnosis lab test , hospitalization , rehabilitation , absence work last three month . A PEF spirometric result also request . Patients complete Asthma Control test ( TM - QualityMetric Incorporated ) questionnaire . To assess quality life , patient also complete EQ-5D questionnaire . As time horizon asthma control concept one month shorter , cost analysis first do take account duration ( cost compare Asthma Control Test ( TM - QualityMetric Incorporated ) score ) , secondly , three month period ( cost compare GINA 's criterion ) . To take account seasonality , overall population patient enrol four quarterly wave . The data collection therefore require one full year . All data collect centralized , captured analyze . Costing do use societal payer perspective without discount . Results provide period asthma control level accord patient profile ( age , sex , etc. ) . The number patient need enrol calculated take account precision average cost estimate lower size group ( i.e patient optimal control ) period country . In country , least 380 patient enrol per wave obtain total population 152 patient optimal control . Overall , 3,040 enrol study year .</detailed_description>
