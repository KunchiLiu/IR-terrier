	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Erchonia® ML Scanner ( MLS ) low level light laser device help reduce circumference upper arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Effect Low Level Laser Light Therapy Reducing Upper Arm Circumference</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper arm body contour design remove excess skin and/or fatty tissue upper arm . Cosmetic procedure grow prevalence , upper arm body contour procedure increase 4059 % 2000 2008 , 2009 , 16,100 upper arm lift perform United States ( U.S. ) . Currently available procedure reduce upper arm circumference include brachioplasty ( arm lift ) , surgical procedure remove excess skin fatty tissue upper arm ; liposuction localize fatty deposit upper arm ; diet exercise reduce excess body fat . Both brachioplasty liposuction surgical procedure risk potential complication include trauma ; fluid accumulation requiring drainage ; injury skin ; infection ; permanent scar ; complication anesthesia . Low level laser light therapy offer safe , non-invasive essentially risk-free alternative reduce upper arm circumference . The device evaluate reduction upper arm circumference , Erchonia ML Scanner ( MLS ) clear Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) K082609 `` ... use non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment reduction circumference hip , waist , thigh . '' Furthermore , FDA identify generic type device : `` A Low Level Laser System Aesthetic Use device use low level laser energy disruption adipocyte cell within fat layer release fat lipid cell non-invasive aesthetic use . '' Therefore , biochemical effect Erchonia® MLS low level laser light therapy device stimulates mitochondria adipocyte cell turn increase production Adenosine-5'-triphosphate ( ATP ) . The newly synthesize ATP trigger up-regulation cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) . cAMP show stimulate cytoplasmic lipase , trigger conversion triglyceride fatty acid glycerol easily pas cell membrane . The transitory pore evidence laser allow movement fatty acid , glycerol , triglyceride pass across membrane extra-cellular space . Through vasodilation nearby blood vessel artery , oxidization triglyceride fatty acid occurs within extra-cellular space .</detailed_description>
