	<brief_summary>The main purpose study find maximum tolerable dose sorafenib administer along another drug call 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) find whether drug , along radiation , help people rectal cancer give surgery . 5-FU radiation approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use people rectal cancer . The investigator utilize standard 3 + 3 phase I study design . In phase I part study , investigator attempt dose escalation sorafenib combination standard infusional 5-FU external beam standard dos . Clinical stag do endorectal ultrasound ( ERUS ) and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) T N stage ; chest abdomen compute tomography ( CT ) stag metastatic disease ; undergo sigmoidoscopy and/or colonoscopy do crude odds ratio ( CORS ) ; biopsy take diagnosis extra send tissue bank . At maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) sorafenib expand cohort 6 patient evaluate toxicity profile efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre-operative 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) Sorafenib With External Radiation Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants ' study regimen include 5 ½ week radiation . Radiation session daily , Monday Friday , except holiday . 5-FU deliver dose 225 mg/m² daily catheter large vein continuously last day radiation . In addition , sorafenib take mouth twice daily every day last day radiation . The dose sorafenib participant may receive one following : 200 mg every day , 200 mg daily , 400 mg daily , 800 mg daily . Following completion phase study , participant receive study drug radiation one month . At 4 5 week stop study drug radiation , participant another CT scan MRI ass cancer . About 6 8 week end radiation , participant undergo surgery every effort make remove tumor . The surgery occur would participant study , except portion tumor obtain surgery use research biomarker test ( described consent form ) . Approximately 6 -10 week participant ' surgery , adequately heal , may receive additional chemotherapy study doctor 's discretion .</detailed_description>
