	<brief_title>Efficiency Two Occlusal Splints TMD Treatment Police Officers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After approval Human Research Ethics Committee Piracicaba Dental School register number 189/03 , 905 police officer São Paulo State - Brazil fill Axis II Research Diagnostic Criteria Temporomandibular Disorders ( RDC/TMD ) 256 volunteer select TMD symptom . Afterward volunteer submit Axis I RDC ( clinical examination ) exclude present systemic disease like fibromyalgia , arthritis , arthrosis osteoporosis , historical TMJ ( temporomandibular joint ) surgery TMD treatment , dental prosthesis , loss two posterior teeth ( except third molar teeth extract orthodontic reason ) , incomplete dentition space arch ( except third molar ) , volunteer orthodontic and/or orthopedic appliance , mandible and/or maxilla fracture , vertebra medullar canal stenosis , take anti-inflammatory , analgesic and/or muscle-relaxing drug , otologic treatment without compromise investigation . Who present myogenic mixed TMD , TMJ pain least three month joint tenderness palpation least one side invite remain study . According exclusion inclusion criterion present select 30 volunteer ( 15 woman 15 men ) , average age 29 year , diagnosis indicative myogenic mixed TMD . The volunteer randomize divided three different group 10 person per group use stratification method perform computerized table place subject different group accord occlusal splint . Group A : Not receive oral device ( Control ) ; Group B : Used Michigan Occlusal Splint ( MOS ) ; Group C : Used Planas Oral Appliance ( POA ) . Each one 30 volunteer fill Visual Analog Pain Scale ( VAPS ) evaluate muscle pain sensibility clinically examine accord Axis I RDC , always examiner , morning , four week begin experiment . OCCLUSAL SPLINTS Twenty volunteer use two different occlusal splint four week sleep . Volunteers orient communicate treatment keep unknown difference occlusal splint control group . Instrumentation Electromyographic record perform temporal , masseter suprahyoid muscle four week use occlusal splint . Volunteers remain seated , Frankfurt 's plane parallel floor , look toward front , foot floor , legs 90º angle hand rest thigh . Occlusal splint remove EMG record . All EMG record obtain Lynx Data Acquisition System ( MCS1000-V2 ) 16 channel , 12 bit resolution dynamic range , Butterworth filter , 500 Hz pas band , high pas filter 20 Hz gain 2000 time . The Software Aqdados , version 5 ( Lynx ) use , sample frequency 1000 Hz simple differential active surface electrode entrance impedance 10 ohm CMRR ( Common Mode Rejection Reason ) 80 dB , impedance 1012 ohm gain 20 time . A reference electrode position sternum bone volunteer . Surface electrodes place bilaterally masseter , temporal suprahyoid muscle , accord previous muscle palpation muscle function test . In case electrode fix previously clean skin alcohol attach double-side adhesive tape ( Castroflorio et al. , 2004 ) centre muscular belly , parallel muscle fiber silver bar perpendicular direction maximize signal capture minimize noise interference . In three different moment EMG record perform . First : 5 second muscle rest . Second : maximal voluntary contraction ( MVC ) , bite bilaterally two piece elastic cord ( no.201 ) 2.5-cm length . Third : MVC suprahyoid muscle maximal mouth opening ( MMO ) . Signals normalized mean RMS ( Root Mean Square ) three MVC measurement . Each EMG exam perform 3 minute rest physiological recovery avoid muscle fatigue .</detailed_description>
