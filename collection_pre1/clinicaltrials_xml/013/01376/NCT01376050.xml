	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether low level laser light therapy effective adjunctive therapy heal venous stasis leg ulcer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Application Low Level Laser Light Treat Venous Stasis Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A chronic venous stasis leg ulcer wound knee fails heal within 6 week . Venous stasis ulcer account 80 % 90 % leg foot ulcer , affect estimate 500,000-600,000 people United States every year . Venous stasis ulcer account loss 2 million working day incur treatment cost around $ 3 billion dollar annually United States . Standard care venous stasis ulcer include compression affect leg together daily dress change minimize swell ; debridement ulcer remove dead tissue bacteria ; daily wound Care dress keep wound clean . Venous stasis ulcer typically lengthy poor healing rate , 50 % remain open unhealed 9 month longer . Many patient suffer pain sleep mobility problem , impair quality life . Recurrence rate venous stasis ulcer high , one third treated individual experience 4 episodes ulceration . Low level laser light therapy ( LLLT ) , proven tissue heal acceleration property recently gain attention simple , non-invasive alternative adjunctive therapy assist wound closure accelerate time wound closure . Numerous histological trial exhibit laser therapy 's capacity upregulate essential wound-healing factor vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) , oxygen concentration , fibroblast proliferation , collagen synthesis , re-epithelialization , tissue granulation . Clinically , application laser therapy demonstrate promise , accelerate rate wound heal tissue contracture .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At least one venous stasis ulcer , diagnose accord differential diagnosis methodology satisfies criteria supportive ulcer 's venous origin criterion eliminate ulcer indicative nonvenous origin . Diagnostic criterion evaluate satisfaction criterion supportive venous origin ulcer involve evaluation medical history wound history variable ; physical examination affect leg ulcer site ; objective test Resting Ankle Brachial Pressure Index ( ABPI ) 0.8 great Venous Doppler ultrasound show reflux suspect vein Clinical Etiologic Anatomic Pathophysiologic ( CEAP ) Classification System Class 6 Ulcer measure 5 20cm² , inclusive , accord standardize computerized planimetry evaluation present venous leg ulcer present 6 continuous week longer Subject agrees partake form treatment ulcer throughout study participation , standard care treatment provide investigator part study protocol Satisfaction exclusive diagnostic criterion consider indicative ulcer nonvenous origin ( e.g . arterial mixed origin ) , nonvenous component . This evaluation include consideration medical history wound history variable ; examination affect leg ulcer site ; objective test measurement Resting Ankle Brachial Pressure Index ( ABPI ) less 0.8 Doppler ultrasound show absence reflux suspect vein Fasting blood glucose ( blood sugar ) level great 140 mg/dl indicative current potential diabetes Subject present factor may significantly impede delay heal chronic nonhealing wound , include know diabetes disorder glucose metabolic disease ; malnutrition ; collagen diseases EhlersDanlos syndrome ; history systematic glucocorticosteroid therapy ; history exogenous glucocorticosteroid therapy ; chemotherapeutic ( antineoplastic ) drug use Ulcer significant bacterial infection , confirm positive swab culture utilize Levine 's technique Ulcer present le 6 continuous week Ulcer CEAP Class 0 5 , inclusive Ulcer measure less 5cm² great 20cm² , accord standardize computerized planimetry evaluation Exposed bone tendon fascia General skin disorder psoriasis penicilitis Immunosuppressive disorder Hypercoagulable state Prior deep vein thrombosis Cellulites oneyear period prior study participation Vasculitis collagen vascular disease History prior venous surgery Any concomitant illness ( e ) medical condition ( ) would render subject inappropriate study ( i.e. , renal failure , liver disease , connective tissue disorder , etc . ) Active recurrent cancer currently receive chemotherapy radiation therapy Subject take regimen medication ( ) may affect wound healing , include corticosteroid , chemotherapeutic nonsteroidal antiinflammatory ( NSAID ) medication Developmental disability/significant psychological disorder could impair subject 's ability provide inform consent , participate study protocol record study measure , include schizophrenia , bipolar disorder psychiatric hospitalization within last 2 year Females currently pregnant lactate intend attempt become pregnant course intend study participation Involvement litigation/receiving disability benefit relate venous stasis ulcer ( ) .
