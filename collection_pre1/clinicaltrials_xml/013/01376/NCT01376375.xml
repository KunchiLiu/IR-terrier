	<detailed_description>Objective : Inflammation primary mechanical derangement think two major cause lead low back pain ( LBP ) syndromes . Increasing evidence suggest cytokine hormone , include IFN-gamma , IL-17 , IL-1beta , IL-6 , TNF-alpha , MMP10 , NGF , PGE2 , NO IL-8 , play critical role pathogenesis inflammatory LBP . This study investigate effect acupuncture LBP measure serum cytokine hormone level treatment participant . To define molecular mechanism acupuncture affect LBP , histone modification , include H3K4me3 H3K27me3 , well methylation pattern CpG islands promoter select gene peripheral CD4 ( plus ) T cell also test . Study Population : Five participant chronic LBP receive treatment . Design : In non-randomized , single group pilot study , participant give sham acupuncture subsequently treat acupuncture total eight visit span 17 day . Blood drawn analyze schedule interval . Outcome Measure : The primary outcome investigate potential effect acupuncture treatment , compare sham acupuncture quiet relaxation , regulation IFN-gamma IL-17 participant LBP , include serum level two cytokine , frequency CD4 ( plus ) IFN-gamma ( plus ) CD4 ( plus ) IL-17 ( plus ) cell peripheral blood , pattern H3K4me3 , H3K27me3 DNA methylation promoter CD4 ( plus ) T cell response acupuncture treatment . Secondary outcome investigate effect acupuncture , compare sham acupuncture quiet relaxation , follow outcome measure : level serum cytokine hormone , include IL-1beta , TNF-alpha , MMP10 , NGF , PGE2 , NO , IL-8 , IL-6 , TGF-beta , IL-10 , IL-22 , IL-23 IL-17F acupuncture treatment ; genome-wide gene expression profile CD4 ( plus ) T cell acupuncture treatment ; genome-wide pattern H3K4me3 H3K27me3 modification CD4 ( plus ) T cell acupuncture treatment ; genome-wide pattern H3K4me3 H3K27me3 modification CD4 ( plus ) T cell acupuncture treatment ; DNA methylation status change select CpG islands acupuncture treatment ; severity LBP two week acupuncture treatment accord Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form ( BPI-SF ) pain severity , well Randall Morris Disability Questionnaire ( RMDQ ) LBP-related interference score .</detailed_description>
