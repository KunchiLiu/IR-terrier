	<detailed_description>Basal joint arthritis thumb common condition associate considerable morbidity . Many non-operative operative treatment describe multi-center prospective evidence base trial compare standard treatment do . This continue search consensus best clinical practice review thorough meta-analysis operative treatment basal joint arthritis . Through systematic collection data regard patient-specific characteristic , treatment intervention , longitudinal functional outcome measurement investigator believe patient outcome satisfaction improve elucidation risk factor disease progression , time selection treatment modality , either conservative surgical , particular patient . The establishment multi-center clinical registry greatly facilitate goal . By establish standardized outcome measure collect data prospectively time initial presentation treatment intervention possible directly compare treatment conservative operative care basal joint arthritis thumb . This propose multi-center registry identify specific procedure conservative treatment potential study subsequent focus well-designed randomize control trial . Osteoarthritis common form arthritis second frequent cause long-term disability North America . Osteoarthritis basal joint thumb debilitate disease affect large segment adult population , although large epidemiologic study prevalence basal joint arthritis perform United States . The pathogenesis osteoarthritis remain multi-factorial researcher agree degenerative process result mechanical , biochemical , genetic factor destabilize normal balance degradation synthesis articular cartilage subchondral bone . Although excellent study randomize , prospective design show good outcome several surgical technique , still unknown procedure appropriate particular patient achieve optimal functional outcome long-term success minimal surgical trauma . Optimal immobilization type duration also know . The effect metacarpalphalangeal joint hyperextension long-term outcome optimal treatment method adjacent joint also unknown . This propose study allow prospective data collection multiple institution across country engage recognize expert , treat basal joint arthritis different clinical protocol . Millions people U.S. develop basal joint osteoarthritis , commonly affect joint upper extremity require surgical intervention . The demand efficacious cost effective form operative non-operative treatment disable disease considerable . Identifying safe effective treatment among numerous treatment modality available would likely lead significant improvement quality life large segment population . If future study show less involved reconstruction , trapeziectomy alone , effective complicate ligament reconstruction tendon interposition , many patient may benefit less complex surgery . This trial would increase clinician patient awareness confidence effective treatment regimen . This study hypothesize exist effective non-operative operative treatment certain patient population basal joint arthritis thumb . There also exist functionally superior , cost effective , low risk non-operative minimally invasive operative treatment regime alleviate pain slow progression disease less advanced disease . Likewise , significant functional , health utility , economic advantage surgically treat advanced basal joint arthritis thumb one popularized procedure currently practice .</detailed_description>
