	<brief_summary>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) common virus usually present side effect . When first infect , people may symptoms similar mononucleosis ( i.e. , fatigue , weakness , fever , swell gland ) . Most people United States infect childhood adult work around child . Pregnant woman , infect CMV past become infected pregnancy ( i.e . primary infection ) , may cause baby get infect CMV . Babies infect may develop permanent disability include hearing loss small portion die infection . Currently routine practice screen pregnant woman CMV infection . Additionally , agreement evaluate manage pregnant woman infect CMV first time . There also evidence treatment beneficial baby . The purpose research study determine whether treat pregnant woman primary CMV infection CMV antibodies reduce number baby infect CMV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Prevent Congenital Cytomegalovirus ( CMV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) common congenital infection , approximately 44,000 congenitally infected infant U.S. per year . A substantial proportion infant die suffer permanent injury result infection . The severity congenital infection great primary maternal CMV infection . Currently , proven method prevent congenital CMV infection , approach primary maternal CMV infection United States haphazard ineffective . One small , non-randomized study suggest maternal administration CMV hyperimmune globulin may significantly reduce rate congenital CMV infection follow maternal primary infection . The MFMU CMV Trial address primary research question : maternal administration CMV hyperimmune globulin lower rate congenital CMV infection among offspring woman diagnose primary CMV infection early pregnancy ? The research study fund Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institutes Child Health Human Development ( NICHD ) . Fourteen medical center across country participate research study . In , 800 pregnant woman identify primary CMV infection enrol research study . The child woman evaluate tested one two year age .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis primary maternal CMV infection basis one following : 1 . A positive CMV Immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) antibody lowavidity maternal CMV Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibody screen 2 . Evidence maternal seroconversion development CMV IgG antibody follow prior negative CMV screen Gestational age randomization later 23 week 6 day base clinical information evaluation early ultrasound ; later 27 week 6 day woman positive IgM , negative IgG initially screen 23 week rescreened 24 week evidence IgG seroconversion . Singleton pregnancy . A twin pregnancy reduce singleton ( either spontaneously therapeutically ) 14 week project gestational age acceptable . Maternal CMV infection predate pregnancy define high IgG avidity index positive IgG presence negative IgM . Known hypersensitivity plasma plasma derive product Planned termination pregnancy Known major fetal anomaly demise Maternal Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) deficiency Planned use immune globulin , ganciclovir , valganciclovir Maternal renal disease ( recent prerandomization serum creatinine â‰¥ 1.4 mg/dL ; woman must serum creatinine measure pregnancy prior randomization ) Maternal immune impairment ( e.g. , HIV infection , organ transplant antirejection medication ) Findings prerandomization ultrasound suggestive establish fetal CMV infection ( cerebral ventriculomegaly , microcephaly , cerebral intraabdominal calcification , abnormality amniotic fluid volume , echogenic bowel ascites ) . Abnormally low amniotic fluid volume define fluid prior 14 week maximum vertical pocket &lt; 2 cm 14 week gestation . Abnormally high amniotic fluid volume define &gt; 10 cm . Positive fetal CMV finding culture ( amniotic fluid ) PCR . Congenital infection rubella , syphilis , varicella , parvovirus toxoplasmosis diagnose serology ultrasound amniotic fluid test .
