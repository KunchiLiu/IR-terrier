	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety Immune Response HIV Vaccine Healthy , HIV-Uninfected Adults Who Have Participated Previous HIV Vaccine Clinical Trials Adults Who Have Not Participated Previous HIV Vaccine Clinical Trials</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous clinical trial show people receive second vaccine certain condition receive prior vaccine may better antibody response second vaccine people receive vaccine first time . This know `` prim '' may occur people receive second vaccine even first vaccine receive several year previously . This study enroll healthy , HIV-uninfected adult participate previous HIV vaccine clinical trial receive HIV-1 subtype B envelope subunit vaccine MF59 adjuvant , healthy , HIV-uninfected adult participate previous HIV vaccine clinical trial therefore previously receive HIV vaccine . Participants study receive total two injection , 6 month apart , HIV-1 Sub Cgp140 vaccine MF59 adjuvant . Researchers evaluate safety immune response study vaccine determine people participate previous HIV vaccine clinical trial demonstrate improve antibody response study vaccine versus people never receive HIV vaccine . This study enroll two group participant . Group 1 include healthy , HIV-uninfected adult participate previous HIV vaccine clinical trial . Group 2 include healthy , HIV-uninfected adult participate HIV vaccine clinical trial . All participant receive study vaccine inject upper arm baseline Month 6 . At baseline study visit , participant undergo physical examination , medical medication history review , blood collection . Female participant also take pregnancy test . Participants complete questionnaire receive counsel HIV risk reduction pregnancy prevention . Saliva sample obtain participant rectal fluid , semen sample , cervical secretion obtain participant . After receive vaccine , participant remain clinic least 30 minute observation monitor side effect . For 3 day vaccination , participant record side effect symptom log . Participants Group 1 attend study visit 1 2 week first vaccination study visit , Month 6 second vaccination , 1 2 week Month 6 study visit , Months 9 12 . Participants Group 2 attend study visit 1 3 day 1 2 week first vaccination study visit , Month 6 second vaccination , 1 3 day 1 2 week Month 6 study visit , Months 9 12 . Follow-up study visit include select study procedure . Blood collect study visit may save future test . Study researcher contact participant Month 18 follow-up health monitoring . In July 2013 , extension study announce . Current study participant screen see eligible participate study extension . Participants eligible receive one additional injection study vaccine , visit approximately 14 20 month second ( Month 6 ) vaccination . Additional study visit occur 2 week , 3 6 month receive third vaccination . Select visit include physical examination , blood collection , saliva collection , pregnancy test female participant , HIV test risk reduction counseling , interview questionnaire . Study researcher contact participant 1 year third vaccination follow-up health monitoring .</detailed_description>
