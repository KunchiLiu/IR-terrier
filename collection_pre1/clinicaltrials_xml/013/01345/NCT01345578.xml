	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether partial irradiation liver liver cell transplantation provide help patient life-threatening liver-based metabolic diseases unlikely survive without extensive medical therapy transplant . The goal research study determine liver cell transplant effective alternative organ transplantation . At present time , liver cell transplant experimental do limited number human subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Management patient hepatic failure liver-based metabolic disorder complex expensive . Hepatic failure result impaired coagulation , alter consciousness cerebral function , heighten risk multiple organ system failure , sepsis . Liver transplantation often available treatment option severe , even transient , hepatic failure . Patients life-threatening liver-based metabolic disorder similarly require organ transplantation even though metabolic disease typically result single enzyme deficiency , liver otherwise function normally . More 17,000 patient currently await liver transplantation United States , number seriously underestimate number patient need treatment , estimate million patient United States could benefit transplantation . Unfortunately , use whole liver transplantation treat disorder limit severe shortage donor risk associate major surgery . Hepatocyte transplantation hold great promise alternative organ transplantation treatment liver disease , numerous study rodent indicate transplant consist isolated liver cell correct various metabolic deficiency liver reverse hepatic failure . The transplant procedure , involve injection isolate hepatocytes liver portal vein , far less intrusive transplantation whole liver could perform severely ill patient relatively low risk . In presence normal host liver architecture , transplant cell integrate host liver , provide considerable restorative potential . Because native liver remove , transplant hepatocytes need improve function fail liver need replace hepatic function . Although clinical trial hepatocyte transplantation demonstrate long-term safety procedure , partial correction metabolic disorder achieve , degree donor hepatocytes restore fail liver adequate circumvent need organ replacement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients lifethreatening liverbased metabolic disorder candidate organ transplantation hepatocyte transplantation consider theoretically curative . In addition child subject less 18 year age , purpose protocol , adult age 21 year enrol since upper age limit patient see Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh . Patients liver base metabolic disorder theoretically treatable organ transplantation . Subjects meet follow criterion exclude participation protocol : 1 . Subject active malignancy . 2 . Subject allergy immunosuppression medication require post transplant procedure prevention rejection . 3 . Subject sepsis , pneumonia , active infection secondary lifethreatening organ dysfunction . 4 . Significant liver fibrosis determine biopsy ( clinically indicate ) . Significant liver fibrosis define Ishak Staging , Stage 5 : bridge occasional nodule . 5 . Subject pregnant breastfeeding .</criteria>
