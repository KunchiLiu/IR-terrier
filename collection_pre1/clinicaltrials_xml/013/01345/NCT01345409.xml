	<detailed_description>Substantial recent research examine efficacy biological basis many type complementary alternative ( CAM ) therapy . However , `` real-world '' use CAM largely overlook , despite call CAM therapy study manner practice urging high prioritization research include clinical outcome , cost-effectiveness , decision-making process patient provider . There , therefore , heighten need enrich understanding—particularly give CAM 's grow popularity , fortunately offer store new data research . Recent study suggest Americans seek CAM treatment far often chronic musculoskeletal pain ( CMP ) condition . Among CAM treatment CMP , acupuncture chiropractic ( A/C ) care among high acceptance physician group best evidence support use . Further , recent alarm increase delivery opioid treatment surgical intervention chronic pain—despite high cost , potential adverse effect , modest efficacy—suggests need evaluate outcome associate promising non-pharmacological/non-surgical CAM treatment CMP , often well accepted patient increasingly use community . This study respond NCCAM program announcement PAR-08-045 , `` Outcomes , Cost-Effectiveness Decision Making Process Use CAM . '' Because project consist four discrete set project activity ( largely follow one another chronologically ) , investigator plan submit separate IRQs cover set project activity follow : ( Phase1 ) Retrospective study use information EMR identify unique cluster patient CMP , trajectories care within health plan , examine unique cluster may differ propensity use A/C service and/or differential outcome associate care . The IRQ study submit ( Phase 2 ) The administration out-of-plan CAM survey determine broad sample KP member use service . ( Phase 3 ) The collection qualitative data ( focus group individual interview ) KP member , KP provider , acupuncturists chiropractor community examine KP provider decision recommend A/C service , A/C service deliver KP patient , patient ' decision pursue retain CAM care . A secondary purpose KP member CMP review plan assessment instrument phase 4 study provide feedback : relevancy , notable omission domain important patient ' decision use CAM service pain treatment broad health quality life outcomes associate CAM treatment , well review understandability assessment instrument . ( Phase 4 ) A prospective cohort study evaluate health services/costs broader clinical functional outcome associate receipt A/C relative carefully match comparison participant receive traditional CMP service .</detailed_description>
