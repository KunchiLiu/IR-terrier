	<brief_summary>This study design two component : 1 ) cross sectional assessment brain connectivity response pain healthy control demographically match fibromyalgia patient , 2 ) longitudinal assessment outcome fibromyalgia patient randomize either CBT ( Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ) Disease Education condition . The investigator evaluate 90 fibromyalgia patient receive CBT treatment week 8 week , total 8 treatment . Baseline data patient compare result 30 pain-free control 60 education program control . Participants undergo experimental pain assessment well brain neuroimaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators propose use fMRI ( functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) study CNS pain process anticipation experience acute pain individual FM healthy control . Investigators recruit patient diagnosed FM well healthy control . After baseline visit , FM participant randomly assign CBT control condition ( Education ) . Overall , FM Participants attend 8 treatment visit , 6 assessment visit ( two baseline , one mid-treatment , two end treatment , one 6 month post-treatment ) . These assessment visit include total 3 fMRI session ( baseline , mid-treatment , end treatment ) . Healthy Controls undergo baseline procedure FM subject attend treatment follow assessment visit . Findings research provide important information catastrophizing 's CNS ( Central Nervous System ) correlate .</detailed_description>
