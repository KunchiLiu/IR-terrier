No history acute respiratory disease within four week prior inclusion . No history breathe problem history asthma , unless asthma childhood completely resolve , longer require maintenance intermittent therapy . No significant medical disorder may affect respiratory system cause significant disability . Asthmatic : Cohort Clinically diagnose asthma , least 6 month , stratify either : mild , moderate severe , base current treatment , use British Thoracic Society Guidelines Asthma [ BTS , 2009 ] . For inhaled steroid equivalence budesonide please refer GINA guideline [ GINA , 2008 ] Mild , define Step 1 2 BTS Asthma Guidelines Moderate , define step 3 BTS Asthma Guidelines Severe , define step 4 5 BTS Asthma Guidelines Nonsmokers ( never smoke smoking &gt; 12 month &lt; 1 pack year history ( Pack year = ( cigarette per day smoked/20 ) x number year smoke ) ) Able withhold short act bronchodilator 6 hour long act bronchodilator 12 hour study assessment No history acute respiratory disease within four week prior inclusion .
