	<brief_summary>The first objective study evaluate treat target treatment strategy woman moderate high disease activity RA pregnancy wish , pre-pregnancy . The treatment strategy base deliberate treatment decision low disease activity , include continuation start biological treatment ( particular anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor [ anti-TNF ] ) , base standard care protocol Erasmus MC .

	<detailed_description>Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) auto-inflammatory disease particularly involve chronic inflammation joints.The disease essence systemically active one affect almost organ . Pregnancy spontaneously reduce activity RA . This phenomenon investigate PARA-study ( Pregnancy-induced Amelioration Rheumatoid Arthritis study ) , nationwide prospective cohort study initiate coordinated department Rheumatology , Erasmus University Medical Center , Rotterdam Netherlands . The PARA-study reconfirm previous data RA improve pregnancy . However , also show improvement less pronounce previously think since &gt; 50 % RA-patients still active disease third trimester pregnancy . It also demonstrate active RA associate low birth weight child mother active RA demonstrate rapid catch growth weight . Lower birth weight well rapid catch growth weight show associated less favorable cardiovascular profile early adulthood . Finally , show time pregnancy prolong RA-patients active disease . Also use prednisone &gt; 7,5 mg daily use NSAIDs ( Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs ) associate prolonged time pregnancy . These latter association independent disease activity . The finding PARA-study implicate one strive low disease activity woman RA pregnancy wish , meantime NSAIDs dose prednisone exceed 7.5 mg daily avoid . Since common drug treat RA , like methotrexate , incompatible pregnancy , lower disease activity pregnant RA-patients pregnancy wish becomes real challenge patient treat physician . This underscore importance new treatment modality RA-patients pregnancy wish . In last decade new treatment option RA , so-called biologicals , become available . During pregnancy experience gain biologicals belong class anti-TNF therapy . In USA , anti-TNF approve use pregnancy FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) class B ( i.e . Animal reproduction study fail demonstrate risk fetus , adequate , well-controlled , study pregnant woman conduct ) . Registry study show anti-TNF use seem safe pregnancy human also . Furthermore , anti-TNF therapy use intentionally preconceptionally improve chance pregnancy woman recurrent spontaneous abortion . Since randomize control trial do pregnancy , circumstantial evidence lead decision make daily practice . In case high disease activity use anti-TNF control disease activity outweigh risk potential harm foetus . Most anti-TNF medication monoclonal antibody IgG class . For reason antibody , around week 14 gestation , actively transport across placenta . When used third trimester pregnancy , high level TNF-alpha antibody reach fetal circulation compare maternal circulation , make newborn prone infection . Vaccination newborns live inactivate vaccine therefore contraindicate till anti-TNF alpha antibody level detectable anymore . It often advise stop anti-TNF first trimester pregnancy . The rationale behind approach RA improve pregnancy anyway safe taper medication . In addition think discontinuation anti-TNFearly pregnancy placental transfer anti-TNF antibody take place . However , currently scientific evidence available support assumption . An alternative approach prescribe Certolizumab pregnancy woman pregnancy wish . Certolizumab pegylated antibody TNF-alpha . Since lack Fc-tail transport across placenta trace amount detect newborn . In Erasmus MC protocol recently develop standardize care patient ( already pregnant pregnancy wish ) theory might benefit treatment anti-TNF therapy . This protocol evaluate Pre-CARA study . The Pre-CARA study continuation previous PARA study , focus RA patient high disease activity pregnancy wish . The first objective evaluate treat target treatment strategy woman moderate high disease activity RA pregnancy wish , pre-pregnancy till six month delivery . The treatment strategy base deliberate treatment decision low disease activity , include continuation start biological treatment ( anti-TNF ) , base standard care protocol Erasmus MC . The second objective evaluate safety use anti-TNF woman chronic arthritide require use medication preconceptionally and/or pregnancy .</detailed_description>
