	<detailed_description>Treatment newly diagnose glioblastoma ( GBM ) currently involve surgical resection follow Temozolomide ( TMZ ) chemotherapy concomitant radiotherapy , 6 cycle TMZ adjuvant ( Stupp schedule ) . According many study , patient express enzyme repair MGMT benefit adjunction TMZ . Therefore , many patient receive unnecessary treatment average cost 15,000 euro . The aim project compare different technique analysis MGMT order choose approach best cost/utility ratio , allow selection patient likely respond TMZ chemotherapy first course GBM treatment . Another aspect project evaluate extra cost produce TMZ treatment , therefore expect cost save case use reliable predictive factor . This kind evaluation great importance , MGMT test status begin appear decisional care tree high-grade gliomas The two main technique MGMT analysis currently immunohistochemistry ( IH ) molecular analysis promoter methylation gene . Immunohistochemistry simple quick , consensus label evaluation staining , could lead variability result . Studies promoter methylation currently perform MS-PCR technique , particular article publish N Engl J Med 2005 show patient methylated promoter benefit TMZ adjunction . This technique appear somewhat rudimentary compare technique avoid subjectivity link eye read gel electrophoresis PCR product . In phase one multicenter national study , IH , MS-PCR , MethyLight , pyrosequencing MS-HRM compare retrospective study 100 sample ( frozen molecular analysis paraffin-embedded IH ) , take patient treat accord Stupp protocol follow-up 18 month least . In phase 2 , two technique best cost/efficacy ratio ( base predictive value , analytical quality feasibility test ) implement laboratory accord standard protocol develop referral centre test . The dissemination quality control allow u check result obtain one laboratory another . In phase 3 , sample analyse prospectively different centre medico-economic analysis undertaken integration MGMT analysis standard care GBM patient . Two type analysis perform : ) cost technique , allow u particular estimate possible additional clinical cost generate effect cost hospital stay , order adjust charge system , ii ) alternative care strategies patient , without screening , lead improve target treatment TMZ , aim improve definition `` option recommendation '' ( cost-utility analysis ) .</detailed_description>
