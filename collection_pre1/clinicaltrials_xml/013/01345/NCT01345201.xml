	<brief_summary>This open-label Phase 1 dose escalation study OMP-18R5 subject solid tumor remain standard curative therapy therapy demonstrate survival benefit . Up 44 subject enrol 2 center . Subjects assess safety , immunogenicity , pharmacokinetics , biomarkers , efficacy . No formal interim analysis perform . Prior enrollment , subject undergo screen determine study eligibility . Upon enrollment , subject receive intravenous ( IV ) infusion OMP-18R5 assign dose schedule 56 day . After 56 day , subject assess disease status . If evidence disease progression tumor small , subject may continue receive IV infusion OMP-18R5 every week disease progression . Dose escalation conduct determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . No dose escalation reduction allow within dose cohort . The first 2 subject enrol cohort treat day . The dose may administer time day . Three subject treat dose level dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) observe . If 1 3 subject experience DLT , dose level expand 6 subject . If 2 subject experience DLT , subject dose level 3 additional subject add precede dose cohort unless 6 subject already treat dose level . Subjects assess DLTs time first dose 28 day . Dose escalation newly enrol subject , appropriate , occur subject cohort complete Day 28 DLT assessment . Subjects stable disease response Day 56 allow continue receive weekly dose OMP-18R5 disease progression . An additional 14 subject enrol high dose level result &lt; 2 6 subject experience Grade 3 ( include Grade 3 infusion reaction resolve 24 hour ) 4 adverse event ( DLT ) .</brief_summary>
