	<brief_summary>As critical care practice improve last decade patient recover intensive care therapy . However , muscle atrophy neuromuscular dysfunction commonly observe sequelae critical illness think play important role development intensive care unit acquire weakness ( ICUAW ) . As consequence , entity may contribute impaired physical function prolong convalescence report ICU patient twelve month discharge . Thus , strategy counteract muscle atrophy neuromuscular dysfunction acquire ICU stay may therefore potentially improve physical outcome reduce overall burden critical illness . Limited information available muscle function ICU patient knowledge muscle stimulation method currently available evaluate muscle fatigue large , proximal muscle group , m. quadriceps , non-cooperating ICU patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Positioning subject : A special device , consist rigid pad wooden board rest metal bar , attach metal frame hospital bed , hold knee joint 90-degree angle secure firm support entire thigh ( Fig . 1 ) . The position chosen reduce unnecessary movement minimize risk mechanical ventilate ICU patient . Isometric knee extension force therefore measure subject place supine position hospital bed 30-degree incline head torso . Electrical muscle stimulation : Two carbon electrode pad place distally motor point medial ( vastus medialis ) lateral ( vastus lateralis ) head quadriceps muscle . The motor point define location correspond low possible threshold current motor threshold current defined low train stimulation current result visible muscle contraction . Another pair electrodes ( 5x9 cm ) place 5 cm distal inguinal fold ( 10 ) . To optimize electrical conduction , skin shave rinsed apply electrode . This approach similar previous study ( 11 ) . Initially , two constant current high voltage stimulators deliver ten single stimulus twitch biphasic square pulse widths 300 Î¼s . A train generator switch , trigger delivery 35 Hz current bout 3 second period separate 1-second pause total 40 tetanic contraction . In immediate succession tetanic contraction second series ten single twitch stimulus end protocol . Figure 2 show example actual record force response curve . On first experimental day test current adjusted 75 % motor threshold current . On second test day , train intensity determine stimulation intensity correspond force output level ( mV ) generate first tetanic contraction first test day , maintain ratio medial lateral intensity level . The stimulation parameter two-channel stimulation method choose order increase amount stimulate muscle mass , ensure safe , tetanic contraction non-cooperating subject ; reduce risk excessive muscle damage avoid recruitment sensory fiber thus minimize discomfort . Force measurement : A height adjustable strain gauge , place beneath bed , secure metal frame bed connect horizontally ( 180 degree ) subject non-extensible strap place around angle subject . To minimize leg movement second non-extensible strap attach ankle fix metal bar , pull directly opposite strap hold strain gauge . A bridge circuit use detect change relative resistance strain gauge transform voltage change , proportional torque generate activated muscle , A/D convert , sample 1 kHz subsequently store personal computer offline analysis . Off line data analysis All motor current threshold value average two measurement per side . Tetanic contraction : To ensure attainment plateau level contraction torque value calculate mean last second 3-s contraction . Peak tetanic torque value high obtain value . The tetanic stimulation period subdivide five interval interval 1 corresponds first 60 second ( 1-15 contraction ) , interval 2 61-120 second ( 16-30 contraction ) , interval 3 121-160 second ( 31-40 contraction ) , interval 4 first 120 second ( 1-30 contraction ) interval 5 total period 160 second ( 1-40 contraction ) . For interval resistance muscle fatigue express Fatigue Index ( FI ) calculate ratio sum peak torque value final three contraction relative sum peak torque value first three contraction . Furthermore peak torque value contraction plot slope regression line interval calculate . Twitch contraction : All data 15Hz low pas filter peak torque rise-time calculate tetanic stimulation period . For 10-twitch series peak torque rise-time ( slope 30 % 70 % twitch peak force , Nm/s ) calculate individual twitch . Both peak torque rise-time express average value twitch tetanic contraction . Data integrity : Care take ensure identical study condition uniformity regard time day , location , equipment procedure . Furthermore , test conduct temperature-controlled environment single observer assessment measurement regime maintain throughout study . The investigator ( JBP ) , blind intensity level , determine threshold value MR conduct on-line muscle force measurement . To ensure optimal comparison two experimental secession subject place standardized position secure uniformity posture , joint position orientation thigh . To reduce day-to-day variation electrode placement thigh , mark , along least three permanent landmark , transparent paper , thus serve `` map '' precise identification . On day seven investigator ( JBP ) carefully replace electrode identical day 1 . On test day , gauge calibrate subject receive short standardize low intensity familiarisation session prior test procedure ensure potentiation muscle tissue electrical muscle stimulation present protocol carefully explain . Left/right test order determine randomisation order test maintain second experimental day . Subjects instruct relaxed possible suppress voluntary contraction test . Finally , ensure quality record data , knee extension force immediately display on-line computer screen visual inspection .</detailed_description>
