	<brief_summary>This prospective study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial oral D-methionine ( D-met ) reduce noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL ) tinnitus . The goal study develop safe , oral pharmacological agent augment physical hearing protector noise exposure exceed protective capability ear plug and/or muff . The study population cohort Drill Sergeant ( DS ) instructor trainees 22 day 11 day weapon training . The primary objective study determine efficacy D-met preventing NIHL reduce tinnitus secondary minimum 500 round M-16 weapon train occur 11 day period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Clinical Trial : D-methionine Reduce Noise-Induced Hearing Loss ( NIHL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hearing loss render soldier less able detect identify enemy , less able understand command , particularly background noise typical battlefield , may permanently reduce quality life . In case , hear loss may preclude redeployment result less optimal job assignment . Currently , FDA approve pharmacological prevention exist noise-induced hearing loss ( NIHL ) . We document animal study administration D-methionine ( D-met ) reduce prevent NIHL . We need determine similar efficacy human . Although yet test D-met protection noise-induced tinnitus animal , clinical trial would provide u opportunity also test protection noise induce tinnitus simultaneously . Objective Hypotheses : Primary Hypothesis : Administration oral D-methionine prior , 4 day post-weapons train reduce prevent permanent noise-induced hearing loss . Secondary Hypothesis : Administration oral D-methionine prior , 4 day post-weapons train reduce prevent noise-induced tinnitus . Specific Aims : 1 . To determine whether administer oral D-met prevent permanent NIHL weapon train . This aim address compare result D-met versus placebo administration start 3 day prior , 11 day period weapon training ( Monday-Friday first week , Monday-Thursday second week ) , 4 day total 18 day . Pure tone hearing threshold assess 22 day completion weapon training ( ie ; 18 day last day study drug/placebo administration ) . 2 . To determine whether administer oral D-met prevent tinnitus weapon training . This aim address compare result D-met versus placebo administration start 3 day prior , 11 day period weapon training ( Monday-Friday first week , Monday-Thursday second week ) , 4 day total 18 day . Tinnitus questionnaires assess 22 day completion weapon training ( ie ; 18 day last day study drug/placebo administration ) . 3 . To monitor potential side effect D-met human subject . This aim accomplish subject query day study drug dispense ( twice daily ) final study visit , rout adverse event report study medical personnel , statistician Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</detailed_description>
