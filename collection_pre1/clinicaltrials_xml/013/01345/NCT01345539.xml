	<detailed_description>Patients oligometastatic disease ( defined 5 few site metastatic disease involve 3 few organ system ) potentially curable stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) stereotactic radiotherapy ( SRT ) ( collectively refer stereotactic body radiotherapy SBRT ) metastatic disease sit combination standard curative therapy primary site .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Pathologically ( histologically cytologically ) proven diagnosis solid malignancy within 8 week registration 2 . Eligible disease site include follow Breast Prostate GI ( include colorectal , anal , esophagus , pancreas , gastric exception colon cancer resectable liveronly lesion ) Head neck Skin ( melanoma squamous cell carcinoma ) Lung ( small cell nonsmall cell ) Sarcoma ( soft tissue bone ) Gynecologic ( endometrial , cervical , ovarian , vaginal , vulvar ) 3 . Patients stage IV ( M1 ) combination T N oligometastatic disease define 5 few total sit metastatic disease involve 3 few organ system 1 Examples patient eligible trial T3N2M1 NSCLC 1 CNS metastatic lesion , 2 liver lesion , 1 adrenal lesion . T4N1M1 colorectal cancer 1 liver lesion , 4 bone lesion T3N0M1 gastric cancer 1 supraclavicular lymph node , 2 liver lesion , 2 CNS lesion 4Metastatic disease site must treatable SRS ( discretion treat physician ) . 5Primary disease site must able treated curative intent 6Zubrod Performance Status 01 7Age ≥ 18 8CBC/differential obtain within 4 week prior registration study , adequate bone marrow function define follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,800 cells/mm3 ; Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 ; Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dl acceptable . ) ; 9Women childbearing potential male participant must practice adequate contraception 10Patient must provide study specific informed consent prior study entry . 1 . Ineligible disease site include follow Lymphoma Leukemia Multiple myeloma Primary CNS Peritoneal carcinomatosis Colon cancer resectable liveronly lesion 2 . Examples patient ineligible trial T1N1M1 NSCLC 1 CNS lesion , 1 bone lesion , 1 adrenal lesion cervical lymph node ( 4 site metastatic disease ) T2N1M1 Gastric cancer 6 liver lesion ( 5 site metastatic disease ) 3 . Other Lung cancer pleural effusion ( wet IIIB ) eligible Recurrent cancer eligible Diffuse metastatic spread confine one organ system ineligible ; example include leptomeningeal spread CNS peritoneal carcinomatosis . 4 . Prior systemic chemotherapy study cancer ; note prior chemotherapy different cancer allowable primary cancer diagnose treat within last 3 year cutaneous skin cancer . Patient may previous chemotherapy treatment previous malignancy long chemotherapy complete 3 year ago . 5 . Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field 6 . Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month ; Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month ; Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration ; Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ; note , however , laboratory test liver function coagulation parameter require entry protocol . Immunocompromised patient . 7 . Pregnancy woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception ; exclusion necessary treatment involve study may significantly teratogenic . 8 . Oligometastatic disease site eligible base concern toxicity : trachea involvement ( direct invasion , tumor close abut trachea eligible ) heart ( direct invasion involvement , pericardial lymph node treat ) 9 . Patients unable FDGPET/CT scan , either insurance coverage , patient decision reason eligible study . 10 . Patients unable SRS insurance coverage ability pay SRS</criteria>
