	<brief_title>Intraocular Pressure ( IOP ) Lowering Efficacy Transdermal Brimonidine Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma lead cause irreversible blindness worldwide , primary open-angle glaucoma common form glaucoma . Vision loss cause damage optic nerve . The modern goal glaucoma management avoid glaucomatous damage , nerve damage , preserve visual field total quality life patient minimal side effect . Although intraocular pressure one major risk factor glaucoma , lower via various pharmaceutical and/or surgical technique currently mainstay glaucoma treatment . Intraocular pressure lower medication , usually eye drop . There several different class medication treat glaucoma several different medication class . In order prevent blindness glaucoma , critical patient take glaucoma eye drop accurately faithfully rest life . Poor compliance medication follow-up visit major reason vision loss glaucoma patient . In addition , coordination involve place eye drop eye considerably difficult unpleasant patient many therapy . Thus , localize transdermal eyelid lotion would create leap safety drug delivery time render ocular drug easy non traumatic use .</detailed_description>
