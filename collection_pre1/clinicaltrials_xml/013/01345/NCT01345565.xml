	<brief_title>Hepatocyte Transplantation Acute Decompensated Liver Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Orthotopic liver transplantation become treatment choice patient acute liver failure poor prognostic sign . Survival follow hepatic transplantation improve last decade number reason . These include improvement immunosuppression , improve method preserve transport organ , use donor previously consider unacceptable , use reduced-sized graft , use living-donor hepatic transplantation . Despite encourage survival statistic , continue significant morbidity mortality associate hepatic transplantation . In addition , success hepatic transplantation broaden indication form therapy without concomitant increase number donor available patient . Since development method isolate primary hepatocytes collagenase perfusion , many investigator demonstrate efficacy hepatocyte transplantation treatment liver failure inherit metabolic disorder experimental animal . Treatment liver diseases transplantation isolate hepatocytes rather whole liver several theoretical advantage . Unlike whole liver , isolate hepatocytes could cryopreserved instant availability could modify genetically otherwise enhance specific function , stimulate proliferation abrogate allograft rejection . Hepatocyte transplantation less stressful whole liver transplantation host organ remain intact . Since transplanted cell integrate host liver , could provide restorative potential consequence graft loss would relatively minor . In addition , hepatocyte transplantation would interfere subsequent liver transplantation , become necessary .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects include patient ALF potential conventional liver transplant recipient candidate base PELD criterion well would consider candidate orthotopic liver transplantation ( e.g . patient appear small ill solid organ transplant diagnosis contradiction whole organ transplantation , example , systemic mitochondrial hepatopathy ) . If patient candidate orthotopic liver transplantation ( per standard clinical criterion ) , officially list liver transplantation well hepatocyte transplantation . If subject potential conventional liver transplant recipient candidate donor liver available ; patient receive solid organ transplant . Subjects age 021 year old include study . The patient : 1 . Severe cardiovascular respiratory disease baseline time hepatocyte transplant define 1 . Central venous pressure &gt; 25 mm Hg know , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure &gt; 30 mg Hg 2 . Oxygen saturation &lt; 90 % &gt; 60 % oxygen OR P/F ratio ( Po2/FiO2 ) &lt; 1 . 2 . Hemodynamically significant gastrointestinal bleeding cause systolic blood pressure &lt; 70mmHg time transplantation . 3 . Uncorrectable coagulopathy despite use plasmapheresis would preclude invasive procedure . 4 . Leukopenia time cell transplant , define absolute neutrophil count &lt; 500/ÂµL . 5 . Known allergy immunosuppression medication require post transplant procedure prevention rejection . 6 . Active malignancy except acute liver failure treatment estimate life expectancy &gt; 1 year malignancy control . 7 . Sepsis active infection except without evidence hemodynamically significant uncontrollable systemic sepsis positive blood tissue culture . 8 . Intrauterine pregnancy . All female childbearing potential receive pregnancy test prior enrollment .</criteria>
