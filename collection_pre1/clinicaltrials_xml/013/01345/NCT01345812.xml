	<detailed_description>So far assessment development potential single embryo limited vulnerability embryo expose fluctuation temperature CO2 level . Thus embryo allow leave incubator limited time period . However , development time-lapse system clinical use possible make continuous time-lapse recording embryos safe incubator environment . The embryo compromise , entire embryonic development still see , subsequently provide new essential information competence single embryo . Based expected probability select viable competent embryo increase , , turn , increase success rate couple seek infertility treatment .</detailed_description>
