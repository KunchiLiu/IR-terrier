	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) considerably harmful effect morbidity mortality cancer patient . Several guideline recommendation make use anticoagulation prevention treatment VTE Western patient cancer . In Western VTE guideline , solid cancer patient receive abdominal major surgery strongly recommend receive pharmacologic prophylactic anticoagulation low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) perioperative period . These guideline recommendation base high incidence postoperative VTE development Western cancer patient . However , many cumulative data effect different ethnicity VTE development investigator clinicians admit Asian ethnicity lower incidence VTE Western ethnicity . Therefore , may advisable apply Western guideline clinical situation Asian cancer patient . Although gastric cancer common cancer Asia , prospective data incidence VTE development postoperative period gastric cancer surgery . In word , Asian doctor include Korean clinician n't know exact incidence surgery-related VTE . From clinical experience , Korean surgeon think incidence postoperative VTE development rare . They also much concern complication bleed might cause routine use pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis perioperative period . Therefore , clinical situation , Korean surgeon perform perioperative pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis use LMHW . Considering clinical situation Korea , uncritical acceptance Western guideline inappropriate . The necessity pharmacologic thrombo-prophylaxis answered result prospective study incidence postoperative VTE development gastric cancer surgery . Moreover , current surgical trend cancer patient minimally invasive approach laparoscopic surgery . However , necessity pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis patient receive laparoscopic cancer surgery evaluate even Western country . Western guideline also exactly answer whether pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis really necessary cancer patient receive laparoscopic cancer surgery . On background , study design .</brief_summary>
