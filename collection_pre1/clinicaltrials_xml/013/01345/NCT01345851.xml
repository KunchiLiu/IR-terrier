	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study image-guided hypofractionated radiation therapy ( RT ) give together hypofractionated RT boost combination chemotherapy treat patient stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) remove surgery . RT use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Hypofractionated RT may able send x-ray directly tumor cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving RT together combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell allow doctor save part body cancer start</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Image-Guided Hypofractionated Radiation Therapy With Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Boost Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Stage II-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) use hypofractionated RT patient stage II-III NSCLC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine dose-limiting toxicity , MTD reach . II . To determine tumor local control ( LC ) . III . To determine lung cancer disease specific survival ( DSS ) . IV . To determine overall survival ( OS ) . V. To assess transform growth factor-beta ( TGF-B ) , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 level predictive biomarkers treatment induce tissue injury . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study image-guided hypofractionated RT . Patients undergo image-guided hypofractionated RT 35 minute 5 day week 2 week follow 5 fraction hypofractionated RT boost . Patients also receive standard carboplatin paclitaxel 3 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4-6 week , every 3 month first 2 year , periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
