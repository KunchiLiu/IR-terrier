	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study robotic-assisted surgery treat patient spine tumor . Robotic-assisted surgery less invasive type surgery spine tumor may fewer side effect improve recovery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Robotic-Assisted Surgery Treating Patients With Spine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform small pilot study demonstrate feasibility neurosurgical spinal procedure use da Vinci surgical robot . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare complication rate , operative time estimate blood loss historical control . II . To observe wound healing , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) leak , neurological injury hardware failure . II . Routine image spinal segment . OUTLINE : Patients undergo robotic-assisted surgery use da Vinci robot . After completion study treatment , patient follow 100 day .</detailed_description>
