	<brief_summary>Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma commonest type aggressive non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , type cancer cell call lymphocyte make part immune system . Although patient cured chemotherapy use initial treatment , 20-30 % patient still experience relapse . Curing relapsed disease much less successful , even use high dos chemotherapy stem cell transplant . There urgent need effective , new agent treat patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma relapse developed resistance form chemotherapy . This trial use drug call AZD1152 interfere ability cancer cell divide grow . It use patient types cancer , never lymphoma patient . Responses cancer see , particularly leukaemia disease relate lymphoma . The investigator plan use agent 15 patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma potentially curative treatment fail . The main aim see whether drug show activity type lymphoma . This mainly assessed use CT PET scan . The investigator also investigate well blood test predict response drug toxicity drug - call biomarker study form part clinical trial . The main aim study assess toxicity treatment . Previous study human suggest drug reasonably well tolerate , although side effect stomatitis ( soreness mouth ) suppression bone marrow ( lead risk infection bleed ) see .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male Female , age ≥ 18 yr . ECOG performance score 0 , 1 2 . Life expectancy least 12 week . Haematological biochemical index within range show Lab Test Value require Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 9g/dL White Blood Count ( WBC ) ≥ 2x109/L Platelet count ≥ 100x109/L Absolute Neutrophil count ≥ 1.0x109/L ; Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ( SGOT ) ALT ≤ 1.5 x ULN Creatinine clearance ( CockcroftGault ) &gt; 50 ml/min Relapsed refractory DLBCL participant must receive least one potentially curative establish immunochemotherapy lymphoma regimen contain rituximab ( e.g . RCHOP , RPMitCEBO , RGCVP , RCNOP ) . Participants must also fail ineligible salvage/high dose therapy . Relapsed refractory DLBCL proven biopsy ( within 6 month enrolment trial ) ; either de novo DLBCL transform follicular lymphoma . At least 1 lesion ( &gt; 1.5cm ) , previously irradiate , accurately measure CT FDG avid CTPET scanning , define Cheson criterion . Able give inform consent capable cooperate protocol . Any anticancer therapy ( include radiotherapy participation clinical trial ) within 28 day prior Day 1 . Patients may however receive corticosteroid antilymphoma treatment 50mg daily prednisolone equivalent screening . At screen ( ) must taper low dose ( 10mg daily less ) time AZD1152 commences . This may continue indication lymphoma treatment throughout study . Any unresolved toxicity prior anticancer therapy great CTCAE grade I ( except alopecia ) . Previous treatment aurora kinase inhibitor . Clinical evidence central nervous system involvement . Another active malignancy within past five year , except adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma cervix situ . Clinically significant uncontrolled major medical condition ( ) include limited : active infection , bleed diathesis , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cardiac arrhythmia psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance protocol requirement . Major surgery within 4 week prior entry study ( exclude placement vascular access biopsy ) involve general anaesthesia respiratory assistance . Mean QTc interval &gt; 470 m calculate 3 ECGs use Fridericia 's Bazett 's correction 12lead ECG machine . Serologically positive HIV , hepatitis B C assess within 28 day initiation study treatment use ELISA method perform HPA accredit laboratory . Participants reproductive potential willing use adequate contraceptive measure duration study ( male female participant ) . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Female participant must negative urinary serum pregnancy test do evidence postmenopausal status ( Defined absence menstruation great 12 month , bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy ) . Participants live attenuate yellow fever vaccine within 6 month trial begin . Participants willing able comply protocol duration study , schedule followup visit examination .</criteria>
