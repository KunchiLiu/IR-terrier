	<brief_summary>The purpose research study examine effect overfeed exercise blood level hormone associate regulate appetite , also think feeling hunger satiety ( fullness ) . Previous study show non-obese people different amount hormone blood compare obese people . The investigator hypothesize exercise promote improve insulin sensitivity correspond beneficial change obese individual . The investigator predict exercise induce change 24-hour plasma hormone level associate improved appetite overfeed obese individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In randomized cross-over design , participant complete two separate six-day &amp; seven night inpatient stay ( separate least 4 week ) University Wisconsin Hospital 's Clinical Translational Research Core ( CTRC ) . During six-day &amp; seven night visit , participant feed energy balance diet ( energy intake = energy expenditure ) first three day follow three day overfeed ( 130 % energy balance diet ) . During one inpatient period , participant exercise twice daily ( morning , even ) total approximately 120 minute per day indoor exercise bicycle ~50 % maximal aerobic fitness . During inpatient visit , participant exercise inactive . The investigator examine effect short-term positive energy balance exercise 24-hour plasma level hormone relate hunger satiety . These hormone include leptin , ghrelin , insulin , peptide YY sedentary lean obese men woman . Our primary hypothesis obese person exercise , average 24-hour plasma leptin level increase obese individual overfeed compare energy balance feeding , fail sedentary condition . In contrast , investigator predict lean individual appropriate increase average 24-hour leptin level response overfeed regardless exercise treatment . Thus , investigator suggest failure average 24-hour leptin response overfeed set obese person continue slow weight gain , leptin hunger signal fails detect short-term overfeed produce response . The investigator hypothesize exercise promote improve insulin sensitivity increase leptin obese . The investigator predict change average 24-hour plasma leptin level correlate self-selected energy intake lean individual , overfeed plus exercise obese individual . In addition , hunger satiety response human complex , study characterize average 24-hour plasma level ghrelin , stimulate hunger , peptide YY , stimulate satiety fullness , lean obese individual determine plasma level alter obesity response short-term positive energy balance . Lastly , study involve bank blood tissue specimens future research . If decided analysis scientific value , genetic analysis conduct alteration gene involve synthesis , receptor , hunger satiety hormone investigate study design .</detailed_description>
