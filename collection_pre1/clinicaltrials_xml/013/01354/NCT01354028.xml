	<brief_summary>Premature infant sometimes require sedation ensure minimal movement diagnostic procedure MRIs . However , sedative may produce adverse effect . The purpose two-day study determine whether massage therapy promote sleep preterm infant also help stay asleep , provide safe way sedate infant procedure . A small instrument call sleep watch actigraph place around infant 's ankle measure muscle activity provide indication sleep . Infants receive 10- minute massage one morning study massage alternate morning . Recordings actigraph show whether difference sleep pattern without massage .

The primary outcome measure use document response massage measure Motionlogger® Micro Sleep Watch® Actigraph ( Actigraph ) . The actigraph place infant 's ankle approximately follow 9 feed record low extremity activity approximately 12 pm feed . Massages occur minimum 30 minute follow morning feed infant quiet alert state approximately 10 minute length . Baby lotion use standard care NICU use facilitate ease massage . Primary outcome measure include data record actigraph : ( ) sleep onset follow massage intervention , ( b ) sleep end time , ( c ) number awakening duration awakening study interval , ( ) duration long sustained sleep period , ( e ) sleep efficiency . Secondary outcome include oxygen saturation heart rate massage 30 minute massage .</detailed_description>
