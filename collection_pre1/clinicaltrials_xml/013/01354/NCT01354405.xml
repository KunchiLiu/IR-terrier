	<brief_title>Somatostatin Analogues Volume Reducing Treatment Polycystic Livers ( RESOLVE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim single center observational study assess effect lanreotide polycystic liver kidney . This achieve assess total liver kidney volume , several urinary marker could predict kidney damage kidney dysfunction , GFR , blood pressure , urinary tubular damage marker serum biomarker FGF23 . The investigator aim include 43 patient affected polycystic liver due ADPKD . The duration trial 28 week . The treatment 24 week first screen visit take place four week start treatment . Eligible patient invited participate .</detailed_description>
