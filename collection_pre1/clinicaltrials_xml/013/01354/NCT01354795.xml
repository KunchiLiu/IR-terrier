	<brief_summary>EUS-guided FNA prove safe useful method tissue sample gastrointestinal track lesion organ lesion include mediastinal intra-abdominal lymph node , pancreas hepatobiliary tree . The usefulness EUS-FNA depend several factor . For example , experience endosonographers , adequate sampling , sample preparing , accurate interpretation cytopathologist on-site cytopathology interpretation . However , many hospital , cytopathologist present EUS-FNA . Therefore , determine appropriate method obtain prepare EUS-guided FNA important make correct diagnosis without on-site cytopathologist . Suction self-retracting 10-mL syringe likely bring cellularity also blood . Some endosonographers use suction , others use constant suction . Usually specimen expel needle push stylet needle . But use stylet EUS-FNA difficult time consume process . Injecting air recommend , spray uncontrollably , increase risk air artifact specimen clot . However , study one appropriate , suction suction push stylet inject air . The hypothesis aim prospective randomize controlled trial follow : First hypothesis : There difference adequacy , cellularity , bloodiness , contamination , air artifact specimen obtain method , suction suction push stylet inject air . Aim # 1 : To compare adequacy , cellularity , bloodiness , contamination , air artifact specimen obtain method , suction suction push stylet inject air . Second hypothesis : There difference sensitivity , specificity , diagnostic accuracy , positive predictive value , negative predictive value statistical agreement specimen obtain method , suction suction push stylet inject air . Aim # 2 : To compare sensitivity , specificity , diagnostic accuracy , positive predictive value , negative predictive value statistical agreement specimen obtain method , suction suction push stylet inject air .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>On-site cytopathology interpretation EUS-FNA significant clinical impact increase diagnostic yield FNA . However , many hospital provision on- site diagnosis EUS FNA specimen . Therefore , optimal specimen obtainment preparation EUS FNA important accurate diagnosis . EUS FNA perform without self-retracting 10-mL syringe accord endosonographer 's preference . In general , little cellularity immediate cytologic evaluation , use suction , , conversely , sample bloody , use less suction . However , hard determine quality specimen without on-site cytopathology interpretation . The actual way material express needle may influence yield . Injecting air express material problematic , material may spray uncontrollably , risk air artifact specimen clot may increase . A controlled method push stylet slowly advance needle tip . But use stylet EUS-FNA difficult time consume process also increase risk accidental needle stick injury . However , firm evidence one appropriate , suction suction push stylet inject air . If significant difference method , appropriate method obtain prepare aspirate undergo EUS-FNA suction inject air EUS FNA may perform easy shorter . In prospective randomize controlled trial , patient peripancreatic mass EUS-FNA include . One patient underwent least four puncture EUS-FNA . The sequence EUS-FNA first four method select use randomization scheme obtain seal envelope : ( 1 ) negative pressure suction 10 mL syringe push stylet ; ( 2 ) negative pressure suction 10 mL syringe inject air ; ( 3 ) without negative pressure suction push stylet ; ( 4 ) without negative pressure suction inject air . EUS FNA perform two experienced endosonographers . All specimens read experienced pathologist blind method . The investigator compare four group term adequacy , cellularity , bloodiness , contamination , air artifact . The sensitivity , specificity , diagnostic accuracy , positive predictive value , negative predictive value statistical agreement different method calculate .</detailed_description>
