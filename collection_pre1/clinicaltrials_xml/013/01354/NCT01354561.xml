	<brief_summary>The present study investigate influence respiratory affection heart rate variability ( HRV ) paediatric patient . We hypothesise respiratory physiotherapy would promote beneficial effect cardiac autonomic modulation . Twenty-four child , divide respiratory disease group ( RG ) control ( CG ) group , study . Analysis HRV perform RG dorsal decubitus position four different moment : basal record ( 30 minute ) ; 5 minute respiratory physiotherapy mean airway clearance technique ( 10-minute record ) ; 5 minute nasotracheal suction ( 10-minute record ) ; 40 minute nasotracheal suction ( 30-minute record ) . CG group submit protocol , except nasotracheal suction , perform due ethical reason .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study heart rate variability ( HRV ) method allow non-invasive selective evaluation change cardiac autonomic modulation . Its use several clinical situation provide important information , serve evaluation instrument well understanding involvement autonomic nervous system various physiopathological situation . With regard applicability HRV analysis paediatric population , know maturity progression sympathetic vagal division accompany grow increase autonomic modulation pre- post-natal period . In turn , study address association pathological paediatric condition change cardiac autonomic modulation , consequently , HRV . Among pathology , respiratory affection main factor morbidity mortality child , since newborn peculiar aspect involve respiratory system easily lead lung failure . Within context , one note importance respiratory physiotherapy intervention use specific procedure case order decrease airway resistance improve ventilation/perfusion ratio , thus improve respiratory function minimise clinical severity . Consequently , patient suffer obstructive pathology neuromuscular dysfunction , make cough inefficient mechanism , physiotherapy help recover condition . Therefore , respiratory physiotherapy influence several hospitalisation phase , contribute make hospital stay short less difficult paediatric inpatient promote humanise efficient environment base patient 's need . In sense , possible paediatric inpatient present important alteration cardiovascular autonomic control , since constant oscillation cardiac hemodynamic parameter observe . However , study correlate HRV respiratory pathological condition paediatric inpatient rare , either respiratory physiotherapy procedure , application airway clearance technique .</detailed_description>
