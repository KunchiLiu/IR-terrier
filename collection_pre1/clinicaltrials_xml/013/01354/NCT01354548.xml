	<brief_summary>Trismus ( limited jaw mobility ) , occur patient undergo radiotherapy specific area head neck . Trismus lead difficulty eating , swallow , speech general mouth hygiene , negative effect quality life . Research area trismus limit ; know exactly trismus develops , one study suggest patient experience diminished opening low dose 15 Gy . Literature suggest benefit train programme , lack evidence support use training programme radiotherapy . The purpose study investigate effectiveness training programme radiotherapy , report incidence trismus patient receive radiotherapy jaw muscle . The study also investigate quality life radiotherapy one year complete treatment . Patients meet criterion give consensus study divide two group : Group 1 : Training TheraBite Jaw Motion Rehabilitation System , portable system utilize repetitive passive motion stretch restore mobility flexibility jaw musculature . Individuals train five time day . Group 2 : Conventional treatment ( jaw measurement week ) . If individual jaw mobility decrease 15 % original start measurement , patient automatically offer training program ( group 1 ) . During radiation therapy hospital specialist dentist measure jaw mobility week , thereafter 3,6,12 month complete Radiation Therapy . On 5 different occasion patient request complete Quality life questionnaire . Patient 's record training frequency log book .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Trismus During Radiotherapy Quality Life Head Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Summary study programme Background During Radiation therapy mouth , throat trachea fibrosis often occur chew muscle round jaw cause development trismus ( limited jaw mobility ) . Trismus cause pain , difficulty eating , swallow , speech difficulty general mouth hygiene . Despite fact condition document old literature , limited research incidence trismus . There need randomised study investigate prevention trismus Radiation Therapy . Aims The specific aim study investigate effectiveness Prophylactic training muscle warm-up programme mechanical device ( TheraBite ) prevent trismus Radiation Therapy one year complete therapy . The study also aim investigate incidence radiotherapy-induced trismus patient receive radiotherapy masseter , temporalis , pterygoid muscle . Finally study investigates whether trismus affect quality life . Methods Patients Sixty consecutive patient , two different radiation clinic Sweden , randomise two different group use computer programme . Treatment procedures 1 . Intervention group : Daily train programme TheraBite train passive movement , precede warm-up programme . Mouth open measurement make week treatment end radiotherapy , three , six 12 month treatment . 2 . Control group : Receiving traditional radiation therapy nursing care , measure patient mouth open week treatment , end radiation therapy , three , six , 12 month treatment . The training programme group one offer group soon evidence trismus develops . This training record patient log book . Weight , height , Mucositis analysis quality life make commencement radiation therapy , end radiation therapy , three , six , 12 month treatment . The patient 's weight measure every week . Results The result study give new vital information give basis develop clinical method identify treat cancer patient suffer trismus . Thus give new knowledge use formulate clinical practice .</detailed_description>
