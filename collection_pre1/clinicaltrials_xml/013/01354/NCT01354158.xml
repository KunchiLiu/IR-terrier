	<brief_title>A Dose Titration Droxidopa Patients With Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Persons spinal cord injury ( SCI ) , due partial complete interruption sympathetic pathway brainstem cardiovascular system prone blood pressure dysregulation include hypotension worsen orthostasis . It well establish orthostatic hypotension ( OH ) hinders rehabilitation process acute phase SCI also may hamper resumption independence activity person chronic SCI . Surprisingly , report exist use efficacy alpha receptor agonist ( midodrine hydrochloride ) restore blood pressure normal level person tetraplegia . Our group recently report normalization supine blood pressure relatively low dose nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ( NOSi ) , nitro-L-arginine methyl ester ( L-NAME ) . In addition alpha agonist NOSi , use norepinephrine ( NE ) precursor , droxidopa , may safe efficacious treatment orthostatic hypotension human model SCI . It demonstrate blood pressure-raising effect 3,4-threo-dihydroxyphenylserine ( droxidopa ) occur independently central nervous system human model neurologic OH conversion norepinephrine ( NE ) neuronal non-neuronal tissue . Oral droxidopa take peripheral sympathetic neuron , convert NE , store release appropriately postural stress . Droxidopa use effective treatment OH several human model neurologically cause autonomic disorder , familial amyloid polyneuropathy , autoimmune autonomic neuropathy , pure autonomic failure , multiple system atrophy . The effectiveness droxidopa improve orthostatic blood pressure person SCI study . To date , single case use drug person SCI report use droxidopa case successful . The purpose proposal determine dose effectiveness , duration action adverse event follow droxidopa administration hypotensive individual SCI . To determine efficacy , duration action safety escalate dose droxidopa systemic blood pressure , cerebral blood flow vasoactive hormone catecholamine upright seat posture . Primary Question : 1 . What low dose droxidopa increase seat SBP 115±5 mmHg men 105±5 mmHg woman ? - When defined increase SBP occur oral ingestion droxidopa ? - How long dose droxidopa sustain SBP level ? - What vital sign subjective symptomology follow droxidopa administration ? Secondary Question : 1 . What MFV response droxidopa administration hypotensive individual SCI ? - Does increase SBP correspond increase MCA MFV ? Tertiary Question : 1 . What vasoactive hormone catecholamine response droxidopa administration hypotensive individual SCI ? - Does droxidopa administration result change APR , Aldo NE hypotensive individual SCI ?</detailed_description>
