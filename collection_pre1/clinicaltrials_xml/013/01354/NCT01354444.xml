	<brief_summary>This 6-month pilot randomize double-blind placebo-controlled trial carvedilol , primary objective determine whether carvedilol treatment associate improvement Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) compare placebo treatment . Secondary objective monitor change cerebrospinal fluid amyloid level whether dose safe well-tolerated AD patient . Clinical assessment perform baseline , 3 month , 6 month , cerebrospinal fluid blood sample obtain baseline 6 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study measure decline episodic memory participant early AD take carvedilol compare placebo treatment evidence Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ( HVLT ) . cerebrospinal fluid level AÎ² oligomers early AD , measure participant receive carvedilol treatment compare placebo treatment . Adverse effect monitor participant receive carvedilol compare placebo . To assess adverse event , routine chemistry hematology study , vital sign , electrocardiographic parameter 6 month randomize placebo-controlled double-blind treatment carvedilol target dose 25 mg daily , compare 25 early AD participant take carvedilol vs. 25 early AD participant take placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis AD National Institute Neurological Communicative Disorders Stroke Alzheimer 's Disease Related Disorders Association ( NINCDS/ADRDA ) criteria MiniMental State Exam ( MMSE ) 1626 . This range correspond roughly `` mild '' AD rat CDR , provide rapid test efficient screen potential participant . Clinical Dementia Rating ( CDR ) &lt; 1 ( mild dementia ) . This correspond `` early '' AD . Participants eligible AD diagnosis CDR 0.5 1.0 . The category CDR 0.5 AD particularly important include participant early stage diagnose dementia ( opposed mild cognitive impairment ) thus `` early '' clinical stage AD . Patients allow remain current FDAapproved Alzheimer 's treatment include cholinesterase inhibitor memantine , long dose stable &gt; = 3 month . These medication lack notable effect amyloid synthesis metabolism thus reason exclude . The rationale behind require stable dose change trial attribute study intervention rather recent change medication affect cognition . Patients allow remain antidepressant antipsychotic medication long dose stable &gt; = 3 month . The rationale . Knowledgeable informant available study visit . This standard practice AD research many standard instrument questionnaires trial require knowledgeable informant . Exclusion criterion Evidence nonAD dementias include Huntington 's disease , Parkinson 's disease , frontotemporal dementia . 2.Current Diagnostic Statistical Manual Diploma Social Medicine ( DSM ) IV Axis I diagnose dementia , include major depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , anxiety disorder , alcohol abuse , substance abuse . These diagnosis would merit treatment plan change condition could significantly affect cognitive functional outcome , confound effort study efficacy study intervention . Any clinically significant medical condition could interfere subject 's ability safely participate study follow . Current use Betablocking agent . Contraindications use Betablocking agent , determine consultation patient 's primary care physician ( appropriate ) cardiologist . Clinically significant hepatic renal insufficiency .</criteria>
