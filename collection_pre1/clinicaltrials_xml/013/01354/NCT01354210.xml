	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study test SMS ( short message service ) text message technology improve medication adherence among youth live HIV ( YLH ) . The propose study randomize control trial effect text message reminder ART ( anti-retroviral therapy ) adherence among non-adherent YLH . Daily text message reminder send patient randomize intervention group accord medication schedule , 6 month . The investigator enroll non-adherent YLH , age 16-29 . Half sample , randomize intervention , receive daily SMS text message medication reminder half randomize control condition receive standard care ( SOC ) . For controlled trial , adherence level viral load collect baseline , 3-month 6-month follow-up . In addition , end initial 6-month enrollment period , participant control condition cross-over SMS intervention participant intervention condition cease receive SMS intervention . Adherence viral load data collect group 9- 12-month follow-up point . The investigator hypothesize youth intervention condition demonstrate clinically meaningful increase adherence 3 6 month post-baseline , approximately 70 % 90 % adherence ART .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose propose study test intervention use SMS text message technology improve medication adherence among YLH . The propose study randomize control trial effect text message reminder ART adherence rate among non-adherent YLH . Daily text message reminder send patient randomize intervention group accord medication schedule , six month . Participants option choose tailor personalized message may change request throughout study period . The investigator enroll YLH , age 16-29 ( i.e. , perinatally , transfusion , behaviorally acquire -- consistent feasibility study distribution infection mode primary clinic site ) demonstrate poor adherence ART . Half sample , randomize intervention , receive daily short message service ( SMS ; aka `` text message '' ) medication reminder half randomize control condition receive standard care ( SOC ) . For controlled trial , adherence level viral load collect baseline , 3-month 6-month follow-up . In addition , end initial 6-month enrollment period , participant control condition cross-over SMS intervention 6 month participant intervention condition cease receive SMS intervention . Adherence viral load data collect group 9-month 12-month follow-up point . The advantage additional feature allow investigator offer intervention participant , evaluate intervention effect control group ( confirm intervention effect ) ass sustain intervention effect intervention group ( post-intervention ) . Specific Aims : 1 . To determine efficacy SMS text message intervention primary outcome : adherence ART among poorly adherent YLH , age 16-29 ( group show high risk substance use ) 6-month intervention period , effect assess 3 6-months post-baseline . 2 . To explore efficacy SMS text message intervention secondary , exploratory outcome : viral load cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4 ) count , 6-month intervention period , effect assess 3 6-months post-baseline . 3 . To assess feasibility , acceptability , satisfaction intervention clinical trial approach objective ( e.g. , automated message delivery response count ) subjective measure ( e.g. , report satisfaction , acceptability ) . Primary Hypotheses : 1 . Youth randomize SMS text message intervention show great improvement level adherence ART secondary outcome intervention period 3 6 month post-baseline , comparison receive standard care . The investigator hypothesize least 10-point difference adherence level group 3 6 month intervention clinically meaningful . 2 . Youth randomize SMS text message intervention maintain improvement adherence ( i.e. , &gt; 90 % adherence ) 9-month 12-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Diagnosed HIV infection ( perinatally , transfusion , behaviorally acquire ; document medical record review verification refer professional ) Have cell phone access Report regular use text message technology 16 29 year old Englishspeaking On ART regimen least one month time enrollment ( i.e. , new ART ) poor adherence antiretroviral regimen . For purpose study , poor adherence define screen one following : ) per AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( ACTG ) screen questionnaire , participant report miss least one dose last week b ) report miss 3 medication dos last month . Do report regular followup physician ( least every 3 month ) Pregnant ART due pregnancy ( i.e. , long prescribed ART delivery ) Unable provide assent consent .</criteria>
