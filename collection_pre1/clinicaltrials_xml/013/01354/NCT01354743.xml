	<criteria>Outpatient , male female subject race , 4075 year age . Mild Moderate temoral atrophy ( 1 2 Four Point Temporal Atrophy Scale ) One following : Periocular rhytids characterize measurement 3 maximum attempted muscle contraction ( maximum smiling ) upon evaluation use RaoGoldman 5 point Facial Wrinkle Scale . Mild moderate glabella rhytiuds measurment 3 upon evaluation use RaoGoldman 5point Facial Wrinkle Scale . Subjects enrol previous history facial cold sore , medicate avoid recurrence . able understand requirement study sign Institutional Review Board Informed Consent/HIPPA Authorization form receive copy . Subjects childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test result baseline practice reliable method contraception throughout study : A female consider childbearing potential unless post menopausal &gt; 12 month prior study drug administration . without uterus and/or ovary ; surgically sterile ( e.g. , tubal ligation ) &gt; 6 month prior study drug administration . The following method contraception , properly use , generally consider reliable female childbearing potential may participate study : hormonal contraceptives† ( oral , patch , injection , implant ) ; male condom intravaginal spermicide diaphragm cervical cap spermicide ; vaginal contraceptive ring ; intrauterine device ; surgical sterilization ( bilateral tubal ligation ) ; partner vasectomized†† ; total sexual abstinence* . Hormonal contraceptive must start least 90 day prior study drug administration , intrauterine contraceptive device must place least 30 day prior study drug administration . Vasectomized &gt; 3 month 0 sperm count ; * Female subject childbearing potential sexually active require practice reliable method contraception . They may enrol Investigator 's discretion provide counseled remain sexually inactive duration study understand possible risk involve get pregnant study . Previous injection botulinum toxin serotype within 6 month , Previous injection semipermanent filler upper face ( i.e . glabella , periorbital , temporal area ) within last 12 month . Previous injection permanent filler upper face ( i.e . glabella , periorbital , temporal area ) exclude . Subjects pregnant ( positive urine pregnancy test ) , breastfeed , childbearing potential practicing reliable method birth control . Subjects plan facial cosmetic procedure study period prior cosmetic procedure ( i.e. , surgery ) visible scar may affect evaluation response . Facial asymmetry , ptosis , excessive dermatochalasis , deep dermal scarring , thick sebaceous skin , inability substantially lessen upper facial rhytids even physically spread apart . Previous cosmetic surgery upper face ( e.g. , periorbital surgery , brow lift , eyelid eyebrow surgery , etc. ) . Laser resurfacing , soft tissue augmentation periocular area 12 month precede Visit 1 . Medical condition may increase risk exposure botulinum toxin include diagnose Myasthenia Gravis , EatonLambert Syndrome , Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis , disease might interfere neuromuscular function . Current use aminoglycoside antibiotic , curarelike agent , agent might interfere neuromuscular ( skeletal ) function . Profound atrophy/excessive weakness muscle target area injection . History facial nerve palsy . Any patient know autoimmune disease compromise immune system ie HIV , AIDS current chemotherapy . Infection injection site systemic infection ( case , postpone study entry one week follow recovery ) . Allergy sensitivity component Dysport™ and/or PerlaneL® . Evidence recent alcohol drug abuse . Medical and/or psychiatric problem severe enough interfere study result ( Investigator opinion ) . History poor cooperation , noncompliance medical treatment , unreliability . Exposure investigational drug study within 30 day Baseline Visit .</criteria>
