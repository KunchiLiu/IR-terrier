	<brief_summary>The chronic airflow limitation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) patient result increased dyspnea physical activity restrict many COPD patient ability perform exercise general whole-body exercise particular . Single limb training perform one-legged cycling show effective patient COPD . This exercise regime result less stress ventilatory system training execute use simultaneously small muscle mass . However , positive physiological effect exercise train occur involve muscle ( ) . To benefit patient daily life , relevant muscle include exercise training . The aim current randomize control multicenter trial ( RCT ) determine effect high-repetitive single limb exercise ( HRSLE ) combination COPD specific patient education , compare COPD specific patient education alone patient moderate severe ( stage II-IV ) COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Limb Resistance Training Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) major cause chronic morbidity mortality world . It one common chronic diseases 700.000 people estimate suffer COPD Sweden . Exercise intolerance key disable factor COPD , decrease exercise capacity , leg fatigue dyspnea among frequently report symptom . Different training modality evaluate uncover effective way training patient COPD . Traditionally research use whole-body , major muscle mass training regime investigate effect endurance resistance COPD patient . However recent research demonstrate positive effect use train regime involve simultaneous small muscle mass compare traditional exercise . The concept use regime put less stress ventilator system exercise minimize effect chronic airflow limitation enhance ability able exercise group patient compare traditional training use major muscle mass exercise regime . Although recent research show positive effect single limb train use one-legged cycling , one major limitation small amount important muscle COPD patient incorporate . Therefore , aim study : ( ) examine effect single limb exercise regime local muscle endurance , maximal strength , quality life , dyspnea , walk capacity , self-efficacy , anxiety depression , ( ii ) examine physiological effect differ man woman ( iii ) investigate exercise regime feasible safe use patient COPD . Patients diagnose moderate severe COPD accord GOLD criterion randomly assign constitute either exercise control group The exercise group participate high-repetitive single limb exercise regime , consist upper low limb exercise elastic resistance , compromise three session per week period 8 week . The exercise regime perform group Ume√• University Hospital Northern Sweden , Huddinge University Hospital , Sweden supervise experienced physiotherapist . Both exercise control group receive four session standardize patient education 8 week intervention period . After completion study , patient control group offer participation single limb exercise regime . The important upper low extremity muscle COPD patient identified exercise design specific . The exercise regime consist 8 exercise , 4 upper extremity 4 low extremity exercise . Starting position performance exercise standardize resistance individually adjust progressed accord rat dyspnea muscle fatigue . Before 8 week intervention period follow information collect . Effects maximal strength , muscular endurance , dyspnea , self-efficacy , anxiety depression . The relationship change health related variable change exercise capacity , sex related difference train effect , feasibility program , strategy determine adequate start resistance provide accurate resistance involve movement relationship muscle fatigue dyspnea different exercise test also analyze .</detailed_description>
