	<brief_summary>Nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM ) ubiquitous organisms environment increasingly recognize significant cause chronic pulmonary infection immunocompetent individual ( 1 ) . The frequently encounter NTM lung disease worldwide cause Mycobacterium avium-intracellular complex ( MAC ) ( 2-4 ) . In several study chest compute tomography ( CT ) , researcher demonstrate presence bilateral multifocal bronchiolitis ( well-defined small nodule branch centrilobular nodule , tree-in-bud pattern ) bronchiectasis distribute mainly right middle lobe lingular segment indicative NTM pulmonary infection ( 7-11 ) . Accordingly , believe radiologic finding bilateral bronchiolitis bronchiectasis chest CT scan specifically suggest NTM pulmonary infection ( 1 ) . These CT finding , however , may specific NTM pulmonary infection . CT pattern bronchiectasis bronchiolitis pulmonary infection cause various NTM organism report , organism include Mycobacterium kansasii , Mycobacterium xenopi , rapidly grow mycobacteria Mycobacterium abscessus , Mycobacterium fortuitum , Mycobacterium chelonae ( 12-14 ) . In addition , patient bronchiectasis bronchiolitis NTM pulmonary infection . Two recent study show 50 % patient CT feature MAC pulmonary infection ( 9,15 ) . To best knowledge , however , report incidence NTM patient bronchiectasis bronchiolitis country low incidence TB . Thus , purpose study determine frequency NTM pulmonary infection patient bilateral bronchiectasis bronchiolitis chest CT investigate whether CT finding specifically indicative MAC infection specific pathogen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Incidence Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Pulmonary Infection Bilateral Bronchiectasis Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Population During study period helical thin-section thoracic CT scan obtain patient diagnosis bronchiectasis know suspected bronchiectasis basis clinical symptom sign chronic cough sputum production . One chest radiologist review consecutive patient bilateral multifocal bronchiectasis bronchiolitis ( well-defined small nodule branch centrilobular nodule ) , regardless presence cavitary lesion , suspect NTM pulmonary infection basis chest CT finding . Those patient unilateral bronchiectasis , although bronchiectasis combine bronchiolitis , exclude study . Those isolated finding bilateral bronchiectasis bilateral bronchiolitis also also exclude . The patient undergo diagnostic work-up NTM pulmonary infection . For diagnosis NTM infection , sputum AFB ( Ziehl-Neelsen method ) stain culture examination mycobacteria perform least three time . Bronchoscopy also perform bronchial wash transbronchial lung biopsy patient sputum . Isolation Identification Mycobacteria Expectorated sputum sample obtain bronchoscopy examine AFB stain culture mycobacteria . Colony number count incubation long 8 week . Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates identify ( Gen-Probe Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test ; Gen-Probe , San Diego , Calif ) , NTM species identification confirm use polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method base rpoB gene ( 16 ) . In case , sputum examination bronchoscopic sample obtain within 6 month CT . Diagnostic Criteria The diagnosis definite NTM pulmonary infection determine patient fulfilled 1997 American Thoracic Society diagnostic criterion , include clinical , radiologic , microbiologic criterion ( 1 ) . Probable NTM pulmonary infection diagnose patient satisfied clinical radiologic criterion 1997 American Thoracic Society diagnostic criterion fully satisfy microbiologic criterion . Namely , patient either one two culture positive organism specifically identify NTM smear result negative AFB three culture positive NTM without precise specie identification ; addition , patient symptoms radiologic evidence disease , consist bilateral bronchiectasis bronchiolitis . A diagnosis pulmonary tuberculosis make patient culture positive M tuberculosis . The clinical diagnostic criterion diffuse panbronchiolitis follow ( 17 ) : ( ) symptoms—chronic cough , sputum , dyspnea exertion ; ( b ) physical signs—crackles rhonchi ; ( c ) chest radiographs—diffusely disseminate fine nodular opacity , mainly low zone lung , hyperinflation lung ; ( ) lung function study , least three follow four abnormalities—forced expiratory volume 1 second less 70 % , vital capacity le 80 % predict value , residual volume 150 % predict value , partial pressure oxygen ( arterial ) less 80 mm Hg . When definite cause identify evaluation causative factor , patient receive diagnosis bronchiectasis nonspecific bronchiolitis . Chart Review The medical record patient review one author follow information , available : height , body weight , history tobacco use , history previous antituberculous treatment , result AFB staining , isolation identification mycobacteria , number NTM-positive isolates . Imaging Evaluation Chest radiologists retrospectively evaluate chest CT scan . The observer unaware microbiologic test result final diagnosis ; A total six lung lobe patient ( lingular segment consider separate lobe ) assess presence lung lesion abnormal finding . Each lobe lung evaluate regard presence absence bronchiectasis , well-defined small nodule ( &lt; 10 mm diameter ) , branch centrilobular nodule ( ie , tree-in-bud pattern ) . Bronchiolitis define presence well-defined small nodule branch centrilobular nodule chest CT scan . The extent involvement bronchiectasis bronchiolitis estimate count number involve lobe . The presence abnormality , include nodule ( 10-30 mm diameter ) , lobular consolidation ( consolidation 10-20 mm diameter polygonal shape ) , segmental consolidation , cavity , volume reduction , also record . Comparison Patients NTM Disease Patients Non-NTM Disease After classification patient accord previously mention diagnostic criterion , patient categorize two group : NTM pulmonary infection group , include patient definite probable NTM pulmonary infection , non-NTM pulmonary infection group . Comparisons clinical chest CT find patient NTM diseases patient airway disease determine . Statistical Analysis Values express mean ± standard deviation . By stratify age distribution include patient accord birth sex decade patient ' age , investigator test whether statistically significant difference distribution use χ2 test . All continuous variable test normality Kolmogorov-Smirnov test , Gaussian distribution . To statistically evaluate difference continuous variable two group , investigator use unpaired test . Frequencies analyze use χ2 test Fisher exact test , appropriate . A difference P value less .05 consider statistically significant . Statistical software ( SPSS 11.0 ; SPSS , Chicago , Ill ) use throughout .</detailed_description>
