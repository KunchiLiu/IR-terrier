	<brief_summary>The robotic thyroidectomy ( RT ) excellent cosmetic several functional result . But definite evidence oncological safety robotic thyroidectomy yet . To assure surgical completeness robotic thyroidectomy , investigator compare robotic thyroidectomy conventional open thyroidectomy ( OT ) mean postoperative radioactive iodine ( RAI ) uptake possible remnant thyroid tissue stimulate TG level .</brief_summary>
