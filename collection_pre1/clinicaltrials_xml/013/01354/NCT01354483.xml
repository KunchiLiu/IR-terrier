	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Blood Mononuclear Cell Transplant Treat Chronic Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label dose-escalating clinical trial . 20 patient randomly divide 5 group , 4 patient per group . The first three group four patient receive transplant increase dose HLA-matched umbilical cord blood mononuclear cell , start 4 spinal cord injection 4µL cell suspension Group A 8µL Group B 16µL Group C. If one subject show neurological loss attributable cell injection , trial fall back previous dose . In Group D , high volume cell cause neurological deficit ( e.g . 16µL x4 ) along single bolus 30 mg/kg methylprednisolone sodium succinate ( MPSS ) provide . Subjects Group E receive treatment Group D plus 6-week course oral lithium carbonate . All subject enroll three month intensive rehabilitation cell transplant .</detailed_description>
