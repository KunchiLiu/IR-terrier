	<detailed_description>One early manifestation macular telangiectasia type 2 ( `` MacTel '' ) acquire reduction and/or redistribution macular pigment carotenoid foveal center . Currently , biochemical mechanism clinical significance underlying change know , seem likely well understanding phenomenon could lead new intervention MacTel . Dr. Bernstein 's laboratory Moran Eye Center University Utah focus past fifteen year role macular pigment carotenoid , lutein zeaxanthin , maintain macular health . These xanthophyll carotenoid derive exclusively diet , especially green leafy vegetable orange-yellow fruit vegetable . They think protect macula light-induced oxidative damage virtue light-screening antioxidant property . Dietary supplement product , infant formula aim senior , primarily contain lutein ; however central macula ( fovea ) actually show high concentration zeaxanthin . Dr. Bernstein 's lab identify characterized binding protein responsible uptake stabilization lutein zeaxanthin macula , develop new , noninvasive method quantify image carotenoid retina many non-ocular tissue , participate intervention trial lutein zeaxanthin age-related macular degeneration . As lead site identification MacTel family North America part `` MacTel Project '' , Dr. Bernstein researcher University Utah unique expertise biochemistry biophysics macular pigment carotenoid may help hasten progress toward effective diagnosis intervention MacTel highly collaborative manner . Macular Pigment Imaging : Dr. Bernstein extensive experience various method image quantify macular pigment live human eye , especially use autofluorescence imaging ( AFI ) resonance Raman imaging ( RRI ) . Dr. Bernstein also currently utilize method evaluate age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) patient participate `` AREDS2 '' study . The objective study two-fold : 1 . To image macula MacTel subject use two-wavelength autofluorescence imaging ( AFI ) resonance Raman imaging ( RRI ) target 7-degree radius pigment ring characteristic macular telangiectasia type 2 order gain insight significance early clinical sign ; 2 . To evaluate whether supplementation oral zeaxanthin normalize macular pigment distribution MacTel subject . This open-label pilot study enroll ten patient affect macular telangiectasia type 2 evaluate every six month two year . All participant take 20 mg zeaxanthin supplement per day duration study . Macular pigment distribution determine use two-wavelength autofluorescence image resonance Raman imaging .</detailed_description>
