	<brief_title>Reduced Contractile Reserve : Therapeutic Target Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction ( HFpEF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure preserve ejection fraction ( HFpEF ) difficult disease diagnose due nonspecific symptom clinical finding . The disease occur elderly , often illnesses sign age make diagnosis heart failure difficult . Recently , suggest HFpEF , primarily think diastolic disease , fact multifactorial , element abnormal systolic function increase vascular stiffness play role disease pathology . No treatment show reduce high mortality disease . However , study evaluate population patient period increase physiologic stress , despite consistent clinical presentation impair exercise tolerance symptom rest . This study explore multifactorial physiology HFpEF , detailed investigation specificity abnormality contractile reserve vascular stiffness disease , exploration modifiability abnormality . The technique use non-invasive , involve echocardiographic evaluation cardiac function , measurement arterial stiffness use tonometry . The first aim study explore specificity potential diagnostic test HFpEF investigate change ejection fraction β-adrenergic stimulation low-dose dobutamine HFpEF compare group important distinguish clinically , specifically patient shortness breath due pulmonary disease , hypertension leave ventricular hypertrophy without clinical heart failure . In second aim , study investigate ability calcium channel blocker , amlodipine , restore normal contractile response myocardium . In third aim , role arterial stiffness drug response HFpEF explore . It anticipate improved understanding complex physiology multifactorial disease gain study lead rational design large clinical trial study promise agent HFpEF impact diastolic function , contractile reserve arterial property well .</detailed_description>
