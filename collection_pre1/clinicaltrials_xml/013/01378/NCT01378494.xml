	<brief_summary>Utilizing extremely well-characterized HIV cohort observation ART-naïve since first exposure HIV treatment , investigator conduct cross-sectional study prospectively collect data determine BMD 200 subject . Subjects identify initially treatment naïve enter University Alabama Birmingham ( UAB ) 1917 HIV Clinic 1999 2010 ; observation without treated ART therapy others newly start ART therapy observation . For subject , investigator determine association BMD 1 ) cumulative viremia , 2 ) ART duration , 3 ) ART type . Hypothesis 1a : BMD low HIV+ subject high level cumulative viremia . Hypothesis 1b : BMD great HIV+ person long duration ART therapy , exclude subject treat tenofovir . Hypotheses 1c : BMD low subject treat tenofovir vs. ART agent , control duration therapy . Additionally , investigator conduct retrospective study 100 patient HIV+ ART-naïve time entry 1917 Clinic investigator longitudinally evaluate relationship HIV viral load , inflammation , bone turnover ( measurement HIV copy-years viremia , interleukin-6 { IL-6 } , tumor necrosis factor alpha { TNF-a } , high-sensitivity c-reactive protein { hsCRP } , osteocalcin , urine C-telopeptide { CTX } ) . The investigator compare HIV patient similar stage disease remain treatment naïve ( either due concern compliance sufficient CD4 count without treatment ) ( ART- ) vs. newly start ART ( ART+ ) . Hypothesis 2 : Viral load , marker inflammation , marker bone resorption decrease ART+ vs. ART- person .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The life expectancy person infect HIV improve greatly since institution combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) . However , many metabolic derangement discover long-term cART therapy , include lipodystrophy , insulin resistance , , recently , abnormal bone metabolism . It well document bone mineral density ( BMD ) HIV+ patient low compare expect BMD non-HIV patient [ 1-10 ] . The underlying cause lower BMD unknown felt multifactorial process [ 10-14 ] . Current guideline recommend first line treatment consist combination protease inhibitor ( PI ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) combination two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) . Despite known change BMD HIV+ person , less known effect antiretroviral ( ART ) exposure duration treatment , ART type , cumulative HIV viremia bone health . This demonstrated study show loss BMD use protease inhibitor compare regimen [ 15 ] , study show detrimental effect NRTIs [ 6 , 9 , 16 ] , yet others show BMD improve ART therapy [ 17 ] . Tenofovir ( NRTI ) , particular , implicated play role bone change , possibly due effect proximal tubule lead Fanconi-like syndrome phosphate waste [ 18 ] . Tenofovir lead significant reduction BMD child loss reverse tenofovir stop [ 9 ] ; study show similar deleterious effect [ 16 ] . A recent study evaluate effect continuous ART therapy vs. intermittent use viral suppression show patient receive continuous ART great loss BMD , despite increase risk AIDS progression , myocardial infarction , renal- liver-failure [ 19 ] . However , prior longitudinal study longer follow-up show initial loss BMD follow ART recover longer-term BMD change similar change see HIV-negative person [ 20-22 ] . There evidence positive correlation HIV viremia proinflammatory cytokine up-regulated proinflammatory cytokine may play role osteoclast osteoblast function . Prior study show HIV infection osteoblast osteoclast function uncouple follow ART treatment , regulation bone turnover formation ensue [ 23 ] . However , change cytokine correlate BMD change bone turnover routine ART treatment , knowledge . Most study date cross-sectional study compare HIV+ ( vary ART exposure history ) HIV- person small longitudinal study limit sample size short duration . It known decline proinflammatory cytokine occur concurrent fall HIV viral load lead improved regulation bone formation hence lower rate bone loss low risk fracture .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All treatment naïve patient see 1917 Clinic January 1 , 1999 December 31 , 2010 identify . Of patient , currently care time initiation study ( &gt; 1 clinic visit past 12 month ) eligible ( regardless current use ART treatment ) . Patients history chronic renal failure ( estimate GFR &lt; 30ml/min ) exclude study . In addition , patient know diagnosis metabolic bone disease ( i.e . osteoporosis , primary hyperparathyroidism , Paget Disease , Osteogenesis Imperfecta ) , multiple myeloma , cancer , untreated thyroid disease , inflammatory bowel disease , person currently treat plan begin osteoporosisspecific medication ( include estrogen ) exclude participation . Patients treat oral glucocorticoid anticonvulsant also exclude .</criteria>
