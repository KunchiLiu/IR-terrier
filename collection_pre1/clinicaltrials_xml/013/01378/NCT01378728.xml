	<detailed_description>Introduction Rationale : Wound care major clinical challenge present enormous burden health care worldwide . As wound ( chronic acute ) heal , number key biological change occur wound site tissue cellular level . Among inflammation , reformation epidermal barrier , remodel connective tissue dermis . However , common major complication arise wound heal process , range day month , bacterial infection . This result serious impediment heal process lead significant complication , especially chronic non-healing wound . Currently , standard wound care include monitor possible infection direct visual inspection white light take sample analysis laboratory take approximately two day provide result . However , qualitative visual assessment provide gross view wound site ( i.e. , presence purulent material crusting ) provide critically important information underlying change occur tissue cellular level ( i.e. , infection , matrix remodeling , inflammation , necrosis ) . All chronic wound contain bacteria . But whether wound bacterial balance ( contamination organisms surface colonization organism tissue arrange micro colony without cause damage ) bacterial imbalance ( critical colonization infection ) primary importance healing . It important note continuum bacterial presence proÂ¬gressing bacterial balance bacterial damage chronic wound . The diagnosis infection typically make clinically base sign symptom around local wound bed , deep structure , surround skin . The presence severity bacterial infection typically diagnose base clinical appearance wound white light ( i.e. , pain , purulent exudate , crust , swell , erythema , heat ) . A major problem bacterial contamination within around wound determine directly visualization bacteria white light , base clinical sign symptom cause bacterial contamination and/or infection within wound ( i.e. , pain , purulent exudate , crust , swell , erythema , heat ) . The remodel heal connective tissue wound involve simultaneous synthesis degradation collagen fibril . These bacteria include common specie typically find wound site ( i.e. , Staphylococcus Pseudomonas specie ) . Bacterial swab collect time wound examination advantage provide identification specific bacterial/microbial specie quantification bacterial burden . However , often , multiple swab collect randomly wind site target , swab technique may spread microorganisms around wound collection process , thus affect patient healing time morbidity . This may problem especially large chronic ( non-healing ) wound detection yield bacterial presence suboptimal , despite collection multiple swab . Furthermore , bacteriological culture result often take 2-4 day come back laboratory , thus significantly delay diagnosis treatment . Thus , bacterial swab provide real-time detection infectious status wound . In addition , although wound swab appear straightforward , lead inappropriate treatment , patient morbidity increase hospital stay perform correctly . An image-based method allow real-time monitoring wound healing , particularly early dermal connective tissue remodeling , presence bacterial contamination and/or infection time could significant clinical impact . Autofluorescence image use gastroenterology image collagen bacterial fluorescence clinical study . We wish expand use tissue autofluorescence image technology wound care management order provide obtain biologically relevant information wound site tissue biomolecular level real-time healing process . When used ass wound , tissue autofluorescence may aid determine degree wound heal presence bacterial infection . In preliminary preclinical testing , discover wound illuminate specific wavelength combination excitation light , endogenous tissue component emit characteristic fluorescent signal , bacteria emit unique fluorescence signal . We recently develop innovative optical molecular image platform base high-resolution fluorescence white-light technology hand-held , real-time , high-resolution , non-invasive ( e.g . non-contact ) format . This invention offer real-time detection important biological molecular information wound first time , could significant impact improve conventional wound care management . Based extensive preclinical testing , propose technology capability collect autofluorescence image wound detect presence relative change connective tissue content biodistribution involve wound heal . It also detect early indication bacterial/microorganism contamination within wound ( occult standard white light visually-based assessment ) , thus provide measure infection status . This could significantly impact clinical wound care management ) reduce complication associate missed detection bacteria infection , ii ) facilitate image-guided swabbing/biopsy iii ) monitor wound healing time . Furthermore , compact portable design image device platform make ideal clinical wound care environment well point-of-care use home-health care visit . Study Objectives Specific Aims The primary objective clinical study evaluate use effectiveness 'handheld ' fluorescence digital image device platform real-time non-invasive clinical monitoring chronic wound heal bacterial contamination/infectious status time . This enable u determine device detect longitudinally track intrinsic change may occur wound heal process include , limited , collagen re-modeling bacterial infection wound site . As secondary objective , wish obtain valuable end-user data clinical utility device within wound clinic environment . This information use optimize subsequent version device product development . Most importantly , hope conclusively verify added value image device brings traditional wound care practice , extent change gold standard . Specific Aims : 1 . To determine fluorescence image device detect change connective tissue time correlate wound heal re-modeling , compare change wound size time . 2 . To determine effectiveness fluorescence image device detect presence ( contamination ) bacteria around wound ( include infection ) , compare standard best practice method ( e.g . white light visualization clinical sign symptom , swab bacteriology 'gold standard ' ) . 3 . To identify relationship autofluorescence image tissue bacteria wound ( include wound margin ) following : ) clinical sign infection , ii ) microbial load ( i.e. , number organism per gram wound tissue ) , iii ) diversity microbial specie wound ( i.e. , number different specie isolate per wound ) , Gram signing .</detailed_description>
