	<brief_summary>Asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common disease , tend even increase many country . Both clinical pathophysiological point view , important issue . However , understand relationship complex array cell mediator involve asthma COPD yet fully dissect make difficult find specific sensitive panel biomarkers reflect intensity pathological process help predict individual outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : To evaluate pattern pathophysiology genetic predisposition COPD asthma Tasks : To evaluate patient respond corticosteroid Compare inflammatory marker : - COPD asthma patient treatment inhaled glucocorticoid - COPD asthma patient respond inhaled glucocorticoid - nonsmoker smoker asthma patient To identify small set marker use predict corticosteroid-treatment response patient COPD . To evaluate epigenetic factor To compare gene mutation polymorphism study group To evaluate relationship genetic predisposition pathophysiology , clinical symptom To evaluate relationship pattern pathophysiology clinical symptom , lung function , quality life patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Visit 1 Written inform consent obtain - A full medical , surgical , smoking , labour history . A physical examination perform - Resting SaO2 measure , exhale nitric oxide ( FENO ) - Chest X-ray - Patient fulfil questionnaires - Spirometry bronchodilatation test - Sputum induction sample perform Visit 2 • Blood sample blood clot test immunological marker taken• Cough inhalation challenge Visit 3 - Patient hospitalize Department Pulmonology Immunology - Blood sample genetic analysis take - Urinary sample taken• Methacholine challenge test Polysomnography - Bronchoscopy ( biopsy BAL ) - Study drug administration Visit 4 5 - Adverse event , COPD asthma exacerbation , concomitant medication record , exhale nitric oxide ( FENO ) - Spirometry - Patient fulfil questionnaires - Cough inhalation challenge Visit 6 - Patient fulfil questionnaires - Spirometry bronchodilatation test . - Sputum induction sample perform Visit 7 • Blood sample blood clot test , immunological genetic analysis taken• Cough inhalation challenge Visit 8 - Patient hospitalize Department Pulmonology Immunology - Urinary sample taken• Methacholine challenge test Polysomnography - Bronchoscopy ( biopsy BAL ) - Further treatment administration</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female outpatient age 4080 year inclusive . An established clinical history COPD define GOLD guideline . COPD patient baseline ( prebronchodilator ) FEV1 4080 % predict normal value ; postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio ≤ 70 % predict . COPD patient smoke history ( current exsmoker ) ≥10 pack year exposure occupational dust chemical An establish clinical history asthma define GINA recommendation . Subjects hypoxemia ( subject must O2 saturation ≥88 % room air ) . Control ( healthy ) subject baseline FEV1 &gt; 80 % predict normal value A female eligible participate study nonchildbearing potential , childbearing potential negative pregnancy test . Patients use inhaled oral corticosteroid 6 week and/or long act bronchodilator 4 week study . There current respiratory disorder COPD asthma ( e.g . lung cancer , sarcoidosis , active tuberculosis etc . ) Subjects COPD asthma exacerbation respiratory infection 4 week Visit 1 . Subjects chest Xray indicate diagnosis COPD asthma might interfere study . Subjects unable stop treatment inhale , oral corticosteroid 6 week and/or long act bronchodilator 4 week study . Subjects receive treatment cromolyn sodium nedocromil , oral beta2 agonist , long act anticholinergic , leucotriene modifier Subjects lung surgery . Subjects bleed diathesis . Subjects receive treatment longterm oxygen therapy . Subjects serious , uncontrolled disease uncontrolled permitted therapy .</criteria>
