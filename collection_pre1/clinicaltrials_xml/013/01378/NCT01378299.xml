	<brief_summary>Testosterone ( T ) replacement prevents bone loss relief symptom associate androgen deficiency male patient hypogonadism , expense increase prostate-related adverse event hematocrit value normal may lead bad circulatory outcome . Most effect T male skeleton mediate conversion estradiol ( E2 ) enzyme aromatase . Genetic variation aromatase ( CYP19A1 ) gene result enzyme variable activity variable level E2 T. This project design determine genetic variation CYP19A1 gene result difference skeletal response incidence side effect T treatment patient low T. A large number male Veterans T. Results project help identify patient would benefit therapy risk side effect , would definitely impact future care patient male patient general genetic profiling becomes part standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Estrogen gain recognition primary hormone regulate male skeleton . Estrogen males mainly derive conversion testosterone estradiol enzyme aromatase . Polymorphisms aromatase gene ( CYP19A1 ) report result variable enzyme activity result variable hormonal profile difference bone mineral density ( BMD ) among variant . These polymorphism also find influence change BMD response hormone therapy postmenopausal woman bone loss aromatase inhibitor woman breast cancer . It possible polymorphism also influence skeletal response testosterone therapy hypogonadal male give testosterone . Among side effect describe testosterone therapy , prostate-related event increase hematocrit represent common potentially serious side effect . However , side effect affect everybody , suggest certain subgroup patient predisposed side effect . Because polymorphisms CYP19A1 gene result difference activity among variant lead variable substrate product accumulation , investigator hypothesize polymorphisms influence skeletal response perhaps susceptibility side effect testosterone therapy . Thus objectives proposal : ( 1 ) To evaluate influence polymorphism CYP19A1 gene skeletal response testosterone male patient low testosterone , ( 2 ) To evaluate influence polymorphism CYP19A1 gene susceptibility side effect testosterone therapy , ( 3 ) To evaluate change functional activity aromatase enzyme clinically significant CYP19A1 gene polymorphism . The investigator propose treat 105 patient testosterone cypionate 200 mg IM every 2 week 18-month treatment period . The investigator serial measurement BMD dual energy X-ray absorptiometry , marker bone turnover , hematocrit , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) , prostate volume hormonal assay . Changes BMD marker bone turnover testosterone treatment compare among different CYP19A1 genotype . The investigator also compare change hematocrit , PSA prostate volume among different CYP19A1 genotype . Changes functional activity among variant evaluate CYP19 gene expression study adipose tissue obtain periumbilical fat biopsy , change estradiol testosterone ratio , surrogate marker aromatase activity . The investigator anticipate variant increase activity relatively higher estradiol level less active variant result great increment BMD . Meanwhile , less active variant relatively high level testosterone variant great increment hematocrit . On hand , variant associate high estradiol testosterone ratio experience great increase PSA prostate volume therapy . The incidence testosterone deficiency go age presence co-morbid condition make male hypogonadism one common problem among patient attend VA clinic , part , elderly various co-morbid condition . Indeed , large number VA patient already take testosterone hypogonadism , primarily prevent bone loss . It possible patient derive benefit drug subject potential serious side effect . Results proposal identify genetic profile favorable responder poor responder might prone serious side effect , thus , may impact future care male Veterans hypogonadal patient general , genetic profiling becomes part standard care .</detailed_description>
