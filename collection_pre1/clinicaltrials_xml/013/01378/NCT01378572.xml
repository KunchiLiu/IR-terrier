	<brief_summary>With present study investigator intend identify morphologic electrophysiologic substrate marker increase arrhythmic risk patient dilate cardiomyopathy undergoing implantation defibrillator primary prevention sudden cardiac death . Moreover , investigator also aim identify electrophysiological substrate modification time first arrhythmic event patient . To aim , investigator prospectively correlate electroanatomic mapping cardiac magnetic resonance finding arrhythmic event , order identify substrate marker increase arrhythmic risk patient dilate cardiomyopathy , therefore likely benefit defibrillator implantation . Furthermore , electroanatomic mapping repeat time first arrhythmic event compare baseline , order evaluate electrophysiological substrate change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A correct identification patient high risk sudden cardiac death crucial rational clinical management , since demonstrate effectiveness implantable cardioverter-defibrillators reduction sudden cardiac death . Basing result multiple clinical trial , leave ventricular systolic function , measure ejection fraction , currently recommend tool identify patient high risk sudden death would benefit prophylactic defibrillator . However , systematic implementation current recommendation result substantial number inappropriate defibrillator implantation , fail prevent majority sudden death occur general population . Unfortunately , present time way identify patient high risk sudden cardiac death , since propose risk marker consistently demonstrate incremental value . Recent data suggest several substrate marker , either assess morphologically magnetic resonance imaging , electrophysiologically invasive mapping procedure , may helpful identify subgroup patient higher arrhythmic risk . However , previous study largely conducted patient , retrospective short follow-up . We submit patient dilate cardiomyopathy undergoing implant implantable cardioverter defibrillator morphologic electrophysiologic substrate evaluation include cardiac magnetic resonance gadolinium contrast-enhancement study , electroanatomic mapping bipolar electrogram voltage morphological analysis . The electroanatomic mapping cardiac magnetic resonance repeat time first arrhythmic event . We expect define role anatomical electrophysiological substrate abnormality determine malignant ventricular arrhythmia patient dilate cardiomyopathy , thus allow good risk stratification prevention sudden death .</detailed_description>
