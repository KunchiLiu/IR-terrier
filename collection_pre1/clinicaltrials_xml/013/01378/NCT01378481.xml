	<brief_summary>This study do determine investigational cancer treatment call vorinostat combine fractionate stereotactic radiation therapy ( FSRT ) effective treat recurrent high grade glioma . The main goal research study determine high dose vorinostat give patient recurrent tumor . The study also determine potential side effect safety treatment combination . Vorinostat small molecule inhibitor histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) . HDAC inhibitor help unravel deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) cancer cell make susceptible treatment radiation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Vorinostat Fractionated Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine phase II dose intermittent short-course vorinostat combine fractionate radiation therapy recurrent high-grade glioma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Define pharmacokinetics vorinostat entry cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) demonstrate vorinostat influence glioma biology . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study vorinostat . Patients receive high-dose vorinostat orally ( PO ) 48 , 27 , 3 hour prior surgery . Beginning 2-6 week later , patient receive vorinostat PO daily ( QD ) day 1-3 week 1-2and undergo fractionate stereotactic body radiation therapy day 1-5 week 1-2 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
