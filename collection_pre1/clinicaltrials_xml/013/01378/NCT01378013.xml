	<brief_summary>This work use new approach measure surgery effect human biochemistry metabolism . It create metabolic signature 'phenotype ' surgical injury help clinician choose right surgical treatment individual . This metabolism base individual 's gene , disease burden environmental influence gut microbiota . This study use scientific method base computational analysis spectrum take technique know Mass Spectrometry ( MS ) Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy . This science call 'metabonomics ' many advantage . Firstly , provide measure thousand metabolites single moment time unique individual therefore give 'systems ' overview person metabolism . Secondly able process many hundred sample quickly . The investigator aim integrate investigator metabolic data genetic information patient bacteria wherever possible . This first time 'systems biology ' approach use surgery , potentially significant gain make pre operative risk stratification optimisation . By perform analysis stage surgical journey ( preoperatively , operation surgery ) ensure right treatment give right patient right time . By create longitudinal model biochemical response surgery , predict much early stage patient risk develop complication . This improve outcome surgery . This work use metabonomic approach create new tool surgeon use operation base tissue biology . For example investigator able measure metabolic content tumour real time measure biological content diathermy smoke . This potential change intra-operative decision make improve outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A system perspective improve surgical decision making surgery real time . Specifically , hypothesize may provide diagnostic prognostic information importance accurate current biochemical approach . This account important environmental influence surgical outcome pharmacotherapy gut microbiota . The secondary hypothesis approach provide real time molecular feedback operator surgery tissue type pathology . This work therefore need study patient surgery range different condition state , vary type surgical intervention . It known patient cancer example quite different metabolic requirement without . This significant implication development personalize management strategy patient cancer undergo surgery . It essential study definitively prove technology able make description patient significantly different disease state also differentiate type magnitude surgical procedure perform timing surgery . Therefore , work involve heterogeneous patient cohort . Study design : This study subject research governance structure provide internally within department Biosurgery Surgical technology conjunction section Biomolecular medicine safe use sample machinery . It also possess clinical steer committee ass progress , clinical outcome , safety timely completion work . Two separate clinical group recruit trial . The first patient undergo elective procedure , second undergoing emergency procedure . Each group contain subcategories clinical condition , upon study focus . Elective surgery ( n=200 ) : A . Patients cancer . This include patient malignancy gastrointestinal colorectal tract ( include excise microsurgery ) cancer breast solid tumor kidney . B . Patients benign disease bowel require surgery e.g . inflammatory bowel disease C. Benign surgical condition , usually operate day surgery setting . These specifically biliary tree ( gall stone ) anterior abdominal wall ( e.g . Hernia surgery ) Patients recruit see 'two week ' wait rule suspect cancer general surgery , upper GI surgery , Breast Urology surgery team St. Mary 's hospital outpatient set . Patients attend elective inpatient surgery general , upper GI breast surgery team St. Mary 's hospital , London recruit pre admission clinic . Acute surgery ( n=200 ) Patients present Accident emergency care general surgery call team recruit study group . This study group follow subgroup : A . Acute abdominal pain , per previous ethical clearance B . Patients acute sepsis think surgical origin . C. Patients suffer major trauma Injury severity score &gt; 15 , multiple injury , require surgery &gt; 1 organ system fail admitted intensive care department . Exclusion criterion : All patient age 18 year All patient pregnant Patients receive Advanced Life Support cardiopulmonary resuscitation arrival hospital . Patients advance cancer suitable palliative care presentation clinical team . Patients present first time know malignancy receive treatment e.g . Prostate cancer Patients already recruit clinical study . This study break two separate phase : Preclinical work : Preclinical work biofluid analysis elective acute surgical admission already perform animal human study Magic Angle Spinning ( MAS ) -1H NMR ( also know solid state NMR tissue require preparation ) , MS , Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization ( MALDI ) -MS . Samples previous study gain ethical clearance analyze use technique methodological optimization . This entail metabonomic metagenomic profiling colorectal cancer sample ( Ethics Ref : 07/H0712/112 06/Q0403/16 ) sample take patient acute pancreatitis acute abdomen ( Ethics Ref : 05/Q0403/201 ) . Non essential ( i.e . Benign pathologically normal tissue ) excise due incineration take consent patient routine surgery collect analysis : Mass spectrometry smoke plume collect range electrocautery device . This allow optimization MS protocols define chemical parameter normal tissue various tissue type . b. Malignant tissue excise breast , colon upper GI cancer test capacity detect normal malignant disease use intelligent knife ex vivo . This perform guidance histopathologists , interfere pathological stag treatment cancer . Development translational software analytical interpretation complex biochemical metadata non scientific staff develop use data . This work use current intensive care clinical database . Clinical work : The aim technology readily applicable patient surgery within NHS . Therefore , patient recruit two surgical pathway : Acute Care : Patient recruitment Patients recruit whilst Accident Emergency . Only patient admit via route eligible study inclusion . Patients provided information sheet patient leave 30 minute consider study . Consent take private , adequately qualify trained individual . When consent , patient ask complete questionnaire provide medical surgical history , metabolic information could influence result . It possible gain consent case patient may unconscious unable consent due injury . In case sample take , patient gain consciousness capacity formal consent take . If stage , patient state want include study sample withdraw . In event patient 's death , sample include study . This capacity test predict mortality primary end point . Elective Care : Patient recruitment Patients recruit outpatient set ever possible ensure adequate time take board clinical information consent . We sample patient admission hospital treatment decision surgery make . Sample Collection : Samples collect set time point patient journey case . Samples obtain time standard clinical investigation minimize discomfort patient , take excess standard sample time prevent unnecessary investigation patient . Sample collection coordinate clinical biochemistry team St. Mary 's hospital ever possible prevent unnecessary time consume sample . Pre operation : Plasma urine collection : 1 . At arrival Accident Emergency . Every 24 hour duration admission surgery , discharge treatment define surgical , radiological invasive therapeutic intervention . If patient remain hospital prolonged rehabilitation non surgical therapy , sample take weekly discharge . Stool sample First bowel motion arrival A+E . Preoperative pre bowel preparation sample surgery . This give either clinic ward . Tissue sample collection Preoperative biopsy In event patient send routine endoscopic biopsy , sample tissue take metabonomic analysis . b. Intra-operative . Analysis smoke plume MS perform case . This interfere standard operation operate surgeon ask make decision base data experiment . In case cancer resection , tissue sample collect keep within principal oncological surgery . In case breast surgery , sentinel lymph node also harvest analyzed NMR . During colorectal surgery , tissue mesorectum take analysis standard collection point upper GI cancer resection , similar principal apply sample . In acute emergency situation , tissue also take area tissue think risk ischemia ( e.g . anastomotic site bowel join ) . Stool small bowel effluent harvest time surgery effect surgery gut microbial ecosystem also account . c. Post operative . Urine plasma sample daily post operatively keep current clinical practice first week . Where ever possible , extra sample collect beyond sampled clinical staff . Stool sample also collect . The first bowel motion collect surgery , motion first week complete , weekly . The first motion stoma / ileostomy : If stoma sit , daily sample take first week . Weekly sample collect discharge . In event patient return theatre , sample collection sequence commence . All clinical data record duration patient stay . This refer pre operative information assessment possible , physiological data , radiological finding , clinical biochemistry , surgical clinical outcome length stay . This anonymous cod . On discharge , patient buy back clinic 8 week clinical assessment per routine analysis . Samples urine , blood stool take time . Oncological patient follow five year per oncology protocol St. Mary 's Hospital Paddington .</detailed_description>
