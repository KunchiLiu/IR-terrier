	<brief_summary>Wilson 's disease autosomal recessive genetically inherit disorder copper metabolism , cause neurological , psychiatric liver disease . The ATP7B gene 13th chromosome responsible disease . Liver critical role copper metabolism . It main site copper accumulation bile secretion physiologic way copper elimination . Due defective production ceruloplasmin carry copper , wide amount free copper precipitate throughout body particularly liver , eye brain . Patients bound lifelong chelate agent penicillamine , trientine tetramine dihydrochloride . Unfortunately , medication may cause severe side-effects hypersensitivity reaction , bone marrow suppression , auto-immune disease sideroblastic anemia . Medical treatment liver cirrhosis , last stage illness lead morbidity mortality Wilson Disease , difficult . Liver transplantation still effective treatment patient liver cirrhosis Wilson Disease . However , serious problem accompany liver transplantation . Lack liver donor , complication surgery , graft rejection high cost main problem . There cell human body capable renew differentiate diverse range specialize cell type . These call `` stem cell '' . Stem cell differentiate specialized cell appropriate medias laboratory . Recently , differentiation potential mesenchymal stem cell hepatocytes prove demonstrate hepatocytes contain Y chromosome female bone marrow transplantation male donor . In many laboratory study , observe human bone marrow derive mesenchymal stem cell , transplant animal induce liver damage , differentiate albumin produce hepatocytes without fusion . By study , understood mesenchymal stem cell potent bone marrow element context differentiation hepatocytes . Even though number study human purpose , finding support animal experiment . Mesenchymal stem cell non-immunogenic . Safety feasibility allogeneic transplantation individual without need immunosuppressive drug regimen proven . Proofs correct metabolic defect way also present publication . For reason mention , allogeneic mesenchymal stem cell transplantation promise treatment modality especially hereditary metabolic disease . By way , non-immunogeneic mesenchymal stem cell healthy genetic structure , manufacture require enzyme , repopulated damage tissue contribute clinical improvement . In study , mesenchymal stem cell derive healthy volunteer donor 's bone marrow expand in-vitro , 1 million cell per kg infuse patient liver cirrhosis relate Wilson disease , 50 million cell via hepatic artery remain cell via peripheral vein . It aim enable liver regeneration , decrease fibrosis rate , improve patient 's health condition , increase ceruloplasmin synthesis , ameliorate disorder copper metabolism , decrease need chelate agent , increase living standard patient , prolong wait time liver transplantation . Finally aim establish new regenerative treatment protocol alternative liver transplantation . For observation clinical laboratory improvement , patient plan monitored histopathologic examination liver biopsy 6th month treatment , monthly biochemical hematologic blood test periodic radiologic examination . This hopeful , avant garde sophisticate study may constitute new horizon context cellular therapy .</brief_summary>
