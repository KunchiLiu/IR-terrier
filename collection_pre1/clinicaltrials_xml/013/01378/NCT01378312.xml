	<brief_summary>This Phase I study conduct randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study healthy adult subject HIV-negative , BCG-vaccinated , evidence tuberculosis infection . The study conduct one clinical research site India . The available live tuberculosis vaccine , Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) , provide incomplete protection pulmonary tuberculosis . For unknown reason , BCG revaccination `` booster '' , toxic , provide much additional protection . AERAS-402 present tuberculosis antigens set new , live , replication-deficient adenovirus vaccine may increase T cell-mediated immunity thus protection tuberculosis . Since BCG-vaccinated individual population AERAS-402 might indicate , AERAS-402 administer individual already vaccinate BCG .</brief_summary>
