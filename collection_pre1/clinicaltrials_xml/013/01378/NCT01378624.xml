	<brief_title>Ex Vivo Effect Surfactant Protein D Pulmonary Cells Patients With Asthma Pilot Study Assess Local Inflammation Induced Segmental Allergen Challenge Magnetic Resonance Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect surfactant protein D native alter condition investigate immune cell derive bronchoalveolar lavage patient allergic asthma follow segmental allergen challenge . The goal study elucidate pro- versus anti-inflammatory function SP-D molecule identify motifs SP-D treatment potential allergic asthma assess local inflammation induce segmental allergen challenge magnetic resonance imaging . In addition patient allergic asthma subgroup five healthy subject include study elucidate specificity SP-D ( surfactant protein-D ) effect allergic inflammation invitro model . The primary objective study isolate BAL cell different invitro experiment assess local inflammation segmental allergen challenge MRI response apply allergen dose . Therefore , follow baseline BAL , allergen ( 2× individual dose , 1× one tenth individual dose ) saline ( 1× ) instill four different lung segment first bronchoscopy . After 24 hour second bronchoscopy BAL collect challenged segment harvest invaded cell invitro experimentation . In addition , bronchial biopsy epithelial brush take assess degree local inflammation bronchial mucosa study activation airway epithelium follow allergen challenge .</detailed_description>
