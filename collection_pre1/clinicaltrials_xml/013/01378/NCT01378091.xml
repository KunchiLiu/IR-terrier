	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To determine maximum tolerated dos ( MTDs ) daily lenalidomide docetaxel give every three week prednisone , combination therapy subject androgen independent prostate cancer To evaluate safety profile combination daily lenalidomide every three week docetaxel prednisone give subject androgen independent prostate cancer Secondary objective : To explore anti-tumor activity combination daily lenalidomide every 3 week docetaxel prednisone give subject androgen independent prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Lenalidomide Docetaxel Subjects With Androgen Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adenocarcinoma prostate second leading cause cancer death men . There medication available help treat disease , typically lengthen life 10 12 month . More recent study show average survival 20 23 month . The investigator hope experimental ( research ) drug call lenalidomide ( Revlimid® ) , use study , lengthen live patient even time . A different drug drug family demonstrate activity variety solid tumor well hematological malignance . It work cancer different way chemotherapy affect immune system ( body 's ability naturally fight disease ) . The investigator believe study drug help build patient ' immune system popular drug market , may potentially increase survival rate patient hormone refractory prostate cancer .</detailed_description>

Patients must metastatic prostate cancer unresponsive refractory androgen blockade one follow criterion : Progression unidimensionally measurable disease . Progression non measurable disease Rising PSA ( absolute value PSA &gt; 5 mg/ml ) . Rising PSA define least 2 consecutive rise PSA document reference value ( measure 1 ) . The first rise PSA ( measure 2 ) must take least 7 day reference value . A third confirmatory PSA require , must obtain least seven day second measure . If third measure confirm rise PSA , fourth PSA measure require take confirm rise second measure . Patients treat antiandrogens flutamide , hormonal agent estrogen , ketoconazole must stop least 28 day prior enrollment . In case nilandron bicalutamide , treatment agent must stop least 42 day prior treatment . If patient treat corticosteroid , dose stable 14 day prior study entry ECOG performance status ≤2 ( Appendix I : ECOG Performance Status Scale ) . Regarding Lenalidomide : Men must agree use latex condom sexual contact FCBP even successful vasectomy . All patient must counsel minimum every 28 day pregnancy precaution risk fetal exposure . See Appendix V : Risks Fetal Exposure , Pregnancy Testing Guidelines Acceptable Birth Control Methods , AND also Appendix VI : Education Counseling Guidance Document .
