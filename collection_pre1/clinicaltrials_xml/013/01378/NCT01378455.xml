	<brief_summary>Visual perception impairment upper limb disability affect handwrite performance . Children cerebral palsy ( CP ) good function upper extremity may associate visual perception impairment , impact handwrite performance . However , study investigate handwrite problem child CP good upper limb function . To date , study investigate effectiveness computerized handwrite training program handwrite performance child CP . The aim study establish relationship visual perception , visual motor integration , motor coordination handwrite performance child typical development ( TD ) Taiwan , establish norm handwrite performance child TD Taiwan , compare handwrite performance child CP child TD , clarify relationship visual perception function handwrite performance child CP , examine effectiveness interactive computerized handwriting training program ( ICHTP ) handwrite performance child CP . The investigator collect 90 child TD 48 child CP 1st phase . All child receive clinical Chinese handwrite assessment tool ( CHAT ) assessment . The CHAT ICHTP modify Taiwan-version handwrite assessment tool training program child Taiwan , respectively . Clinical assessment include visual perception , visual motor integration , fine motor skill , handwrite performance . The CHAT assess handwrite legibility , accuracy , pen pressure write speed . In 2nd phase , investigator collect 48 child CP , randomly classify ICHTP group Traditional Handwriting Training Program ( THTP ) . All child CP receive clinical CHAT assessments intervention . The expected result study visual perception function relate handwrite performance child CP , improvement handwrite legibility , accuracy , pen pressure write speed ICHTP training group great THTP train group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study establish relationship visual perception , visual motor integration , motor coordination handwrite performance child TD Taiwan , establish norm handwrite performance child TD Taiwan , compare handwrite performance child CP child TD , clarify relationship visual perception function handwrite performance child CP first phase , examine effectiveness interactive computerized handwriting training program ( ICHTP ) via randomize control study child CP second phase.The subject ninety child typical development age 6-12 year elementary school forty-eight child CP age 6-12 year Chang Gung Memorial Hospital ( Taipei branch , Linkou branch , Taoyuan branch , Kaohsiung branch ) , Far Eastern Memorial Hospital , Taipei Veterans General Hospital Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital ( Taipei branch ) etc.Experimental design In first phase , establish relationship visual perception , visual motor integration , motor coordination handwrite performance child TD Taiwan , establish norm handwrite performance child TD among different age group Taiwan , comparison design study compare handwrite performance among 2 CP group TD group . All child assign diplegia group , hemiplegia group , typical development ( TD ) group . Then assessment fine motor skill , visual perception handwrite performance occupational therapist . Experimental procedure : All child assess clinical assessment Chinese handwrite assessment tool ( CHAT ) . Clinical assessment include Manual Ability Classification System ( MACS ) , Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Motor Proficiency-second edition ( BOT-II ) , Test Visual-Perceptual Skills Revised ( TVPS-R ) , Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test Visual-Motor Integration ( Berry VMI ) comprehensive test basic reading writing . Evaluations perform 1.5-2 hour silent restful room , eliminate factor fatigue distraction attention concentration , could impact result . All test use study individually administer child . The performance child videotape later score . In second phase , CP child randomize assigned ICHTP group THTP group . All participation receive clinical CHAT assessments intervention . Clinical assessment include Manual Ability Classification System ( MACS ) , Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Motor Proficiency-second edition ( BOT-II ) , Test Visual-Perceptual Skills Revised ( TVPS-R ) , Beery-Buktenica Developmental Test Visual-Motor Integration ( Berry VMI ) comprehensive test basic reading writing . Evaluations perform 2 hour silent restful room , eliminate factor fatigue distraction attention concentration , could impact result . All test use study individually administer child . The performance child videotape later score . The intervention consist ICHTP THTP training program , 45 min/once , three times/one week , sustain four week .</detailed_description>
