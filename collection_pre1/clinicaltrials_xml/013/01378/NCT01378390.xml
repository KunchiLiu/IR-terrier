	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Adipose-Derived Stem Cells Treat Complex Perianal Fistulas Patients With Crohn 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complex perianal fistula source great distress suffers . In Crohn 's disease , option limit , surgery often associate incontinence recurrence . The biological property stem cell derive adult tissue make candidate treatment pathology require tissue regeneration diseases heal process alter . A proof-of-concept study , phase 1 study phase 2 study [ Clinicaltrials.gov identifier : NCT00115466 ] suggest approach promising , even patient whose fistula associate Crohn 's disease . The present multicenter , placebo-controlled , phase 3 study aim confirm efficacy safety show previous phase 1 phase 2 study treatment complex perianal fistula patient Crohn 's disease 24 week initial administration . Fistula closure define absence suppuration external orifice complete re-epithelization external orifice absence collection &gt; 2cm directly relate fistula tract treat , measure MRI .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed informed consent Patients Crohn 's disease diagnose least 12 month early accordance accept clinical , endoscopic , anatomopathological and/or radiologic criterion Presence complex perianal fistula 3 few fistulous tract assess MRI Patients persistent active complex perianal fistula nonactive luminal Crohn 's disease define CDAI ≤ 200 . ( Complex perianal fistula define fistula meet one follow criterion : High fistula [ high intersphincteric , high transsphincteric , extrasphincteric suprasphincteric ] , presence 3 few external opening [ tract ] associate complex perianal fistula , pain/fluctuation Good general state health accord finding clinical history physical examination Women childbearing age negative serum urine pregnancy test ( sensitive 25 IU hCG ) . Both men woman use appropriate birth control method define investigator Presence severe proctitis ( prominent friability , spontaneous bleeding , multiple erosion , deep ulcer ) dominant active luminal disease require immediate therapy , assess rectosigmoidoscopy Patients CDAI ≥201 Patients abscess unless complete toilet area drainage collection absence abscess collection confirm prior treatment start The presence seton unless remove prior study procedure Presence &gt; 3 fistulous tract and/or external opening Patients rectal and/or anal stenosis evaluate rectoscopy EUA Patients receive infliximab antiTNF agent 8 week cell treatment administration Patients receive tacrolimus cyclosporine 4 week cell treatment administration Patients rectovaginal fistula , anal fistula ( ) , and/or nonperianal enterocutaneous fistula Patients HIV , HBV , HCV treponema infection , whether active latent Patients history abuse alcohol addictive substance 6 month prior inclusion Patients malignant tumor , except basal cell cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma , patient prior history malignant tumor , unless neoplastic disease remission previous 5 year Patients cardiopulmonary disease , opinion investigator , unstable sufficiently serious exclude patient study . Patients type medical psychiatric disease , opinion investigator , could ground exclusion study Patients congenital acquire immunodeficiency Patients abnormal laboratory test finding contraindicate inclusion study Patients allergic local anesthetic gadolinium ( MRI contrast ) MRI unfeasible , ( e.g . due presence pacemaker , hip replacement severe claustrophobia ) Liposuction extraction least 100 cm3 fat abdominal wall technically unfeasible patient consent procedure Patients need surgery perianal region reason fistulas time inclusion study , need surgery foreseen region 26 week treatment administration . Patients suffer major surgery severe trauma prior 6 month Pregnant breastfeed woman Patients wish comply study procedure Patients currently receive , receive within 1 month prior enrolment clinical trial , investigational drug Patients unlikely comply study procedure</criteria>
