	<brief_summary>In first year , subject receive clinical assessment include subjective assessment , basic data , nutritional status fitness assessment . Laboratory assessment include body composition , bone density ( lumbar spine femur dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ) , bone strength ( calcaneal ultrasound ) bone metabolism . In 2nd year , randomize three group . The high level training group ( 20 child ) receive high frequency fitness training program ( Frequency : three time one week , Duration : thirty minute ) . The low level training group ( 20 child ) receive low frequency fitness training program ( Frequency : two time one week , Duration : thirty minute ) .The control group ( 20 child ) receive fitness training program maintain usual life style . In 3rd year , subject receive post-training clinical assessment include subjective assessment , basic data , nutritional status fitness assessment . Laboratory assessment include body composition , bone density ( lumbar spine femur dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ) , bone strength ( calcaneal ultrasound ) bone metabolism . These data provide study could establish bone quality fitness data child diplegic CP , provide u plan treatment strategy management bone fitness problem future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Relationship Bone Strength Fitness Training Children With Cerebral Palsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malnutrition motor impairment common child cerebral palsy . Poor nutrition motor impairment may contribute fitness impairment , low bone mineralization density ( BMD ) , low bone strength , even fracture child CP . To management bone problem base understand pathophysiology bone mineralization bone strength CP . Multiple factor , include nutritional factor ( eg . nutritional status , body composition ) non-nutritional factor ( eg . fitness , immobility , use anticonvulsant ) may potentially impact bone density/strength child CP However , study investigate relationship bone strength fitness child cerebral palsy Taiwan . We hypothesize fitness training may potentially impact bone density/strength child CP . The purpose study find relationship bone quality fitness training child CP . We collect 60 child diplegic CP . The inclusion criterion include good cognition comprehend command cooperation examination fitness training . The exclusion criterion follow chromosomal abnormality , active medical condition pneumonia others , poor tolerance assessment fitness training . In first year , subject receive clinical assessment include subjective assessment , basic data , nutritional status fitness assessment . Laboratory assessment include body composition , bone density ( lumbar spine femur dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ) , bone strength ( calcaneal ultrasound ) bone metabolism . In 2nd year , randomize three group . The high level training group ( 20 child ) receive high frequency fitness training program ( Frequency : three time one week , Duration : 40 minute ) .The low level training group ( 20 child ) receive low frequency fitness training program ( Frequency : 1-2 time one week , Duration : 40 minute ) . The control group ( 20 child ) receive fitness training program maintain usual life style . In 3rd year , subject receive post-training clinical assessment include subjective assessment , basic data , nutritional status fitness assessment . Laboratory assessment include body composition , bone density ( lumbar spine femur dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ) , bone strength ( calcaneal ultrasound ) bone metabolism . These data provide study could establish bone quality fitness data child diplegic CP , provide u plan treatment strategy management bone fitness problem future .</detailed_description>
