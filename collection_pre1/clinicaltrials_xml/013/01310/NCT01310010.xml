Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy negative pregnancy test , maximum 48 hour prior study drug start . Participants - exclusion criterion : 1 . Patients ECOG 3-4 study entry 2 . Any following laboratory abnormality : - Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.5 x 109/l platelet &lt; 75 x 109/l - Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dl ( 177 mmol/l ) . - Serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase ( SGPT ) &gt; 5,0 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . - Total bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dl . 3 .

Uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease , include myocardial infarction within 6 month , uncontrolled angina within 3 month , prolong QT interval , congestive heart failure within 3 month clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia 10 . Any psychiatric condition could prevent patient signing inform consent could put patient unacceptable risk case participate trial 11 . Subjects enrol another clinical trial study entry . If patient receive investigational agent , minimum 30 day wash-out period must elapse . Primary Outcome measure The primary objective study assess efficacy dasatinib maintenance term Disease Free Survival 2 year patient Ph+ ALL receive maintenance dasatinib allogeneic SCT . Secondary Outcome measure .To ass efficacy maintenance dasatinib term duration hematologic , cytogenetic molecular remission , Relapse rate 2 year , survival 2 year , overall DFS , Overall Survival ( OS ) . ·To assess safety tolerability dasatinib maintenance regimen allogeneic SCT Regarding secondary objective `` To assess safety tolerability dasatinib maintenance regimen allogeneic SCT '' , safety analysis include frequency adverse event laboratory abnormality well frequency dose interruption , dose reduction treatment discontinuation drug-related toxicity . Frequency table report use `` All treated subject '' dataset . Safety report treated patient assess baseline finding , AEs SAEs ( definition , pattern , seriousness intensity accord NCI CTCAE v3.0 , relationship dasatinib outcome ) . Hematologic toxicity analyze separately .</detailed_description>
