	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction research question Although systematic review suggest potential effectiveness in-service learning ( i.e . volunteer ) youth development approach prevent teenage pregnancy , intervention involve toddler-mentoring previously evaluate . Teens Toddlers ( T &amp; T ) intervention enable young people risk teenage pregnancy spend time mentor toddler well participate counsel classroom work focus youth development . This trial aim answer follow research question : 1 . What effect T &amp; T intervention participant ' use contraception last sex , sex without contraception previous 3 month , expectation teenage parenthood youth development ( primary outcome ) one year intervention delivery ? 2 . What effect T &amp; T intervention participant ' experience teenage pregnancy , use condom last sex , sex without condom previous 3 month , emotional self-reflection emotional vocabulary , dislike school knowledge contraception ( secondary outcome ) one year intervention delivery ? 2 . Intervention , set participant The T &amp; T intervention deliver 22 site south-east , north-east north-west England . Each site comprise nursery secondary school . Participants recruit two cohort ( September 2009 February 2010 ) . Participants parent ask give informed consent participate young woman survey baseline , randomise intervention control group ( see ) . 3 . Sample size Our power calculation focus primary outcome , contraception use last sex previous 6 month , anticipate 25 % prevalence among comparison group follow-up 2 , inform previous Ripple trial . Assuming prevalence , order detect halve risk ( range effect report example Safer Choices CAS-Carrera study ) 80 % power 95 % precision would require sample 180 per arm . In addition , 120 girl recruit baseline act potential reserve girl allocate receive T &amp; T intervention drop intervention first 8 week . Where drop-out occur , girl drop intervention match pair comparison group would nonetheless remain trial analytic sample order minimize selection bias . A reserve pair school , one randomize replace drop-out intervention one allocate comparison group , would augment drop-outs analytic sample . Any girls drop T &amp; T 8 week replace intervention also remain trial analytic sample . The sample recruit participating school . Each school recruit young woman group ( one two group per year-cohort depend size school level involvement ) . The average size group 12 girl 6 randomise T &amp; T 6 control group ( additional 4 girl recruit reserve every group , half would necessary randomise T &amp; T half randomise control group ) . 4 . Randomisation Within school , girl complete baseline assessment put match pair base age sexual experience . Then give random number use computer-based random number generator . Within pair , girl low number would select Teens Toddlers programme girl high number would comparison group . The reserve pair would select similar way , pair would give random number . The two pair low random number would become reserve pair , six pair high random number would form main pair evaluation . This randomisation process do use anonymised data remotely Offices National Centre Social Research . Notification girl ' allocation send school teacher inform girl . Neither girl , teacher intervention provider blind allocation . Research data collection analysis staff blind allocation . 5 . Outcome measure We pre-hypothesised primary secondary outcome order avoid bias 'data-dredging ' significant result . We try balance sufficient breadth reflect potentially broad benefit participation T &amp; T programme , need reduce possibility false-positive result arise multiple test statistical significance . Full question available request . All measure pilot within independent sample young people interview regard understand meaning question mean response . These outcome measure follow-up 2 ( 72 week ) via pen paper self-completion questionnaire survey do exam condition classroom supervise two researcher teacher present . 6 . Data collection method Participants survey baseline , end programme ( 20 week ) one year programme complete ( 72 week ) . Girls offer Â£10 voucher girls intervention comparison group completion questionnaires . A repeat visit school make survey student miss previous visit . Multiple form contact information also take student repeatedly miss , move , school track . 7 . Analysis There plan interim analysis do inform whether stop rule implement time analysis follow-up 2 data cohort 1 available cohort 2 already experience intervention . Analysis effect estimate do 'intention treat ' basis participant control originally recruit study plus reserve bring programme augment drop-outs include analysis regardless attendance programme . Logistic regression use estimate effect size binary outcome ANOVA continuous measure . Each generate crude adjust estimate , latter adjust significant ( P &lt; 0.1 ) baseline difference socio-demographic measure baseline value outcome measure . 8 . Governance The trial manage executive group consist researcher National Centre Social Research London School Hygiene Tropical Medicine meet monthly . The Trial Steering Group function fulfil committee comprise representative research team , funders ( Department Education ) , provider ( Teens Toddlers ) well two independent member ( Meg Wiggins , Senior Research Fellow , Social Science Research unit , Institute Education Sally Hopewell , Senior Research Fellow , Centre Statistics Medicine , University Oxford ) . This group meet quarterly scrutinise trial design method ass data quality . This group thus include within function data monitoring committee .</detailed_description>
