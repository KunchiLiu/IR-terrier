	<detailed_description>By conservative estimate , Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) common disorder occur least 3 6 % school-aged child ( Barkley , 1990 ) . It mark symptoms inattention hyperactive-impulsive behavior developmentally inappropriate . These symptom must occur multiple setting impair function clinically significant degree ( DSM-IV ; American Psychiatric Association , 1994 ) . ADHD believe developmental disorder begin early childhood , distinguish disorder attention behavioral control arise later consequence brain injury . Although ADHD think affect child , considerable evidence accumulate show ADHD frequently continue adulthood . Approximately 60 % ADHD youth ( 3-4 % adult ) clinically significant residual problem adult ( Faraone , 1999 ; Hechtman , 2000 ; Mannuzza &amp; Klein , 1999 ) . Although inattention problem appear persevere adulthood unchanged , study suggest person ' ADHD hyperactive/impulsive symptom diminish following teenage year . However , mechanism decrease currently know ( Wender , 1987 ; Weiss &amp; Hechtman , 1986 , 1993 ; Brown , 1995 ) . Expert consensus hold deficit response inhibition core feature ADHD ( Barkley , 1998 ) . Supporting , neuropsychological research suggest ADHD person ' commonly perform poorly task require inhibition response . These task , call Go/No-Go Stop Signal task , require continual manual respond successively present stimulus occasionally withhold response follow predefined signal . Numerous neuropsychological study show ADHD child , teen , adult respond variably Go trial task . They also longer reaction time failures inhibit response No-Go trial ( Koshack et al. , 2003 ; Oosterlaan , et al. , 1998 ; Wodushek &amp; Neumann , 1999 ) . Psychostimulant medication like methylphenidate improve performance deficit ( Bedard et al. , 2003 ) . The link abnormality brain structure/function cognitive test performance ADHD person well-established , poorly understood . There evidence small right frontal lobe volume , abnormality basal ganglia size , reduction white matter tract person ADHD ( Castellanos et al. , 1994 ; Castellanos et al. , 1996 ; Filipek et al. , 1997 ; Hynd et al.,1993 ; Mataro et al. , 1997 ) . Prefrontal cortex basal ganglion involve planning , initiation , execution , supervision ongoing cognitive motor function ( Fuster , 1997 ) . Structural brain abnormality correlate deficit cognitive function impulsive behavior symptom ADHD ( Casey et al. , 1997 ; Mataro et al. , 1997 ; Semrud-Clikeman et al. , 2000 ) . Functional imaging technique , quantify neural system operation respect cognitive process , particularly valuable tool use characterize dysfunctional neural network . The frequently employ method electrophysiology , small voltage change scalp occur task performance record averaged waveform depict brain function event interest . These average EEG waveform call event-related potential ( ERPs ) . ERPs Go/No-Go task well characterize healthy , non-clinical sample ( Logan , 1994 ) . The frequently observed component No-Go trial large negative potential occur approximately 275 msec follow stimulus presentation ( N2 ) fronto-central distribution . The large N2 interpret reflection early response inhibition process . Electrophysiological study find large N2 often see successful inhibition diminish ADHD child adolescent ( Overtoom et al. , 2002 ; Pilszka et al. , 2000 ; Yong-Liang et al. , 2000 ) . A literature review reveals comparable study ADHD adult , degree N2 abnormality old ADHD person know . ERP source localization suggest No-Go N2 arise activity inferior prefrontal cortex ( Bokura , 2001 ; Pliszka , 2000 ) . The FMRI study ADHD consistent finding ( Garavan et al. , 1999 ; Liddle et al. , 2001 ; Watanabe et al. , 2002 ) . Rubia et al . ( 1999 ) find less brain activity right superior-lateral prefrontal cortex , right inferior prefrontal cortex , leave caudate nucleus unmedicated ADHD adolescent boy relative control . Vaidya et al . ( 1998 ) report similar finding ADHD child , also show methylphenidate increase activity striatum ADHD participant . These result support fronto-temporal N2 decrease ADHD brain area implicated structural study abnormal . Durston colleague also find evidence compare non-ADHD , ADHD child also activate diffuse network posterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex region subserve successful response inhibition ( Durston et al. , 2003 ) . Increasing age also significantly alters pattern activity see Go/No-Go task healthy , non-ADHD person brain region . Children activate volume prefrontal cortex compare adult ( Casey et al. , 1997 ) . There also evidence healthy adult teenager use different neural network achieve comparable response inhibition task performance ( Rubia et al. , 2000 ) . Healthy adult show modulation ventral prefrontal activity depend task difficulty , whereas child appear maximally activate area generally ( Durston et al. , 2002 ) . In sample ADHD participant age 8 20 , age find correlate positively leave inferior frontal cortex , correlate negatively hemodynamic activity leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( Tamm et al. , 2002 ) . In word , increase use cortex know primary substrate response inhibition , reliance cortex primary substrate work memory `` on-line '' cognitive process decrease age . These difference suggest age important variable understanding response inhibition neural activity ADHD non-ADHD person . Age-related change behavior cognitive functioning typically interpret within developmental framework . Researchers hypothesize age-related improvement neural function ( i.e. , increased neural connectivity functional specialization ) responsible improvement ADHD hyperactive/impulsive symptomatology . A body evidence indirectly support contention . Adults adolescent developmentally distinct regard brain structure function . Structural MR study consistently show increase white matter volume throughout early childhood early adulthood ( Caviness et al.,1996 ; Giedd et al. , 1999 ) reflect increase connectivity among cortical area , especially reciprocal connection prefrontal posterior brain area ( Goldman-Rakic , 1987 ) . Gray matter see increase linear fashion puberty decrease adolescence brain region . These curve peak frontal parietal lobes age 12 , temporal lobes age 16 , occipital lobes increase 20 ( Giedd et al. , 1999 ) . These finding parallel histological animal vivo study human brain development show sharp reduction syntapogenesis puberty , follow period synaptic pruning continue similar rate throughout middle adulthood ( Bourgeois , 2001 ) . These change presumably reflect shape brain structure/function follow experience ( Purves , 1988 ) , change likely reflect continue performance improvement cognitive test throughout adolescence . The juxtaposition change brain structure/function ADHD behavior adolescence adulthood raise possibility two might link . Furthermore , factor directly relate , link observable study focus core impairment ADHD ( i.e. , response inhibition ) across different age group . Two position arise field developmental neurobiology explain ADHD symptom diminish . First , researcher hold brain area crucial behavioral inhibition ( i.e. , ventral prefrontal cortex ) may continue mature , albeit delay . Second , possible , unimpaired cognitive mechanism develop compensate behavioral inhibition system impairment . Among others , candidate compensatory mechanism include stimulus evaluation work memory process . Because lack research , neither position great support current time ; moreover , two possibility incompatible . However , question crucial understanding pathophysiology ADHD . Figure 2 ( right ) depict two possible relationship response inhibition development term ERP N2 amplitude . In Figure 2A , diminish N2 see ADHD youth could hypothesize resolve increase age . Alternatively ( Figure 2B ) , may gain response inhibition N2 neural function . Rather , cognitive process measure different ERP index may reflect development compensatory neural mechanism older ADHD person , reflect P3 . Summary Previous research show response inhibition measure Go/No-Go task abnormal age ADHD person , methylphenidate improves performance alters neural function . When electrophysiological index response inhibition ( i.e. , N2 ERP ) compare No-Go success failure trial , ADHD person show difference relate automatic process involve response inhibition think involve prefrontal brain activity . This conclusion support fMRI study localize No-Go hemodynamic response inferior lateral prefrontal cortex medial cortex ( i.e. , anterior cingulate premotor cortex ) . Therefore , N2 measure strength inhibitory neural processing , likely reflect activity brain structure know abnormal ADHD respect structure hemodynamic function . However , electrophysiology yet use measure behavioral inhibition ADHD adult , compare ADHD adult youth . This study use electrophysiology determine whether age-related difference ADHD symptom expression relate difference brain activity involve response inhibition . Furthermore , quantify ADHD brain function psychostimulant medication , possible determine age influence ADHD person ' neural response methylphenidate . We broadly hypothesize methylphenidate affect group ' ERPs differently . Medication-related difference also observe ADHD symptom severity neuropsychological test performance . Innovations include first electrophysiology study 1 ) response inhibition ADHD adult , 2 ) attempt directly link brain function change symptomatology change maturation , 3 ) examines medication effect cognition behavior across age group ADHD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ADHD diagnose base DSMIV criterion ADHD combine subtype ADHD . Combined subtype ADHD require least 6 9 possible symptom within HyperactiveImpulsive symptom cluster Inattentive symptom cluster . This assess use information gather KSADSPL interview either potential participant parent , publish self parentreport ADHD symptom rating scale ( Brown , 1996 ; Barkley , 1998 ) . Predominantly Inattentive ADHD person include . The Predominantly Inattentive subtype subject much theoretical debate , clear person represent unitary disorder , neurobiologically similar combinedsubtype ADHD ( Millich et al. , 2001 ) . To aid proper ADHD diagnosis , potential participant administer battery neuropsychological test . Potential ADHD participant undergo test unmedicated . This battery include IQ , attention memory test ( WASI , Trail Making , Symbol Digit , Stroop Test , Rey AVLT ) , well several measure executive function know sensitive cognitive deficit observe ADHD sample ( Kaplan &amp; Stevens , 2002 ) . Normal performance cognitive test know sensitive ADHD exclude participant study . Full Scale IQ score WASI 80 120 exclude participant participation . Diagnostic interview use SCIDIV ( First et al. , 1996 ) use obtain detailed psychiatric history . Lifetime current history major Axis I psychiatric disorder , include bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , substance dependence disorder , obsessivecompulsive disorder , exclude potential participant . These disorder may better explain presence attention symptomatology , DSMIV criterion indicate precludes ADHD diagnosis . In addition , disruptive behavior disorder module KSADSPL use evaluate presence childhood Conduct Disorder adult Antisocial Personality Disorder ( ASPD ) . These diagnosis also exclude participation , condition may well associate different abnormality prefrontal brain function ( Bauer , 1997 ; Stevens et al. , 2001 ) . Potential participant also exclude report history head injury ( e.g. , loss consciousness &gt; 10 min ) , seizure disorder , life threaten disease , family history schizophrenia , uncorrected visual auditory deficit , condition contraindicate MRI ( claustrophobia , metal body , pregnancy , etc. ) . Up 25 % person ADHD suffer learn disorder ( Tannock &amp; Brown , 2000 ) . Because educational failure prevalent group , include people study . While strict inclusion criterion exclude many potential participant , necessary ensure homogenous participant population varies presence absence ADHD . Only ADHD person regularly prescribe classic psychostimulant ( Ritalin , dexedrine , etc ) recruit . This confirm person show beneficial therapeutic response stimulant characterize use brain function measurement . While prevent comparison brain activity response among various medication , simplify interpretation result . Finally , subject exclude take adjunctive medication ADHD symptom ( e.g. , Wellbutrin , etc . ) another psychoactive medication .</criteria>
