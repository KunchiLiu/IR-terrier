	<brief_summary>Initially group paramedic train perform FAST ( Focused Abdominal Scan Trauma ) scan . The paramedic enter simulated mass causality incident triage patient . Volunteers study include peritoneal dialysis patient ( `` non stable '' ) non-peritoneal dialysis patient ( `` stable '' ) . They use ultrasound perform FAST scan patient determine subject `` stable '' `` unstable '' patient . They record patient consider need transport first . This data use evaluate accuracy speed FAST scan . When paramedic identifies free fluid within volunteer , able make decision upgrade patient ultimately transport quickly . The paramedic evaluate time accuracy FAST scan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use FAST ( Focused Abdominal Scan Trauma ) Scan Paramedics Mass Casualty Incidents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasound FAST ( Focused Abdominal Scan Trauma ) scan currently use Emergency Department help evaluate trauma patient . In field paramedic use START ( Simple Triage Rapid Treatment ) triage procedure evaluate many patient help decide patient critical therefore need transport first . This study aim create mass casualty environment use 10 volunteer peritoneal dialysis 10 patient .</detailed_description>
