	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate whether relation bone mineral density lower limb expose vibration muscle strength gain knee extensor flexor , relation serum sclerostin level muscle strength gain knee extensor flexor healthy young adult woman . Forty healthy young adult woman plan include study . The participant meeting criterion randomize two group : training group ( 20 case ) Control group ( 20 case ) . The whole-body vibration ( WBV ) train group train WBV platform ( Power Plate ) 5 time week 4 week period . Participants ask stand upright WBV platform . Training volume train intensity low beginning progress slowly accord overload principle . The training volume increase systematically 4-week training period . The training intensity increase increase amplitude ( 2-4 mm ) frequency ( 40 Hz ) vibration . The subject ask report negative side effect adverse reaction train diary . In Control group , sham stimulus perform WBV platform 5 time week 4 week period . Plasma sclerostin level , right leave knee flexor extensor muscle strength measure training period . Isokinetic torque measure Biodex ( Biodex System 3 PRO Multijoint System Biodex Medical Inc. Shirley/NY USA ) extremity-testing system . The right leave low limb bone mineral density ( BMD ) muscle strength measure training period . The BMD evaluate bone densitometer ( Norland XR-46 DXA , USA ) . Sclerostin level measure human sclerostin ELISA kit . The rest muscle electrical activity right leave knee flexor extensor muscle evaluate pre-vibration , post- vibration , vibration . The rest muscle electrical activity measure Powerlab ( data acquisition system , ADInstruments , Australia ) device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Bone Vibration-Induced Muscle Strength Gain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vibration strong osteogenic effect . Vibration-induced bone formation neuronally regulate . Vibration also effectively enhance muscle strength power . Previous study show vibration increase muscle electromyographic ( EMG ) activity . Attempts explain vibration-induced increase EMG activity base tonic vibration reflex . Tonic vibration reflex activate muscle spindle , thereby enhance excitatory drive reflex alpha motoneuron . On contrary , show vibration treatment enhance muscle spindle sensitivity lead presynaptic inhibition muscle spindle group Ia afferent . As alternative tonic vibration reflex , recently describe bone myoregulation reflex suggest potentially explain increased muscle strength electrical activity induce vibration . Based bone myoregulation reflex , bone sensitive mechanical stimulus send mechanical input signal central nervous system neuronally regulate muscle activity . The cyclic mechanical load bone stimulate osteocyte . According bone myoregulation reflex , osteocytes stimulate cyclic mechanical loading , increase occur muscle strength activity may . The rate osteocyte stimulate vibration may determine serum sclerostin level . Sclerostin , protein product SOST gene , osteocyte-specific cysteine knot-secreted glycoprotein potent inhibitor bone formation . Sost/sclerostin level report reduced mechanical stimulation .</detailed_description>
