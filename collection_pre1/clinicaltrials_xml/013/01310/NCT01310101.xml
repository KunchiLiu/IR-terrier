	<brief_summary>The rationale study explore safety efficacy ofatumumab combination dexamethasone ( O-dex regimen ) patient refractory/relapsed CLL . Moreover , hypothesis approach able achieve least response rate compare R-dex regimen ( historical control ; manuscript submit Leukemia ) , maintain low toxicity profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ofatumumab Added Dexamethasone Subjects With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multi-center , non-randomized , phase II study evaluate safety efficacy ofatumumab add dexamethasone subject relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia . The treatment give minimum 3 cycle , best response , maximum 6 cycle . After completion treatment phase patient , survival disease status assessment perform 1 month post treatment , every 2 month 3 year . The patient followed-up study 3 year progression . Dose schedule Cycle 1 : Ofatumumab : 300 mg i.v . infusion day 1 cycle Ofatumumab : 2000 mg i.v . infusion day 8 , 15 , 22 ; Dexamethasone : 40 mg/day p.o. , day 1-4 15-18 ; Cycles 2 6 ( cycle every 28 day ) : Ofatumumab : 1000 mg i.v . infusion day 1 , 8 , 15 22 cycle ; Dexamethasone : 40 mg/day p.o. , day 1-4 15-18 . Response assess accord IWCLL guideline . The investigator assessment response progression consider primary endpoint describe study . Safety treatment evaluate : adverse event , laboratory test , vital sign , electrocardiogram performance status . Study Endpoints Primary Endpoint : Overall response rate ( CR , CRi , PR rate ) Secondary Endpoints : Toxicity , tolerability , adverse event ( event assess investigator independent reviewer key time-points ) Overall survival Progression-free survival Time response duration response Time progression time next therapy Other/Exploratory Endpoints : Exploratory molecular genetic , immunophenotypic , cytogenetic pharmacologic marker</detailed_description>
