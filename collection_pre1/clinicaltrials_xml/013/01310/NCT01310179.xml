	<brief_summary>This study test whether possible introduce new genetic material small portion tumor product new gene kill tumor cell infect initially , also surround tumor cell well limited harm patient . The desired effect approach achieve focusing potent chemotherapy directly within tumor , result , avoid injury remainder body . In study , use two component , first virus , know adenovirus , cripple ( i.e. , make ) load bacterial gene call E. coli purine nucleoside phosphorylase ( PNP ) . Adenoviruses consider relatively safe vehicle gene delivery presently use numerous human trial therapy worldwide , include head neck cancer therapy approve use outside United States . The loaded adenovirus use deliver PNP gene directly tumor patient . This gene expect effect . However , gene produce PNP inside tumor protein activate second component therapy , drug call fludarabine phosphate , approve FDA certain type blood-cell cancer , show effective solid tumor . The propose therapy give patient several infusion fludarabine follow injection virus carry PNP gene , fludarabine enters tumor , convert PNP second compound , fluoroadenine . Numerous study mice rat show fluoroadenine potent anti-cancer agent kill tumor cell make well immediately surround area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Adenovirus/PNP Coupled With Fludarabine Phosphate Treat Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For first study , inject PNP-loaded adenovirus tumor patient cancer primarily throat neck give drug . This study design two goal mind : 1 ) assess overall safety approach patient ; 2 ) observe effect anti-cancer strategy tumor . This accomplish two part . First , introduce modest , fixed amount gene-carrying adenovirus tumor three separate group patient administer small , increasingly strong amount fludarabine phosphate successive group three-day period . Even group receive high amount fludarabine , total amount give individual patient three day significantly less dose approved FDA patient non-solid tumor . Finally , concentrate amount adenovirus ( approximately 10 time virus ) give fourth group patient also receive high dose drug show well tolerate prior three group ( high dose serious problem observe ) .</detailed_description>
