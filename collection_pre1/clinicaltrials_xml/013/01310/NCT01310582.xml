	<brief_summary>Numerous study demonstrate patient improve immediate recovery characteristic follow desflurane anesthesia compare volatile agent , include sevoflurane . There limited evidence literature suggest patient undergo sevoflurane , compare desflurane anesthesia , may suffer limitation function cognitive ability undetermined , prolonged period time follow surgery . These difference explain pharmacokinetically may result direct neurotoxic effect sevoflurane . An unresolved question time require ability return complex task , drive , follow anesthesia . Commonly , patient advise drive make important decision 24 hour follow anesthesia , well-studied proscribed empiric , rather scientific , basis limit data available.This study well define recovery characteristic characterize severity duration cognitive impairment follow sevoflurane desflurane anesthesia brief outpatient urologic surgery elderly female use test cognitive ability couple performance drive simulator cognitive task test objectively measure test performance , also cognitive effort perform test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recovery Following Desflurane Versus Sevoflurane Outpatient Urologic Surgery Elderly Females</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following IRB-approved consent , 60 patient randomize ( 63 patient enrol account &lt; 5 % screen failure &lt; 5 % drop patient rate ) receive either desflurane sevoflurane-based anesthetic pelvic floor repair . The selection anesthetic gas ( sevoflurane desflurane ) determine computer generate randomization . Only Anesthesiologist CRNA know gas administer subject . All investigator co-investigator collect research data blind gas selection . Potential subject identify clinic visit Urology Department Hahnemann University Hospital . On morning surgery , study investigator medical doctor ask subject perform baseline cognitive task test determine baseline thinking process . The detailed description cognitive task follow ; 1 . Mini-Mental Status Exam ( MMSE ) : ( 10-15 minute ) This 30-item measure global cognition ( Folstein , Folstein &amp; McHugh , 1975 ) test orientation time place , object naming , repetition , attention , recall , follow complex command . 2 . Trail Making Test Part A Part B : Part A ( 3 minute ) measure ( Army Individual Test Battery , 1944 ; Reitan &amp; Wolfson , 1985 ) test visual attention subject must draw line page connect 25 consecutive number quickly possible . Part B ( 5 minute ) require subject alternately sequence number letter randomly distribute page ascend alphabetical order quickly possible . 3 . Digit Symbol Coding : ( 2 minute ) This subtest WAIS-III ( Wechsler , 1997 ) consist nine digit-symbol pair follow list digit . Under digit subject must write corresponding symbol quickly possible . 4 . Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised ( HVLT-R ) : ( 8 minute ) Memory verbal information assess list learn task assess immediate delay recall . 5 . Stroop Color Word Test : ( 5 minute ) This test ( Stroop , 1935 ; Golden , 2002 ) measure cognitive control ask subject suppress habitual response favor alternate response . Participants show word ask name color word write Total time expect cognitive task test 28-33 min . If patient ' able drive drive least one year , require perform drive simulation . After perform baseline cognitive task test , baseline drive simulation ( 15 minute ) drive simulator . After baseline Cognitive Task Test Virtual Driving Training session , subject underwent plan surgery . The selection anesthetic gas determine computer generate randomization list . The anesthesiologist CRNA charge subject administer anesthesia . The investigator subject blind anesthetic gas give . At conclusion surgery , anesthetic gas shut co-investigator call OR document time subject take open eye cessation gas . At 30 minute discontinuation anesthetic gas , subject ask repeat set cognitive task test ( 28-33 min ) . And , 2 hour surgery , subject repeat cognitive task test ( 28-33 min ) drive simulation ( 20 min ) patient able drive . On next day surgery , co-investigator telephone conversation subject discharge home surgery . Modified Telephone Interview Cognitive Status ( TICS-M ) use collect data ( 10 minute ) . This 13-item telephone interview ( Welsh , Breitner , &amp; Magruder-Habib , 1993 ) late-life cognitive assessment include test orientation , attention , work memory , praxis , sentence repetition , name verbal description , recent memory , word opposite , additional immediate delay recall 10-word list . The subject ' participation study end follow-up telephone call . The participant follow duration 28 hour . The follow-up participation study end 24-28 hour . From date randomization date first document progression , end participation date death cause , whichever come first , assess 30 day .</detailed_description>
