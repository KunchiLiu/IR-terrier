	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To compare change liver fat content visceral fat mass ( cm2 ) assess MRS ( Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ) MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Image ) , 26 week treatment insulin detemir daily insulin NPH daily metformin overweight obese type 2 diabetic subject . Secondary objective : To compare two treatment respect : 1 . Efficacy : - MRI : abdominal subcutaneous fat mass ( cm2 ) , Calculated Visceral/Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue Ratio . - Change HbA1c baseline 12 26 week treatment . - Change Fasting plasma glucose baseline 12 26 week treatment . - Weight - Waist hip circumference 2 . Safety : - Incidence hypoglycaemia 26 week treatment insulin detemir versus NPH - Lipid profile start 26 week treatment - Incidence Adverse event trial - Safety profile measure laboratory safety parameter ( haematology , biochemistry ) physical examination/vital sign end treatment</brief_summary>

( Trialrelated activity procedure would perform normal management subject . ) Female male , 18 years≤age≤70years Subjects insulin naïve type 2 diabetes treat metformin（＞1g/d）alone least 3 month prior screen 11 % ≥HbA1c≥7.5 % base analysis central laboratory 24kg/m2≤BMI≤40kg/m2 Weight fluctuation &lt; 2kg one month prior screen Able willing perform selfmonitoring blood glucose . Willing accept basal insulin therapy Able selfinject require dose insulin Treatment OADs ( Oral Antidiabetic Drugs ) last 6 month , except metformin ( subject currently treat metformin within interval 10002000 mg daily may include trial . The dose remain unchanged period one month prior randomisation expect remain unchanged throughout trial period ) . Use approve weight lower pharmacotherapy ( e.g . orlistat , sibutramine , rimonabant ) obesity induce drug treatment ( e.g . corticosteroid , NSAIDs , tricyclic antidepressant , atypical antipsychotic ) .
