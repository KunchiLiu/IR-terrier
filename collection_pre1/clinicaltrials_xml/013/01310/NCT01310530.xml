	<brief_title>Partial Breast Proton Therapy Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy deliver whole breast standard treatment follow tumor removal patient early stage breast cancer . In selected patient , deliver radiation treatment part breast involved tumor may viable alternative . This decrease amount normal tissue expose irradiation , potentially decrease side-effects shorten treatment time . Proton beam decrease volume normal tissue treat compare standard form radiotherapy . This study recruit patient early stage breast cancer follow surgical removal undergo partial breast radiotherapy proton beam determine recurrence rate side-effects treatment .</detailed_description>
