	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Cediranib Maleate gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . It yet know whether cediranib maleate give together gefitinib effective cediranib maleate give alone treat patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study side effect give cediranib maleate together gefitinib see well work compare give cediranib maleate together placebo treat patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate With Without Gefitinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - To compare progression-free survival , overall survival , radiological response , safety tolerability cediranib maleate combination gefitinib versus cediranib maleate combination placebo patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma follow standard front-line treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cediranib maleate gefitinib cediranib maleate placebo daily day 1-42 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood tissue sample collect patient genetic profile biomarker analysis .
