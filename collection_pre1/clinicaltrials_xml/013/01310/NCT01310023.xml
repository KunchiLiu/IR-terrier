	<brief_title>Surveillance Monitoring ART Toxicities Study HIV Uninfected Children Born HIV Infected Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) medication give pregnant woman cross placenta detect amniotic fluid cord blood result substantial fetal exposure . Therefore , concern toxicity drug fetus infant . It noteworthy none currently approve ART medication prevention maternal fetal transmission HIV Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) Pregnancy Category A ( fetal risk ascertain adequately control human study ) . Thus , continue need examine toxicity ART HIV transmission prevention short-term toxicity new agent combination well unanswered question long term toxicity subtle adverse effect . The study use registry approach conduct active surveillance among child &lt; 12 year age enrollment . Occurrences abnormality ART exposure utero and/or first two month life seek multiple domain , include metabolic , growth , cardiac , neurologic , neurodevelopmental , behavior , language , hear . Clinical laboratory data examine abnormality hierarchy evaluation : adverse event ( AE ) identify → select AEs trigger predefined additional evaluation → significant observation define case → pattern significant study-wide case define signal . The incidence event interest monitor time ART regimen , compare historical data may suggestive signal . Some signal may testable use exist and/or previously collect data , signal may indicate need additional hypothesis-driven study outside SMARTT . The objective SMARTT : 1 . To estimate occurrence potential ART-related toxicity ongoing surveillance system among HIV-uninfected child bear mother HIV infection without exposure ART utero and/or first two month life compare occurrences outcomes source data well ART exposures ; 2 . To actively encourage hypothesis-driven study confirm signal due ART exposure utero and/or first two month life . Note full design execution study may beyond scope SMARTT study facilitate SMARTT . The specific aim SMARTT : 1 . To create Static Surveillance Cohort extend domain-specific data collection child either 1 ) previously enrol approved study enrollment SMARTT ; 2 ) previously enrol another pediatric HIV/AIDS cohort study SMARTT Protocol Chair approval , 3 ) previously enrol approve study equivalent data available medical record ; 2 . To create Dynamic Surveillance Cohort examine domain-specific data child newly expose ART utero and/or first two month life ; 3 . To create Young Adult Cohort study long-term outcome SMARTT participant formerly enrol Static Dynamic cohort . 4 . To identify set `` trigger '' domain define `` signal '' possible ART toxicity compare occurrence signal previously collect data ART exposure ; 5 . To encourage facilitate development hypothesis-driven study evaluate whether `` signal '' result ART exposure utero and/or first two month life .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Static Surveillance Cohort : HIVexposed uninfected infant child ; lack infection must document medical research record review . Children expose unexposed ART utero and/or first two month life enrol . Previously enrol study include list approve study enrollment SMARTT another study SMARTT Protocol Chair approval study data ART exposure pregnancy trimester , ART exposure first 2 month life , pregnancy complication data availability ART exposure pregnancy trimester ( include start stop date ) , ART exposure first 2 month life , pregnancy complication data mother and/or child 's medical record . Age birth &lt; 12 year entry . Willingness parent/legal guardian provide write permission child participate study . Dynamic Surveillance Cohort : HIVexposed live fetus great equal 23 week gestation live infant bear 22 week gestation . Infants expose unexposed ART enrol . Any infant bear HIVinfected mother may enrol pending determination infant 's HIV infection status . However , infant find HIVpositive discontinue study refer care outside study . HIV infection status determine use Diagnosis Lack Infection HIVExposed Children . ART exposure data trimester pregnancy must available ART expose . Entry prior birth &lt; 72 hour age . Willingness parent/legal guardian provide write permission child participate study . Willingness biological mother enroll initial enrollment child . Young Adult Cohort : 18 year age old , aware perinatal HIV exposure status . Previously enrol SMARTT Dynamic Static Cohort . Willingness provide write consent participate study . Reference Cohort : Participants clinical setting similar participant enrol PHACS SMARTT Static Cohort . Antiretroviral therapy unexposed child born mother HIV uninfected time child 's birth . Ages 1 , 3 , 5 , 9 year ( ± 3 month ) time study visit . Willingness parent/legal guardian provide write permission child participate study . Static Dynamic Cohorts : Young Adult Cohort : Participants enrol Adolescent Master Protocol Participants 18 Years Age Older ( AMP Up ) . Current prisoner status . Reference Cohort : Monolingual Spanishspeaking child parent/caregiver .</criteria>
