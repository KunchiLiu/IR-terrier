	<brief_summary>The purpose study directly compare two method evaluate heart function time angiogram . In method contrast dye inject main heart chamber angiogram x-ray image take . One method use automatic power injector deliver normal volume contrast ; method use hand injection low volume contrast main heart chamber . It hypothesize hand injection prove accurate method estimate ejection fraction ( EF ) time radial coronary angiography compare directly Power LV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hand Injected Ventriculography vs. Power Injected Left Ventriculography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Left ventriculography routine accurate method evaluate leave ventricular ejection fraction ( EF ) time coronary angiography . Power inject left ventriculography ( Power LV ) use standard volume ( 36 ml 3 second ) contrast 5 Fr . angle pigtail catheter leave ventricle currently routine clinical practice leave heart catheterization via radial artery . With coronary angiography radial approach increase popularity grow interest hand inject leave ventriculography ( Hand LV ) use low volume ( 8ml ) contrast 5 Fr . radial angiographic catheter . Potential benefit method include reduce contrast load , reduce procedure time overall reduction cost ( less catheter use per procedure ) procedure complete use single diagnostic catheter . Potential limitation method include reduce opacification leave ventricle decrease number cardiac cycle available estimate EF . It currently unknown Hand LV accurate estimate EF compare standard Power LV . Objective : The primary objective study directly compare accuracy low volume Hand LV standard volume Power LV estimate EF . Methods : This study conduct outpatient setting . The subject enrol study adult refer radial coronary angiography leave ventriculography clinical indication . Subjects undergo Hand LV Power LV time angiography . EF Hand LV Power LV estimate subject blinded fashion 2 independent experienced cardiologist . Additionally , quantitative EF measurement make use integrated standard computer software Power LV Hand LV . Each patient serve control . Research Design : This prospective single center study design evaluate clinical technique diagnostic accuracy . Clinical Relationships : It anticipate Hand LV accurate method estimate EF compare Power LV . ( e.g . within 5 % difference clinically consider within inter intra-individual variability . ) This knowledge allow clinician confidently perform Hand LV time radial coronary angiography estimate EF , reduce procedure time , contrast load overall cost procedure .</detailed_description>
