	<brief_summary>A methyl-group acceptor guanidinoacetic acid ( GAA ) could induce hyperhomocysteinemia effect GAA expect dose-dependent . Due fact hyperhomocysteinemia think independent risk factor cardiovascular neurodegenerative disease , different dietary agent use past treatment elevate total plasma homocysteine ( T-HCy ) , e. g. betaine , choline ( betaine precursor ) folic acid . In context GAA load question arise whether intake betaine , choline ( betaine precursor ) folic acid GAA loading could affect plasma T-HCy healthy human . Forty healthy physically active men woman age 20 30 year take part GAA-controlled , double-blind parallel-group intervention study . Subjects allocate four randomly assign trial , treatment last 8 week washout period 28 day . The 4 test treatment-groups include TEST1 ( GAA ) , TEST2 ( GAA , choline , B6 , B12 folic acid ) , TEST3 ( GAA , betaine , B6 , B12 folic acid ) TEST4 ( GAA , B6 , B12 folic acid ) . Plasma T-HCy primary outcome measure assess every second week throughout study . Plasma B-vitamins blood urine metabolite ( GAA , creatine , methionine , arginine ) secondary outcome measure along adverse-effects indicator assess every second week throughout study . Selected body composition indicator obtain 0 , 2 , 8 12 week throughout study monitor effect experimental treatment body hydration protein synthesis . This research test hypothesis combination GAA homocysteine lower nutrient attenuate elevation T-hcy , display size-effect additive use .</brief_summary>
