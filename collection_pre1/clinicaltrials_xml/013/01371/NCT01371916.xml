	<brief_summary>Early reliable diagnosis tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) still pose great challenge . One underlying difficulty due fact tubercle bacillus mainly present cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) phagocytotic macrophage . The present study design demonstrate early secretory antigenic target 6 ( ESAT-6 ) , mycobacterium-specific antigen , macrophage infect CSF sample compare efficiency antigen laboratory diagnosis TBM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnosis Tuberculous Meningitis ESAT-6 CSF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis disease carry global health burden , tuberculous meningitis ( TBM ) one serious clinical manifestation extrapulmonary tuberculosis . The failure promptly recognize treat patient TBM enables disease exact devastate toll around globe despite availability effective chemotherapy . Therefore , accurate timely identification infect individual subsequent prompt initiation effective anti-tuberculosis chemotherapy essential reduce mortality TBM.1 However , disease often difficult diagnose certainty , especially early stages,2 present clinical cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) feature TBM non-specific differentiate plethora infectious meningitides viral , bacterial cryptococcal meningitis , frequently result diagnostic confusion . Consequently , TBM often diagnose irreversible neurologic damage already take place immediate anti-tuberculosis therapy therefore recommend regardless result individual test TBM seriously contemplate . The confirmation TBM depend demonstration Mycobacterium tuberculosis CSF bacteriological method . Smear acid-fast bacillus microscopy rapid inexpensive , low sensitivity ( 10-20 % ) ,3 culture also lack sensitivity time-consuming . A number strategy attempt improve laboratory diagnosis TBM . Nucleic acid amplification test ( NAAT ) show potential role confirm diagnosis TBM , , , suffer problem overall low sensitivity ( 0.46-0.66 ) , partly due low bacillary load CSF.4-5 Immunodiagnostic method also evaluate , heterogeneity immune response TBM patient different stage infection pose major obstacle detection mycobacterial antibody CSF samples.6-7 In general , patient chronic stage TBM myriad antibody responses major antigen Mycobacterium tuberculosis , patient early stage scarcely detectable antibody response . In addition , interpretation mycobacterial antibody CSF must take account contribution antibody plasma , therefore , jeopardize use antibody-based immunodiagnostic method location needed.7 One approach provide direct evidence exist infection detection presence specific antigens circulate CSF . The first generation test employ non-specific antigen exemplify bacille Calmette-Guerin ( BCG ) purify protein derivative ( PPD ) .8-10 Genomic analysis antigen mining Mycobacterium tuberculosis yield novel , specific antigen , early secretory antigenic target 6 ( ESAT-6 ) , 38-kD antigen , Ag85 complex.11 Nevertheless , diagnostic efficiency antigen-based approach still unsatisfactory.5-6 Mycobacterium tuberculosis belongs group intracellular bacteria , replicate within rest macrophage . During early stage central nervous system ( CNS ) infection , tubercle bacillus CSF immediately phagocytosed macrophages,12-13 leading scarcity mycobacterial marker circulate CSF . Thus , test yet become available early diagnosis active TBM requisite sensitivity specificity . The investigator hypothesize , contrast scarcity mycobacterial marker circulate CSF , macrophage infect CSF may carry high load mycobacterial antigen , could lend development cell-based diagnostic approach TBM . Here , investigator seek develop smear immunocytochemical method improve accuracy early diagnosis TBM examine early secretory antigenic target 6 ( ESAT-6 ) , mycobacterium-specific antigen , macrophage CSF specimens patient TBM patient infectious meningitis TBM . The investigator also compare efficiency cell-based approach detect mycobacterial antigen microbiological NAAT method laboratory diagnosis TBM . Further , basis clinical presentation , CSF etiological finding study , investigator propose novel diagnostic criterion TBM .</detailed_description>
