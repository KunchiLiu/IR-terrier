	<brief_summary>Accurate preoperative tumor detection stag fundamental treating patient pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Patients unresectable tumor benefit spared extensive operation associate substantial morbidity mortality , cost , pain . On hand , patient localize disease , amenable surgical removal , option operation . Therefore , accurate staging pancreatic cancer require detection tumor , evaluation size , relationship major peri-pancreatic vascular structure portal venous system , locoregional lymph node , distant metastasis . Multiple image technique use evaluate pancreas . Although , point , consensus exist best stag algorithm , multidetector ( MD ) compute tomogrophy ( CT ) Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) provide sufficient information management patient . Patients tumor large 3 cm characterize non-surgical . CT sensitivity detect small pancreatic tumor le 2 cm low . Multiple method suggest increase sensitivity CT . The sensitivity CT increase use multidetector CT accuracy rate 95-97 % initial detection approximate 100 % staging . Secretin ( natural hormone produce duodenal mucosal cell ) know increase blood flow pancreas . The principal use secretin image today exocrine function pancreas morphological evaluation pancreatic duct ultrasound MRI . Theoretically , pancreatic contrast enhancement also increase secretin administration . This would imply tumor conspicuity might also increase contrast enhancement normal pancreas increase . Secretin CT advocate center improve depiction ampulla periampullary/duodenal disease improve contrast enhancement . O'Connell et al , use secretin patient suspect know pancreatic mass conclude administration intravenous secretin lead great enhancement pancreas great tumor conspicuity , image without secretin . MRI pancreas undergone major change provide noninvasive image pancreatic duct parenchyma . MR cholangiopancreatography ( MRCP ) enable detection anatomic variant pancreas divisum . Although contrast material-enhanced CT still consider gold standard acute pancreatitis detection calcification chronic pancreatitis , MR image secretin-enhanced MRCP useful evaluate pseudocysts pancreatic disruption . The role MR still debate pancreatic neoplasm except cystic lesion MR image provide critical information regard lesion 's content possible communication pancreatic duct . Although article show MRI equivalent CT diagnosis staging , others show opposite . Nishiharu et al . find comparable tumor detection benefit CT , notably peripancreatic vascular invasion . Comparing CT , echoendoscopy , MRI , Soriano et al . demonstrate CT show high level precision primary tumor staging , local-regional staging , vascular invasion , distant metastasis , Tumor , node , metastasis ( TNM ) staging , tumor resectability . MRI retain originality image parenchyma , pancreatic biliary duct , vascular structure ; however , many institution , CT remain reference image choice diagnose stag pancreatic cancer . Other CT 's advantage tumor , excellent spatial resolution also provide detailed reconstruction plane arterial mapping therefore make possible search surgical contraindication celiac trunk stenosis . MRI still use today second-intention tool doubt CT echoendoscopy sufficiently conclusive ; currently recommend use MRI first-intention diagnosis pancreatic cancer . The aim pilot study determine whether administration intravenous secretin contrast-enhanced CT MRI improve pancreatic enhancement pancreatic tumor conspicuity evaluate technique appropriate pancreatic tumor detection , stag evaluation resectability .</brief_summary>
