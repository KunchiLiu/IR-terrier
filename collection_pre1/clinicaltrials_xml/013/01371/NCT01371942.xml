	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate mutational change occur colorectal tumor , benign polyp , malignant cancer metastatic tumor . The investigator also plan establish clinical correlation , emphasize aspect diagnosis prognosis disease specific treatment outcome . For purpose , investigator plan obtain specimens patient colorectal tumor extract DNA material . The specimen include tissue either primary ( mostly endoscopic biopsy specimen ) metastatic tumor ( obtain sonogram image modality guide biopsy ) , well humor include blood ( serum ) , malignant ascites , pleural effusion body fluid could relate CRCs . These patient would receive detailed explanation regard investigation sign IRB consent . At initial stage , Wanfang Medical Center would medical institution endoscopic specimen would collect . The project would eventually extend Taipei Medical University Hospital Shuan-Ho Hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The following item correspond critical task project . 1 . Collect , annotate , store fresh endoscopic specimens suspicious abnormal tissue ( premalignant lesion primary tumor genetic mutational investigation ; 2 . Collect , annotate , store fresh specimen metastatic lesion ( e.g . : hepatic metastatic tumor ) , sonographic image modality guide biopsy procedure ; 3 . Collect , process , store serum , plasma isolate lymphocyte blood drawn patient colorectal tumor ; 4 . Establish database link material acquisition , pathologic , clinical information patient participate protocol ; 5 . To utilize clinical database perform clinical pathological correlation result current future scientific study ; 6 . To evaluate genomic biochemical alteration colorectal tumor . 7 . To test effect small molecule inhibitor activation wild-type mutant genetic alteration and/or potential molecular target . 8 . To correlate tumor genotype signal abnormality clinical response genetic alteration and/or potential molecular target inhibitor 9 . Analysis laboratory finding relationship patient demographic clinical course .</detailed_description>
