	<brief_summary>The primary objective demonstrate plasma inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) assay ( PliNOSa® test ) acceptable relative risk ratio predict onset sepsis within 72 hour test perform first day patient admit transfer intensive care unit ( ICU ) consider risk become septic . The PliNOSa® test measure inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) plasma use pre-determined iNOS cut-off value identify patient risk onset sepsis pathology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>At present , accurate definitive clinical test predict early onset sepsis pathology exist . At least 7 million people per year enter early stage sepsis pathology , lead 250,000 death per year USA 750,000 worldwide . An early , accurate , reliable test ass intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient 's risk become septic would major medical breakthrough . A large unmet clinical laboratory need exist test aid physician assess patient 's risk onset sepsis pathology . The current culture procedure suffer number problem . ( 1 ) They slow . The first answer obtain 24 hour culture , absolute answer require minimum 48 hour culture . ( 2 ) Blood culture yield positive result ( i.e . sepsis present ) approximately 28 % patient become septic , thus 70 % patient yield positive blood culture . Everyone sepsis field agree well IVD test sepsis pathology desperately need . Our PliNOSa IVD test base upon presence iNOS plasma identify patient risk develop sepsis since assay dependent upon culture live bacteria micro-organism . Sepsis develop variety bacterial fungal source stem patient 's inability fight infection , commonly acquire recover severe injury surgery hospital . An early , accurate , reliable clinical diagnostics test onset sepsis currently exist , enormous clinical laboratory need exist . In January 2008 , Levenson review current status clinical diagnosis sepsis conclude [ 1 ] none currently FDA clear risk-assessment test work well [ 2 ] new biomarkers specific sepsis pathology would major medical breakthrough . In 2000 , Institute Medicine National Academy Science estimate cost US healthcare system $ 17 - 29 billion annually . The presence plasma normally intracellular protein , inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , find early accurate biomarker onset sepsis pathology . Data gather use vitro diagnostic ( IVD ) test analyze 1,200 blood sample collect clinical study 350 study subject ( 295 ICU patient 55 healthy volunteer ) demonstrate iNOS present plasma sample obtain people suffer onset sepsis . In three clinical study , latter two partially funded NIH , candidate IVD test plasma iNOS find predict onset sepsis 24 - 72 hour appearance physiological symptom pathology . The superiority plasma iNOS compare potential biochemical marker SIRS ( pre-sepsis ) sepsis assess use data third clinical study . Four cohort study analyze plasma level four potential biomarkers sepsis pathology : iNOS , procalcitonin ( PCT ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFα ) . The four cohort ( 1 ) 36 normal healthy individual Group A ; ( 2 ) critically injured patient remain SIRS septic negative throughout entire study period Group B ; ( 3 ) critically ill patient become septic study period , plasma level 24 hour symptoms sepsis recognize attend doctor Group C ; ( 4 ) confirm septic patient enrol study receive antibiotic prior enrollment Group D. Only plasma iNOS find differentiate non-septic critically ill patient ( Group B ) critically ill patient develop sepsis ( Group C ) already septic ( Group D ) . The plasma level procalcitonin , one FDA clear IVD test , specific sepsis since number normal healthy volunteer many non-SIRS non-septic patient elevate plasma level procalcitonin ( PCT ) . To summarize , infection intensive care unit hospital setting cause different type organism , bacteria fungi . These infection annually cause 7,000,000 case SIRS ( pre-sepsis ) deteriorate sepsis , severe sepsis organ dysfunction , septic shock multiple organ failure . To date , three clinical study conduct project 295 ICU patient 55 healthy volunteer enrol study . The data obtain prior clinical study clearly demonstrate measurable increase plasma level iNOS occur onset sepsis pathology . The main focus research proposal gather data need obtain FDA clearance market new PliNOSa® test demonstrate statistically significant number critically ill ICU patient presence iNOS plasma reliable early biomarker risk assessment aid onset sepsis .</detailed_description>
