	<brief_summary>After stroke excitability brain decrease stroke side increase opposite , non-stroke side . These change make use stroke-affected arm difficult slow recovery . Rehabilitation exercise increase arm use stroke help increase brain excitability , net effect approach low . New therapy need restore equal level brain excitability two side . Brain stimulation noninvasive way affect activity excitability brain cell . Pairing brain stimulation exercise require patient learn new movement may help brain learn . Using stimulation reduces activity side opposite stroke increase activity stroke -affected side , connection two brain hemisphere . The purpose study test brain stimulation side opposite stroke , pair arm movement exercise , help patient learn new arm movement improve arm function . In study people stroke receive brain stimulation two different area side brain opposite stroke : 1 ) area responsible movement 2 ) responsible sensation . These experiment test short long term effect brain stimulation patient ' learn arm function allow u identify area brain best improves learn arm function . These experiment potential improve effectiveness rehabilitation stroke . The propose study among first test stimulation side brain opposite stroke damage multiple site . This unique approach may help stimulate development new method stroke rehabilitation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective proposal examine efficacy new approach stroke recovery base recent report interhemispheric contribution neuroplastic change motor skill learn . After stroke , cortical excitability decrease ipsilesional increased contralesional primary motor cortex ( M1 ) . Combined , change hamper hemiparetic arm use impede functional recovery . Increasing hemiparetic arm use elevate excitability ipsilesional cortex improve function . Importantly , skilled motor practice raise cortical excitability even great extent merely increase generalize use . However , impact increase cortical excitability recovery function stroke limit , perhaps rate change associate increase use learn new motor skill low . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) noninvasive method brain stimulation . In human , rTMS apply high frequency increase cortical excitability ; conversely , low frequency decrease cortical excitability . While rTMS isolation change cortical excitability stroke impact neuroplastic change small , likely reflect lack consolidation absence pair motor behaviour . Modulating activity give neural network brain stimulation prior motor skill practice may essence prime system enhance neuroplastic effect associate learn new motor skill . Yet date , study pair rTMS practice novel motor task assess change motor function behaviour . Intuitively , seem simple employ high frequency rTMS ipsilesional cortex enhance cortical excitability . However , difficulty locate stimulation target damage hemisphere , low-frequency rTMS apply contralesional cortex may better approach . Though direct effect low-frequency rTMS human cortex suppress activity stimulate region also indirectly enhance distant activity . Low-frequency rTMS M1 increase cortical activity contralateral M1 homologue . We recently extend finding primary sensory cortex ( S1 ) ; demonstrate low-frequency rTMS leave S1 increase excitability ( i.e. , disinhibited ) right S1 . Therefore , suppress contralesional cortex enhance ipsilesional cortical activity may facilitate neural environment conducive neuroplastic change . Taken together data suggest inhibitory brain stimulation contralesional cortex , pair skilled motor practice , may offer new approach stroke rehabilitation . To good understand whether approach merit , propose test two specific aim separate experiment . Specific Aim : To test cumulative effect repeat session pair brain stimulation M1c versus S1c skilled motor practice individual stroke . We assess hemiparetic arm motor sensory function , motor performance/ motor skill acquisition ( repeat sequence response time ) , cortical excitability , neuroelectric activity individual chronic sub-cortical stroke . Pre-brain stimulation measure compare obtain 5 day train paired brain stimulation separate no-rTMS retention test ass cumulative effect brain stimulation .</detailed_description>
