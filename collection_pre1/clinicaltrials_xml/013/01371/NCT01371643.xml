	<brief_summary>This randomize , multicenter trial stratification do single radiologist coordinate center ( NYU ) , patient comparable disease randomize Sandostatin LAR treatment administer 1 time per month IM injection 3 month ( Arm A ) , non-cured patient , ( Arm B ) surgery . All patient undergo transsphenoidal hypophysectomy . The impact surgical debulking responsiveness Sandostatin LAR evaluated.The primary objective trial determine whether surgery ( debulking pituitary adenoma ) improve response patient acromegaly treatment Octreotide LAR , compare Octreotide LAR therapy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Surgical Debulking Pituitary Adenomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current goal treatment people acromegaly normalization growth hormone ( GH ) insulin-like-growth-factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) level . Normalization GH IGF-1 level attenuate morbidity ( hypertension , cardiovascular disease , sleep apnea , increase cancer risk , arthritis ) increase mortality associate persistent GH IGF-1 elevation . The optimal approach achieve goal patient pituitary macroadenomas remain controversial . Available treatment modality include transsphenoidal hypophysectomy , medical therapy ( somatostatin analogue and/or dopaminergic agonist ) , radiotherapy , combination intervention . No randomized trial conduct investigate whether surgical debulking pituitary macroadenomas enhances efficacy medical therapy . This study design rigorously investigate whether surgical debulking increase efficacy long-acting depot somatostatin preparation , Sandostatin LAR , evidence-based optimal care may offer patient acromegaly .</detailed_description>
