	<brief_summary>This double blind , randomise , placebo control , cross study 20 otherwise healthy male nicotine abstinent smoker test follow 3 acute treatment condition ( placebo , 4 8mg GSK1034702 ) . Each subject undergo screen assessment within 30 day prior administration first dose study medication . There 3 treatment session dose separate minimum 1 week washout period . There two test day ( day 1 day 2 ) per treatment session . On treatment session subject admit day 1 . On day 1 , subject administer placebo approximately 3 hour later , Baseline EEG/ERP recording , neuropsychological ( Cogstate battery ) test mood/craving/dependence questionnaire assessment . Subjects allow smoke approximately midnight day 1 . On day 2 , subject undergo pre-drug neuropsychological ( Cogstate battery ) test questionnaire assessment mood/craving . This conduct approximately 1 hour prior dose . Subjects randomize one six treatment sequence . Post dose EEG/ERP recording , neuropsychological ( Cogstate battery ) test mood/craving measurement conduct 3 6 hour post treatment coincide peak pharmacokinetic effect . This test perform approximately 12pm follow least 12hrs nicotine abstinence . Blood sample collect baseline ( pre-drug ) follow drug administration quantify exposure level .</brief_summary>
