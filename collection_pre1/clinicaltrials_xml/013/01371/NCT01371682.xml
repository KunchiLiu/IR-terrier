	<detailed_description>This open-label , randomised , two-period crossover , single dose study demonstrate bioequivalence extend release 2 mg ropinirole XL tablet manufacture two different site healthy subject . Dosing fast condition minimum one week washout dos . Domperidone administer control dopaminergic side effect . Pharmacokinetic sample take follow dose . Safety assessment include screen follow-up vital sign , ECGs safety laboratory test . Vital sign adverse event monitor periodically throughout study . The manufacturing ropinirole XL tablets move Crawley ( UK ) manufacturing facility Aranda ( Spain ) manufacturing facility . The tablet manufacture Aranda characteristic manufacture Crawley . The present pharmacokinetic study design assess bioequivalence ropinirole XL 2 mg tablet manufacture Aranda v ropinirole XL 2 mg tablet manufacture Crawley . Bioequivalence two tablet test healthy subject administer fast state .</detailed_description>
