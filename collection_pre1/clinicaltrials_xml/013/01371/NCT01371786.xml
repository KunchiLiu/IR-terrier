	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Scintigraphy Study Assess Nasal Deposition Ciclesonide . Using Novel Nasal Metered Dose Inhaler</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open label , single dose , single site , randomize , cross study ass nasal deposition radioactivity follow nasal inhalation ciclesonide radiolabeled solution via novel nasal MDI mometasone furoate monohydrate radiolabeled suspension via aqueous nasal spray approximately 10 14 patient symptomatic allergic rhinitis , age 18 65 year . In order ensure patient symptomatic time dosing , participant ask withhold usual treatment perennial seasonal allergic rhinitis , begin Screening Visit Study Visit 3 . Each patient randomly assign one two treatment sequence . The two treatment study single dose ( one 37 mcg actuation per nostril ) radiolabeled solution ciclesonide nasal aerosol 74 µg ( Regimen A ) single dose ( two 50 mcg actuation per nostril ) radiolabeled suspension mometasone aqueous nasal spray 200 µg ( Regimen B ) .</detailed_description>
