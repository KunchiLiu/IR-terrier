	<detailed_description>GSK2239633 human chemokine receptor 4 ( CCR4 ) antagonist novel anti-inflammatory profile act mainly subset Th2 cell , potential oral treatment severity asthma . Inhibition CCR4 receptor represent target asthma potential inhibit Th2 cell chemotaxis subsequent effect limit Th2 cell involvement acute chronic inflammatory response . Recent data man suggest CCR4 receptor ligand ( thymus activation-regulated chemokine ( TARC ) macrophage-derived chemokine ( MDC ) ) may important asthma development Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis ( ABPA ) . This provide unique opportunity differentiate GSK2239633 significantly oral non-steroidal asthma treatment . This study first administration oral GSK2239633 human . Two alternate cohort 12 subject receive 3 single , ascend dos oral GSK2239633 placebo . In addition , one cohort receive single dose GSK2239633 placebo follow standard FDA high fat/high calorie meal . Safety monitor ( ECGs , telemetry , vital sign , clinical laboratory assessment , adverse event ) , blood sample take pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic analysis .</detailed_description>
