	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To determine efficacy Sunitinib progression-free survival 12 month subject progressive malignant pheochromocytoma paraganglioma treat sunitinib start dose 37.5 mg daily ( continuous dose ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To determine overall survival progression free survival . - To determine time progression . - To determine objective response rate one year . - To determine time duration tumor response . - To assess safety profile include dedicate cardiovascular management ( home-blood pressure monitoring , ECG echocardiography ) . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES : -Identification predictor response well surrogate marker overall survival anticipate</detailed_description>
