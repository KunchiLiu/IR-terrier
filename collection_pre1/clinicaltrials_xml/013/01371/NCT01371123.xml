	<brief_title>Serum Aluminum Concentration Pediatric Patients Receiving Long-Term Parenteral Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aluminum contamination parenteral nutrition ( PN ) solution concern decade link metabolic bone disease ( MBD ) due 's high aluminum content . Currently United States , FDA regulation place protect American patient PN effect aluminum ( AL ) toxicity . Despite regulation , pediatric patient PN still receive high recommend AL intake PN . Unlike United States , regulation govern AL content intake PN solution Canada . Consequently , investigator unaware AL content various PN solution give patient . The investigator ( author ) observe significant number patient long-term PN ( Home PN ) , MBD . Some patient also bone fracture . The investigator also observe alteration calcium phosphate concentration well suppress PTH . In effort understand etiology MBD investigator measure serum AL concentration patient find high ; 900 - 2000 nmol/L compare 0 220 nmol/L report healthy adult . This lead u believe significant problem AL contamination PN solution Canada . Because investigator unable obtain information AL content various PN solution PN supplier , investigator decide report serum AL concentration patient well AL concentration random sample PN solution provide patient . Plasma aluminum concentration already analyze case . Blood drawn routine clinical monitoring subject PN six week . This first step towards raise awareness potential problem . It hope provide initial evidence help guide Health Canada 's decision regard regulation AL content PN solution Canada .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>For Cases Longterm PN : 1 . On PN â‰¥ 6 consecutive week 2 . Has serum AL concentration drawn record past For Control Subjects : 1 . Currently patient Hospital Sick Children follow inpatient ward ambulatory clinic 2 . Are PN never receive PN past 3 . Fed mouth enterally feed tube For Cases Longterm PN 1 . Patients PN shorter 6 week 2 . Patients never serum AL concentration measure 3 . Patients receive albumin infusion blood draw Al concentration 4 . Patients hemodialysis For Control Subjects 1 . Patients able matched case/subject longterm PN age gender 2 . Patients require blood work part routine clinical monitoring 3 . Patients PN 4 . Patients know renal impairment 5 . Patients receive albumin infusion blood draw Al concentration</criteria>
