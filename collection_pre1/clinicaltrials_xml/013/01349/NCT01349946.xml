	<detailed_description>Currently , approve therapy acute stroke patient medication call tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) . This medication give intravenous infusion dissolve blood clot , thereby restore blood flow brain . Early restoration blood flow prevent permanent damage brain typically occur stroke . As result , patient achieve early restoration blood flow less disability stroke patient blood flow restore . Unfortunately , small fraction stroke patient treat tPA benefit tPA . Nationwide 3 percent stroke patient receive therapy . The short treatment time-window one main reason patient eligible treatment . Previously , tPA recommend 0 - 3 hour time window stroke onset , recent study show efficacy 4 ½ hour . AHA guideline recommend treatment iv tPA 4 ½ hr . However , number stroke patient benefit treatment remain small despite expansion time-window 3 4 ½ hr . This result two main limitation tPA . First , majority stroke patient present beyond 4 ½ hour time-window therefore remain ineligible treatment . Second , stroke patient receive tPA always benefit treatment restore blood flow patient . Our research show depend location blood clot , blood flow restore 20 50 % stroke patient treat tPA . Patients persistent blood vessel occlusion improvement clinical condition receive tPA arrive hospital outside 4 1/2 hour time window routinely undergo mechanical clot removal open occlude blood vessel brain . Mechanical clot removal increase percentage stroke patient achieve recanalization , result may increase proportion patient good clinical outcome . However unclear stroke patient mechanical thrombectomy suitable . Although effective remove blood-clots , appear mechanical clot retrieval beneficial patient . Whereas patient benefit , others experience effect , yet others likely harm mechanical clot retrieval . In order avoid harm maximize benefit important know , prior initiation mechanical clot retrieval procedure , procedure likely result clinical improvement . The investigator hypothesize response mechanical clot retrieval predict base characteristic MRI scan obtain prior retrieval procedure . The investigator hope learn new MRI technique help identify patient likely benefit mechanical clot removal receive tPA .</detailed_description>

Planned standard MRI include perfusion image MR angiography circle Willis ( MRA ) prior IA therapy 5 . Intraarterial thrombectomy start within 90 minute completion MRI scan within 12 hour symptom onset . ( Start IA therapy define time insertion femoral artery sheath ; Time brain scan define time scan complete ) 6 . Able obtain informed consent ( informed consent obtain prior baseline MRI scan ) . 1 .
