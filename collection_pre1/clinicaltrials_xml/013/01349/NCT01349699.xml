	<brief_summary>Iron affect immunity . However , exact effect iron innate immune response know . Animal data suggest iron administration induce oxidative stress enhances innate immune response , whereas iron chelation opposite effect . The investigator test hypothesis administration iron sucrose 1.25 mg/kg augments innate immune response , iron chelation deferasirox 30 mg/kg attenuates innate immune response human experimental endotoxemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Systemic inflammation accompany profound change iron distribution , mainly influence hepcidin , lead sequestration iron macrophages reticuloendothelial system , ultimately anemia inflammation . This redistribution iron may represent effective defense mechanism variety pathogen , need iron replication growth . The fact iron withhold strategy highly conserve part innate immune response illustrate iron homeostasis immunity closely related . Concordantly , several study animal model reveal immune modulatory effect iron iron chelation : Iron sucrose show potentiate inflammatory response associate mortality , iron chelation appear attenuate inflammation improve outcome murine model inflammation sepsis . The immune modulatory effect iron supplement chelators mainly attribute ability potentiate reduce formation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . A subfraction non-transferrin bound catalytically active iron , labile plasma iron , think responsible free iron able easily donate accept electron , thereby fuel redox reaction . Oxidative stress associate propagation immune response , endothelial dysfunction , contribute organ damage occur systemic inflammation . In accordance , anti-oxidants exert anti-inflammatory effect . As , iron chelation suggest valuable adjuvant therapy infection two distinct reason : inhibition bacterial growth protection organs inflammation induce oxidative stress . Effects iron status immune response till mainly investigate vitro animal model , often use supra-therapeutic dosage iron donor iron chelators . Data effect iron load iron chelation systemic inflammation human lack . The objective present study investigate acute effect therapeutic dosage iron load iron chelation therapy iron homeostasis , oxidative stress , innate immune response , subclinical organ injury systemic inflammation induce experimental endotoxemia human vivo .</detailed_description>
