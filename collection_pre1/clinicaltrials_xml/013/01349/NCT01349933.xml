	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient alive progression-free 6 month along confirm response rate dual primary endpoint.. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate best response duration response patient treat MK2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) . II . To evaluate overall survival progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient treat MK2206 . III . To evaluate safety tolerability MK2206 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetics MK2206 Asian patient . II . To study pharmacodynamic effect MK2206 use biomarkers correlation cancer-related outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample collection baseline periodically study pharmacogenomic pharmacokinetic study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
