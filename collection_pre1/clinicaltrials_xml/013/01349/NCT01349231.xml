	<brief_summary>Roughly one-third patient obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) experience significant clinical benefit first-line intervention pharmacotherapy selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) . Furthermore , OCD patient typically experience full treatment benefit first-line intervention time-lag two three month . Inadequate symptom relief delay symptom relief first-line treatment source substantial morbidity decrease quality life OCD patient . Converging line evidence neuroimaging , genetic pharmacological study support importance glutamate abnormality pathogenesis OCD . The investigator conduct open , uncontrolled study ketamine treatment-refractory OCD . Ketamine potent antagonist N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor demonstrate rapid anti-depressant effect patient Major Depressive Disorder . The investigator additionally provide evidence rapid improvement comorbid OCD trichotillomania ketamine infusion depress woman . Failure symptom relief delay symptom relief first-line treatment source substantial morbidity decrease quality life OCD patient . Ketamine represent possibility provide rapid symptom relief OCD patient may provide mechanism future drug development treat OCD rapidly effectively .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Roughly one-third patient obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) fail experience significant clinical benefit first-line intervention pharmacotherapy selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) . Antipsychotic augmentation pharmacological strategy treatment-refractory OCD demonstrate efficacy multiple double-blind trial ( 2 ) . Antipsychotic augmentation benefit around 1 3 treatment-refractory OCD . Furthermore , OCD patient typically experience full treatment benefit first-line intervention time-lag two three month . Failure symptom relief delay symptom relief first-line treatment source substantial morbidity decrease quality life OCD patient . Converging line evidence neuroimaging , genetic pharmacological study support importance glutamate abnormality pathogenesis OCD . In Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy study elevate concentration glutamate relate compound demonstrated caudate nucleus orbitofrontal cortex OCD patient compare normal control . In genetic study , single nucleotide polymorphism within glutamate transporter gene SLC1A1 associate diagnosis OCD . Open-label , pharmacological treatment study suggest glutamate modulating agent riluzole , n-acetylcysteine memantine may effective treatment OCD . Ketamine potent antagonist N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor , major type glutamate receptor brain . In placebo-controlled study complete Yale single dose ketamine ( 0.5 mg/kg , intravenously ) rapid antidepressant effect depress patient . In subject ketamine infusion produce mild psychotomimetic symptom euphoria dissipate within 120 minute , antidepressant effect ketamine infusion emerge first 180 minute persist 72 hour . Fifty percent depress patient receive ketamine treatment responder Day 3 compare 12.5 % placebo infusion group . These result replicate recent double-blind study perform NIMH third unpublished study conduct member group Yale . Our goal conduct open-label study treatment-refractory OCD determine ketamine may effective acute anti-obsessional agent .</detailed_description>
