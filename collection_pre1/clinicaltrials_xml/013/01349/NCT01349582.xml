	<brief_summary>Flow diverters recent addition range endovascular device available treatment intracranial aneurysm . The FIAT trial aim compare flow diversion best standard treatment context randomise control trial . Best standard treatment may include follow left treat physician decide : 1 ) conservative management ; 2 ) coil without high porosity stenting ; 3 ) parent vessel occlusion without bypass ; 4 ) surgical clipping . If treatment alternative deem flow diversion compassionate use , randomisation carry , patient enter registry data record accord schedule randomise patient . The primary hypothesis flow diversion perform `` acceptable '' immediate complication rate , define less 15 % morbidity mortality , AND increase number patient experience successful therapy , define complete near complete occlusion aneurysm 75 90 % , relative best standard treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Intracranial aneurysm , particularly large/giant , fusiform recurrent aneurysm increasingly treat flow diverters ( FDs ) , recently introduce approve neurovascular device . While rare case may treat way , patient conventional , conservative , validated approach coiling , parent vessel occlusion , surgical clipping exists . Early series registry use FDs various type aneurysms report treatment-related morbidity mortality range 0 4 8 % respectively , often delay haemorrhage . Hence , although grow enthusiasm use powerful new tool , complication increasingly report . Rationale Hypothesis : There urgent need offer new tool afford FDs patient currently present difficult aneurysm , context offer protection over-optimistic perspective , fashion , learn curve market . Only randomize clinical trial offer protection well provide answer question treatment option lead well patient outcomes . The primary hypothesis flow diversion perform `` acceptable '' immediate complication rate , define less 15 % morbidity mortality ( modify Rankin Score &gt; 2 3 month ) , AND increase number patient experience successful therapy , define complete near complete occlusion aneurysm 75 90 % . Objectives : Compare flow diversion ( FD ) Best-Standard Treatment ( BST ) context RCT . BST may follow : 1 ) conservative management ; 2 ) coil without high porosity stenting ; 3 ) parent vessel occlusion without bypass ; 4 ) surgical clipping ; 5 ) enter registry FD , treatment alternative FD compassionate use . Methods : Following randomization FD BST , patient undergo assign intervention follow 12 month . Clinical status record discharge , 1-3 month , 3-12 month . Angiographic evaluation record 3-12 month . Adverse Events record immediately procedure 12-month follow-up period . Patients FD registry similarly follow 12 month . A total 344 patient recruit 20 center worldwide . The trial expect last 5 year . Analysis : Comparability FD BST group use descriptive statistic frequency table , independent ANOVAs Mantel-Haentzel chi-square test . Comparison primary outcome use z-test independent proportion 12 month . Safety data compare independent t-tests chi-square statistic . Logistic regression use find variable capable predict success group 12 month .</detailed_description>
