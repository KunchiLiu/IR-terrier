	<brief_summary>Main objective : To evaluate impact CREATIF ( anticoagulation clinic Ile de France ) monitoring management patient treat VKAs compare usual primary care . Study hypothesis : The investigator suppose patient well quality anticoagulation manage CREATIF usual General Physicians ( GP )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating CREATIF Anti-coagulation Clinic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) reference anticoagulant oral therapy concern common disease Atrial Fibrillation ( AF ) Venous ThromboEmbolism ( VTE ) . In France , approximately 600,000 patient treated oral anticoagulant . The treatment monitor adjust INR . Time outside area target INR directly correlate complication ( thrombotic hemorrhagic ) , time zone mean effectiveness treatment . In France , monitor patient GP , percentage time outside target area INR high European North American comparators . To reduce complication VKA , specialize structure monitor anticoagulation emerge recent year around world ( Netherlands , Italy , UK , Canada , USA ) . The evaluation country show percentage time therapeutic INR range around 70 % patient monitor anticoagulation clinic ( ACC ) , France time measure around 50 % survey usual medical care . On data obtain abroad : correlation improve monitoring INR monitoring ACC decrease factor 3-4 morbidity mortality associate use VKA thus allow significant reduction hospitalization cause adverse drug effect thus health care cost . In France several ACC , emerge since 1998 . Ile de France since 2004 , ACC Ile-de-France call CREATIF ( Centre Reference Education antithrombotic Ile de France ) . Since inception date , active list approximately 450 patient monitor long-term anticoagulant treatment . The question benefit structure arise , decide establish prospective randomize study evaluate benefit management oral anticoagulant treatment CREATIF respect usual medical care term time therapeutic INR range . This study usual care , witch aim assess two type management anticoagulant therapy , alter type anticoagulant therapy duration . The overall medical care patient care pathway also remain unchanged . The study Randomized GP investigator , open , prospective , concern primary medical care ( independent central randomization ) . Primary care investigator GPs manage patient treat VKAs . They recruit list GPs work CREATIF several physician network ( North Paris Health Network , ARES 92 , GP Department Paris VII university , GP Department Paris West ) . CREATIF , investigator usual physician work anti-coagulation clinic . The aim study compare management patient treat VKA CREATIF versus management primary care . Therefore , evaluation criterion time therapeutic INR range . During 6 month randomize 2 arm : GPs versus CREATIF ; During next 6 month follow reversal mode management determine existence prolong benefit one follow CREATIF return usual medical care . The investigator also collect retrospective 6 month INR.A retrospective study , prospective , open multicenter direct individual benefit . Prospective study conduct cross-over : anticoagulant therapy patient follow six month CREATIF GP vice VERSA.Primary analysis : comparing two type monitor parallel group randomization : Group A Phase 1 versus Group B Phase 1 . Primary endpoint : percentage time therapeutic INR range . The main requirement commitment inclusion GP : To fax email communicate CREATIF To transmit coordinated CREATIF . Allow TEC ARC access medical record establish retrospective record . Support CREATIF approach , letter sign send medical laboratory INR value retrospective study.Patients treat VKA : COUMADINE PREVISCAN</detailed_description>
