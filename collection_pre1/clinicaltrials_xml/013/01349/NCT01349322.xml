	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : It yet know whether high per daily radiation therapy equally effective standard per daily radiation therapy treat breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well accelerate course high per daily radiation therapy concomitant boost work compare standard per daily radiation therapy sequential boost treat patient early-stage breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Higher Per Daily Treatment-Dose Radiation Therapy Standard Per Daily Treatment Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer That Was Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether accelerated course hypofractionated whole-breast irradiation ( WBI ) include concomitant boost tumor bed 15 fraction follow lumpectomy prove non-inferior local control regimen standard WBI sequential boost follow lumpectomy early-stage breast cancer patient . Secondary - To determine whether breast-related symptom cosmesis accelerate WBI hypofractionated ( 3 week ) concomitant boost non-inferior standard WBI sequential boost . - To determine whether risk late cardiac toxicity patient left-sided breast cancer treat hypofractionation non-inferior conventional fractionate radiation therapy ( RT ) base upon analysis radiation dosimetry CT-based treatment planning NTCP calculation . - To determine whether CT-based conformal method intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) WBI feasible multi-institutional setting follow lumpectomy early-stage breast cancer patient whether dose-volume analysis establish assess treatment adequacy likelihood toxicity . - To determine cosmetic result breast-related symptom 3 year hypofractionated breast radiation concomitant boost inferior obtain 3 year WBI sequential boost . - To determine whether future correlative study identify individual gene expression biological host factor associate toxicity and/or local recurrence standard hypofractionated WBI . - If show non-inferior , determine accelerate course hypofractionated WBI include concomitant boost tumor bed 15 fraction follow lumpectomy prove superior local control regimen standard WBI sequential boost follow lumpectomy early-stage breast cancer patient . - To determine whether treatment cost hypofractionated WBI concomitant boost high WBI sequential boost . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord age ( &lt; 50 vs. ≥ 50 year ) , prior chemotherapy ( yes vs. ) , estrogen-receptor status ( + vs. - ) , histology grade ( 1-2 vs. 3 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Treatment begin within 9 week last surgery chemotherapy delivery . - Arm I : Patients undergo standard whole-breast radiotherapy ( WBI ) comprise intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) 5 day week 3-5 week follow sequential radiotherapy boost lumpectomy area 5 day week 1-1½ week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients undergo accelerate hypofractionated WBI comprise IMRT 3D-CRT concurrent boost lumpectomy area 5 day week 3 week . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients ' tissue sample may collect future research study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 1 month , 6 month , yearly .</detailed_description>
