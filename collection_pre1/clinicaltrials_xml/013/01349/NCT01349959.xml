	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give azacitidine entinostat work treat patient advance breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Entinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving azacitidine together entinostat may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Entinostat Treating Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion combination azacitidine ( 5-AZA ) entinostat woman advance breast cancer ; triple-negative hormone-refractory . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability combination 5-AZA entinostat woman advance breast cancer . II . To determine progression-free survival , overall survival , clinical benefit rate combination 5-AZA entinostat . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect safety toxicity data well feasibility response rate hormonal therapy add combination investigation time progressive disease . ( Exploratory ) II . To determine pharmacokinetic profile 5-AZA ( full profile ) entinostat ( trough concentration ) patient advance breast cancer . ( Exploratory ) III . To assess serum cytidine deaminase pharmacogenetics phenotypic activity potential biomarker response 5-AZA . ( Exploratory ) IV . To evaluate baseline change candidate gene re-expression ( e.g. , estrogen receptor [ ER ] alpha , retinoic acid receptor [ RAR ] beta ) malignant tissue obtain select patient fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) core biopsy , prior follow combination therapy . ( Exploratory ) V. To evaluate baseline change gene methylation silence circulate deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) obtain prior follow combination therapy . ( Exploratory ) VI . To evaluate baseline change gene methylation malignant tissue obtain FNA core biopsy . ( Exploratory ) OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-5 8-10 , entinostat orally ( PO ) day 3 10 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progressive disease may continue azacitidine entinostat combination hormonal therapy , treat physician discretion , undergo event monitoring . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
