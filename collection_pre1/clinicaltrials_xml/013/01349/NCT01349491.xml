	<brief_title>Ranolazine Prevention Atrial Fibrillation After Electrical Cardioversion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia associate increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Although rhythm control strategy offer survival benefit rate control strategy , elective electrical cardioversion still recommend patient without hemodynamic instability symptomatic relief . However , recurrence frequent cardioversion antiarrhythmic medication require maintain sinus rhythm . Nonetheless , use antiarrhythmic medication problematic risk serious potential adverse effect , include drug-induced ventricular arrhythmia . Ranolazine novel antianginal agent , inhibits late inward sodium current produce antiischemic effect without reduce heart rate blood pressure . Additionally , recent preclinical well preliminary clinical data suggest ranolazine exhibit distinct antiarrhythmic property . However , control data use ranolazine prevent recurrence AF electrical cardioversion persistent AF . The investigator hypothesize ranolazine would decrease incidence recurrence AF electrical cardioversion persistent AF . Patients persistent AF candidate electrical cardioversion randomize either placebo ranolazine successful electrical cardioversion . They follow 2 week , 1 , 3 6 month clinical evaluation electrocardiography detection recurrence AF .</detailed_description>
