	<brief_title>EXPAREL Dose-Response Single-Injection Femoral Nerve Blocks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Putting local anesthetic next nerve common way decrease pain patient feel surgery . For knee surgery , local anesthetic place next femoral nerve middle crease leg meet body bend hip joint . However , local anesthetic take away sensation—and therefore pain—but also motor control , leave muscle weak . It would greatly improve patient safety investigator could administer long-acting local anesthetic decrease postoperative pain , affect muscle strength minimally . Currently , investigator know possible EXPAREL , investigator therefore conduct study help determine dose EXPAREL result minimal ( 20 % ) decrease muscle strength .</detailed_description>
