	<criteria>The patient must least 18 year age . Patients symptomatic coronary artery disease objective evidence ischemia ( e.g . symptom angina pectoris , positive stress test result , dynamic ECG change ) . Patients refer PCI , think high likelihood require stent placement without conventional balloon angioplasty The patient guardian agree study protocol schedule clinical angiographic followup , provide informed , write consent , approve appropriate Institutional Review Board/Ethical Committee respective clinical site . The patient know hypersensitivity contraindication follow medication : Heparin Aspirin Both Clopidogrel Ticlopidine Stainless steel and/or Contrast medium ( patient document sensitivity contrast effectively premedicated steroid diphenylhydramine [ e.g . rash ] may enrol . Patients true anaphylaxis prior contrast medium , however , enrol ) . Coronary anatomy amenable stent placement Female childbearing potential , unless recent pregnancy test negative , possibly plan become pregnant time enrollment study . History bleeding diathesis know coagulopathy ( include heparininduced thrombocytopenia ) , refuse blood transfusion . Gastrointestinal genitourinary bleeding within prior 3 month , major surgery within 2 month . Current known current platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 Hgb &lt; 10 g/dL . An elective major surgical procedure plan would necessitate interruption thienopyridines first 1 year post enrollment . Noncardiac comorbid condition present life expectancy &lt; 1 year may result protocol noncompliance ( per site investigator 's medical judgment ) . Patients actively participate another drug device investigational study , complete primary endpoint followup period . Administration follow medication prior randomization : GpIIbIIIa inhibitor clopidogrel within 7 day ( already receive pretreatment ) , thrombolytic within 24 hour . Longterm ( least &gt; 3 month ) use requirement NSAID anticoagulation Patients cardiogenic shock Acute MI patient within symptom onset &lt; 12 hour need primary angioplasty Patients leave main stem stenosis ( &gt; 50 % visual estimate )</criteria>
