	<brief_title>The Effect Prophylactic Swallowing Exercises Head Neck Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Type : Prospective Randomized Clinical Trial Introduction : Organ spar treatment advanced head neck cancer affect swallow mechanism via fibrosis structure responsible effective efficient bolus movement oral cavity pharynx esophagus . This fibrosis may result significant impairment bolus transport . Range motion exercise swallow structure may decrease fibrotic effect radiation treatment improve swallow outcomes treatment . Intervention : Patients diagnose head neck cancer receive radiation therapy either without chemotherapy cancer treatment randomize one two swallow treatment protocol . The first protocol include initiation intensive swallowing exercise begin start cancer treatment . The second treatment protocol include standard care provide swallow evaluation treatment symptom swallow dysfunction experience patient . Patients give choice swallow protocol . Those patient randomize intensive therapy protocol require participate weekly swallow therapy session either person phone perform learn swallow exercise three time day . In addition , patient document swallow practice daily basis . The investigator provide swallow treatment assure patient get treatment approach . All patient fill questionnaire swallowing ability call Performance Status Scale Head Neck Cancer Patients ( PSS-H &amp; N ) . This quick , clinician rat instrument consist three subscales : normalcy diet , public eat intelligibility speech . This scale proven reliable across raters sensitive functional difference across broad spectrum head neck cancer patient . This questionnaire complete start cancer treatment , completion treatment 3 , 6 , 12 24 month treatment . In addition , nature patient 's oral intake document investigator use Functional Oral Intake Scale ( FOIS ) seven point scale diet tolerance . This performed interval PSS-H &amp; N . Presence absence PEG feeding also document time . These scale use compare swallow outcomes patient two different treatment protocol .</detailed_description>
