	<brief_summary>In phase I/II study , investigator evaluate feasibility efficacy combination BKM120 , oral inhibitor PI3 kinase , bevacizumab treatment patient relapsed/refractory GBM . In Phase I part trial , optimal BKM120 dose administer standard dose bevacizumab determine patient refractory solid tumor . Although unlikely concurrent administration bevacizumab alter pharmacokinetics BKM120 , limit pharmacokinetic sampling perform patient treated Phase II portion study . Assuming combination feasible , Phase II portion study proceed , use dos determine Phase I portion . In phase II portion , eligible patient limited recurrent/progressive GBM follow 1st line combine modality therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination BKM120 Bevacizumab Refractory Solid Tumors Relapsed/Refractory Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized Phase I study patient advanced refractory solid tumor follow Phase II study second-line treatment patient relapsed/refractory glioblastoma multiforme . In phase I part study MTD BKM120 combine bevacizumab determine 60 mg/day . In Phase II part study , patient relapsed/refractory GBM follow first line therapy treat BKM120/bevacizumab combination . Limited BKM120 pharmacokinetic evaluation perform patient treated part study . Patients reevaluated response treatment 2 cycle ( 8 week ) . Patients objective response stable disease continue treatment , subsequent reevaluation every 8 week , disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur . Two population patient relapsed/refractory GBM treat Phase II trial : 1 ) patient previous exposure bevacizumab ( N= 55 ) 2 ) patient receive bevacizumab part first-line combined modality treatment ( N= 20 ) .</detailed_description>

No previous treatment PI3K inhibitor . Previous treatment bevacizumab component firstline therapy allow . At least one measurable evaluable lesion definable MRI scan . Disease must measurable RANO criterion . Archival tumor tissue available correlative testing . ALL PATIENTS : Patient must ≥ 4 week administration last dose cancer therapy ( include radiation therapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy ) . Patients receive small molecule target therapy part first line treatment regimen must ≥ 4 week ≥ 5 half live administration last dose , whichever shorter . The patient must recover come new chronic stable baseline treatmentrelated toxicity . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Life expectancy ≥ 3 month . Adequate hematologic , hepatic , renal function . Patients diarrhea ≥ grade 2 . Patients uncontrolled type I type II diabetes mellitus , define fast plasma glucose ≥120 mg/dL . Patients receive prior treatment P13K inhibitor . Treatment therapeutic dos coumarintype anticoagulant ( maximum daily dose 1 mg allow port line patency permit ) .
