	<brief_summary>The goal research program understand natural history asymptomatic bacteriuria renal transplant patient , determine screen asymptomatic bacteriuria identification key host characteristic virulence factor present uropathogenic bacteria identifies sub-population patient asymptomatic bacteriuria risk develop symptomatic urinary tract infection . Ultimately , knowledge obtain study prevent inappropriate antibiotic use may identify whether certain bacterial isolates predispose renal allograft injury . We test hypothesis ( ) asymptomatic bacteriuria common renal allograft recipient ( ii ) symptomatic urinary tract infection renal allograft dysfunction occur unless key host susceptibility factor uropathogenic bacterial virulence factor present .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood sample urine culture obtain asymptomatic renal transplant clinic patient . If urine culture positive ( &gt; = 105 cfu/ml ) , determine host bacterial virulence factor associate asymptomatic bacteriuria ( ASB ) compare result transplant patient develop symptomatic UTI . The patient 's clinical information , laboratory data bacterial isolate responsible UTI collect time clinic visit subsequently analyze . After first visit ( Day 0 sign consent ) blood urine collect , subject put either ASB Positive ASB Negative group base upon result urine culture . From point , test ASB Negative group additional urine culture , either return clinic send urine culture mailer kit , culture remain negative , discharge study review medication , adverse event complete urinary tract infection risk questionnaire . For test ASB Positive group , subject monitor subject return clinic Day 10-14 , 1 month , 2 month , 3 month 6 month blood urine collection , review medication adverse event , complete urinary tract infection risk questionnaire . Should subject symptom UTI , subject treat appropriate antibiotic bacterial isolate urine culture sensitive . Patients return clinic 10-14 day later repeat urine culture , complete urinary tract infection risk questionnaire , repeat urine culture confirm urinary tract infection free . At point , subject discharge study review medication adverse event . It predict 75 % patient test ASB Negative Group require antibiotic therapy . We predict 25 % patient test ASB Positive Group , less 5 % patient ultimately develop symptomatic UTI require antibiotic treatment .</detailed_description>
