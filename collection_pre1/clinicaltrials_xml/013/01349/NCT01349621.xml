	<brief_summary>This prospective study compare unpolarized ( conventional ) polarize light colposcopy . Subjects ask participate study arrive prescheduled colposcopic examination . The study doctor use conventional standard colposcope perform examination . His/her impression exam note necessary biopsy specimen obtain . The study doctor perform colposcopy use polarized light . His/her impression exam note biopsy specimen obtain necessary . This study design test hypothesis polarize light colposcopy sensitive specific standard , un-polarized light colposcopy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Women schedule colposcopic examination GRU CerviCusco ask participate study . Interested patient read sign IRB-approved Informed Consent Document ( ICD ) describe study potential involvement . The study coordinator read translate ICD woman speak language English Spanish ( i.e . Quechua ) . Pertinent disease specific demographic information collect patient . Following insertion vaginal speculum one minute application 5 % acetic acid , polarize non-polarized high resolution digital RGB image take ectocervix . Thereafter , non-polarized light colposcopy perform standard care . The colposcopist derive colposcopic impression indicate whether biopsy necessary . So compromise next examination , Lugol 's Iodine apply . Then , polarize light colposcopy perform . As , colposcopist derive impression , indicate whether biopsy necessary annotate site pending biopsy . Then indicate , minimum one cervical biopsy obtain area ( ) represent severe colopscopic change see non-polarized exam . The exact biopsy site annotate .</detailed_description>
