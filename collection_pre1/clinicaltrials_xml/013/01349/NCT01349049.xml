	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety study drug PLX3397 3 dose level ( 800 mg/day , 1000 mg/day , 1200 mg/day ) explore efficacy patient relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Additional dose level beyond 1200 mg/day may consider base safety efficacy observation .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient ≥18 year old . Morphologically documented primary AML , priorchemotherapyrelated AML AML secondary antecedent hematologic disorder ( e.g. , Myelodysplastic Syndrome ) define WHO criterion , confirm pathology review . For Cohort Expansion Phase ( Part 2 ) : Bone marrow involvement require . Have either relapse refractory AML , newly diagnose Flt3ITD positive AML either refuse consider Investigator appropriate candidate standard chemotherapy . 1 . Relapsed disease define reappearance leukemia cell bone marrow peripheral blood elsewhere body ( tissues/organs ) attainment CR . 2 . Refractory disease define failure obtain complete remission ( CR ) HDACcontaining standard induction regimen . Patients require two cycle induction therapy attain first CR consider refractory disease . Positive Flt3ITD activate mutation Screening . Local laboratory result must receive prior enrollment . Patients history Flt3ITD positive disease may consider discussion Medical Monitor . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Adequate recovery ( least Grade 1 ) toxicity prior therapy follow : 1 . ≥2 week cytotoxic therapy ( except hydroxyurea , permit dos ≤5g/day first 2 week Cycle 1 ) prior C1D1 . 2 . ≥4 halflives noncytotoxic therapy prior C1D1 . Patients must washout period last chemotherapy either ≥2 week OR least 4 halflives prior C1D1 . For patient whose recent antitumor treatment regimen consist multiagent cocktail , patient must washout period least 4 halflives agent long halflife . Adequate hepatic renal function 1 . Adequate renal function , define Creatinine Clearance &gt; 60 mL/min serum creatinine ≤ 1.3 mg/dL ( 115 μM ) . 2 . Adequate hepatic function , define AST ALT ≤3.0X ULN serum direct bilirubin ≤1.5X ULN . Exceptions may make patient elevated liver transaminase secondary AML discussion Medical Monitor Life expectancy least 1 month Willing able provide write informed consent prior study related procedure comply study requirement 3 month last dose . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day initiation dosing must agree use two acceptable method birth control study drug 3 month last dose . Women nonchildbearing potential may include meet least one follow criterion : 1 . Surgically sterile 2 . Have postmenopausal ≥1 year 3 . Have FSH level indicative postmenopausal state ( i.e. , 30120 IU/L ) document within 21 day C1D1 . Sexually active men must also agree use acceptable method birth control study drug least 3 month last dose Diagnosis acute promyelocytic leukemia Diagnosis chronic myelogenous leukemia blast crisis Presence CNS involvement leukemia . Patients history CNS involvement may consider discussion Medical Monitor Patients eligible HSCT time screen . However , patient meet one follow criterion may eligible study participation : 1 . Patients eligible HSCT nonoptimal AML disease control ( i.e. , blast &gt; 5 % ) may enrol study bridgetotransplant . 2 . Patients relapsed disease follow prior HSCT may enrol study alternative second HSCT bridgetotransplant regimen . For Parts 1 2 , receipt HSCT within 60 day first dose PLX3397 exclusion criterion . Patients immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT , clinically significant graftversushost disease exclude Part 1 . ( Use topical steroid ongoing skin GVHD permit ) . Patients Part 1 must washout period ≥2 week least 4 halflives last systemic immunosuppressive treatment GVHD . Patients Part 2 may receive systemic immunosuppressive treatment management GVHD time screen enrollment Investigational drug use within 28 day first dose PLX3397 For Cohort Expansion Phase ( Part 2 ) : Patients positive D835 mutation Screening exclude . A concurrent active cancer require nonsurgical therapy ( e.g. , chemotherapy , radiation , adjuvant therapy ) . Prior history cancer allow , long active disease within 1 year first dose PLX3397 . Refractory nausea vomiting , malabsorption , biliary shunt significant bowel resection , GVHD affect gut , condition would preclude adequate absorption Patients serious illness , uncontrolled infection , medical condition , medical history include abnormal laboratory result , investigator 's opinion would likely interfere patient 's participation study , interpretation result Women childbearing potential pregnant breast feeding At Screening , QTcF &gt; 450 msec male ; QTcF &gt; 470 msec female Patients history D835 mutation</criteria>
