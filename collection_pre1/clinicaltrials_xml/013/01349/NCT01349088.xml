	<brief_summary>In 2008 40,000 death cause metastatic breast cancer United States . The development new treatment strategy essential improve outcome patient metastatic breast cancer There significant preclinical clinical evidence indicate create new blood vessel ( neoangiogenesis ) provide nutrient solid tumor , include breast cancer , provide necessary condition allow tumor growth . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) one important molecule regulate new blood vessel formation subsequent invasion metastasis . As result , agent inhibit VEGF substantial interest treatment advance disease . This study body research motesanib show preclinical pharmacology clinical pharmacology study potent , orally bioavailable multi-kinase inhibitor anti-angiogenic anti-tumor activity achieve selectively target know VEGF , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) , Kit receptor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigational Drug Combination With Two Chemotherapy Drugs Women With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endocrine therapy chemotherapy ( use either sequential single agent combination regimen ) remain principal treatment woman metastatic breast cancer . A wide variety class chemotherapeutic agent demonstrate anti-tumor activity single agent combination regimen . Cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent mainstay cancer therapy many year improve survival many disease setting . Median survival remain approximately two year woman metastatic breast cancer , le 3 % patient experience long-term survival initiation treatment . The development new treatment strategy therefore essential improve outcome patient metastatic breast cancer . One promising pathway development new anti-neoplastic agent target tumor vascular endothelium . There significant preclinical clinical evidence indicate tumor neoangiogenesis critical pathogenesis progression solid tumor , include breast cancer . Of numerous known growth factor implicate tumor angiogenesis , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) one important molecule regulate new blood vessel formation subsequent invasion metastasis . As result , agent inhibit VEGF substantial interest treatment advance disease . More thorough elucidation mechanism behind intrinsic acquire resistance therefore imperative disease identify patient likely benefit treatment option . Motesanib show preclinical pharmacology PK study potent , orally bioavailable multi-kinase inhibitor anti-angiogenic anti-tumor activity achieve selectively target know VEGF , PDGF Kit receptor . It acceptable safety profile non-clinical clinical study , PK profile appear suitable daily oral dosing human . The investigational product motesanib ( Amgen ) small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor high efficacy VEGFR c-Kit kinase . C-kit detect 12 % breast cancer , correlate basal triple-negative breast cancer . In addition , efficacy drug note PDGFRα , express approximately 40 % breast cancer associate aggressive disease , metastatic invasion poor prognosis . Importantly , half ( 56 % ) case , carcinoma cell bear receptor express PDGF-A ligand , suggest autocrine loop cancer cell-autonomous process . Cancer cell-autonomous pathway especially attractive drug target metastatic breast cancer expect continue functional metastatic site , since depend stromal factor . The primary molecular target motesanib , VEGFR , intrigue neovascularization expect require also metastatic site . A preliminary analysis reveal VEGF expression correlate triple-negative , basal breast cancer subtype poor outcome . Importantly , PDGF receptor also present vascular pericytes , cell require adequate vascularization . Thus , motesanib unique multikinase inhibitor target growth factor receptor carcinoma cell growth factor receptor related neovascularization .</detailed_description>
