	<detailed_description>This research study individual investigator initiate meritorious project confirm efficacy `` Kallunk Oxide ( Immunotherapy ) '' treatment HIV- infection.The Previous clinical study show T- Lymphocytes responses `` Kallunk Oxide ( Immunotherapy ) '' effective treatment HIV- infection . This randomize intervention study confirm efficacy booster dose Kallunk Oxide molecules 5 mg participant , especially , great 8 year old child ( Adolescence Adults ) , men woman . The Principal Investigator select informed consented patient recruit trial . This study adhere `` Helsinki Declaration '' . The patient 's assay Lymphocyte enumeration primary end point . Immune output drug 's progressive immunity HIV cure follow- . The study investigate T- Lymphocytes ( immune ) response HIV . The impact CD3+ , CD4+ , CD8 T cell CD45+ response `` Kallunk Oxide ( Immunotherapy ) '' study . Patient 's body weight , CD4+ T cell hematological status investigate treatment period . The research team also mindful symptom nausea , fatigue weight loss , sweat , shortness breath , joint pain , etc . individually noted . During treatment period , case , patient temperature , digestion complaint chill , etc . may vary . Only circumstance , patient advise use control diet protocol use mutton soup , cow milk cow ghee . Privacy Confidentiality : The study must handle transparent privacy environment recruit HIV-infected people India data confidentially protect genuine write informed consent . Dosage : 5 mg `` Kallunk Oxide ( Immunotherapy ) '' molecule antidote 1995 mg `` Long Pepper '' ( Botanical name- Piper longum ) &gt; 8 &lt; 45 year old child adults genders.The study also evaluate effectiveness booster dose Kallunk Oxide ( 5 mg ) `` Long Pepper '' ( 1995 mg ) ART drug ( one tablet contain Zidovudine , lamivudine , nevirapine ) use adult ( &lt; 45 ) adolescence ( ages12 18 year female 14 18 year old male ) access serum negative status HIV CD+ T cell number &lt; 350 cu/mm^3 ART use HIV-patients.. Favorable result integrative intervention approach point use `` Kallunk Oxide ( Immunotherapy ) ' ART need nearly six hour time frame . More meaningfully , state HIV/AIDS patient may use ART evening time avoid possible side effect joint pain fatigue ( seldom case ) . The booster dose regimen therapy administer daily dose 10 day adherence six month ART drug ( Not Kallunk Oxide Therapy ) tolerance . If virus suppress completely , drug resistance develop . So , study serum negative status HIV baseline 24 week followed-up . Dosage : powder form sample size product 2 gm ( Kallunk Oxide + Antidote ) child adult daily dose recommend 7 day daily regimen monthly use mention baseline six ( 6 ) month time frame . Controlled Nourished diet : Patients control nourished diet protocol . Eat wheat product , rice food product , cow milk ( Â½ cup ) , cow ghee , green gram , banana , mutton soup , sweet fruit apple ( sweet ) , orange prepared black pepper add vegetable food .

Drug Administration : In study , patient use capsule/powder form medicine 1/2 cup hotter water . HIV- patient use one drug `` Kallunk oxide ( Immunotherapy ) '' calcined/or oxidize molecule . Precaution : No precaution need . The patient avoid sediment bottom cup .</detailed_description>
