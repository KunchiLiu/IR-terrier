	<brief_title>A Research Study Bone Marrow Transplantation From Unrelated Partially Matched Related Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary rationale development research study find use cyclophosphamide `` blood '' stem cell transplant effective treatment patient blood cancer require transplant long-term survival without available matched-sibling donor . Historically , survival rate patient undergo partially match relate unrelated donor transplant ( henceforth call alternative donor transplant ) much low observe match sibling stem cell transplant . Survival post alternative donor stem cell transplant also affect requirement remove reduce number donor T cell result high rate infection , graft rejection , relapse . One significant limitation conventional donor transplant HLA match sibling 50 % patient HLA match sibling increase safety alternative donor transplant could significant influence number patient could safely receive transplant . Because historically low overall survival ( OS ) alternative donor transplant , become procedure `` last resort '' many center unwilling consider unless option exhaust . There fore several center include seek overcome problem use various strategy . The strategy investigator propose study ( use similarly center ) administer cyclophosphamide post stem cell infusion ( traditionally give stem cell infusion ) thereby hopefully destroy activate T-cells cause graft-versus host disease ( GVHD ) allow T cell tolerization engraftment ; , inactivate T cell thereby hopefully preserve anti-tumor effect donor immune system . Thus , major aim study measure engraftment regimen secondarily measure incidence GVHD day 100 mortality . The goal see first 3 month use cyclophosphamide post stem cell infusion alternative donor safe effective traditional match transplant .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Any patient hematological oncological diagnosis allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) think beneficial . 1 . Patients without morphological molecular evidence disease 2 . For patient `` indolent disease , '' patient evidence disease disease burden must minimal ( least PR ) disease must chemoresponsive . Thus example patient acute leukemia ( indolent disease ) must morphological CR CRp . 2 . For patient MDS inclusion criterion specifically follow : For patient RA RARS isolate 5q proceed transplant without treatment . For patient RAEB1 , RCMD+/RS , MDS NOS must stable disease 6 month ( document serial bone marrow examination ) absence therapy growth factor transfusion support . Patients require treatment `` control disease '' must show chemoresponsiveness For patient CMML RAEB2 must demonstrate chemoresponsiveness Chemoresponsiveness define blast percentage decrease least 5 percentage point must less 10 % blast treatment time transplant , 10 % blast point disease course Chemoresponsiveness must also include least one follow applicable : A cytogenetic response A welldocumented decrease transfusion requirement . 3 . Patients must relate donor zero , one , two , three , four antigen mismatch HLAA ; B ; C ; DR locus unrelated donor two antigen mismatch . DNA retain tissue type laboratory possible type DQ DP . When multiple relate donor option available donor selection determine TJU twostep protocol . When multiple unrelated donor available care make avoid HLAA HLAB mismatch possible base data Japanese Marrow Donor Registry study . An HLA antibody screen perform patient . 4 . All patient must adequate organ function : 1 . Patients related donor must LVEF &gt; 35 % . Patients unrelated donor must LVEF &gt; 45 % . Patients LVEF ≤50 % patient symptoms history heart failure coronary artery disease must stress echo equivalent test cardiological evaluation . 2 . Patients related donor must DLCO &gt; 35 % predict correct hemoglobin . Patients unrelated donor must DLCO &gt; 45 % predict correct hemoglobin . For related donor DLCO le 45 % EF must great 45 % vice versa . 3 . Patients related donor must adequate liver function define serum bilirubin &lt; 3.0 , AST ALT &lt; 3.0X upper limit normal . Patients unrelated donor must adequate liver function define serum bilirubin &lt; 1.8 , AST ALT &lt; 2.5X upper limit normal . Exceptions may grant patient `` benign '' liver disorder Gilbert 's disease . 4 . Patients related donor unrelated donor must creatinine clearance &gt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 . 5 . Patients related donor must performance status &gt; 60 % ( TJU Karnofsky14 ) ( Appendix A ) . Patients unrelated donor must Performance status &gt; 70 % ( TJU Karnofsky ) . 6 . Patients related donor must HCTCI Score &lt; 6 Points ( Appendix B ) . Patients unrelated donor must HCTCI Score &lt; 5 Points . 7 . Patients must willing use contraception childbearing potential . 8 . Patients must able give informed consent care giver give consent . 9 . Patients HIV positive eligible study undetectable viral load meet criterion patient unrelated donor . 1 . Patients related donor combination Performance status &lt; 70 % ( TJU Karnofsky ) HCTCI 4 point . Patients unrelated donor combination Performance status &lt; 80 % ( TJU Karnofsky ) HCTCI 4 point . 2 . Patients active involvement central nervous system malignancy . Patients disease potential CNS involvement documentation lack CNS involvement via lumbar puncture similar procedure perform within two month admission per TJU standard practice guideline . 3 . Patients psychiatric disorder would preclude patient comply protocol even caregiver . Patients lack social support would interfere ability receive appropriate medical care also exclude . 4 . Pregnancy 5 . Patients life expectancy &lt; 6 month reason underlie hematological/oncological disorder . 6 . Patients receive alemtuzumab within 8 week transplant admission , recently receive horse rabbit antthymocyte globulin ATG level &gt; 2 μg/ml . Patients systemic corticosteroid dose equivalent prednisone 7.5mg/day high . 7 . Patients receive cyclophosphamide . 8 . Patients evidence another malignancy , exclusive skin cancer require local treatment , enrol protocol . 9 . Patients refractory disease . 10 . Patients preformed antibody donor . 11 . Patients require supplemental oxygen sleep apnea exclude .</criteria>
