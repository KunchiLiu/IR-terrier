	<brief_summary>TheraSphere medical device contain yttrium-90 ( Y-90 ) radioactive material use treat liver tumor . When Y-90 put tiny glass bead ( TheraSphere ) , inject liver blood vessel . This allow large local dose radiation deliver tumor less risk toxic effect radiation part body healthy liver tissue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TheraSphere Treatment Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical resection affect portion liver offer best chance disease-free survival patient hepatoma ( HCC ) . Unfortunately , hepatoma patient present disease amenable resection ( multifocal disease ) medical contraindication surgery ( limited hepatic reserve relate advanced cirrhosis chronic hepatitis ) . Fewer 15 % 1 hepatoma patient suitable surgical candidate . The objective treatment TheraSphere selectively administer potentially lethal dose radioactive material neoplastic tissue liver patient HCC . Regional therapy HCC may several advantage systemically administer treatment . Irradiating cancer prior treatment regional chemotherapy may effective either therapeutic modality alone . TheraSphere may also value 'bridging ' treatment HCC patient await donor organ liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
