	<brief_summary>Pre-portioned entrées commonly consume help control portion size limit energy intake . Few study , however , investigated influence characteristic pre-portioned entrées energy intake . This study investigate characteristic solid pre-portioned entrées , specifically , variation energy content energy density influence energy intake day . The investigator hypothesize reduce energy content energy density compulsory entrées act independently add together reduce daily energy intake .</brief_summary>
