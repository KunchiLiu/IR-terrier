	<brief_title>Allogeneic GM-CSF Vaccine Lenalidomide Treating Myeloma Patients With Near Complete Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single institution , single arm , Phase II study examine clinical efficacy allogeneic GM-CSF secreting myeloma vaccine combination lenalidomide . Fifteen ( 15 ) patient enrol study must two disease measurement ( include last one ) consistent near complete remission ( M-spike negative persistence immunofixation ) per criterion response 6 month period . Patients continue dose lenalidomide prior enrol need discontinue steroid least 4 week . Patients receive 4 vaccination day 14 ( +/-3 day ) cycle 1 , 2 , 3 6 enrollment include myeloma vaccine well Prevnar .</detailed_description>
