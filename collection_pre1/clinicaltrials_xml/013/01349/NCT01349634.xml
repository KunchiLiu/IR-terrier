	<brief_summary>Many school child Ethiopia mother know iodine deficient . Prevalence Amhara region around 29 % . Micronutrient Initiative , development organization base Ottawa , plan help iodize salt provide iodization machine iodine salt producer Lake Afdira salt produce distributed population Ethiopia . Although generally assume iodine important cognitive development , study examine effect iodize salt conduct . Studies use single dose iodine capsule child 6 12 year show mixed outcome approximately 25 % yield positive outcome intervention child . Sixty district Amhara randomly select randomly assign half receive early delivery iodize salt . Approximately 6200 mother child 6- , 18- , 60-months old recruit 1-2 village 60 district , help government-paid Health Extension Workers , 12-mo longitudinal study start May 2011 , prior introduction iodize salt . These mother child visit 12 month later repeat measure . Measures include nutritional status height hemoglobin , along iodine sufficiency ( e.g. , goitre , urinary iodine , thyroglobulin ) , child development ( Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development III , Wechsler Preschool Primary School Intelligence test old child ) . Comparisons make within group determine whether iodized salt effect child 's mental development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Iodized Salt Cognitive Development Ethiopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MATERIALS AND METHODS Sample size estimate basis Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development III ( Bayley ) mean 100 standard deviation 15 . Using effect size 0.20 standard deviation , beta .05 power .80 , accommodate cluster within village attrition , investigator require sample size 800 group ( intervention control ) . Severely anemic child ( &lt; 8 mg/L ) refer treatment include study . In longitudinal study investigator recruit 3200 6-mo old infant 1600 child two age group : 18- , 60-months ( inclusion criterion ) mother . The exclusion criterion : severe anemia ( hemoglobin &lt; 8g/dL ) . If child disable take cognitive test , note cognitive testing administer . From six zone around Bahir Dar , investigator randomly select 60 district . Half assign randomly start receive iodized salt July 2011 ; half receive iodized salt become available market . From district , 1-2 village randomly select recruit 30 child age group . It assume pregnancy rate 3.7 % , approximately 166 child bear every year village 4500 , 13 bear every month . So within 3 month , start May 2011 , 30 child age could recruit . With help Health Extension Workers , train field worker identify participant : child eligible age . Mothers provide write consent child participate . Mothers interview baseline endline concern family 's economic demographic information , child 's health diet , opportunity stimulation child ( Home Observation Measurement Environment Inventory ; Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale symptom score ) . Children 's nutritional status measure food frequency questionnaire , length/height , weight , blood indicator thyroid function ( thyroglobulin , thyroxin , triiodothyronine ) iron status ( hemoglobin , ferritin , soluble transferrin receptor ) , inflammation ( C-reactive protein ) , goiter , urinary iodine . A maximum 10 mL collect blood venipuncture . Finally , train assistant administer Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development III ( cognitive , language , fine motor scale ) child under-3 year two Wechsler Preschool Primary School Intelligence test subscales School Readiness test 60-month old . Salt collect various place purchase household test iodine content ( first qualitatively , quantitatively iodize ) baseline end study . All data collection do home convenient site village . Conversion diet iodine content do base food composition table . Anthropometric data convert standardized score use new World Health Organization reference curve , use World Health Organization 's software Anthro v. 2 child 60 month age . Analyses compare nutritional developmental outcome two group differ iodized salt exposure , covarying confounders mother 's education , family asset , child 's sex , adjust cluster . Developmental score derive Bayley subtests , Wechsler Preschool Primary School Intelligence test . These test typically assign 1 point every correct answer 0 point incorrect answer ; sum continuous score use analysis . Potential confounds include Home Observation Measurement Environment Inventory Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale symptom score , also calculate sum individual item point . Laboratory analysis conduct determine hemoglobin , ferritin , soluble transferrin receptor , thyroglobulin , thyroxin , triiodothyronine blood sample , iodine excretion urine sample . Analyses salt also indicate whether salt consume participant intervention district require ppm iodine salt consume control district . If household control sit high expect level iodine , record included analysis .</detailed_description>
