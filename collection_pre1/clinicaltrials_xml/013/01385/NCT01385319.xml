	<brief_summary>To prospectively evaluate multicenter open label trial whether use zotarolimus-eluting ENDEAVOR Stent implantation patient low restenosis high bleeding thrombotic risk decrease incidence 12-month major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) include overall death , myocardial infarction ( MI ) target vessel revascularization ( TVR ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zotarolimus-eluting Endeavor Sprint Stent Uncertain DES Candidates ( ZEUS ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study conduct multicenter , international , randomized trial test whether Endeavor stent superior BMS term efficacy safety 1 . Patients coronary artery disease lesion low risk in-stent restenosis ; 2 . Patients high risk bleed carry impossibility comply dual anti-platelet treatment long-term . 3 . Patients high thrombosis risk due systemic disorder plan non-cardiac surgery within 12 month As use DES two patient/lesion subset debate due lack evidence , patient fulfil least one three medical condition qualify bare metal stent implantation physician may believe DES even contra-indicated case . The current protocol develop purpose address value Endeavor Sprint stent , differs many aspect FDA approve DES , include fast complete degree strut coverage implantation quick release active drug deployment ( ~15 day ) may help decrease need prolonged dual antiplatelet treatment 1 month currently recommend bare metal stent implantation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A ) low restenosis risk base angiographic finding define follow : patient consider low restenosis risk plan stent low 3.0 mm intend implanted lesion expect leave main vein graft B ) high bleed risk and/or presence relativeabsolute contraindication dual antiplatelet treatment beyond 30 day define follow : 1 . Clinical indication treatment oral anticoagulant , include use warfarin dabigatran oral anticoagulant agent 2 . Recent ( within previous 12 month ) bleed episode ( ) require medical attention 3 . Previous bleed episode ( ) require hospitalization bleed diathesis completely resolve ( i.e . surgical removal bleed source ) 4 . Age great 80 5 . Systemic condition associate increase bleed risk ( e.g . hematological disorder know coagulopathy determine bleed diathesis , include history current thrombocytopenia define platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 ( &lt; 100 x 109/L ) . 6 . Known Anemia define repeatedly document hemoglobin lower 10 gr/dl due acute document blood loss 7 . Need chronic treatment steroid NSAID C ) Patients high thrombosis risk base presence least one follow criterion : 1 . Allergy/intolerance aspirin 2 . Allergy/intolerance clopidogrel AND ticlopidine 3 . Planned surgery ( skin ) within 12 month percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . 4. patient cancer ( skin ) life expectancy &gt; 1 year 5 . Patients systemic condition associate thrombosis diathesis ( e.g. , hematologic disorder know systemic condition determine prothrombotic state include immunological disorder ) Any follow : 1 . Women pregnant . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( urine serum HCG ) within 7 day prior randomization ; close randomization possible , within 24 hour prefer . 2 . Subjects unable give inform consent assurance complete contact 12 month . 3 . PCI stenting previous 6 month</criteria>
