	<brief_summary>This study test hypothesis 6 month periodic high dose Vitamin D3 replacement ( 200,000 100,000 unit cholecalciferol , oral liquid drop 6 8 week interval ) follow in-between daily 1000 unit , decrease insulin resistance HOMA2-IR ≥ 0.36 , comparison control , standard dose Vitamin D3 1000IU/ day 6 month , south Asians Vitamin D deficiency ( defined 25 Hydroxy vitamin D &lt; 25nmol/l ) insulin resistance ( define HOMA1 -IR≥ 1.93 ) . The hypothesis form suggest insulin resistance develop South Asians explain , least part , presence Vitamin D Deficiency ( VDD ) . Therefore VDD reversed/ 'normalised target range ' use Vitamin D therapy individual risk diabetes , marker insulin resistance reduce baseline value . However , current UK recommend dos Vitamin D adequately replenish severe VDD , common South Asians , back target range therefore reduce insulin resistance marker . Therefore high pharmacological dos able replace severe Vitamin D deficiency adequately improve insulin resistance marker .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardio metabolic risk South Asians Incident Cardiovascular Disease ( CVD ) within South Asian Diaspora fail decline parallel migrant group . Rates coronary disease middle-aged South Asians , 50 % high UK background , concern place grow socio-economic burden community health-care provider . Concerted effort recognise manage early CVD-risk within highly susceptible group essential persistent health inequality adequately address . Significant variation CVD imply differential interaction risk factor across population presence additional factor account increase risk . Metabolic condition prevalent South Asians characterise insulin resistance , glucose disorder dyslipidaemia may key address observed CVD difference . Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) develop early South Asians establish carry high risk vascular mortality . Prediabetes common South Asians associate independently vascular diabetes-risk . Ethnic pre-disposition central obesity metabolic consequence clearly important determine CVD risk , even combine factor ( e.g . social-economic deprivation , smoking , blood pressure ) fail entirely account observed variation vascular event group . Assumptions cultural incompatibility medication compliance influence CVD outcomes largely unsubstantiated , imply unidentified factor contribute increase risk South Asians . Vitamin D Deficiency ( VDD ) There resurgence interest recognition treatment VDD beyond establish role metabolic bone disease . Epidemiological study implicate vitamin D calcium homeostasis plethora non-skeletal immune-based chronic disease . Proposed mechanism account pleiotropic action focus upon well-characterised in-vitro immuno-modulatory effect , intracellular calcium signal recent find Vitamin D receptor ubiquitous . The emerge science connect biochemical deficiency , molecular cytokine response disease pathogenesis well-reviewed . VDD appear predispose vascular , rheumatic neuropathic inflammation , hypertension , metabolic syndrome atherosclerosis . Data large observational cohort trial design bone-related outcome consistently demonstrate inverse relationship ( 1 ) serum 25-hydroxy-cholecalciferol ( 25 ( OH ) VitD ) prevalent T2DM/CVD conversely , ( 2 ) supplementation incident cause mortality . Baseline serum 25 ( OH ) VitD predict future glycaemic status , whilst VDD associate marker insulin resistance , coronary calcification , aortic stiffness , leave ventricular mass , endothelial dysfunction , hypertension . Diabetes-related micro macro-vascular complication may exacerbate VDD . Reported Vitamin D intervention study far limit small sample size , inadequate replacement short intervention time . Whist variability study population , dosage regime endpoint make comparison available intervention data difficult , metabolic outcome trend definitely favour enhanced insulin sensitivity action . One study use 700 IUD3 daily two year , demonstrate glucose reduction IFG comparable intensive lifestyle intervention Diabetes Prevention Project . Conversely WHI study fail demonstrate Vitamin D effect either glycaemic blood pressure outcomes possibly sub-therapeutic 400 IU daily replacement increase serum 25 ( OH ) Vitamin D average 7nmol/l . In absence well-designed supplementation trial , strong evidence continue lie prospective association study neither confirm causality exclude confound influence . The optimal Vitamin D level define &gt; 75nmol/l , adequate level 50-75nmol/l , sub-optimal 25-50nmol/l deficient &lt; 25nmol/l . The South Asian VDD phenotype It plausible T2DM CVD prevalence South Asians relate directly sub-optimal Vitamin D status . This population ideal prospective phenotyping intervention trial remain large reservoir endemic VDD UK ( Leicester population data : 72 % 25 ( OH ) Vitamin D &lt; 20 nmol/l ) . Recognised cause VDD susceptibility South Asians include 1 ) skin complexion , 2 ) lack sunlight exposure , 3 ) vegetarianism , 4 ) adipose tissue vitamin sequestration , although surprisingly lack evidence support specific dose regime Vitamin D deplete population . Consensus algorithms replacement base predominantly bone-related outcome Caucasians unlikely adequately address VDD South Asians , indeed associate cardio-metabolic effect base upon currently available trial evidence . The prospect vitamin D supplementation potential intervention diabetes cardiovascular risk factor carry considerable public health implication . Far ethnic minority niche , VDD prevalence set rise line Western obesity trend . It therefore imperative investigator determine potential simple treatment prevention cardio-metabolic disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>We include follow people meet criterion : 1 . 2575 year old south Asian ( Bangladeshi , Indian Pakistani ) men woman . 2 . A low vitamin D level ( define specific marker , 25 ( OH ) VitD &lt; 25 nmol/L ) 3 . Insulin resistance , define homeostatic model assessment Insulin resistance ( HOMA1IR ) ≥ 1.93 . We exclude people one follow : 1 . Those told doctor diabetes ( Type 1 2 ) . 2 . Those developed new diabetes ( World Health Organisation ( WHO ) 1999 guideline ) detect Screening Visit fast glucose test ( participant offer confirmatory test determine diabetes oral glucose tolerance test ) oral glucose tolerance test Baseline Visit . Any individual new diabetes follow arrange doctor . If confirmatory test show new diabetes , participant eligible reenter study . 3 . HbA1c ≥ 7.0 % suggestive diabetes . 4 . Preexisting calcium and/or Vitamin D tablet ( D2 ergocalciferol D3 cholecalciferol ) / therapy ( e.g . intramuscular injection , oral liquid preparation ) previous adverse reaction Vitamin D ( D2 D3 ) . Any individual previously therapy must Vitamin D/ Calcium least six month . 5 . Pregnancy breast feeding female , actively trying/ intend become pregnant plan six month trial . 6 .
