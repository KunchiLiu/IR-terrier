	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate self-reported adherence effect intervention model consist individualize prescribed dietary advice ( DAP ) combination Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) , social support mobile service obese patient primary health care . The specific aim relate effect intervention model self-reported health , biomarkers coronary heart disease , diabetes , cancer form , sleep duration quality , health economy , oral health , dietary intake physical activity . This two-armed randomized control study . The arm : 1 ) Control group ( care usual ) 2 ) Experimental group ( MoR ) . The volunteer consecutively , sex , randomized experimental control group , respectively . The experimental group receive DAP together Motivational interview six month start study . From six month 24 month participant receive social support online mobile service . The control group receive dietary information accord `` Habo model '' . The previously mention diet recommend control group experimental group since method investigator give information want study diet per se . Thus , way investigator give dietary information differs group . The study also include qualitative interview . The aim study gain understanding patient ' health professional ' experience attitude around food , lifestyle support function associate dietary change . The sample approach involve purposeful selection case wide range variation , mean researcher selects people able provide rich information current issue .

	<detailed_description>The investigator assume difference BMI ( body mass index ; kg/m x ) 2 unit , standard deviation 4.5 unit , power 80 % , alfa error 5 % I two-tailed test , investigator would need least 80 individual experimental group control group , respectively . With 80 individual group assumption 5 % adherence ( 4 individual ) control group , investigator would able detect adherence 21 % high ( least 17 individual ) experimental group 80 % power . The alfa error set 5 % two-tailed test null hypothesis adherence group . Therefore investigator plan study least 100 individual group assume 20 % complete study . The evaluation quantitative study perform three way : 1 ) Process evaluation , focus intermediate outcome knowledge , attitude , motivation readiness change . 2 ) Effect evaluation use evaluate effect intervention programme subject ' behavior dietary intake physical activity level . 3 ) Outcome evaluation measure total effect intervention programme , case variable measure indicator health disease , SF-36 , EQ-5D , SHIS , serum cholesterol , blood pressure , BMI , waist circumference etc . Intention-to-treat ( ITT ) analysis use assess effect outcome measure . Variables normally distribute logarithmically transform . Paired t-test use assess change within group unpaired t-tests compare mean change group . Non-parametric statistic , Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test Mann-Whitney U-Test use ordinal data questionnaire . Two-tailed test use p-value less 0.05 consider statistically significant . Qualitative data analyze content analysis .</detailed_description>
