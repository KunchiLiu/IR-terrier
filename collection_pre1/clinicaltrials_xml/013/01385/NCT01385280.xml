	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth tumor cell . Hormone therapy use therapeutic estradiol may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Though estradiol initially produce stimulation ER+ cancer cell , laboratory clinical experience indicate may opposite effect cell , become resistant estrogen deprivation . In laboratory model , death `` resistant '' population estradiol treatment , follow restoration sensitivity remain cell estrogen deprivation , aromatase inhibitor . Exemestane may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving therapeutic estradiol together exemestane may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study therapeutic estradiol exemestane treat post-menopausal patient hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Estradiol Followed Exemestane Hormone Receptor + Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility toxicity associate estradiol follow exemestane treatment estrogen receptor positive metastatic breast cancer patient fail prior aromatase inhibitor therapy . II . Exploratory analysis bio-correlates evaluate mechanism action treatment combination : change serum M-30 , marker mitochondrial apoptosis ; change number circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) ; change CTC expression ER , IGF1-R , M-30 . III . Exploratory analysis Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral therapeutic estradiol daily day 1-3 , twice daily day 4-7 , thrice daily day 8-90 . Beginning day 98 , patient receive oral exemestane daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
