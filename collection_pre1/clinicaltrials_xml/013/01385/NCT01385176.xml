All CRT patient must CRT least 1 year prior enrollment . The total number CRT patient exceed 30 Patients locally implant semi/permanent device vascular catheter , etc . would interfere NECTARHF study system Patients previously implant device right side become infected removal Patients previous neck surgery resultant scar formation interfere ability implant study system right side neck ( Thyroid/parathyroid , carotid artery etc ) Patients known recurrent nerve paralysis Patients undergone radiotherapy thyroid disease/cancer Patients exist prior tracheotomy Patients severe vertebral cervical disease limit mobility neck ; include frequently wear brace Patients carotid murmur/vascular bruit/carotid artery lesion Patients known/suspected vascular malformation carotid/vertebral circulatory bed Patients likely need MRI neck area previous medical condition</criteria>
