Microincision surgery many advantage , include reduce surgically induced astigmatism , faster visual recovery , reduce intra postoperative inflammation . Curently , microcoaxial phacoemulsification perform 1.8 well 2.2 mm incision . However , still debate best absolute incision size microcoaxial cataract surgery . The aim study evaluate incision stability follow microcoaxial phacoemulsification perform 1.8 2.2 mm system , well compare intraoperative performance postoperative outcome follow microcoaxial phacoemulsification perform two incision size .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes Following Phacoemulsification With 1.8 &amp; 2.2mm Incision : Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cataract surgical technique significantly change recent year widespread adoption small small clear corneal incision phacoemulsification . Microincision surgery many advantage , include reduce surgically induced astigmatism , faster visual recovery , reduce intra postoperative inflammation . In recent time , microcoaxial phacoemulsification gain popularity . The main advantage newer technique use method conventional method small incision . Curently , microcoaxial phacoemulsification perform 1.8 well 2.2 mm incision . However , still debate best absolute incision size microcoaxial cataract surgery . The aim study evaluate incision stability follow microcoaxial phacoemulsification perform 1.8 2.2 mm system , well compare intraoperative performance postoperative outcome follow microcoaxial phacoemulsification perform two incision size .</detailed_description>
