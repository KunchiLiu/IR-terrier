	<brief_summary>A research study learn biologic feature cancer development , growth , spread . We study component blood , tumor tissue , normal tissue , fluid , urine , cerebrospinal fluid , abdominal chest fluid patient cancer . Our analysis blood , tissue , and/or fluid may lead improved diagnosis treatment cancer identification marker predict clinical outcome , marker predict response specific therapy , identification target new therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In United States , estimate 222,520 lung bronchus cancer diagnose 2010 , 157,300 people die disease . Therefore , urgent need safer effective therapy lung cancer.1 Lung cancer fall two major classification , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) account approximately 87 % , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , account remainder . Thymomas common tumor anterior mediastinum , typically occur adult older 40 year . While surgical resection radiation often effectively treat tumor , minority continue progress eventually lead death . Thymic carcinoma relate subset tumor often metastasize aggressive . Finally , mesothelioma often behave aggressively lung cancer , frequently amenable curative resection . While role molecular alteration yet define treatment SCLC , thymoma , mesothelioma , increase recognition molecular alteration NSCLC important predictor response novel target therapy . Small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal pathway , erlotinib gefitinib , improve survival second-line treatment unselected patient NSCLC . However , retrospective subgroup analysis clinical trial reveal patient particular clinical feature likely benefit therapy , tumor adenocarcinoma histology , woman , Asian ethnicity , light never smoker . Conventional Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) sequence tumor multiple series patient dramatic response gefitinib , compare patient without response , reveal presence characteristic genetic mutation EGFR gene.4-6 The previously identify clinical marker response EGFR TKIs find commonly associate presence mutation ; thus , clinical feature actually believe surrogate molecular biomarker EGFR mutation . Over 90 % EGFR tyrosine kinase domain mutation associate sensitivity EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy fall two category , in-frame deletion exon 19 , L858R point mutation exon 21 . These mutation appear specifically activate cell proliferation , via activation MAP kinase pathway , survival signal , via activation PI3 kinase pathway.7 Therefore , tumor EGFR mutation `` oncogene addict '' EGFR survival signal , rely exclusively upon EGFR signal cascade maintain viability , explain exquisite sensitivity TKI therapy . A number recent large randomize study conclusively demonstrate clinical selection patient alone inadequate , instead establish EGFR mutation status single important predictive marker response EGFR-TKI therapy.8-10 In another emerge similar story , genetic fusion anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) tyrosine kinase partner protein , EML4 , appear strongly predict sensitivity ALK TKI , crizotinib . 11 In addition , evidence less common mutation NSCLC , BRAF mutation ERBB2 ( e.g . HER2 ) mutation , may also predict response target therapy . In summary , identification genetic alteration NSCLC increasingly essential individualize treatment perform molecular diagnostics . While investigator anticipate benefit individual patient , identification molecular alteration small cell lung cancer , thymic malignancy , mesothelioma may provide similar key utilization novel therapy . This project aim create registry patient tumor characterization molecular alteration thoracic malignancy develop marker early detection .</detailed_description>
