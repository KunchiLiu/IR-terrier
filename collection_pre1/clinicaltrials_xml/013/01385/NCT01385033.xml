	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate radiolabeled [ 18F ] MK-3328 PET tracer estimate regional distribution extent amyloid plaques participant suffer amnestic mild cognitive impairment ( aMCI ) Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) versus healthy young elderly participant . The study hypotheses test whether [ 18F ] MK-3328 discriminate AD participant cognitively normal elderly control participant measure brain regional tracer uptake .</brief_summary>
