	<brief_summary>The primary objective study establish feasibility safety infusion placental Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( MSC ) relate unrelated HLA identical HLA mismatch donor treatment Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) . The secondary objective document change lung function , 6 minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) , gas exchange radiological appearance follow infusion MSC six month evaluation period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Potential Role Mesenchymal Stem Cells Treatment Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I , open-label , single centre , non-randomized dose-escalation evaluation safety feasibility MSC treatment subject diagnose IPF . The first 4 patient receive dose 1 x 10^6 placenta-derived MSC/kg . An interim safety analysis carry Data Safety Management Board ( DSMB ) first 4 patient undergone 3 month study visit . Should serious adverse event document due , likely due , MSC infusion , subsequent 4 patient receive IV infusion 2 x 10^6 placenta-derived MSC/kg . Therefore total eight ( 8 ) subject meet eligibility criterion provide write informed consent enrol study .</detailed_description>
