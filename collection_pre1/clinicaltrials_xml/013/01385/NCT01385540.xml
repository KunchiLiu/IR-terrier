	<brief_summary>This experimental task-based functional MRI pilot study involve neuroimaging assessment patient severely bothersome tinnitus , define global bothersome scale . The investigator plan enroll total 12 participant ( 6 severely bother tinnitus 6 age-matched non-tinnitus control ) course six month undergo task-based imaging . Subjects tinnitus group may previously participate CTRWU study ( HRPO : 07-0689 ) conduct Dr. Jay Piccirillo Washington University give permission contact consideration future study . The select paradigm allow u advance knowledge role attention , control , cortical network development maintenance bothersome tinnitus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Task-Based Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) The task-based fMRI protocol base work perform Washington University Dr. Gordon Shulman publish The Journal Neuroscience . ( Shulman , Astafiev , Franke , Pope , Snyder , McAvoy , Corbetta 2009 ) Individuals show target , randomly select 12 object designate target , scan . The target scan never appear non-target object another scan . Per establish protocol , individual fixate central cross prior image . Individuals press MR-compatible button detect target . Target object appear cue stream . Cues , fill red square , program occur , average , every 2.06 , 4.12 , 6.18 second within temporal window ± 400 millisecond centered value .</detailed_description>
