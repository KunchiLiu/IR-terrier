	<brief_summary>Red yeast rice capsule ( LipoCol Forte ) nature product demonstrate significant cholesterol lower effect might cause addictive and/or synergistic effect lovastatin ( monacolin K ) monacolins substances capsule . The usual dose red yeast rice capsule ( LipoCol Forte ) hypercholesterolemia one capsule twice/day . Gemfibrozil fibric acid derivative ( fibrate ) . It reduce level triglyceride increase level high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) . Patients mixed lipid disorder may therefore benefit combination statin fibrate . Although combination fibrate statin highly effective , concern increase incidence myopathy even rhabdomyolysis limit widespread use combination . Such combination therapy prone drug-drug interaction , lead alter pharmacokinetic profile either drug , effect observe many statin combination fibrates . However , drug-drug interaction report red yeast rice capsule gemfibrozil . The objective study evaluate effect gemfibrozil plasma concentration lovastatin active form , lovastatin acid , red yeast rice capsule healthy volunteer . In addition , investigator also measure plasma concentration creatine kinase ( CK ) co-enzyme Q10 safety assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomize , crossover study design 2 period use . The washout time period 4 day . In first period , 600 mg red yeast rice capsule ( LipoCol ) administer orally 240 mL water 8 AM . In second period , subject take 600 mg gemfibrozil ( two Lopid 300-mg capsule ) 7 AM 7 PM 2 day . On day 3 , subject take 600 mg gemfibrozil 7 AM 600 mg red yeast rice capsule administer orally 240 mL water 8 AM . The volunteer fast overnight , breakfast dinner sever 0.5 hour administration gemfibrozil . In addition , high fat breakfast serve 0.5 hour standard meal serve 4 10 hour administration red yeast rice ( LipoCol ) . The blood sample draw prior dose , 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 12 hour administration red yeast rice ( LipoCol ) detect plasma concentration lovastatin lovastatin acid . In addition , blood sample draw prior dose , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 12 hour administration red yeast rice ( LipoCol ) detect plasma concentration creatine kinase ( CK ) co-enzyme Q10 .</detailed_description>
