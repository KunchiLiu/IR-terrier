	<brief_summary>Environmental pollutant might jointly responsible increase infertility among woman . Especially endocrin active substance seem particular importance . These substance chemical interfere physiological system human animal . They negative impact endocrine system disturb function organ whose hormone regulate male female reproductive system . It known exposition chemical lead subfertility , infertility , raise abortion , birth defect ovarian malfunction . Additionally show human embryo decrease cleavage rate IVF develop oocyte elevate concentration environmental pollutant . In study main focus concentrate Nonylphenols ( NP ) . Follicular fluid woman subfertility analyze newly develop principle include HPLC NMR-Spectroscopy . This enable quantitative qualitative analysis enantiomer NP . The result allow risk estimation several endocrine active substance , especially NP . Additionally conclusion concern correlation thes substance subfertility drawn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exposure environmental toxin may responsible female infertility . In particular substance know endocrine disrupting chemical ( EDCs ) may play crucial role . These environmental toxin either synthetic chemical use industry , agriculture pharmacy , natural chemical find food . Thus , exposure EDCs occur different way , e.g . drinking contaminated water , breathe contaminate air , simple food intake . Despite EDCs exhibit long half-life , continuous accumulation endocrine active substance occur globally . In addition , low water-solubility extremely high lipid-solubility promote accumulation within human organism . Consequently , EDCs may harm human health . It known EDCs lead disruption physiological system endocrine active substance interfere endocrine homeostasis . Moreover , EDCs alter organ regulate male female hormonal regulation crucial reproduction fitness . Sterility infertility , dysfunctional ovary increase risk abortion discuss critical consequence EDC exposure . It show endocrine active substance present follicle fluid woman unfilled pregnancy . Oocytes follicle increase concentration environmental toxin exhibit reduce developmental potential . Additionally , woman increase level EDC Bisphenol A tend exhibit increase risk abort . Nonylphenol ( NP ) belong class endocrine active substance special importance due high longevity toxic characteristic . Nonylphenol multi-compound mixture become generate by-product degeneration nonylphenol-ethoxylates ( NPE ) due biological wastewater treatment . NPE components several clean agent , emulsifier , disperse agent pesticide . NP mixture consist mainly para-substituted mono-alkylphenols different isomeric nonyl-groups . Despite high persistence toxicity , exposure NP induce alteration endocrine homeostasis water organism , bird mammal . NP potentially bind different hormone receptor ( e.g . estrogen receptor , progesteron receptor androgen receptor ) induce modulate hormone-dependent downstream pathway . The influence regard reproductive fitness much high female compare male . In planned study , follicle fluid analyze particular appearance NP . Analysis do Institute environmental research ( Dortmund ) group Prof. Spiteller . Basis analysis chiral gas chromatography - mass spectroscopy optimize qualitative quantitative assessment NP isomer . For detail , see trial design research set . Until , two preliminary test series do 34 test person . Within first series measurement , four patient exhibit increased NP concentration follicle fluid ( 13.7 20.9 ng/g compare 2.1 9 ng/g ) . In second test series , NP concentration less prominent analyzed patient ( average 1 ng/ml ) , detection NP still possible . Thus , NP detect analyzed follicle fluid sample . However , different NP concentration among tested patient claim certainly question , whether different concentration induce biological effect . The analysis large proband cohort regard appearance NP within follicle fluid facilitate possibility estimate risk appraisal patient unfilled pregnancy . Several parameter include evaluation : number MII oocytes , fertilization rate , embryo quality , pregnancy rate , implantation rate rate abortion . Despite duration infertility number previous IVF cycle consider , feasible determine correlation appearance NP within follicle fluid unfilled desire child .</detailed_description>
