	<brief_title>Axitinib Before Surgery Treating Patients With High-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine axitinib modulates pre-metastatic niche density patient high-risk prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pre-metastatic niche density regional lymph node ( LNs ) associate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . To determine therapy axitinib prolongs time biochemical recurrence . III . To determine phosphorylated form signal transducer activator transcription ( pSTAT ) 3 tumor tissue associate biochemical recurrence . IV . To determine myeloid derive suppressor cell ( MDSC ) recruitment tumor tissue associate biochemical recurrence . V. To determine lysyl oxidase ( LOX ) expression tumor tissue associate biochemical recurrence . VI . To evaluate time metastatic recurrence . VII . To determine rate erectile dysfunction urinary incontinence ( grade &gt; = 3 ) set preoperative axitinib therapy . VIII . To evaluate change blood-based biomarkers ( pSTAT3 select angiogenic factor ) baseline time prostatectomy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive axitinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Patients undergo prostatectomy pelvic lymph node dissection . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients undergo prostatectomy pelvic lymph node dissection 5-6 week biopsy confirmation prostate cancer . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
