	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Human Hookworm Candidate Vaccine With Different Doses Novel Adjuvant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human hookworm infection soil-transmitted helminth infection cause nematode parasite Necator americanus Ancylostoma duodenale . It one common chronic infection human , afflict 740 million people develop nation tropic . The large number case occur impoverished rural area sub-Saharan Africa , Southeast Asia , China , tropical region Americas . Approximately 3.2 billion people risk hookworm infection area . N. americanus common hookworm worldwide , whereas A. duodenale geographically restrict . The primary approach hookworm control worldwide frequent periodic mass administration benzimidazole anthelminthic school-aged child live high-prevalence area . In 2001 , World Health Assembly adopt Resolution 54.19 urge member state provide regular anthelminthic treatment high-risk group target regular treatment least 75 % at-risk school-aged child . However , cure rate single dose benzimidazole varies rate low 61 % ( 400 mg ) 67 % ( 800 mg ) albendazole 19 % ( single dose ) 45 % ( repeat dose ) mebendazole report . These concern prompt interest develop alternative tool hookworm control . Vaccination prevent anemia associate moderate heavy intensity hookworm infection would alleviate public health deficiency drug treatment alone . The current strategy development Human Hookworm candidate vaccine focus antigen express adult stage hookworm life cycle play role digest host hemoglobin , use worm energy source . These antigen relatively hidden human immune system natural infection , hence low likelihood induce antigen-specific IgE exposed/infected individual , reduce potential allergic reaction upon vaccination . The nutritional metabolic requirement adult hookworm living human intestine dependent upon degradation host hemoglobin ingest worm . N. americanus hookworm depend host hemoglobin survival . Following hemolysis , adult hookworm use order cascade hemoglobinases cleave hemoglobin small molecule . Following hemoglobin digestion , free heme generates toxic oxygen radical bind detoxified molecule glutathione S-transferase-1 ( GST-1 ) . GST-1 N. americanus ( Na-GST-1 ) critical enzyme play role parasite blood feeding ; use vaccine , investigator hypothesize antigen induce anti-enzyme neutralizing antibody interfere parasite blood-feeding cause parasite death reduce worm fecundity . Following selection candidate antigen Na-GST-1 successfully manufacture tested laboratory animal Alhydrogel® ( aluminum hydroxide suspension ) Alhydrogel® plus Gluco-Pyranosylphospho-Lipid A Aqueous Formulation ( GLA-AF ) . Na-GST-1 show pure , potent , stable administer either two formulation . Although GLA-AF yet administer human , oil-in-water emulsion GLA ( GLA-SE ) use combination Fluzone® trivalent kill influenza vaccine Phase 1 trial . In study , dose 1 µg GLA-SE safe well-tolerated significantly enhance influenza-specific antibody response . The phase 1 trial describe enroll healthy adult infect exposed hookworm live Washington DC area . A phase 1 trial Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel ( without GLA-AF ) plan start July 2011 Brazil . In study , hookworm-naïve hookworm-exposed healthy adult vaccinate either Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® , Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® co-administered 1 µg GLA-AF , Butang® hepatitis B vaccine . The objective study assess safety immunogenicity Na-GST-1 formulation healthy Brazilian adult . The study describe complement study Brazilian adult provide additional information different dose concentration GLA-AF well detail data humoral immune response different formulation test . In study , 90 volunteer progressively enrol one six dose cohort . Dose cohort enrol vaccinated consecutive fashion . The 15 volunteer cohort subsequently randomize 1:2 ratio receive either Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® ( n=5 ) Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel®/GLA-AF ( n=10 ) . In first , third fifth cohort , volunteer randomize receive either Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® ( n=5 ) OR Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® co-administered 1 µg GLA-AF ( n=10 ) , second , fourth , sixth cohort , volunteer randomize receive either Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® ( n=5 ) Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® co-administered 5 µg GLA-AF ( n=10 ) . Each participant receive 3 dos assign study agent give 56 day interval ( i.e . Day 0 , Day 56 Day 112 ) . The trial expect last approximately 18 month . Each participant follow 16 month time first injection . Safety parameter monitor throughout study . The primary endpoint study measurement antigen-specific antibody response .</detailed_description>
