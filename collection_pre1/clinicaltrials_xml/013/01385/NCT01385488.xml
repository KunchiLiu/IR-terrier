	<detailed_description>Breast cancer treatment-related lymphedema ( swell ) incurable , chronic condition experience significant percentage breast cancer survivor . It many associate symptom , negatively impact quality life ( QOL ) , increase health care cost . As chronic disease , diabetes , life-long self-care require . No objective measurement mechanism exist easily use self-monitor arm volume , key self-care outcome . Those lymphedema force rely visual recognition increase volume know self-care effective seek treatment . Timely recognition worsen swell believe result well patient outcome ; however , substantial volume increase often occur observable change note window opportunity miss . Many lymphedema seek care develop infection swell limb . The inability objectively monitor arm volume regular basis likely result discomfort , poor QOL , increase health care costs.The broad , long-term objective application develop method monitoring arm lymphedema use home improve lymphedema self-management patient outcome . To accomplish , investigator conduct two-phase , translational pilot study explore use hand-held bioelectrical impedance device arm volume self-measurement method . The purpose Phase 1 develop bioelectrical impedance self-measurement protocol . Healthy volunteer ( n=11 ) individual lymphedema ( n=11 ) Phase 1 ( protocol development ) . This take place laboratory home setting . This Phase interventional detail posting . The purpose Phase 2 compare self-care activity health economic outcome breast cancer survivor lymphedema follow self-monitoring protocol develop Phase 1 breast cancer survivor lymphedema protocol ( n=42 ) .The protocol field-tested breast cancer survivor lymphedema Phase 2 ( two group randomize clinical trial ) . One group self-measure impedance home three month , weekly record self-care activity , complete follow-up assessment . The group mirror Group 1 except impedance measurement . This interventional study present clinical trial posting .</detailed_description>
