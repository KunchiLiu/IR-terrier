	<brief_summary>Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) high-risk genotype necessary risk factor development cervical cancer . There vaccine available prevent cervical lesion associate high-risk HPV genotypes 16 18 . In Croatia HPV vaccination yet introduce obligatory vaccination schedule . The aim study describe pre-vaccination distribution HPV genotypes woman high grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion ( HSIL ) cervical cancer Croatia . The investigator hypothesis HPV-16 frequently find genotype distribution HPV genotypes heterogeneous include genotype currently cover vaccination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-center cross-sectional study molecular virology human papillomavirus ( HPV ) Croatia . The study enroll woman age 18-65 year age cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN2+ ) cervical lesion receive clinical care Croatian Center Pre-malignant Malignant Diseases Cervix . Women abnormal cytology ( high grade cervical squamous intraepithelial lesion-HSIL , cervical cancer ) period 2010 2012 include . Relevant epidemiological clinical data collect . Biological sample include biopsy specimen cervix cervical swab . Biological sample put Digene Specimen Transport Medium ( Qiagen , Gaithersburg , MD ) analyze Department Molecular Diagnostics University Hospital Infectious Diseases Zagreb . HPV genotyping perform use standardized molecular assay INNO-LiPA HPV Genotyping Extra Test ( Solvay S.A. , Brussels , Belgium ) . Analysis genomic variant HPV 16 genotype perform population-based sequencing L1 genome region .</detailed_description>
