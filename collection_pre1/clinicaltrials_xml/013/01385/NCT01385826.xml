	<brief_summary>The investigator propose study efficacy adalimumab versus placebo ( double-blind randomization inclusion 2 equal group ) reduction ocular inflammation quantify laser flare photometry two month treatment patient active uveitis despite well conduct treatment steroid eye drop MTX . The primary objective demonstrate high response rate 2 month adalimumab arm versus placebo arm . Will consider respond patient evaluate eye , 2 month inclusion , present least 30 % reduction inflammation laser flare photometry improvement stable appearance slit lamp examination . After second month , patient wish continue trial present satisfactory clinical state treat adalimumab total one year inclusion descriptively evaluate efficacy safety treatment 10 12 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Adalimumab Treatment Uveitis Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>20 % patient juvenile idiopathic arthritis ( JIA ) develop usually bilateral , chronic anterior uveitis , dependent steroid eye drop sometimes systemic steroid therapy , risk complication cataract , band keratopathy glaucoma , usually responsible loss vision . No maintenance treatment demonstrate effective . Methotrexate ( MTX ) , maintenance treatment commonly use JIA , could beneficial effect , effect sufficient stop progression uveitis patient . Our preliminary experience team base small series patient favour efficacy anti-Tumour Necrosis Factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) monoclonal antibody ( Ab ) JIA-associated uveitis . An international multicentre randomize trial humanize monoclonal antibody , adalimumab , JIA demonstrate efficacy joint lesion good safety monotherapy combination methotrexate . However , child active uveitis exclude trial . The investigator propose French multicentre , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial evaluate efficacy adalimumab JIA-associated uveitis patient age 4 year . These patient must active uveitis ( Laser flare-cell meter score least 30 photons/ms ) despite topical steroid therapy , intolerance failure least 3 month MTX therapy . The dose adalimumab 40 mg eow child age 13 child young 13 adalimumab 24 mg per m2 BSA ( maximum total body dose 40 mg ) . The activity uveitis evaluate laser flare photometry , recently validate technique follow-up efficacy treatment anterior uveitis . Seven hospital ophthalmology department France equip laser flare photometry sufficient experience participate trial ( Paris-Pitie-Salpetriere , Paris-Cochin , Nantes , Lille , Grenoble , Bordeaux Lyon ) . Several team paediatric rheumatologist hospital rheumatologist work ophthalmology department also able include patient . The primary endpoint least 30 % reduction ocular inflammation 2 month treatment , quantify laser flare photometry , consider severely affect eye case bilateral uveitis . Based hypothesis response rate least 50 % adalimumab versus maximum 10 % placebo , comparison two group 19 patient would sufficient conclude significant difference two-sided alpha risk p=0.05 power 80 % . The investigator therefore plan include 40 patient randomization two equal group , one receive 4 subcutaneous injection adalimumab receive 4 injection placebo D0 , D14 , D28 , D42 assessment primary endpoint M2 . The planned duration inclusion 2 year total duration trial 3 year . From visit M2 onwards , patient treat adalimumab injection every 2 week follow 1 year treatment . Clinical , laboratory ophthalmological evaluation include laser flare photometry conventional slit lamp examination perform visit ( pre-inclusion , D0 , D14 , M1 , M2 , M3 , M4 , M5 , M6 , M9 M12 ) . Deterioration ocular inflammation first 2 month justify decode patient concern consider treatment failure . A study conduct parallel : gene expression profile study whole blood team experience study JIA inflammatory disease ( Dr Pascual , Dallas , USA ) .</detailed_description>
