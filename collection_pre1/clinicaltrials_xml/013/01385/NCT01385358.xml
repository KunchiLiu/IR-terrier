	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common arrhythmia worldwide lead significant morbidity mortality , pose increase public health burden . Restoration sinus rhythm ( SR ) prefer strategy symptomatic patient outcomes anti-arrhythmic drug ( AAD ) poor . The alternative AAD two-fold.Firstly , catheter ablation ( CA ) - technique use catheter ( thin tube ) deliver small 'heat lesion ' area heart eliminate AF . Secondly , surgical ablation , multiple incision make atrium restore SR. Long term result traditional surgical approach excellent however technically difficult open-heart procedure significant morbidity mortality , seldom use . CA effective restore SR early stage AF paroxysmal ( intermittent ) rhythm disturbance . If treat stage AF inevitably evolve persistent permanent state becomes difficult treat CA . Therefore , optimum approach treat patient symptomatic long stand persistent AF yet determine remains key area on-going research . New minimally invasive , thoracoscopically assist surgical ( closed-heart ) approach recently develop ablate wide area around pulmonary vein , may offer advantage best current strategy CA . There also clear advantage patient great safety less discomfort compare traditional surgical open-heart procedure . At present small amount encourage data thoracoscopic surgical technique data compare two modality treatment persistent AF patient . The investigator therefore wish prospectively investigate safety efficacy thoracoscopic surgical technique compare CA group patient . MRI scan also use visualise effect ablation analysis scar formation . The study hypothesise thoracoscopics surgical ablation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Catheter Versus Thoracoscopic Surgical Ablation Strategy Persistent Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot , prospective , observational study catheter ablation compare thoracoscopically assist , surgical ablation strategy use case control design . The study population patient age 18 80 symptomatic long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation ( ≥1≤5 year ) good leave ventricular function least one anti-arrhythmic drug ( AAD ) fail , drug contraindicate tolerate . Thoracoscopically Assisted Surgical Ablation Group Patients assign group undergo minimally invasive , thoracoscopically assist , surgical ablation isolate pulmonary vein ( PVI ) use radiofrequency ( RF ) clamp device . This include ganglionated plexi ablation +/- LAA excision/exclusion . Catheter Ablation Group Patients undergo pulmonary vein isolation , linear electrogram base ablation . Recurrences Only one redo procedure allow atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence 12 month follow-up period .</detailed_description>
