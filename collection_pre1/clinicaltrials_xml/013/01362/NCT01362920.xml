	<brief_summary>In 2005 , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve procalcitonin conjunction laboratory marker aid risk assessment critically ill patient severe infection ( sepsis ) . Although considerable literature exist regard usefulness Procalcitonin ( PCT ) marker sepsis , still potential us PCT measurement yet explore value among critically ill patient remain unclear . This study seek good understand usefulness measure PCT value patient admit Medical ICU variety reason particular severe infection ( sepsis ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Prognostic Value Serial Procalcitonin ( PCT ) Measurements Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procalcitonin ( PCT ) 116 amino acid peptide approximate MW 14.5 kDa belongs calcitonin ( CT ) superfamily peptides . Transcription CALC-1 gene PCT usually suppress non-neuroendocrine tissue , except C cell thyroid gland expression produce PCT , precursor CT healthy individual absence infection . In presence microbial infection , circulate level calcitonin precursor ( CTpr ) , include PCT , increase several thousand-fold.1 In addition marker microbial infection , PCT also act modulator host inflammatory reaction . In animal model sepsis , administration exogenous human PCT worsen outcome , whereas neutralization endogenous PCT improve survival . There several inflammatory laboratory marker , like tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α , interleukin ( IL ) -1 , IL-6 C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , non- specific infection cause condition like pancreatitis , burn , trauma acute lung injury . The non-specific nature clinical laboratory parameter microbial infection make difficult evaluate patient potential infection . In addition lack specificity , traditional laboratory clinical indicator sepsis temporally concordant course illness . As result , test reliable evaluate response therapeutic intervention real time .</detailed_description>
