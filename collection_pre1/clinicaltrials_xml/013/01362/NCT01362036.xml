	<brief_summary>Phase 1 , single-center , open-label , sequential cohort dose escalation study . This 3 + 3 design study involve least 3 subject ascend dose cohort , subject participate 10 week . The overall study objective evaluate safety tolerability TXA127 thrombocytopenic subject low intermediate-1 risk MDS . Evaluation platelet response erythroid granulocytic response TXA127 provide preliminary efficacy data .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Evaluating TXA127 Low/Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome Thrombocytopenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The hematopoietic property demonstrate preclinical clinical study support investigation TXA127 stimulate stem cell progenitor cell proliferation . This exploratory study limit population low intermediate-1 MDS subject platelet count ≤50 x 109/L evaluate effect TXA127 platelet response granulocytic erythroid response . Platelet response define complete major : - Complete platelet response : increase platelet count &gt; 100 x 109/L - Major platelet response : increase absolute platelet count &gt; 30 x 109/L Other response accord modify IWG MDS criterion ( 2006 ) . Daily subcutaneous dose TXA carry clinic schedule visit home clinic visit period fo 28 day .</detailed_description>
