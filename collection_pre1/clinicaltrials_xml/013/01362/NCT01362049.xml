	<brief_summary>The research objective determine physical therapy ( PT ) treatment efficacious patient low back pain ( LBP ) , subgrouped base certain clinical feature . There limited evidence support one PT treatment patient LBP since PT treatment outcome exercise protocols equivocal , give heterogeneous clinical feature patient LBP . Thus , classification patient LBP subgroup share clinical feature identify research priority several group order prescribe efficacious PT treatment homogeneous subgroup . The investigator hypothesize particular PT treatment efficacious applied patient LBP , present particular clinical neuromuscular feature .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study focus 2 schemas classify LBP : 1 ) Treatment-Based Classification ( TBC ) system , clinical prediction rule likely benefit spinal stabilization exercise ( among others ) develop , 2 ) Movement System Impairment-Based Classification ( MSI ) system , include 5 classification LBP name specific direction ( ) movements alignment associate person 's LBP . The primary purpose proposal conduct prospective , randomize , control Phase II clinical trial order examine whether treatment match patient 's specific sign symptom ( patient-matched ) per TBC effective MSI system improve short- ( 6 week ) long-term ( 12 24 month ) outcomes people chronic LBP . A secondary purpose identify prognostic factor predict clinical outcome 2 treatment group compare . Subjects assign one two study arm : 1. eligible Treatment-Based Classification ( TBC ) stabilization exercise base current criterion ( 'Eligible ' Subject Group ) ; 2. subject eligible TBC-based stabilization exercise ( 'Ineligible ' Subject Group ) . Within study arm , subject randomly assign 1 2 exercise protocol 6-week period : 1. stabilization - protocol focus improve motor control trunk muscle stabilize spine ; 2 . MSI-based - classification-specific treatment focus education instruction modify movement strategy functional activity , exercise specific classification category . Laboratory measure ( muscle activation , kinematics , force ) standardize task quantify neuromuscular impairment associate LBP clinical questionnaire quantify change pain , function , health status pre- post-treatment . The addition neuromuscular measure classification schema could improve sensitivity specificity .</detailed_description>
