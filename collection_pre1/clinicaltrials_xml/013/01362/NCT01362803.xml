	<brief_title>AZD6244 Hydrogen Sulfate Children With Nervous System Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Patients Neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1 ) increase risk develop tumor central peripheral nervous system , include plexiform neurofibroma ( PN ) , benign nerve sheath tumor among debilitate complication NF1 . PN may congenital appear fast growth rate young child . Surgery standard treatment option available PN . However , often difficult due encasement vital structure , extensive invasive PN growth . - PN compose neoplastic Schwann cell lack NF1 gene expression . This result upregulation Ras , initiate several signal cascade regulate cell proliferation . - Selumetinib ( AZD6244 hyd sulfate ) , novel orally bioavailable mitogen activate protein kinase inhibitor , specific inhibitor MEK 1 , may mediate anti-tumor effect PN inhibition downstream signal Ras . Selumetinib currently undergo evaluation adult cancer child brain tumor . - In phase I study selumetinib direct NF1 PN , observe degree activity Objectives Phase I : - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral selumetinib administer daily pediatric patient NF1 inoperable PN . Based result dose escalation study , current MTD determine 20 mg/m2/dose . To consistent pediatric dosing , additional dose level 25 mg/m2/dose add , MTD recently determine study conduct Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium ( PBTC ) . Amendment H ( November 2014 ) : The MTD determine 25 mg/m ( 2 ) /dose . - To define acute chronic toxicity pharmacokinetics ( PK ) selumetinib . Completed amendment H. - To determine effect selumetinib growth rate PN . Phase II : - Primary objective : To evaluate confirm partial complete response rate selumetinib use volumetric MRI analysis child young adult NF1 inoperable PN PN related morbidity time enrollment . - Secondary objective include evaluation : - confirm partial complete response rate ( See section 5.2 ) selumetinib overall population patient treat ( patient without PN related morbidity time enrollment ) , typical PN versus nodular PN versus solitary nodular PN . - long-term tolerability safety selumetinib - duration response - effect selumetinib bone mineral density patient NCI decrease bone mineral density time enrollment . - effect selumetinib pain , quality life , physical functioning , disfigurement - PN growth rate base volumetric MRI analysis - time progression ( TTP ) progression free survival ( PFS ) - effect selumetinib pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) peripheral blood bone marrow derive precursor cell cytokine . - effect selumetinib ERK phosphorylation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . Eligibility Pediatric Patients ( great equal 2 less equal 18 year ) able swallow intact capsule , NF1 inoperable measurable PN potential cause significant morbidity . Design - Selumetinib administer orally BID continuous dose schedule ( 28 day = 1 treatment cycle ) . In phase I portion , limit dose escalation perform define MTD base tolerability selumetinib first three treatment cycle . In phase II portion , recommend phase II dose level ( RP2D ) administer . - Phase II : Patients enrol one two stratum : - Stratum 1 : PN relate morbidity present enrollment -- -PN related pain , disfigurement , difficulty physical function - Stratum 2 : No significant PN related morbidity present enrollment , potential development PN morbidity - Patient report functional outcome evaluate regular interval . - Disease status evaluate use volumetric MRI analysis regular interval . - The day 1 steady state plasma PK PD selumetinib evaluate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age Phase I : great 3 year less equal 18 year time study enrollment , able swallow whole capsule . The age limit include young child choose early childhood puberty consider great risk disease progression , selumetinib may provide benefit young group patient . In addition , important objective study characterize pharmacokinetics selumetinib pediatric population since well study adult . Age Phase II : geater 2 year age less equal 18 year age . BSA great equal 0.55 ( 2 ) , able swallow whole capsule . 2 . Diagnosis : Patients NF1 inoperable PN , define PN surgically completely remove without risk substantial morbidity due encasement , close proximity , vital structure , invasiveness , high vascularity PN . The PN cause ( stratum 1 ) potential cause ( stratum 2 ) significant morbidity , ( limit ) head neck lesion could compromise airway great vessel , paraspinal lesion cause myelopathy brachial lumbar plexus lesion could cause nerve compression loss function , lesion could result major deformity ( e.g. , orbital lesion ) significantly disfigure , lesion extremity cause limb hypertrophy loss function , painful lesion . Patients enrol stratum 1 2 base PN related morbidity . Histiologic confirmation tumor necessary presence consistent clinical radiographic finding , consider malignant degeneration PN clinically suspect . A PN define neurofibroma grow along length nerve may involve multiple fascicle branch . A spinal PN involve two level connection level extend laterally along nerve . In addition PN , study subject must either positive genetic test NF1 least one diagnostic criterion NF1 list : ( NIH Consensus conference ) : Six caf ( SqrRoot ) ( Copyright ) aulait macule ( great equal 0.5cm prepubertal subject great equal 1.5 cm post pubertal subject ) Freckling axilla groin Optic glioma Two Lisch nodule A distinctive bony lesion ( dysplasia sphenoid bone dysplasia thin long bone cortex ) A firstdegree relative NF1 3 . Measurable disease : Patients must least one measurable PN , define lesion least 3 cm measure one dimension . Patients underwent surgery resection PN eligible provide PN incompletely resect measurable per criterion . 4 . Prior Therapy : Patients NF1 eligible complete tumor resection consider feasible without substantial risk morbidity , patient surgical option refuse surgery . Since standard effective chemotherapy patient NF1 PN , patient may treat trial without receive prior medical therapy direct PN .
