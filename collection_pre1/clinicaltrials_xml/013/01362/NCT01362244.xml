	<brief_title>Mepolizumab Nasal Polyposis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasal polyposis long know chronic inflammatory disease nasal mucosa . This disease characterize presence polyp upper nasal cavity , originate within ostiomeatal complex . The presence polyp cause long-term symptom prominent nasal obstruction , post-nasal drip , loss smell , discharge . These symptom impact greatly upon patient 's quality life.The etiology nasal polyposis currently unknown . The aim present study investigate use mepolizumab reduce potential need surgery subject severe bilateral nasal polyposis . The study split two part : Part A treatment phase focus reduction need surgery explore efficacy six dos mepolizumab ( one dose every four week ) nasal polyposis . This dosing regime build upon previous PoC study explore potential increased clinical efficacy assess potential need surgery , also increase duration action assess time relapse . Part B follow-up phase assess post-treatment nasal polyposis dynamic focus time relapse . All subject participate study undergo run-in period low dose intranasal steroid ( INS ) prior first dosing . INS continue throughout study study exit . This reflect real life circumstance mepolizumab intend used therapy . The overall aim study design assess impact potential need surgery explore appropriate mepolizumab therapeutic regimen strategy treatment nasal polyposis . In study , assessment nasal polyposis perform mean combine endoscopic polyp score subject report symptom . This approach reflect real-life clinical assessment nasal polyposis . Also , study incorporates condition specific general medical questionnaire order obtain good understanding impact severe nasal polyposis subject 's quality life ( QOL ) . This line increase focus medical field effect medical condition treatment quality life patient ( Fokkens et al 2007 ) .</detailed_description>
