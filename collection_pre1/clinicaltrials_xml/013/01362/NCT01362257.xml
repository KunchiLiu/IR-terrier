	<brief_summary>This two-period , open-label study conduct single site . Six healthy male subject participate study ensure least four fully evaluable subject . Each subject receive single 1000 μg ( microgram ) oral dose contain 50 μCi ( Micro Curie ) [ 14C ] -GSK573719 65 μg intravenous infusion contain 7.1 μCi [ 14C ] -GSK573719 . Whilst subject in-house , urine faecal sample collect minimum 168 hour ( 7 day ) dose 240 hour ( 10 day ) depend amount radioactivity still excrete Day 5 . Faecal sample collection may continue home 14 day . Bile sample collect use Entero-Test string sample duodenal bile . Whole blood plasma sample collect various sample time dose measure parent drug ( plasma ) total radiolabelled drug relate material ( blood plasma ) . Urine faeces aliquots take measure total radiolabelled drug-related material . Samples urine , faeces plasma transfer separate study characterize , possible , quantify metabolite matrix .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-centre , open-label , two period study healthy male subject . Each subject participate two separate dose period . In first dosing period , subject receive 65 μg single dose intravenous infusion contain 7.1 μCi [ 14C ] -GSK573719 administer 30 minute . In second dosing period , subject receive single 1000 μg oral dose contain 50 μCi [ 14C ] -GSK573719 . Each study period involve admission CRO ( clinical research organisation ) unit 7 10 day . The two dose period separate wash-out least 28 day dos . Screening occur within 30 day prior first dose period . Each subject admit clinical unit afternoon Day -1 . Whilst subject in-house , blood , urine faecal sample collect minimum 168 hour ( 7 day ) dose 240 hour ( 10 day ) , depend amount radioactivity still excrete day 5 . Liquid scintillation count ( LSC ) perform daily 24-hour urine pool 24-hour faeces homogenates Day 5 measure total radioactivity concentration . If less 1 % dose excrete 24 hour period Day 6 Day 7 give subject , subject discharge Day 8 , result LSC count available , sample collect . If excretion high 1 % , result inconclusive , subject remain in-house , urine faecal collection continue 24 hour interval , excretion le 1 % Day 8 , 9 10 ; subject discharge result LSC count available . On morning Day 11 , remain subject discharge clinic subject notify phone whether need continue faecal collection home . In event excretion still high 1 % upon discharge Day 11 , subject continue collect faecal sample , home , 24 hour interval include Day 14 . Samples collect home return clinic every 2-3 day . The Entero-Test use Treatment Period 1 ( IV dose ) . The Entero-Test insert approximately 3.5 hour pre-dose subject fast state remove approximately 2.5 hour post-dose day 1 . At approximately 0.5 hour post-dose ( i.e . two hour prior string withdrawal ) food cue use stimulate gall bladder empty . Safety data collect include spontaneous AE ( adverse event ) reporting , 12-lead ECG ( electrocardiogram ) , vital sign , nursing/physician observation safety laboratory test . Subjects complete follow assessment within 8-12 day last dose ( may happen day discharge unit ) . Final follow contact via telephone call subject 2 3 day final sample collection . The duration study approximately 11 12 week subject .</detailed_description>
