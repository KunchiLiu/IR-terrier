	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Mesothelioma Cohorts ( Cohorts 1 2 Only ) Subjects must histologically confirm epithelial biphasic mesothelioma amenable potentially curative surgical resection . However , patient biphasic tumor less equal 50 % sarcomatoid component exclude . The diagnosis confirm Laboratory Pathology / CCR / NCI . Patients must least one prior chemotherapy regimen , FDAapproved regimen platinumbased therapy combination pemetrexed preferred unless specific contraindication individual patient . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . Total Bilirubin le equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) INCLUSION CRITERIA : Lung Adenocarcinoma Cohort ( Cohort 3 ) Only Subjects must histologically confirm advanced ( Stage IIIB/IV ) lung adenocarcinoma . The diagnosis confirm Laboratory Pathology/CCR/NCI . Patients must least one prior therapy advance disease [ platinumcontaining chemotherapy one approve targeted therapy ( approve EGFR TKI EGFR mutant tumor crizotinib ceritinib ALK translocate tumor ) ] . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . Mesothelin expression least 5 % cell assess archival tumor tissue sample , determine IHC assay perform Laboratory Pathology / CCR / NCI . Archival sample must available eligibility . Total Bilirubin le equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) INCLUSION CRITERIA : Pancreatic Cancer Cohort ( Cohort 4 ) Only Subjects recurrent , locally advance unresectable metastatic adenocarcinoma pancreas . The diagnosis confirm Laboratory Pathology/CCR/NCI . Patients must least one prior chemotherapy advance disease . There limit number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . Total Bilirubin le equal 2 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) INCLUSION CRITERIA : All Subjects Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan .

The effect SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 , pentostatin , cyclophosphamide develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study therapy 3 month last dose therapy . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . While hormonal method birth control effective , ask female patient participate study cease hormonal form birth control , method birth control ( birth control pill , injection , implant ) may affect study drug . Patients must hormonal form birth control least 4 week prior initiate study . Ability comply intravenous administration schedule , ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : ( All Subjects ) Patients symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . However , patient treatment brain metastasis whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable least 46 week without steroid may enrol discretion principal investigator . Uncontrolled medical illness include , limited , ongoing uncontrolled , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( AHA Class II worse ) , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . HIV positive patient exclude due theoretical concern degree immune suppression associate treatment may result progression HIV infection . Patients Hepatitis B C exclude . Serum neutralization antibody assay show great equal 75 % neutralization SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 activity 200 ng/ml . Patients may receive investigational agent . History another invasive malignancy last two year . Adequately treated noninvasive , nonmelanoma skin cancer well situ carcinoma cervix allow . Prior treatment drug immunotoxin class . Patients tumor amenable potentially curative therapy assess investigator . Pregnant woman exclude study SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 , pentostatin , cyclophosphamide potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . The agent trial may also potentially secrete milk therefore breastfeeding woman exclude . Because potential teratogenic abortifacient effect woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method ) , study period 3 month last dose investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition SS1 ( dsFv ) PE38 .
