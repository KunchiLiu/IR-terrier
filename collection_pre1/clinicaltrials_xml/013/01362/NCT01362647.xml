	<brief_title>Postoperative Residual Curarisation Arrival Post-anesthesia Care Unit</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>• Background &amp; Rationale : Several study document neuromuscular block often persist PACU , even administration acetylcholinesterase inhibitor . Postoperative residual curarisation range 4 50 % depend diagnostic criterion , type non-depolarizing neuromuscular block drug ( NMBD ) , administration reversal agent , use neuromuscular monitoring . Residual paralysis associate postoperative complication hypoxia , weakness , respiratory failure . However , complication may many cause role neuromuscular block often unrecognized . Thus , important manage neuromuscular block strategy prevent , diagnose , treat residual paralysis , neuromuscular monitoring reversal neuromuscular block routine anesthetic practice . The data current literature residual paralysis PACU almost exclusively obtained acetylcholinesterase inhibitor reversal agent available prior introduction clinical practice sugammadex ( Bridion® ) European Union country , except USA . Reassessment practice regard relevant , sugammadex ( Bridion® ) become available country since 2009 . Five year ago similar exploratory , non-interventional , non-randomized study take place Belgium . This previous study help assess two different period ( 2005-2011 ) term management neuromuscular block operate room large regional community hospital . • Study Design : This observational/non-interventional , non-randomized study involve adult patient undergoing different type elective surgical procedure require general anesthesia NMBDs . This study reflect real life clinical practice . The anesthetic technique term drug type monitoring use entire responsibility anesthesiologist . All study activity consistent EU directive 2001/20/EC non-interventional study ( also know observational/non-interventional study ) . Administration NMBDs reversal agent ( well drug use anesthesia ) perform accordance routine anesthetic practice ; follow good clinical practice label drug . No interventional mean , method procedure schedule routine care patient . Furthermore , additional visit hospital mandatory visit schedule , deviate normal clinical practice . • Study Flowchart : On arrival PACU , 3 l/min oxygen apply subject nasal cannula . Baseline oxygen saturation value record 1 min application oxygen . Immediately patient ' arrival PACU , study nurse record tympanic temperature acceleromyographic response adductor pollicis muscle percent train-of-four ( TOF % ) stimulation ulnar nerve ( TOF-Watch® , Organon Ireland Ltd. , division MSD , Swords , Co. , Dublin , Ireland ) . The stimulus current set range 25-35 mA tolerance purpose without compromise result . Two consecutive TOF measurement ( separated 15 ) obtain , average 2 value record . If measurement differ &gt; 10 % , additional TOF measurement obtain ( 4 TOF value ) , close 2 ratio average . A TOF 90 % use cut-off value exclude residual paralysis . Pulse oximetry measure continuously throughout PACU admission , SpO2 value record 1-min interval first 30 min . PACU nurse care patient document occurrence follow event first 30 min PACU admission : number episode hypoxemia ( SpO2 &lt; 90 % ) , low SpO2 observe nursing staff , requirement either tactile verbal stimulation maintain SpO2 great 90 % , clinical evidence airway obstruction . Patient demographic data , type surgical procedure , duration anesthesia , well data collect relate neuromuscular management , record stored PC .</detailed_description>
