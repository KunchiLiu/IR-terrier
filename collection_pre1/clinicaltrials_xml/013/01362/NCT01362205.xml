The investigator hypothesize integration dexmedetomidine ( Precedex® ) usual therapy management severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( AWS ) alcohol withdrawal delirium/delirium tremens ( AWD ) critically ill adult patient reduce time resolution AWS/AWD , increase number delirium-free ventilator-free day first 28 day hospitalization , reduce length ICU hospital stay , improve neurocognitive quality life score hospital discharge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Severe alcohol withdrawal syndrome ( AWS ) alcohol withdrawal delirium ( AWD ) frequent principal indication/s admission intensive care unit . Additionally , unanticipated alcohol withdrawal complicate critical illness peri-operative state . Alcohol intoxication withdrawal syndrome characterize classic symptom adrenergic activation , psychiatric agitation include seizure , well metabolic respiratory dysfunction . The majority patient severe AWS effectively manage combination benzodiazepine ( BZD ) sedatives ( e.g . lorazepam ) butyrophenone antipsychotic ( e.g . haloperidol ) require intensive care admission 2-3 day . However , almost 25 % patient SAWS prolong critical care course , often complicate respiratory failure associate excessive sedation risk complication ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) . AWS frequently difficult manage usual care include benzodiazepine . Additionally , intermittent bolus dose sedation recommend AWS , high dose BZD alone associate excessive respiratory suppression metabolic acidosis . Such therapy increase likelihood respiratory failure attendant complication hospital acquire pneumonia sepsis . Further , patient underlie chronic liver disease great risk prolong sedative effect BZD progression hepatic encephalopathy . The requirement mechanical ventilation additionally prolongs course treatment AWD need prolong sedation . Strategies control AWS/AWD control symptom avoid adverse effect excessive respiratory suppression anticipate improve short medium-term outcome AWS . BZD infusion also show several investigator result excessive prolonged sedation . However , reasonable alternative effective control psychomotor adrenergic activation recently , unavailable . The centrally act alpha-2 receptor agonist , clonidine suggest useful adjunctive therapy BZD . However , clonidine mild sedative result significant hemodynamic compromise . By contrast , dexmedetomidine ( Precedex ) , potent alpha-2 receptor agonist , potentially effective adjunctive therapy . Precedex currently market USA short-term use potent peri-operative sedative analgesic . This agent short circulate half-life significantly few hemodynamic side effect clonidine . In addition cardiovascular property , dexmedetomidine posse anxiolytic , hypnotic/sedative , anesthetic-sparing analgesic action devoid significant respiratory depressant effect . Precedex show safe effective single agent sedative critically ill medical surgical patient prolonged infusion thirty day associate significantly low incidence delirium sedation benzodiazepine , midazolam . Preclinical experience case report suggest anecdotally Precedex may particular benefit patient SAWS . Measures sedation delirium assess Minnesota Detoxification Scale ( MINDS ) derive use critically ill adult validate Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment ( CIWA-r ) scale .</detailed_description>
