	<brief_summary>There considerable evidence Alcohol Use Disorders ( AUDs ) understand form dysregulated learning influenced classical conditioning . This base numerous study indicate condition contextual cue influence crave alcohol consumption . As result , considerable interest extinction-based treatment AUDs ( i.e. , treatment focus extinguish association alcohol cue motivation drink ) , refer cue exposure treatment To date , extinction-based treatment AUDs result disappointing outcomes clinical trial considerable interest improve form treatment . One novel strategy use pharmacological adjunct enhance extinction . Medications maximize extinction may minimize subsequent reaction alcohol cue , turn , subsequent clinical outcome . This study examine whether medication d-cycloserine ( DCS ) enhance extinction alcohol cue . Recent basic research reveal DCS enhances extinction fear cue several line evidence suggest DCS may also enhance extinction alcohol cue . Therefore , DCS may serve useful pharmacological adjunct extinction-based treatment AUDs . Our primary aim examine whether , compare placebo , DCS ( 50 mg ) enhance extinction alcohol cue control laboratory condition treatment-seeking individual alcohol use disorder . We hypothesize DCS generate great extinction compare placebo subsequent extinction session measure attenuate crave response alcohol cue . Furthermore , hypothesize DCS generate great extinction compare placebo follow-up assessment . This study proof-of-concept test whether DCS reduce reaction alcohol cue control laboratory condition . It preliminary study use subclinical number extinction session medication administration establish whether DCS improve extinction laboratory . If proof-of-concept support , suggest clinical trial warrant . A clinical sample clinical context use maximize potential generalizability exploratory study .</brief_summary>
