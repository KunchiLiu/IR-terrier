	<brief_title>Darbepoetin Alfa Patients With Anemic Low Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist 3-week screening period , 24-week double-blind treatment period , 48-week active treatment period long-term follow-up period . An end treatment period ( EOTP ) visit occur week 25 , 3 week last dose investigational product ( IP ) participant withdraw study . After enter active treatment period , end active treatment period ( EOATP ) visit occur week 72 / 73 , 3 week last dose darbepoetin alfa . Long-term follow-up ( LTFU ) occur every 26 week ( ± 4 week ) EOATP visit ( EOTP visit participant enter active treatment period ) continue minimum 3 year first dose IP . Follow-up may occur clinic visit telephone contact . Information participant 's survival progression AML status collect LTFU .</detailed_description>
