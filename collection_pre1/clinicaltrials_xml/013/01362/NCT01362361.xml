Prior treatment one line palliative standard chemotherapy colorectal cancer , prior treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor , prior palliative treatment oxaliplatincontaining regime . 4 . History malignancy last 5 year , particular could affect compliance protocol interpretation result . Patients adequately treat basal squamous cell skin cancer generally eligible . 5 . Serious concomitant disease , especially would limit compliance trial requirement consider relevant evaluation efficacy safety trial drug , neurologic , psychiatric , infectious disease active ulcer ( gastrointestinal tract , skin ) laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate trial participation trial drug administration , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry trial . 6 .
