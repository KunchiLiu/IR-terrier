	<brief_summary>The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome ( OSAS ) common disease ( 2-4 % general population ) generate intermittent hypoxemia sleep fragmentation . OSAS associate various metabolic disorder metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes . OSAS risk factor cardio-vascular disease increase morbidity/mortality . OSAS patient suffer excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) , symptom also responsible least 30 % traffic accident also cognitive disorder significant impact quality life . OSAS generate oxidative stress , inflammation resistance insulin systemic metabolic dysregulation many whose level correlate severity disease . Treatment Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) clearly demonstrate effectiveness eliminate apnea improve EDS sometimes difficult accept and/or poorly tolerate , limit effectiveness . Weight loss regular physical activity clearly recommend rarely do clinical practice . A study apply study effect rehabilitation training ( REE ) sleep apnea patient show improvement sleep quality , reduction awakening arousal sleep Index Apnea/Hypopnea ( AHI ) , methodology questionable , number patient include low . The investigator hypothesis in-patient multidisciplinary rehabilitation program comprise educational activity , dietary management individualized exercise training ( IET ) decrease OSAS severity , improve sleep quality symptom ( EDS , fatigue , QoL ) . This IET program ( 24 session 4 week ) could also help improve many metabolic dysregulation , inflammation oxidative stress ( also markers cardiovascular risk ) . Leptin , hormone involve regulate appetite , energy expenditure ventilatory control increase OSA ( mechanism leptin resistance ) . The improved sensitivity leptin may play role enable good control ventilation patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome ( OSAS ) , estimate prevalence 2 4 % ( 1 ) characterize repetitive obstruction upper airway generate intermittent hypoxemia sleep fragmentation . The typical clinical profile apneic patient middle age ( 50-55 year ) obese male , snore drowsy . Moreover , OSAS risk factor hypertension independent obesity ( 2 , 3 ) clear evidence untreated apnea patient high cardiovascular morbidity / mortality ( CVM ) high subject treat CPAP ( 4-6 ) . Clinically , excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) main symptom ( 7 ) attentional cognitive disorder ( 8.9 ) , depression simply state fatigue possible manifestation OSAS . The impact quality life ( QoL ) ( 10-12 ) significant underestimated . The origin drowsiness multiple : one find fragmentation sleep ( 13,14 ) , intermittent hypoxia , respiratory effort , obesity ( 15 ) certain cytokine TNF-alpha IL-6 involved sleep regulation ( 16-19 ) . On pathophysiology , investigator find obstructive apneic oxidative stress ( 20-24 ) systemic inflammation ( 25-27 ) . CRP level cytokine ( IL-1 beta , IL-6 , IL-8 TNF-alpha ) increase level correlate severity disease increase CVD ( 28-30 ) . Intermittent hypoxia appear play essential role genesis abnormality ( 31 ) . On metabolic dysregulation many coexist . Found abnormal fast blood glucose , state insulin resistance , dyslipidemia , hyperleptinemia . Insulin resistance increase body weight independent index apnea / hypopnea ( AHI ) ( 18 , 32-34 ) . Intermittent hypoxia appear cause . Leptin secrete adipocytes , regulates weight control appetite energy expenditure . The hyperleptinemia find OSA controversial . Obesity appear primarily responsible ( 36 ) others suggest role nocturnal hypoxemia ( 37 ) . In fact , state leptin resistance hyperleptinemia alone seem involve . Treatment continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) clearly demonstrate effectiveness suppress apneas sleep fragmentation associate . A meta-analysis ( 38 ) confirm improvement IDS PPC . However , less severe form , improve SDE le clear ( 39 ) PPC sometimes easily accept , tolerate limit effectiveness poor compliance ( 40,41 ) . From pathophysiological point view , CSF improve systemic inflammation ( 26,27 ) diminishes CVD ( 5.6 ) . For con , metabolic dysregulation ( insulin resistance , hyperleptinemia , dyslipidemia ) improve somewhat CPAP except patient without obesity ( 42-44 ) . The dietary guideline essential management disease result large part healthy lifestyle deleterious . Weight loss , regular physical activity also clearly recommend unfortunately rarely perform / support healthcare system . Few study focus study effect treatment sleep apneic patient . In normal subject , effect exercise sleep describe meta-analysis ( 45 ) . The practice regular physical activity endurance improve quality sleep ( 45-47 ) . Sleep latency shorter , less change stage fewer awakening arousal sleep . Unlike study show situation physical activity reduce ( physical inactivity , obesity , prolong bed rest , example ) sleep deteriorates , break daytime alertness decrease . The effect exercise OSAS ( 48,49 ) especially train physical exercise ( 48 ) show improvement sleep quality reduction awakening arousal sleep few respiratory event ( IAH ) . Pathophysiological point view , decrease concentration leptin ( 50-53 ) inflammatory cytokine ( 54-55 ) different population subject ( healthy , old , obese , heart failure ) . And investigator know effect exercise carbohydrate metabolism particular ( decreased insulin resistance ) . And physical activity improve sleep quality normal subject parallel would anti-inflammatory . For patient severe OSAS , hypothesis improve quality sleep ( SLP rate ) decrease AHI EDS rehabilitation training ( REE ) associate comprehensive care ( patient education , dietary , psychological , ... ) . On pathophysiology , improvement would reduction biological abnormality associate OSA also markers cardiovascular risk . Mainly metabolic disorder , oxidative stress systemic inflammation .</detailed_description>
