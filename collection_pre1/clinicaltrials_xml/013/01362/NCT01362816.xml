There also lack agreed-upon , common criterion describe main characteristic palliative care cancer population standardize tool assessment classification symptom exist . These shortcoming limit possibility design randomize controlled treatment trial palliative care ; optimal way improve clinical symptom management . To , good understand symptom evolve assess classify throughout palliative care disease trajectory important , supplemented registration treatment provide . The primary aim international research project European Palliative Care Cancer Symptom study ( EPCCS ) extend knowledge gain new insight prevalence development frequent cancer relate symptom course disease , large sample palliative care cancer patient . The clinical usefulness new assessment classification system develop European Palliative Care Research Collaborative ( EPCRC ) / European Association Palliative Care Research Network ( EAPC RN ) examine data organization delivery palliative care participate center collect . The project also aim develop consolidate international research collaboration European Palliative Care Research Centre ( PRC ) . Taken together , effort increase understand palliative disease trajectory provide necessary knowledge structure future randomize control trial ( RCTs )</brief_summary>
