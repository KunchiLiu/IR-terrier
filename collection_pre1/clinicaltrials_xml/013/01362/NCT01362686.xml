	<detailed_description>The overarch goal proposal enhance exist information technology infrastructure Central Indiana improve nation 's capacity conduct comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) . Consistent instruction RFA-HS-10-005 , investigator propose apply new capacity novel CER project evaluate treatment Alzheimer 's disease . Alzheimer 's disease identify first quartile CER priority . This proposal represent collaboration Medical Informatics Program Regenstrief Institute , Inc ( world leader health information technology ) two Indiana University research program : Center Aging Research Division Clinical Pharmacology . These program establish track record research relevant under-served population . Thus , proposal combine considerable investigator , environment , research strength continue build novel CER infrastructure support nation 's evidentiary CER priority . Throughout proposal , investigator use AHRQ definition CER : conduct synthesis research compare benefit harm different intervention strategy prevent , diagnose , treat monitor health condition real world setting . '' The investigator also refer clinical trial medication treatment behavioral symptom Alzheimer 's disease specific CER propose demonstrate potential new infrastructure . However , investigator stress enhancement propose exist infrastructure would support broad portfolio CER across array priority condition . The investigator also propose enhancement privacy confidentiality technology would allow researcher across country access de-identified data support CER . In summary , investigator propose add new CER knowledge Alzheimer ' disease thereby field test new information technology capacity important wide range CER project also increase capacity provide data opportunity nationwide CER . The derivation meaningful actionable evidence CER ultimately depend capture relevant , comprehensive accurate data treatment decision , patient ' clinical status , care process environment , health outcome experience value . Such data must track longitudinally order determine temporal relationship , cause-effect paradigm , efficacy specific clinical intervention context condition , intervention , goal care . At Indiana University Regenstrief Institute , investigator four decade experience well-documented , world-class clinical informatics research infrastructure capturing , store , query analyze treatment pattern patient ' clinical outcome . The maturation health information technology embody within Indiana Network Patient Care ( INPC ) , fully-operational regional health information exchange . The investigator well position expand leverage infrastructure support local national multi-site clinical trial comparative effectiveness . The specific aim proposal : 1.0 PROSPECT STUDY : Enhance exist information technology infrastructure : 1. provide de-identified access INPC database CER work 2. capture , store , track broad array health care outcome important patient caregiver ( e.g . behavioral symptom due dementia ) ; 3. support provider ' caregiver ' researcher ' increase need work team provide new tool communication co-management ( e.g . collaborative care research ) 2.0 COMET-AD STUDY : Conduct comparative effectiveness clinical trial medication treatment behavioral symptom Alzheimer 's disease group real-world memory care clinic enhance access Indiana Network Patient Care .</detailed_description>
