	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease widespread western world bacterial infection sepsis common complication . It show innate immune defence , represent dysfunction neutrophil granulocyte , impair chronic kidney disease . Another impact chronic kidney disease innate immunity chronic activation neutrophil lead high level inflammatory cytokine , thus contribute protein oxidation . Oxidation human serum albumin ( HSA ) , major plasma protein , occur chronic kidney disease lead activation neutrophil . Another important impact HSA oxidation decrease bind capacity lead impaired detoxification ability albumin . This include reduced clearance endotoxin , major component gram negative bacterial cell wall . Circulating endotoxin recognize complex formation lipopolysaccharide bind protein ( LBP ) follow bind CD14 toll-like receptor ( TLR ) 4 . High systemic endotoxin level occur chronic kidney disease may result decreased clearance ability HSA increase gut permeability combination intestinal bacterial overgrowth . High systemic endotoxin associate bad outcome several disease could use predictor mortality chronic kidney disease patient . Endotoxemia renal insufficiency lead impaired neutrophil function increase albumin oxidation . Oxidized albumin able bind endotoxin adequately , lead increase oxidative stress neutrophil dysfunction , result vicious cycle . 195 patient renal dysfunction enrol divide 5 group . Additionally , sample 25 age sex-matched healthy control collect . This concept change understand several aspect chronic kidney disease potentially help stratify patient different group risk accord endotoxin status , immune albumin dysfunction . The result study important implication development novel therapeutic strategy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laboratory method Endotoxin detect adapted limulus amoebocyte lysate assay . LBP sCD14 determine mean ELISA . HPLC use determine nitrate , nitrite , albumin fraction , albumin bind capacity , iNOS expression energy status neutrophil . For investigation oxidation drive leukocyte derive myeloperoxidase , mass spectrometry analysis use . Carbonyl content protein detect ELISA . Neutrophil function TLR2 , 4 9 expression study flow cytometrical analysis . For cell culture test , freshly isolate neutrophil differentiate HL60 cell use incubated albumin and/or endotoxin .</detailed_description>
