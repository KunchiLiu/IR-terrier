	<brief_summary>It current practice child surgery early onset scoliosis ( EOS ) treat insertion extendable implant know growth rod system . This allow growth potential child maximise period growth . However , child must undergo average 6 surgery lengthen rod every 6 month . Sometimes may continue several year . This require repeat general anaesthesia place patient risk complication well on-going cost hospital admission theatre episode . Magec magnetic growth rod Ellipse technology ( distribute SurgiC ) . The rod insert exactly way conventional growth rod system . The base implant i.e screw hook remain preferred choice user . The change different rod use . There several advantage device . Firstly , initial insertion , lengthening , unlike current system , need carry theatre general anaesthetic . In contrast , do outpatient set non-invasive technique . The rod lengthen use external magnetic device . The lengthening do control manner use age related growth guide . Thirdly , change theatre base intervention outpatient procedure cost-savings . The investigator also believe psychosocial benefit child family avoid stress associate repeat surgery young age . In term risk assessment device place child risk would expect insert exist system . In event failure rod worst outcome revision conventional rod .</brief_summary>
