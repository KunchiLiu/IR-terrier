	<brief_title>Barbed Suture Versus Traditional Suture Material Laparoscopic Myomectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although laparoscopic myomectomy benefit abdominal approach , less blood loss , less hemoglobin drop post-operatively , decrease post-operative pain few overall complication , difficult procedure , often require great operative time perform . In current climate attempt reduce health care expenditures , even though minimally invasive approach offer advantage reduce hospital stay , deterrent hospital administration surgeon may increase operative time may require . Barbed suture relatively new material available gynecologic surgery . Barbs cut suture barb face direction opposite needle . The barb allow anchor suture tissue , prevents migration allow suture without knot tie . This study single-centre non-blinded randomize control trial compare laparoscopic myomectomy barb suture versus traditional suture material .</detailed_description>
