	<brief_summary>The trial compare two different technique reconstruction less pelvic floor extend abdominoperineal excision locally advanced rectal cancer . The alternative reconstruction technique trial : - technique use gluteus maximus myocutaneous flap - technique use acellular porcine collagen implant The primary endpoint physical performance six month operation hypothesis technique use acellular porcine implant cause less impaired physical performance compare technique use myocutaneous flap . The study interventional , randomized definition comparative effectiveness research project .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collagen Implant Compared Gluteus Maximus Flap Reconstruction Pelvic Floor After ELAPE/EAPE Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extended abdominoperineal excision ( EAPE ) rectum potentially curative operation rectal carcinoma low primary anastomosis , especially levator sphincter musculature infiltrate . This enlarged operation , levator musculature excise en bloc rectum , create large defect . Primary closure often possible , reconstruction prosthetic material myocutaneous flap necessary avoid perineal hernia . Implantation collagen sheet show preliminary good result hand , use gluteus myocutaneous flap routine many clinic . There lack scientific evidence prove method good reconstruction lesser pelvic floor . The current study aim compare two reconstruction technique . Centres treat locally advanced rectal cancer extend abdominoperineal excision rectum ( EAPE ) [ Holm et al 2007 ] participate provide : 1. operative technique standardize accord study protocol 2. centre/unit resource examination participant physiotherapist nurse 3. centre/unit one investigator charge study locally 4. centre/unit operative volume enables least 6 patient included/randomised anticipated three year study phase inclusion Centres operate rectal cancer include study participate arrange preoperative examination physical test well follow-up patient refer centre operation . In case operate centre care randomisation , operation start postoperative rehabilitation study follow-up final rehabilitation complete patient ' primary referral hospital . The primary referral hospital need site investigator charge study patient like centre operation . Patients primary recurrent cancer rectal origin include individual patient include . Concomitant therapy allow preoperative postoperative radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy may give accord local multidisciplinary team ( MDT ) decision .</detailed_description>
