	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training Patients With End Stage Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients chronic renal failure commonly weak respiratory muscle lead problem everyday activity respiratory infection . This project aim investigate threshold inspiratory muscle train improves strength , everyday function participation patient haemodialysis . Forty eight patient recruit randomize control trial inspiratory muscle training v sham training . Outcome measure include maximal inspiratory pressure Frenchay activity index . Initial data collect blinded assessor ; patient train 40 % initial maximal inspiratory pressure six week reassess . If inspiratory muscle training effective , improve physical functional component patient 's life recommend renal patient .</detailed_description>
