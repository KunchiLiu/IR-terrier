	<brief_summary>Ceplene/IL-2 remission maintenance therapy show significantly prolong Leukemia Free Survival patient Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML ) first complete remission . This international , multicenter , open-label study evaluate effect remission maintenance therapy Ceplene/IL-2 adult patient AML CR1 specific immune system cell ( T NK cell ) prospectively define marker immune response know reflect T NK cell ability combat AML .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Maintenance Therapy With Ceplene® ( Histamine ) IL-2 Immune Response MRD Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outcome Measures : Primary : 1 . To assess quantitative qualitative pharmacodynamic effect Ceplene plus low-dose IL-2 ( Ceplene/IL-2 ) monitoring T natural killer ( NK ) cell phenotype functionality first third treatment cycle adult patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) first complete remission ( CR1 ) . 2 . To evaluate minimal residual disease ( MRD ) AML patient receive Ceplene/IL-2 . Secondary : To document , adult AML patient CR1 treat Ceplene/IL-2 : 1 . Leukemia-free survival ( LFS ) follow-up period two year . 2 . The safety Ceplene/IL-2 therapy . 3 . The potential relationship Ceplene/IL-2 effect T NK cell phenotype functionality MRD .</detailed_description>
