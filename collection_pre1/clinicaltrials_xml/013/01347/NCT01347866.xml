	<brief_summary>After fourth protocol amendment two study arm evaluate clinical protocol : PD-0325901 ( oral MEK inhibitor ) plus PF-05212384 ( intravenous PI3K/mTOR inhibitor ) PF-05212384 plus irinotecan . The study ass safety , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics combination patient advance cancer . Once maximum tolerated dos identify , assessment combination do patient previously treat metastatic colorectal pancreatic cancer PF-05212384 plus irinotecan arm patient ovarian cancer KRAS mutate non small cell lung cancer combination PF-05212384 plus PD-0325901 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histological cytological diagnosis advanced/metastatic solid tumor currently clinically effective treatment . All tumor type patient enrol Stage 1 Arm C. For patient enrolled Stage 2 Arm C , advance colorectal cancer ( KRAS mutate KRAS wild type ) , progress irinotecanbased regimen , pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma progression first line treatment metastatic/advanced disease . For patient enrolled Stage 1 Arm D , tumor KRAS BRAF mutation ( archive fresh biopsy ) . Patients tumor harbor mutation activate MAPK pathway may enrol upon agreement Sponsor . For patient enrolled Stage 2 Arm D , ovarian cancer progress prior platinum contain regimen KRAS mutate non small cell lung cancer progress one prior regimen . Patients colorectal cancer enrol Arms must : 1. receive least 6 week irinotecanbased therapy ( either single agent combination cytotoxic drug combination target therapy ) last prior treatment 2. progress within 1 month complete irinotecanbased regimen All patient must provide archive fresh tumor sample . For subset patient fresh tumor biopsy mandatory : . All patient CRC enrol Stage 2 Arm C must provide fresh tumor biopsy baseline . A subset patient ( 10 ) least 5 evaluable patient CRC KRAS wild type must also provide tumor biopsy treatment . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ( PS ) must 0 1 Adequate Bone Marrow , Renal , Cardiac , Liver Function Patients know active brain metastasis Chemotherapy , radiotherapy ( palliative radiotherapy lesion follow tumor assessment study , ie , non target lesion ) , biological investigational agent within 4 week start study treatment ( 6 week mitomycin C nitrosoureas ) . Any surgery ( include minor procedure lymph node biopsy , needle biopsy , and/or placement portacath ) within 4 week start study treatment ; fully recover side effect previous procedure . In Arm D : Patients glaucoma , intraocular pressure &gt; 21 mmHg , history retinal vein occlusion , ocular ischemia clinically significant abnormality ophthalmologic exam would make patient inappropriate entry study For patient enrol Stage 2 prior therapy agent know propose active action PI3K and/or mTOR . Prior high dose chemotherapy require hematopoietic stem cell transplantation within 12 month study treatment start . Known impaired pulmonary function demonstrate impaired Pulmonary Function Test ( PFT ) patient present clinical suggestion impairment . Uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease Current use anticipate need food drug know potent CYP3A4 inhibitor Current anticipate need food drug know potent CYP3A4 inducer</criteria>
