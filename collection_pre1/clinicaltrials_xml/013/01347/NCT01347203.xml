	<brief_title>A Healthy Volunteer Study Evaluate Single Dose 4 Different Tablets DPOC-4088 Absorption Elimination From Body Potential Effect Blood Clotting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label , single oral dose study . The 4-period crossover study determine compare PK PD profile DPOC-4088 administer single oral dose 100 mg 200 mg DPOC-4088 two prolong release formulation ( 16 20 hr ) 12 evaluable young healthy male subject . Each subject ( fast state ) receive 4 treatment ( A , B , C , D ) balance , 4-period crossover design . Each treatment consist single oral dose 100 mg 200 mg DPOC-4088 either prolong release formulation ( 16 20 hr ) . Subjects arrive study unit overnight fast least 10 hrs even dosing period remain unit least 24 hrs dose . Standard meal provide subject receive first meal dose 4 hrs post-dose . Blood sample draw PK PD evaluation immediately prior dose specified time interval 48 hrs post-dosing . Each dose period separate least 5-day washout period preferentially exceed 10 day . In healthy young male subject , safety , tolerability , PK profile DPOC-4088 assess . Additionally , study ass PD profile relationship PK/PD term ability DPOC-4088 inhibit thrombin activity ( base prolongation aPTT , ECT , TT PT ) .</detailed_description>
