	<brief_title>Irinotecan Plus E7820 Versus FOLFIRI Second-Line Therapy Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Colon Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , randomize study consist Phase Ib portion : safety run-in period 3 ascending dos E7820 ; Phase II portion : randomize 2-arm design . Approximately 95 patient measurable , nonresectable locally advanced metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma , fail first-line chemotherapy , enrol study ( approximately 12 15 patient Phase Ib portion 80 patient Phase II portion ) . Patients participate either Phase Ib Phase II portion study . Patients receive plan total 12 cycle study treatment unless occurrence progressive disease , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , withdrawal Investigator , lose follow-up , death , whichever occur first . After 12 cycle , patient demonstrate clinical benefit may continue single agent E7820 long clinical benefit sustain treatment well tolerate . If treat physician feel comfortable discontinue chemotherapy 12 cycle , chemotherapy may consider follow discussion medical monitor sponsor .</detailed_description>
