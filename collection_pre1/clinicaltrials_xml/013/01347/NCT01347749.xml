	<brief_summary>This project study whether new therapy include practice form meditation helpful combat veteran return deployment Iraq Afghanistan suffer posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . `` Mindfulness meditation '' cultivate present-focused , non-judgmental attention one body , emotion , thought , propose lead great sense well-being acceptance well tolerance painful distressing emotion . `` Compassion '' `` loving-kindness '' meditation help stabilize positive emotion like love compassion , may also helpful chronic pain , possibly depression PTSD . This study compare 16 week psychotherapy group PTSD involve Mindfulness Self-compassion meditation , standard form group psychotherapy know `` Present-centered group therapy '' . Both therapy conduct VA Ann Arbor PTSD clinic VA psychotherapist . ( The study also approve IRB VA Ann Arbor ) . Combat veteran randomly assign either Meditation standard group psychotherapy . All patient also receive fMRI brain scan therapy , well assessment interview , 8 week , immediately post-therapy , 3 mo 6 mo follow-up . Saliva cortisol measure attention also obtain assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mindfulness Present Centered Therapies PTSD : Efficacy Mechanisms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : `` Mindfulness meditation '' ancient `` Mind-Body '' attentional technique cultivate present-focused , non-judgmental attention sensory , interoceptive , emotional , cognitive process . It propose lead great sense well-being acceptance , great cognitive flexibility , good tolerance painful distress physical , emotional , cognitive phenomenon . Our group find model emotional meta-awareness lead decrease amygdala increase medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) activation . Mindfulness meditation also suggest work volitionally alter self-related cognitive/emotional processing shift away predominate 'narrative ' ( potentially ruminative ) mode 'experiential ' , present-centered mode arise sensation , percept , emotion , cognition perceive great equanimity flexibility . Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) helpful cop chronic pain , fibromyalgia , distress anxiety associate major medical disorder , Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) prevent depression relapse patient . `` Compassion meditation '' likewise ancient practice cultivate stabilize sense pro-social , empathic , kind/loving compassionate regard one 's self others , Tibetan tradition , base upon 'foundation ' mindfulness . A single small trial find loving-kindness meditation improve chronic low back pain symptom , neuroimaging study find effect emotional neurocircuitry . Objective/Hypothesis : We hypothesize practice mindfulness Tibetan self-compassion meditation PTSD patient lead 1 . ) improvement PTSD symptom quality life 2 . ) improve emotional regulation , attentional control , increase 'mindfulness ' self-compassion , 3 . ) strengthen mPFC circuit emotional provocation . There theoretical consideration limit empirical data mindfulness Tibetan compassion meditation may useful combat-related PTSD , mark exaggerated emotional response distress trauma memory cue , distress guilt self-blame , emotional dysregulation ; however , acceptability efficacy mindfulness Tibetan compassion meditation demonstrate combat PTSD . A pilot study Ann Arbor VA PTSD Clinic adapt psychotherapy use mindfulness meditation , mindful stretching exercise , Tibetan compassion meditation use combat PTSD , find significant reduction 'avoidant ' PTSD symptom self-blame cognition compare treatment-as-usual group . Importantly , also able identify obstacle acceptability provide group great insight experience acceptably effectively deliver meditation program combat veteran seek treatment PTSD . PTSD neuroimaging study implicate deficit emotional provocation medial prefrontal cortex ( mPFC ) , associate emotional regulation . Specific Aims : Aim 1 . Further develop manualized group psychotherapy base mindfulness Tibetan self-compassion meditation combat PTSD . Aim 2 . Formally test meditation intervention PTSD randomize control trial . Aim 3 . Utilizing 'translational design ' , perform pilot study fMRI neuroimaging determine effect meditation neurocircuitry underlie emotional regulation may mediate therapeutic effect Study Design : We develop manual meditation incorporate input qualitative data patient expert advisory board include meditation PTSD therapy expert . We adapt present-centered therapy group control intervention , control hour therapist contact . We randomly assign PTSD patient either meditation present-cetnered therapy , pre- post , 3 mo , 6 mo follow-up assessment validate measure PTSD psychiatric symptom , quality life , `` mindfulness '' , emotional regulation , trauma-related maladaptive cognition . We also perform pilot study fMRI neuroimaging determine effect meditation neurocircuitry underlie emotional regulation may mediate therapeutic effect . Validated emotional social cognition neuroimaging paradigm use examine specific effect mindfulness meditation mPFC cortico-limbic neurocircuitry . Impact : This research examine efficacy highly novel treatment approach PTSD , also specific neural mechanism emotional regulation may alter effortful rehearsal alternate emotion regulation emotion induction technique . It may thus lead improved treatment understand therapeutic mechanism involve emotional regulation .</detailed_description>
