	<brief_title>Improving Antiretroviral Medication Adherence Among HIV-infected Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aims : 1 . To conduct randomize controlled pilot test behavioral adherence intervention improve medication adherence among HIV-infected youth age 13-24 . Feasibility study procedure participant acceptability assess . 2 . To explore whether intervention lead improved medication adherence among youth receive intervention , compare control group youth . 40 HIV-infected adolescent recruit RCT pilot Positive STEPS intervention Fenway Health Children 's Hospital Boston . Participants randomize one two arm ( half half ) . Randomization participant occur begin week 2 study visit . The duration study 3 month Randomization : The investigator conduct block randomization base two category electronic adherence : 85 % versus &lt; 85 % . All participant exhibit non-adherence order eligible study , although may vary extent non-adherence . Because insufficient information know range non-adherence population determine valid non-adherence cut-off point , investigator may need reconsider adherence category course pilot study . The investigator regularly examine data determine whether finer adherence category need , investigator adjust category determination make . Intervention arm : - Participants receive one one Positive STEPS counseling session ( ~1 hour session per week 5 week ) . - Participants receive motivational reminder take medication send via text message cell phone - Participants receive Medication Event Monitoring Systems ( MEMS ) pill cap monitoring device measure antiretroviral medication adherence . Comparison condition arm : • Participants receive Medication Event Monitoring Systems ( MEMS ) pill cap monitoring device measure antiretroviral medication adherence .</detailed_description>
