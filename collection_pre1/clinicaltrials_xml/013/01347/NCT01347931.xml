	<brief_summary>The Breathe NIOVâ„¢ System reduce work breathe subject chronic respiratory insufficiency require long-term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) . The Breathe system accomplish provide oxygen pressure augment subject 's spontaneous tidal volume . The combination efficient oxygen delivery , assist ventilation , comfortable low-profile device , result mean improvement perceive well-being ability perform ADLs , measure patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) instrument .</brief_summary>
