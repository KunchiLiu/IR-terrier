	<brief_summary>The aim study ( ) Determine tumor hypoxia accurately visualise [ 18F ] HX4 PET image head neck tumor ( ii ) correlate [ 18F ] HX4 PET image blood tissue marker ( iii ) investigate quality optimal timing [ 18F ] HX4 PET imaging ( iv ) compare [ 18F ] HX4 PET uptake [ 18F ] FDG PET uptake treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET With 18FHX4 Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tumor hypoxia situation tumor cell deprive oxygen . Hypoxic tumor cell usually resistant radiotherapy chemotherapy likely develop metastasis . In head neck cancer , tumor hypoxia know important prognostic factor long term survival . [ 18F ] HX4 develop diagnostic radiopharmaceutical PET image find marker hypoxia use standard clinical practice . Current hypoxia tracer lack reliable image quality kinetics . Because short half life clearance , expect [ 18F ] HX4 high tumor background ratio current nitro-imidazole hypoxia marker [ 18F ] -misonidazole . The clinical use reliable , non-invasive easy use hypoxia image agent could allow selection patient likely benefit hypoxia modify therapy . Included eligible patient head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( T2 , T3 , T4 , N , M0 ) tumor diameter ≥ 2,5 cm oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx larynx , plan treat curative primary radiation treatment ( +/- concurrent chemotherapy ) . Before treatment standard planning [ 18F ] FDG PET-CT perform , blood sample drawn baseline [ 18F ] HX4 PET scan perform . 18F-HX4 scan repeat radiotherapy treatment 20 +/- 4 Gy ( approximately two week ) . Three month end treatment [ 18F ] FDG PET scan perform .</detailed_description>
