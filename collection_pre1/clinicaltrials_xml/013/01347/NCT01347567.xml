	<brief_title>Heart Failure ( HF ) Outpatient Monitoring Evaluation ( HOME ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systolic dysfunction heart failure subject low ejection fraction elevate BNP level admit hospital treat outpatient decompensated Heart Failure ( HF ) hight risk recurrent decompensation readmission . The objective study investigate patient may benefit enhance home monitoring HF status . In 3 study arm ( BNP , Health Management control group ) home fingerstick BNP level obtain frequent data point available analysis trend variability . These result remain blinded subject study arm care providers health management control arm , investigator staff access BNP result subject BNP arm use information aid therapy decision . Subjects monitor 180 day time period likely sufficient differentiate normal biological variation BNP change due impend decompensation . Patients assess Day 30,90 180 randomization HF status , patient clinical outcome treatment adjustment record . Follow-up telephone call subject 3 6 month completion home testing conduct order determine possible long-term benefit home health management daily BNP testing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Adults ( 18 year age &lt; 75 year age ) ; AND 2 . Admitted hospital treat outpatient clinic diagnosis decompensated HF treatment administer ; i. BNP &gt; 300 pg/mL ( NTproBNP &gt; 1500 pg/mL ) hospital admission clinic visit . OR c. Seen outpatient set ( i.e . heart failure clinic , general practice cardiology office , urgent care unit ) document history HF sign worsen HF condition decompensation , worsen HF condition define one following ; . Increase NYHA class worsening symptom ( i.e . dyspnea , fatigue ) level activity ii . Symptoms require change dosage one follow medication : 1. diuretic 2. beta blocker 3 . ACE inhibitor iii . Physical evaluation consistent worsen HF sign ( i.e . elevate JVP , ankle edema , dyspnea , abdominal distension , &gt; 4 lb &gt; 1.8 kg weight increase past week ) iv . HF admission last 30 day document BNP &gt; 300 pg/mL ( NTproBNP &gt; 1500 pg/mL ) since admission AND d. Presence leave ventricular systolic dysfunction ( ejection fraction &lt; 40 % ) ; e. Successfully train deem proficient perform fingerstick use Test System . Each subject undergo two proficiency assessment . . The first assessment perform time subject find meet inclusion criterion , deem willing , able reliable complete study task , follow initial training use test system . Successful completion first proficiency assessment result enrolment subject study . The second assessment perform follow one week ( 7 day Â± 2 day ) home test demonstrate retention training . Successful completion second proficiency assessment result randomization subject one three study arm study . Failure demonstrate proficiency second assessment result withdrawal subject study . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Unwilling unable provide write informed consent ; 2 . Acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) primary diagnosis ; secondary diagnosis concomitant primary diagnosis decompensated HF treatment provide . Note : A history ACS cause exclusion concomitant present decompensated HF admission make . Small elevation cardiac troponin consider treat physician associate myocardial injury due acute decompensated HF due concomitant ACS myocardial infarction basis exclusion . 3 . Previous cardiac transplantation cardiac transplantation anticipate within 3 month ; 4 . Current plan use leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) , use outpatient intravenous inotropic HF therapy , major surgical procedure percutaneous coronary intervention within 3 month ; 5 . Life expectancy le 6 month due cause HF cardiovascular disease ( e.g. , cancer ) ; 6 . End stage renal disease ( dialysis dependency ) ; 7 . Receiving investigational medication ; 8 . Hematocrit outside 25 50 % range HeartCheck system ; 9 . Prisoner institutionalize vulnerable individual ; 10 . Dementia , tremor impediment perform daily home BNP test via fingerstick ( unless BNP test conduct qualified caregiver ) ; 11 . Deemed investigator likely comply studymandated procedure instruction ; 12 . Residence region either transmission test system data home visit possible .</criteria>
