	<brief_summary>The goal study determine off-pump CABG surgery associate well cerebral tissue oxygenation compare on-pump CABG . In addition , investigator would like compare result two different monitor brain tissue oxygenation , assess correlation brain tissue oxygenation oxygenation measurement renal muscular tissue , well conventional hemodynamic metabolic variable , central venous oxygen saturation ( ScvO2 ) . Finally , investigator aim determine duration extent cerebral oxygen desaturation predict outcome variable postoperative cognitive performance .</brief_summary>
