	<detailed_description>Amyloidosis systemic disease usually result misfolded protein form amorphous fibrillar material various tissue cause progressive dysfunction . The prevalence amyloidosis varies depend population concern type amyloid . While prevalence general population unknown , accord estimate Mayo Clinic prevalence 1 90 666 % U.S . In England disease generate 0.0084 % ( 1367 / 16232579 ) hospital visit April 2008 April 2009 . The common clinical manifestation include cardiac disease , renal liver function , may vary widely depend type amyloidosis , organ infected extent deposit . Amyloid infiltration produce sign symptom may similar rheumatic disease . This may suggest potential clinical polymorphic underdiagnosis due low clinical suspicion . The registry organize system systematic data collection large number patient quickly efficiently particular disease give time . The main difficulty registry guarantee quality data . The main objective registry : 1 . Understand risk factor prognosis . 2 . Evaluate diagnostic therapeutic comparison current standard . 3 . Advance knowledge disease optimize assessment , treatment monitoring patient . 4 . Analyze effectiveness new therapy . 5 . Studying difference population . 6 . Quickly estimate morbidity , mortality resource utilization associate disease entity . 7 . Examine course disease 8 . Formulate novel hypothesis prospective study . Currently , registry patient transthyretin amyloidosis ( TAHOS ) , global registry transplant patient familial amyloid poly neuropathy . Also , indirect registry kidney transplant , heart transplant , among others . The investigator find data prevalence incidence , evolution prognosis amyloidosis country . There exist record national Amyloidosis Latin America could describe behavior disease environment . Because chronic disease amyloid infiltration produce sign symptom may similar rheumatic disease , clinic potentially poliform , may suggest underestimation low clinical suspicion . As cure , patient may persist symptomatic despite adequate therapy , important creation monitoring system generate data evolution prognosis . The data registry use develop new treatment guideline recommendation , also inform educate physician management disease . The Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires center high complexity derivation type pathology due fact hospital , private health insurance system ( HIBA 's health plan [ plan de salud , PS ] , give unique opportunity denominator generation population affiliate , therefore investigator propose make Institutional Registry Amyloidosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 year : Confirmed amyloidosis : • Proof deposit amyloid pathology tissue biopsy abdominal fat , bone marrow , rectum organ involve ( eg , kidney , liver , sural nerve ) Clinically compatible unconfirmed case Amyloidosis : Cardiology : The presence 2 point : Right heart failure and/or leave ECG : QRS voltage decrease Echocardiogram : thickness increase hyperrefraction ventricular wall , increase interatrial septum thickness . With clear cause increase ventricular thickness ( hypertension , valvular heart disease ) Cardiac MRI : diffuse subendocardial increase gadolinium uptake delay image . Renal : • Renal involvement serum free lambda chain Other : Evidence clonal proliferation plasma cell . This include monoclonal protein serum/urinary , plasma cell bone marrow , abnormal relationship serum light chain without evidence amyloid deposit compose fragment light chain immunofluorescence immunohistochemistry , lambda kappa blood relatives patient confirm familial amyloidosis present clinical feature poly neuropathy without alternative cause gene mutation confirm amyloidogenic protein Refusal participate study informed consent process patient legal representative refusal consent participate study case minor .</criteria>
