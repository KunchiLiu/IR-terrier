	<brief_title>Preoperative Magnetic Resonance ( MR ) Imaging Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : During last two decade , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) prostate evolve become promising tool preoperative evaluation prostate cancer . Several study evaluate radiological histopathological correlation . However , sensitivity specificity regard stag show wide range poor reproducibility . These discrepancy explain difference patient selection , MRI method , criterion use diagnosis . More study therefore need evaluate clinical impact preoperative MRI patient prostate cancer . Aims study : To evaluate 1 ) detection rate tumor 1-3 ( tumor 1 = index tumor ) , size tumor 1-3 , possible extraprostatic extension predict presence Gleason grade 4 5 tumor , 2 ) influence preoperative MRI surgical decision process respect operative procedure removal gland pelvic lymph node dissection , 3 ) impact preoperative MRI rate positive surgical margin functional result . Material method : A prospective study include 400 consecutive patient refer robot assist laparoscopic prostatectomy randomise preoperative MRI ( intervention group ) MRI ( control group ) . The prostatectomy specimens histopathologically examine , TNM classification perform accord 2002 AJCC standard .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion All patient suitable surgery . Positive biopsy ( Gleason grade &gt; 3 ) . Informed consent . Patients sign consent paper reason accept study premise . Patents want withdraw reason study . Patients contraindication MRI ( pacemaker , claustrophobia etc ) and/or surgery . Patients undergone high quality MRI examination prostate another radiological center . In situation MR examination evaluate together surgeon patient include study . ( In case low quality examination , disregard finding , include patient ) . If surgeon find unacceptable perform RALP without MRI , various reason ( eg . patient demand , high risk etc ) patient include study . If preoperative MRI reveals extensive tumor invasion adjacent organ ( T4 ) skeletal metastasis ( M1 ) , cancer stadium benefit RALP .</criteria>
