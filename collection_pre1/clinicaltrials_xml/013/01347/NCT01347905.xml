	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate weight loss , particular due adipose tissue loss , obese patient reverse obesity-related reduction iron absorption , due decrease hepcidin concentration . Additionally , investigator investigate change iron incorporation erythrocyte due reduction iron sequestration adipose tissue reticuloendothelial system . The investigator expect decrease adiposity , circulate hepcidin level decrease , iron absorption incorporation erythrocytes increase result iron status improve .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changes Iron Absorption Availability Before After Weight Loss Obese Pre-menopausal Women Men .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Until adiposity associate low iron status high hepcidin level . Moreover , weight loss thereby loss fat mass , associate decrease hepcidin level improve iron status . However , direct measure iron absorption incorporation erythrocyte assess lose weight/fat mass . We hypothesize : - body fat loss obese woman men improve iron absorption , correct iron status , label test meal measure use stable isotope technique average 30 % . - body fat loss obese woman men decrease relate inflammatory state . - great subclinical inflammation obese woman men correlate decreased incorporation iron erythrocyte , improve loss body fat . The study prospective cohort iron bioavailability assess obese woman men weight loss associate loss body fat period 6 month . Iron absorption estimate use stable-isotope technique incorporation 57Fe 58Fe erythrocyte measure 14 day administration . Preparation isotopically label iron do Laboratory Human Nutrition Swiss Federal Institute Technology Zurich ( ETH Zürich ) . A baseline venous blood sample draw 6-8 week surgery surgery-related inflammation resolve . The subject receive test drink , contain 6 mg 57Fe label ferrous sulphate . One hour later , 2 ml aqueous solution contain 100 μg 58Fe iron citrate 250 cc normal saline infuse 50 min . This infusion protocol use safely successfully examine iron metabolism adult infant . Fourteen day later , second venous blood sample drawn . This procedure perform baseline ( 6-8 week post-surgery ) end study ( 6 month post baseline ) . Our study could provide important information establish mechanism obesity-mediated inflammation could induce iron deficiency . This first human trial evaluate obesity-related reduction iron absorption reversible context obesity iron deficiency highly prevalent .</detailed_description>
