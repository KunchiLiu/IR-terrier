Following surgery ( Day 0 ) , subject randomly assign receive intranasal ketorolac 30 mg intranasal placebo pain intensity ( PI ) rating equal least 40 mm 100-mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Subjects receive study drug every 8 hour 48 hour 3 time daily 5 calendar day total ; frequency dosing could reduce 48 hour . Starting time first dose study drug continue first 48 hour surgery , subject access morphine sulfate ( MS ) administer via patient control analgesia ( PCA ) . After PCA longer require , backup pain relief provide another standard nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( non-NSAID ) analgesic regimen .
