	<brief_title>Vismodegib After Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With High-Risk First Remission Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine GDC-0449 ( vismodegib ) able reduce myeloma cancer stem cell ( CSC ) give patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) follow autologous stem cell transplantation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether GDC-0449 inhibit hedgehog ( Hh ) pathway patient MM follow autologous transplantation measure downstream target Hh use quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) plasma cell MM CSC obtain blood bone marrow patient undergoing treatment . II . To determine whether change MM CSC measure clonogenic assay bone marrow see response GDC-0449 whether change predict recurrence . III . To determine whether change MM CSC measure similar well accuracy use peripheral blood flow cytometry compare bone marrow clonogenic assay . IV . To determine safety toxicity profile treatment GDC-0449 follow autologous transplantation patient high risk relapse MM . V. To characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) GDC-0449 ( total unbound ) steady-state correlate pharmacodynamic ( PD ) endpoint . VI . To determine one year progression free survival patient give GDC-0449 follow autologous transplantation . OUTLINE : Patients receive vismodegib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 11 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
