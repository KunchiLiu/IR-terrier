	<brief_title>Deficits Emotion Regulation Skills Maintaining Factor Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research suggest deficits general emotion regulation skill ( GEMS ; e.g. , ability aware , understand , accept , tolerate modify negative emotion ) help maintain symptoms depression , well mental disorder often co-occurring depression . Therefore , systematically target deficit hypothesize enhance efficacy efficiency current treatment severe highly prevalent disorder . However , point lack prospective study investigate causal effect broad range potentially relevant GEMS depression , evaluate effect systematically enhance skill specific intervention , investigate whether level comorbid symptom load moderate importance GEMS depression . Therefore , assess GEMS , depressive symptom severity ( DSS ) comorbid symptom load 150 individual seek treatment major depressive disorder ( MDD ) across multiple assessment point , clarify causal pathway GEMS DSS . Nested within longitudinal design , prior individual cognitive behavioral therapy depression ( iCBT-D ) participant randomly assign either ( ) group-based training GEMS ( ART = affect regulation training ; Berking , 2010 ) , ( b ) active treatment condition design control unspecific effect psychotherapeutic intervention ( i.e. , common-factor-based-treatment control condition , CFT-C ) , ( c ) wait-list-control condition ( WLC ) . Potential effect systematically enhance GEMS DSS assess 8-week pre-iCBT-D interval ( stand-alone effect ) first four month subsequent iCBT-D ( augmentation effect ) . Assessment include retrospective self-ratings , observer-based rating , ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) . Thus , addition provide important information relevance GEMS maintenance depression , study help evaluate different methodological approach identify deficit GEMS .</detailed_description>
