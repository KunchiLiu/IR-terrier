	<detailed_description>Individuals intermediate risk account large proportion patient present atherosclerotic event . The barrier reduce problem relate expense unselective primary prevention strategy among group majority event , well difficulty get apparently well subject adhere lifestyle pharmacologic management . An outcome-based study would require large number would unlikely fund without proof concept . CIMT use validated surrogate atherosclerotic status future cardiovascular event study . As , study use CIMT ( delineator risk primary endpoint ) , marker atherosclerotic burden ( disease process rather surrogate ) , address unresolved issue efficiently manage intermediate risk subject family history premature atherosclerosis combine good selection individual active treatment recommend lifestyle change DMP strategy optimise successful application longer-term . The Intima-Media thickness guidance Primary prevention Relatives individual Early onSet atherosclerosiS ( IMPRESS ) Study test follow null hypothesis : In intermediate risk , first-degree relative ( i.e . mother , father , brother sister ) individual premature atherosclerosis , CIMT-targeted DMP primary prevention ( IMPRESS intervention ) incorporate intensive non-pharmacological pharmacological management , provide good reduction atherosclerotic burden ( determined change CIMT baseline follow-up completion ) usual health care management three year follow-up . Study Design The study hypothesis examine via randomise control primary prevention/intervention trial compare individualised DMP usual clinical care middle-aged ( 40-65 year old ) subject family history premature cardiovascular disease determine intermediate risk cardiovascular event within next 5 years7 , 22 . Study Centres As multicentre study , participant recruit three centre : - Princess Alexandra Hospital ( Brisbane , Australia ) : responsible site investigator Associate Professor Karam Kostner - Baker IDI Heart Diabetes Institute/ The Alfred Hospital ( Melbourne , Australia ) : responsible site investigator Dr Melinda Carrington - National University Health System Novena Heart Centre ( Singapore ) : responsible site investigator Professor Desley Hegney Participants This study conduct group 40-65 year old adult . IMPRESS Study test follow null hypothesis : In intermediate risk , first-degree relative ( i.e . mother , father , brother sister ) individual premature atherosclerosis , CIMT-targeted DMP primary prevention ( IMPRESS intervention ) incorporate intensive non-pharmacological pharmacological management , provide good reduction atherosclerotic burden ( determined change CIMT baseline follow-up completion ) usual health care management three year follow-up . Primary End-Point Consistent study hypothesis , primary study end-point change CIMT baseline three year , determine blind core laboratory analyse intention-to-treat basis accord random study group allocation . Secondary End-Points The secondary endpoint change baseline three year follow variable : ) Plaque length ( carotid artery ) ii ) Internal CIMT iii ) General health well ( measure SF-12 18 EQ-5D 19 ) iv ) Mental health ( determine Arrol 20 +/- CESD 21 ) v ) Health care cost vi ) Modifiable risk factor atherosclerotic disease diabetes ( i.e . smoking , dyslipidaemia , obesity hypertension ) vii ) Absolute cardiovascular risk profile 22 risk diabetes ( determine Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool [ AUSDRISK ] ) Score 23 ) viii ) Diabetic status ( determine fast glucose ) ix ) All-cause mortality/ cardiovascular hospitalisation</detailed_description>
