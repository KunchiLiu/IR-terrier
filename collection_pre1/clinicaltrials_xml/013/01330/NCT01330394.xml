	<brief_summary>Alcohol dependency frequent addiction lead massive burden , patient health , economy . Present therapeutic concept suffer limited efficacy , thus new innovative therapy need . Neuroscientific study show prefrontal function alcohol-dependent patient impair , lead cognitive disturbance , continuation dependent behaviour . The result pilot study demonstrate activation prefrontal cortex via non-invasive brain stimulation improve cognitive performance healthy subject , diminish dependency-related behaviour patient . The investigator aim develop stimulation protocol suit induce clinically relevant improvement prefrontal function patient suffer alcohol dependency . Therefore , investigator develop stimulation protocol able modulate prefrontal activation much long time course currently available , explore induced physiological alteration translate respective cognitive improvement reduction addictive behaviour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Over Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex Alcoholism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A hallmark alcoholism deficiency frontal lobe , characterize deficit attention work memory executive dysfunction . This condition especially marked inability abstain alcohol , direct implication treatment alcoholism ( Goldstein Volkow 2002 ) . In previous study , examine frontal function Frontal Assessment Battery ( FAB ) mental state Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) 170 patient alcoholism classify accord Lesch 's typology ( Zago-Gomes Nakamura- Palacios 2009 ) . In global analysis , alcoholic show total score MMSE FAB significantly small compare non-alcoholics subject . Type IV alcoholic show low score MMSE FAB comparison non-alcoholics type ( Lesch 's type I , II III ) alcoholic . In specific analysis , even alcoholic Type IV mental function ( MMSE ) preserve , executive function ( FAB ) significantly reduce ( Zago-Gomes Nakamura-Palacios 2009 ) . Moselhy et al . ( 2001 ) suggest frontal cognitive deficit observe alcoholic patient important predictor therapeutic result . According Lesch et al ( 1989 , 1990 , personal communication ) , Type IV alcoholic , show severe frontal deficit one worst prognosis , great difficulty abstain alcohol , still treatable intensive multiple approach . Therefore , investigation new perspective treatment alcoholic especially need . A technique neuromodulation increasingly use test transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) . In method , weak direct current induced cerebral cortex two electrode usually place scalp ( Nitsche et al 2008 ) . Several study show noninvasive method brain stimulation associate significant change cortical excitability - increase decrease accord polarity stimulation ( Nitsche Paulus 2000 , Nitsche Paulus 2001 ; Zaghi et al 2009 ) . Animal study 50 60 show effect tDCS associate change threshold neuronal membrane rest ( Bindman et al 1964b ; Purpura McMurtry 1965 ) . There evidence anodal transcranial stimulation improve cognitive function man , effect seem due strengthen glutamatergic synapsis ( Fregni et al 2005 , Iyer et al 2005 , Nitsche et al 2003 ) . In recent study examine clinical electrophysiological ( indicated P3 component ) effect tDCS application leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) different type alcoholic accord Lesch 's typology ( data submit publication ) . We enrol 49 alcoholic age 18 75 year old subacute period abstinence . These individual submit event-related potential ( ERP ) presentation sound related non-related use alcohol , active tDCS ( 1mA , 35 cm2 , 10 minute ) sham procedure randomize counterbalanced order . We observe significant improvement FAB performance active tDCS compare sham Type IV alcoholic . There increase amplitude P3 mainly frontal site ( Fz ) . This change also pronounce Type IV alcoholic . Thus , find clinical electrophysiological evidence increase frontal activity induce tDCS specific type IV alcoholic . Considering frontal dysfunction , may contribute loss control drink behavior , result suggest local increase frontal activity induce tDCS may beneficial clinical impact . Therefore , project intend continue study , aim investigate potential beneficial effect tDCS apply repeatedly ( week 5 consecutive week ) leave DLPFC treatment alcoholism course protract withdrawal . The frontal function examine application FAB cognitive test . A clinical follow-up carefully conduct . General objective : The main objective study examine potential beneficial effect repetitive transcranial direct current electrical stimulation leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex treatment alcoholism course protract withdrawal . Specific objective : Of specific objective include verification effect repetitive transcranial electrical stimulation ( 5 application ) : ( 1 ) record event-related potential 32 brain region , ( 2 ) craving , ( 3 ) performance frontal assessment battery , ( 4 ) performance two-back visual-spatial work memory task , ( 5 ) performance two-back auditory work memory task , ( 6 ) performance inhibitory control behavior Go / No-Go task , ( 7 ) performance error detection , mental flexibility inhibitory control count Stroop test , ( 8 ) quality life . This study recruit thirty three alcoholic diagnosis confirm Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) present voluntarily treatment Alcohol Dependence Syndrome outpatient public service University Hospital Cassiano Antonio de Moraes Health Sciences Center Federal University Espirito Santo ( PAA / HUCAM / CCS / UFES ) , clinically stable require hospitalization , significant history consumption least 35 weekly dos alcohol average last year , active intake least 35 weekly dos alcohol last 90 day start study , yet , minimum seven day abstinence begin study protocol . They sign consent form distribute randomly two group ( sham tDCS group ) . Registrations visual-cued ( neutral alcohol-related image ) event-related potential ( ERPs ) do repetitive bilateral ( left cathodal/right anodal ) transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS , 5 x 7 cm2 , 2 mA , double application - 13 min duration 20 min interval ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex sham procedure . tDCS sham tDCS apply day 5 consecutive day . Cognitive test ( frontal assessment battery - FAB , mini-mental status examination - MMSE , verbal n-back task , visuospatial n-back task , go/no-go task ) do begin session 1 session 6 . They weekly follow 4 additional week monthly follow 5 month . Treatment acute withdrawal follow routine outpatient service ( diazepam , vitamins general support ) . They examine weekly outpatient service 4 week end protocol .</detailed_description>
