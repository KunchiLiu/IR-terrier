	<brief_summary>Although low prevalence , aggressive periodontitis rapid destructive form periodontal disease initiate young age , leading premature loss first molars incisor . Little known mechanism disease . It imperative understand mechanism disease establish proper treatment . We establish control study comparable population present similar aggressive disease characteristic evaluate mechanisms disease . It goal study determine immunological microbiological mechanism responsible rapid tissue destruction child localize aggressive periodontitis traditional periodontal intervention affect mechanisms . Important knowledge gain proposal aid define specific treatment approach well control disease progression prevent disease initiation susceptible individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There multiple appointment throughout study vary depend upon patient disease present . If patient gum disease : At initial examination , sample collect : natural fluid come gum bacteria present collect insert piece paper filter strip space teeth gum ; blood sample may also take phlebotomist evaluate inflammatory sign disease possible genetic marker ( 5 teaspoon visit ) ; cheek swab may take gently rub little brush inside cheek . Patients also may ask spit container provide . Tissues gum usually discard may also collect treatment . When patient return re-evaluation gum , sample may collect 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month initial therapy . After 24 month , clinical examination may perform , 3 visit within follow 3 year . If patient gum disease : If gum healthy patient need treatment , see every 6 month examination cleaning , sample collection may also take visit 24 month . These sample collection do studied genetic test , tell u specific genetic marker ( inherited marker ) associate disease , also laboratory testing , help researcher identify body respond bacteria . These marker also evaluate family member ( parent , grandparent sibling ) , possible , check likelihood member develop disease . Regardless patient 's gum condition , investigator also evaluate current past dental x-rays determine sign disease past . Investigators may also take photo teeth gum .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion child/adolescent : Male female , age 5 25 In good general health evidence medical history Diagnosed localized aggressive periodontitis ( LAP ) , define presence attachment loss ≥ 2mm detected bone loss least two site , involve first molar and/or incisor , Periodontally healthy ( defined absence clinical sign periodontitis ) relate LAP participant Inclusion parent /grandparent : Male female , age 90 year Parent grandparent enrol participant LAP Exclusion child/adolescent : Diagnosed systemic disease condition could influence progression and/or clinical characteristic periodontal disease ( i.e. , immunosuppression , diabetes , neutropenia blood disorder ) . Patients take antibiotic within last 3 months* require antibiotic prophylaxis prior initial visit . Patients currently take medication could influence characteristic response periodontal treatment ( example : immunesuppressive drug , cyclosporine steroid ) . Smokers ( ≥10 cigarette day 6 month ) Pregnant/lactating woman pregnancy cause gingival change could confound study result . Any psychiatric condition inhibit participant proper understand study procedure determine PI/clinician investigator . patient may still enroll scheduled initial visit 3 month later Exclusion parent/grandparent : Patients take antibiotic within last 3 months* require antibiotic prophylaxis prior initial visit . Pregnant/lactating woman pregnancy cause gingival change could confound study result . Any psychiatric condition inhibit participant proper understand study procedure determine PI/clinician investigator .</criteria>
