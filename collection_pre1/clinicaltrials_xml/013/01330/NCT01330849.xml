The second type intervention focus academic target manipulate academic instruction material ( i.e. , reduce task length , peer tutor ) . In current proposal investigator focus first category . Pelham &amp; Fabiano ( 2008 ) recently conclude `` evidence BCM [ behavioural classroom management ] ADHD substantial '' . However , considerable evidence base value classroom management component ADHD treatment multi-modal psychosocial treatment package school-aged child , lack well design randomize study naturalistic school set provide definitive estimate efficacy approach . At University Hospital Leuven toolkit school behaviour modification child ADHD develop pilot . This instrument teachers systematically target specific behaviour classroom playground ultimate goal improve school ADHD behaviours reduce oppositionality . Teachers identify behaviour challenge apply series level intervention increase intensity monitoring , feedback training . The effect three month application toolkit evaluate compare wait list control group . Outcome measure include measure ADHD behaviour , oppositional defiant behaviour , teacher attitude towards ADHD , teacher-child relationship child self-esteem .</detailed_description>
