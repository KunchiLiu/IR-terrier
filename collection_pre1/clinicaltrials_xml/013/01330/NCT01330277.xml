	<brief_summary>Hunter Syndrome ( mucopolysaccharidosis II [ MPS II ] ) lysosomal storage disorder cause reduction absence iduronate-2-sulphatase enzyme still problem difficulty simple reliable analysis primary diagnosis also follow-up disease . Especially case female carrier report symptom MPS II due skew X-inactivation make diagnosis complex . However , early diagnosis treatment disease complication enzyme replacement therapy improve quality life.Therefore primary aim project call `` BioHunt '' development new plasma biomarker early sensitive diagnosis disease . The secondary aim test clinical robustness , specificity long-term stability biomarker.Within scope study investigator would like collect next 12 month 80 patient 's plasma parallel simple documentation clinical data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hunter disease ( mucopolysaccharidosis type II ) lysosomal storage disease cause deficiency enzyme iduronate-2-sulphatase . Deficiency iduronate sulphatase enzyme cause accumulation product dermatan sulphate heparan sulphate lysosome lead cell death . Hunter disease vary mild severe , depend level enzyme deficiency . Features disease include dwarfism , enlarge liver spleen , cardiovascular disorder deafness . Mutations IDS gene locate Xq28 cause loss iduronidate sulfatase enzyme . A pseudogene IDS2 also exist 20 kb active IDS gene . The pseudogene IDS2 share homology exon 2 , intron 2 , exon 3 , intron 3 intron 7 IDS gene . Mutations report IDS gene Hunter patient include gene rearrangement cause recombination IDS2 gene ( 10 per cent patient ) , deletion certain exon entire IDS gene ( 10 per cent patient ) small mutation include insertion , deletion point mutation ( 80 per cent patient ) . To detect possible type mutation IDS gene cause Hunter disease , three procedure necessary . These include Southern blot look gene rearrangement , multiplex dosage analysis detect large deletion DHPLC sequence detect small mutation . An accurate biochemical test available diagnosis Hunter disease consist analysis iduronate-2-sulfatase activity plasma , leucocytes cultured cell . This test consider molecular analysis undertaken . Molecular identification mutation individual confirm diagnosis use carrier test prenatal diagnosis family . The biochemical test reliable identifying carrier .</detailed_description>
