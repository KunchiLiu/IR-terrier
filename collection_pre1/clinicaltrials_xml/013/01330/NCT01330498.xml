	<detailed_description>Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) relate utilization Tysabri therapeutic agent treatment multiple sclerosis . The etiologic agent human polyomavirus JC . PML result lytic infection glial cell via mutant JC virus multiple sclerosis patient actively treat Tysabri . The mutated JC virus neurotrophic virus infects human . `` The regulatory region sequence JC virus hypervariable contain determinant neurotropism neurovirulence . '' ( Jensen Major , 2001 ) . In patient initially infected part childhood virus tend remain quiescent kidney , bone marrow lymphoid tissue . The true incidence JC virus seroprevalance currently assess via two Biogen Idec clinical trial ( STRATIFY 1 101JC401 STRATIFY 2 101JC402 ) . Application make FDA regard label change Tysabri incorporate use JC antibody assay . Upon FDA approval label change , JC assay serve primary risk stratification tool clinical use Tysabri . Secondary tertiary risk stratification marker would greatly aid clinical management patient JC antibody positive .</detailed_description>
