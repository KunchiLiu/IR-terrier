	<brief_title>Non-invasive Ventilation System Moderate-to-Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate Breathe Technologies Ventilator System regard subject acceptability , comfort , effect exercise activity daily live tolerance . Primary Hypothesis : 1 . When use Breathe Technologies Ventilation System simulated activity daily live ( ADL ) , Subjects moderate-to-severe COPD comfortable report acceptability . Secondary Hypotheses : 2 . When use Breathe Technologies Ventilation System simulate ADLs , Subjects moderate-to-severe COPD experience tolerable dyspnea measure use Borg Dyspnea Score ( BDS ) visual analog Comfort Scale ( VACS ) . 3 . Subjects prefer use Breathe Technologies Ventilation System standard oxygen therapy exertion ADLs use ventilator therapy five day .</detailed_description>
