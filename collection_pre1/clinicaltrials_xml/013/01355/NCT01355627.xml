	<brief_summary>The primary objective demonstrate superiority TachoSil® compare current practice adjunct seal dura mater . The efficacy dura mater seal must evaluate post-operatively . The secondary objective evaluate safety TachoSil® adjunct seal dura mater . The trial population consist 726 randomise ( 1:1 ) patient elect skull base surgery . The trial duration consist screen , surgery , efficacy follow-up 7±1 week safety follow-up 28±2 week surgery .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Main Inclusion Criteria ( Positive response ) : • Is surgical approach/procedure consistent skull base surgery ? I.e . one following : Lateral approach foramen magnum : Far lateral , extreme lateral , anterolateral , posterolateral Approach jugular foramen : Infratemporal , juxta condylar , transjugular Approach cerebello pontine ( CP ) angle petrous apex retrosigmoid Approach middle fossa : Subtemporal ( +/ petrous apex drill ) , pterional approach ( fronto temporal approach +/ orbitozygomatic deposition ) Approach anterior fossa : Subfrontal ( uni bilateral ) Approach midline posterior fossa Main Exclusion Criteria ( Negative response ) : Has patient subject neurosurgery involve open dura mater within last 3 month ? Is patient anticipated undergo additional neurosurgery involve open dura mater may affect efficacy evaluation ( e.g . reoperation anticipation undergo several neurosurgery ) Efficacy Followup Week 7±1 week ? Is patient anticipated undergo additional neurosurgery involve open dura mater may affect safety evaluation ( e.g . reoperation anticipation undergo several neurosurgery ) Safety Followup Week 28±2 week ? The surgical approach/procedure consistent transcranial transfacial combination transcranial transfacial approach wide defect skull base ? I.e . follow : Trans basal approach Total petrosectomy Trans facial approach Trans sphenoidal approach Endoscopic procedure Trans oral approach ( extension : Le Fort , mandibulotomy ) The surgical approach consistent one follow approach ? Translabyrinthine approach Retrolabyrinthine approach Transcochlear ( limited transpetrosal ) approach Did arachnoid membrane CSF containing system remain intact surgery ? Does patient one dura opening ( include dura opening extraventricular lumbar drain ) ? Has TachoSil , fibrin polymer sealant use current surgery prior randomization ?</criteria>
