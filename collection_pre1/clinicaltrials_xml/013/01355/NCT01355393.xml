	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose rintatolimod give together vaccine therapy sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) see well work treat patient stage II-IV human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive breast cancer . Vaccines make synthetic HER2/neu peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell express HER-2/neu . Adjuvant therapy , GM-CSF rintatolimod , additional cancer treatment give primary treatment low risk cancer come back one way help vaccine produce strong immune response . Giving vaccine therapy together rintatolimod and/or GM-CSF may safe effective treatment breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Combination With Rintatolimod and/or Sargramostim Treating Patients With Stage II-IV HER2-Positive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To choose promising ( maximum biologic dose [ MBD ] ) five different dos ( 4 , 20 , 79 , 495 2000 mcg ) Ampligen ( rintatolimod ) administer intradermally ( i.d . ) adjuvant HER2 vaccination , respect toxicity incidence magnitude immune response . II . To determine , use MBD Ampligen ( define first primary aim ) , whether Ampligen give GM-CSF combined adjuvant strategy HER2 vaccination increase incidence magnitude HER2 Th1 immunity compare standard GM-CSF adjuvant strategy . OUTLINE : This phase I-II randomize two-stage HER2 vaccine study breast cancer patient . STUDY STAGE I : There five group patient randomize 1 5 arm arm receiving synthetic HER-2/neu peptide vaccine admix rintatolimod ( different dos ) give i.d . STUDY STAGE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive synthetic HER-2/neu peptide vaccine admixed rintatolimod give i.d . ARM II : 24 patient receive HER-2/neu peptide vaccine admix GM-CSF 24 patient receive HER-2/neu peptide vaccine admix GM-CSF addition rintatolimod ( dose set Stage I group active response ) give i.d . In study stage , treatment repeat every month 3 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion last vaccine , patient follow 1 12 month .</detailed_description>
