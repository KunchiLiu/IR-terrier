	<brief_summary>Electrical stimulation carotid baroreceptor ( baropacing ) acutely decrease arterial pressure patient refractory hypertension . The reduction blood pressure seem mediate sympathetic inhibition concomitant reduction activity renin-angiotensin system . Indeed , switch stimulation accompany decrease increase central sympathetic vasoconstrictor outflow , respectively . Plasma renin concentration also decrease acute electrical baroreflex stimulation . In patient chronic baropacing associate long-term blood pressure reduction . However , sparse information relative contribution blood pressure regulate system account acute chronic effect baropacing . Sympathetic , renal , vascular mechanism special interest . Furthermore , technical aspect electrical baroreflex stimulation may play role , e.g . worsen electrical contact stimulate electrode baroreceptor afferent . This study design answer follow primary question : 1 . Does chronic electrical stimulation carotid baroreceptor inhibit sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone also long-term ? 2 . Does sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone increase switch chronic baropacing ? Such increase would confirm electrical integrity system proper contact baroreceptor afferent . 3 . Does acute electrical baroreflex stimulation decrease renal vascular resistance ? 4 . Does acute electrical baroreflex stimulation influence glucose delivery skeletal muscle change insulin sensitivity ? The study follow open-label observational design plan recruit 30 patient 3 year .</brief_summary>
