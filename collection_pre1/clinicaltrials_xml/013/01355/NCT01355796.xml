	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) lung disease characterize chronic bacterial colonization recurrent infection airway . Disruption cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel subject CF result alter fluid electrolyte transport across airway epithelium thereby initiating infection . These infection eventually destroy lung contribute significant morbidity mortality patient CF . It well know antibacterial activity innate immune mediator lysozyme beta defensins human airway surface liquid ( ASL ) salt-sensitive ; increase salt concentration inhibit activity . Conversely , activity increase low ionic strength . Lowering ASL salt concentration increase ASL volume might therefore potentiate innate immunity therefore decrease prevent airway infection subject CF . Xylitol , five-carbon sugar low transepithelial permeability , poorly metabolize bacteria low salt concentration cystic fibrosis ( CF ) non-CF epithelia vitro . Xylitol artificial sweetener successfully use chew gums prevent dental caries ; use oral sugar substitute without significant adverse effect . It also show decrease incidence acute otitis medium 20-40 % ; nasal application normal human subject find decrease colonization coagulase negative staphylococcus . The investigator find aerosolized iso-osmolar xylitol safe mouse , healthy volunteer stable subject CF administer single day . In recent study , investigator observe single dos 10 % follow 15 % xylitol well tolerate subject cystic fibrosis stable . In study , investigator plan study safety efficacy 2 week inhale xylitol compare 2 week hypertonic saline randomize crossover design stable subject cystic fibrosis</detailed_description>
