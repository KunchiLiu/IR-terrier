	<detailed_description>Untreated pain also cause long term impact newborn , Some scientist foreign country do research rat , find rat expose pain long time , nociception neural circuit 's development harm , pain threshold lower . For newborn , untreated pain cause hypalgesia puberty hyperalgesia adulthood . The experience pain infancy also affect baby ' late life grow , may cause emotional problem , minimal brain dysfunction , social intercourse defect . So important find useful intervention decrease pain newborn , consider long term impact side effect medicine , seldom use medical intervention decrease pain .

For breast-feeding , include nursing mother console impact , hugging , attention transferring , taste , breast milk contain tryptophane , precursor N-acetyl-5-O-T raise density β-endorphin , β-endorphin analgesic effect . For non-nutritive sucking , also contain attention transfer . It say non-nutritive sucking raise pain threshold stimulating oral tactile recipient , promote release 5-HT modulates pain . Non-nutritive sucking also low sensitivity peripheral nerve .</detailed_description>
