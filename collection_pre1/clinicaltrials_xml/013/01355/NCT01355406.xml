	<brief_summary>This clinical study new self-expanding stent ( FlexStent® ) design specifically cope extreme demand superficial femoral artery ( SFA ) /proximal popliteal artery . The artery often abbreviate femoropopliteal . The intent study demonstrate FlexStent® Femoropopliteal Self-Expanding Stent System safe effective treatment patient peripheral arterial disease . Specifically , FlexStent® shall meet exceed propose safety efficacy performance goal establish Femoropopliteal bare nitinol stent patient symptomatic peripheral arterial disease .</brief_summary>
