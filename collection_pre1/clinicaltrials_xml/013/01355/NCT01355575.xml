	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Hypothesis : Reduction gut flora antibiotic Rifaximin reduce hepatic inflammation non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . Objectives : Primary : - To assess whether endoluminal antimicrobial property Rifaximin lead change hepatocellular inflammation NASH Secondary : - To determine whether Rifaximin 's effect bowel flora lead : altered cytokine profile , decrease insulin resistance reduce hepatic steatosis - To corroborate previously identify urinary marker non-alcoholic fatty liver disease associate bacterial choline metabolism use urinary proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy STUDY DESIGN A proof-of-concept open-label randomize control cross-over interventional cohort study . Twenty four patient biopsy-proven mild moderate NASH recruit prospectively 9 month assess four time-points screen visit : baseline ; 6 week ; 12 week 18 week . Participants randomize receive either Rifaximin 400mg twice day 6 week standard care ( SoC ) 6 week , SoC 6 week Rifaximin 400mg twice day 6 week , undergo 6 week observational washout period without additional therapy . An additional four patient identify reserve patient add cohort case patient original cohort drop-out . Based exist biochemical data patient attend sub-specialty Hepatology-Diabetology NASH Clinic St Mary 's drawn `` HEP-Base '' database , 24 patient provide 90 % power detect 25.0 IU/l change biochemical steatohepatitis significance level ( alpha ) 0.05 ( two-tailed ) . This study design offer three key benefit : ( 1 ) patient receive treatment , make design efficient ; ( 2 ) control group patient study condition ( 3 ) patient observe 6-12 week washout phase follow Rifaximin treatment , provide data duration effect . Suitable patient identify use departmental HEP-Base patient database , hold detailed clinical record patient see sub-specialty NASH clinic St Mary 's Hospital , assessment carry Hepatology Clinical Research Facility ( CRF ) St Mary 's . Patients randomize receive Rifaximin treatment investigation . Patients assess medical clinician assessment point dietary , drug physical activity questionnaire complete biometrics measure . The total duration study 18 month . The duration patient 's participation 18 week . Twenty four participant recruit directly study 4 reserve , patient NASH . STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES The study outcome measure choose support directly study objective follow : Primary outcome measure : • Change serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) value &gt; 25 IU/l ( approximately 33 % mean NASH value ) 6 week therapy Secondary outcome measure : - Change insulin resistance - assess use hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp method within CRF - serum triglyceride level lipoprotein profile also assess procedure - Change hepatic triglyceride content - Change serum cytokine level - Change quantity composition faecal flora - Urinary metabolic profile - Change plasma level bacterial endotoxin PARTICIPANT ENTRY PRE-ENROLLMENT EVALUATIONS All patient assess clinically part routine clinical assessment subspecialty NASH clinic St Mary 's Hospital . This consider part clinical study occur prior enrolment . This assessment include : - medical history - thorough clinical examination - clinical investigation exclude coexist liver disease , co-morbidities medication might confound study outcome , specify exclusion criterion include , limited : - serology viral hepatitis ( B , C ) - serum iron study - autoimmune screen - clinical serum lipid profile - fast glucose glycosylated haemoglobin - ultrasound liver If clinically indicate , patient refer liver biopsy diagnosis suspect NASH result histology evaluate accord criterion Kleiner et al . WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA Participants may withdraw participation study stage , without give reason without jeopardize future clinical care . They ask reason withdrawal , reason provide , include study data . Other withdrawal criterion include : 1 . Any participant serious adverse event preclude drug administration 2 . Significant deviation protocol 3 . Significant non-compliance study medication 4 . If subject long eligible 5 . If subject lose follow-up 6 . If Investigator believe withdrawal best interest If participant wish withdraw consent , data pertain manage follow : 1 . Participants attend study visit take treatment consider enrol study exclude analysis 2 . Participants attend few 3 study visit start Rifaximin treatment exclude analysis 3 . Participants attend few 3 study visit complete course Rifaximin treatment include analysis adverse event , exclude analysis study endpoints 4 . Participants complete 3 study visit six-week course Rifaximin treatment include final analysis study endpoint Reserve patient recruit event participant withdrawal per point 2 3 . Samples data collect period time participant consent study retain analysis laid study protocol . RANDOMISATION AND ENROLLMENT PROCEDURE This open-label , randomize , crossover , control study . At enrollment visit , seal envelope contain letter assign participant either group A ( n=12 ) group B ( n=12 ) give participant random research nurse , unaware assignment within envelope . TREATMENT ARMS All participant receive Rifaximin 400mg ( 2 x 200mg tablet ) orally , twice daily six week . Group A receive Rifaximin first 6 week SoC . Group B receive SoC 6 week Rifaximin . DOSE MODIFICATIONS FOR TOXICITY There plan dose modification drug minimally absorb . In addition , pre-clinical animal study . If adverse event occur , treatment stop . INTERACTION WITH OTHER DRUGS Rifaximin cause cytochrome P450 enzyme induction induce CYP3A4 normal dos ( participant without severe liver dysfunction ) . In addition , minimally absorb , consider interact drug . ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP The total duration study 18 month . The duration patient 's participation 18 week , patient receive active treatment 6 week remainder SoC run-in wash-out SoC . Twenty four participant recruit initially , 4 reserve , patient NASH . One screen visit take place follow liver biopsy sub-specialty NASH clinic St Mary 's Hospital . Enrollment randomization occur screen visit . Following enrolment study , participant attend four assessment point : baseline ; six week ; 12 week 18 week . They ask attend NASH clinic 3 month end study routine assessment provision final urine stool sample . At visit study investigator record compliance adverse event . Where possible , visit coordinate NASH clinic visit minimize inconvenience patient . A baseline visit take place screen visit two week one year liver biopsy . At visit , clinical assessment external examination make , blood drawn laboratory analysis , stool provide microbial analysis urine provide metabolic profiling . Investigators assess participant 's diet lifestyle , include use brief questionnaire . All patient undergo magnetic resonance ( MR ) scan patient Group A undergo hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp study . The patient Group A give study prescription obtain Rifaximin hospital pharmacy start treatment six week . At six week , patient attend second assessment visit . At visit , clinical assessment external examination make , blood drawn laboratory analysis , stool provide microbial analysis urine provide metabolic profiling . Investigators assess participant 's diet lifestyle , include use brief questionnaire . All Ppatients also undergo MR scan hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp assay . The patient Group A finish course Rifaximin continue SoC , patient Group B give study prescription obtain Rifaximin hospital pharmacy start treatment six week . At 12 week , patient attend third assessment visit , finish 6 week course Rifaximin 6 week course SoC . At visit , clinical assessment external examination make , blood drawn laboratory analysis , stool provide microbial analysis urine provide metabolic profiling . Investigators assess participant 's diet lifestyle , include use brief questionnaire . All patient undergo MR scan patient Group B undergo hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp study.Patients also undergo MR scan hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp assay . The patient Group B finish course Rifaximin patient continue SoC . At 18 week , patient attend fourth final assessment visit . At visit , clinical assessment external examination make , blood drawn laboratory analysis , stool provide microbial analysis urine provide metabolic profiling . Investigators assess participant 's diet lifestyle , include use brief questionnaire . The patient ' participation study complete return NASH clinic routine clinical basis appropriate . All participant invite return NASH clinic 3 month end participation study , point undergo routine clinical assessment , addition , ask provide stool urine sample pair lifestyle questionnaire . LOSS TO FOLLOW-UP Given short duration study , loss follow-up consider unlikely . However , If participant attend schedule visit , attempt make contact use contact detail supply screen visit . If contact lose , data include study analysis follow : 1 . Participants attend study visit take treatment consider enrol study exclude analysis 2 . Participants attend few 3 study visit start Rifaximin treatment exclude analysis 3 . Participants attend few 3 study visit complete course Rifaximin treatment include analysis adverse event , exclude analysis study endpoints 4 . Participants complete 3 study visit six-week course Rifaximin treatment include final analysis study endpoint Reserve patient recruit event participant loss follow-up per point 2 3 .
