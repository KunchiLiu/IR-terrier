	<detailed_description>The incidence hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) rise worldwide . Almost case HCC develop clearly define stage chronic hepatic inflammation cirrhosis liver determine irreversible stage process . In Western world excessive alcohol consumption chronic infection hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) frequent cause chronic hepatocellular injury . As HCC often diagnose advanced stage therapeutic intervention possibility limit becomes necessary search prevention strategy stop development HCC . In last year micronutrient selenium reach interest oncologist . Several study able show often low selenium level patient different tumor . Some epidemiologic study show supplementation selenium decrease incidence tumor . Oxidative stress mean play essential role hepatocarcinogenesis selenium could decrease , may possible patient infected hepatitis c - virus show low selenium level probably result chronic hepatic inflammation . Moreover may differences stage disease namely chronic infection , cirrhosis liver hepatocellular carcinoma . The aim trial determine difference . HCV- infected patient enrol trial . Three group form : In Group 1 HCV- infected patient chronic inflammation without cirrhosis liver without HCC summarize . group 2 HCV- infected patient cirrhosis liver without HCC enrol . In group 3 hcv- infected HCC- patient summarize . In group 10 patient enrol , match age disease . Blood sample take patient selenium level measure .</detailed_description>
