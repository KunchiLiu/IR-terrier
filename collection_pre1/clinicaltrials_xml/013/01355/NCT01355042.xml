	<brief_summary>Severe sepsis ( ie . life-threatening infection ) trigger harmful microorganism toxin blood tissue . These harmful agent damage line blood vessel lead inflammation , blood clot formation , vessel obstruction . In Canada , approximately 90,000 patient severe sepsis year . Of , 30 % 50 % die . The identification highly reliable outcome predictor severe sepsis patient important several reason include : help describe severity sepsis , classify patient enrollment clinical study , monitor patient 's response treatment procedure . In investigator lab , investigator examine incremental usefulness add multiple biomarkers clinical score system predict ICU mortality patient severe sepsis . In preliminary study 80 patient sepsis , investigator find high level plasma DNA predict ICU death well clinical biological factor . In grant , investigator propose confirm finding external group 400 patient blinded fashion . The investigator also plan study plasma DNA level change time whether high plasma DNA level use distinguish sepsis critically ill condition . For investigator compare investigator septic patient cohort 600 patient ICU condition . The investigator believe research potential significantly improve management treatment septic patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>DYNAMICS STUDY ( DNA prognostic marker ICU patient ) Principal Investigator : Patricia Liaw , PhD ( McMaster University ) Coinvestigator : Alison Fox-Robichaud , MD ( McMaster University ) Funding source : CIHR , 2010-2015 Budget : $ 794,086 One-page Protocol summary This new 5-year CIHR fund multi-centre prospective observational study . The overall objective gain insight pathophysiology plasma DNA ( ie . cell-free DNA ) severe sepsis patient critically ill patient . In pilot study 80 severe sepsis patient , find plasma DNA extremely high prognostic utility patient population . Using Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve multivariate logistic model , demonstrate Area Under Curve ( AUC ) plasma DNA 0.96 ( 95 % CI 0.93-1.00 ) . Furthermore , plasma DNA level obtain `` day 1 '' ( ie . within 24 hour meet inclusion criterion severe sepsis ) differ significantly level measure subsequent day . In word , plasma DNA level nonsurvivors high `` day 1 '' remain high ; plasma DNA level survivor low `` day 1 '' remain low . These find suggests study inclusion severe sepsis , nonsurvivor patient already reach `` point return '' ( standard care available time patient pilot study recruit ) . We plan validate prognostic utility plasma DNA prospectively independent cohort severe sepsis patient ( n=400 ) . We also study broad cohort non-septic ICU patient ( n=600 ) determine elevation plasma DNA specific severe sepsis , generally associate high mortality risk . These non-septic ICU patient include follow : multiple trauma , shock presentation , neurosurgery , aneurysm , intracranial hemorrhage , burn ) . The overall research coordinator study Ellen McDonald . Participating centre include Hamilton ( Patricia Liaw , Alison Fox-Robichaud , Deborah Cook ) , Ottawa ( Laurlyn McIntyre ) , London ( Claudio Martin , Doug Fraser ) , Vancouver ( Peter Dodek ) , Toronto ( John Marshall , Jennifer Tsang ) , Laval Quebec ( Francois Lallouche ) , Calgary ( Brent Winston ) . Clinical data collect daily first week , week thereafter duration patient ' stay ICU . Blood sample also collect schedule except weekend blood sample skip . Freezerworks Unlimited used barcoding track plasma sample . All sample ship Hamilton biomarker analysis . Clinical data manage iDataFax software statistical support Janice Pogue Population Health Research Institute ( Hamilton ) . The primary outcome ICU mortality . The secondary outcome ( ) temporal relationship plasma DNA level marker inflammation blood clotting , ( b ) temporal relationship plasma DNA level clinical parameter ( e.g . SOFA MODS score , intervention , use blood product plasma expanders ) . This study approve Research Ethics Board Hamilton Health Sciences November 2010 . Deferred consent approve . Although perform DNA sequence analysis patient sample ( ie . simply quantify much DNA plasma ) , also collect Paxgene DNA tubes event future as-yet-undetermined study require DNA gene sequence study . Our local Ethics Board approve separate Genetic Consent form request extra blood sample Paxgene DNA tubes . As May 2012 complete recruitment sepsis arm . We start close site enrolment near study completion</detailed_description>
