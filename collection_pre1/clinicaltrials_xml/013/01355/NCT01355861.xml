	<detailed_description>The chief aim protocol determine efficacy negative work progressive resistance exercise ( PRE ) management sarcopenia old male Veterans DC VAMC . This propose study randomize clinical trial use single-arm , delayed cross-over design repeat measure . This method patient-first approach clinical research permit participant receive intervention allow investigator conduct within subject subject comparison modest study enrollment . During `` pre-treatment period '' recruit , screen , consent 30 old men sarcopenia . The participant randomize two group : active treatment delay treatment . The initial `` active treatment '' `` delay treatment '' period last 12 week . After 12 week , participant delay treatment group crossover ( without washout period ) start 12 week intervention . All participant detrain monitor follow respective 12-week `` post treatment '' period . Outcome measure include post-exercise change metabolic inflammatory marker , muscle morphology , strength , functional status .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult , ambulatory male &gt; 60 year old ( n=30 ) recruit propose study . Participant inclusion criterion also include clinically significant sarcopenia base body composition assessment show aLM &lt; 2 SD mean value young adult reference group use DEXA scanning . Exclusion criterion include BMI score &gt; 30 MiniMental Status exam score &lt; 22 . The second tier screen include follow blood test , obtain 89 AM , follow 12hour overnight fast : CBC , routine chemistry profile ( e.g. , glucose , kidney liver function test ) . Veterans elevate fast blood glucose WHO criteria ( FBG &gt; 110 mg/dl ) , triglyceride level &gt; 200 mg/dL , and/or know DM , abnormalities routine blood test ( i.e. , &gt; 2 SD beyond normal ) exclude study . Uncontrolled cardiovascular disease , nonambulatory status , evidence major disease exacerbation last six month , current participation supervise exercise program ( minimum three month , twice per week ) would also preclude participation study .</criteria>
