	<brief_summary>To determine safety manufacture feasibility IV autologous chimeric immune receptor ( CIR ) T cell transfected anti-mesothelin messenger RNA ( mRNA ) express single chain antibody variable fragment link intracellular CD 3 zeta T cell receptor domain 4-1BB costimulatory domain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Redirected RNA Meso-CIR T Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study test safety infuse study product CIR T cell . These T cell make use T cell obtain apheresis introduce T cell temporary gene cause start make new type antibody attach mesothelin ( antibody find surface cancer cell ) . In theory , modify T cell attach mesothelin , cell activate stimulate subject 's immune system attack mesothelin cell . This type modify cell call T cell transduce transfected chimeric anti-mesothelin immunoreceptor . Subjects enrol serially subject receive 1xe8 1x1e9 modify CIR T cell every day 3 infusion . Each patient observe 9 day toxicity assessment prior receive second cycle modify CIR T cell every day 3 infusion . The precede subject must complete two-cycle regimen observe toxicity day 21 next subject enrol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must histologically confirm MPM ( epithelial biphasic ) . Subjects must complete standard first line therapy platinumbased double regimen PD must choose pursue primary standard care therapy . ECOG performance status 0 1 . Age great 18 year Life expectancy &gt; 4 month At least 2 week since prior concurrent chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy ( e.g. , interferon , tumor necrosis factor , interleukin , monoclonal antibody ) . In addition , patient must fully recover adverse event related agent . More 4 week since prior concurrent investigational agent . Subjects must measurable disease define accept MPM measurement technique ( modify RECIST criterion ) . Blood coagulation parameter : PT international normalize ratio ( INR ) &lt; 1.5 ( inrange INR , usually 2 3 , subject stable dose therapeutic warfarin management venous thrombosis include pulmonary thromboembolus ) PTT &lt; 1.2 time upper limit normal . Subjects must adequate venous peripheral access apheresis . Patients must also adequate venous access subsequent modify CIR Tcell administration do central venous access ( e.g . port systemic chemotherapy ) . Shortterm therapy acute condition specifically relate MPM allow therapy include immune modulate agent . Male Female subject agree use approve contraceptive method ( e.g . birth control pill , barrier device , intrauterine device , abstinence ) study 3 month follow last dose study cell infusion . Subject must understand sign studyspecific inform consent . Satisfactory organ bone marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,000/µl Platelets &gt; 100,000/µl Hematocrit &gt; 30 % AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3x institutional normal upper limit Bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL unless secondary malignant bile duct obstruction Creatinine &lt; 1.5x institutional normal upper limit Previously treat investigation therapy within 1 month prior screen . Sacromatoid MPM histology express mesothelin Prior invasive malignancy unless surgically medically cure without evidence recurrent disease 5 year exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , prostate cancer PSA level &lt; 1.0 . Prior hematologic malignancy bone marrow transplantation immune modify therapy within past 4 week exception thyroid replacement . Use immunosuppressive drug 4 week prior study entry , anticipate use immunosuppressive agent . Any clinically significant pericardial effusion , CHF ( NY Heart Association Grade IIIV ) , cardiovascular condition . Any clinically significant pleural effusion ascites drain standard approach preenrollment dwell drainage device placement . Forced vital capacity &lt; 50 % predict , DLCO &lt; 40 % predict . Underlying lung disease require supplemental oxygen therapy . Have recognize immunodeficiency disease include cellular immunodeficiency , hypogammaglobulinemia , dysgammaglobulinemia ; patient acquire hereditary , congenital immunodeficiency . Viral infection : HIV , HCV , HBV . Pregnant woman exclude study autologous transduce T cell , breastfeed discontinue mother treat . Feasibility assessment screen demonstrate &lt; 30 % transfection target lymphocytes , &lt; 5fold expansion modify CIR Tcells response CD3/CD28 costimulation .</criteria>
