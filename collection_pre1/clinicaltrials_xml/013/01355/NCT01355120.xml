	<brief_summary>This open-label , multi-center , single-arm clinical phase II study characterize efficacy safety ipilimumab patient without systemic pretreatment metastatic ocular melanoma . The DeCOG-MM-PAL11-Trial continued patient ocular melanoma sufficient number cutaneous mucosal melanoma patient already recruit . In order allow separate subgroup analysis plan protocol ocular melanoma mandatory focus recruitment patient population . Only guarantee valid evaluation cohort . Ocular melanoma define melanomas originate uvea , choroid , ciliary body conjunctiva . ( see McCartney ACE `` Pathology ocular melanoma '' British Medical Bulltta , 1995 , Vol 51 , No 3 pp 678-693 ) The criterion treatment procedure use applied patient advance ocular melanoma . Since treatment standard patient exist , also patient without prior systemic treatment include study . Therefore , 5th inclusion criterion adapt order enrol eligible patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment : Treatment anti-CTLA-4 mAb Ipilimumab monotherapy patient scope trial define induction plus re-induction eligible patient 12 month first receipt study medication Induction phase : Ipilimumab apply melanoma patient accord protocol complete Medarex study MDX-010-20 : Ipilimumab IV infusion , 3 mg/kg , day 1 ( Week 1 ) , 22 ( Week 4 ) , 43 ( Week 7 ) , 64 ( Week 10 ) Re-induction : Patients progress follow stable disease ≥ 3 month duration start diagnosis week 12 tumor assessment patient progress follow initial response ( partial complete ) assess week 12 may offer additional cycle therapy originally assign treatment regimen off-treatment criterion meet , provide meet re-treatment eligibility requirement . No patient re-treated experience Grade 3 high gastrointestinal certain immune-related adverse event ( irAE ) ( refer section 5.2 5.3 ) . No patient disease progression follow first cycle study medication permit re-treated study medication . Examinations : The disease assess baseline , 12 week patient stable disease well response , thereafter every 12 week absence PD maximum one year . Response evaluation do accord immune-related response criterion ( Wolchok et al. , CCR 2009 ) . All patient prematurely discontinue treatment due drug-related adverse event prior Week 12 ( absence disease progression ) return study visit procedure include Week 12 , appropriate , re-staging assessment . Any patient document progression schedule re-staging visit receive re-induction undergo re-staging visit . Follow-up phase : Survival assess every 3 month final dose Ipilimumab end follow-up phase individual patient . FU phase subject 1 year follow first treatment dose . End study recruitment finish plus 1 year post start treatment last patient thus ensure 1 year survival rate estimate . Study duration : End study 1 year post LPFV . Recruiting period ocular melanoma : Period recruit 12-18 month Enrolment start date ( FPI ) : QIII 2011 Enrolment finish date ( LPI ) : QI 2013 End study : QI 2014</detailed_description>

Women childbearing potential ( WOCP ) must use effective method contraception ( PearlIndex &lt; 1 , e.g . oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive [ vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ] , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method [ diaphragm , spermicide ] ) throughout study 26 week last dose investigational product , manner risk pregnancy minimize . No men father potential men father potential must use effective method contraception avoid conception throughout study 26 week last dose investigational product , manner risk pregnancy minimize . WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Women use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( eg , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) Baseline within 7 day start ipilimumab week 12 . Exclusion Criteria Patients exclude study follow reason : 1 . The patient require concomitant therapy following : IL 2 , interferon , nonstudy immunotherapy regimen ; cytotoxic chemotherapy ; immunosuppressive agent ; investigation therapy ; systemic therapy cancer include experimental treatment . 2 . The patient require chronic use systemic corticosteroid . Systemic steroids management symptom due brain mets avoid possible subject stable low clinically effective dose . Topical inhalational steroid permit . 3 . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) study treatment . 4 . Active autoimmune disease : Patients history inflammatory bowel disease , include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's Disease , exclude study , patient history symptomatic disease ( eg , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic progressive sclerosis [ scleroderma ] , systemic lupus erythematosus , autoimmune vasculitis [ eg , Wegener 's Granulomatosis ] ) ; motor neuropathy consider autoimmune origin ( e.g . GuillainBarre Syndrome Myasthenia Gravis ) . 5 . Symptomatic CNS metastasis ( Remark : Asymptomatic stable , untreated pretreated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis allow ) 6 .
