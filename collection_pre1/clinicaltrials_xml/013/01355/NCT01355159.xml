	<brief_title>High Dose Folic Acid Supplementation Throughout Pregnancy Preeclampsia Prevention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia complication pregnancy affect least 5 % pregnancy worldwide serious health consequence woman baby . Preeclampsia hypertension ( high blood pressure ) pregnancy proteinuria . Proteinuria protein find urine , sign kidney function properly . The effective treatment preeclampsia delivery baby . Because delivery may require anticipated date delivery ; preeclampsia also one lead cause preterm delivery account 25 % low birth weight infant . Recent research also show woman preeclampsia pregnancy likely risk future cardiovascular event later life . Recently study show supplementation multivitamin contain folic acid associate reduce risk develop preeclampsia . These finding also suggest prevention preeclampsia , high dose folic acid ( much high amount folate receive food intake usually take pregnancy ) may need . Even though result study show folic acid may play role prevention preeclampsia , additional study need determine conclusively high dose supplementation folic acid throughout pregnancy preventative effect pregnant woman high risk average pregnant woman develop preeclampsia .</detailed_description>
