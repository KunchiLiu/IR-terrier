	<brief_summary>Shoulder pain common person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . It often cause overuse injury muscle tendon occur wheelchair propulsion , transfer , activity daily live . Normally , shoulder pain resolve conservative treatment non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( e.g . aspirin , ibuprofen , naproxen , etc . ) physical therapy . However , treatment fail , shoulder surgery may option . Platelet Rich Plasma therapy , PRP , treatment option non-healing muscle tendon injury cause shoulder pain person SCI . Using one 's blood , cell within blood call `` platelet '' concentrate re-injected muscle tendon shoulder . These platelet release substance know `` growth factor '' lead tissue healing . By concentrate platelet increase growth factor eight time promote heal tendon . PRP therapy show promise treat tendon muscle injury able-bodied person ; however , effectiveness person SCI unknown . The purpose study explore feasibility , safety , efficacy PRP therapy chronic shoulder pain person SCI . The human body remarkable ability heal hypothesize re-injecting concentrated platelet facilitate natural heal process reduce shoulder pain person SCI .</brief_summary>
