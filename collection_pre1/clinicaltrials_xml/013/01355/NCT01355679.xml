	<criteria>Patients must histologically prove neuroblastoma confirmation refractory recurrent disease histologic confirmation diagnosis time recurrence/progression Patients must age &gt; 12 month ≤ 21 initial diagnosis . Life expectancy must 3 month If measurable disease , must demonstrate residual abnormal tissue primary metastatic site measure 1 cm dimension standardize imaging ( CT MRI ) ; tumor must accessible biopsy . Patients bone marrow disease expect &gt; 75 % eligible enroll . Current disease state must one currently know curative therapy Lansky KarnofskyScore must 50 Patients without bone marrow metastases must ANC &gt; 750/μl platelet count &gt; 50,000/μl Adequate liver function must demonstrate , define : Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age AND SGPT ( ALT ) &lt; 10 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age No significant organ toxicity define &gt; Grade 2 National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events NCICTCAE V4.0 A negative serum pregnancy test require female participant child bear potential ( ≥ 13 year age onset menses ) Both male female postpubertal study subject need agree use one effective birth control method treatment six month treatment stop . These method include total abstinence ( sex ) , oral contraceptive ( `` pill '' ) , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , levonorgestrol implant ( Norplant ) , medroxyprogesterone acetate injection ( Depoprovera shot ) . If one use , contraceptive foam condom recommend . Informed Consent : All patient and/or legal guardian must sign informed write consent . Assent , appropriate , obtain accord institutional guideline . Voluntary consent optional biology study include . Patients receive chemotherapy within last 7 day prior enrollment 14 day prior study treatment start date . Patients receive radiotherapy within last 30 day must another site disease follow . Patients receive antitumor therapy disease investigational drug concurrently Patients serious infection lifethreatening illness ( unrelated tumor ) &gt; Grade 2 ( NCI CTCAE V4.0 ) , active , serious infection require parenteral antibiotic therapy . Patients medical condition , include malabsorption syndrome , mental illness substance abuse , deem Investigator likely interfere interpretation result would interfere patient 's ability sign legal guardian 's ability sign inform consent , patient 's ability cooperate participate study</criteria>
