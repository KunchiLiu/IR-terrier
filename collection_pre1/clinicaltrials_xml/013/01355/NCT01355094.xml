	<brief_summary>This pilot study evaluate effectiveness actively remove peritoneal fluid use commercial suction device compare passive drainage peritoneal fluid drain standard surgical drain bulb suction , critically ill patient require `` open abdomen '' . Both technique use , commercial KCI AbThera™ device home make `` Stampede '' VAC system , currently approve use Canada use facility . The use non-use open abdomen relationship intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) , level IAH must treat treated - remain controversial . The ultimate treatment IAH/ACS leave abdominal fascia open laparotomy , utilize form temporary abdominal closure ( TAC ) technique , result `` open abdomen '' ( OA ) . The decision accept OA make operating room typically make quite arbitrarily ( current standard protocol ) , TAC use base surgeon 's best judgment . The study intend randomize patient decide TAC require , apply operating room patient fully anesthetize . The intervention require obtain small aliquot ( teaspoonful-15ml ) blood evaluation inflammatory mediator level , well volume intra-peritoneal fluid-that typically discarded patient OA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Peritoneal Vacuum Therapy Reduce Inflammatory Response From Abdominal Sepsis/Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excessive pressure within peritoneal cavity , know intra-abdominal hypertension ( IAH ) , adversely affect intra-peritoneal organ function , also organ system throughout body . When IAH &gt; 20 mmHg induces new organ dysfunction , potentially lethal condition know abdominal compartment syndrome ( ACS ) define . Practically , syndrome consider multi-system organ failure occur severe IAH . While physical effect IAH/ACS increasingly describe , humoral one , related IAH-induced ischemia poorly understood . Recent animal work suggest aggressively remove intra-peritoneal fluid , assume vasoactive mediator-rich , lead good systemic outcome . There human data support however . Previous attempt peritoneal drainage inflammatory condition sepsis pancreatitis conclusive , may due inefficiency system use lack attention IAH . Recently , efficient system provide temporary abdominal closure ( TAC ) drain intra-peritoneal fluid control IAH introduce . One dress system , know KCI AbThera™ Abdominal Dressing currently approve use Canada temporary abdominal closure ( TAC ) device role ameliorate systemic sepsis/SIRS evaluate . We propose randomized trial use either `` home Calgary Stampede Vac '' involve wall suction KCI AbThera™ Abdominal Dressing , dress abdomen whenever operative surgeon determines open abdomen warrant treat patient . In general , others hypothesize cytokine , especially peritoneal level , sensitive indicator post-operative inflammatory reaction may predict complication . In experimental model IL-6 level higher non-survivors . Further , previous work note blood level IL-6 , long half life TNF-α IL-1β , good index overall cytokine cascade activation . Thus main outcome compare mean cytokine level measure two treatment group - determine KCI AbThera™ Abdominal Dressing significantly reduce blood concentration IL-6 compare `` Stampede VAC '' system . We hop well understand body respond inflammatory process naturally occur episode intra-abdominal hypertension , identify signal marker inflammation infection well progression outcome .</detailed_description>
