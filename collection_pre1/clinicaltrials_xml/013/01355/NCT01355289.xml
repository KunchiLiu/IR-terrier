	<brief_summary>The study three phase : Prerandomization , Randomization ( Core Study ) , Extension . The Randomization Phase may include Treatment Periods A1 A2 ( depend when/if subject enter open-label extension , follow-up period ( subject continue open-label extension ) . The open-label extension may include Treatment Periods B1 , B2 , B3 ( depend subject enter open label extension ) , follow-up period . Subjects may follow sustained viral response , appropriate . In Core Study ( randomization phase ) subject randomize ( 1:1:1:1 ratio ) receive one four treatment ( placebo E5501 [ 10mg , 20mg , 30mg ] 21 day . Subjects successfully complete Treatment Period A1 platelet count sufficient enable initiation antiviral treatment PEG-IFN . The open label extension period consist three ( depend if/when subject enter ) Open-label Treatment Periods ( B1 , B2 , B3 ) follow-up period . During open-label treatment , subject begin once-daily treatment E5501 dose 20 mg . In Treatment Periods B2 B3 , subject allow E5501 dose titrate accordance individual response , within range minimum 5mg maximum 50mg .</brief_summary>
