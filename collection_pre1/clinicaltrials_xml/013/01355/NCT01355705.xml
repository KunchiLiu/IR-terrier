	<brief_title>Phase 1-2 Amrubicin Combo With Lenalidomide + Weekly Dexamethasone Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES - Establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) toxicity profile combination amrubicin lenalidomide dexamethasone previously treat adult patient multiple myeloma Phase I - Determine combine rate complete response ( CR ) good partial response ( VGPR ) combination population define International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria ( IMWGURC ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES - Determine overall response rate ( CR , VGPR PR ) - Assess additional evidence ant-tumor activity measure duration response ( DOR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) , time tumor progression ( TTP ) , overall survival ( OS )</detailed_description>
