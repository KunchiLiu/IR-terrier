	<brief_summary>The Stanislas Cohort monocentric familial longitudinal cohort comprise 1006 family ( 4295 subject ) Nancy region recruit 1993-1995 Centre Preventive Medicine ( Centre de Médecine Préventive , CMP ) , Vandoeuvre lès Nancy 5-year periodic health examination , auspex Caisse Nationale d'Assurance Maladie ( CNAM ) . This cohort establish primary objective investigate gene-gene gene-environment interaction field cardiovascular disease , base study inter-individual variability familial segregation analysis biological morphological intermediate phenotype cardiovascular risk . The longitudinal nature study enable take account evolution intermediate phenotype relate genetic factor throughout follow-up period . The family , consist two parent least two biological child , deem healthy , free declare acute and/or chronic illness , order ass effect genetics variability intermediate phenotype study physiological condition ( without influence , absence ) pathology . The Stanislas Cohort , nationally internationally , longitudinal familial cohort supposedly healthy subject large scale . Brief summary ancillary study `` Cardiac Functional Indices Comparison Between MRI Echocardiography '' : ESCIF study ancillary study Stanislas cohort aim compare cohort supposedly healthy subject different cardiac functional index two different modality : Echocardiography MRI . Indeed , new cardiac functional index recently develop scope echocardiography would useful MRI . In echography compute either tissue Doppler imaging specific image analysis call speckle tracking . These two technique accessible MRI Generalized Reconstruction Inversion Coupled Systems ( GRICS ) technology provide motion model strain strain rate may derive allow long acquisition without constraint breath hold ( mandatory reach high temporal resolution ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>- 4th Visit 17 Years Cohort STANISLAS - Stanislas Ancillary Study ESCIF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MAIN STUDY Follow-up visit No . 4 currently schedule , plan 2011 2016 . Objectives : - Conduct fourth visit , 2011-2016 , enable follow-up 17 year cohort population . - Enrich sample collection new biobanks clinical phenotyping cohort conduct select specific investigation support specific scientific hypothesis protocols - Evaluate long-term ( follow-up , monitoring ) clinical , biological , morphological data analyzing : - The influence age ( average age parent 1993 : 45 year 2010-2012 : 62 year ) . - The incidence change prevalence cardiovascular risk factor comprise metabolic syndrome ( MS ) , familial segregation , since early second visit , one hundred family , least one family member present MS accord definition NCEP-ATPIII . Approximately 20 % adult high blood pressure ( hypertension ) , 50 % body mass index 25 kg/m2 . - The genetic environmental determinant , multifaceted approach include familial segregation candidate gene , progression cardiovascular risk incidence cardiovascular disease ( vascular coronary disease , heart failure ) . Methodology , Organization : All Cohort member contact participate fourth visit . The data collect identical collect previous visit . However , enrich new clinical phenotyping conduct CIC ( principal investigator Prof. Zannad ) : collection blood urine sample ( DNA , RNA , lymphocytic extract , plasma biobank , urology biobank ) , morphological investigation ( electrocardiogram , echocardiography , carotid echotracking , arterial stiffness , systolic pressure index , abdominal aortic ultrasound ) . Based previous participation rate , recruitment 2,000 participant ( 500 family ) possible . Expected Results : This reconvening , follow-up 17 year Stanislas Cohort , unique familial nature already contribute significant manner term knowledge generate , enable addition long-term continuation initial objective ( gene-environment interaction cardiovascular disease : Sophie Visvikis-Siest ) identify specifically natural history evolution cardiovascular risk factor , include metabolic syndrome component well incidence transition mechanism toward common cardiovascular disease , notably vascular coronary disease heart failure . ANCILLARY STUDY Detailed description ESCIF ancillary study - Dr. BONNEMAINS : Objectives : - compare cardiac functional index measure MRI GRICS technique equivalent index measure echocardiography . - assess inter-observer reproducibility echography MRI . Organization : 76 subject Stanislas cohort include prospectively two group accord echocardiographic strain tissue Doppler velocity acquire echocardiography : 38 subject normal index , 38 alter index . Each subject propose MRI examination GRICS technique day assess index . Study design = interventional : MRI . Prospective Number group : 2 Enrollment : 76 Last inclusion ESCIF study : 23/09/2014 SUBSTUDY : PHRC I 2013 - BioSe-PreIC - Dr HUTTIN : diagnostic performance circulate biomarkers early screen heart failure Design : non interventionnal study Main objective : Determine contribution , addition ( ontop ) subject 's clinical characteristic , circulate biomarkers assay ( Gal-3 , PIIINP , ST2 ) general population screen early stage heart failure ( Stage B : asymptomatic patient structural abnormality ) validate trans-thoracic echocardiography ( diastolic function leave ventricular mass ) Inclusion crieria : Subjects participate 4th visit STANISLAS cohort Subjets 40 year old Non-inclusion criterion : Blood sample echocardiography unavailable Known cardiopathy Modarate severe sympptoms link heart failure Présence abnormal diastolic function ( E/Ea ratio 8 ) and/or leave ventricular hypertrophy ( left ventricular mass 125 g/m² men 110 g/m² woman ) .</detailed_description>
