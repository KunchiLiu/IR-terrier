	<brief_summary>The objective determine add repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation prior Cognitive Processing Therapy significantly enhance recovery hyperarousal symptoms individual combat relate post traumatic stress disorder improve clinical outcome . The investigator assemble multimodal human performance laboratory include 64 channel EEG repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation system . These resource combine neuroimaging capability Advanced Imaging Research Center ( AIRC ) UT Southwestern skilled Cognitive Processing Therapy ( CPT ) practitioner use study . The study involve approximately 19 visit . Treatment week 12 week follow 1 month , 3 month 6 month follow-up appointment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We first screen participant age 18 60 year symptoms PTSD determine subjective reporting . We also screen healthy control participant participate comparison assessment phase study . After meet pre-screen criterion , extensive screening determine eligibility subject perform . This follow EEG . The EEG system measure event-related potential ( ERPs ) , explain certain cognitive process base change amplitude time electrical change record surface scalp . We use ERP task include combat-threatening stimulus novel oddball probe ass P300 response . The amplitude P300 ( positive amplitude record 300 millisecond stimulus onset ) use differentiate hypo- , normo- , hyper-arousability . Identifying hyperarousal P300 response ERP allow identification PTSD patient subjective objective measure hyperarousal . The participant schedule neuroimaging session . During neuroimaging , participant structural functional brain scan acquire , include functional MRI scan use threatening/nonthreatening stimulus , thus provide another objective measure hyperarousal . Participants active sham 1 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) administer right frontal lobe well Cognitive Processing Therapy ( CPT ) per week twelve week ( total 12 rTMS-CPT session ) . Studies show rTMS apply externally forehead region dorsal lateral forehead safely , reversibly , painlessly down-modulate frontal lobe side head apply . Our preliminary study show application frontal rTMS reduce response threaten stimulus temporarily optimize effectiveness CPT . Following 12 session rTMS-CPT , EEG neuroimaging repeat test change brain function . In summary , study involve approximately 19 visit . Treatment week 12 week follow 1 month , 3 month 6 month follow-up appointment . - The first 2-3 visit involve inform consent , baseline assessment , EEG neuroimaging . - Visits 4-15 rTMS/CPT session . - Visit 16 1 month follow-up , post-treatment assessment EEG . - Visit 17 post-treatment neuroimaging visit . - Visit 18 3 month follow assessment . - Visit 19 6 month follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
