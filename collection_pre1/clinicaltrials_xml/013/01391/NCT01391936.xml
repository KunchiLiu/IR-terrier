	<brief_title>A Trial Plate Fixation Versus Tension Band Wire Olecranon Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Proximal forearm fracture comprise approximately 5 % fracture , whilst olecranon fracture account almost 20 % fracture occur around elbow1 . There limited conclusive evidence regard epidemiology , optimal treatment outcome isolate olecranon fracture . Patients undisplaced olecranon fracture treat non-operatively2,3 . The aims treatment displace olecranon fracture restoration function stability elbow joint4 . The technique employ allow preservation reconstruction articular surface minimal associate complication . Tension-band wiring ( TBW ) recognise commonly use fixation method , although plate fixation intramedullary screw fixation note alternatives2,4-10 . Potential problem TBW technique wind breakdown , infection , prominent metalwork , malunion non-union2,4,7,11-13 . Furthermore , plate fixation consider superior distal/comminuted/oblique fracture fracture-dislocations , superior fracture reduction fixation result , well low rate re-operation2,5,13,14 . There one prospective randomize trial literature compare TBW plate fixation displace olecranon fracture13 . The major conclusion study : - The functional outcome six month significantly different two group - Post-operative loss fracture reduction ( 53 % vs 5 % ) prominent symptomatic metalwork frequently observe TBW This study perform 1992 less sophisticated plate compare location specific plat currently available . Research Aim To determine difference exist outcome ( primary measure - DASH score ) one year open reduction internal fixation tension band wiring AND plate screw fixation olecranon fracture . Methodology This trial involve identify patient age 75yrs ( &lt; 75yrs ) present Edinburgh Orthopaedic Trauma Unit isolate olecranon fracture require operative intervention . Patients consent enrol trial randomise one two recognise operative fixation technique - tension band wire fixation plate fixation . The trial commence ethical approval grant Lothian Research Ethics Committee . All statistical analysis was/will perform Dr Rob Elton . Prior study power analysis determine number patient require trial . The primary outcome measure DASH score , continuous variable follow normal ( Gaussian-shaped ) distribution . This study design determine clinically relevant mean difference 10 point two cohort one year enrolment . A power analysis indicate total sample size 50 ( 25 group ) subject provide 80 % statistical power detect significant difference ( 0.05 ) DASH score , assume effect size 0.8 ( mean difference 10 point , standard deviation 12 point ) use unpaired t-test . To account possible loss follow-up 25 % , anticipate enrol 35 subject cohort total sample size 70 subject . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . All adult patient present Edinburgh Orthopaedic Trauma Unit fracture olecranon satisfy inclusion criterion invite participate study . All adult patient olecranon fracture best treat operatively eligible enrolment study regardless sex , race ethnicity . Vulnerable population recruit . A qualified member on-call team introduce study patient initiate inform consent . If patient agrees , research fellow ( Trauma Orthopaedic StR3 level ) , involve patient 's care review study protocol detail address question patient may . If patient willing participate , research fellow complete inform consent . Patients give copy consent form , informed participation voluntary withdraw time study without detriment normal care way . Patients may take long like consider participation , provide still meet eligibility criterion document . Patients willing participate study get care fracture patient decide participate study . On enrolment , data collection form start demographic injury-related information collect . Prior surgery , patient randomise ( perform Dr Rob Elton use close opaque envelope ) one two group ( tension band wire fixation plate fixation ) . Following surgery , post-operative assessment course per normal protocol patient study . Patients immobilise depend fracture fixation surgery decision make treat surgeon . Physiotherapy arrange require Follow-up All follow-up assessment take place follow-up visit initially treat consultant surgeon 's team dedicate research physiotherapist . Radiographs diagnostic study obtain discretion treat surgeon differ routine clinical care . Follow-up assessment collect one year period ( 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month one year ) . Routine follow-up institution patient sustain olecranon fracture manage operatively involves outpatient clinic review radiographs 2 week , 6 week , three month six month . Therefore , one additional visit 1 year require study additional radiograph . Radiographs perform one year clinical indication . At visit physical examination , treatment , complication re-operation ( e.g . hardware removal ) , patient record . A research physiotherapist , blind treatment method stick plaster entry position , undertake functional testing assessment . Outcome statistical method By statistically analyse outcome score two group , I aim well determine optimal management fracture age group . Using univariate analysis multivariate regression analysis I determine significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) predictor outcome relation functional outcome score ( DASH one year ) .</detailed_description>
