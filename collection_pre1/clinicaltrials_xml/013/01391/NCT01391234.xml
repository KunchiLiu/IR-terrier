	<brief_summary>The purpose research study evaluate safety effectiveness experimental workflow may result fast way plan deliver radiation treatment pain cause metastatic bone tumor ( tumor originally come another organ spread bone cause pain ) multiple myeloma ( type cancer begin white blood cell produce antibody ) . The current standard care radiation treatment planning delivery take 2 3 week start finish . The investigator develop experimental workflow : radiation treatment planning delivery workflow call `` STAT RT '' ( STAT mean `` right away '' , RT mean radiation therapy ) . This experimental workflow may shorten time take plan treat painful bone metastasis 1 week less . All step process perform within current standard care shorter time frame allow treatment start sooner . The investigator evaluate effectiveness request patient complete pain quality life questionnaire treatment . The investigator also collect additional information treatment help u make future workflow even efficient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Radiation Therapy Painful Osseous Metastatic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Osseous metastatic disease cause significant pain , decrease functioning , decrease quality life . Progressive bone destruction lead pathologic fracture spinal cord compression lead orthopedic surgery , paralysis , and/or patient become bedridden . Opioids alleviate pain neurologic gastrointestinal side effect decrease quality life . Radiation therapy effectively reduce pain opioid use prevent bone destruction , however , use limited current workflow frequently require one week plan two week delivery . Additionally , typical palliative radiation plan osseous metastasis lack conformality dose tumor volume , therefore , result radiation-induced toxicity large volume adjacent normal tissue . Recent software hardware advancement provide opportunity revolutionize palliative treatment osseous metastasis . The investigator propose investigate novel TomoTherapy-based workflow , call STAT RT , include day CT simulation , treatment planning , quality assurance measurement couple highly conformal treatment delivery patient osseous metastasis pilot clinical trial . Objective : The overall goal STAT RT proposal develop rapid , convenient , effective palliative radiation approach patient osseous metastasis less toxic less expensive current treatment regimen . The investigator already optimize conformality TomoTherapy-based radiation dose osseous metastasis , investigator develop STAT RT workflow condense standard care simulation , planning , quality assurance , treatment delivery 5-6 hour . Additional optimization integration new radiation therapy compute process allow real time simulation , planning , delivery via novel Scan-Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow ultimately require 30 minute . In study investigator evaluate effectiveness current STAT RT workflow , investigator investigate technique optimization need create 30 minute Scan-Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow . Primary Specific Aim/ Hypothesis : The investigator quantify time pain relief , amount pain relief , opioid use reduction , functional score , quality life , satisfaction patient treat STAT RT osseous metastasis . The investigator hypothesize patient rapid significant pain relief , improve quality life , high patient satisfaction . Secondary Specific Aim/ Hypothesis : The investigator optimize integration commercially available in-development software develop Scan-Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow . Specifically , investigator A ) optimize rigid deformable co-registration pre-contoured diagnostic image set MVCT simulation scan compare accuracy pre-contoured diagnostic image set co-registered kilovoltage CT ( kVCT ) simulation image kVCT simulation MVCT scan co-registration , B ) optimize CT-detector-based exit dose measurement algorithm quality assurance compare standard care phantom-based quality assurance , C ) optimize accuracy in-house real time infrared track system intrafractional patient position monitoring ensure accurate patient treatment . The investigator hypothesize new component provide effective efficient method treatment planning , quality assurance , patient position monitoring use future 30 minute Scan-Plan-Treat STAT RT workflow . Study design : The investigator recruit 30 cancer patient 1-3 painful osseous metastatic lesion ( target site ) candidate palliative radiation therapy . Patients receive 1-5 fraction 5-8 Gray ( Gy ) ( minimum biologic effective dose 25 Gy ) conformal radiation therapy deliver target site via Helical TomoTherapy system use STAT RT workflow . Data collect evaluate effectiveness novel image co-registration technique , CT-detector-based exit dose calculation , infrared patient position monitoring . These novel technique image co-registration , radiation dose calculation , patient position monitoring alter replace standard care technique . Using validated survey investigator record patient pain , analgesic use , function , quality life , patient satisfaction prior treatment 1 week , 4 week , 8 week , 12 week , 6 month , 12 month therapy . Radiation-induced treatment related toxicity capture treatment time point .</detailed_description>
