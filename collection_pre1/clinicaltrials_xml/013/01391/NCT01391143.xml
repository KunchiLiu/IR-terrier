	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety MGA271 give intravenous ( IV ) infusion patient refractory cancer . The study also evaluate long MGA271 stay blood long take leave body , high dose safely give , whether may effect tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study MGA271 Refractory Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An open-label , multi-dose , single-arm , multi-center , Phase 1 , dose-escalation study conduct define toxicity profile , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , immunogenicity , potential antitumor activity MGA271 patient refractory cancer express B7-H3 . In initial segment study , patient monitor minimum four week administration final dose MGA271 . Study assessment include adverse event ( AE ) monitoring , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) monitoring , PK analysis serum MGA271 , determination serum concentration soluble MGA271 tumor marker , assessment potential anti-MGA271 antibody [ human anti-human antibody ( HAHA ) ] response . Tumor response assessment use Study Day 43 CT scan MRI perform approximately six week first MGA271 dose patient . Patients evidence clinical benefit ( partial complete response stable disease RECIST RANO Response criterion ) allow continue therapy dose , reduce dose warrant dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) significant AE Cycle 1 . Subsequent cycle begin Study Day 50 consist MGA271 administration Study Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle , tumor evaluation every cycle . Responding patient may receive continue antibody therapy evidence progression disease document patient experience DLT . In Expansion Segment study , patient receive weekly , uninterrupted infusion initial response assessment 8 week . Tumor evaluation carry RECIST immune-related response criterion ( irRC ) .</detailed_description>
