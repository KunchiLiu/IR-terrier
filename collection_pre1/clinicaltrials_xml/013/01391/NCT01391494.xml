	<detailed_description>Hand-foot-and-mouth disease ( HFMD ) significant cause death , usually characterize vesicular lesion skin oral mucosa high morbidity rate child . Additionally , occasional fatal case report involve brainstem encephalitis myelitis associate cardiopulmonary collapse . Pulmonary edema/hemorrhage respiratory failure major cause death among child less five year old . Enterovirus 71 ( EV71 ) , major pathogen responsible cause HFMD worldwide , member Human Enterovirus species A , family Picornaviridae . Since late 1990s , series large HFMD epidemic cause EV71 report Asia-Pacific region . Notably , evidence severe case epidemic outbreak associate neurological disorder CNS involvement cause EV71 infection . Because EV71 infection-related public health issue , research development EV71 vaccine candidate heavily promote . Recently , several EV71 vaccine candidate evaluate animal final result clinical trial , include heat-inactivated formalin-inactivated vaccine , live-attenuated vaccine , recombinant viral protein 1 ( VP1 ) vaccine , VP1 DNA vaccine , VP1 epitope peptide vaccine , EV71 virus-like particle ( VLPs ) bacterial viral vector express VP1 . Overall , inactivate whole-virus vaccine seem immunogenic recombinant VP1 DNA vaccine . Basing previous study elicit protection mouse rhesus monkey ( Ying Zhang , et al .
