	<brief_title>Response Shift Sinus Surgery Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction The common goal functional endoscopic sinus surgery ( FESS ) improve quality life ( QOL ) . Changes QOL treatment effect measure use validated instrument complete patient . One 's perception QOL often dynamic experience show affected current medical emotional state . This phenomenon know response shift QOL research measure use Then-test . This test ask patient complete pre-operative survey symptom post-operative period . This test aim characterize change one 's perception pre-operative condition . The aim study assess significance response shift sinus surgery outcomes measure use sino-nasal outcome test ( SNOT-20 ) , validate questionnaire use assess severity symptom relate chronic rhinosinusitis . Methods This prospective cohort study approve University Washington IRB . We approach patient underwent FESS chronic rhinosinusitis 2010-2012 complete pre-operative SNOT-20 . We aim recruit 30 patient . Patients mail 2 SNOT-20 form transition QOL scale least 6 month surgery . Patients instruct complete 1 SNOT-20 accord pre-operative symptom ( then-test ) accord post-operative symptom . The difference pre- post-operative SNOT-20 calculate represent treatment effect , difference pre-operative SNOT-20 then-test represent response shift . A student t-test use compare difference . Results A total 32 complete response obtain . Using 0 5 SNOT-20 scale , average treatment effect -0.96 ( p=0.00 ) average response shift +0.42 ( p=0.01 ) . The negative treatment effect signifies improvement QOL . The positive response shift signifies average , patient think even symptomatic prior surgery . The actual treatment effect sum treatment effect response shift -1.38 . Discussion Response shift exists quantify FESS outcome . The actual treatment effect profound take account response shift , therefore future study account often unmeasured , potential change QOL .</detailed_description>
