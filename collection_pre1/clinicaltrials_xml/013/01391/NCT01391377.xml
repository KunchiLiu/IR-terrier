	<brief_summary>Atherosclerosis disorder body characterize cholesterol plaque formation various artery , cause narrow artery limitation blood flow . Depending artery plaque , different clinical condition occur . In adults common area include heart artery , neck artery aorta low leg artery . When affect low limb know peripheral arterial disease - PAD . The main symptom PAD call `` claudication '' describe pain discomfort leg walk . The aim PAD treatment improve walk distance quality life intermittent claudication , decrease long term complication include illness death . An important controlling factor cholesterol plaques type cholesterol call HDL ( High density lipoprotein ) . This study aim look effect raise HDL prolonged period blood marker inflammation cholesterol plaque composition patient PAD . This investigation also relevance effect HDL elevation plaque composition inflammation area body include heart , neck brain artery . Twenty ( 20 ) PAD patient recruit study . The investigator anticipate recruitment 20 patient within 12 month . The 20 PAD patient must significant leg pain walk , review doctor , determine narrowing leg artery plan operate . Patients randomize either niacin ( Tredaptive , 1g/day ) match placebo 8 week ( prior operation ) After 8 week period go receive normal interventional treatment plan . Blood sample take enrollment 8 week mark prior surgery . The plaque remove time operation also send lab analysis . The investigator hope show study raise level HDL extend release niacin , positive effect amount cholesterol plaque , marker blood inflammation thrombosis . The hypothesis elevation HDL Niacin anti-atherosclerotic action include : Lower plaque lipid content , Reduced plaque macrophage infiltration , Reduced monocyte activation , Reduced neutrophil adhesion , Inhibition inflammation Inhibition thrombotic marker .</brief_summary>
