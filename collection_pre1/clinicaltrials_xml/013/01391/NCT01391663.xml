	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics Pharmacodynamics Study Alogliptin Healthy Korean Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alogliptin selective , orally available inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 developed Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center , Inc. treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus . Inhibition dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) prolong action 2 important incretin hormone , glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide ( GIP ) . These hormone responsible increase insulin synthesis , regulate β-cell proliferation , inhibit gastric empty inhibit glucagon secretion . Evaluations alogliptin clinical efficacy conduct multiple country include United States Japan . As development alogliptin expand country , additional study need bridge data previously acquire . The main objective study ass pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics alogliptin healthy Korean participant .</detailed_description>
