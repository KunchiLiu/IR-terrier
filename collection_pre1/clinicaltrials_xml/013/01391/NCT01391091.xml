	<brief_title>Effect Catheter Ablation Clinical Course Migraine AF Patients With Without Previous History Migraine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine , neurovascular disorder affect approximately 12 % world population , characterize recurrent attack incapacitate headache associate photophobia , phonophobia , nausea vomiting ( 1 ) . Although pathogenesis migraine clearly understood yet , widely accept caused cerebral vasodilatation , abnormal neurological firing and/or neurogenic dural inflammation ( 1 ) . Additionally , recent study demonstrate association migraine aura intracardiac shunt patent foramen ovale ( PFO ) lead hypothesis paradoxical brain embolism platelet undefined chemical substance play causal role migraine aura ( 2 ) . Radiofrequency catheter ablation ( RFCA ) show promising treatment cardiac arrhythmia . During catheter ablation , trans-septal puncture ( TSP ) routinely perform gain access leave heart . TSP cause iatrogenic atrial septal defect ( ASD ) transient right-to-left shunt predispose patient stroke migraine ( 3 ) . In two different study , 571 183 patient TSP perform , incidence migraine 0.5 % 2.2 % respectively migraine transient resolve without sequela ( 2 , 3 ) . In separate study , complete resolution improvement migraine notice ASD/PFO closure ( 4 ) . Additional case-studies also report AF occur episode migraine aura cardiac rhythm normal episode ( 5 ) . All report evidently demonstrate association AF , TSP RFCA migraine , fail clearly define nature . It yet understand whether successful catheter ablation AF impact natural course pre-existing newly-occurring migraine . This study aim explore relationship AF migraine evaluate effective ablation therapy AF influence incidence clinical presentation migraine patient without previous history . Several isolated case-studies report improvement frequency severity migraine treatment Coumadin ( 6 , 7 ) . Coumadin routinely prescribe patient undergo RFCA prevent thrombo-embolic event . Our study would explore impact therapeutic Coumadin prevalence clinical course migraine patient previous history . Hypothesis : Catheter ablation affect disease course migraine AF patient without previous history migraine .</detailed_description>
