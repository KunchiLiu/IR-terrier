	<brief_summary>You invite participate research study develop new way look abnormal areas/tissues esophagus . The current endoscope use look esophagus good , area n't look different naked eye , endoscope ca n't improve . The investigator look use special fluorescent stain addition special endoscope design see abnormal area obvious naked eye . Currently specialize microscope fluorescent stain use clinical laboratory take several day process get result . It may helpful look area sample abnormal tissue endoscopy procedure . You ask let u use `` fluorescent peptide '' special endoscope allow u `` see '' esophagus fluorescent white light upper GI endoscopy procedure help target biopsy . Peptides small chain amino acid ( build block make protein ) link together . Our peptide chain 7 amino acid attach fluorescent dye call FITC ( like one use eye doctor ) . The investigator prepare special `` fluorescent peptide '' , `` glow '' special light use help u separate normal tissue abnormal tissue . In study , investigator apply special fluorescent peptide spray catheter esophagus help u target biopsy . Both routine target biopsy take endoscopist feel indicate . This phase 1 study . This mean first time investigator use kind `` fluorescent peptide '' people . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve agent , allow u test study . The main goal study see side effect use peptide . Our second goal see peptide `` glow '' well investigator take picture area glow . This first test agent , wo n't use change biopsy take endoscopy do .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SUMMARY OF STUDY PLAN A Phase I study safety topically-administered 7-amino acid peptide fluorescein analog ( 5-FITC ) label detect neoplastic area esophagus propose . The study test safety administer agent ( 5-FITC-labeled 7-AA peptide ) human subject undergo clinically-indicated upper endoscopy and/or endoscopic ultrasound suspected esophageal adenocarcinoma without Barrett 's Esophagus High-Grade dysplasia ( HGD ) Barrett 's Esophagus . We intend enroll 25 evaluable subject . We expect able enroll 5 subject per month , study take 6-9 month complete . Subjects recruit around scheduled procedure . The endoscopists perform procedure investigator protocol FDA form 1572 . Blood clinical lab urine dipstick urinanalysis ( pregnancy test , applicable ) collect pre-procedure , along medical information . Vital sign monitor throughout clinical procedure capture case report form , separate physical exam necessary . The endoscopy proceed per UMHS ( University Michigan Health System ) standard care guideline management Barrett 's Esophagus ( American College Gastroenterology , Appendix C ) . The endoscopist perform clinical procedure evaluate potential risk ( ) patient continue procedure study . The endoscopist spray reconstitute 5-FITC-labeled peptide onto esophageal mucosa catheter endoscope . Pictures white-light take standard endoscope peptide application . The Mauna Kea/Cellvizio® miniprobe , FDA approve instrument ( 510 ( k ) ref # K051585 ) pass instrument channel standard endoscope use collect confocal image two area peptide bind . Biopsies take clinically indicated , include two place confocal image take . Data clinical biopsy collect case report form . All biopsy clinical care ( research use ) send routine histology per UMHS standard care . Approximately 24 hour ( ± 4 hour ) post-procedure , blood clinical lab urine dipstick urinanalysis ( UA ) collect assess potential effect ( ) apply peptide solution . Subjects receive compensation inconvenience return another blood draw . Subjects may able blood UA do UMHS lab QUEST Diagnostics Lab closer home Subjects receive compensation inconvenience return another blood draw . Subjects may able blood UA do UMHS lab QUEST Diagnostics Lab closer home orby Michigan Clinical Research Unit ( MCRU 2U ) . Additional blood draw follow lab may need significant difference baseline see . Additional compensation offer blood draw .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects biopsyproven suspect highgrade dysplasia esophageal adenocarcinoma without confirm Barrett 's Esophagus . Subjects schedule clinicallyindicated upper endoscopic evaluation and/or intervention ( e.g . esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) biopsy ) . All subject medically clear procedure ( e.g . washout anticoagulant , comorbidities ) meet inclusion/exclusion include . Standard practice guideline safely proceed procedure sufficient study . Adults age 18 year 100 year old . Willing able sign inform consent . The effect 5FITClabeled peptide develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test day procedure receive 5FITClabeled peptide agent postmenopausal . Postmenopausal woman define posthysterectomy , 40 least 18 month without menses birthcontrol . Subjects know allergy negative reaction fluorescein derivative . Subjects esophagectomy . Subjects also prepped colonoscopy EGD . Subjects active chemotherapy radiation treatment .</criteria>
