	<brief_summary>This study compare effect oral pregabalin placebo postoperative pain morphine usage mastectomy . Pregabalin anticonvulsant agent approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment neuropathic pain associate post-herpetic neuralgia diabetic neuropathy . Women 18-70 year age , undergoing unilateral modify mastectomy lumpectomy axillary node dissection recruit participate study . Patients unable cooperative , know allergy pregabalin morphine history drug alcohol abuse , chronic pain , history daily intake analgesic steroid , impaired kidney function exclude study . A pregnancy test also perform exclude pregnant woman study . Oral pregabalin 300 mg ( placebo ) administer patient 1-2 hour surgery follow 150 mg 12 hour later . Thereafter , 150 mg oral pregabalin ( placebo ) administer twice daily day 14 . Whether patient receives pregabalin placebo decide base process similar tossing coin . Patients receive standard general anesthetic operation receive intravenous patient-controlled analgesia ( PCA ) morphine pain immediate postoperative period . Oral opioids administer discontinuation PCA . Subjects visit operation hospital intermittently three month outpatient clinic discharge hospital . Subjects asked return remain study drug/empty container hospital 2 week follow visit . Potential adverse effect pregabalin include dizziness , somnolence , peripheral edema , weight gain , headache , dry mouth , blurry vision , ataxia . The incidence side effect occur range variously 1 25 % . Investigators closely monitor patient occurrence side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TITLE : The Effects Oral Pregabalin versus Placebo Postoperative Pain Morphine Consumption Mastectomy INVESTIGATOR : Babatunde O. Ogunnaike , MD . Department Anesthesiology Pain Management , University Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas , Texas RATIONALE : In recent year , persistent pain surgical procedure recognize major factor delay recovery return normal daily living . Long-lasting pain report numerous surgical procedure include mastectomy . The prevalence persistent post-mastectomy pain quote anywhere 40 % 80 % may substantially impact life patient treat cancer ( Smith et al . Pain 1999 ; 83 : 91-5 ) . Peripheral central sensitization tissue nerve injury implicate development intractable pain potentially become chronic ( Joshi &amp; Ogunnaike , Anesthesiology Clin N Am 2005 ; 23 : 21-36 ) Gabapentin , anticonvulsant widely use treatment chronic pain , show decrease neuropathic pain ( Rice &amp; Maton , Pain 2001 ; 94 : 215-24 ) Dirks et al . ( Anesthesiology 2002 ; 97 : 560 ) report gabapentin 1200 mg prior surgery reduce postoperative morphine requirement movement-related pain radical mastectomy . However , immediate well long-term benefit drug evaluate study . Fassoulaki et al . ( Anesth Analg 2002 ; 95 : 985-91 ) also observe pain rest movement pain reduce gabapentin early postoperative period . Pregabalin new anticonvulsant agent recently approve FDA treatment neuropathic pain associate post-herpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) [ Gajraj NM . Pain Practice 2005 ; 5 : 95-102 ] . This study design evaluate analgesic efficacy pregabalin mastectomy . OBJECTIVES : Primary : To evaluate effect pregabalin postoperative opioid requirement opioid-related side effect Secondary : To evaluate effect pregabalin pain score 3 month mastectomy . INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Women 18-70 year age 2 . American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status I III 3 . Undergoing unilateral modify radical mastectomy lumpectomy axillary node dissection EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients unable cooperate 2 . Allergy pregabalin morphine 3 . History drug alcohol abuse 4 . Chronic pain 5 . Daily intake analgesic steroids 6 . Impaired kidney function OTHER THERAPY : IV-PCA morphine rescue pain management immediate postoperative period oral opioids discontinuation IV-PCA . Patients start morphine PCA dose 1 mg every 10 minute maximum possible total dose 6 mg per hour . This dose morphine increase discretion treat physician . Transition oral opioid hydrocodone/acetaminophen ( 5 mg/500 mg ) begin 8 postoperative day 1 dose 1 tablet every 4 hour need pain . Total dose morphine total number tablet hydrocodone/acetaminophen record immediately prior discharge . STUDY DESIGN : Phase III , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . STUDY DRUG REGIMENS : Oral pregabalin 300mg ( placebo ) administer patient 1-2 hour surgery follow 150mg 12 hour later . Thereafter , 150mg oral pregabalin ( placebo ) administer twice daily day 14 . DURATION OF STUDY : Patients follow 3 month ( 90 day ) VISIT FREQUENCY : Patients visit daily hospital follow daily postoperatively via telephone 1 week thereafter postoperative day 14 , 30 , 90 approximately . After discharge home , patient contact telephone record pain assessment . The patient ask return remain study/drug empty container hospital come 2 week follow visit surgery oncology clinic . SAMPLE SIZE : Based previous study , 30 % reduction opioid use consider clinically relevant , type 1 error 5 % power 90 % , 40 patient require study group . EFFICACY MEASURES : 1 . Pain score ( VAS ) categorical 2 . Morphine consumption ( IV-PCA oral opioid dosage ) 3 . Side effect rat use symptom distress questionnaire , include measure frequency , intensity , bothersomeness evaluate four-point verbal scale ( none , mild , moderate , severe ) . 4 . Modified Brief Pain Inventory - short form ( mBPI - sf ) PATIENT SAFETY PROCESS AND MONITORING : Safety assessment would include monitoring adverse event , occurrence , nature , intensity , relationship study drug . Clinical experience group-related drug ( gabapentin ) result clinical trial pregabalin support notion pregabalin well tolerate minimal side effect include , headache , dizziness , somnolence , blur vision , weight gain , peripheral edema . Patients would specifically questioned side effect unanticipated occurrence clinic visit telephone . Patients would advise avoid consumption alcohol may potentiate sedative effect pregabalin . Patients may central nervous system depressant opiates benzodiazepine would inform may experience additive central nervous system ( CNS ) effect somnolence . Patient may become pregnant advised notify investigator may remove study . REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS Definition An adverse event condition , appear worsens participation study . All adverse event note Adverse Reaction Case Report Form , whether felt relate trial activity . Severity Whenever possible adverse event grade numerical score accord define Toxicity Grading Scale ( NCI 's Common Toxicity Criteria ) . Adverse event include defined toxicity Grading Scale score Adverse Reaction CRF accord impact subject 's ability perform daily activity follow : Mild ( cause limitation usual activity ) Grade 1 Moderate ( cause limitation usual activity ) Grade 2 Severe ( cause inability carry usual activity ) Grade 3 Serious Adverse Events International Conference Harmonisation ( ICH ) Guideline E6 define serious adverse event event meet follow criterion : - Fatal - Immediately life-threatening - Results inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization - Results persistent significant disability/incapacity - Results congenital anomaly/birth defect Follow-up All adverse event follow accord good medical practice . Adverse Event Reporting All adverse experience occur participation trial report Adverse Reaction form subject 's Clinical Research File ( CRF ) binder . The nature adverse event , date time onset , outcome , intensity action take establish . Details corrective treatment record appropriate page CRF binder . Any adverse event serious unexpected report within two day Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center Data Safety Monitoring Committee , UT Southwestern Institutional Review Board , UTSW Medical Risk Management Office , Study Sponsor ( DoD ) .
