	<brief_title>The Impact Preoperative Breast MRI Patients With Breast Cancer Selected Breast Conserving Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study evaluate impact preoperative breast MRI primary surgical treatment highly specialized multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic . The clinic serf population 237.000 . The diagnostic tool routinely use conventional mammography , ultrasound core needle biopsy , clinical examination include palpation breast axillary node . If indicate , examination include ultrasound examination fine needle biopsy axillary gland . We offer patient select breast-conserving surgery preoperative breast MRI . We include consecutively breast cancer lesion woman age 35-75 prospective study , collect data January 2009 December 2010 . The patient select breast-conserving surgery base criterion recommend Norwegian Breast Cancer Group . That , tumor ≤ 4 cm , acceptable tumor : breast ratio , age &gt; 35 . Multifocal lesion , define one tumor &gt; 1 cm apart , size tumor &gt; 4 cm , large tumor : breast ratio , extensive ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) , know genetic disposition breast cancer , indicate mastectomy accord criterias . In addition , postoperative radiation therapy contraindicate , mastectomy indicate . If patient fill criterion breast-conserving surgery , offer preoperative breast MRI include study . Patients either choose mastectomy , get breast MRI technical reason , exclude study . Two experience breast radiologist evaluate breast MRIs , three experience breast radiologist study mammography perform ultrasound examination biopsy . All additional MRI finding examine ultrasound-guided biopsy give histological diagnose influence surgical method . A formal application present regional ethical commitee . Since observational study establish practice , commitee reply approval require .</detailed_description>
