Patients must histologically confirm metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma curable surgery . Diagnosis malignancy must confirm department pathology institution patient enrol prior patient enrollment . Patients must show evidence objective disease progression per RECIST 1 scan within 6 month period immediately precede enrollment . Both scan use determine disease progression obtain within 6month period . Patients newly diagnose , unresectable , metastatic , measurable ASPS show clinical evidence disease progression ( include history increase physical symptom ) also eligible . Onstudy documentation include physician rationale support evidence clinical disease progression ( i.e. , increase tumor pain ) .
