	<brief_summary>When woman require cesarean section labour , anesthesia usually provide pre-existing epidural . Occasionally , epidural work . The anesthesiologist may give `` spinal anesthetic '' . The spinal space identify see cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) spinal needle . Rarely spinal fails fail epidural fluid see epidural space fluid , CSF . This study plan use bedside glucose monitor measure glucose ( sugar ) epidural fluid ( compare CSF ) allow anesthesiologist know spinal needle correct space . The investigator hypothesize bedside glucose measurement device accurately quantitate level glucose within epidural space aspirate , therefore could aid differentiation CSF epidural fluid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It would clinically useful bedside test confirm fluid obtain insertion spinal needle follow fail epidural , fact , CSF prior injection local anesthetic . This test also may decrease probability fail spinal follow failed epidural top , therefore avoid risk general anesthesia parturient . When cesarean delivery require follow trial labour , epidural catheter situ use provide surgical anesthesia . A large volume ( 10-20 milliliter ) local anesthetic administer epidural catheter . This aim produce dense nerve block T4 ( nipple level ) , sufficient low abdominal surgery . Occasionally , however , technique provide adequate anesthesia surgical intervention - term 'failed epidural top-up ' - estimate occur 38 % time . Options follow failure epidural top-up dependent urgency delivery , include either general anesthetic intrathecal injection local anesthetic ( 'spinal ' ) . The preferred choice mother baby , time allows , normally consider spinal . A spinal performed insert needle subarachnoid space surround epidural space . The subarachnoid space contains CSF , spinal cord exit nerve spinal cord . The anesthesiologist identifies subarachnoid space obtain CSF needle . Local anesthetic inject directly space . Rarely , spinal anesthesia may fail administer follow failed epidural , several theory may occur . One possible reason spinal failure large volume local anesthetic , injected epidural catheter cesarean delivery anesthesia , cause subarachnoid space collapse , make difficult access needle obtain CSF . Another theory fail spinal anesthesia involve misidentification clear fluid return spinal needle . It postulate circumstance fluid see CSF . It may tissue fluid epidural space ( transudate ) , local anesthetic inject epidural space combination two . In case , needle subarachnoid space , therefore , spinal anesthesia fail . Anatomical variation , congenital arachnoid cyst , may also contribute failed spinal follow failed epidural top ups . Various bedside test describe confirm whether fluid exit needle CSF , include analyze fluid 's temperature , density , pH , glucose content whether precipitated thiopental ( alkaline solution ) . Whilst single test completely effective , measurement glucose seem best indicator . Glucose think good discriminator fluid obtain spinal different proportion glucose clear fluid could return spinal needle . The level glucose CSF usually approximately 2/3 plasma glucose ( approximately 2-4mmol/L ) . There minimal glucose fluid draw epidural space . However , previous study show small amount glucose may present epidural space 30 minute epidural catheter insertion . Potential source glucose epidural space may blood , CSF transudate . In past , presence glucose do use simple reagent strip , rapid ( 2 minute ) accurate ( compare laboratory value test ) , however , solely detect either presence absence glucose . As may small amount glucose present epidural space , use reagent strip may distinguish epidural fluid CSF . A glucose meter give absolute value glucose , may useful . Even though epidural fluid may contain glucose , absolute value would significantly lower see CSF glucose . The range normal CSF glucose parturient confirm use bedside glucose meter Sweet CSF Study 2-4 mmol/L . In previous study compare efficacy , accuracy ease use three glucose meter use measure CSF glucose.1 The CSF glucose level compare result laboratory measurement glucose . This study take place January - November , 2010 BC Women 's Hospital Vancouver , British Columbia . The study establish feasibility measure CSF glucose measure three glucose meter , two meter , verify commonly accept normal range parturients elective cesarean delivery spinal anesthesia . Now obtained value , aim see glucose level epidural space fluid ( via epidural catheter ) differ CSF use one previously test bedside monitor . We also aim distinguish level glucose fluid return needle spinal do follow failed epidural . Labouring woman admit BC Women 's assessed eligibility study . Women receive epidural labour analgesia approach investigator explain project answer question study . Written information regard aim practicality study give woman . Informed consent obtain follow decision proceed cesarean delivery . Women approach consent participate time surgery . The study delay surgery interfere routine standard care .</detailed_description>
