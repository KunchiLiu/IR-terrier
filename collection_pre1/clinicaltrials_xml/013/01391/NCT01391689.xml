	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess change breast density use mammogram-based breast density measure well novel , quantitative fat-water ratio breast magnetic resonance imaging ( FWR-MRI ) . II . Evaluate effect escalate daily dose DIM serum steroid hormone ( estrogen , sex hormone bind globulin [ SHBG ] ) urinary 2-hydroxyestrone:16 alpha-hydroxyestrone ( 2OHE1:16 alpha OHE1 ) ratio well serum tamoxifen ( TAM ) metabolites ( endoxifen ) . The study initiate dose 75 mg twice daily ( BID ) ( total daily dose 150 mg ) first 10 study participant dose escalated 150 mg DIM BID ( total daily dose 300 mg ) treatment-related serious adverse event ( SAEs ) report initial 10 subject thru 3 month treatment . III . Expand currently available toxicity safety DIM-TAM combination assess report treatment associate side effects/adverse event include TAM-associated endometrial toxicity ( self-reported vaginal bleeding pattern physician order vaginal ultrasound ) , chemistry profile , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Endocrine Subscale ( FACT-ES ) score standard Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) track . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Collect fine-needle aspiration breast tissue sample ( subset ) blood sample ( participant ) order explore change mammary gland tissue architecture cellularity ; tissue marker association change breast density explore change biomarkers disease risk ( e.g . cyclooxygenase-2 [ COX-2 ] , deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] adduct , oxidative stress , inflammation , etc ) time ( pre post treatment ) study arm . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive diindolylmethane orally ( PO ) BID approximately 36 month . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID approximately 36 month . In arm , treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
