	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SAR125844 . To confirm safety profile SAR125844 administer single agent MTD . To evaluate preliminary anti-tumoral effect SAR125844 patient MET-gene amplify solid tumor ( include sub-group MET-amplified non-small cell lung cancer [ NSCLC ] patient ) patient Phospho-MET positive tumor without MET-gene amplification . Secondary Objectives : To characterize global safety profile include cumulative toxicity . To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile SAR125844 propose dose schedule ( ) . To assess preliminary antitumor activity patient measurable/evaluable disease , accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . To explore pharmacodynamic effect ( PD ) SAR125844 . To explore MET gene amplification status Circulating Tumoral Cells ( CTCs ) tumor biopsy collect study , escalation part . To evaluate pharmacodynamic biomarkers help selection patient could benefit SAR125844 . To explore MET-gene amplification status circulate DNA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study SAR125844 Single Agent Administered Slow Intravenous Infusion Adult Patients With Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The duration study one patient dose escalation phase study include screen period 3 week 4-week treatment cycle ( ) . The patient may continue treatment disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , willingness stop , follow minimum 30-day follow-up . The study also include 2 expansion cohort . If patient treat dose escalation part expansion cohort , continue benefit treatment time Clinical Study Report , patient continue study treatment maximum 1 year continue undergo assessment per study flowchart . Such patient follow least 30 day last IMP administration .</detailed_description>
