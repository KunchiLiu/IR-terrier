	<brief_summary>The purpose study test hypothesis combination simvastatin zoledronic acid ( reversal drug resistance ) , bortezomib , high-dose methylprednisolone bendamustine day 1,8 schedule ( reduce toxicity ) effective well-tolerated treatment relapse refractory multiple myeloma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Simvastatin Relapsed/Refractory Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Primary To estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) ( complete response ( CR ) + good partial response ( VGPR ) + partial response ( PR ) ) patient multiple myeloma relapse refractory bortezomib treatment receive combination therapy simvastatin , zoledronic acid , bortezomib , bendamustine methylprednisolone . To evaluate safety tolerability study therapy . Secondary 1 . To estimate progression-free Survival ( PFS ) , time progression ( TTP ) , overall survival ( OS ) duration response ( DOR ) . 2 . To describe toxicity ( frequency severity ) treatment . 3 To estimate clinical benefit response ( CBR ) ( ORR + minor response ( MR ) ) stable disease ( SD ) . 4 Explore factor associate ORR , PFS , OS , toxicity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must diagnosis Multiple Myeloma ( use International Myeloma Working Group Guidelines ) Patients must fail least one prior treatment regimen contain bortezomib . They may refractory primary therapy relapse measurable assessable disease . ( Refractory disease define anything less PR progression within 60 day complete therapy . ) Patients Multiple Myeloma must measurable active , progressive symptomatic disease . Measurable disease may paraprotein free light chain serum urine , presence bone marrow plasma cell . Age must least 18 year age . Prior therapy may include bendamustine , bortezomib , methylprednisolone , radiation , autologous hematopoietic cell transplant . Patients receive therapy must least 4 week beyond prior chemotherapy ( exclude corticosteroid ) . If female patient reproductive capacity : effective mean birth control entire duration treatment . Patients must recover acute toxicity result therapy administer prior enter study grade 1 less . Alopecia may resolve . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Life expectancy great 8 week . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 , 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ; see Appendix A ) . Patients must adequate bone marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 500/ul platelet &gt; 30,000/ul Patients must adequate liver function define : total bilirubin &lt; 2 time upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 3 x upper limit normal Patients must adequate renal function define creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min ( measure estimate CockcroftGault formula ) . Patients must sign significant rhabdomyolysis determine CPK level CK &lt; 5 time upper limit normal . Patients receive chemotherapy treatment multiple myeloma prior enrol study . Patients receive simvastatin ( dose &gt; 40 mg/day ) , equivalent dose another statin ) last prior chemotherapy multiple myeloma . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients receive investigational agent ( ) . Active second malignancy last 5 year except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinomainsitu . History hypersensitivity reaction attribute simvastatin , bortezomib , bendamustine zoledronic acid . Pregnant woman ineligible , treatment involve unforeseeable risk embryo fetus . Patients receive medication may increase risk rhabdomyolysis itraconazole , ketoconazole , erythromycin , cyclosporine , amiodarone , verapamil , niacin , HIV protease inhibitor . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , myopathy , untreated hypothyroidism , hereditary myopathy family history , unstable angina pectoris , liver disease due multiple myeloma , cardiac arrhythmia symptomatic rate control , active connective tissue disease , active autoimmune disease , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
