	<brief_summary>This study investigate influence several simulate real life condition symmetry gait trans-tibial prosthesis Hypotheses : It hypothesize observable difference gait pattern amputee detect combination force moment measure internally prosthesis , electromyography data . It hypothesize change condition uneven walk surface , prosthetic misalignment user fatigue characterize typical value measure data combination thereof .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In amputee walking , optimal static alignment artificial leg important order achieve best possible performance . Comfort , energy expenditure , mobility walk speed ideally similar able bodied person . Of course , amputation level , overall health status factor often pose certain individual limitation may prevent amputee reach goal . Irrespective , artificial leg must align properly eliminate unnecessary inhibition . Apart manufacture well fit socket , select appropriate functional component prosthesis , prosthetist routinely optimize static alignment fit process . Hereby , objective measure guideline scarce . Despite various less useful tool available , alignment optimization praxis often base subjective gait assessment rule thumb . Commonly accepted notion , gait pattern symmetrically , step length , stance time , knee angle etc . identical sound prosthetic leg . There different question study want address : Is gait symmetry indeed valid measure prosthetic performance ( e.i . energy efficient way walk ) ? How gait pattern change prosthesis user walk different surface , becomes tired try compensate less-than-optimal prosthesis fit ? How gait symmetry objectively assess without use expensive motion analysis laboratory ? We hope finding provide practically useful information help improve prosthetic fitting field . The study base data 15 trans-tibial prosthesis user . Participants walk standard prosthesis , equip small sensor unit measurement force moment walk . The muscle activity thigh muscle measure use surface EMG sensor . All data collection take place USR facility ( 115 E Reindl Way , Milwaukee ) , multi camera motion analysis system set . Trials require overall time commitment 5 hour , include normal walking , walk carpet gravel , walk stair , walk fatigue thigh muscle .</detailed_description>
