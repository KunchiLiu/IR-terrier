	<brief_summary>This phase I pilot study aim define safety combine treatment bevacizumab whole brain radiation therapy treatment patient brain metastasis solid tumor . If therapeutic scheme confirms 's safety profile , investigator expect : - first , allow patient receive bevacizumab advance and/or metastatic cancer necessary , even case brain metastasis . - Secondly , trial confirm synergic effect combination angiogenesis inhibitor brain radiotherapy local control brain metastasis , improvement therapeutic result patient poor hope survival none innovative approach currently suggest . Moreover , investigator hope analysis different data MRI evaluation - morphological functional - allow good definition radiological evaluation therapeutic effect angiogenesis inhibitor brain metastasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Evaluation Combination Brain Radiation Therapy Bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) Treatment Brain Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain metastasis remain common complication many solid tumor , occur 10 20 % patient cancer , incidence may arise 20-40 % autopsy series . Despite treatment , patient outcome poor brain metastasis become major cause death cancer . Some recent study show increase incidence brain metastasis ; several explanation evocated : - The increased efficacy brain image screen brain metastasis . - The relative long life expectancy cancer patient correlation efficient therapy ( new chemotherapy drug , target therapy ) visceral bone metastasis , without effect risk brain metastasis ( sanctuary effect ) , Therapeutic management brain metastasis : standard care improvement strategy For patient poor survival hope , treatment limit best supportive care palliative intent . At opposite , specific treatment brain metastasis must propose real benefit may expect . Surgery radiosurgery indicate limited brain involvement ( 1 3 metastasis ) . In case multiple localisation , whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) common approach ; however treatment realize palliative intent : control neurological symptom brain oedema . In literature , objective response rate 50-60 % expect WBRT , majority patient relapse died brain metastasis , median survival time 4 6 month . Considering poor result , seem crucial develop innovative strategy , order improve survival hope patient . Different concomitant approach test association WBRT ( cytotoxics temozolomide , radio-sensitizers efaproxiral ) , recently combination radiation therapy therapy target different signal pathway develop , example lapatinib HER2 pathway . Targeted therapy act neoangiogenesis seem also may consider interesting axis research . Rationale utilisation angiogenesis inhibitor treatment brain metastasis Neo-angiogenesis play important role growth brain metastasis , act different mechanism tumor neo-angiogenesis ( development new blood vessel ) , co-option exist blood vessel increase vascular permeability . Therefore , angiogenesis inhibitor , particularly agent target VEGF/VEGFR pathway , could interest treatment brain metastasis . In pre-clinical model , VEGF best characterize mediator angiogenesis , role point development brain metastasis : increase transmigration tumor cell blood-brain barrier VEGF-dependent disrupting effect , anti-apoptotic effect VEGF paracrine action . This data suggest therapeutic effect VEGF target agent brain metastasis decrease brain metastasis development observe anti-VEGF anti-sens therapy . Moreover , VEGF involve vascular permeability mechanism important development peri-tumoral oedema . Anti-angiogenic treatment divide two group : one hand , angiogenesis inhibitor ( act normalization exist tumor vascularisation decrease formation new blood vessel ) hand , vascular disrupt agent ( destroy pathologic vessel ) . For brain tumor , study focus role angiogenesis inhibitor . Of special interest , anti-VEGF therapy , particularly bevacizumab , test clinical setting . Bevacizumab , monoclonal recombinant antibody target VEGF , prevent fixation VEGF VEGF receptor 1 2 endothelial cell , neutralize effect VEGF action . In clinic , recent study show significant benefit bevacizumab ( Avastin® ) treatment primary brain tumor , show Vredenburgh et al . patient recurrent glioma ; data confirm synergic effect chemotherapy . Similarly , potential synergic action combine approach radiation therapy seem interesting therapeutic way . Rationale combine angiogenesis inhibitor radiation therapy In tumor , pathologic neo-angiogenesis reduces diffusion oxygen , consequently promote hypoxia . Hypoxia one cause radio-resistance . Ionizing radiation induce transient hypoxia central area tumor , increase production VEGF consequently neo-angiogenesis . This `` vicious circle '' allow development optimal condition radio-resistance . The normalization pathologic vessel induce angiogenesis inhibitor lead decrease hypoxia thus enhance radio-sensitivity tumor cell endothelial cell . In clinical setting , study publish treatment combine radiation therapy angiogenic inhibitor . The main study conduct rectal carcinoma ( 9 ) , show safety profile combine scheme bevacizumab capecitabine association pre-operative pelvic irradiation . Efficacy data encouraging ( downstaging 9 /11 patient , histological regression 5 patient ) . Similar conclusion may draw another study perform patient unresectable pancreatic carcinoma treat radio-chemotherapy include bevacizumab , lead objective response 9 patient ( 20 % ) , 4 operable end radio-chemotherapy . Interestingly , combine approach seem interesting brain tumor , show recent publish trial conduct Narayana first-line treatment glioma . This phase 2 study combine temozolomide chemotherapy bevacizumab administration dose 10 m/kg D14 D28 course radiotherapy ( total dose 59,40 Gy deliver tumor volume ) . An promising response rate observe : 7 % complete response 93 % partial response , 1-year progression-free survival 59,3 % . The author confirm feasibility combine approach ( 13/15 patient complete treatment ) . Three grade 3-4 haematological toxicity 4 non-haematological toxicity ( thrombo-embolism HTA ) relate . None intracerebral hemorrhage death relate treatment report . These result indicate possible way innovative strategy therapeutic management brain metastasis , association bevacizumab whole brain radiation therapy . Furthermore , bevacizumab indicate several advanced and/or metastatic cancer administration remain theorically contra-indicated patient brain metastasis , due fear potential cerebral hemorrhage . However , risk remains low , show several study . Safety data record glioblastoma reassuring , however , essential determine optimal dose level bevacizumab combine irradiation entire brain dose 30 Gy Thus phase 1 pilot study plan carry , important test several dose level bevacizumab combination irradiation brain : precaution decide use conventional fractionation 15 Gy 2 fraction three week . Secondarily , give good tolerability modality combination three level dose bevacizumab use , propose continue phase 1 accord scheme commonly use palliative situation ( 30 Gy 10 fraction 2 week ) combination Avastin dose 15 mg / kg , maximum limit toxicity observe .</detailed_description>
