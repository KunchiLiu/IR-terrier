	<brief_title>TPI 287 Breast Cancer Metastatic Brain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Study Drug : TPI-287 design prevent cancer cell divide , may slow and/or stop growth cancer cell . Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive , TPI 287 vein 60 minute Day 1 every 21 day cycle . Before receive study drug , receive dexamethasone mouth , Benadryl ( diphenhydramine HCL ) vein 30-60 minute , ranitidine 30-60 minute help prevent potential serious allergic reaction . Study Visits : At study visit , ask side effect may drug may take . On Days 1 , 8 , 15 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If take coumadin , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) drawn check well blood clot . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , performance status record vital sign measure . Within 7 day Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Blood ( 2-3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If take coumadin , blood ( 1-2 teaspoon ) drawn check well blood clot . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You neurological exam . Every 6 week ( , odd-numbered cycle ) : - You may CT scan MRI scan chest , abdomen , pelvis check status disease . - You MRI brain . The MRI require catheter insert one vein order inject MRI contrast agent . The study doctor staff review image scan check stage disease tumor inside and/or outside brain . Length Study : You may continue receive TPI 287 long doctor think best interest . You longer able receive TPI 287 disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-treatment follow-up visit . End-of Treatment Visit : About 4 week stop take TPI 287 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You neurological exam . - Your performance status measure . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You CT and/or MRI check status disease . This may include brain MRI . If doctor think need , bone scan . - You ask side effect may drug may take . Follow-Up Visits : Once off-study , contact either clinic phone every 3 month 1 year enrol study check status health . If call , take less 5 minute . This investigational study . TPI 287 FDA approve commercially available . At time , TPI 287 use research . Up 69 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
