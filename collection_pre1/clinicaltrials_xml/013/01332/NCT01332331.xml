	<brief_summary>A 6-month ( 24-week ) , randomize , open label evaluation safety , tolerability , efficacy high low dose ambrisentan ( adjust body weight ) treatment group subject age 8 year 18 year pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) . An additional objective determine ambrisentan population pharmacokinetics paediatric population . The study include screening/baseline period treatment period . The treatment period 24 week subject 's clinical condition deteriorates point alternative/additional treatment necessary . Patients participate study continue treatment ambrisentan desire eligible enrol long term follow-up study . The primary comparison safety tolerability two ambrisentan dose group ( Low vs. High ) paediatric PAH population The secondary comparison change baseline efficacy parameter two treatment group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) rare , progressive , highly debilitate disease characterize vascular obstruction variable presence vasoconstriction , lead increase pulmonary vascular resistance right-sided heart failure . If leave untreated , PAH ultimately lead right ventricular failure death ; adult subject median survival 2.8 year without treatment . Epidemiological estimate vary prevalence Europe think order 15 case per million . Large scale epidemiology study PAH child conduct limited outcome data pediatric PAH patient . A register France ( 1995-1996 ) estimate prevalence child low 3.7 case per million . In national , comprehensive country wide survey epidemiology idiopathic PAH ( IPAH ) management survival United Kingdom ( UK ) incidence 0.48 case per million child per year prevalence 2.1 case per million child . Ambrisentan ( VOLIBRIS™ tablet ) endothelin receptor antagonist ( ERA ) market European Union ( EU ) country GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) United States LETAIRIS® Gilead Sciences Inc. Ambrisentan indicate treatment adult patient PAH improve exercise capacity , decrease symptom PAH , delay clinical worsening . The primary purpose paediatric study provide clinically relevant information safety pharmacokinetic profile ambrisentan child common cause PAH age group . The design study also intend provide information guide dose selection supportive efficacy data age group . Despite fact none currently available adult treatment license use child &lt; 12 yr , ( exception bosentan recently approve use paediatric population 2 year age ) widely use label . This study provide useful prescribe information medical community treat orphan disease child environment rapidly change medical practice . This study part Paediatric Investigational Plan ( PIP ; EMEA-000434-PIP01-08 ) agree European Medicines Agency 's Paediatric Committee ( PDCO ) .</detailed_description>
