	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial evaluate effect new dental tool handle design hand arm symptom among dentist dental hygienist perform dental scaling . This 4 month intervention practitioner 's workplace . The study may identify tool handle design reduces risk develop upper extremity occupational musculoskeletal disorder ( e.g. , carpal tunnel syndrome ) among dentist dental hygienist . The specific aim project determine whether hand/wrist , forearm/elbow shoulder symptom ( e.g. , pain , fatigue , paresthesia ) hand function less severe among dentist dental hygienist use new dental tool comparison use conventional tool perform scaling . One hundred twenty ( 120 ) subject randomize use one 2 handle design 4 month period time perform usual dental scaling work new tool . The effect outcome measure adjust potential covariates ( e.g. , age , gender , hour scale per week , etc. ) . The primary null hypothesis : difference change pain severity subject use new tool comparison use conventional tool . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In study , 120 participate dentist dental hygienist randomize receive one 2 scaling tool use tool 3 month perform usual dental scaling work . Randomization level clinic avoid participant contamination . Participants complete weekly questionnaire ass symptom severity . The data analysis use intention-to-treat approach control important covariates . Interventions Based pilot data , investigator select 2 tool handle design similar conventional tool feature exploit difference identify preliminary data . The dependent measure pinch force muscle activity sensitive diameter , follow weight , follow shape . The tool characteristic select proposal base data laboratory study present Preliminary Studies section Appendix ( Dong et al. , JADA , 2006 ; Dong et al. , Appl Ergo , 2007 ) . The tool parameter select provide great difference peak pinch force , yet close possible look feel conventional instrument . Half participant provide Tool 1 half Tool 2 . Tool 1 close conventional tool diameter weight Tool 2 large diameter lighter . The difference similarity Tools 1 2 list . Tool 1 Tool 2 Color black black Material steel Dacron Surface texture medium diamond medium diamond Diameter 7.5 mm 10.8 mm Weight 20 g 12 g Shape round round The investigator expect participant apply less force Tool 2 Tool 1 , therefore , decrease risk hand pain disorder . Subjects Dentists dental hygienist ( N=120 ) recruit community private clinic Bay Area . Recruitment Dentists recruit county dental society meeting mailing clinic ( mail list provide CDA The Zenith ) . Dental hygienist recruit mailing home place work ( mail list provide regional dental hygiene association ) informational meeting regional dental hygiene meeting dental clinic . At recruitment meeting , potential participant hand consent form study . The inclusion criterion explain one co-investigators question answer . Potential participant complete brief , anonymous survey indicate whether eligible whether interested participating . If interested eligible participating , sign consent form enrol study . Mailings include description study , consent form participation postcard . The postcard 3 check box : ( 1 ) yes I interested participate , please call , ( 2 ) I question study , please call , ( 3 ) I interested participate , please contact . Those agree participate instruct sign consent form return . Baseline Questionnaire Participants mail 30 minute baseline questionnaire collect follow demographic information covariates : recent current symptom MSD ; occupational history ; current job information ( e.g. , hour per clinic per week , hour scale per week , glove type use ) ; medical history include previous musculoskeletal injury illness , pain medication usage , systemic disease related MSDs ; tobacco use ; personal demographic ; psychosocial factor . The investigator plan use standardized Job Content Questionnaire measure job control , psychological demand , job strain , social support , job satisfaction ( Karasek et al. , 1998 ; Rempel et al . 2006 ) . End-of-Week Questionnaire : Pre-intervention They also begin complete weekly , 5 minute , end-of-week questionnaire ( see appendix ) assess work hour week , number hour scale week , medication use pain , hand function , acute injury event upper extremity ( e.g. , laceration , bruise ) week ( If elevate pain score due acute traumatic event , symptom score week exclude analysis ) . Three body region ( 1 ) right hand/wrist , ( 2 ) right elbow/forearm ( 3 ) right shoulder ( left subject performs scale left hand ) , assess bad pain precede 7 day use 0 10 point scale ( 0=no pain ; 10=unbearable pain ) ( Gerr et al . 2002 ) . Randomization intervention The dental office participant work randomize either Tool 1 Tool 2 . A computer generate random number sequence use . All participant dental office use tool avoid contamination . After complete end-of-week questionnaire four week participant receive new set 8 assigned dental tool instruct use , tip replacement , tip sharpen sterilization . If one participant office , tool participant separately label color tape identify owner . End-of-Week Questionnaire : Post-intervention The end-of-week questionnaire administer next 3 month . However , questionnaire contain additional question ask percent time use new tool scale . This question allow u determine assigned tool use . Data Analysis Sample Size Calculations The analysis follow intention-to-treat approach . For analysis effect intervention pain three body region , primary outcome measure pain score change ( difference mean post-intervention pain level , collect last 4 week participation study , minus mean pre-intervention pain level ) . Because analysis use intention treat approach , subject drop study early , investigator use pain data 4 week prior drop point estimate mean post-intervention pain score . Therefore , investigator collect weekly symptom data throughout intervention period . The subject study relatively stable occupational setting , investigator anticipate many subject leave early . Ultimately , change pain score intervention , weekly data use graphically explore time course change . Missing weekly pain score impute mean score prior follow miss data . General linear model use calculate beta-coefficient 95 percent confidence interval intervention two body region . The mean pre-intervention pain score forced model reduce regression mean . The possible covariates ( e.g. , gender , age , occupation , hour per week scaling , psychosocial factor , etc . ) examine , one time , multivariate model include pre-intervention pain score . They include final model modestly ( p &lt; 0.2 ) relate dependent variable ( e.g. , pain score change ) intervention group . The investigator expect effective randomization likely potential covariates include final model . The potential problem unequal gender distribution occupational group address also test effect new single variable 4 category ( male dentist , female dentist , male hygienist , female hygienist ) model . The analysis hand function data similar analysis pain . The sample size calculation base estimate mean hand pain score 2.9 ( SD 1.6 ; scale 0-10 ) ( base value collect subject preliminary study ) . For type I error 5 % , investigator would need total 82 subject ( 41 group ) 80 % power detect mean pain score change difference 1.0 ( 33 % difference pain score change ) . Covariates final model increase require sample size . To account covariates dropouts investigator recruit total 120 subject . The selection difference 1.0 pain score change base affect expect difference 27 40 % pinch force . Unfortunately , investigator good dose-response data link reduction risk factor level , pinch force , reduction pain level . If dose-response relationship linear , investigator might expect similar reduction pain intensity . In 3 prior RCT intervention study , although intervention different proposal , investigator observe effect level . The study among engineer , customer service , garment worker study duration 6 , 12 4 month . The observed effect upper extremity pain score 41 % ( 1.2/2.9 ) , 28 % ( 0.7/2.3 ) , 42 % ( 1.0/2.4 ) ( Tittranonda et al. , 1999 ; Rempel et al. , 2006 ; Rempel et al. , 2007 ) .</detailed_description>
