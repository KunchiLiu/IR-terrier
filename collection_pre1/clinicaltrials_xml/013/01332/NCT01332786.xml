	<brief_title>Safety Study Evaluating Intravenous Infusions Tigecycline Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Relapsed refractory hematologic malignancy poor response standard therapy associate poor prognosis . For example , relapse acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) highly aggressive resistant disease , particularly associate first complete response ( CR ) duration le 12 month . Thus , urgent need new agent relapse refractory hematologic malignancy acute leukemia . In elderly patient , tolerance aggressive induction therapy often poor curative option bone marrow transplantation HSCT available , need effective non-aggressive drug regimen AML even great . Tigecycline glycylcycline derivative tetracycline . Tigecycline currently indicate treatment complicate skin skin structure infection , complicate intra-abdominal infection . This clinical trial Phase I dose escalation study tigecycline patient relapse refractory AML newly diagnose disease eligible induction chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
