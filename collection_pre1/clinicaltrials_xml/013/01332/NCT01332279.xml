	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose give everolimus ( RAD001 ) erlotinib hydrochloride together radiation therapy treat patient recurrent head neck cancer previously treat radiation therapy . RAD001 erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving RAD001 erlotinib hydrochloride together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) safety RAD001 give concurrently external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) re-irradiation set head neck cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Obtain preliminary data response rate . II . Determine progression-free survival 6 12 month overall survival . III . Perform correlative study evaluate characterize biological feature recurrent second primary tumor , well follow surrogate mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha ( HIF-1Î± ) inhibition . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study everolimus erlotinib hydrochloride . Patients receive RAD001 orally ( PO ) erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily ( QD ) . Treatment continue 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also undergo EBRT twice daily ( BID ) 5 day week 5 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 year .</detailed_description>
