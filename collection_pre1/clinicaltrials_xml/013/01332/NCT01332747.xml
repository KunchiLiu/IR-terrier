	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluate Antihyperlipidemic Effect Classical Unani Antiobesity Formulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The large proportion cardiovascular disease represent Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , cerebral peripheral vascular disease . During past decade efficacious strategy develop prevention disease . These strategy involve general lifestyle change , include , healthy diet , optimal weight , physical activity , moderate alcohol consumption , smoke cessation , treatment high blood pressure , control diabetes mellitus particular , treatment hyperlipidemia . - Major clinical trial carry , show clear benefit low density lipoprotein-cholesterol ( LDL-C ) reduction term CAD event total mortality . A similar reduction relative risk coronary event document patient without clinically evident CAD patient mild severe hyperlipidemia . - Hyperlipidemia primary gene related causing defect synthesis lipoprotein degradation . The type hyperlipidemia secondary subsequent relate metabolic abnormality . - Although several Unani physician mention considerable detail fat blood observed Hyperlipidemia mention per se classical Unani literature . - A condition resemble hyperlipidemia various aspect like etiology , clinical feature complication describe obesity classical Unani literature mention relate method manage disorder include regimen drug ( reduce weight ) also observe reference . - Unani physician bracket obesity cold derangement temperament . - Unani physician emphasize effect Safoof-e-Muhazzil main weight loss drug . - Furthermore , Many drug present Safoof-e-Muhazzil include Lac constituent Safoof-e-Muhazzil attribute Unani physician de obstruent , desiccant , soften relaxant effect vessel wall property support hypothesis . These property also cohesion hypothesis perhaps drug may scrap effect atherosclerotic vessel wall . - Lipids metabolize mainly liver error liver weakness liver lipid go unchecked blood stream . - Since constituent Safoof-e-Muhazzil include Lac attribute liver strengthen agent , hence , due corrective effect liver may help correct raise lipid level blood .</detailed_description>
