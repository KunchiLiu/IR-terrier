	<brief_summary>Our study compare use continuous saphenous nerve block perform adductor canal addition Local Infiltration Analgesia ( LIA ) versus Sham block addition LIA total knee replacement . The investigator hypothesize saphenous nerve block perform level adductor canal addition LIA provide well pain relief LIA alone without significantly compromise muscle strength physiotherapy , enable patient mobilize early reduce opioid consumption le side effect . The investigator enroll total 40 patient ( 20 patient receive continuous saphenous nerve block addition LIA 20 receive sham block LIA ) . Until discharge , investigator record patient ' pain score , opioid consumption , side effect physical therapy progress . If study prove continuous saphenous nerve block addition LIA effectively reduce postoperative pain score acceptable level well physical therapy progress le opioid consumption , could see attractive alternative LIA alone traditionally use method postoperative pain control compromise muscle strength physiotherapy .</brief_summary>
