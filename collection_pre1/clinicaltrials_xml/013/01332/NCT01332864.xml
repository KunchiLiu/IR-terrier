	<brief_title>Effect Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment Patients With Chronic Headache</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sixty subject recruit participate study via word mouth mass email notification employee student Western University Health Sciences Pomona , CA . Patients randomly assign 1 4 group specific Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment ( OMT ) : Compression Fourth Ventricle ( CV4 ) , CV4 subject appropriate OMT , subject appropriate OMT ( CV4 ) , sham ( touch ) . There 8 subject per OMT group , make 24 subject altogether assign one three OMT group , 24 sham subject . Power analysis determination sample size : The investigator data preliminary study effect OMT chronic headache , one study immediate effect tension type headache patient CV4 , power analysis rough estimate point one week headache symptom evaluation post OMT . From preliminary study lab , investigator expect 'CV4 ' 80 % participant significant still point objective response v sham treatment investigator expect significantly effect 10 % participant . There need least 16 subject two group assess outcome measure , 16 receive CV4 16 sham detect 70 % difference still point measure . To detect difference OMT sham , since three group receive OMT type , investigator consider many three group vs sham group , investigator figure 8 per OMT group , 2 CV4 ( thus 16 get CV4 ) , make 24 subject combine OMT group . Therefore , investigator need 24 sham subject make equal number balance analysis ( OMT v sham ) , detect difference OMT intervention sham intervention . Considering possibility 25 % , 12 subject , respond follow survey one week , investigator figure recruitment 60 subject would ensure investigator would enough make calculation able determine significant difference group . The investigator preliminary study effect OMT sham mood patient headache , part study exploratory assessment sample size calculation able perform data gather study subsequent study .</detailed_description>
