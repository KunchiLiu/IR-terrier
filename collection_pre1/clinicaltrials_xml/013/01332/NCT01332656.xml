	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To demonstrate improvement Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) Ombrabulin versus placebo patient platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer ( OC ) treat paclitaxel carboplatin . Secondary Objectives : - To compare overall survival ( OS ) 2 treatment arm - To compare objective response rate ( RR ) 2 treatment arm</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Ombrabulin Patients With Platinum-Sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer Treated With Carboplatin/Paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment continue disease progression unacceptable toxicity consent withdrawal . A minimum 6 cycle combine therapy administer , unless progression occur safety reason cause discontinuation one two drug combination therapy . In case progression , investigator 's decision continue study treatment 6 cycle accord clinical practice .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . Signed informed consent . 2 . At least 18 year age . 3 . Histological and/or cytological diagnosis epithelial ovarian carcinoma , fallopian tube cancer , primary peritoneal carcinoma . 4 . Completion maximum one previous line chemotherapy contain platinum agent . Neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment include surgical procedure consider one line platinumbased . 5 . Documented sensitivity platinum base chemotherapy regimen . `` Platinumsensitivity '' define relapse 6 month last dose platinumbased chemotherapy . 6 . Measurable progressive disease : Measurable disease ( defined RECIST 1.1 ) define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must least 10mm measure compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Lymph node must &gt; 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI . In case single measurable lesion , previously irradiate . 7 . ECOG performance status ≤2 8 . Life expectancy 12 week Exclusion criterion : 1 . History uncontrolled brain metastasis , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis . 2 . History another neoplasm . Adequately treat basal cell squamous skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient diseasefree &gt; 5 year allow . 3 . Participation another clinical trial concurrent treatment investigational drug antitumor therapy radiotherapy within 21 day prior randomization ( 28 day therapy schedule administration every 4 week except nitrosoureas , mitomycin may use 6 week prior first cycle provide patient residual sign toxicity ) . No washout require hormonotherapy discontinue first cycle . 4 . Any severe acute chronic medical condition , could impair ability patient participate study interfere interpretation study result . 5 . Pregnancy breastfeed . Positive serum urine pregnancy test prior randomization . 6 . Patient reproductive potential agree use accept effective method contraception study treatment period least 6 month completion study treatment . The definition `` effective method contraception '' base investigator 's judgment . Effective method contraception also adapt local regulation . 7 . Inadequate organ function include : neutrophil &lt; 1.5 x 10^9/L ; platelet &lt; 100 x 10^9/L ; creatinine ≥ 1.5 ULN . If creatinine ≥ ULN , calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 60 ml/min ( per Cockcroft Formula ) . Total bilirubin within normal limit ALT/AST/AP &gt; 2.5 time upper normal limit institutional norm . An increase AP grade 2 would accept increase relate presence bone metastasis . Bone specific isoenzyme AP evaluate . 8 . Urine proteincreatinin ratio ( UPCR ) &gt; 1 ( urinanalysis morning spot urine ) proteinuria &gt; 500 mg/24h 9 . Preexisting peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 accord NCI CTCAE V.4.03 10 . Preexisting hear impairment &gt; grade 1 11 . Known hypersensitivity due taxanes /or polysorbate 80 compound/excipients study drug combination 12 . Discontinuation previous treatment paclitaxel and/or carboplatin toxicity reason 13 . Other serious illness medical condition ( restrict ) : Active infection Superior vena cava syndrome Pericardial effusion require intervention ( drainage ) 14 . Documented medical history myocardial infarction , document angina pectoris , arrhythmia especially severe conduction disorder second thirddegree atrioventricular block , stroke , history arterial venous thromboembolism within past 6 month still require anticoagulant . 15 . Cardiac Troponin level exceed normal range value define laboratory 16 . Uncontrolled hypertension within 3 month prior study treatment patient organ damage relate hypertension . 17 . Patient LVEF value low institution inferior normal limit , evaluate echocardiography angiocardiography 18 . 12lead ECG : Infarction Qwave , ST segment depression elevation ≥1 mm least 2 contiguous lead QT/QTcTime &gt; 450ms The information intend contain consideration relevant patient 's potential participation clinical trial .</criteria>
