	<brief_summary>Previous research lab others establish type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) associate significantly impaired functional exercise capacity , factor potentially associate increase risk cardiovascular disease type 2 diabetes . Of great concern , majority people type 2 diabetes sedentary one possible reason may exercise , even low level , perceive hard effort nondiabetic people . Thus , treatment may motivate patient type 2 diabetes physically active great potential benefit . Recent observational study suggest glucagon-like peptide-1 agent , exenatide , may beneficial effect endothelial cardiac function . Because two factor show associated exercise dysfunction type 2 diabetes , investigator hypothesize exenatide may improve exercise capacity type 2 diabetes . The aim study ( 1 ) ass whether exenatide improve functional exercise capacity person type 2 diabetes ( 2 ) investigate effect exenatide specific metabolic , endothelial , cardiac peripheral circulatory measure function relate change exercise capacity . The Investigators primary hypothesis exenatide improve functional exercise capacity people type 2 diabetes . Having drug improves exercise capacity could motivate patient exercise hence significant benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects come total seven test visit , include two screen visit , evaluation take place . Visits structure follow : Visits 1 , 2 3 complete four-week period . 1 . After subject review study give consent study participation , history physical exam perform . In addition , Low-level Physical Activity Recall ( LoPAR ) questionnaire , pulmonary function testing , vital sign perform . 2 . Subjects ask fast prior visit 2 . Blood urine sample collect measurement glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1C ) , fast glucose , fast insulin , free fatty acid microalbuminuria ( measure covariates analysis ) . A dietary survey administer food preference three day study diet administer prior visit 3 , 4 , 6 7 . Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) body composition test do ensure group weight similar ( use fat-free mass ) . Autonomic nervous system test , rest electrocardiogram ( EKG ) familiarization bicycle test perform . 3 . Subjects receive three day study diet prior visit 3 . A resting exercise EKG perform day visit . Patients measure make cardiac function endothelial function visit 3 well use plethysmography cardiac echo . The peak aerobic capacity ( VO2max ) test perform . Vital sign take rest . 4 . Randomization : Subjects receive three day study diet prior visit 4 . During visit four , arterial stiffness/endothelial function non-invasively measure Sphygmocor system . Subjects three constant-load test measure oxygen ( VO2 ) kinetics oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) measure exercise . A resting exercise EKG vital sign perform visit . Subjects randomize either take exenatide placebo must take metformin ( 1-2 gram /d ) least 3 month . Exenatide titrate start 5 mcg twice per day two week move 10 mcg twice per day tolerate placebo dose match titration . During treatment phase subject give log keep track blood glucose day . Study coordinator contact subject weekly obtain value check study doctor share subject 's primary care physician adjustment medication need make . 5 . Week 4 : Visit 5 consist physical exam clinician well blood draw check vital sign exenatide treatment . 6 . Week 12 : After 3 month exenatide placebo administration , procedure Visit 3 repeat Visit 6 . Additional testing perform visit 6 include physical exam perform study physician , DXA scan body composition test monitor change body composition ( fat-free mass ) , blood work lab test list Visit 2 LoPAR questionnaire . 7 . Week 13 : During visit 7 , test perform visit 4 repeat 3 month exenatide placebo administration . Subjects continue exenatide placebo treatment complete exit test Weeks 12 13 .</detailed_description>
