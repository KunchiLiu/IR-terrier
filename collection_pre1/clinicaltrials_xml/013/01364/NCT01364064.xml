	<criteria>1 . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 . 2 . Age ≥ 18 year . 4 . CBC/differential obtain within 14 day prior study registration , adequate bone marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 . Platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/mm3 . Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl . ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥ 10 g/dl acceptable . ) Adequate renal function , define : BUN ≤ 25 mg/dl within 14 day prior study registration Creatinine ≤ 1.7 mg/dl within 14 day prior study registration 4 . Adequate hepatic function , define : Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl within 14 day prior study registration ALT ≤ 3 x normal range within 14 day prior study registration AST ≤ 3 x normal range within 14 day prior study registration 5 . Patients must sign studyspecific inform consent prior study registration . If patient 's mental status preclude his/her give inform consent , write informed consent may give responsible family member . 6 . For female childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior start temozolomide . 7 . Women childbearing potential male participant must practice adequate contraception . 1 . Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free ≥ 3 year . ( For example , carcinoma situ breast , oral cavity , cervix permissible ) . 2 . Recurrent multifocal malignant glioma 3 . Metastases detect tentorium beyond cranial vault . 4 . Prior chemotherapy radiosensitizers cancer head neck region ; note prior chemotherapy different cancer allowable . Prior use Gliadel wafer intratumoral intracavitary treatment permit . 5 . Prior radiotherapy head neck ( except T1 glottic cancer ) , result overlap radiation field . 6 . Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ; note , however , laboratory test liver function coagulation parameter require entry protocol . Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ; note , however , HIV test require entry protocol . The need exclude patient AIDS protocol necessary treatment involve protocol may significantly immunosuppressive . Major medical illness psychiatric impairment investigator 's opinion prevent administration completion protocol therapy . Active connective tissue disorder , lupus scleroderma , opinion treat physician may put patient high risk radiation toxicity .</criteria>
