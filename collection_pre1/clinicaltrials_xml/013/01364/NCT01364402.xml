	<brief_summary>This ia prospective , randomize , double blind , placebo control trial . patient schedule primary PCI elective PCI randomly allocate receive either single dose EPO ( Recormon , Roche , Epoetin beta ) saline intravenously PCI . The investigator assume incidence rate CIN significantly low EPO group compare placebo . In addition , EPO administration result decrease infarct size .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiological procedure utilize intravascular contrast medium widely apply diagnostic therapeutic purpose . This result increase incidence procedure-related contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) , find associated poor outcome include high in-hospital mortality rate . Therefore , find way prevent CIN valuable clinical research goal . However , current method efficient cost-effective prevention CIN . Erythropoietin ( EPO ) show elicit tissue-protective effect various experimental model clinical study acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . Therefore , prospective , randomize , double blind , placebo control trial aim evaluate , first time , effectiveness EPO prevention CIN percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . The potential reno-protective effect EPO expect reduce incidence third leading cause hospital-acquired acute kidney injury . The together cardio-protective effect EPO expect reduce patient 's morbidity , mortality high health cost associate CIN treatment .</detailed_description>
