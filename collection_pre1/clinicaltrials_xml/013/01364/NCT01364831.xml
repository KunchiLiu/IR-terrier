	<brief_summary>In last decade much knowledge accumulate connection healthy , sufficient sleep overall health , cognitive function , memory job school performance , motor vehicle accident work accident . There grow awareness recently connection physical activity competitive sport performance , amount quality sleep . Despite dearth scientific study , constant effort improve understanding field . An appropriate procedure design evaluate influence quality amount sleep ability athletic performance must fulfill number basic requirement : 1 . Isolating influence component related sleep homeostasis factor relate circadian rhythm . 2 . Neutralizing much possible influence motivation evaluation - one must presumably include significant competitive event ( always possible simple extrapolation physiological measurement competitive performance ) . 3 . Isolating cancel much possible additional factor affect performance , : home advantage , weather , injury field condition . Athletic activity include competition also train towards competition , since difficult control influence competition occasional event , study investigator focus evaluation connection sleep athletic performance training . Towards end adolescence , youth busy multiple activity relate study , social obligation athletic activity . This also age learn drive . This age physiologically person need sleep relative age ( 9.25 hour sleep day ) , paradoxically due multiple obligation amount sleep low need . Beyond effect mood , cognitive performance memory , sleep deprivation cause far-reaching change multiple system , : Cardiovascular System : - Many study show shortened sleep duration constitutes independent cause increase cardiac event . - Resting heart rate maximum heart rate decrease 30 hour sleep deprivation . Respiratory System : - Significant decline respiratory function measure : FVC , Maximal voluntary ventilation , Maximal static inspiratory/expiratory pressure , Time exhaustion exercise , Peak O2 consumption , Peak CO2 production . - Worsening respiratory sleep disturbance . Digestive System : • Changes food consumption accompany change body weight . Neurophysiological System • Disturbance thermoregulation . Endocrine System : - Hormonal change associate hypothalamic-hypophyseal axis - Influence secretion Ghrelin leptin - Influence secretion growth hormone . In light , sound basis presumption athletic performance connect influence directly indirectly . The purpose study evaluate connection sleep quality duration athletic performance among young athlete live train Sport-Gifted Centre Wingate Institute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim The purpose study evaluate connection sleep quality duration athletic performance among young athlete live train Sport-Gifted Centre Wingate Institute . Methods 50 athlete Sport-Gifted Centre Wingate Institute , age 13-20 , male female , branch triathlon swim . Participants parent ask give informed consent . The propose study two stage : 1 . Baseline assessment : In first stage evaluation sleep quality duration athlete course two week , parallel athletic performance evaluate use accepted measure : swimming time set distance , run time set distance , etc . 2 . Assessment intervention 's effect prolong duration nighttime sleep athletic performance participant , use measure . This stage take four week . Stage 1 : Before begin study participant fill general health questionnaire . Each participant receive Suunto heart monitor belt sleep two week . Each participant ask wear belt go bed take upon wake morning . Heart rate data store belt transfer morning computer . Analysis sleep architecture duration course two week carry use HC1000P system HypoCore Inc. ( see attach document ) . In addition average heart rate maximal heart rate assess training baseline record heart rate use Suunto belt . Sleep data analyze participant receive personalize analysis his/her sleep . At stage investigator evaluate baseline characteristic participant include sleep duration , sleep efficiency , presence duration different sleep stage , particular slow wave sleep know growth factor release important muscle recovery , time duration train session athletic performance . Evaluation athletic performance do use standard test routinely carry part athlete ' training program every branch sport . For triathletes run time 3000 meter measure , swimmer time set distance ( 50 meters,100 meter , 400 meter , etc ) . All measure do without deviation regular training routine . Also general parameter measure like stand heart rate recline heart rate , heart rate awaken morning . Stage 2 : At stage participant divide randomly two group . In course additional training cycle two week one group label ' A ' give additional sleep time one two hour . The second group ( group ' B ' ) shall continue change . In course two week sleep parameter group assess analyze , athletic performance routine training continue measure tabulate . After two week two group cross , group ' A ' return routine sleep schedule , i.e . extra sleep time remove group ' B ' get additional sleep time . All aforementioned measure collect two week ( sleep quality , athletic performance training ) . After analysis result test recommend need well change train program , daily schedule sleep schedule . During entire study close monitoring injury among participant . Events defined injury ( accord number treatment physiotherapist visit doctor ) near injury quantify , correlation seek performance , injury sleep duration . In stage addition wear heart rate belt , participant ask fill questionnaire sleep entire study ( see attach document ) . Note : Suunto Finnish company make advanced sport watch sensitive heart rate belt use athlete train . The belt soft , high quality , lightweight contains sensor memory unit store heart rate data participant . It approve routine use monitor heart rate people engage physical activity . Expected benefit : - Better understanding physiology associate sleep among adolescent involve regular , competitive physical activity . - Improved performance building sleep program , optimal wakefulness training .</detailed_description>
