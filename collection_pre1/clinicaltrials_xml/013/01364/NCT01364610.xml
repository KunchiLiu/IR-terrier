	<brief_summary>Gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) common potentially debilitate disorder . Typical symptom include heartburn regurgitation acid taste substance . GERD chronic disease case , alarm symptom include food stick esophagus , pain swallowing , bleeding , anemia weight loss develop . In Alberta , upper endoscopy first line investigation accompany ambulatory 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring patient symptoms unresponsive acid-suppressing therapy exhibit alarm symptom . Current standard care Alberta esophageal pH monitoring first require esophageal manometry test identify location lower esophageal sphincter follow placement thin catheter one pH probe insert nose taped place face 20 -24 hour . The patient wear small battery power data logger maintains diary GERD symptom activity . This system enable record correlation specific symptom reflux episode extend period provide direct evidence GERD . The nasally pass pH catheter uncomfortable restrictive patient often result abnormal eating , drinking , activity sleeping pattern . The data collect may representative patient 's typical experience may reflect true severity disease . A wireless diagnostic pH monitoring system call Bravo pH Monitoring System develop Medtronic approve use Canada commercially available . This system eliminate need catheter utilizing capsule size gel-cap radio frequency technology monitor esophageal pH . It show safe sensitive conventional catheter-based pH probe monitoring . The Bravo system sit either endoscopically manometrically . The goal study test Bravo Wireless pH system Alberta use manometric sit assess feasibility , patient outcome tolerance . Hypotheses : 1 . Patient tolerance Bravo system superior standard pH-metry . 2 . Manometric placement Bravo successful standard pH-metry . Our aim : 1 . To assess patient tolerance Bravo versus standard pH-metry . 2 . To compare success rate manometric peroral placement Bravo pH probe versus standard pH-metry .</brief_summary>
