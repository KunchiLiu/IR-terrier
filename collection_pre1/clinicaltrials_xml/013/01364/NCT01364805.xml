	<brief_summary>In United States , approximately 30,000 new case pancreatic cancer diagnose year almost equal number death related cancer . Different type chemotherapeutic treatment use target different part cancer cell success , room treatment option . It known people cancer use high dos intravenous vitamin C also know ascorbate , cancer treatment occur frequently . When Vitamin C give manner , take mouth ; instead , enters body IV ( intravenous ) site , tube insert needle vein . If port-a-cath place , IV give use port .
