About 850 patient incident stroke follow 3 year assessment baseline 3 , 12 , 24 , 36 month . Factors already report significant predictor vascular disease previous study well new biomarkers ( e.g . neuroimaging , blood base biomarkers ) identify cohort consider . The improvement discrimination include new variable model investigate . Several measure improve predictive property ( e.g . calibration , discrimination , net reclassification ) use compare predictive model different complexity . The model validate use bootstrap method ( internal validation ) independent external sample cooperation prospective CSB-stroke cohort .</detailed_description>
