	<brief_summary>Parkinson 's disease progressive condition harm nerve cell brain ( neurodegeneration ) . Current treatment Parkinson 's disease ( include levodopa deep brain stimulation ) improve certain symptom think improve underlie neurodegenerative disease process ( `` cure '' ) . The cause Parkinson 's disease unknown . However , evidence suggest tiny structure investigator cell call `` mitochondrion '' might involve . Mitochondria powerhouses produce fuel investigator cell . Failure 'powerhouses ' supply energy need certain nerve cell might lead Parkinson 's disease . Preliminary evidence suggest food call 'ketones ' might able enhance function mitochondrion improve Parkinson 's disease symptoms possibly even neurodegenerative process . In study , investigator would like investigate possibility give patient Parkinson 's disease dietary supplement 'ketone ester ' drink . The investigator assess improves symptom Parkinson 's disease . The study design prospective , double blind , randomise , control trial .</brief_summary>
