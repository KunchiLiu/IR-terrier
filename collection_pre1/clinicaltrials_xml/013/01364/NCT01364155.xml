	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability LIM-0705 administer 28 day adult male female impair glucose tolerance abnormal HOMA-IR . Secondary Objectives include : - examine pharmacokinetics ( PK ) LIM-0705 - explore pharmacodynamics ( PD ) LIM-0705 obese adult male female impair glucose tolerance ( define two-hour plasma glucose level ≥140 ≤199 mg per dL [ 7.8 11.06 mmol/L ] 75-g oral glucose tolerance test [ OGTT ] ) abnormal HOMA-IR ( HOMA-IR value ≥ 2.5 ) measure change response hyperinsulinemic clamp , mixed-meal tolerance test ( MMTT ) Days -2 27 - explore effect LIM-0705 fasting lipid , insulin glucose profile compare baseline level</detailed_description>
