	<brief_summary>It anticipate 548 subject recruit approximately 27 centre South Korea . This investigator-sponsored , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , multi-centre study ass effect rosuvastatin 20 mg compare placebo acute ischemic stroke patient , first dose within 18 hour baseline MRI continue treatment 14 day . Subjects male female , 20 year , diagnosis acute ischemic stroke baseline MRI , either statin-naïve untreated statin previous 3 month . The objective would compare recurrence rate ischemic stroke compare image parameter 14 day treatment clinical improvement define percent improvement base NIHSS score measurement baseline , 5 day 14 day treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Very Early Use Rosuvastatin Preventing Recurrence Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Statins action mechanism may work nicely prevent recurrence acute stage infarction ! First , statins antithrombotic effect low thrombogenicity . Statins prolong time arterial thrombosis endothelial injury model , inhibit P-selectin expression platelet aggregation , reduce platelet PAR-1 thrombin receptor , reduce tissue factor level plasma , expression monocyte surface , atherosclerotic plaque . Second , statins enhance thrombolysis . They reduce PAI-1 , increase t-PA activity reduce fibrinogen level . Combined treatment statins t-PA rat reduce infarct size downregulates expression tissue factor , ICAM-1 , vWF , MMP-9 . In addition , t-PA induced toxicity reverse statin . Third , statins anti-inflammatory action stabilize even regress plaque . Statins reduce number T-lymphocytes within plaque , inhibit migration activation monocyte/macrophage system , reduce matrix metalloproteinase activity play critical role plaque rupture . Rosuvastatin 40 mg could regress coronary atheroma burden 2 year , reduce progression carotid intima-media thickness . Benefits statin stroke patient partially proven ! First , statins well know effective primary prevention stroke . Second , statins effective secondary prevention stroke . A high dose statin ( atorvastatin 80 mg ) reduce recurrent stroke patient recent TIA ischemic stroke administrate 1-6 month stroke onset . However , uncertain whether statin effective first month stroke . Third , outcomes well patient statin treatment moment stroke . Patients pretreated statin show well survival , less severe neurologic deficit , improve outcome treated thrombolysis . However , unknown whether statin treatment stroke patient effective administrated acute stage . Based strong supportive evidence human experimental animal support theoretical superiority rosuvastatin , study test hypothesis high dose rosuvastatin effective prevent recurrence first month onset ischemic stroke patient give patient onset .</detailed_description>
