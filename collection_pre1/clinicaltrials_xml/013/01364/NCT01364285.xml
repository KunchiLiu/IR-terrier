	<brief_summary>The investigator know little patient feel follow radiosurgery treatment trigeminal neuralgia . Patient satisfaction may ultimately one important outcome measure individual patient ; however , adequately assess follow . Multiple question remain unanswered , include whether correlation patient satisfaction , level current pain score , presence degree facial numbness , possible side effect radiosurgery . Therefore , goal study gather information patient receive radiosurgery trigeminal neuralgia Stanford evaluate post-treatment patient satisfaction , degree facial numbness , current pain score . This data help investigator understand outcome important patient satisfaction follow treatment chronic pain syndrome .</brief_summary>
