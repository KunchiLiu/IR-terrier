	<brief_summary>Objective : To assess relationship maternal cardiovascular capacity aerobic water exercise gestational period hemodynamic overload . Study design : randomized clinical trial , 41 healthy pregnant woman assign one two group : Control Water exercise . Maternal cardiovascular capacity ( maximum oxygen consumption , cardiac output , stroke volume , heart rate mean arterial pressure ) , physical performance ( relative HR , treadmill speed self-perceived exertion ) neonatal outcome ( gestational age , weight , Apgar index length infant 's hospitalization ) assess . Means evaluated dependent independent t-tests , proportion chi-square method ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Results : The control variables show group homogeneous . Water exercise associate maintenance VO2max , increase stroke volume cardiac output , good performance stress test third trim gestation . No significant difference neonatal variable observe . Conclusion : Water exercise maintain cardiovascular capacity performance submaximal stress , affect hemodynamic adaptation gestation neonatal outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Significant hemodynamic change take place short period pregnancy , often place major burden maternal cardiovascular system . Normal pregnancy characterize increase cardiac output ( CO ) , stroke volume ( SV ) , heart rate ( HR ) blood volume , decrease arterial pressure vascular resistance . Classic study demonstrate increase 50 % maternal CO second third trimester . These circulatory adaptation responsible supply nutrient oxygen placenta fetus . The physiological change follow regular exercise improve training efficiency performance , define concept adaptation exercise aerobic training . Exercise cause heart lung efficient increase cardiovascular capacity resistance . CO , SV maximum oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) increase HR AP decrease . The importance effect overall health recognize outstanding medical scientific group . Therefore , regular exercise widely promote large number woman decide begin continue exercise pregnancy . This change woman 's behavior become matter concern among obstetrician important practical implication - maternal body apt bear hemodynamic burden pregnancy association exercise stress ? Studies effect exercise pregnancy scarce show conflict result , probably due difference exercise frequency , intensity , type , duration , gestational age training initiation . Aiming standardize exercise practice thus promote materno-fetal health , American College Obstetricians Gynecologists ( ACOG ) issue , 1985 , guideline exercise pregnancy . In subsequent review , new recommendation add , water exercise pregnancy recommend . Water exercise offer particular benefit include maintenance body temperature , control gestational edema , increase diuresis . Moreover , easily perform end pregnancy , favor compliance . These advantage add fact adverse effect fetus explain preference kind exercise pregnancy . Considering lack scientific evidence effect exercise pregnancy , result obtain previous work , purpose study ass relationship aerobic water exercise gestational period great hemodynamic burden maternal cardiovascular capacity neonatal outcome . METHODS This study part project approve Committee Research Ethics Botucatu Medical School-UNESP May 10 , 1999 . Study design : randomized clinical , without intention treat . Study subject : All eligible woman volunteer participate sequentially enrol randomize one two group accord computer-generated randomization list number create Epi-Info software . Each sequential number correspond sealed opaque envelope contain information randomization group order ensure concealment . Group 1 consist 29 woman engage Water Exercise , group 2 include 31 pregnant woman participate program ( control ) . Variables : independent variable study practice water exercise . The control variables , assessed baseline , include age , parity , pre-gestational body mass index ( BMI ) , HR MAP , smoking , sedentarism , gestational age baseline stress test . The dependent variable regard cardiovascular capacity physical performance submaximal stress test VO2max ; SV ; CO ; HR MAP , relative HR treadmill speed score obtain scale Borg . Neonatal variable include gestational age , weight ; Apgar index minute 1 minute 5 , length ( day ) infant 's hospitalization . Assessment cardiovascular capacity : perform prenatal visit 16-20 , 28-33 34-39 week . Cardiovascular capacity evaluate use treadmill submaximal stress test , accord protocol Balke-Ware &amp; Bruce require five minute treadmill fix incline constant individualize speed AP HR monitoring . Assessment physical performance stress test - purpose , relative HR , treadmill speed Borg scale score , obtain testing , use . A specific questionnaire administer subject order quantify stress perception test . Data processing analyse - give aim study ass efficacy ( exploratory intention-to-treat ) water exercise pregnancy , analysis include subject underwent cardiovascular assessment three study moment miss 2 exercise sessions/month . These data store specific database Statistical analysis perform SPSS software version 10.0.7 . Means compare use ANOVA follow t-tests independent ( group ) dependent ( within group ) sample . Data adequately transform necessary . Proportions compare chi-square test ( X2 ) . Statistical significance set 5 % ( p &lt; 0.005 ) .</detailed_description>
