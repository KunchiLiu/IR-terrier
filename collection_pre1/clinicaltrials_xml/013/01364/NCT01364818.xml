	<detailed_description>This study employ non-invasive custom-built four-point vertical displacement stimulator . This use deliver sinusoidal vibration low amplitude ( 0-400 micron ) tip finger . The forearm subject rest stimulator , finger tip vibrate , subject answer question prompt computer monitor perception stimulus . Research staff may explain question prompt way may better understood subject subject experience difficulty . This device use obtain objective psychophysical measurement subject undergo treatment . The investigator hope study eventually assist long term goal study way develop diagnostic method , base change cortical information processing capability occur neurodevelopmental disorder . This would enable clinician objectively determine prognosis best course intervention patient . This study consent 60 subject initiate change pharmacologic treatment either participant clinical trial private patient one study doctor . Subjects participant another clinical trial may one active medication non-active medication ( placebo ) . Subjects 7 visit study ( w0 prior initiate new treatment , 4,8 , 26 52,78 104 week start new treatment . The latter visit may occur either individual taking medication individual stop treatment ( order ass persistence treatment-related change ) .</detailed_description>
