	<brief_summary>A research study drug amrubicin patient cancer thymus ( thymoma thymic carcinoma ) . We hope learn whether drug effective safe treatment thymic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Amrubicin Relapsed Refractory Thymic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amrubicin , synthetic 9-aminoanthracycline , structurally similar doxorubicin , different primary mode action . It act primarily inhibitor DNA topoisomerase II , exert cytotoxic effect stabilize topoisomerase II mediate cleavable complex . This inhibition significantly see doxorubicin , , contrast , tend demonstrate DNA intercalation amrubicin . It yet evaluate use thymic malignancy , give efficacy NSCLC small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , well know efficacy anthracyclines topoisomerase II inhibitor first-line thymoma treatment , warrant study use second line beyond refractory relapsed patient . Unlike doxorubicin , amrubicin minimal cardiotoxicity even ongoing use , also make promise agent use second line even patient previously expose , potentially help , doxorubicin .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm invasive metastatic thymoma thymic carcinoma . Locally invasive disease acceptable , provide resectable . Previous treatment least one prior chemotherapy regimen . Documented progressive disease recent chemotherapy regimen . Presence measurable disease image within 4 week prior first dose Completion prior systemic therapy least 4 week prior first dose . Any prior immunotherapy therapy complete least 8 week prior first dose . Any prior surgery complete least 4 week prior first dose , adequate recover surgery . Any prior radiation therapy must residual toxic effect therapy . Chest radiotherapy curative intent primary disease complex must complete ≥ 28 day prior first dose . Cranial radiation must complete ≥ 21 day prior first dose . Radiotherapy area must complete ≥ 7 day prior first dose . Age ≥ 18 year . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Leukocytes ≥ 3000/mm³ Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm³ Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/d Serum bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ratio &lt; 3 x ULN Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 time institutional upper limit normal serum creatinine institutional upper limit normal , calculated serum creatinine clearance Cockcroft Gault method &gt; 60 mL/min Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 50 % transthoracic echocardiogram ( TTE ) multiple gated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) For female childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test within 4 week first dose . For male female childbearing potential , use effective contraceptive method study . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Current use , use within 4 week prior first dose , investigational agent . Known history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition amrubicin . Active malignancy require treatment thymic malignancy . Pregnant nursing female due unknown toxic effect amrubicin develop fetus breast milk . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Symptomatic central nervous system metastatic disease . Patients asymptomatic brain metastasis allow . If treated surgical resection radiation therapy , patient must stable &gt; = 2 week completion therapy . If patient corticosteroid , dose corticosteroid , dose corticosteroid must stable &gt; = 2 week prior first dose study treatment , process taper . Concurrent severe uncontrolled medical disease ( include limit active systemic infection , diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease , congestive hear failure mental illness ) opinion investigator would compromise safety patient compromise ability patient complete study . Known history seropositive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) use immunosuppressive medication condition would , opinion investigator , increase risk serious neutropenic complication .</criteria>
