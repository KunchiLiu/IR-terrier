	<brief_summary>This observational cohort study two time point ( baseline least 6 month treatment non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) ) . Approximately 40 participant , male female , 18 year age older recruit Pittsburgh IBD Cohort . Participants histological diagnosis IBD ( Ulcerative Colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) ) attend colonoscopy prior start non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent part standard medical care . Immediately follow colonoscopy , anal exam perform research purpose include : 1 . Perianal inspection 2 . Anal canal HPV swab 3 . Anal cytology 4 . Digital anal examination 5 . High resolution anoscopy ( HRA ) biopsy lesion visual criterion consistent high-grade anal dysplasia 6 . For female participant self- clinician-taken vaginal swab HPV typing . These procedure repeat routine colonoscopy follow least 6 month within 12 month non-corticosteroid immunosuppressive treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment IBD rely disease modification induction relative immunosuppression corticosteroid latterly increasingly , use immunomodulators ( azathioprine , mercaptopurine , methotrexate ) , biological agent anti tumor necrosis factor monoclonal antibody ( infliximab , adalimumab , certolizumab ) circulate receptor fusion protein ( etanercept ) . These agent impair cell mediate immunity ( CMI ) associate increase rate tuberculosis fungal infection treat population beyond see corticosteroid alone . Following initial infection , HPV control CMI manifestation infection become increasingly clinically apparent CMI impair due example HIV co-infection systemic immunosuppression . There appropriate concern IBD treatment community use immunosuppression modify disease course may lead increase rate HPV associate disease include wart , dysplasia ultimately anogenital cancer beyond establish increased risk associate IBD . In context important establish prevalence HPV infection anal dysplasia patient IBD treatment non-steroid immunosuppressive agent . These data help determine need HPV vaccination and/or anal dysplasia screen patient IBD . VISIT 1 ( Screening/Enrollment Visit ) : This visit include : - Medical/medication history . - Physical exam per standard care - Females reproductive potential give urine sample pregnancy test . This test must negative . - An anal Pap test abnormal cell . The researcher insert swab ( similar Q-tip ) anus . The end swab rub skin inside anus . - An anal swab test HPV ( use method anal Pap ) - Female participant also vaginal swab HPV . This may self take , take clinician . - An exam anus genital area lesion mass . - A rectal exam finger feel abnormality . - An anal exam call high resolution anoscopy ( HRA ) use special microscope dye examine anus abnormal area . A lubricated plastic speculum insert anus . Then , swab moisten acetic acid place anus abnormal area visible . A colposcope use view skin inside anus . A biopsy , without iodine visualization abnormal area , may take lesion appearance high-grade anal dysplasia abnormal finding . Within 1 day visit , study staff telephone participant ask side effect health problem study procedure . If necessary , participant may ask come clinic visit . VISIT 2 ( Final Visit ) : This visit occur 6 12 month first visit . Prior visit , participant instruct anal sex insert anything anus , include enema , 24 hour study visit . This visit include : - Medical/medication history - Physical exam per standard care - Females reproductive potential give urine 5ml blood sample ] pregnancy test . This test must negative . - Anal Pap test abnormal cell - Anal swab HPV - Females participant also vaginal swab HPV - An exam anus genital area lesion , tenderness mass - A rectal exam feel abnormality - High-resolution anoscopy ( HRA ) . A biopsy , without iodine visualization abnormal area , may take lesion appearance high-grade anal dysplasia abnormal finding . Within 1 day visit , study staff telephone participant ask side effect health problem study procedure . If necessary , participant may ask come clinic visit .</detailed_description>
