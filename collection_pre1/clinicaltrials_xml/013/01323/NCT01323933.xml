	<brief_title>First-in-human Study AB0024 Evaluate Safety Tolerability Adults With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This first-in-human , open-label , sequential dose escalation study evaluate AB0024 patient advance solid tumor . The study consist two part : Part A dose escalation , Part B dose expansion.The primary objective study characterize safety , tolerability , PK AB0024 multiple IV administration patient advance solid tumor . The secondary objective measure tumor response modify RECIST evaluate formation anti-AB0024 antibody . Patients receive infusion AB0024 every two week . Patients see weekly safety assessment collection blood sample . Patients show evidence disease progression clinical assessment CT MRI may continue receive AB0024 every 2 week disease progression ( clinical radiographic ) , study drug intolerance , withdrawal consent .</detailed_description>
