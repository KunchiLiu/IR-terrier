	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis B major health problem , affect 350 million people worldwide . ( 1 ) First line treatment consist pegylated IFN weekly oral nucleos ( ) ide analogue ( NA ) daily . ( 2 ) NA target reverse transcriptase hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) , potent inhibitor viral replication . In absence antiviral drug resistance , continue NA therapy able suppress viral replication prolong period , prevent clinical progression liver cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . ( 3 ) Currently approve agent include nucleoside analogue lamivudine ( LAM ) , telbivudine ( LdT ) , entecavir ( ETV ) , nucleotide analogues adefovir dipivoxil ( ADV ) , tenofovir disiproxil fumarate ( TDF ) . Entecavir ETV cyclopentyl guanosine analogue , potent selective inhibitor HBV replication vitro . ( 4 ) In phase III registration trial result superior virologic , biochemical histological efficacy one year therapy compare LAM HBeAg-positive HBeAg-negative chronic HBV patient . ( 5 , 6 ) Moreover , ETV prove high genetic barrier resistance 1.2 % NA-naïve HBV patient demonstrate genotypic resistance ETV five year ETV monotherapy . ( 7 ) In LAM-refractory chronic HBV patient ETV appear less potent frequency resistance increase . ( 8 , 9 ) After five year treatment 51 % LAM-refractory patient show genotypic ETV resistance , 43 % virologic breakthrough observe well . ( 7 ) Recently present promising result large European cohort patient treat ETV median period 12 month . We conclude ETV use patient prior history LAM-resistance . However , prior treatment ADV influence efficacy ETV patient . ( 10 ) HBeAg loss seroconversion In HBeAg positive patient , HBeAg loss seroconversion major objective NA treatment regime accord current guideline . HBeAg loss seroconversion usually associate sustained remission low risk development cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . ( 11-13 ) PEG-IFN induced HBeAg seroconversion show sustain 70 % 3 year follow . ( 14 ) There contradictory result concern NA induced durability HBeAg loss seroconversion . First report lamuvidine induce HBeAg loss seroconversion rather promise . ( 15-17 ) However , recent also large study report much high relapse rate predictor sustainability propose . ( 18-21 ) The registration trial entecavir show 82 % durability 24 week without consolidation therapy . ( 6 ) Recently show durability HBeAg seroconversion poor 42 % , 58 % 74 % seroreversion respectively 1,2 3 year seroconversion different NA treatment regime . However , minority patient treat new potent NA . ( 22 ) As increase number patient experience treatment failure different NA treatment regimens pose grow problem clinician , data efficacy ETV NA-experienced patient group warrant . Furthermore , current guideline subject discussion durability NA induce HBeAg loss seroconversion seem less sustain expect , prolong maybe infinite therapy may necessary prevent long term complication .</detailed_description>
