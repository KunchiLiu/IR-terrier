	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes mellitus chronic disease severe long-term health consequence . In patient type 2 diabetes mellitus also morbidly obese , abundance clinical evidence exist show significant clinical improvement diabetes occurs follow certain type bariatric , weight loss , surgical procedure . There additional data show bariatric surgical procedure bypass begin small intestine , Roux-en Y gastric bypass , markedly improve type 2 diabetes even significant weight loss occur . This early effect type 2 diabetes prior weight loss suggest bypass begin small intestine patient morbidly obese may also treat type 2 diabetes . There small study outside United States support concept treat type 2 diabetes surgical procedure bypass begin small intestine without cause significant weight loss ; however , data limit United States call comparative study make internationally . The investigator propose compare , patient morbidly obese , conventional medical treatment type 2 diabetes surgical treatment type 2 diabetes use bypass procedure cause significant weight loss , laparoscopic duodenal exclusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Surgical Treatment Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Non-Morbidly Obese Patients : A Community Hospital Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes disease glucose metabolism United States 2007 estimated effect least 17.5 million people type 2 diabetes mellitus account approximately 90 % 95 % . Poorly-controlled treat type 2 diabetes associate variety health risk , include heart disease , stroke , renal failure , amputation , blindness seventh lead cause death United States ( NDIC , National Diabetes Statistics , 2011 ) . A large number medical treatment available yet approximately 67 % patient United States type 2 diabetes unable reach level hemoglobin A1C le 6.5 % , target level set American Association Clinical Endocrinologists ( AACE , State Diabetes America , 2011 ) . In patient type 2 diabetes mellitus also morbidly obese , certain bariatric surgical procedure show improvement control type 2 diabetes addition expect weight loss effect . However , clinical investigation point mechanism weight loss improvement type 2 diabetes patient raise possibility utilize mechanism non-morbidly obese patient . Subsequent basic science research 2004 involve surgical bypass procedure proximal intestine non-obese mouse type 2 diabetes mellitus show remission diabetes majority mouse mark improvement medical treatment remain mouse ( 13 ) . Human clinical trial conduct various location worldwide produce similar result animal study ; call make study new surgical procedure treatment type 2 diabetes IRB-approved clinical trial ( 39 ) . In several study , duodenal exclusion , procedure bypass duodenum proximal jejunum leave stomach intact , show cause remission mark improvement type 2 diabetes mellitus without significant weight loss non-morbidly obese patient . However , study within United States compare effect surgical procedure upon type 2 diabetes effect conventional medical treatment type 2 diabetes control clinical trial . In clinical study , investigator propose directly compare treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus non-morbidly obese human surgical bypass duodenum proximal jejunum treatment similar group human treat conventional medical therapy . Our hypothesis non-bariatric surgical procedure , laparoscopic duodenal exclusion , provide improve treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus non-morbidly obese patient compare conventional medical treatment . The measure treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus difference expect observe glycosylated hemoglobin A1C ( HbA1C ) , fast glucose , insulin resistance . The investigator propose prospective , control , non-randomized clinical trial test hypothesis .</detailed_description>
