	<brief_summary>Metered dose inhaler spacers device capable provide high rate lung deposition drug beta agonist compare conventional nebulizer , consensus optimal dose device choice evidence young child need proportionally high dos albuterol ( μg/kg ) compare old child . Other factor may interfere response albuterol treatment include genetics beta adrenergic receptor ( ADRβ2 ) infectious etiology wheeze attack . This study ass effectiveness dose regimen prioritize high dos albuterol , dose μg/kg high young child . Security new dose regimen assess monitor clinical side effect serum level albuterol , investigator also examine presence 12 different respiratory virus patient evaluate influence ADRβ2 receptor genetics response albuterol . The primary outcome measure need hospitalization . Secondary outcome include change clinical score , respiratory rate force expiratory volume first second , need additional treatment length stay emergency room hospitalize .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double blind , control study . The patient randomly assign one treatment group ( experimental control group ) . The patient assess 1 hour later every 30 minute thereafter discharge . Following 4 hour emergency room , patient meet discharge criterion ( PRAM score ≤ 3 SpO2 ≥ 92 % ) admit hospital . Each patient 's attend physician determine need additional therapy follow first hour . Identification respiratory virus nasal lavage sample wil perform use CLART PneumoVir® kit . Albuterol plasmatic level analyze via HPLC ( High Performance Liquid Chromatography ) . To genotype ADBR2 receptor ( blood sample ) , gene region encompass Arg16Gly , Gln27Glu , Arg19Cys Thr164Ile polymorphism amplify via PCR . The resultant amplimers sequence . A sample 124 patient ( 62 group ) calculate provide 80 % power detect significant difference least 30 minute lengths stay group . The chi-square test use compare hospital admission rate tremor rate . For outcome , t-tests mean comparison ( variable normal distribution ) , Mann Whitney test ( nonparametric data ) ANOVA repeat measure use .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Aged 2 18 year ; 2 . History two previous episode wheeze treat bronchodilator last year ; 3 . Wheezing attack characterize coughing , difficulty breathe auscultation expiratory wheeze prolonged expiration ; 4 . Intensity wheeze attack define PRAM score moderate severe ( PRAM ≥ 5 ) . 1 . Preexisting chronic disease bronchopulmonary dysplasia , cystic fibrosis , bronchiolitis obliterans chronic pulmonary cardiovascular disease ; 2 . Initial clinical status indicate immediate ventilatory support , need subcutaneous intravenous bronchodilator ; 3 . Decreased level consciousness ; 4 . Using βagonist four hour prior arrival . 5 . Use corticosteroids last 24h .</criteria>
