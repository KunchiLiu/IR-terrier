The individual research network submit de-identified data central data repository subsequent analysis u . Individual research network submit protocol review IRBs order collect patient-specific data , conduct intervention , submit de-identified data central repository . By combine data fund project able answer question individual project would able answer . The analysis use combine set data gain statistical power sufficient test hypotheses interest , determine distribution response select measure patient primary care practice , assess impact type intervention , compare impact different type intervention , determine measure use routinely , conclude useful , , select measure Prescription Health project . Statistical analysis include basic descriptive statistic distribution score baseline follow-up complex hierarchical linear modeling , seek understand effect multi-site study ( across site group site ) . We directly evaluate specific research network intervention , assess part large group . This study report aggregate result name individual primary care practice research network .</detailed_description>
