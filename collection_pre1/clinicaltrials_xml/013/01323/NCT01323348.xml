	<brief_title>Effect Diabetes Education During Retinal Ophthalmology Visits Diabetes Control</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although patient diabetes receive diabetic education part on-going routine medical care , likely education deliver different detail intensity . Motivating patient diabetes become involve care primary importance achieve good systemic control . Ocular complication diabetes remain common cause blindness among American adult 20-74 year age . A recent survey report loss vision fear diabetic complication . Thus , possible educational intervention ophthalmology office may additional impact beyond current standard diabetes education primary care diabetologist/endocrinologist office alone . This study determine whether diabetes education ophthalmology office ( include same-visit feedback HbA1c level , combine standardized education regard same-visit blood pressure , retinopathy status overall diabetes education ) improve subsequent HbA1c compare current standard care ophthalmology office . Materials use research set must applicable use ophthalmology practice . Therefore , material procedure study developed goal easy translation audience .</detailed_description>
