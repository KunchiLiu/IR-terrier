	<brief_summary>Doxycycline know exhibit immune modulatory activity beyond antibacterial effect . In particular , doxycycline potent inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase 9 , protease derive largely neutrophils . Recent study demonstrate significant correlation pulmonary disease severity sputum concentration MMP-9 patient CF . In addition , sputum MMP-9 level associate airway remodel CF . The goal study determine therapeutic potential doxycycline modulate host airway inflammation patient CF . Specifically , study characterize PK /PD doxycycline , evaluate safety short term therapy , explore concentration effect relationship doxycycline exposure sputum biomarker level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist prospective , open-label , randomize , control trial conduct 24 patient cystic fibrosis . Twenty subject stratify 1:2 ratio base baseline FEV1 mild ( &gt; 70 % ) moderate ( 40-70 % ) pulmonary disease order control disease severity within dose level . The subject randomize block four receive drug , 40mg , 100mg , 200mg daily 28 day . Sputum sample obtain group induction hypertonic saline baseline , 8 , 24 , 48 hour follow first dose weekly 4 week . Sputum also collect two follow visit treatment period week 5 6 . In doxycycline group , serial blood sample ( 5 mL ) determination doxycycline concentration obtain 0 , 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 12 , 24 , 48 hour follow 1-hr infusion single IV dose . Once daily dose doxycycline resume immediately follow 48-hour blood sample continue day 28 . Additional level obtain pre-dose , 1 , 2 , 3 hour dos administer day 14 28 . A sample blood obtain baseline , day 28 inflammatory marker analysis .</detailed_description>
