	<brief_title>An Exercise Endurance Study Evaluate Effects Treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Patients With Dual Bronchodilator : GSK573719/GW642444.Study B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Expiratory airflow limitation obvious physiological change associate chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . A consequence airflow limitation gas trap expiration becomes flow limit . This may occur rest severe airway obstruction evident exercise lung empty reduce increase ventilation allow full expiration . This increase gas trap hyperinflation cause much increase work breathing , dyspnea , exercise intolerance subject COPD ( O'Donnell 1997 ; O'Donnell , 1993 ) . Spirometric measurement airflow limitation , particularly assess forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , commonly use diagnosis assessment response pharmacotherapeutic intervention COPD . However , change FEV1 may fully predict symptomatic response alternative measure lung hyperinflation exercise tolerance exertional dyspnea may sensitive therapeutic intervention and/or clinically relevant FEV1 [ O'Donnell1999 ; Bauerle , 1998 ; O'Donnell , 1998 ; Officer , 1998 ] . GSK573719/GW642444 Inhalation Powder , combination long-acting muscarinic antagonist ( LAMA ) bronchodilator GSK573719 long-acting beta2-agonist ( LABA ) bronchodilator GW642444 , development maintenance treatment airflow obstruction associate COPD . Development product support study show improvement lung function similar safety use combination long-acting bronchodilator different mechanism action compare single bronchodilator therapy [ van Noord 2005 ; van Noord van Noord 2006 ; Tashkin 2008 ] . Previous study demonstrate treatment short- long-acting bronchodilator include ipratropium , tiotropium , salmeterol reduces rest lung hyperinflation measure functional residual capacity ( FRC ) , residual volume ( RV ) , inspiratory capacity ( IC ) , associated improvement exercise endurance time exertional dyspnoea subject COPD [ Ayers , 2001 ; O'Donnell 1998 ; O'Donnell 2004 ; Pepin 2005 ; Pepin 2007 ; Ramirez-Venegas 1997 ] . However , effect combine LAMA/LABA therapy measure well characterize . This phase III multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , combination component , two-period , incomplete block design cross-over study use GSK573719/GW642444 . The primary objective evaluate lung function exercise endurance time 12 week once-daily administration GSK573719/GW642444 Inhalation Powder ( 125/25mcg 62.5/25mcg ) , GSK573719 Inhalation Powder ( 125mcg 62.5mcg ) , GW642444 Inhalation Powder 25 mcg placebo deliver Novel dry powder inhaler ( Novel DPI ) Approximately 312 subject moderate/severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) randomise order achieve 208 subject complete treatment period 3 months.. There total 12 study clinic visit conduct outpatient basis . Subjects meet eligibility criterion Screening ( Visit 1 ) complete 12 21 day run-in period follow two 12-week treatment period separate 14 day wash-out . Clinic visit conduct Screening ( Visit 1 ) , twice run-in period ( Visits 2 3 ) , randomization ( Visit 4 ) three time first treatment period , Treatment Day 2 ( Visit 5 ) 6 12 week ( Visits 6 7 respectively ) . During washout period 14 day 2 clinic visit ( Visits 8 9 ) . During second treatment period 3 clinic visit , Treatment Day 2 ( Visit 10 ) 6 12 week ( Visits 11 12 respectively ) . A Safety Follow-Up assessment ( Visit 13 ) record adverse event conduct telephone 7 day end second treatment period early withdrawal . Efficacy measurement include pre post dose FEV1 , lung volume measurement exercise endurance time measure use endurance shuttle walk test ( ESWT ) . Safety tolerability assess collection adverse event ( AEs ) , vital sign , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , clinical laboratory test incidence COPD exacerbation . Dyspnea assess use Exercise Dyspnea Scale ( EDS ) , patient-reported outcome . Blood sample also collect potential pharmacogenetics analysis</detailed_description>
