	<brief_summary>Background : - Uric acid substance find blood may contribute certain chronic medical condition disorder , diabetes , insulin resistance , high blood pressure . High uric acid concentration associate stroke heart disease , well chronic heart failure . In particular , researcher interested determine relationship uric acid inflammatory marker , chemical blood indicate inflammation problem body . Objectives : - To study specific effect change uric acid body . - To determine whether uric acid contributes inflammation body . Eligibility : - Healthy individual 50 75 year age . Design : - This study involve four visit : screen visit , two study visit , followup visit . - At screen visit , participant physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram . Participants divide two group base exist amount uric acid blood . - Within 7 day screen visit , participant full-day study visit magnetic resonance imaging scan , follow high-fat meal blood sample collect follow 8 hour . - At least 2 day first study visit , participant second study visit , require 2-night stay National Institutes Health . Participants metabolism test , receive follow infusion base group assign screen visit . - Group A ( low uric acid ) receive either uric acid placebo . - Group B ( moderate high uric acid ) receive either Rasburicase ( drug reduces amount uric acid blood ) placebo . - After infusion related blood test , participant high-fat meal blood urine sample . - Approximately 2 week second study visit , participant final followup visit additional blood urine test determine whether level uric acid blood return normal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Uric acid ( UA ) terminal product purine metabolism strong antioxidant property . UA sizeable concentration biologic fluid human primates non-functional mutation enzyme uricase , animal , transforms UA allantoin . It hypothesize mutation emerge evolutionarily mechanism , human counteract excessive oxidative stress occur many critical pathologic condition . Partially contrast theory , high level UA associate number negative health outcome , include cardiovascular well all-cause mortality . Although possible UA elevation merely marker critical health inducible antioxidant , researcher question whether UA beneficial detrimental effect health status . For example , recently demonstrate high UA level cross-sectionally associate high level pro-inflammatory marker , predict increase inflammatory marker 3-year follow-up . Understanding whether UA exerts protective detrimental effect health important decide whether mild hyperuricemia aggressively treat . Unfortunately , observational study fully address question . In fact , exclude cross-sectional longitudinal association UA , inflammatory marker negative health outcome , may simply reflect fact UA inducible antioxidant produce response increase oxidative stress . To verify hypothesis UA activate inflammation , plan conduct two complementary randomize controlled trial , one include 10 treated 10 control subject . In first trial , subject low UA administer 500 mg UA intravenously . In second trial , subject moderately elevate UA administer single acute dose Rasburicase . Then inflammatory marker measure multiple point time , total 32 hour . We hypothesize acute increase circulating level UA follow increase level inflammatory marker . At time , acute reduction UA level follow progressive reduction inflammatory marker . This study provide information help clinician decide whether treat mild hyperuricemia .</detailed_description>
