	<brief_summary>A correlation increase norepinephrine concentration central nervous system ( CNS ) decrease fibromyalgia pain suggest clinical study . Therefore , pro-drug norepinephrine , droxidopa could potentially benefit fibromyalgia patient reduce pain result increase CNS level norepinephrine . As benefit presumed central effect , addition carbidopa , peripheral DOPA decarboxylase ( DDC ) inhibitor , may favorably impact drug 's treatment profile . Carbidopa utilized blocker peripheral DDC , enzyme require conversion droxidopa norepinephrine . Therefore , inhibition peripheral DDC result reduction side effect result peripheral production norepinephrine , whilst allow increased central level , hence , increase centrally mediate benefit . The purpose study obtain information regard proper dosing , effectiveness safety droxidopa combination droxidopa/carbidopa treatment patient fibromyalgia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study To Assess The Clinical Benefit Of Droxidopa And Droxidopa/Carbidopa In Subjects With Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) Chronic widespread pain ( CWP ) two syndrome within broad class know functional somatic syndrome . Chronic widespread pain ( CWP ) define accord American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) , pain waist involve side body last least 3 month . Fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) , subset CWP , multisystem disease characterize sleep disturbance , fatigue , headache , morning stiffness , paresthesia , anxiety . While debate specific etiology pathogenesis , fibromyalgia generally believe result perturbation central pain processing , specifically neuroendocrine system . Fibromyalgia patient show low level metabolite three neurotransmitter ( serotonin , norepinephrine , dopamine ) cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) compare healthy control . The low rate turnover neurotransmitter support hypothesis metabolic defect fibromyalgia suggests defect occur neuroregulatory level . Results study examine effect permanent reduction noradrenergic innervation spinal cord suggest antinociceptive effect norepinephrine closely link opioidergic tachykinergic neurotransmission . Droxidopa [ also , know L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine , L-threo-DOPS , L-DOPS ] International non-proprietary name ( INN ) synthetic amino acid precursor norepinephrine ( NE ) , originally develop Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Co. , Limited , Japan . It approve use Japan since 1989 . Droxidopa show improve symptom orthostatic hypotension result variety condition include Shy Drager syndrome ( Multiple System Atrophy ) , Pure Autonomic Failure , Parkinson 's disease . There four stereoisomers DOPS ; however , L-threo-enantiomer ( droxidopa ) biologically active . Data clinical study post-marketing surveillance program conduct Japan show commonly report adverse drug reaction droxidopa increase blood pressure , nausea , headache . In clinical study date , data suggests droxidopa well-tolerated effective norepinephrine precursor . Pre-clinical clinical study suggest droxidopa analgesic effect patient chronic pain . An increase central nervous system ( CNS ) level norepinephrine show correlate analgesic effect . Based pre-clinical clinical finding date , hypothesize droxidopa provide pain reduction fibromyalgia patient increase CNS level norepinephrine . Carbidopa DOPA decarboxylase ( DDC ) inhibitor . At therapeutic dos carbidopa cross blood-brain barrier therefore inhibit CNS metabolism droxidopa NE . Decreasing activity DDC periphery enable droxidopa metabolism focus CNS . This CNS focus increase CNS response also limit increase blood pressure associate peripheral droxidopa metabolism . In addition , DDC enzyme require conversion droxidopa active metabolite norepinephrine , inhibition peripheral DDC , utilize Carbidopa , result reduction side effect result peripheral production NE , whilst allow increased central level , hence , increase centrally mediate benefit . The primary objective study determine efficacy droxidopa droxidopa/carbidopa treatment pain associate fibromyalgia . Secondary objective include : evaluation effect droxidopa combination droxidopa/carbidopa sign symptom fibromyalgia , evaluation effect droxidopa combination droxidopa/carbidopa overall quality life fibromyalgia patient , evaluation dose-response relationship droxidopa different dos droxidopa , carbidopa combination droxidopa/carbidopa fibromyalgia patient , evaluation clinical benefit treatment different dos droxidopa , carbidopa combination droxidopa/carbidopa fibromyalgia patient , estimation optimal dose relief fibromyalgia pain use response surface methodology , evaluation safety droxidopa droxidopa/carbidopa treatment .</detailed_description>
