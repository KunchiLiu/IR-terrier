	<detailed_description>2 . Overview design analysis [ per CONSORT 2010 ] 2.1 Trial design [ CONSORT 3a ] The study three-arm cluster randomize trial , two intervention arm control arm . The primary justification intervene village level individual level randomization , would entail treatment control live side-by-side village , could lead conflict within village . 2.2 Study Participants [ CONSORT 4a , 4b ] The study take place catchment area Kintampo Health Research Centre . This comprise population 146,000 . The study population primarily rural agricultural , cook primarily biomass fuel . The study area well describe Owusu-Agyei et al . 2012 ( 38 ) . A cluster eligible participate : - Is locate Kintampo North South Districts ( core study area KHRC ) - Is primarily rural ( practice , exclude Kintampo , small city approximately 40,000 people ) ; - Is operationally feasible ( practice , exclude handful small , isolated cluster would present extraordinary logistical challenge ) ; - Is home woman primarily deliver one four staffed birth facility ( practice exclude one village edge study area , woman travel another district delivery ) . A woman eligible participate study : - Is first second trimester pregnancy ( gestational age ≤ 24 week gestation ; ensure intervention actually deliver prior 27 week ) - Is carry live singleton fetus ( twin exclude ) - Is primary cook household compound ; - Is non-smoker . 2.3 Interventions [ CONSORT 5 ] The study three arm : 1 . LPG intervention arm , household receive two burner LPG cookstove monthly gas delivery ; 2 . An efficient biomass arm , household receive two BioLite cookstove ; 3 . A control arm 2.4 Outcomes [ CONSORT 6a ] The primary health outcome measure study : 1 . Infant weight birth , 2 . Physician assess pneumonia . Baseline assessment outcomes No baseline data ALRI prevalence Ghana available . Our study thus provide valuable baseline data regard important disease . KHRC , course conduct research project , capture information regard birth weight ; statistic calculate data use input power calculation . These data describe ( 39 ) . 2.5 Sample size [ CONSORT 7a , 7b ] For three-arm design , calculate need enroll household achieve target 1225 birth ( assume 85 % pregnancy result record birth , account move , drop , still birth rate ) . These spread across 35 cluster , outline follow table . Clusters Births Enrollment BioLite 13 455 525 Control 13 455 525 LPG 9 315 365 total 35 1225 1415</detailed_description>
