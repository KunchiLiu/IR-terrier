	<detailed_description>This study ass whether FDA approve treatment take 14-days least 85 % effective eradicating H. pylorus infection . The study participant - Adults age 18-65 year - Able provide write informed consent - Who meet inclusion inclusion criterion Females Reproductive Potential If female subject becomes pregnant study , study drug discontinue immediately subject follow outcome pregnancy know . If pregnancy occur , report unexpected AE .

A baseline breath sample collect start interview subject give 150 ml drink contain citric acid 75 mg 13C-urea . After 20 minute , second breath bag collect . - Culture Helicobacter pylorus Baylor brush cutoff place 1 ml cysteine transport medium 20 % glycerol store -70 C process Laboratory co-I Dr. Graham culture medium consist horse blood agar ( HBA ) plate ( nonselective medium ) HBA plate contain 10 μg/ml nalidixic acid , 5 μg/ml trimethoprim , 3 μg/ml , vancomycin 2 μg/ml amphotericin B ( selective medium ) .
