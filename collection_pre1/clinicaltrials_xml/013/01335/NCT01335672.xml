	<brief_summary>An estimate three million people affected chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) UK , give prevalence 1.5 % population 2007/08 . COPD account approximately 30,000 death year UK important co-morbidity die smoking related disease , commonly ischaemic heart disease lung cancer . The National COPD audit show high level co-morbidity , association cardiovascular disease particularly strong 51 % patient cardiovascular disease admit COPD within precede 24 month . Patients COPD increase risk myocardial infarction compare general population . Although increase cardiovascular risk exists , clear whether survival myocardial infarction different patient without COPD factor contribute survival difference . Differences survival may arise due difference prescribe certain drug beta-blockers , difference prevalence risk factor ( e.g . current smoking status ) increase COPD event exacerbation associate increased mortality . The investigator primary aim investigate whether survival first myocardial infarction shorter patient COPD without COPD establish reason difference survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Survival After First Myocardial Infarction Patients With Without Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study part CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) programme fund 5 year NIHR Wellcome Trust . The central theme CALIBER research linkage Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) primary care ( GPRD ) resource . The overarch aim CALIBER good understand aetiology prognosis specific coronary phenotype across range causal domain , particularly electronic record provide contribution beyond traditional study . CALIBER receive Ethics approval ( ref 09/H0810/16 ) ECC approval ( ref ECC 2-06 ( b ) /2009 CALIBER dataset ) . Objectives : 1 . To investigate survival difference first myocardial infarction patient without COPD . 2 . To investigate survival difference exist due ) difference prevalence risk factor ( e.g . smoking ) b ) differences management myocardial infarction ( e.g . uptake cardiac rehabilitation , prescription beta-blockers ) c ) COPD related event ( e.g . exacerbation ) .</detailed_description>
