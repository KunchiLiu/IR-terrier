	<brief_summary>It important assess patient ' fitness major cancer surgery carry high risk mortality . Patients poor heart lung function high risk death major cancer surgery . Cardiopulmonary exercise testing , CPET , objective measure patient ' fitness . Most patient , surgery resect cancer , undergo period chemotherapy . Chemotherapy often regress cancer also adverse effect cell function . Our hypothesis chemotherapy alters patient fitness , assess CPET , prior major cancer surgery . Participating patient undergo fitness test CPET chemotherapy , prior surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Chemotherapy Lactate Threshold Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : To evaluate effect chemotherapy pre−operative fitness patient prior major cancer surgery . Design : Patients act case−control . Patients consent early available opportunity follow decision surgically treatable disease consent pre−operative NAC . Consent study gain outpatient . At `` visit 1 '' patient undergo CPET , current standard practice , prior commence neoadjuvant chemotherapy . As part assessment , pulmonary function test ( static lung volume , lung diffuse capacity ) , nutritional assessment use bioimpedance measurement . They undergo 3 cycle NAC last total 6 week , standard current practice institution . At `` visit 2 '' , approximately four six week follow chemotherapy prior plan surgery CPET assessment repeat . This also current standard practice institution . Data visit 1 visit 2 compare paired manner . A statistician consult assess degree normality data , statistical test use , power calculation . At point treatment postpone change solely purpose collect data research . 12 month survival assess outcome variable .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Consenting patient surgically resectable oesophageal gastric cancer refer tertiary NHS referral service deem clinician suitable pre−operative neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( NAC ) prior plan surgery . Patients cancer deem surgically non−resectable disease , patient refuse chemotherapy , patient unable perform cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) due coincident illness condition ( e.g . arthritis ) , patient refuse surgery , patient withhold consent . Patients unable give inform consent due mental incapacity . Prisoners exclude . Patients haemoglobin drop &gt; 2g/dl Visit 1 visit 2 .</criteria>
