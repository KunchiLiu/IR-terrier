	<detailed_description>Critical illness due severe sepsis trauma major cause morbidity mortality , substantial economic burden United States worldwide . Despite advance clinical care , patient sepsis trauma-associated respiratory failure represent specific population high rate adverse outcomes . The etiology respiratory failure patient severe sepsis trauma multifactorial , acute lung injury ( ALI ) one lead cause , associate prolong ICU hospital stay , mortality , long-term sequela . Other general supportive care , specific intervention lung protective ventilation show improve outcome patient . New approach understand pathogenesis develop good therapy urgently need . Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) syndrome consist acute hypoxemic respiratory failure bilateral pulmonary infiltrates associate pulmonary nonpulmonary risk factor ( eg . sepsis , trauma ) due primarily leave atrial hypertension . Although distinction ALI severe subtype ( term acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) make , pathogenesis , risk factor , outcomes appear similar purpose protocol , term acute lung injury [ ALI ] use encompass entity . Accepted consensus definition ALI introduce widely use laboratory clinical investigation ALI . Acute Lung Injury ( ALI ) define : - PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 300 - Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates chest x-ray - Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure &lt; 18mmHg clinical evidence increase left atrial pressure Although broad range risk factor ALI describe , account majority case include : sepsis , pneumonia , trauma , aspiration . It well establish severe trauma recognize precipitating cause ALI . Recent study demonstrate incidence acute lung injury ( ALI ) much high previously think , estimate age-adjusted incidence 86 per 100,000 person per year , result estimate ~190,000 case annually US . The clinical health care system impact ALI substantial , estimate 2,154,000 intensive care unit ( ICU ) day , 3,622,000 hospital day , 75,000 death 2000 , expect grow significantly give mark age-related incidence age population . Although general improvement ICU care last 2 decade lead trend towards low mortality due certain ALI-associated risk factor ( trauma , aspiration ) , common cause ALI , sepsis pneumonia , remain associated high mortality rate ~25-35 % . Mortality ALI commonly due secondary infections/sepsis multiorgan system failure rather primary respiratory failure due hypoxemia , highlight systemic nature ALI . Even among initial survivor ALI , substantial pulmonary nonpulmonary functional impairment remain month year . Specifically , proportion survive initial insult risk prolong mechanical ventilation ICU/hospital stay , risk factor remain poorly define . It hypothesize `` 2nd hit '' may predispose certain patient great morbidity set . Despite intensive basic clinical investigation , single intervention ( low-tidal volume [ `` lung protective '' ] ventilation ) generally accept decrease mortality ALI , multiple strategy fail improve survival either early clinical study definitive efficacy trial . Thus , give high incidence continue substantial clinical impact ALI despite improvement general medical/ICU care , limit proven option lung-protective ventilation , new approach understand pathophysiology identify novel target intervention ALI high priority . Overly intense , persistent dysregulated pulmonary systemic inflammation emerge leading hypothesis pathogenesis ALI complication , contributory factor mechanisms incompletely define . Several carefully-conducted prospective human study show association specific inflammatory biomarkers blood BALF ( initial level onset change time ) important clinical outcome ALI . [ Animal model also demonstrate association inflammatory cytokine non-pulmonary organ injury dysfunction ] In addition , one important intervention ( low-tidal volume [ `` lung protective '' ] ventilation ) show decrease mortality ALI associate reduction inflammatory cytokine ( IL-6 , IL-8 ) blood bronchoalveolar lavage fluid [ BALF ] . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) ubiquitous virus human worldwide , link adverse clinical outcome include prolongation mechanical ventilation , increase length stay , mortality multiple study critically-ill , apparently immunocompetent , seropositive adult . Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) human herpes virus know infect 50-90 % US adult know major cause morbidity mortality immunocompromised patient . CMV infection acquire multiple mean , include : mother-to-child ( utero , breast milk ) , infect body fluid ( saliva , genital secretion ) , blood transfusion organ transplant . The prevalence CMV infection increase age throughout life age 90 , ~90 % person acquire CMV infection . In immunocompetent person , follow primary infection route note , CMV control immune system establishes latency ( `` dormancy '' ) multiple organs/cell-types life host . In particular , lung represent one large reservoir latent CMV seropositive host , may explain propensity CMV-associated pulmonary disease predispose host . During period immunosuppression ( result specific stimuli TNF-Î± , LPS , catecholamines commonly associate critical illness &amp; sepsis [ CMV reactivate latency ( preferentially lung ) produce active infection ( viral replication ) . In person impaired cellular immunity , reactivation progress high-grade CMV replication commonly lead tissue injury clinically-evident disease CMV pneumonia . Lower-grade CMV reactivation otherwise clinically silent ( `` subclinical '' ) also detect apparently immunocompetent person critical illness use sensitive technique PCR . In addition , even low-level , otherwise asymptomatic subclinical CMV reactivation produce significant biologic effect vitro vivo , inflammation , fibrosis immunosuppression . Each biologic effect subclinical CMV infection either previously demonstrate ( inflammation , fibrosis ) could theoretically important ( immunosuppression ) sepsis-associated ALI complication . These biological effect CMV show occur various mediator indirect mean [ Importantly , several important CMV-associated adverse clinical outcome transplant population [ allograft rejection , secondary infection ] necessarily accompany overt CMV disease detect relatively sensitive mean virus detection PCR . Reactivation CMV apparently immunocompetent patient critical illness due broad range cause document multiple prior study use variety virologic technique . The specific trigger CMV reactivation latency identify know elevated patient sepsis acute lung injury [ A prospective study intubate patient sepsis Germany report 60 % rate CMV DNA detection tracheal aspirate . In addition CMV reactivation sepsis , CMV reactivation also demonstrate specifically lung blood patient acute lung injury . Retrospectively test sample collect prospective observational cohort study patient risk develop ARDS , CMV reactivation ( ie . CMV DNA PCR ) detect BALF and/or plasma 2/5 [ 40 % ] subject develop ARDS , sequential sample 7/20 [ 35 % ] patient ARDS , patient risk develop ARDS ( 0/5 ) [ Limaye 2009 unpublished data ] . In separate study , CMV reactivation retrospectively assess PCR BALF 88 subject enrol randomized trial fish oil treatment ALI . Seropositivity baseline ( ie . evidence latent CMV infection ) cohort 65 % ( similar prior age-related estimate ) , CMV reactivation ( ie . CMV DNA PCR ) detect BALF 12/57 [ 21 % ] patient [ Limaye unpublished data 2009 ] . Several line evidence link CMV reactivation adverse clinical outcome non-immunosuppressed adult critical illness . In recent meta-analysis , CMV reactivation ( compare reactivation ) associate 2-fold increased odds mortality ICU patient . In addition mortality , recent study demonstrate strong independent association CMV reactivation increase hospital ICU length stay duration mechanical ventilation .</detailed_description>
