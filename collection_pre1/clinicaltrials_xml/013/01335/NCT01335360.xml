	<brief_summary>This study would prospective cohort study , stratify weight . Patients stable nevirapine least 3 month prior study entry , 1year recruit . For 1 week , subject take morning dose nevirapine clinic ( observed taking ) , give even dose take home . Subjects need record date time take evening dose . At end week , subject sequester clinic blood draw 12hr pharmacokinetic sample . They bring back 24hrs need redo 12hrs . They Liver Function Tests ( LFT 's ) lab drawn study entry , one month end study . Pharmacokinetic level analyze use standard mathematical model , Area Under Curve ( AUC ) , Maximum concentration ( Cmax ) , Minimum Concentration ( Cmin ) compare group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , cohort study . 8 patient 3 weight range ( &lt; 160lb , 161-200lb , &gt; 200lb ) recruit participate study . Subjects HIV + patient currently stable therapy nevirapine ( medication least 3 month minimal self-reported adherence ) part combination regimen Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection ( prescribed primary care provider ) . Subjects good health liver function test &lt; 2 time normal limit , measure within 1 month prior study period . All subject male . The reason gender bias follow : gender use , equal number male female subject remove bias data . Since enough female take nevirapine able appropriately recruit , female exclude . Subjects ask take medication night study period 8:00pm 8:30pm , ask abstain alcohol 7 day prior study . On study day , report Jeffrey Goodman Special Care Clinic 7:30 , prior breakfast . Subjects randomly divide 4 group study period . Four healthcare professional ( one physician , one family nurse practitioner , one register nurse one license vocational nurse , present throughout study catheter insertion blood draw . IV catheter insert upon arrival , four patient ( one group ) time zero receive study medication time point 8:00 , 8:05 , 8:10 , 8:15 , 8:20 , 8:25 ( allow appropriate work-flow blood draw portion study . Serial blood sample draw dose follow time : 0.5hr , 1hr , 1.5hr , 2hr , 4hr , 6hr , 8hr , 12hr . Subjects allow eat breakfast ( supply study personnel ) After 1hr blood sample . Lunch dinner also available study subject . 12hr sample , catheter remove subject allow leave ( subject allow leave premise catheter place ) . Subjects pay $ 250 participation conclusion study . Consolidated Laboratory Services analyze blood sample nevirapine level . AUC 's AUC comparison calculate appropriate statistical software ( Systat ) . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Levels : Levels draw prior dosing , following time interval : 0.5hr , 1hr , 1.5hr , 2hr , 4hr , 6hr , 8hr , 12hr . ~10cc blood drawn sample , centrifuge , plasma separate 2 cryovials . Samples frozen -20oC . All sample ( 216 ) send Consolidated Laboratory Services level determination appropriate mean . Safety monitoring : A licensed physician license family nurse practitioner site entire study . All study personnel certify Basic Life Support ( Advanced Cardiac Life Support ) . The clinic facility equip minor emergency 911 utilized major emergency . Statistics : AUC 's calculated use non-linear mathematical model statistical software . AUC 's compare use appropriate statistical test . Evaluation Adverse Events : All adverse event record treat ( necessary ) site . Adverse event able treat site refer emergency room primary provider follow day ( urgent ) .</detailed_description>
