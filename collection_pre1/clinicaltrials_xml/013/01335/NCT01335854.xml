	<brief_summary>The propose research evaluate new approach improve ability patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , breathe disorder sleep , use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , medical device wear sleep treat OSA . 120 patient newly diagnose OSA initiate CPAP treatment assign one 3 group : usual care , usual care web-based access daily CPAP adherence , usual care web-based access daily CPAP adherence financial incentive use CPAP least 4 hours/day first week treatment . Measures CPAP use , daytime sleepiness , quality life evaluate whether patient provide web-based access daily CPAP adherence without financial incentive great objectively measure average daily hour CPAP use great improvement functional outcome follow 3 month treatment compare patient receive usual care . The result test hypothesis behavioral intervention improve patient adherence CPAP critically important first week treatment many patient decide whether use CPAP initial level adherence maintain long term despite withdrawal financial incentive .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Promoting Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This nested clinical study NIH fund research project RC2AG036592 , `` Developing Interactive Technology Improve Research Health Behavior '' . The purpose research project create web-based infrastructure accelerate research behavioral economics improve health . Failure adhere medical treatment major cause poor outcome increase health care spending . Changing unhealthful behavior difficult . One barrier behavioral change need provide patient immediate , timely information behavior . Individual clinician maintain frequent contact require , technology automate feedback mechanism keep issue salient patient . Internet technology increasingly see appeal tool overcome barrier promote patient self-management . Recent evidence indicate provide patient web-based feedback health status may improve adherence treatment outcomes . Another barrier behavioral change people need frequent reinforcement positive behavior need reinforcement often time make decision ( e.g. , smoke , overeat , take medication ) . Recent study report use financial incentive effective strategy change health behavior . Incentives form direct payment provide valuable positive reinforcement show change health behavior variety context , include weight loss , medication adherence , smoke cessation . One criticism approach change health behavior whether new behavior sustain financial incentive withdrawn . The propose clinical study use web-based infrastructure develop research project evaluate application emerge new approach behavioral health intervention improve CPAP adherence consequent treatment outcomes patient OSA . In propose research study , 120 patient newly diagnose OSA initiate CPAP therapy randomize one three arm : 1 ) usual care , 2 ) usual care ability participant view report his/her daily CPAP use password protect website , 3 ) usual care ability participant view report his/her daily CPAP use password protect website combined daily financial incentive first week base hour per day CPAP use . The propose health behavior intervention 1 ) provide patient great access information sleep disorder breathing , 2 ) allow patient become active member management team . Aim 1 determine propose health behavior intervention improve average daily hour CPAP use first week follow 3 month treatment . The overall hypothesis behavioral intervention improve patient adherence CPAP critically important first week treatment many patient decide whether use CPAP initial level adherence maintain long term despite withdrawal financial incentive . Interventions design improve health-related behavior justify lead great improvement clinically relevant outcome . To determine impact propose health behavior intervention increase CPAP adherence treatment outcome , Aim 2 compare measure daytime function follow 3 month CPAP treatment across three group . The result Aim 2 demonstrate whether improvement CPAP adherence due web-based feedback without financial incentive result great improvement clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
