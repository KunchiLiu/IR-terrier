	<brief_summary>Background : Approximately 1.9 million Canadians live diabetes estimate increase 75 % next decade . Pharmacists front line primary healthcare professional see patient diabetes frequently Alberta , allow prescribe medication order laboratory test . As , pharmacist could systematically identify poorly control diabetes patient provide great access diabetes intervention improve blood sugar control . Objective : The aim study determine effect community pharmacist intervention blood sugar control individual poorly control diabetes . Project description : 100 adult type 2 diabetes uncontrolled blood sugar define participate pharmacist . Blood sugar control go assess use hemoglobin A1c test ( blood test measure individual 's blood sugar control last 3 month ) . This test require obtain blood spot patient obtain prick his/her fingertip . Based hemoglobin A1c test result pharmacist ass patient 's need insulin glargine , patient need insulin glargine pharmacist go prescribe him/her educate him/her use . Patients go follow closely pharmacists 6 month regular updates patient ' family physician . This multi-centre study demonstrate pharmacist ' ability improve glycemic control improve access care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND/RATIONALE : Approximately 1.9 million Canadians live diabetes . Estimates number increase 75 % next decade . Glycemic control patient type 2 diabetes mellitus poor , poorly control patient contribute significantly cost primary health care Canada . 10 % acute care hospital admission 2006 attribute diabetes complication . As type 2 diabetes progressive disease , patient type 2 diabetes eventually require insulin . In patient present type 2 diabetes HbA1C 9 % , insulin start immediately , however , historically physicians generally perceive patient difficulty start insulin therapy . INSIGHT demonstrate improved glycemic control addition insulin glargine oral hypoglycemic agent patient type 2 diabetes . However , physician often reluctant initiate insulin patient . In addition , physician system systematically identify potential candidate insulin add-on therapy Pharmacists front line primary care professional see patient diabetes frequently family physician , could systematically proactively identify patient type 2 diabetes poor glycemic control public health approach chronic disease management . This approach use successfully group past dyslipidemia hypertension management involve patient diabetes . The scope practice pharmacist change , legislation Alberta ( soon province ) allow pharmacist prescribe Schedule I medication order laboratory test . As , opportunity provide great access , convenience improve glycemic control engage community pharmacists patient . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To determine effect community pharmacist prescribe intervention glycemic control patient poorly control type 2 diabetes . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To determine effect pharmacist-directed diabetes care focus glycemic control : - patient satisfaction - quality life - dosage change oral agent - persistence insulin glargine end follow-up - hypoglycemic episode - To conduct health economic assessment cost benefit intervention METHODS : Design : multicentre pragmatic before-after design trial Setting : Ten community pharmacy Alberta recruitment follow-up , engage patient family physicians • participate pharmacist additional prescribing authorization . For pharmacist additional prescribing authorization , facilitate application do rural RxACTION study . Recruitment : Pharmacists systematically identify potential candidate invite patient type 2 diabetes receive oral hypoglycemic medication check HbA1c use point care test . HbA1c go measure pharmacy . The patient sign first stage consent form order get his/her HbA1c measure . After sign consent form , patient 's HbA1c measure use digital meter require blood spot gain prick patient 's fingertip . If result HbA1c test normal patient give his/her result tell keep good work . If result HbA1c test high ( 7.5-11 % ) patient meet inclusion criterion study patient ask he/she want participate study . If patient agrees participate study he/she ask sign second stage consent form . After sign consent form patient start insulin glargine bedtime taught use insulin pen . If HbA1c &gt; 11 % patient assess study investigator , treatment recommendation check refer his/her family physician . Follow-up : Patients follow 2 , 4 , 8 , 14 , 20 , 26 week capture adverse event , adherence insulin regimen , fast blood sugar ( measure patient ) , insulin dose titration . HbA1c measure baseline week 14 visit week 26 . Interim telephone follow-up may perform discretion pharmacist investigator , however telephone follow-up use 2 consecutive visit , week 14 26 visit . Fasting glucose measure discretion pharmacist patient monitor blood glucose home record standard patient diary . After follow study pharmacist go inform patient 's family physician change patient 's treatment regimen also result test conduct . One year final follow visit , pharmacy go receive phone call study investigator check patient still take insulin .</detailed_description>
