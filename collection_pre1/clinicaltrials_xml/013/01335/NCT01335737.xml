	<brief_title>Exercise Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aerobic exercise - widely recommend health behavior - recognize reduce risk coronary heart disease , much consensus panel routinely include part cardioprotective regimen healthy people , physiological mechanistic basis protection uncertain . Understanding mechanisms considerable public health significance allow development testing target intervention produce comparable cardioprotective effect directly case aerobic exercise possible . This application propose test hypothesis aerobic training lead attenuation inflammatory response LPS stimulation examine role play exercise-induced increase vagal activity , improvement mood , decrease expression Toll Receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) , cognate receptor endotoxin express monocyte .</detailed_description>
