	<brief_summary>Sorafenib standard therapy advance liver cancer often show dose-limiting toxicity need reduce apply dose compound . As limit overall response rate therapy , combination temsirolimus , inhibitor mTOR signaling , investigate regard safety tolerability patient advance liver cancer reduce dose sorafenib .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temsirolimus + Sorafenib Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhibitors PI3K/Akt mTOR signal pathway recently establish novel potent anti-cancer agent solid hematologic malignancy . Several pre-clinical report show good anti-tumor activity different HCC model first report clinical trial HCC promise good efficacy inhibit angiogenesis tumor cell growth . mTOR inhibition also show enhance activity cytotoxic agent . Sorafenib also interfere tumor cell survival , proliferation angiogenesis inhibit molecular pathway independent PI3K/Akt/mTOR signal . We therefore expect least additive effect inhibit two parallel independent intracellular pathway HCC tumor cell prolong overall survival time progression .</detailed_description>
