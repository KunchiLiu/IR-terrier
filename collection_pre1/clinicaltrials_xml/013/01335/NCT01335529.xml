	<detailed_description>The majority HIV/HCV co-infected patient non responder 48 week current standard-of-care Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin . The result re-treatment disappointing . The addition Boceprevir current standard-of-care show increase efficacy therapy HCV mono-infected patient previously treat bi-therapy . Knowing HIV/HCV co-infected patient subject rapid hepatic fibrosis well increased risk cirrhosis , end-stage liver disease hepatocellular carcinoma , important improve response rate re-treatment hepatitis C patient . Subjects enrol trial many predictive factor failure : HIV co-infection , previous failure Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin , HCV genotype 1 infection . One study report SVR rate 9 % re-treatment Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin patient . Another trial show substantial increase response rate tri-therapy HCV mono-infected patient . The investigator propose carry multicentric , national , non-randomized phase II trial 80 patient . The proportion patient F4 cirrhosis inferior 50 % enrolled subject . The number null responder previous treatment ( HCV RNA drop &lt; 2 log10 W12 ) without F4 cirrhosis lower equal 20 . The primary objective study estimate , Genotype 1 - HCV/HIV co-infected patient , non responder previous therapy Peg-Interferon/Ribavirin , rate SVR 48 72 week three-drug regimen contain Peg-Interferon , Ribavirin Boceprevir accord Virologic Response compare SVR rate threshold rate 20 % , low rate consider therapeutic benefit population . A pharmacokinetic sub-study include 30 patient performed estimate pharmacokinetic parameter antiretroviral treatment ( Atazanavir combine Ritonavir , Raltegravir , Tenofovir ) combination anti HCV treatment baseline W8 pharmacokinetic parameter Boceprevir W8 .</detailed_description>
