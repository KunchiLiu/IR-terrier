	<detailed_description>Testing All participant initially screen telephone determine eligibility . After satisfy eligibility requirement , ask come preliminary test day . For individual protocol , least 2 study visit require ( preliminary day experimental day ) . The specific technique study underlined present . Participants arrive early testing day , abstain tobacco , vitamin supplementation , exercise least 12 hour prior investigation . Blood draw measurement vascular function perform baseline follow protocol ( Aim 1A &amp; B , 2A &amp; B ) . The P.I. , phlebotomist , research assistant certify draw blood collect total blood sample equal approximately 80ml ( 40ml pre 40ml post ) , 5-6 tablespoon . Prescreening-Phone Screening - A phone screen form use participant wish involve research study . The study explain subject wish continue ask contact information determine exclusion apply . Subjects eligible scheduled initial preliminary day test . Preliminary Testing Day - All subject ask report laboratory follow overnight fast abstained exercise least 12 hour vitamin supplementation least 72 hour prior investigation . Following initial telephone screening , eligible subject sign consent form undergo preliminary day test . The preliminary day utilize assess 1 ) medical health history , 2 ) body composition , 3 ) pulmonary function , 4 ) maximal skeletal muscle function , 5 ) brachial ankle index assessment peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) familiarize subject protocol study . Hematocrit hemoglobin determine finger stick rule anemia . A physical activity questionnaire ( IPAQ ) administer subject quantify physical activity status . Ankle-brachial index perform subject characterize severity peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) . Subject/Medical Information Form - This form summarize information subject 's contact information , personal information , family medical history information , height weight . If concern regard information present medical health history form , subject 's physician medical director may consult . Completion questionnaire take approximately 10 minute . Body Composition - Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DXA ) late technology detect bone mineral density , bone mineral content , lean fat mass . The DXA scan non-invasive &amp; painless procedure perform preliminary testing day . The DXA ( Hologic Discovery W use Hologic Apex Software , 2.3.1 ) use measure bone mineral density body fat composition use low level radiation ( Two scan equivalent three day background radiation expose daily routine ) . Participants ask remove item may contain metal include : jewelry , belt , shoe , ear body piercings , etc . Gowns available need remove clothing . Participants instruct lay pad platform remain still platform stop move . The DXA approve perform numerous protocol ( HAC # : 0901159 , 0711123 , etc. ) . Female participant advise urine pregnancy test do prior DXA test meet inclusion criterion non-pregnant female study . Body Mass Index ( BMI ; kg/m2 ) calculate use height ( ) measure near 0.1 cm weight ( kg ) measure near 0.05 kg . Both height weight take without shoe wear clothes possible . Waist Hip Ratio ( WHR ) measure use inelastic vinyl tape measure ( Creative Health Products , Ann Arbor , MI ) . The site waist horizontal plane , level narrow part torso , 10th rib iliac crest ; subject standing erect , arm side , foot together , relax abdomen . The site hip horizontal plane level maximal extension buttock ; subject standing erect . Three measurement take nearest 0.1 cm site . The average three measurement use calculate WHR . The total duration assessment approximately 45 minute . Pulmonary Function Test ( PFT ) - A routine pulmonary function test conduct subject use spirometry . Each subject instruct perform force expiration maneuver subject ask expire air spirometer forcefully rapidly possible . Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) - This test do measure blood pressure arm near ankle . The ABI use screen peripheral vascular disease use control confound PVD subject . Flow-Mediated Dilation ( FMD ) - Subjects lie supine position 20 minute obtain hemodynamic steady state . A blood pressure cuff ( Hokanson ) place around forearm ( distal Doppler transducer ) rapidly inflate 250 mmHg 5 minute ( circulatory arrest ) . Simultaneous ultrasound image vessel ( B-mode ) Doppler waveform collect 10 second prior 2 minute follow deflation cuff . All B-mode image analyze use automate edge detection software ( Medical Imaging Applications ) , intensity weight velocity spectra segment save GE Logiq 7 hard drive off-line blood velocity waveform analysis . P.I . utilized traditional method brachial artery flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) induce reactive hyperemia ass vascular endothelial function population range young healthy adult old adult pathological conditions47,58,59 . Carotid Artery Health ( IMT ) - Immediately follow FMD assessment , B-mode ultrasonography use right left carotid artery determine thickness intima-media interface . Automated edge detection software ( Medical Imaging Applications ) use analysis . Carotid Artery Compliance ( CAC ) - After 20 minute rest supine position , carotid artery compliance determine non-invasively use high-resolution ultrasonography ( Vivid 7 , General Electric ) simultaneous applanation tonometry ( Millar Instruments , Inc. ) contralateral carotid artery [ 9,10,11 ] . Briefly , carotid artery diameter measure ~2 cm proximal carotid bulb transducer place 90° angle vessel . Images record via frame grabber subsequent off-line analysis maximal diameter ( i.e. , systolic expansion ) minimal diameter ( e.g. , diastolic relaxation ) correspond carotid artery pressure waveforms vascular image analysis software ( Medical Imaging Applications , LLC ) . High-fidelity carotid artery pressure waveform record contralateral carotid artery pen-like applanation tonometer probe record via data acquisition software ( WinDaq , Inc ) . This technique provide waveform harmonic content obtain invasively human . The carotid blood pressure waveform calibrate brachial mean diastolic blood pressure previously describe [ 10 , 11 ] . Dr. Pierce ~3 year experience perform carotid artery ultrasound ~7 year perform applanation tonometry large artery . He responsible perform ultrasound training research assistant perform applanation tonometry . All image waveform analyse perform investigator , blind identity subject . Active Hyperemia Induced Flow-Mediated Dilation ( Skeletal Muscle Function ) - Performing localized exercise eliminate systemic pulmonary limitation allow skeletal muscle function patient COPD compare healthy control . During preliminary day , subject undergo grade maximal plantar flexion exercise test ( low leg ) volitional fatigue . For treatment day , similar grade exercise test perform addition obtain absolute progressive work rate 2 , 4 , 6 watt subject . Each work rate perform approximately 3 minute obtain steady state . Simultaneous B-mode image Doppler waveform assess diameter velocity popliteal artery ( low leg ) , respectively , collect last 45 second work rate . Heart rate oxygen saturation assess throughout exercise . Spygmocor - Pulse Wave Velocity ( PWV ) - A Spygmocor® device use baseline follow protocol assess PWV . PWV analysis provide non-invasive assessment arterial stiffness . Increased arterial stiffness know associated cardiovascular disease [ 13 , 14 , 15 ] . The participant require lie rest position approximately 30-45 minute . The research assistant place ECG electrode sensor carotid , femoral , radial distal artery location . A highly sensitive pen-like device , call tonometer , gently apply record velocity blood flow point . Blood Samples ( pre post protocol ) - A 40 ml sample venous blood drawn pre post protocol P.I . certify technician via sterile technique transfer EDTA SST tubes analysis HDL-cholesterol , total cholesterol , triglyceride , calculate LDL , glucose Cholestech analyzer unit ( Hayward , California ) laboratory bioassay describe . When applicable ( protocols # 3 ) , avoid multiple needle stick venous catheter place subject arm . Following blood draw , every 1-2 hour , approximately 3cc injectable sterile saline flush lock catheter maintain patency ( saline block ) .</detailed_description>
