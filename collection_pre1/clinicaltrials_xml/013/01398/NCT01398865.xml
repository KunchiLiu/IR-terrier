	<detailed_description>The investigator choose focus five region interest , namely ACC , OFC , caudate , amygdala hippocampus . These brain region previously associate obsessive-compulsive , affective , psychotic phenomenon . The investigator test correlation pre-treatment FDG brain image subsequent SSRI treatment outcome identify potential predictor treatment response . Finally , investigator compare pre-treatment post-treatment PET FDG study well MRI study BDD subject examine change brain region follow treatment . The goal propose research use FDG-PET MRI identify predictor treatment response SSRIs BDD determine change rCMRglu BDD subject follow treatment SSRIs .</detailed_description>
