	<detailed_description>This study attempt answer follow question : 1 . What specific need clinical content among various clinical personnel ( nurse , resident , attending ) different service two different hospital ( MGH , BWH ) ? 2 . How IT support sign-out facilitates interdisciplinary communication yet preserve user-specific content among different clinical personnel ? 3 . Can sign-out tool currently deploy MGH transfer BWH use exist IT service minimum amount local IS effort ? 4 . What future need tool fully access data MetaVision deploy ? 5 . How tool improve optimizes user adoption , provider satisfaction workflow , quality sign-out , continuity care ? 6 . Is feasible future , refine version tool adopt across Partners acute care hospital ? The study design observational , before-after pilot study . A multi-disciplinary steering committee work group assemble determine requirement guide design conjunction HPM leadership , research staff , Partners IS analyst , MGH LCS personnel . The intervention implement two service . Before implementation , several outcome measure , include provider satisfaction workflow , continuity care , quality sign-out . Deliverables include follow : 1 . Clinical functional specification new web-based sign-out tool 2 . A prototype sign-out tool test 2 active clinical service , one MGH BWH 3 .
