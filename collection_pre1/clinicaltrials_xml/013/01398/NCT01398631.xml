	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational study patient admit emergency room chest pain . All patient check resident charge immediately admission , lab value know , mean admission Case Report Form ( CRF ) , consist classical element patient history , risk factor , medication physical examination . This CRF fill immediately resident . No additional effort ask patient . Patient data follow least 6 week gather hospital chart . The predictive value three score system : HEART ( History , ECG , Age , Risk factor , Troponin ) , TIMI ( Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ) GRACE ( Global Registry Acute Coronary Events ) discharge diagnosis occurrence Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events ( MACE ) calculate . The primary hypothesis study HEART score significantly well predictor TIMI and/or GRACE score cardiovascular event six week period follow admission emergency room .</detailed_description>
