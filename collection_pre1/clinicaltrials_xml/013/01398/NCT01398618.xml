	<brief_title>Comparing Two Preventive Regimens Latent Tuberculosis Infection ( LTBI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In country low incidence tuberculosis ( TB ) , new , active case occur among person infect , contain infection , later develop active TB . Therefore , identify person latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) follow preventive therapy important strategy public health TB elimination . Until decade , diagnosis LTBI base contact investigation tuberculin skin testing ( TST ) . However , false-positive result uncommon due cross-reactivity bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin ( BCG ) vaccine species non-tuberculosis mycobacteria ( NTM ) , false-negative result occur least 20 % immunocompromised host . With application M. tuberculosis-specific antigen , current interferon-gamma release assay ( IGRAs ) show well sensitivity specificity TST detect host response M. tuberculosis . Therefore , current guideline diagnosis management latent tuberculosis infection recommend use IGRA replace TST . Reports recent study compare sensitivity , specificity availability , well cost-effective analysis test inconclusive . The best way varies different area , culture facility . Therefore , collect local data would helpful policy make public health . Several regimen use treat LTBI , include 9-month isoniazid , 4-month rifampin , 2-month rifampin plus pyrazinamide , 3-month isoniazid plus rifampin . Among 4 regimen , 2-month rifampin plus pyrazinamide report associate unacceptable hepatotoxicity even mortality due hepatic failure . Therefore , regimen abandon treat LTBI . The treatment completion rate , adverse event , reduction risk develop active TB similar 3-month isoniazid plus rifampin 6-month Isoniazid . At present , 9-month isoniazid still popular regimen LTBI , toxicity low , drug interaction seldom , isoniazid use many year . However , long treatment duration seriously compromise completion rate . By contrast , rifampin safe , cheap acceptable . Recent study , include cost-effective analysis , favor use 4-month rifampin treat LTBI . However , outcome study completion rate preventive therapy , rather event develop active TB . In addition , use statistic modeling rather conduct clinical trial . Though still endemic area , incidence TB Taiwan decrease recent year . Further reduction TB incidence , even elimination rely treatment LTBI . However , cost-effective screen method cost-effective regimen Taiwan still unclear . Therefore , investigator design prospective study follow adult household contact LTBI 2 year compare efficacy 9-month isoniazid 4-month rifampicin ) .</detailed_description>
