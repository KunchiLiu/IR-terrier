	<brief_summary>Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) become dominant strategy treatment ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) , study show PPCI superior fibrinolytic therapy . Recent evidence suggest transradial access ( TRA ) superior transfemoral ( TFA ) patient undergo PPCI . Two large trial report mortality benefit favour TRA . The result two trial could significantly impact practice guideline lead recommendation approach choice primary PCI radial rather femoral . This would significant implication PCI center interventionalists associate large impact practice education . Yet , many center interventionalists Canada USA prefer TFA currently feel pressured make change TRA . With say , trial include new pharmacotherapy new technology would likely close eliminate gap TFA TRA improve safety efficacy two approach . Furthermore , trial power conclusively show mortality benefit . The author two large trial emphasize need trial confirm benefit TRA . The SAFARI-STEMI trial aim compare TFA TRA patient undergo primary percutaneous intervention ( PPCI ) . The primary outcome define cause mortality measure 30 day . The trial also evaluate : 1 ) bleed event 2 ) composite death , reinfarction , stroke defined major adverse clinical event ( MACE ) . The trial include use antithrombotic therapy monotherapy , either bivalirudin unfractionated heparin ; use glycoprotein inhibitor IIb/IIIa inhibitor avoid . The study encourage liberal use vascular closing device . The trial also compare delay reperfusion two strategy . Finally , cost analysis propose . In view recent publication , need large randomize trial use contemporary adjunct therapy assess safety efficacy TRA vs. TFA PPCI . The propose trial aim conclusively show whether survival benefit associate TRA approach .</brief_summary>
