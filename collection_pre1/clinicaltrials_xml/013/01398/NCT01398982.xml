	<brief_summary>Breast reconstruction use patient 's abdominal tissue one common method restore mastectomy defect breast cancer patient . Despite increase popularity safety , abdomen remain major source postoperative pain . Adequate pain control important show reduce medical complication , in-hospital death , shorten hospital stay , lessen chronic pain disability , turn low health-care cost . The current postoperative pain relief protocol consist primarily patient-controlled anesthesia device deliver intravenous opioids . Opioids cause numerous side-effects sedation , headache , nausea , vomit , breathe difficulty , bladder bowel dysfunction . A promising approach provide postoperative pain control abdominal incision newly develop transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) peripheral nerve block . Although TAP block find effective pain-relief follow major abdominal surgery , use never study breast reconstruction use abdominal tissue . Therefore , investigator propose rigorously study efficacy TAP block reduce postoperative abdominal pain follow abdominal tissue breast reconstruction . This study significant implication improve clinical care health outcome patient undergoing common method breast reconstruction technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Statement Objectives/Specific Aims The transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block newly develop block involve T6-L1 nerve supply anterior abdominal wall . Its effectiveness report follow major abdominal surgery , follow abdominally-based autologous tissue breast reconstruction . Thus , propose randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial evaluate efficacy TAP block improve pain symptomatology follow abdominally-based , autologous tissue breast reconstruction . The primary objective study compare mean total opioid consumption first postoperative 48 hour control study group intravenous morphine equivalent unit . By directly block neural afferent , mean opioid consumption significantly low group receive intermittent local anaesthetic bolus compare placebo group TAP catheter . The secondary outcome interest compare follow parameter : A . Continuous outcome . Total in-hospital cumulative opioid consumption ii . Total in-hospital cumulative anti-nausea consumption iii . Quality Recovery ( QOR ) score ( 0-18 ) iv . Duration hospital stay B . Repeated measure outcome In Hospital postoperative measure : . Daily pain intensity score rest movement use visual pain analogue scale ( 0-10 ) ii . Postoperative nausea vomiting ( score 0-3 ) iii . Sedation score Long-term chronic pain , anxiety , function , quality life ( QOL ) measure : iv . Pain disability index v. Short-form McGill Pain Questionnaire vi . Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale vii . Short-form 36 C. Time event outcomes . Time first bowel movement ii . Time ambulation Hypothesis : Compared control group , TAP block group statistically significant reduction total in-hospital consumption opioids , pain score side-effects opioid use sedation , nausea , vomit . This also result great QOR score TAP block group . Surgical milestone time ambulation , first bowel movement , duration hospital stay also reduce TAP block group . In addition , hypothesize less acute postoperative pain achieve use TAP block result reduction chronic pain disability , anxiety depression , improve QOL long-term .</detailed_description>
