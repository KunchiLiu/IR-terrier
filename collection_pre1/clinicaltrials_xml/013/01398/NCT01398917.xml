	<brief_summary>Primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) chronic inflammatory disease biliary tract unknown origin . Around 50 % patient develop disease course narrow main bile duct correspond increase symptom itch , jaundice abdominal pain . These narrowing treat balloon dilatation temporary insertion plastic endoprosthesis . However , know two therapeutic modality best . This study aim compare technique order determine best term postpone recurrence narrowing , safety cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short-term Stenting Versus Balloon Dilatation Dominant Strictures Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Primary sclerosing cholangitis chronic progressive fibro-obliterative disease biliary tree lead biliary cirrhosis . During course , dominant stricture occur approximately 50 % patient . These accompany lead worsen symptoms jaundice indication endoscopic treatment . The best form treatment , either balloon dilatation short-term stent placement , never formally investigate . Objective : Primary : To compare efficacy single session balloon dilatation versus short-term stent placement non-advanced PSC patient regard re-intervention free recurrence rate two year . Secondary : To compare short term efficacy single balloon dilatation versus short-term stenting regard improvement cholestatic symptom , biochemical cholestasis , quality life non-endstage PSC patient three month ; compare safety single balloon dilatation session versus short-term stenting non advance PSC patient two year . Study design : This multicenter , open-label , randomize intervention study . Study population : Non-advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis subject progression cholestatic complaint outpatient population seven participate centre . Main study parameters/endpoints : 1 . Difference re-intervention free survival time group two year . 2 . Change semi-quantitative score cholestatic symptom ( pruritus , right upper quadrant pain , fatigue ) baseline three month . 3 . Change total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase , yGT baseline 3 month . 4 . Safety : adverse event , clinical laboratory value , vital sign . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Currently , intervention belong standard patient care armamentarium . Burden patient exist slightly regular follow-up visit two year ( three-monthly instead every 3-4 month ) treat centre . ERCP associate low mortality ( &lt; 0.5 % ) acceptable morbidity ( overall 5 % ) . Most dreaded complication severe post-ERCP pancreatitis ( &lt; 2 % ) suppurative cholangitis ( &lt; 2 % ) . From available retrospective literature data incidence complication seem differ two treatment modality . ERCP perform clearcut clinical indication anyway .</detailed_description>
