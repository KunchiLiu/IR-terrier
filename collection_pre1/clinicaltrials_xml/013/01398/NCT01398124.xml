	<brief_summary>Despite recent advance treatment patient resect NSCLC , disease recurrence mortality relate lung cancer common among patient early stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Therefore novel approach necessary improve outcome early stage NSCLC . The preclinical study conduct vaccine base approach provide rationale evaluate adjunct surgery patient early stage NSCLC . Administration vaccine surgery also allow evaluation tumor specimen immunological response vaccine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyclin B1 Peptide-Pulsed Autologous Dendritic Cell Vaccine Resectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In currently propose study , patient receive first dose vaccine approximately 2 week prior surgery . The second dose administer 3-4 week follow surgery . A booster dose vaccine give 6 month 2nd vaccine . The tumor tissue serum study immunological response follow therapy vaccine . Patients allow receive adjuvant chemotherapy indicate . The choice chemotherapy regimen discretion treat physician , preferably 3-4 cycle platinum combination regimen . The vaccine administer least 2 week chemotherapy initiate .</detailed_description>
