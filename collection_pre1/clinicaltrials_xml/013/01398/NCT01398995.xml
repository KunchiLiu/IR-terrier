	<brief_summary>People Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) like take part sport exercise , problem metabolism blood glucose control make difficult . Some people T1DM administer insulin via insulin pump , also know continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion ( CSII ) therapy , background basal level insulin constantly infuse skin special pump , bolus dose insulin give accompany food . Clinical experience suggest may particularly useful manage diabetes exercise , limited experimental evidence support . The aim research , divide three part , investigate hypothesis physiological response sub-maximal ( moderate ) exercise person type 1 diabetes treat CSII , make approximate closely physiological response healthy individual prior reduction basal insulin infusion rate . Evidence child demonstrate reduce basal insulin infusion rate 50 % normal beginning exercise reduce rate low blood glucose ( hypoglycaemia ) exercise . However , reduce insulin infusion rate immediate effect level insulin body , evidence adult suggest level insulin bloodstream start exercise important factor whether hypoglycaemia develop exercise . This suggest reduce basal insulin infusion rate time exercise may useful . The aim study compare effect basal insulin reduction blood glucose level visit reduction make start exercise , 30 minute , 60 minute 90 minute . The null hypothesis test difference condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Managing Insulin Pumps Exercise ( Study 2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants recruit type 1 diabetes treat CSII . Each participant require attend 5 separate occasion . The first visit take place time day . At first visit formal , write consent obtain participation trial . Following assessment make VO2 MAX ( maximal oxygen uptake exercise ) use Balke-Ware treadmill protocol . Once finish first visit complete . The 4 visit take place 2 hour follow lunch contain 60 grams carbohydrate . Advice give achieve . On arrival cannula insert dorsum hand blood sample take . The hand arm allow take arterialised blood sample . Further blood sample take 30 , 60 90 minute exercise commence . Participants ask reduce basal insulin infusion rate 50 % usual either immediately cannula insert 30 minute later ( 1 hour prior exercise ) , 60 minute later ( 30 minute prior exercise ) 90 minute later ( start exercise ) . These four condition present participant randomise order . Participants exercise 60 minute 50 % VO2 MAX electronically brake cycle ergometer . At end exercise set blood sample take . Participants rest 30 minute final set blood sample take . After cannula remove study visit complete . A snack offer . In event hypoglycaemia identify point care test blood sample take laboratory confirmation . Participants give 15 gram carbohydrate permit continue exercise unless feel exercise become significantly difficult , feel unwell investigator concern . Participants give 15 gram rapid act carbohydrate , repeat every 10-15 minute blood glucose level rise 4mmol/l .</detailed_description>
