	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) cause considerable death , exacerbation ( flare symptom ) major cause hospital admission UK . Bacterial infection play important role development COPD , however , little information available use long term antibiotic treatment disease . Therefore purpose study identify best antibiotic regime treat patient COPD persistent bacterial infection lung . We test variety approach include old new regime prescribe either daily basis lower dose `` pulse '' course ( example , every day five day every month ) . The three antibiotic test study : moxifloxacin , azithromycin doxycycline . This 13 week study conduct Royal Free Hospital , London . It expect approximately 200 patient select study . The information get study may help u treat future patient COPD well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Optimal Antibiotic Regime Long-term Therapy Stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 14 week study 200 patient COPD select study GP practice 15 mile radius Royal Free Hospital participate study . The 3 antibiotic regime ( plus placebo group ) use study : Moxifloxacin : oral dose 400 mg daily 5 consecutive day every 4 week . Azithromycin : oral dose 250 mg daily three time week ( every day ) . Doxycycline : oral dose 100 mg daily . Placebo give one table daily . Study recruitment enrollment take place Primary Care Research Network ( PCRN ) . Potentially eligible participant age ≥ 45 identified GP practice 15 mile radius RFH . Potential eligible patient contact letter accompany patient information sheet ( PIS ) describe study detail invite patient attend hospital visit enroll . If patient respond invitation letter , follow reminder letter approximately 2 week later . Non responder reminder letter follow final telephone call . Patients express interest participation offer screening appointment Royal Free Hospital . Patients ask visit hospital 3 time contacted twice telephone course study . At Screening Visit ( V1 ) , follow take place : - The study discuss patient visit he/she agree participate , ask sign consent form . - A medical history patient take . This include smoke history , antibiotic Hypersensitivity , well patient concomitant medication . - A full physical examination perform height weight patient record . - A lung function test ( spirometry assessment ) perform . - A blood sample collect order perform routine haematology/blood chemistry liver function . - A sputum sample take analysed determine number bacteria lung screen Tuberculosis . - A urine pregnancy test carry female childbearing potential . - Patients ask complete two set questionnaires; `` St. George 's respiratory questionnaire '' ( SGRQ ) include simple question patient COPD condition affect life; second EQ5D questionnaire include simple question relate general quality life . - Patients give daily diary card ask record symptom . - An ECG perform patient . If patient eligible trial , randomise one follow group : Moxifloxacin : oral dose 400 mg daily 5 consecutive day every 4 week total duration 13 week . Azithromycin : oral dose 250 mg daily three time week ( every day ) total duration 13 week . Doxycycline : oral dose 100 mg daily , total duration 13 week Placebo : oral daily dose one capsule , total duration 13 week . This single-blind trial . Patients blind treatment ; investigator unblinded . Microbiologists also blind treatment allocation assess sputum sample . Following randomisation eligible patient , patient ask return hospital second visit ( within 1 week ) collect medication research fellow instruct patient start take medication within 3 day . At visit , research team check patient happy fill diary card happy answer question may . In week 5 week 9 treatment , patient contact telephone : - Monitor progress compliance . - Remind patient take medication . - Encourage patient contact GP/investigator symptom worsen . - The occurrence adverse effects/serious adverse effect ( AE/SAE ) exacerbation check record . - Remind patient fill daily diary card End Study Visit ( week 14 ) : Patients ask return hospital follow assessment make : - The occurrence AE/SAE exacerbation check record . - A spirometry assessment test lung function . - Diary card collect investigator . - SGRQ EQ5D questionnaire complete visit patient . - A sputum sample take patient determine bacterial number lung . - Unused study medication packaging collect patient .</detailed_description>
