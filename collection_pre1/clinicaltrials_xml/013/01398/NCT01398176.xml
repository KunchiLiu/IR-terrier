	<brief_title>Immune Benefits From Mushroom Consumption</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A non-therapeutic study describe . This intervention study two level mushroom intake . The number subject experimental assay select pilot study generate dose level efficacy . Subjects age 21 50 recruit provide baseline blood draw . The mushroom supplementation occur 4 week two level 85 g ( 3 ounce ) 170 g ( 6 ounce ) . Immunity change fairly rapidly ; early study investigator saw change little 3 day . Blood take 4 week . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell isolate blood use freshly isolate , culture autologous serum 24 hour 10 day . Freshly isolated cell use count γδ T cell NK cell baseline value . After 24 hour stimulation broad base mitogen , culture medium harvest assayed cytokine secrete culture medium well NK cell activation proliferation . Finally , cell harvest 10 day assay γδ T cell activation proliferation . Consumers benefit know health benefit derive mushroom . Potentially , stimulate mushroom sale increase variety mushroom consume . γδ T cell reside epithelial lining lung , gut reproductive tract although number precisely know , much great number circulate αβ T cell . γδ T cell activate way αβ cell , activate like cell innate immune system , recognition pathogen-associated molecular pattern ( 1,2 ) . Recognition pathogen-associated molecular pattern rather non-specific , effective . For example , prenyl phosphate molecule pattern recognize receptor γδ T cell . Interaction prenyl phosphate γδ T cell receptor result γδ T cell proliferation ; expression cell surface activation marker , cytokine receptor ; lastly , synthesis secretion cytokine necessary communicate branch immune system . The investigator hypothesize consume mushroom result great proliferation stimulate also enhance capacity activation , define cytokine secretion cell surface marker expression . A second quality γδ T cell ability turn immune response longer need . Carding Egan ( 3,4 ) show γδ T cell responsible kill activated macrophage pathogen eliminate . Knockout mouse model show elimination γδ cell promote chronic inflammation , prevent wound healing ( 5 ) may increase risk cancer ( 6,7 ) . The magnitude importance γδ T cell realize . By strengthen γδ T cell , investigator fight pathogen well resolve inflammation quicker . It hypothesis certain bioactive component resemble pathogen-associated molecular pattern interact weakly epithelial γδ T cell way `` primed '' , activate . The bioactive food component interact cell enough strength cause actual response , , later , cell encounter pathogen , react quick intensity already prim . The primary bioactive component mushroom may interact immune cell polysaccharide glycoprotein two major type mushroom polysaccharide include glucans ( β α ) heteroglycans . Additionally , mushroom contain another important polysaccharide , chitin . Chitin compose N-acetyl-d-glucosamine unit ( 8,9 ) . These compound likely candidate , addition immuno-modulating compound Vitamin D ( 10 ) B vitamin . Mushrooms show impact immune cell , particularly NK cell ( 11,12 ) γδ T cell study . The composition mushroom well suit interact γδ T cell . NK cell activity use study positive control although investigator use flow cytometry rather generalize non-specific cytolytic activity . The investigator know previous study human ( 7,13,14 ) publish study ( 15,16 ) food tea , apple , encapsulate fruit vegetable contain compound appear prime γδ T cell . The investigator hypothesize bioactive compound gut recognize intestinal γδ T cell , result prim cell . These cell static migrate tissue , circulation well lymph node ( 17 ) . Thus , investigator measure functional change blood borne γδ T cell regardless whether bioactive compound absorb . This study specifically study shiitake ( Lentinus edodes ) mushroom . This mushroom show research variety health benefit , feed trial , none healthy human , do ( 18-20 ) . 5 . Specific Aims : The aim determine bioactive compound mushroom enhance activity cell type . Because cell type reside epithelial lining migrates via blood lymph system , investigator measure functional change cell regardless whether bioactive compound absorb . It often describe first line defense .</detailed_description>
