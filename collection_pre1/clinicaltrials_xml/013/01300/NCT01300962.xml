	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objectives - To determine safety , DLT , MTD BKM120 administer concomitantly capecitabine patient metastatic breast cancer ( ARM A ) - To determine safety , DLT , MTD BYL719 administer concomitantly capecitabine patient metastatic breast cancer ( ARM B ) - To determine safety , DLT , MTD BKM120 administer concomitantly capecitabine trastuzumab patient metastatic breast cancer ( ARM C ) - To determine safety , DLT , MTD BKM120 administer concomitantly capecitabine lapatinib patient metastatic breast cancer ( ARM D ) Secondary Objectives - To characterize safety tolerability BKM120 combination capecitabine include acute chronic toxicity - To characterize safety tolerability ofBYL719 combination capecitabine include acute chronic toxicity - To characterize safety tolerability BKM120 combination capecitabine trastuzumab , include acute chronic toxicity - To characterize safety tolerability BKM120 combination capecitabine lapatinib , include acute chronic toxicity Exploratory Objectives - To obtain primary , archive paraffin-embedded tissue evaluate intrinsic breast cancer subtype ( i.e. , HER2 , luminal B , etc . ) important predictive biomarkers ( PI3K activate mutation , pAKT , p-mTOR ) , explore correlation therapeutic response BKM120 BYL719 combination capecitabine , without addition lapatinib trastuzumab - To evaluate PK profile BKM120 concomitant capecitabine - To examine signal pathway signatures - To examine drug effect pre- post-treatment core biopsy specimen ( optional ) appropriate patient - To explore patient motivator enrol early phase study patient interview Outline : This study four-arm multi-center , open-label phase I clinical trial test hypothesis addition BKM120 capecitabine ( ARM A ) ; addition BYL719 capecitabine ( ARM B ) ; addition BKM120 capecitabine plus trastuzumab ( ARM C ) ; addition BKM120 capecitabine plus lapatinib ( ARM D ) safe tolerable evidence DLT see . Following screen informed consent , treatment initiate one following : ARM A : BKM120 PO daily 21 day ( 3 week ) plus capecitabine PO BID 2 week ( capecitabine administer third week ) . ARM B : BYL719 PO BID 21 day ( 3 week ) plus capecitabine PO BID 2 week ( capecitabine administer third week cycle ) ARM C : BKM120 PO daily 21 day ( 3 week ) plus capecitabine PO BID 2 week ( capecitabine administer third week ) plus trastuzumab intravenous infusion Day 1 ARM D : BKM120 PO daily 21 day ( 3 week ) plus capecitabine PO BID 2 week ( capecitabine administer third week ) plus lapatinib PO daily 21 day . The consent separate document patient study team know ahead time Arm open enrol therefore focus discussion patient ARM . Cycles arm repeat every 3 week ( 21 day ) . Patients continue protocol-based therapy progression , unacceptable toxicity , study withdrawal , patient death .</detailed_description>
