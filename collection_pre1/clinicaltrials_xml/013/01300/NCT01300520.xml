	<brief_summary>The current method incision localization many surgical procedure require doctor reference medical image , X-ray , judge body incision make . However , precise information scan show patient 's skin . Surgeons commonly use palpation locate point incision . They may feel area directly find landmarks skin estimate location . The following factor complicate palpation : overweight patient , foreign body difficult feel skin , fracture little displacement , location dense muscle . These difficulty compound new surgeon , since palpation skill derive experience . In many circumstance surgeon need know insert tool place incision - necessarily need know depth area interest . If palpation prove ineffective , may force use fluoroscopy . By reference fluoroscopy image surgeon move radiopaque marker , surgical tool , close area interest . Fluoroscopy time-consuming , expose medical personnel patient radiation . Many fluoroscopic image may require single procedure . By identify efficacy new medical device , `` Target Tape '' , potential outcome make small incision , fast localization , reduction fluoroscopy use reduce chance surgical error associate cost . Target Tape non invasive device grid ruler format place subject 's skin . The grid/ruler pattern appear medical imaging scan . Standard surgical skin ink use place marking define pattern skin . This pattern mimic Target Tape grid ruler pattern . The medical practitioner correlate skin marking medical scan image make incision accurate location .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Consent must first obtain prospective patient Target Tape incorporated procedure . When target procedure schedule occur , surgeon first determine Target Tape would appropriate use . The procedure need able integrate Target Tape use Method Use describe . The decision pursue procedure discretion medical practitioner consent patient . Depending procedure , medical practitioner may need communicate OR radiology department integrate Target Tape protocol , since practitioner make incision ( ) may always one applying . Examples procedure may utilize Target Tape may stabilization fracture , interlock screw insertion tibia femur nailings , breast biopsy , foreign body removal , thoracic spinal surgery . Once procedure determine appropriate accommodate Target Tape , medical practitioner approach prospective patient explain device utilize , benefit potential risk associate , answer question patient may . A representative Aeos Biomedical may hand aid process may also observe say procedure record necessary information . The consent form sign Target Tape utilized procedure . The methodology create outcome measure occur 2 stage multiple step stage : Stage I : Proof Concept 1 . Specify measurement goal 2 . Proof Concept Testing 3 . Item generation 4 . Item reduction Stage 2 : Verification 5 . Verification Testing 6 . Reliability 7 . Validity 8 . Interpretability ( ) Subjects ( ii ) Involved Groups ( iii ) Data Collection ( iv ) Statistics 6 ) Statistical Analysis Sample size Stage 1 : 3 Orthopaedic surgeon , 10 patient , per procedure type 3 Spinal surgeon 10 patient , per procedure type 3 Plastic surgeon 10 patient , per procedure type 2 Thoracic surgeon 5 patient , per procedure type 2 Radiologists 10 patient , per procedure type The number medical practitioner type procedure may fluctuate . Furthermore , definitive list specialty . It foreseeable great variety procedure specialty may include proof concept test . Moreover , number patient may vary depend relative magnitude observation feedback medical practitioner . Stage 2 : The sample size segment stage correspond sample size use create outcome measure different population . After Stage 1 complete , sample sizes Stage 2 assess statistical model create time . A preliminary estimate would require 5 time sample size per procedure within Stage 1 sufficient . Variable generation - There statistical analysis step . It anticipate 10 procedure would use device least two different doctor . Variable reduction - The list item generate step administer doctor ask rate item accord importance . Any item deem insignificant remove list . Verification Testing It anticipate 5 time sample size procedure occur step . Subject test result Stage 1 , set significant performance variable determine respective target procedure . Target Tape would randomly utilized procedure , control perform procedure patient characteristic . Observation significant performance variable occurs procedure</detailed_description>
