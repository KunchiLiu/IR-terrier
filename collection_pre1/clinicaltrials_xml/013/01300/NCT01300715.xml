	<brief_title>An Alternative Technique Lumbar Medial Branch Radiofrequency : Comparison With Empirical Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The zygapophysial ( facet ) joint pain challenge condition pain specialist since 20th century . According previous report , degenerative change facet joint account 10 % - 15 % case chronic low back pain . However , major source frustration definitive standard document clinical diagnosis validate treatment lumbar facet joint pain . Although subject debate best select patient , radiofrequency ( RF ) neurotomy frequently perform procedure patient lumbar facet generate pain . Lumbar medial branch radiofrequency ( MBRF ) assume effective safe treatment lumbar facet joint pain 1.0 % rate minor complication per lesion site . The rationale efficacy lumbar MBRF would depend use meticulous radiofrequency ( RF ) needle placement stringent patient selection . In spite variable technique lumbar MBRF exists , tunnel vision technique widely recommend exact RF needle placement . However , method us concept steep caudocephalad axial tilt fluoroscopy beam , result unusual appearance vertebral structure long distance skin target site . In institution , therefore , investigator use modify method easy safe place RF needle parallel lumbar medial branch oblique fluoroscopic view . Accordingly , objective evaluate modify technique lumbar MBRF , compare tunnel vision technique , additionally assess complication respect two technique .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Chronic low back pain patient ( pain duration &gt; 6 month ) respond previous treatment , underwent screen medial branch block ( MBBs ) use 0.5 % levobupivacaine hydrochloride ( ChirocaineÂ® , Abbott Korea Ltd , Seoul , Republic Korea ) 0.5 mL standard target points.8 Patients achieve least 80 % pain relief screen MBBs underwent control comparative local anesthetic block use 1 % lidocaine ( 0.5 mL ) 0.5 % levobupivacaine ( 0.5 mL ) . Those achieve great 80 % pain relief follow double block eligible lumbar MBRF , prolong response screen dualcontrolled comparative MBBs consider eligible . 1 . Duration low back pain &lt; 6 mo 2 .
