	<brief_summary>The overall objective investigator research test clinical efficacy TissueLinkâ„¢ ( Salient Surgical Technologies , Inc. ) coagulation system minimize hemoglobin loss intraoperatively . This prospective , randomized investigation perform Duke University Medical Center ( DUMC ) . The overall goal study evaluate efficacy Tissue Link HemoSealing system minimize hemoglobin loss preoperatively , intraoperatively postoperatively patient undergo multilevel elective spinal surgery . Not great eighty patient schedule elective , multi-level decompression fusion spinal surgery Dr. William Richardson randomize two group . Unipolar electrocautery use intraoperative coagulation one group Tissuelink device plus Unipolar electrocautery . These frequently perform case significant blood loss otherwise low morbidity/mortality would benefit effective intraoperative coagulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Very little research exist use TissueLink HemoSealing device spinal surgery . One retrospective study Snyder et al evaluate hemostatic efficacy technology child undergo surgery spinal fusion instrumentation . Although study report statistically significant difference transfusion rate , reduction amount blood transfuse operative time attribute hemostatic efficacy comparison conventional wound management surgery . The surgeon also report clear operative field , improve visualization surgery . Finally , reduction operative time suggest might due use new device may reduce complication diminish overall anesthesia exposure blood product transfusion . From initial retrospective study , author conclude use TissueLink HemoSealing device spine surgery may effective tool control intra- post-operative blood loss may significantly reduce blood relate operative complication . More rigorous research need do evaluate efficacy TissueLink HemoSealing device hemostasis area spine surgery .</detailed_description>
