	<brief_title>Autologous Adipose Tissue Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells Transplantation Patient With Degenerative Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>degenerative arthritis common type arthritis . It estimate 26.9 million Americans 25 year old old clinical degenerative arthritis joint , high percentage affliction old population . Its clinical manifestation include joint pain impairment movement , surround tissue often affect local inflammation . The etiology degenerative arthritis completely understand ; however , injury , age , genetics consider among risk factor . Degenerative arthritis progressively debilitate disease affect mostly cartilage , associate change bone . Cartilage limit intrinsic heal regenerative capacity . Due increase incidence degenerative arthritis age population couple inefficient therapeutic choice , novel cartilage repair strategy need . The availability large quantity MSCs potential ready chondrogenic differentiation prolong vitro expansion make MSCs hopeful candidate progenitor cell source cartilage tissue engineering . In clinical study , mesenchymal stem cell isolate adipose tissue culture , administer cartilage tissue lesion orthopedic surgery . It stimulate regeneration defective cartilage tissue improve function .</detailed_description>
