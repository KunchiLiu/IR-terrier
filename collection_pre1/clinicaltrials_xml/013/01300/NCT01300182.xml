	<brief_title>The Effect Early WBVT Neuromuscular Control After ACLR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The knee joint position sense , postural control , muscular strength functional ability anterior cruciate ligament construction ( ACLR ) distort , even period rehabilitation . Previous study demonstrate improvement knee joint , postural balance , muscle strength functional outcome elderly , stroke spastic patient already . It also conclude balance elderly , postmenopausal woman , Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis , stroke spastic patient significantly improve . Some study show proprioception osteoarthritis patient significantly improve . Knee strength also one aspect improve . However , study focus early effect WBVT knee joint proprioception , postural control , muscle strength , knee joint stability functional ability ACLR case . This study answer research gap .</detailed_description>
