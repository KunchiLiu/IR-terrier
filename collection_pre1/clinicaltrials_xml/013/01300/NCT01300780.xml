	<detailed_description>Study design This randomize , triple-blind , placebo- control , parallel-group clinical trial , equal allocation rate receive either one two treatment . The study take place clinic Brazilian Association Dentistry Guarapuava , Paraná August 2010 December 2010 . Inclusion exclusion criterion Patients include clinical trial least 18 year old good general oral health . Participants recruit mean radio TV advertisement . A total 247 participant examine dental chair check whether met inclusion exclusion criterion . The participant require six caries-free maxillary anterior teeth , without resto- ration labial surface . The central incisor shade C2 darker judge comparison value- orient shade guide ( Vita Lumin , Vita Zahnfabrik , Bad Säckingen , Germany ) . Participants undergone tooth-whitening procedure , present anterior restoration , pregnant/lactating , severe internal tooth discoloration ( tetracycline stain , fluorosis , pulpless teeth ) , take type medicine , bruxism habit , pathology could cause sensitivity ( recession dentin exposure ) exclude study , since would immediately eligible cosmetic treatment , bleach . Participants report earlier present health problem stomach , heart , kidney liver , participant continuously use anti-inflammatory antioxidant action exclude study . Sample size calculation The primary outcome study absolute risk TS . The absolute risk TS report approximately 86 % [ 3 ] bleach product Whiteness HP Maxx ( FGM , Joinville , SC , Brazil ) . Thus , 30 patient require 80 % chance detecting , significant two-sided 5 % level , de- crease primary outcome measure 86 % control group 41 % experimental group . Study intervention Participants randomly stratify sex placebo etoricoxib group . The randomization process perform computer-generated table third person involve research protocol . Details allocate group record card contain sequentially number , opaque , seal envelope . These prepared third person involved phase clinical trial . Once participant eligible procedure , complete baseline assessment , allocation assignment reveal envelope open mentioned third person . Neither participant operator know group allocation , blind protocol . The participant placebo group receive placebo ( Talco pharma SM-200-Henrifarma produtos químicos e farmacêuticos LTDA , São Paulo , SP , Brazil ) participant etoricoxib group receive dose selective COX- 2 inhibitor etoricoxib 60 mg ( Arcoxia , MSD , Campinas , SP , Brazil ) . All participant watch ensure take drug placebo 1 h treatment . The drug similar appearance . A second dose placebo etoricoxib ( 60 mg ) administer 24 h first dose . At time participant require take second dose medicine , research auxiliary call him/her ask him/her take medicine . This procedure implement increase adherence protocol . The gingival tissue teeth bleach isolated use light-polymerized resin dam ( Top Dam , FGM , Joinville , SC , Brazil ) . The 35 % hydrogen peroxide gel ( Whiteness HP Maxx , FGM ) use three 15-min application group accordance manufacturer 's direction . The in-office bleaching agent refresh every 15 min 45-min application period . Two bleaching session 1 week interval perform . All participant instruct brush teeth regularly use fluoridate toothpaste ( Sorriso Fresh , Colgate- Palmolive , São Paulo , SP , Brazil ) . Shade evaluation Shade evaluation record 30 day bleach treatment use two method : subjective evaluation use shade guide ( Vita Lumin , Vita Zahnfabrik , Bad Säckingen , Germany ) objective evaluation use spectrophotometer ( Easyshade , Vident , Brea , CA ) . For subjective examination , 16 shade guide tab arrange high ( B1 ) low ( C4 ) value , color C2 set No . 7 . Although scale linear true sense , change treat though represent continuous approximately linear rank purpose analysis [ 5 , 6 , 11 ] . The measurement area interest shade match middle one third facial surface anterior central incisor [ 11 ] . For calibration purpose , five patient include sample use pilot study , participate training phase study . The two examiner , blind allocation assignment , schedule patient bleach evaluated teeth shade guide baseline 30 day procedure . The two examiner require agreement least 85 % ( Kappa statistic ) begin study evaluation . For objective evaluation , preliminary impression maxillary arch make use dense silicone Adsil ( Vigodent S/A Indústria e Comércio , Rio de Janeiro , RJ , Brazil ) . The impression extend maxillary ca- nine serve standard color measurement guide spectrophotometer . A window create labial surface mold silicone guide central incisor evaluate . The window make use metal device well-formed border , radius 3 mm [ 11 ] . Only one operator take measurement 30 patient , use Vita Easyshade ( Easyshade , Vident , Brea , CA ) 30 day bleach therapy . The shade determine use parameter Easyshade device follow value indicate : L* , ( a* ) , ( b* ) , L* represent value 0 ( black ) 100 ( white ) a* b* represent shade , a* measurement along red-green axis b* measurement along yellow-blue axis . The color comparison treatment give difference two color ( ΔE ) , calculate use formula : ΔE= ( ( ΔL* ) 2+ ( Δa* ) 2+ ( Δb* ) 2 ) 1/2 [ 11 ] . TS evaluation The patient record perception TS first second bleaching session use three pain scale . A 5-point verbal rating scale ( 0 = none , 1 = mild , 2 = moderate , 3 = considerable , 4 = severe ] [ 3 , 5 ] , 0 100 numerical rating scale [ 27 ] visual analogue scale [ 25-29 ] use 10-cm horizontal line word `` pain '' one end `` bad pain '' opposite end use study . Subjects ask record whether experienced TS treatment 1 h , 1 24 h 24 48 h bleaching . The bad scores/numerical value obtain bleach session consider statistical purpose . The value arrange two category : percentage patient report TS least treatment ( absolute risk TS ) overall TS intensity . Statistical analysis The analysis perform intention-to-treat protocol involve participant randomly assign [ 26 ] . The statistician blind study group . The agreement examiner ' objective evaluation evaluate use kappa statistic . The primary outcome absolute risk TS compare use Fisher 's exact test 5 % level significance . The relative risk well confidence interval effect size calculate . TS intensity ( secondary outcome ) also statistical- ly analyze . The mean/median standard deviation/interquartile range three pain scale calculate . Color change , another secondary endpoint , use assess efficacy bleach treatment . For subjective evaluation , mean standard deviation SGU baseline 30 day bleach- ing group calculate . In order evaluate whether bleach therapy effective , data SGU group submit two-way repeat measure ANOVA . A post-hoc analysis ( Tukey 's test ) use make pairwise comparison . The ΔL , Δa , Δb , ΔE value evaluate Student 's test . The data set plot histograms inspect normal distribution . Some data appear normally distribute , therefore , nonparametric statistical test use compare various treatment . Statistical analysis three pain scale compare two group three different assessment point perform use Mann- Whitney U test . Comparisons time within group perform use Friedman test . In statistical test , significance level set = 0.05. p value less equal 5 % indicated significant difference .</detailed_description>
