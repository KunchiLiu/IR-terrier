	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer may cause build-up genetic defect , damage gene within body 's cell . When gene damage , body may unable produce group protein , call cytokine , use immune system fight cancer infection . The investigational gene transfer agent EGEN-001 contains human gene cytokine interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) special carrier system design enter cell help body produce cytokines.Therefore Therefore , purpose EGEN-001 therapy attempt enhance body 's natural ability recognize fight cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Safety Biological Activity Intraperitoneal ( IP ) EGEN-001 Administered Alone Combination With Standard Chemotherapy Colorectal Peritoneal Carcinomatosis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , Phase I/II study conduct open-label , non-randomized design . The study enroll 30 patient go cytoreductive surgery HIPEC treatment 6-8 week prior enrollment . Patients treat EGEN-001 24 mg/m2 intra-peritoneally ( IP ) every week 12 week every two week disease progression intolerable toxicity , one year . Patients develop progressive metastasis receive standard chemotherapy concomitant EGEN-001 . Hence , initial EGEN-001 treatment period without chemotherapy . The standard chemotherapy regimen FOLFOX FOLFIRI administer every 2-3 week . Patient progressive disease second time take off-study . Those remain progression-free receive EGEN-001 one year .</detailed_description>
