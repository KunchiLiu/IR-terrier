	<brief_summary>The overall purpose study administer fibrinogen concentrate ( RiaSTAP , CSL Behring , Marburg , Germany ) goal treat coagulopathic bleed improve hemostasis thereby reduce overall blood product transfusion separation cardiopulmonary bypass follow aortic reconstructive surgery . With current sample size pilot study effect determine fibrinogen level response fibrinogen concentrate administer aortic reconstructive surgery . It underpowered detect reduction bleed comparison historical control include secondary outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design Open-label study Inclusion criterion Elective , adult aortic reconstruction involve hemi-arch replacement Duke University Medical Center ( DUMC ) . Exclusion criterion Concomitant procedure Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting ( CABG ) , stent ( within last 3 year ) , refusal blood transfusion , recent Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) ( within last 3 month ) , pregnancy , INR &gt; 1.1 , platelet inhibitor drug within 5 day surgery ( aspirin 325 mg within 48 hour surgery ) , platelet count &lt; 150,000 , age &lt; 18 year , inability obtain write informed consent , know coagulopathy include history recent coumadin therapy . Primary outcome variable Fibrinogen level Secondary outcome variable Total blood product unit administer post op day ( POD ) 0 , 1 , 2 , 12 24 hour chest tube drainage , ventilator time , duration oxygen dependency , renal dysfunction . Adverse event record . Study procedure The administration RiaSTAP detail flowchart . Projected milestone Based recent surgical volume assume conservative recruitment 60-70 % range plan complete study 22 patient determine budgetary constraint project 12-month study period . We plan evaluate protocol 11 ( half ) patient . Reevaluation modification may include broaden inclusion criterion and/or alter transfusion protocol depend result first 11 patient project recruitment rate . Safety monitor Adverse event record aortic database historical control form basis clinical research form ( CRF ) specifically outline define . The conduct anesthesia surgery discretion attend surgeon anesthesiologist . Following heparin reversal protamine sulphate administration 30mcg/kg DDAVP 5g aminocaproic acid per standard practice case , surgical hemorrhage exclude attend surgeon . The dose fibrinogen concentrate administer described Figure . RiaSTAP administer coagulopathic bleeding observe surgeon use treatment , prevention bleeding . It standard practice surgeon report coagulopathic bleeding ( define lack visible clot wound , soak swab blood and/or continue aspiration blood cell-saver device ) administer blood product and/or rFVIIa separation bypass follow administration protamine reverse heparin , aminocaproic acid inhibit fibrinolysis DDAVP augment platelet function . The Food Drug ( FDA ) approve dose 70mg/kg use . Following dosage fibrinogen concentrate subsequent care patient govern study protocol . Specifically , transfusion blood product suggest flow diagram transfusion guideline develop Dr Ian Welsby Dr Chad Hughes August 2009 response difficulty manage case available use , BUT apply discretion attend anesthesiologist surgeon . Proposed laboratory test addition standard care Time point 1 . Baseline Anesthesia induction 2 . Pre RiaSTAP After separation cardio pulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , desire protamine give 3 . Post RiaSTAP Ten minute RiaSTAP administer 4 . Post op On admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) 5 . Post op 24 hour surgery Plasma Heparin level ( avoid misinterpretation clot base factor assay ) Thrombin clot time ( ) Fibrinogen ( Clauss method ) Clotting Factor Levels Endogenous thrombin potential Whole blood Rotational Thromboelastometry ( ROTEM ) include Fibrinogen Test ( FIBTEM ) Lysis Test ( APTEM ) MEA platelet aggregometry ( provide CSL Behring ) 20ml blood drawn timepoint , total 100ml .</detailed_description>
