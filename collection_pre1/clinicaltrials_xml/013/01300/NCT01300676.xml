	<brief_summary>Despite evidence support benefit hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , 15 % postmenopausal woman currently use HRT ( 1 ) . The lead reason woman refuse discontinue HRT fear malignancy , side effect vaginal bleeding , weight gain , depress mood , breast tenderness , social reason regard menopause natural transition , disease require treatment . Millions woman express concern safety hormone replacement therapy since data Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) study release , report increase risk cardiovascular disease , breast cancer , stroke thromboembolic disease conjugate equine estrogen plus medroxyprogesterone acetate compare placebo ( 2 ) . The study also demonstrate quality life ( 3 ) cognition ( 4 ) good HRT group placebo group . In view problem , woman increasingly turn alternative therapy effort manage menopausal symptom ( 1 ) . Menopause associate decrease sex steroid level . The effect menopause circulate androgen level study several investigator variable finding . The level testosterone androstenedione appear show small significant decrease within first 2 year menopause , decrease testosterone amount approximately 15 % ( 5,6 ) . Unlike abrupt decrease estradiol level associate menopause , circulate testosterone , DHEA , DHEAS level decrease gradually , begin year menopause continue thereafter ( 6,7 ) . As consequence , woman may experience symptom androgen decrease period cessation menses . By give Tualang Honey postmenopausal woman , postulate symptom androgen deficiency menopausal symptom reduce . The investigator also report tualang honey give ovariectomised rat , animal model postmenopausal state two week significantly increase free testosterone progesterone plasma level , significant effect see beta-estradiol level . There significant increase thickness vaginal epithelium vaginal epithelial-muscular layer . Proliferation squamous epithelium vacuolation squamous cell note honey treat animal imply increased mucopolysacharide content . Uterine weight , endometrial circular muscle thickness significantly increase honey treat animal cystic change note gland ( 8 ) . To date , clinical study look effect Tualang Honey perimenopausal woman . In view initial evidence phytoestrogen animal study androgenic property well , beneficial effect woman term improvement menopausal symptom , change endogenous hormonal profile increase bone mineral density .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES 1 . To evaluate safety profile honey term haematological biochemical profile - haematological function - liver function - renal function 2 . To assess change cardiovascular parameter - blood pressure - waist circumference - total cholesterol - high density lipoprotein - low density lipoprotein - fast glucose 3 . To assess effect hormonal level - follicular stimulate hormone ( FSH ) - luteinizing hormone ( LH ) - testosterone - estradiol 4 . To assess effect bone density bone densitometry ( DEXA ) scan measurement . Description Methodology Study Subjects This randomize , prospective , clinical study evaluate effect honey comparison hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) . Subjects confine postmenopausal woman . The study period four month , 41 subject recruit group . A total 82 patient recruit study . Eligible subject consent participate randomly assign one two group : GROUP 1 : Subjects receive 20 g/day Tualang Honey GROUP 2 : Subjects receive hormonal replacement therapy ( Femoston ) Study Schedule About 10 ml fast blood sample collect hormonal profile baseline end study . The hormone assay serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , Luteinising Hormone ( LH ) , estradiol total testosterone . Blood also take safety profile ( haematology , liver function test liver function test ) cardiovascular parameter fast lipid fast blood sugar . Bone density check use Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry ( DEXA ) baseline end study . Subjects thoroughly examine Medical Specialists part Clinical Trial Team every 2-monthly visit . SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION The calculated sample size study base standard statistical approach , often call power calculation , widely use calculate sample size clinical trial . The formula : N = p1 x ( 100 - p1 ) + p2 x ( 100-p2 ) x f ( α , β ) ( p1 - p2 ) 2 In pre-clinical trial ( ovariectomised rat ) , 40 % increase mean testosterone level observe among low dose group . Assuming similar increase ~10 % also obtain placebo group , power 80 % , calculated number subject per group would 29 . Taken consideration 40 % drop-out rate , treatment group would therefore 41 subject . Actual calculation : Set p1 = 40 ; p2 = 10 ; α β = 7.9 N = 40 ( 100-40 ) + 10 ( 100-10 ) x 7.9 = ( 40 x 60 + 10 x 90 ) x 7.9 ( 40-10 ) 2 900 = 29 - 40 % dropout = 29+ 12 =41 subject per treatment arm There 2 group , 41 subject X 2 group = Total 82 patient need recruit . STUDY PROCEDURE Pre study screen Informed consent Healthy female , consider entry study , inform study ask would like participate . Subjects agree participate must provide informed consent prior study specific assessment procedure inform . The study fully explain subject investigator . The investigator provide subject comprehensive explanation propose treatment include , limited , nature therapy , alternative therapy , know previously experienced adverse reaction , investigational status test extract also study aim , method , anticipate benefit potential hazard study , include discomfort may experience result study participation . A summary information also provide subject writing . The subject must opportunity clarify Investigator issue understand necessary , ask question . The subject must give adequate time consider whether wish participate study . The subject must inform withdraw consent time , without penalty loss benefit patient otherwise entitle . The investigator obtain subject 's informed consent . The person , obtain informed consent , sign date informed consent form . If person investigator , investigator must also sign personally date write informed consent form . A copy patient information sheet sign consent form must provide subject . Screening procedures The following assessment perform subject screen process record Clinical Record Form - Subject initial - Demographic detail include weight height - Physical examination investigation include pelvic ultrasonography DEXA - Brief medical history relate past current illness - Concomitant medication - Collect fast blood sample follow laboratory evaluation . Patient randomisation/blinding Subject randomize use Block Randomization . The assignment Tualang Honey blind patient use ID number . Patient 's withdrawal The investigator may cease study treatment withdrew subject subject may withdraw participation study time . The reason withdrawal patient record CRF . Subject followed-up minimum 30 day follow last dose study drug . Possible reason patient withdrawal include : - The need take medication , may interfere study measurement . - Patient experience intolerable / unacceptable adverse event - Patient exhibit non-compliance protocol - Patient unwilling proceed / consent withdrawn - Investigator withdraw patient reason unrelated study drug ( e.g . undercurrent illness ) SAFETY ASSESSMENT Protocol specific clinical assessment Screening day end treatment Demographic detail record screening . The subject 's body weight , blood pressure measure 2 monthly period . Medical history adverse event At screen visit , physical examination conduct determine patient 's current medical condition past clinically significant event . This include event occur within last three month earlier event related inclusion exclusion criterion subject 's disease . This record screening visit . Throughout study period , subject directly question occurrence new sign symptom change baseline record adverse event . Diary give patient chart proper time date ingestion honey . A physical examination repeat end treatment exit evaluation assist determine change patient 's health study period . Physical examination detail record CRF , unless change baseline warrant record new adverse event change exist adverse event . Vital sign All visit Vital sign ( supine blood pressure , pulse rate ) record every visit . Patient supine semi-recumbent five minute prior evaluate vital sign . Concomitant medication Concomitant medication include co-administered drug treatment analgesic , tonic , herbal traditional medicine vitamin and/or mineral supplement . All concomitant medication take within 7 day prior commencement study drug administration duration study record CRF , include indication , dose , frequency , date route administer . SAFETY REPORTING Adverse event definition An adverse event ( AE ) define untoward medical occurrence ( include clinically significant laboratory finding ) patient clinical investigation subject administer pharmaceutical drug , necessarily causal relationship treatment . Adverse event may include : - The significant worsening disease symptom disease investigation follow administration drug - Any undercurrent illness onset administration drug - Exacerbation ( i.e . increase frequency intensity ) pre-existing condition event Serious adverse event definition A serious adverse event ( SAE ) define untoward medical occurrence dose : Results death - Is life-threatening . A ' life-threatening ' adverse event refers event , put patient risk death . It refer event , hypothetically might cause death severe . - Requires in-patient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization . Hospitalization define patient hospitalized overnight , patient 's hospital stay prolong least additional overnight stay . Hospital admission elective surgery , social reason normal disease management procedure result worsen underlie condition consider serious adverse event . - Results persistent significant disability/incapacity - Is congenital anomaly/birth defect - Is malignancy - Is result overdose ? An important medical event , jeopardize patient may require medical surgical intervention prevent one outcomes occur . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Data enter , clean analyzed use SPSS version 12 . Means standard deviation numerical variable frequency proportion categorical variable report along histogram bar chart necessary . For univariable analysis independent t-test one way ANOVA use compare numerical outcome variable among three treatment group chi square categorical outcome variable . For mutivariable analysis , repeat measure ANOVA use analysis adjust confound variable . Level significance set 5 % result present 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
