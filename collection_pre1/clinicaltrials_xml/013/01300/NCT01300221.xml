	<detailed_description>I . SPECIFIC AIMS 1 . To measure calculate Z Scores cardiac structure function use 3-DE large cohort healthy infant , child , adolescent . 2 . To investigate utility 3-DE infant , child adolescent congenital acquire heart disease . II . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Congenital heart disease ( CHD ) one common congenital malformation associate significant mortality morbidity . Acquired heart diseases also common significant impact health young . As therapeutic strategy evolve , reliable non-invasive method image cardiovascular system quantitatively assess cardiac function accuracy reproducibility pivotal define natural history , evaluate result intervention ass long-term outcome.Three-dimensional echocardiography ( 3-DE ) important clinical application CHD . Because growth throughout childhood , interpretation measurement require normalization dimension cardiac structure size body . This commonly do calculation Z score measurement interest . Currently available normative data medical literature limit one-dimensional two-dimensional echocardiography measurement . In study , generate normative data 3-DE measurement cardiac structure function large cohort healthy infant , child , adolescent . We also investigate utility 3DE assess cardiovascular structure cardiac function congenital acquire heart disease . III . DESIGN AND METHODS A . Subjects : A total 800 study subject enrol study approval Institutional Review Board . Echocardiography data prospectively collect . The subject divide 5 group : Group 1 . ( n=300 ) Patients normal cardiac anatomy function echocardiography . Group 2 . ( n=300 ) Patients various congenital heart disease . Group 3 . ( n=100 ) Patients sickle cell disease risk ventricular remodel pulmonary hypertension . Group 4 . ( n=50 ) Patients Duchenne muscular dystrophy risk ventricular remodel dysfunction . Group 5 . ( n=50 ) Patients Marfan syndrome aortic disease . B . Procedure : Before study , heart rate blood pressure obtain study subject . The subject place leave recumbent position ECG attach . After complete conventional echocardiographic assessment subject , real-time 3-DE /Doppler study perform 3-DE system . The 3-DE study take 30 minute . After study , data save processed line . Indication clinical echocardiogram include cardiac murmur , syncope chest pain normal echocardiogram . Informed consent obtain patient legal representative full explanation procedure . 1 . Conventional echocardiography All patient undergo complete 2- dimensional , color flow Doppler , spectral Doppler examination . Examination perform use commercially available ultrasound system ( IE33 system , Philips , Andover , Mass ) . All measurement make offline use computer workstation ( Xcelera , Philips Medical Systems , Andover , MA ) . All measurement make accord American Society Echocardiography protocol . For give structure , measurement make excellent unambiguous view available . 2 . Transthoracic 3-DE The 3-DE/Doppler study perform use IE33 ( Philips , Andover , MA , USA ) ultrasound machine X3-1 X7-2 matrix-array transducer . The X7-2 matrix-array transducer new tool particularly well suit small child . The patient decubitus position . Image acquisition perform apical window LV region interest base international recommendation . To encompass complete LV 3D dataset , full volume scan acquire harmonic mode four R-wave trigger subvolumes . This scan carry end-expiratory breath hold second possible . The 3D dataset store DICOM format CD-ROM transfer separate workstation off-line data analysis . C. Image off-line analysis 1 . QLAB Semiautomated Border Detection Method : A semiautomated border detection biplane LV volume analysis perform use off-line QLAB version 8.0 software ( Philips ) . The LV end-diastolic volume ( EDV ) end-systolic volume ( ESV ) ( small LV volume ) frame identified.On end-diastolic end-systolic frame , five identification point mark : septal , lateral , anterior , inferior mitral annulus apex ( either one view ) . Then software automatically delineate LV endocardial border , sequential analysis , create LV mathematical model `` cast '' represent LV cavity . 2 . TomTec Semiautomated Method : LV volume analysis perform off-line use TomTec 4D LV-Analysis software . TomTec require triplane manual trace endocardial border software select fit geometric model total LV endocardial border automatically delineate possible manual correction . Based six initial contour , spatiotemporal interpolation model ( like pulsate balloon ) create rotational temporal interpolation contour . According initial balloon , algorithm start detect endocardial border continuously entire 4D dataset ( without large gap due interpolation ) , like deform balloon LV best fit wall frame . Adjustments make manually step oblique , sagittal , coronal plane . Subsequently , final reconstruction LV model time-volume curve create . LV-EDV LV-ESV large small volume , respectively , time-volume curve . D. Data Analysis All numerical value express mean +/- standard deviation . The real- time 3-DE measurement compare clinical data measurement , cardiac catheterization magnetic resonance imaging . Statistical significance define P &lt; 0.05 . All statistical analyzes do use SAS Windows version9.1 Microsoft Excel ( Microsoft Office 2007 ) analysis .</detailed_description>
