	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect TXA127 neutrophil platelet count adult patient undergone double cord blood transplant . The study also evaluate effect TXA127 chemotherapy-induced mucositis , inflammation mucous membrane digestive tract ( mouth anus ) immune reconstitution help patient fight infection . For patient undergo CBT , neutrophil platelet normalization immune reconstitution delay . TXA127 show well tolerated patient appear induce rapid production neutrophil platelet bloodstream well increase immune system component . It also show reduce severity chemotherapy-induced mucositis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TXA127 Enhancement Engraftment Adult Double Cord Blood Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cord blood hematopoietic stem cell source multiple advantage . Cord blood normally discard birth easily collect store . Availability numerous CB bank result genetically diverse CB unit include non-Caucasians . Once suitable CB unit locate , confirmatory type quickly perform donor unit ship transplant center . Furthermore , CB graft result low incidence graft-versus-host-disease , one two antigen-mismatched unit acceptable transplantation . Despite advantage , CB significant drawback number hematopoietic stem cell obtain unit CB significantly low bone marrow ( BM ) harvest peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) harvest . Both engraftment immune reconstitution delay patient undergo CB transplant . TXA127 pharmaceutically-formulated angiotensin 1-7 , non-hypertensive derivative angiotensin II ( contain 8th amino acid confer receptor bind blood pressure receptor ) . TXA127 multilineage effect hematopoietic progenitor vitro vivo . The hematopoietic property demonstrate preclinical clinical study support investigation TXA127 reduce time neutrophil platelet engraftment follow transfusion limit number CD34+ cell .</detailed_description>
