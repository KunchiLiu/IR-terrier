	<brief_summary>Patients mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) group recognize high risk progress Alzheimer disease . Treatment MCI immunotherapy intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) could potentially reduce risk progression Alzheimer disease . This study evaluate efficacy intravenous immunoglobulin patient MCI 24 month first infusion . This study also document conversion MCI Alzheimer 's Disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Screening procedure visit 1 take place 28 day prior Visit 2 ( Day 1 ) dosing . Screening labs assessment perform screening period . A brain MRI obtain standard care within 6 month prior screen period . The first dose study drug administer Day 1 . Visits 2 6 ±1 day window occur every 14 day two month . The investigator determine subject suitable continue follow miss infusion . Visits 7 12 ( Month 4 Month 24 ) ±7 day window . All study screen data Visit 1 include laboratory result must review study eligibility prior receive first dose study drug . Visit 2 physical exam neurological exam prior infusion may occur within 72 hour prior first infusion . Prior infusion , review concomitant medication adverse event take place ensure exclude medication add medication discontinue dose change require stable . If subject continue eligible enrollment , subject randomize , infuse study medication remain infusion clinic least 4 hour follow start infusion safety assessment Visit 2 ( Day 1 ) .</detailed_description>
