	<brief_summary>The purpose study try learn small molecule kinase inhibitor medication work treat lung cancer . Crizotinib ( PF-02341066 ) drug show shrink tumor patient lung cancer . While investigator know drug work stop growth tumor depend change gene name ALK ( also call EML4-ALK ) , investigator know drug stop work . The investigator would like examine tumor help u good understand crizotinib stop work well . The tumor examine multiple test look reason crizotinib stop work .</brief_summary>
