	<brief_title>A Trial Assessing The Association Between Type Of Local Anesthesia Treatment And Postoperative Pain In Patients In Having Undergone Arrhythmia Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive pacemaker defibrillator currently give Bupivacaine , Lidocaine , mixture two local anesthetic treatment ( addition general anesthesia ) . The choice local anesthetic use surgery base primarily difference time anesthetic take effect duration thereafter . Lidocaine typically work less 1 minute last approximately 45 minute . Bupivacaine work within 2 3 minute last 4 6 hour . Lidocaine often preferable due short time effectiveness . However , relatively short duration may translate high use narcotic pain management postoperative care - particularly within first hour follow emergence general anesthesia . Therefore conceivable patient would high level pain , high cost care relate cost narcotic , high cost caregiver time require administer .</detailed_description>
