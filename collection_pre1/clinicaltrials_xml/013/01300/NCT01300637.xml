Several study evaluate effect metformin antipsychotics-induced weight gain study period last 8 16 week . Long-term metformin use robust effect metabolic dysregulation body weight non-psychiatric field . Goals : The study goal two-fold . The first goal estimate prevalence metabolic dysregulation among clozapine-treated schizophrenic patient Taiwan . The second goal ass reversal effect metformin metabolic disturbance among clozapine-treated schizophrenic patient 24-week double-blind , placebo-control trial . The investigator use metformin 1500 mg/d placebo second phase trial . Methods : This study divide two phase . The first phase estimate prevalence metabolic disturbance among clozapine-treated patient . The second randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study adjunctive metformin non-DM clozapine-treated patient . The clozapine dosage maintain unchanged study period . The eligible patient randomly assign either metformin identical placebo pill . Metformin titrate 1500 mg/day 4 week . Patients ' blood pressure ( BP ) , waist circumference , body weight , fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) , triglyceride ( TG ) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL ) , insulin , leptin measure 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 week start metformin . In 3-year period , investigator estimate recruit 150 clozapine-treated patient first phase 75 fulfill second phase criterion . The investigator estimate 60 patient complete second phase intervention ( stay second phase least 4 week ) . From study , investigator would like know prevalence metabolic dysregulation among clozapine-treated schizophrenic patient know effect metformin metabolic profile among non-DM clozapine treat patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Several study suggest clozapine great propensity available atypical antipsychotic induce weight gain metabolic dysregulation . So necessary conduct intervention prevent treat metabolic dysregulation induce clozapine . Metformin report achieve weight loss several group patient characterized insulin resistance . Several study evaluate effect metformin antipsychotics-induced weight gain study period last 8 16 week . Long-term metformin use robust effect metabolic dysregulation body weight non-psychiatric field . In recent study data show 8 week treatment metformin 1500 mg/day 24 olanzapine-treated patient , body weight , fast level glucose , triglyceride , insulin significantly decrease . Insulin secretion insulin resistance also decrease significantly . Half subject metabolic syndrome obtain improvement metformin trial . Goals : The study goal two-fold . The first goal estimate prevalence metabolic dysregulation among clozapine-treated schizophrenic patient Taiwan . The second goal ass reversal effect metformin metabolic disturbance among clozapine-treated schizophrenic patient 24-week double-blind , placebo-control trial . We use metformin 1500 mg/d placebo second phase trial . Methods : This study divide two phase . The first phase estimate prevalence metabolic disturbance among clozapine-treated patient . The second randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled study adjunctive metformin non-DM clozapine-treated patient . Patients recruit first phase meet follow criterion ( 1 ) fulfil DSM-IV criterion schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder ; ( 2 ) 18-65 year age ( 3 ) receive clozapine least 6 month . We check patient ' blood pressure ( BP ) , waist circumference , body weight , fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) , triglyceride ( TG ) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL ) , insulin , leptin measure . In study , use modify ATP III criterion Asians evaluate subject diagnosis metabolic syndrome . The inclusion criterion second phase intervention first-phase participant ( 1 ) overweight obese ( BMI ≧ 24 ) ( 2 ) one metabolic dysregulation , abdominal obesity ( waist circumference &gt; 90 cm , men &gt; 80 cm , woman ; fast hypertriglyceridemia , ( ≥ 150 mg/dL ) ; low fast HDL level ( &lt; 40 mg/dL men &lt; 50 mg/dL woman ) ; high blood pressure ( ≥ 130/ ≥ 85 mm Hg current treatment antihypertensive medication ) . The exclusion criterion follow : ( 1 ) current use hypoglycemic hypolipidemic agent ( 2 ) FPG level ≥ 126 mg/dL ; ( 3 ) woman pregnant ; ( 4 ) know allergy contraindicate metformin ( include Creatine &gt; 1.4 ng/dl ; abnormal liver function test ; chronic cardiopulmonary insufficiency ) . The clozapine dosage maintain unchanged study period . The eligible patient randomly assign either metformin identical placebo pill . Metformin titrate 1500 mg/day 4 week . Patients ' blood pressure ( BP ) , waist circumference , body weight , fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) , triglyceride ( TG ) , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL ) , insulin , leptin measure 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 24 week start metformin . In 3-year period , estimate recruit 150 clozapine-treated patient first phase 75 fulfill second phase criterion . We estimate 60 patient complete second phase intervention ( stay second phase least 4 week ) . From study , would like know prevalence metabolic dysregulation among clozapine-treated schizophrenic patient know effect metformin metabolic profile among non-DM clozapine treat patient .
