	<brief_summary>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) disable condition impairs fundamental ability , ambulation , respiration , toileting . Compromised ambulation common , devastating impairment follow SCI . Yet , despite fundamental desire walk , conventional rehabilitation regimen reliably improve ambulation SCI , many SCI patient reliable transportation access , decrease community integration access need service , include rehabilitation . Little also know subtle neural event may predict motor recovery incomplete SCI patient . This study test novel , safe , easy implement technique show promise improve gait incomplete SCI patient . The investigator expect study confirm efficacy technique , show increase speed efficiency walking . This outcome expect produce therapy improve outcome health , reduces care cost , community dwell patient incomplete SCI .</brief_summary>
