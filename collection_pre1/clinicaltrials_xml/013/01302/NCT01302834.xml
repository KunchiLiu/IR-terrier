	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective cisplatin cetuximab treat oropharyngeal cancer . PURPOSE : This phase III trial study radiation therapy cisplatin cetuximab see well work treat patient oropharyngeal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether substitution cisplatin cetuximab result comparable 5-year overall survival . Secondary - To monitor compare progression-free survival `` safety '' . - To compare patterns failure ( locoregional v distant ) . - To compare acute toxicity profile ( overall toxicity burden ) . - To compare overall quality life ( QOL ) short-term ( &lt; 6 month ) long-term ( 2 year ) . - To compare QOL Swallowing Domains short-term long-term . - To compare clinician-reported versus patient-reported CTCAE toxicity event . - To explore difference cost effectiveness cetuximab compare cisplatin . - To explore difference work status time return work . - To compare patient-reported change hear . - To compare CTCAE v. 4 late toxicity 1 , 2 , 5 year . - To evaluate effect tobacco exposure ( exposure ) measure standardized computer-assisted self interview ( CASI ) overall survival progression-free survival . - To pilot CASI collection patient report outcomes cooperative group set . - To determine whether specific molecular profile associate overall progression-free survival . - To investigate association change serum biomarkers HPV-specific cellular immune response measure baseline three month overall progression-free survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord T stage ( T1-2 v T 3-4 ) , N stage ( N0-2a v N2b-3 ) , Zubrod performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) , smoke history ( ≤ 10 pack-years v &gt; 10 pack-years ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo image-guided intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) daily day 1-4 twice daily day 5 weekly 6 week . Patients also receive high-dose cisplatin IV 1-2 hour day 1 22 . - Arm II : Beginning 1 week prior IMRT , patient receive cetuximab IV 2 hour . Patients receive cetuximab IV 1 hour weekly 7 week . Patients undergo IMRT arm I. Tumor tissue blood sample collect baseline may also collect 3- 6-month follow-up visit correlative study . Patients may complete quality-of-life questionnaire risk factor head neck cancer survey baseline , periodically study , follow-up 1 year . After completion study therapy , patient follow 1-3 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
