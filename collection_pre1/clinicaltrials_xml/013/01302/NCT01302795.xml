	<brief_title>Canakinumab Pyoderma Gangrenosum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At start study ( week 0 ) , patient receive one subcutaneous injection 150mg Canakinumab . Patients go examined week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 16 . At 2 week , patient go evaluated response Physician 's global assessment ( PGA ) target lesion . Patients PGA 0-1 go receive another injection timepoint , patient PGA 2-4 go receive another 150mg Canakinumab . At 4 week , case PGA 4 , patient go offer first second line drug alternative therapy ( corticosteroid , cyclosporin A infliximab , dosage see `` Alternative therapy case miss response '' ) stay within trial ( due long half-life canakinumab ) week 8 . At week 8 , patient PGA 0 receive another 150mg Canakinumab , patient PGA 4 go receive additional study drug , strongly encourage attend follow medical visit observation end study and/or switch first second line drug alternative therapy ( see ) . All patient PGA 1-3 receive total accumulative dose Canakinumab receive week 0 2 , namely 150 300mg . The study duration individual go 16 week . At week 8 16 , safety laboratory investigation blood differential ( Neutrophil granulocytes , monocyte , eosinophil , basophil , lymphocyte , thrombocyte , erythrocyte , hemoglobin ) , AST , ALT , y-GT , AP , Bilirubin ( total ) , Creatinine , Na , K , CRP go determine .</detailed_description>
