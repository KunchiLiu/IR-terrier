	<detailed_description>The propose protocol aim continue tumor-directed therapy typical `` break period '' effort improve local tumor response well distant disease control . First , duration completion chemoradiotherapy would increase 6-8 week 9-11 week . As noted , may allow cell death resultant pathologic downstaging . Secondly , protocol call continue systemic therapy 9-11 week period , thus allow continuation therapy direct towards primary well distant site disease . The primary aim pilot study would establish feasibility intensified neoadjuvant approach , especially respect tolerability subsequent pelvic surgery . A subsequent phase II portion evaluate efficacy treatment approach .</detailed_description>
