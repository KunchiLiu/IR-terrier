	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Rationale purpose : Rehabilitation impair cognitive process come standard component medical care traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) stroke ( Cicerone , Dahlberg , Malec , Langenbahn , Felicitti , Kneipp , et al. , 2005 ) , sometimes patient infection brain , hypoxic brain damage , progressive condition ( Wilson , 2008 ) . The objective study determine effect recently develop cognitive rehabilitation program ; Goal Management Training ( GMT ) executive function people SB cognitive complaint . To date , research effort focus categorize cognitive impairment SB research direct towards rehabilitation impairment . Given extent , nature , ramification cognitive impairment SB , study compensatory-based cognitive rehabilitation teach management strategy GMT may beneficial population . The research question study ( 1 ) What effect GMT cognitive executive function ? Furthermore , effect GMT subjective informant evaluation executive functioning ? ( 2 ) What effect GMT mental health quality life ? ( 3 ) What effect GMT cop strategy ? There 6 month follow-up regard research question . It expect GMT favourable effect executive functioning , psychological health related factor patient SB . BACKGROUND : Medical cognitive aspect Spina bifida ( SB ) : SB birth defect cause incomplete neural tube development , result protrusion spinal cord , meninges , nerve root open spine . SB disorder associate variety brain abnormality , usually include congenital malformation cerebellum hindbrain ( Chiari II ) half case , partial dysgenesis corpus callosum ( Barkovich , 2000 ) . Hydrocephalus occur 95 % child disorder , 80-90 % require shunting ( Fletcher et al. , 2005 ) . SB represent complicated series neural insult begin prior birth , persist effect development , include problem orthopaedic , cognitive , behavioural domain ( Barkovich , 2000 ; Dicianno , Kurowski , Yang , et al. , 2008 ) . Executive dysfunction : Executive function high level cognitive operation involve control direction low level function . Patients executive dysfunction may experience , problem deal novel situation , problem form reasonable plan take account relevant detail , problem inhibit habitual response situation inappropriate , increased distractibility , problem sustain attention task time keep goal on-line , impaired monitoring error-correction behavioural output , low motivation , lack foresight regard effect one 's behaviour , difficulty regulate emotional state , poor insight one 's difficulty ( Levine , Stuss , Winocur , Binns , et al. , 2007 ) . Executive dysfunction examine present study major implication deficit cognitive domain patient . Although executive dysfunction often associate frontal lobe damage , also result damage brain area . Damage frontal-subcortical white matter circuit , commonly occur SB , disrupt communication prefrontal cortex area brain ( Dennis et al. , 2006 ) . Cognitive rehabilitation : Cognitive rehabilitation define process whereby people brain injury work together professional staff others remediate alleviate cognitive deficit arise neurological insult ( Wilson , 2008 ) . Treatment goal may vary , major goal cognitive rehabilitation enable people disability function adequately possible environment ( Wilson , 2008 ) . The effectiveness cognitive rehabilitation well document within domain patient stroke TBI ( e.g. , Cicerone et al. , 2000 , 2005 ; Wilson , 2008 ; Rees et al. , 2007 ) . The cognitive domain focus present study executive functioning . Interventions within domain , Goal Management Training ( GMT ) , include explicitly direct towards bridge gap intention action , deficit describe `` goal neglect '' intervention target towards re-establishing endogenous control behaviour . Goal Management Training ( GMT ) : The present study translate , use intervention protocol originally develop teach patient brain injury strategy improve ability plan activity structure intention ; GMT . GMT aim increase participant ' understand goal management problem , give vocabulary describe problem , give set technique compensate . GMT evaluate 30 patient mild severe brain injury , randomly assign group receive GMT motor skill train . Participants follow GMT show significant gain everyday paper-and-pencil task design mimic task problematic patient deficit executive functioning ( Levine , Robertson , Clare , Carter , Hong , &amp; Wilson , et al. , 2000 ) . Furthermore , Levine et al . ( 2007 ) also apply version protocol sample 49 elderly subjective cognitive complaint result indicate improvement simulate real-life task self-rated executive deficit . These gain maintain long-term follow-up . Moreover , Dutch study ( van Hooren et al. , 2007 ) involve 37 old adult executive difficulty , participant intervention group significantly less annoyed cognitive failure , well able manage executive failure report less anxiety symptom wait list control group receive GMT . METHODS : The study experimental repeat measure design one treatment group ( n=24 ) one control group ( n=14 ) , total ( n=38 ) . Procedure : All patient age 20 45 register TRS national resource centre rare disorder Norway ask participate study ( n=201 ) . Along invitation self-report questionnaire , Behavior Rating Inventory Executive Function-Adult Version ( BRIEF-A ) , respondent fill return . Inclusion patient base upon one elevate scale Metacognition Index ( MI ) . Fifty-three ( n=53 ) subject respond return BRIEF-A questionnaire , fulfil inclusion criterion . The baseline measurement fifty-three ( n=53 ) subject randomise control trial ( RCT ) do . At baseline participant fill questionnaire concern cognitive functioning , mental health , quality life , cop . Furthermore , neuropsychological assessment conduct . Additionally , Dysexecutive Questionnaire BRIEF-A informant report form fill adult informant familiar rat individual 's everyday functioning . Six subject exclude baseline meet exclusion criterion , six subject meet inclusion criterion could follow programme time hospitalization/illness , three subject could follow programme time school/education . After baseline measurement participant randomly assign GMT control group ( wait list ) . The method randomisation block design block size 2 , stratification age education . Twenty-four ( n=24 ) subject assign GMT , six subject GMT train group . The GMT structure seven module . Each module design run approximately two hour . As , subject stay TRS three day go module 1 2 . Then go home month , come back stay three day go module 3 , 4 5 . Once , go home month , come go module 6 7 . GMT consist task perform training design illustrate goal management concept action , homework assignment design facilitate transfer concept real life . Both control group intervention group assess immediately intervention group complete intervention , 6 month .</detailed_description>
