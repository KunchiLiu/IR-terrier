	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Olesoxime ( TRO19622 ) 3-25 Years SMA Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study multicenter , double-blind , randomize , adaptive , parallel group , placebo control 3-stage study patient SMA type 2 non ambulant type 3 . Stage 1 DMC 3-month safety assessment : An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) ass safety olesoxime every 3 month . Stage 2 Efficacy/futility analyse one year : A first interim efficacy analysis perform patient treat one year ( 52 week ) order ass need continue study reach plan objective . In event positive significant result favor olesoxime , study consider successful patient switch olesoxime allow assessment sustainability treatment effect safety . If result significantly favor placebo , study discontinue failure ( futility ) . Stage 3 Efficacy safety analysis two year : The expect study duration 2 year ( 104 week ) show efficacy . If study discontinue futility medication regimen change due success , study therefore continue plan completion i.e . 104 week .</detailed_description>
