	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Dolutegravir HIV-1 Infected Infants , Children , Adolescents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DTG HIV medicine integrase inhibitor drug class . The purpose study evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerability , antiviral activity DTG HIV-1 infect infant , child , adolescent . Participation study last approximately 48 week , follow long-term safety follow-up last least 3 year . Participants may receive antiretroviral ( ARV ) medication study ; medication prescribe participant ' doctor provide study . This study two stage . Stage I evaluate short term tolerability safety DTG , allow selection dose study Stage II . Stage II provide long-term safety , tolerability , efficacy data DTG . Participants assign one nine cohort depend age ( 4 week young 18 year age ) . Participants cohorts I IIA receive DTG film-coated tablet orally twice daily , depend ARV medication receive ; participant cohorts IIB , III , IV , V receive DTG granule oral suspension twice daily , depend ARV medication receive ; participant cohorts III-DT , IV-DT , V-DT receive DTG dispersible tablet orally twice daily , depend ARV medication receive . ( All nine cohort include Stage I study ; however , Stage II study include cohort IIB ) . Stage I participants undergo physical examination blood drawn 10 study visit , occur Day 0 ; Day 5 ( +5 day ) ; Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 . Stage I participant also blood drawn 8 time 24 hour Day 5 ( +5 day ) study visit measure amount drug blood stream . Stage II participant undergo physical examination blood drawn study visit ( Day 0 ; Day 10 ; Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 ) . Blood , plasma , urine also store tested measure immune response . Females childbearing potential undergo pregnancy test every study visit . Questionnaires assessment perform select study visit . After 48 week , participant enter long-term safety follow-up continue receive DTG . During time , participant undergo physical examination , blood collection , questionnaire study visit ( every 12 week minimum 3 year ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At least 4 week young 18 year age study entry Confirmed HIV1 infection define positive result two sample collect different time point ( see protocol information ) Subjects must belong one ARV exposure group : 1 ) ARVtreatment experience ( include receipt ARVs prophylaxis PMTCT ) Previously take ARVs treatment , currently take ARVs : Must treatment great equal 4 week , OR Currently take ARVs treatment failing : Must unchanged , fail therapeutic regimen within 4 12 week prior screen ( less equal 1 log drop HIV1 RNA within 4 12 week prior screen ) . NOTE : Dose adjustment growth formula substitution ( i.e. , switch single agent fix dose combination ) permit 4 12 week period . Substitutions one ARV within class toxicity tolerability management , discontinuation ARVs also allow within 4 12 week period . OR For subject le 2 year age , initiate ARVs treatment le 4 week prior screen . 2 ) ARV treatment naive ( exposure ARVs treatment ; could receive ARVs prophylaxis PMTCT ) Age le 2 year If infant receive nevirapine ( NVP ) prophylaxis prevent mother child transmission ( PMTCT ) , must receive NVP least 14 day prior enrollment Stage I II . HIV1 RNA viral load great 1,000 copies/mL plasma screen . NOTE : For subject enrol cohort IV , IVDT , V , VDT , HIV RNA test perform screening may pending time enrollment . If screen HIV RNA less equal 1000 c/mL , subject discontinue study drug ( see protocol information ) . Demonstrated ability willingness swallow assign study medication . NOTE : Film coat tablet MAY NOT crush dissolve . Dispersible tablet MAY NOT cut must use five milligram interval . Parent legal guardian able willing provide sign informed consent . Female subject child bear potential engage sexual activity could lead pregnancy , must use two adequate birth control method study two week stop study drug . Hormonal birth control alone ( e.g. , pill , shot , slow release insert place under/on skin ) would consider adequate . An effective , medically accept barrier method contraception ( e.g. , female/male condom , diaphragm cervical cap cream gel kill sperm ( exclude nonoxydyl9 ) , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , others ) also must use study . Condoms recommend appropriate use contraception method effective prevent HIV1 transmission . Males engage sexual activity could lead HIV1 transmission must use condom . Optimized background therapy ( OBT ) : Subjects age great equal 2 year age ( Cohorts I , II , III , IIIDT ) must available least one fully active drug OBT enroll . Historical genotype obtain within 1 year screening consider Protocol Team determination fully active drug screen genotype test inconclusive . Subjects less 2 year age ( Cohorts IV , IVDT , V , VDT ) enroll genotype testing obtain result pending . Note : Subjects enrol genotype result pending find active drug per genotype perform screen discontinue study drug ( information find protocol ) . However , subject great 1 log drop HIV RNA 4 week continue study drug approval Protocol Team . Presence active AIDSdefining opportunistic infection At enrollment , subject weigh less 3.0 kg Known Grade 3 great follow laboratory toxicity within 30 day prior study entry : neutrophil count , hemoglobin , platelet , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , lipase , serum creatinine total bilirubin . A single repeat within 30 day allow eligibility determination . NOTE : Grade 3 great total bilirubin allowable , subject atazanavir ( ATV ) . ANY known Grade 4 laboratory toxicity within 30 day prior study entry . NOTE : Grade 4 total bilirubin allowable , subject ATV . The following liver toxicity within 30 day prior study entry : ALT great 3x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AND direct bilirubin great 2x ULN Any prior history malignancy , exception localize malignancy squamous cell basal cell carcinoma skin Clinical symptomatic evidence pancreatitis , determine clinician Use disallow medication time screening ( see protocol complete list disallow medication ) Known history exposure integrase inhibitor treatment subject subject 's mother prior delivery/cessation breastfeed Known resistance integrase inhibitor Women pregnant breastfeeding . Subject currently participate participate study compound device commercially available within 30 day sign informed consent , unless permission Protocol Teams grant Subject unlikely adhere study procedure , keep appointment , plan relocate study nonIMPAACT study site Any clinically significant disease ( HIV infection ) clinically significant finding screen medical history physical examination , investigator 's opinion , would compromise outcome study Subject use , anticipate use , chronic systemic immunosuppressive agent systemic interferon ( e.g. , treatment hepatitis C virus [ HCV ] infection ) within 30 day prior begin DTG study treatment . Systemic corticosteroid ( e.g. , prednisone equivalent 2 mg/kg/day ) replacement therapy short course ( less equal 30 day ) permit . ( See protocol information disallow medication . ) Any condition would , opinion site investigator , place subject unacceptable risk injury render subject unable meet requirement protocol . Active tuberculosis ( TB ) disease and/or requirement treatment include rifampin time screen visit . However , subject need rifampin treatment DTG allow continue P1093 provide DTG dose adjust accord protocol .</criteria>
