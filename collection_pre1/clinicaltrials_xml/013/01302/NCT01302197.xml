	<brief_summary>Stroke , lead cause disability age population , increase risk diabetes , subsequent stroke recurrence , cardiovascular disease complication . The downsize private federal health care resource , along anticipated increase stroke rate population age , mandate alternative strategy develop reduce public health burden stroke . This pilot study may facilitate knowledge time paretic leg muscle atrophy , fiber type shift , progression worsen glucose tolerance stroke . Knowledge skeletal muscle change occur sub-acute stroke period essential create new guideline incorporate exercise rehabilitation , much like cardiac rehabilitation , order facilitate improve health care veteran stroke survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The vast majority cerebrovascular accident report person old 55 year age occur 780,000 person year U.S. As adult population age , number stroke United States anticipate double , reach nearly 1.5 million annually year 2050 . Following stroke , patient remain continued high risk recurrent stroke almost third suffer recurrent stroke within 5 year , even despite optimal medical management . Age cardiac disease among important longitudinal predictor cardiovascular health outcome survival stroke . Notably , 75 % chronic stroke survivor residual disability emphasize need rehabilitation strategy . Knowledge skeletal muscle change occur early phase stroke essential create new guideline incorporate exercise rehabilitation , much like cardiac rehabilitation , order facilitate improve health care stroke survivor .</detailed_description>
