	<brief_summary>PRI-724 new investigational drug study treat subject cancer advance solid tumor . PRI-724 think work block Wnt signal pathway cancer cell need grow spread ( metastasize ) . Phase Ia : Patient cohort solid tumor malignancy treat escalate dos ( per cohort ) PRI-724 order identify MTD single-agent regimen . PRI-724 dose start 40 mg/m2/day , CIV infusion 24 hour × 7 day . Phase Ib : This phase begin upon identification MTD Phase 1a . Patient cohort CRC treat escalate dos ( per cohort ) PRI-724 administer combination modify regimen FOLFOX6 ( mFOLFOX 6 , standardize dos schedule ) order identify MTD combine regimen . Up 2 dose level PRI-724 examine ( 640 905 mg/m2/day , CIV infusion 24 hour × 7 day ) , potential evaluate previously unexamined intermediate dose , indicate , fully characterize tolerability . The MTD cohort ( maximum dose study ) expand 12 patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives - Determine MTD PRI-724 administer 7-day CIV intravenous infusion patient solid tumor ( Phase Ia ) . - Determine MTD PRI-724 administer 7-day CIV infusion combination mFOLFOX6 patient colorectal carcinoma ( Phase Ib ) . Secondary Objectives - Describe dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) adverse event profile PRI-724 administer 7-day CIV infusion either alone patient solid tumor , combination mFOLFOX6 patient colorectal carcinoma . - Determine pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile PRI-724 C-82 administer 7-day CIV infusion patient population ( In Phase 1b PK assessment perform expanded MTD cohort patient ) . - Obtain preliminary assessment anti-tumor activity manifest response treatment patient population . - Measure mRNA expression survivin reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) , pre- post-treatment PRI-724 : - In circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) - In tumor biopsy specimen CRC patient ( Phase Ib ) Also , evaluate whether survivin expression CTC consistent reflective expression tumor specimen . - Obtain preliminary assessment potential association survivin may impact pharmacodynamic ( PD ) property PRI-724 clinical outcome , toxicity PK parameter - Assess effect Wnt inhibitor C-82 hair follicle neogenesis amount collagen expression Exploratory Objective • Obtain matrix metalloproteinase-7 ( MMP7 ) level serum via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) test Study Design : During Phase Ia portion , accelerate titration design , specifically , design 4A ( within-patient dose escalation ) use , begin start dose 40 mg/m2/day . This involve initial accelerate ( double-step ) dose escalation phase follow standard 3+3 design ( single-step ) dose escalation phase . In initial accelerated phase , cohorts one new patient treat per dose level double-step dose escalation use . The accelerated phase end first instance DLT observe cycle treatment , second patient experience moderate toxicity ( MT ) cycle . The cohort current dose level expand standard 3+3 design phase ( single-step ) dose escalation start subsequent cohort . In study , accelerate phase end Dose Level 9 ( 640 mg/m2/day ) , unless toxicity criterion terminate accelerated phase meet earlier . During accelerated phase , decision escalate , expand , de-escalate make patient current dose level complete one cycle ( 2 week ) PRI-724 , receive least 75 % plan PRI-724 dose , experience MT DLT . During standard 3+3 phase , decision escalate , expand , de-escalate make patient current dose level complete two cycle ( 4 week ) PRI-724 receive least 75 % plan PRI-724 dose , experience DLT . During Phase Ib portion , dose escalation patient CRC begin Level 9 dos evaluated Phase Ia ( 640 mg/m2/day ) . Up 2 dose level evaluate ( 640 905mg/m2/day ; potential evaluate previously unexamined intermediate dose , indicate ) use standard 3+3 design ( single-step dose escalation ) . Decisions escalate , expand , de-escalate make patient current dose level complete two cycle ( 4 week ) PRI-724 plus mFOLFOX6 ( i.e. , 2 course PRI-724 2 course mFOLFOX6 ) , receive least 75 % plan PRI-724 dose , experience DLT . In Phase 1a Phase 1b , decision escalate , expand , de-escalate cohort may make Sponsor Investigator ( ) absence define DLT determine dose level impractical due frequency nature toxicities meet DLT criterion . In case particular dose deem impractical , next low dose cohort may expand investigation . Once additional safety data available , consideration may give toward identify low dose MTD recommend Phase 2 dose . Throughout study , enrollment stagger first second patient new cohort , allow one cycle ( 2 week ) elapse prior enrol second patient cohort . The following toxicity consider Investigator least possibly relate study therapy ( study therapy plus chemotherapy ) define DLTs : Non-Hematological DLTs : - All Grade 3-4 non-hematologic toxicity represent 2 grade increase baseline , exclude : - Untreated inadequately treat nausea , vomit diarrhea - Alopecia - Grade 3 fatigue return Grade 2 low within 7 day - Grade 3 laboratory and/or metabolic abnormality return Grade 2 low within 72 hour despite treatment - QTcF &gt; 500 msec OR increase QTc 60 msec baseline Hematologic DLTs : - Grade 4 neutropenia - Grade 4 thrombocytopenia - Neutropenic fever - ≥ Grade 3 anemia unresponsive supportive care include blood transfusion and/or erythropoietin therapy - Grade 3 thrombocytopenia clinically significant bleed The DLT observation period , measure start infusion first day , 2 week accelerate phase Phase Ia portion , 4 week 3 + 3 phase Phase Ia Phase Ib portion trial . Moderate toxicity ( MT ) define ≥ Grade 2 toxicity ( except alopecia ) consider Investigator least possibly relate study therapy qualify DLT . During Phase Ia portion , MTD define high dose level test patient 1 patient experience DLT attributable study drug ( ) , least 6 patient treat dose evaluable toxicity . The MTD one dose level maximally administer dose ( MAD ) , low dose level test 2 patient experienced DLT attributable study drug ( ) . In Phase Ia least 6 patient treated MTD . During Phase Ib portion , MTD define high dose level test patient 1 patient experience DLT attributable study drug ( ) , least 6 patient treat dose evaluable toxicity , &lt; 33.3 % patient experience DLT attributable study drug ( ) 7 12 patient treat dose evaluable toxicity . ( This would allow 2 DLTs 7 9 patient enrolled expansion cohort 3 DLTs 10 12 patient enrolled expansion cohort . ) The MTD one dose level MAD low dose test &gt; 1 patient 3- 6-patient cohort , &gt; 33.3 % patient expand 7- 12-patient cohort , experience DLT attributable study drug ( ) . In Phase Ib least 12 patient treated MTD . There potential expansion lower dose cohort 12 patient initially identify expand MTD cohort find exceed tolerability .</detailed_description>
