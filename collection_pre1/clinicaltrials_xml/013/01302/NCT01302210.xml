	<detailed_description>The primary endpoint measure reduction MRSA colonization prevalence ( rate ) intervention arm compare control arm . One secondary endpoint compare rate MRSA disease intervention control arm . The secondary endpoint determine cost MRSA screen decolonization compare cost MRSA disease treatment ( medication cost expense need hospitalization therapy MRSA infection therapy ) control arm . Achieving primary goal MRSA control also demonstrate two secondary goal wthe investigator aim achieve : one scientific , planned approach issue specific healthcare-associated infection LTCFs solve problem partnership acute long-term care beneficial deal patient safety quality practice across United Sates Healthcare continuum .</detailed_description>
