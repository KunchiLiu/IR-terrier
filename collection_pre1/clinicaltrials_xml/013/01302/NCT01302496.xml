	<brief_summary>The CTLA-4 block monoclonal antibody ipilimumab ( MDX-010 , BMS-734016 ) , demonstrate anti-tumor activity subgroup patient Stage III ( unresectable ) Stage IV melanoma ( measurable per modify WHO criterion ) , receive prior treatment regimen ( non-experimental experimental ) , except CD-137 agonist CTLA4 inhibitor agonist relapse , fail respond ( CR PR ) tolerate regimen ( Wolchok , Neyns et al . 2009 ; O'Day , Maio et al . 2010 ) . Ipilimumab exert therapeutic effect presumably activate T-lymphocytes infiltrate tumor mass destroy malignant cell mechanisms cytotoxic cellular interaction . Autologous TriMix-DC vaccine induce T-cell repertoire recognize HLA-restricted way melanoma associate antigens MAGE-A3 , MAGE-C2 , tyrosinase gp100 . Administration ipilimumab together TriMix-DC vaccine therapy may effective treatment patient advance melanoma compare either modality alone .</brief_summary>

The following paragraph mandatory protocol include Women Childbearing Potential . 13 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 26 week last dose investigational product , manner risk pregnancy minimize . In general , decision appropriate method prevent pregnancy determine discussion investigator study subject . WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopause define : Amenorrhea &gt; 12 consecutive month without another cause , For woman irregular menstrual period take hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL . Women use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( eg , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . WOCBP must negative serum urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour start ipilimumab . Men father potential must use adequate method contraception avoid conception throughout study [ 26 week last dose investigational product ] manner risk pregnancy minimize . 14 . Adequate venous access allow leukapheresis procedure . 1 . Evidence brain metastasis brain imaging ( i.e. , MRI contrast CT ) ; 2 . Primary ocular mucosal melanoma ; 3 .

Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric physical ( eg , infectious ) illness . 13 . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) , define Section 4.1 , : unwilling unable use acceptable method contraception avoid pregnancy entire study period least 8 week cessation study drug , positive pregnancy test baseline , pregnant breastfeeding . Sexually active WOCBP must use effective method birth control course study , manner risk failure minimize . Before study enrollment , WOCBP must advise importance avoid pregnancy study participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . All WOCBP MUST negative pregnancy test first receive ipilimumab . If pregnancy test positive , patient must receive ipilimumab must enrol study . 14 .
