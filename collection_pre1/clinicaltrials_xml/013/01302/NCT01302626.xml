	<detailed_description>1 . Treatment lung cancer Lung cancer common cause cancer death The Netherlands , annual incidence exceed 8,000 . Two main variant lung cancer identify : small cell non-small cell lung cancer ( SCLC NSCLC respectively ) , latter comprise approximately 80 % lung cancer case . Despite treatment improvement , prognosis NSCLC remain poor , median survival 8 month diagnosis , 5 year survival le 13 % . Radiotherapy play key role treatment NSCLC . Over year , radiotherapeutical treatment option increase tremendously . These include dose escalation , intensive schedule concurrent chemo-radiotherapy . These schedule improve local control survival patient . However , also induce toxicity , radiation oncologist face challenge task choose optimal therapy patient : take account tumor characteristic well patient 's condition . In word : physician must estimate expect therapeutic ratio often background insufficient outcome information . The problem arise therapy lung cancer , chemotherapy surgery . In early disease , surgery mainstay treatment lung cancer patient . This combined neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . 2 . Prediction response A major problem lung cancer management lack data deal predictive factor prognosis treatment outcome . The currently use stag system ( TNM ) accurately predict outcome within homogeneous treatment group . As result , individualize therapeutic ratio calculate , lead either over- under-treatment many patient hamper optimization therapy . Attempts undertaken refine improve risk stratification , lead development several prediction model . The performance model usually express Area Under Curve ( AUC ) Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) . The maximum value AUC 1.0 ; indicate perfect prediction model . A value 0.5 indicate patient correctly classify 50 % case , e.g . good chance . While high prediction accuracy ( AUC=0.85 ) achieve population NSCLC patient stage , treat different modality , challenge task predict survival accurately focus subgroup . A pretreatment prediction model patient treat surgery yield AUC 0.61 pretreatment model patient treat radiotherapy result AUC 0.75 . Further improvement radiotherapy model obtain add information blood biomarkers extend model yield AUC 0.83 . Investigating blood biomarkers possible combination biomarkers challenge result underline importance use data addition clinical imaging parameter . Survival remain certainly outcome major importance , last decade treatment-related outcome measure , radiation induce lung injury esophageal damage , become important evaluation treatment result . Pneumonitis radiation induce lung injury subject many study . However , result quite difficult interpret , many different variable , dosimetric parameter well treatment patient relate characteristic , identify , study show inconsistent even conflict result , sample size often limited . Recently , Chen et al . publish neural network model prediction grade 2 high pneumonitis , yield AUC 0.74 test dataset31 . Compared model , result promise , although external validation model warrant used clinical practice . Our group develop model predict dyspnea ≥ grade 2 accord CTCv3.0 . Patient well dosimetric parameter incorporate model , result cross-validated AUC 0.62 . In summary , exist model perform rather well , lot room improvement add new factor well apply advanced model build technique . Prediction model still develop number clinically relevant outcome . Finally , incorporate confidence interval prediction well quantify gain prediction precision certain diagnostic/ prognostic test perform , would certainly great value clinical use model ( http : //www.predictcancer.org/ ) . 3 . Strategies improve prediction model lung cancer In order improve prediction model survival well toxicity outcome one include many variable possible predictor include imaging , genomics proteomics information . 3.1 Imaging An important feature prognosis FDG-PET-scan maximal Standardized Uptake Value ( SUVmax ) . There statistically significant difference 2-year survival patient high pretreatment SUV low pretreatment SUV . Patients low SUVmax 2-year survival 90.6 % , patient high SUVmax 2-year survival 58.6 % . There significant correlation high SUVmax high HIF1α stain biopsy , marker hypoxia . Non significant relation show CA IX , Ki67 Glut-1 SUVmax . Besides FDG , new PET-tracers develop . One new tracer HX4 , hypoxia tracer . Regulation tissue oxygen homeostasis critical cell function , proliferation survival . Evidence continue accumulate along understand complex oxygen-sensing pathway present within cell . The microenvironment tumor particular oxygen heterogeneous , hypoxic area , may explain much difficulty treat cancer effectively . This true comparing level hypoxia among different patient tumor , also within individual tumor . Accumulating evidence implicates biological response hypoxia alteration pathway cancer important contributor overall malignancy treatment efficacy . This recently prompt several investigation possibility image target treatment biological response hypoxia . 3.2 Gene signature Analysis gene signature help improve predictive value model . An example , proliferation signature investigate Starmans et al . Two different signature 110 gene compare prognostic value . Both show good prognostic value breast cancer data set . The AUC ( area curve ) improve proliferation signature add model clinical factor . Another gene profile test early stage NSCLC . This profile consist 72 gene validate stage I II NSCLC patient five center . It possible identify early-stage NSCLC patient high low risk disease recurrence death within 3 year primary surgical treatment . 3.3 Tumor biopsy Hypoxia ( besides serum ) also measurable tissue . Several marker hypoxia predictive survival . An example HIF1α , upregulated case hypoxia . A high staining HIF1α correlate bad prognosis NSCLC . CA IX correlate severe chronic hypoxia , strong association poor outcome NSCLC . Another marker Ki67 , express proliferate cell . A high Ki67 indicate proliferation , systemic review Martin et . al . bad prognosis show Ki67 expression increase . 3.4 Application machine learn technique The availability genomic data , together improve imaging modality , lead unprecedented amount biological medical data , dealt use computational method , store data , also integrate , analyze , display eventually understand . Machine learn offer number technique purpose . These technique overcome problem encounter conventional statistical method especially data highly correlate , many variable available limited number patient ( high-dimensional data ) , many different model test predictive value . In field radiotherapy especially prediction treatment response , machine learn upcoming modality . Successes traditional statistic already publish 43and first promise result build predictive model concern survival non-small-cell lung-cancer already find literature .</detailed_description>
