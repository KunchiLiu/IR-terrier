	<criteria>1 . Multiple myeloma 2 . Measurable disease base central laboratory value , define one follow criterion ( assess within 21 day prior randomization ) : Serum Mprotein Serum protein electrophoresis ( SPEP ) : ≥ 0.5 g/dL For immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) patient whose disease reliably measure serum quantitative immunoglobulin ( qIgA ) : &gt; 750 mg/dL ( 0.75 g/dL ) Urine Bence Jones protein : ≥ 200 mg/24 h 3 . Responsive ( define 25 % great decrease Mprotein total protein ) least one line prior therapy 4 . Relapsed multiple myeloma , define disease progression least 1 prior treatment regimen 5 . Refractory multiple myeloma , define meet one following : Nonresponsive recent therapy ( eg , stable disease , progressive disease treatment ) Disease progression within 60 day discontinuation recent therapy 6 . Received 3 prior therapeutic regimen multiple myeloma 7 . Adequate prior treatment bortezomib ( less 4 complete cycle , reason discontinuation must review Medical Monitor reason document ) 8 . Prior treatment immunomodulatory agent ( lenalidomide , available , and/or thalidomide ) 9 . Prior treatment alkylating agent ( standard highdose ) 10 . Prior treatment corticosteroid 11 . Criterion longer applicable ( Amendment 2 , Criterion 11 , requirement `` prior treatment anthracycline unless clinically indicate '' remove . ) 12 . Age ≥ 18 year 13 . Life expectancy least 1 month 14 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 15 . Adequate hepatic function , serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 4 time upper limit normal serum bilirubin &lt; 2.5 mg/dL ( 42.5 µmol/L ) . Patients total bilirubin ≥ 2.5 mg/dL may enrol serum direct bilirubin &lt; 2.5 mg/dL . 16 . Total white blood cell ( WBC ) count ≥ 1.5 × 10^9/L absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.0 × 10^9/L ( use colonystimulating factor achieve count allow ) 17 . Hemoglobin ≥ 7.5 g/dL ( 75 g/L ) Use erythropoietic stimulating factor allow : For patient receive red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion within 28 day obtain Screening hemoglobin value . The following information must provide Medical Monitor 's review assessment eligibility : Pretransfusion hemoglobin ( Hb ) Number RBC unit administer Use erythropoietic stimulating factor 18 . Platelet count ≥ 30 × 10^9/L There restriction platelet transfusion thrombopoietic growth factor screen period For patient receive platelet transfusion within 7 day obtain Screening platelet value , follow information must provide Medical Monitor 's review assessment eligibility Pretransfusion platelet count Number platelet unit administer Use thrombopoietic growth factor 19 . Creatinine clearance ( CrCl ) ≥ 15 mL/minute ( either measure calculate use standard formula Cockcroft Gault ) dialysisindependent 20 . Written inform consent accordance regulatory guideline 21 . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day first dose study treatment agree use effective method contraception study 3 month follow last dose study treatment . Postmenopausal female ( &gt; 45 year old without menses &gt; 1 year ) surgically sterilize female exempt requirement . Male patient must use effective barrier method contraception study 3 month follow last dose sexually active female childbearing potential . 1 . Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia IgM myeloma 2 . Refractory prior therapy 3 . Disease measurable serum free light chain assay ( SFLC ) 4 . POEMS syndrome ( polyneuropathy , organomegaly , endocrinopathy , monoclonal protein , skin change ) 5 . Plasma cell leukemia ( &gt; 2.0 × 10^9/L circulate plasma cell standard differential ) 6 . Prior carfilzomib treatment 7 . Chemotherapy ( approve investigational ) within 14 day prior randomization 8 . Immunotherapy antibody therapy within 28 day prior randomization 9 . Corticosteroid therapy dose equivalent dexamethasone &gt; 4 mg/day within 14 day prior randomization 10 . Radiotherapy within 7 day prior randomization 11 .
