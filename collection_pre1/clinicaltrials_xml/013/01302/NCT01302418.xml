	<brief_summary>The study conduct use nasopharyngeal swab specimen collect prospectively individual suspect sign symptom acute respiratory tract infection cause respiratory virus . A series standard viral culture test validate routine use clinical laboratory , and/or series PCR-based Laboratory Developed Tests ( PCR-LDT ) validate central reference laboratory use verify performance investigational artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel test . From specimen five ( 5 ) aliquot prepare : ( ) one aliquot test real-time use assigned viral culture reference method ; ( b ) one aliquot use extract nucleic acid real-time investigational testing ; ( c ) one aliquot specimen store -- 70C subsequent shipment reference laboratory PCR-LDT testing , ( ) one aliquot archive -70C subsequent follow-up reference laboratory ( e.g. , bi-directional sequence positive specimen ) , ( e ) remain specimen store Fresh v . Frozen Study . The extracted nucleic acid generate second aliquot ( i.e. , `` b '' ) split subject test artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test ResPlex II Advanced Panel test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each year morbidity mortality associate acute respiratory tract infection fluctuate seasonally . This rise fall associate change prevalence respiratory virus population . Myriad respiratory virus responsible infection . For example , Influenza Virus , Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) , Parainfluenza Virus , Human Metapneumovirus , Rhinovirus , Adenovirus identify cause acute infection . Numerous pathogenic subtypes identify within viral group . The outbreak Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) 2003 eventually identify Coronavirus ; mortality SARS among elderly high 50 % . More recently , Human Bocavirus ( HBoV ) also identify cause acute respiratory tract infection . In 2005 HBoV identify molecular test find virus identify subpopulation patient suffer respiratory tract infection . Apart supportive measure ( e.g. , bed rest , hydration , etc . ) , effective treatment many viral infection ; however , antiviral agent ( e.g. , neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir zanamivir ) use alleviate severity flu-like symptom . Identification respiratory virus causative agent important eliminates need treatment antibiotic ; physician typically wait 7-10 day symptom alleviate prescribe antibiotic due risk associate exacerbate bacterial antibiotic resistance . Each year virus population fluctuates , antigenic presentation dominant strain circulate population . Epidemics arise large large portion population innate acquire immunological resistance strain ( ) give season . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) maintain separate website dedicate track outbreak influenza , especially avian influenza ( http : //www.who.int/fluvirus_tracker ) . These zoonotic transmission adapt enable human-to-human transmission great concern predict virtually human immunologically naïve . Zoonotic transmission human population monitor hope pandemic similar Spanish Flu 1918 avoid ; estimate well 25 million people die Spanish Flu . The United States government also maintain separate website resource regard flu pandemic relate information ( http : //www.pandemicflu.gov/ ) . On June 11 , 2009 WHO raise pandemic threat level 6 response global appearance new strain swine Influenza A ( subtype H1N1 ) . The rapidity H1N1 virus spread exemplifies notion quickly accurately identify viral pathogen associate outbreak critical global public health . In addition threat influenza outbreak , expansion number virus cause acute respiratory tract infection compound difficulty correctly rapidly identify primary pathogen ; new virus subtype increase complexity test . Molecular diagnostic assay ideally suit address complexity . Assays base polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) incorporate multiple primer probe ( e.g. , multiplexed ) single reaction deal complexity.4 Such assay extremely sensitive , high degree specificity , perform quickly . The artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test real-time PCR assay detection identification Influenza A B , QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel test nucleic acid amplification-based assay detection identification broad range common respiratory virus associate acute respiratory tract infection . In present study respiratory specimens prospectively collect test use artus Influenza A/B RT-PCR test QIAGEN ResPlex II Advanced Panel test .</detailed_description>
