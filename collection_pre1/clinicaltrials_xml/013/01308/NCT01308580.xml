	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To demonstrate non inferiority term overall survival ( OS ) Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² ( Arm A ) versus Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² ( Arm B ) combination prednisone participant metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) previously treat docetaxel-containing regimen . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate safety 2 treatment arm assess Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² well tolerate Cabazitaxel 25 mg/m² . - To compare efficacy Cabazitaxel 20 mg/m² 25 mg/m² : - Progression Free Survival ( PFS ) define first occurrence follow event : tumor progression per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) progression , pain progression death due cause ; - PSA Progression ; - Pain progression ; - Tumor response participant measurable disease ( RECIST 1.1 ) ; - PSA response ; - Pain response participant stable pain baseline . - To compare Health-related Quality Life ( HRQoL ) . - To assess pharmacokinetics pharmacogenomics Cabazitaxel .</brief_summary>
