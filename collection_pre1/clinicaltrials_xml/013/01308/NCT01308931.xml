	<detailed_description>Anti-mullerian hormone ( AMH ) show reliable marker ovarian reserve level demonstrate consistent age-related decline fluctuate throughout menstrual cycle . In prior study measure marker AMH , tubal ligation show adverse effect ovarian reserve . The primary aim study compare rate anti-mullerian hormone ( AMH ) decline follow tubal ligation , Essure placement , levonorgestrel IUDs , identify difference specific contraceptive method change AMH rate time . The secondary aim focus analyze various type tubal ligation method ( i.e . coagulation , ligation , clip , band , etc . ) see different technique result difference rate AMH decline . The hypothesis tubal ligation result accelerate rate AMH decline compare long-term permanent contraceptive method .</detailed_description>
