	<brief_summary>Flail chest refers section rib cage break away surround rib . Usually , one rib involve , break least two place . Flail chest typically result blunt chest trauma . As result flail chest , chest wall become unstable danger life threaten respiratory failure hypoxemia ( lack oxygen circulate blood lead organ damage failure ) occur . Currently , injury treat non operatively . However , small case series demonstrate operative management improve Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) length stay , improve pulmonary function decrease pain lead decrease duration mechanical ventilation , incidence complication related injury . This study hop provide information whether prospective randomize trial feasible first undertake small pilot study determine rate recruitment , data collection method , integrity study protocol . Null Hypothesis 1 : Enrollment subject flail chest rib fracture prospective multi-centre RCT feasible large clinical trial unlikely complete .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The optimum treatment flail chest rib fracture currently unknown . The standard care injury center North America , include progressive algorithm epidural anesthesia , mechanical ventilation , tracheostomy . Surgical management flail chest injuries previously reserve refractory case unable wean mechanical ventilation severe chest wall instability . However , use surgical stabilization multiple rib fracture demonstrate substantial improvement ICU length stay , duration mechanical ventilation , incidence pneumonia , tracheotomy , reintubation . These result report small case series without prospective randomize trial design .</detailed_description>
