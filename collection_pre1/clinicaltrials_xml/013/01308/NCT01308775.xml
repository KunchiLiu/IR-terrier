	<detailed_description>Over 200,000 woman diagnose breast cancer year 2006 . Many woman render free cancer , need ongoing disease specific care surveillance . The estimated number breast cancer survivor year 2003 2.3 million ( 1 ) . With outcome improve diagnosis early breast cancer , number breast cancer survivor follow care continue increase eventually result unmanageable load subspecialties medical surgical oncology . Most patient continue see oncology specialist least five year cancer diagnosis , type follow may necessary optimally utilized . Alternate Strategies Health Care Delivery Studies suggest oncology follow care costly health care system matter provider , case , diagnostic test overuse ( 2 ) . In randomized trial 296 woman history breast cancer Great Britain , transfer routine follow-up care family physician result increase time diagnosis recurrence ( 3 ) . Patient satisfaction great health service cost less , anxiety health relate quality life unaffected ( 4 , 5 ) . A similar multicenter trial 968 early-stage breast cancer patient Canada complete adjuvant treatment randomize patient follow cancer center family physician ( 6 ) . This study find statistically significant difference number recurrence , death , recurrence relate serious clinical event , patient report health-related quality life questionnaires group . While transfer oncology follow-up care back primary care physician seem reasonable alternative , shortage primary care physician certain region US around world , limit approach ( 7 , 8 ) . A study Sweden compare nurse-led follow-up vs. physician follow-up 264 consecutively select woman newly diagnose Stage I II breast cancer ( 9 ) . Outcomes included measure patient well-being , satisfaction , access medical care , medical safety . Questionnaires contain Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) , Satisfaction Accessibility ( SaaC ) scale obtain baseline twice year period 5 year . Number contact health care service , number diagnostic procedure , time recurrence death monitor . Ratings HADS SaaC scale show statistically significant difference follow-up group . The level anxiety depression generally low , level patient satisfaction high . There differences group concern time recurrence death suggest follow-up care experience nurse professional safe effective . Various strategy study evaluate alternative routine clinic visit referral subspecialists order improve access care lower health care cost . One study test hypothesis virtual outreach would reduce number contact health care system , reduce number medical test intervention , positive impact patient satisfaction . A randomized control trial conduct compare standard outpatient referral joint teleconsultations general practitioner ( GP ) , specialist , patient ( 10 ) . Patients randomize virtual outreach underwent joint teleconsultation , GP consult hospital specialist via videolink . In study , patient virtual outreach group likely schedule follow-up appointment , few test investigation order . In 6-month period follow initial consultation , significant difference number contact outpatient visit GP , inpatient stay , procedure , prescription randomize group . Patient satisfaction great virtual outreach consultation , patient enablement physical psychological score Short Form-12 , differ randomize group . Interestingly , health care cost 6 month great virtual outreach consultation conventional outpatient , overall cost , time , productivity saving patient identify . This study represent example technology utilized streamline care provide patient center service , service may save money overall health care system . The need assess cost-effectiveness patient outcome alternate surveillance follow strategy recently highlight review article Tolaney ( 11 ) . UCSF Dynamic Clinical Systems ( DCS ) Collaboration The UCSF Breast Care Center embark upon collaboration Dynamic Clinic Systems implement computer base , patient center system symptom reporting data collection improve clinical care patient generate database patient report symptoms outcome information research purpose . Dynamic Clinical Systems ( DCS ) provider real-time Web-based application focus patient-clinician interaction . The DCS approach enable patient provide health data electronically . Clinicians may use data research , medical documentation , registry depend type data collect consent patient . Through system , patient report health information via DCS web-based Integrated Survey System ( ISS ) . The process follow : A real-time interface download appointment hospital schedule system ISS . Survey group automatically schedule base pre-defined timing parameter . Prior send patient first survey , patient call welcome program ask use internet . If , give instruction completion survey home . If need assistance , give appointment come resource center work staff member complete survey . The patient notify ( via automatically-generated email ISS hospital letter/phone ) either sign take survey home come clinic early take survey . Once log , patient opportunity indicate online consent ( approved CHR ) share data research purpose . An analyst monitor progress survey completion call patient whose survey complete prior clinic appointment facilitate survey completion . At end process , patient summary report generate ISS display summary patient survey answer , longitudinal comparison previous survey , red flag warning , quality measure . The clinician us report clinic visit focus discussion highlight item . DCS service vendor build service online-questionnaire platform . All content questionnaire create review investigator UCSF ( exception standardize survey SF-36 validate questionnaire ) . Other , DCS role study , receive access information regard study outcome ( term patient visit intervention ) either arm study . We plan implement evaluate comprehensive survivorship program , support interactive web-based system report physical psychological symptom . The system capture structure data use drive translation research finding improve care survivor . The System Individualized survivorship care , base patient Self-reported data , review Nurse practitioner , target Education , Triage appropriate service improve symptom management outcomes call SIS.NET</detailed_description>
