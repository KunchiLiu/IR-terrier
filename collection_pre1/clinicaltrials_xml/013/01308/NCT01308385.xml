	<brief_summary>Despite enormous progress insufficient postoperative pain management remain frequent problem early postoperative phase surgery . Furthermore , pain persists heal surgical wound large , often unrecognized , clinical problem estimate 5-10 % undergoing surgery develop severe persistent pain lead chronic disability psychosocial distress . Conditioned Pain Modulation ( CPM ) , also know phenomenon `` pain-inhibits-pain '' , reduction pain somewhere body response application second painful stimulus outside painful area . In recent year , CPM identify psycho-physical measure clinical relevance characterize individual 's ability modulate pain consequently individual 's disposition acquire painful condition . The purpose study primarily assess relationship CPM efficacy clinical postoperative pain ( postoperative pain intensity , use analgesic , intensity secondary hyperalgesia allodynia , incidence persistent postoperative pain ) associate minimally invasive repair pectus excavatum . In addition , study aim identify patient- and/or surgery-related factor affect course postoperative pain . Hypothesis : - The great positive difference experimental pressure pain threshold ( kPa ) measure application second painful stimulus ( Cold Pressor Test ) , low risk develop persistent postoperative pain . Secondary hypothesis - The great positive difference experimental pressure pain threshold ( kPa ) measure application different experimental painful stimulus ( Cold Pressor Test ) low pain intensity early postoperative period . - The great positive difference experimental pressure pain threshold ( kPa ) measure application different experimental painful stimulus ( Cold Pressor Test ) , short duration early postoperative pain . - The great positive difference experimental pressure pain threshold ( kPa ) measure application different experimental painful stimulus ( Cold Pressor Test ) , low usage epidural analgesia ( mg / ml ) . - The large positive difference experimental pressure pain threshold ( kPa ) measure application different experimental painful stimulus ( Cold Pressor Test ) low consumption oral analgesic ( mg / day ) . - Severe acute pain early postoperative period ( postoperative day 0-3 ) positively associate development persistent postoperative pain ( 6 month postoperatively ) . - Presence preoperative pain / high postoperative use analgesic / high pain intensity first 6-8 week postoperatively predict pain 6 month postoperatively . - The high pain intensity discomfort associate brush-evoked allodynia / pinprick ( Von Frey ) secondary hyperalgesia great risk develop persistent postoperative pain ( 6 month postoperatively ) . - High level preoperative catastrophizing ( assessed day admission ) relate severity acute pain ( rat third postoperative day ) chronic pain ( assessed 6 month postoperatively ) , even control depression anxiety . - The degree preoperative positive negative emotion ( assessed day admission ) relate degree acute pain ( rat third postoperative day ) chronic pain ( assessed 6 month postoperatively ) negative emotion associate high level pain , positive feeling relate low level pain . - The study population differ significantly normal population term personality trait ( emotional reaction , extraversion , openness experience , friendliness , conscientiousness ) . - The study population experience significant change personality trait first 6 month surgery . - The quality life self-esteem low among patient develop persistent postoperative pain compare pain patient . - Quality life self-esteem improve result minimally invasive repair pectus excavatum .</brief_summary>
