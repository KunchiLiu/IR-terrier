	<brief_summary>This placebo control randomised clinical trial.Patients attend Yorkshire Early Arthritis Clinics diagnose rheumatoid arthritis symptom duration 3−12 month recruit . They randomise blind therapy either methotrexate intravenous corticosteroid baseline , methotrexate intravenous infliximab accord standard treatment regime . Patients follow regularly , visit , patient remission , give intramuscular injection corticosteroid . After 26 week , patient unblinded inadequate treatment response treat accord dose escalation algorithm achieve remission . Those remission continue blind therapy 6 month remission achieve intravenous agent ( infliximab placebo ) withdrawn .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main aim study compare efficacy biologic therapy ( infliximab ) induction therapy current best practice therapy : early introduction methotrexate combination steroid induction therapy dose modification accord predefined disease activity measure ( informed literature , base around pragmatic dose escalation protocol ) . Exploratory analysis image finding undertaken subgroup patient sit able perform assessment . The image technique use include 1 . DEXA 2 . US 3 . Peripheral MRI End point The end point study define : - Completion 78 week therapy study - Withdrawal due reason include toxicity inefficacy - Withdrawal due completion dose escalation regime disease remain active - Withdrawal due meeting NICE criterion biologics dose escalation regime At end study , patient continue follow Yorkshire Rheumatology clinic part routine care .
