	<brief_summary>Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 ( FGF23 ) molecule implicate homeostasis phosphorus . Elevated FGF23 level well-documented patient CKD inversely correlate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( GFR ) . FGF23 level also predictive progression CKD predict mortality CKD . Although study normal individual suggest phosphorus intake relate FGF23 level , effect dietary pharmacologic phosphate restriction FGF23 level patient CKD never report . Our objective determine phosphate reduction use non-calcium base phosphate binder decrease serum FGF23 level . The investigator also investigate association elevation FGF 23 level commonly encounter co-morbidities CKD patient Coronary Artery Disease , Diabetes Mellitus , Hypertension .</brief_summary>
