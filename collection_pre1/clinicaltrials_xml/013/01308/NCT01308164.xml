	<brief_summary>The objective feasibility study evaluate efficacy safety automate determined Insulin pump setting ( i.e. , basal plan , correction factor , carbohydrate ration insulin activity time ) use MD-Logic Pump Advisor individual type 1 diabetes . Study design : Prospective study two segment : ( ) Pilot study , 30 day trial evaluate MD-Logic pump advisor ( ii ) , randomize control trial ( RCT ) , 30-78 day trial compare MD-Logic pump advisor standard care patient type 1 diabetes . The RCT initiate pilot segment ( include data analysis ) . The pilot segment include 15-30 pediatric patient . In RCT , 105 ( 50 minor protocol 55 adult separate protocol ) eligible subject enrol allow 92 valuable subject end study . The subject population randomly assign 1:1 either intervention group control group . At pediatric sub study approximately 50 patient participate separate Adults study additional 55 adult patient participate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MD-Logic Pump Advisor design Diabetes Technology Center , Institute Endocrinology Diabetes , National Center Childhood Diabetes , Schneider Children 's Medical Center Israel . The MD-Logic Pump Advisor learn adapts patient 's insulin pump setting order optimize glucose control . The MD-Logic Pump Advisor need , input , sensor reading , insulin delivery record meal home care . During collection data , patient ask continue daily routine ( need special consideration ) . The present study design test automatic algorithm evaluate change , necessary , patient 's insulin pump setting base prior sensor reading , insulin delivery , meal data collect patient regular treatment home . The objective feasibility study evaluate efficacy safety automate determined Insulin pump setting ( i.e. , basal plan , correction factor , carbohydrate ration insulin activity time ) use MD-Logic Pump Advisor individual type 1 diabetes . Study design : Prospective study two segment : ( ) Pilot study , 30-78 day trial evaluate MD-Logic pump advisor ( ii ) , randomize control trial ( RCT ) , 30-78 day trial compare MD-Logic pump advisor standard care patient type 1 diabetes .
