	<brief_summary>Asthma affect 6 % UK population cost NHS 1 billion pound per year . £473 million alone spent inhaled steroid treatment design reduce inflammation breathe tube . Unfortunately know whether patient right amount steroid treatment difficult , asthma variable disease measure currently use decide increase decrease steroid treatment bare little resemblance actual amount inflammation present . Doctors may reduce treatment swiftly necessary patient 's asthma well control concern asthma attack ; result potential treatment inhaled steroid . Although steroid treatment safe , side effect occur , cost large , strategy help avoid treatment would beneficial patient NHS . As investigator accurately measure airway inflammation present breathing tube , use chemical call nitric oxide present patient 's breath , investigator might able accurately predict patient could safely reduce steroid treatment . Measuring nitric oxide simple , involve breathe special machine ( similar roadside breathalyser ) . In study investigator measure nitric oxide patient well control asthma , reduce asthma treatment 50 % . The investigator follow patient remeasure nitric oxide . At end study investigator see measurement nitric oxide predict patient could safely step treatment . If successful could help reduce overall cost NHS inhale steroid reduce steroid associate side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting Steroid Response Using Exhaled Nitric Oxide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal objective establish whether baseline measurement airway inflammation , measure exhale breath , variation measurement time , predict patient safely step asthma treatment without experience loss asthma control . This study design show whether policy utilise measurement exhale nitric oxide ( present breath ) guide asthma treatment feasible , worth test future prospective study . The secondary objective establish approach feasible , safe cost effective , compare current clinical guideline . Asthma define presence symptom associate variable airflow obstruction , airway inflammation airway hyperresponsiveness . Inhaled corticosteroid one commonly use treatment asthma , currently £473 million per year spend medication alone UK . Guidelines recommend treatment decision base assessment symptom airflow obstruction . However , clear relationship symptom control , airflow obstruction airway inflammation , risk patient treat . In U.K. 80 % patient asthma manage primary care ; assessment airway inflammation applicable setting , management relies assessment peak flow symptom . Recently concentration nitric oxide present exhale breath ( FENO ) evaluate tool assess asthma . FENO elevate patient asthma , reduce treatment inhaled corticosteroid ( 8 ) correlate airway inflammation measure use bronchial biopsy induce sputum . It particularly applicable monitoring asthma primary care test easy perform , provide immediate result , inexpensive portable monitor available . FENO appear specific , sensitive , marker airway inflammation use low level FENO predict lack treatable airway inflammation may successful . Evidence study child suggest strategy may successful . However , study use FENO guide ICS dose adopt approach instead randomise controlled trial use step up/ protocol whereby high FENO lead step ICS dose , low FENO lead step dose . They attempt reduce asthma exacerbation despite also try reduce steroid dose . These study meet primary endpoint review Cochrane report . In study Shaw et al . similar amount ICS use duration study group manage FENO control group ; however difference end study , FENO group use significantly less ICS . In study Smith et al . daily dose ICS significantly low time point , however study result applicable patient receive long act β2 agonist , ICS dose control group artificially inflate . These trial lend weight idea utilise step approach FENO ICS may successful . Importantly significant difference asthma exacerbation rate control treatment group either study , suggest approach utilise FENO inherently safe . Other study support supposition ; one study suggest close correlation loss asthma control ICS reduction , another study demonstrate within 2 week reduction ICS , FENO rise back baseline , however exact cut value simple step strategy never seek , despite evidence would constitute best approach . Most patient step 2-3 asthma guideline , receive ICS dose 200-800mcgs , manage primary care ; guideline 50 % reduction ICS 3 month base sparse evidence . If low FENO identify patient step ICS treatment without risk worsen asthma , strategy use FENO likely adopt current guideline .</detailed_description>
