	<brief_title>Fish Oil Muscle Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Loss muscle mass normal consequence age many old adult , worsen chronic illness , poor appetite diet , reduce physical activity . The ensue decline physical function major cause frailty , disability death . Treatments reverse reduce age-associated loss muscle mass therefore much need . Evidence emerge consumption fish fish oil derive long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCn-3PUFA ) may important maintenance muscle mass physical function throughout life-span . However , effect LCn-3PUFA supplementation muscle mass , muscle strength overall physical function know . The goal study therefore determine effect LCn-3PUFA supplementation muscle mass , muscle strength physical function older adult .</detailed_description>
