	<brief_title>Pain Relieving Efficacy TAP Block Patients After Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity surgery expensive , although highly competitive cost obesity relate disease . An important step would reorganize obesity surgery day surgical procedure . Some report already exist literature number publication sparse , description condition patient limit . Our primary aim , therefore , investigate influence transverses abdominis plane block pain laparoscopic gastric bypass . The benefit adequate postoperative analgesia clear , include reduction postoperative stress response , reduction postoperative morbidity certain type surgery , improved surgical outcome . The benefit utilizing regional analgesic technique compare systemic analgesic include reduction pain intensity , decrease incidence side effect systemic analgesic improve patient comfort . Effective pain control thereby accelerate recovery surgery . A substantial component pain experience patient abdominal surgery derive abdominal wall incision . The Transversus Abdominis Plane ( TAP ) Block first describe 2001 letter Dr. Rafi . McDonnell et al develop tested block describes landmark technique . TAP Block involve block sensory afferent nerve supply anterior abdominal wall include skin , muscle parietal peritoneum . Hebbard et al subsequently describe ultrasound guide technique TAP block name Posterior TAP block . The posterior TAP block provide analgesia lower abdominal wall . Hebbard also describe another ultrasound-guided technique call Oblique Sub costal TAP block provide analgesia surgery upper abdominal wall . There debate extent sensory blockade achieve TAP block . Nerves supply anterior abdominal wall derive T16 L1 pas plane supply anterior abdominal wall . Earlier study show T7-L1 spread block single posterior TAP injection , new study reveal block fail spread T10 suitable low abdominal procedure . In contrast oblique sub costal TAP block provide effective analgesia surgery involve dermatome T6 T10 , word provide analgesia surgery upper abdominal wall . Studies look posterior TAP block demonstrate reduced postoperative morphine consumption improve pain score rest movement patient undergo low midline laparotomy , open appendectomy , laparoscopic appendectomy total abdominal hysterectomy , caesarean section laparoscopic cholecystectomy . The duration morphine-sparing effect single shot injection posterior TAP report range 12 48 hour . Pain score rest movement reduce compare placebo 48 hour surgery . Single shot TAP block also use provide analgesia patient admit ICU analgesia provide block last 16 24 hour . There report Leicester General Hospital effectiveness insert catheter oblique sub costal TAP . The obtained block provide analgesia 72 hour patient surgery upper abdominal wall ( hepatobiliary surgery ) . They also describe block effective rescue analgesia patient epidural ineffective . Currently knowledge clinical trial analgesic efficacy single shot oblique sub costal TAP block surgery upper abdominal wall . Niraj et al report observe duration postoperative analgesia 6 8 hour single shot sub costal TAP . While Patil et al report sensory blockade 5 hour along dermatomal level T7-L1 single shot posterior TAP block combine sub costal TAP block . Oblique sub costal TAP block could viable alternative provide analgesia postoperative period . The block perform easily use ultrasound guidance , excellent safety profile , provide effective dynamic analgesia significant morphine-sparing effect . The propose study involve utilization ultrasound locate oblique subcostal TAP , injection bupivacaine placebo ( saline ) TAP side comparison analgesic efficacy TAP injection placebo two week patient gastric bypass .</detailed_description>
