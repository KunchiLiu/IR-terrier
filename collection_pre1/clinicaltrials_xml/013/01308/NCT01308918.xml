	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Anesthesia thoracic surgery ( non cardiac ) often require pulmonary isolation technique order facilitate surgery , protect healthy lung , control ventilation . The double lumen tube ( DLT ) , right left version , technique choice obtain lung isolation , whereas bronchial blocker also use . Double-lumen tube One-lung ventilation require thoracic surgery . Many strategy use achieve lung isolation : 1 ) use endobronchial tube , 2 ) use single-lumen tube ( SLT ) bronchial blocker ( BB ) , 3 ) use double-lumen tube ( DLT ) . There many advantage use DLT : easy position , short time lung collapse re-expansion BB , lung suctioned/ventilated separately , less subject displacement BB . Since medical instrument perfect , DLT also inconvenient : DLT large , less compliant SLT . They also two cuff , one bronchial another one tracheal . The latter causing problem intubate patient teeth superior jaw . Precautions take avoid rupture tracheal cuff . These characteristic exaggerate anesthesiologist face patient difficult airway . These case usually manage first proceed standard intubation SLT , second , use airway exchange catheter ( AEC ) withdraw SLT , , advance DLT proper position . Thereafter , gold standard confirm DLT position fiberoptic bronchoscope ( FOB ) . If direct laryngoscopy provide poor glottis visualization , another option proceed FOB-assisted DLT intubation . Video laryngoscopes Over last decade , video laryngoscope develop handle difficult airway management . They advantage improve Cormack-Lehane ( CL ) grade direct laryncoscopy . Many manufacturer distribute video laryngoscope : Storz® C-MAC™ , McGrath® Series-5™ , GlideScope® Video Laryngoscope™ ( GVL ) examples . This latter frequently use centre allow tracheal intubation SLT numerous situation conventional laryngoscopy possible . The GVL require technique direct laryngoscopy without line sight , turn CL Grade III IV CL Grade I II . Stylet To facilitate endotracheal tube ( ETT ) insertion use GVL , either semi-rigid malleable stylet must use . There also lot discussion best stylet configuration allow tip ETT position glottis open advance tube trachea , consensus obtain yet . Difficult airway management may optimize shape SLT use malleable stylet , direct ETT vocal cord . The main problem malleable stylet lose initial shape ETT go narrow airway . It many clinician prefer semi-rigid stylet use GlideScope® . Double-lumen tube already supply malleable aluminum stylet order maintain initial shape , author find accuracy placement improve retain left-DLT entire intubation procedure . New semi-rigid stylet Video laryngoscope design mostly use SLT , recent publication suggest use GlideScope® primary DLT placement difficult airway , describe Hernandez , A et al . 2005 Chen , A et al . 2008 . Even DLT provide stylet , technique intubation GVL remain difficult , mainly aluminum stylet malleable . Verathon Inc. market GlideRite® rigid stylet , especially design use GlideScope® . Its length fit SLT , shape adapt GVL 's curvature , curvature modify accommodate difficult airway intentional movement . In collaboration Verathon Inc. , design new semi-rigid intubating stylet use primary DLT intubation Glidescope® Videolaryngoscope , GlideRite DLT Stylet® . This improved intubating tool share curve long GlideRite® rigid stylet . It present specific handle fit DLT orient distal extremity right leave bronchus . The new stylet fit 35 41 French , leave right-sided DLTs . Anticipated benefit new design short time require position DLT , less intubating attempt , low risk trauma airway , low risk desaturation , low risk tracheal cuff ' rupture , result one-step lung isolation . HYPOTHESIS We believe , video laryngoscopy , use semi-rigid GlideRite DLT Stylet® primary insertion DLT possible . The gain rigidity develop GlideRite DLT Stylet® impose shape DLT , conserve tube guide superior airway . We hope combination GlideScope® new semi-rigid stylet increase number successful primary intubation double lumen tube . Furthermore , utilization could drastically decrease associated risk blind DLT intubation AEC . These risk oxygen desaturation , pulmonary aspiration , superior airway trauma . OBJECTIVES The primary objective observational study determine GlideRite DLT Stylet® efficiency endotracheal intubation double lumen tube video laryngoscopy ( GlideScope® ) . The secondary objective : 1 . To time intubate process . 2 . To count number attempt obtain successful intubation . 3 . To verify correlation difficult intubation score successful intubation . 4 . To note complication associate GlideRite DLT Stylet® utilization . METHODS After obtain local REB approval , 50 patient thoracic surgery ( non cardiac ) via either thoracoscopy thoracostomy , enrol observational study May 14th 2010 January 17th 2011 . Intraoperative proceeding Before anesthesia induce , patient pre-oxygenated order obtain inspired-expired O2 gradient ≤10 % . Anesthesia perform conformity local practice standard . Curarization achieve inject dose ≥1.0 mg/kg ( ideal body weight ) rocuronium ( Zémuron® , Merck &amp; Co. , Whitehouse Station , NJ , USA ) . If mask ventilation proven difficult , patient exclude study . The malleable stylet remove DLT ( Broncho-Cath R- L-DLT , 35 41Fr , Mallinckrodt Inc , St-Louis , MO , USA ) replace GlideRite DLT Stylet® ( Verathon Medical ULC , Burnaby , BC , Canada ) . Before proceed intubation , curarization level verify neuromuscular stimulator , absence thumb movement train-of-four apply allow u begin protocol . The timer start either GlideScope® blade ( Verathon Medical ULC , Burnaby , BC , Canada ) insert lip stop tracheal cuff pass vocal cord . In case patient present upper teeth , timer start DLT insert lip . Immediately intubation , intratracheal position confirm FOB . When patient teeth superior jaw , DLT insert first mouth order avoid rupture tracheal cuff . External larynx manipulation allow time . If one ( 1 ) minute , intubation successful , anesthesiologist could modify stylet shape . If two ( 2 ) minute , intubation still achieve , DLT GVL blade withdrawn , mask ventilation start . At time , anesthesiologist could use intubation technique choice . The position DLT confirm visualization trachea FOB . Throughout process , oxygen saturation drop 94 % , mask ventilation start increase saturation 98 % another intubation could attempt . If oxygen saturation drop 90 % , mask ventilation start increase saturation 98 % , patient exclude study , anesthesiologist could use intubation technique choice . Statistical analysis Data obtain preoperative period correlate success rate , time achieve successful intubation , number attempt .</detailed_description>
