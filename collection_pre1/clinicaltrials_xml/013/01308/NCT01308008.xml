	<detailed_description>The goal propose research test whether long-term exercise program sedentary Veterans diabetes produce sustain improvement mobility performance physical activity . To facilitate adherence long-term program , investigator plan individualize , home exercise/physical activity ( PA ) enhancement program behavioral support . The rationale program base : 1 ) feasibility previously fund VA RR &amp; D control trial ( lead present research team ) sedentary old adult diabetes improved mobility performance , specifically usual gait speed ; 2 ) need long term functionally-relevant intervention ( specifically mobility-oriented ) old adult diabetic ; 3 ) potential use telephonic nurse support assist overcome barrier exercise deal intercurrent illness , factor key comorbid patient group ; 4 ) potential increase focus objectively measure physical activity . In proposed research , 240 sedentary old adult diabetic ( age 60 ) randomly allocate customize , primarily home-based , functionally-oriented exercise program nurse support intervention ( I ) group versus flexibility tone , health education control ( C ) group , test outcome functional mobility physical activity 4 week , 6 month one year .</detailed_description>
