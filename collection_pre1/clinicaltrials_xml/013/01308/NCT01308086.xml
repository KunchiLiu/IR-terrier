	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare whether 3-month treatment least inferior 6-month treatment ( FOLFOX-4 6 vs. 12 cycle XELOX 4 cycle vs. 8 cycle ) term RFS patient high risk stage II stage III radically resect colon cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adjuvant Therapy ( 3 vs. 6 Months ) With FOLFOX 4 XELOX Stage II Stage III Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Six month adjuvant chemotherapy 5-FU oxaliplatin patient stage III colon cancer world-wide standard care , base MOSAIC C-07 trial . However , lead significant cost , toxicity , inconvenience . In particular , onset oxaliplatin induce cumulative dose-dependent neuropathy significant issue . The ability maintain efficacy reduce duration therapy would clear advantage patient , provider , health care system . Multiple large trial 1990s demonstrate previous standard 12 month therapy could reduce 6 month . A single small trial 5-FU alone demonstrate similar outcome 3 versus 6 month therapy . Thus , propose definitively evaluate non-inferiority 3 month oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy versus current standard 6 month . The primary endpoint disease-free survival ( DFS ) . It essential sufficient power eliminate possibility clinically meaningful inferiority 3 month therapy : huge number patient necessary . Previous effort experience conclusively demonstrate colon cancer , single , global trial impractical . Consequently , international , prospective pool analysis perform , gather data independent trial run different country , answer single primary hypothesis 3 month adjuvant therapy FOLFOX/XELOX non-inferior current standard 6 month . Among six planned country , Greek intergroup conduct one trial .</detailed_description>
