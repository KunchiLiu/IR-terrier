	<brief_title>Influence Varenicline Antiplatelet Action Clopidogrel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Smoking major risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Compared nonsmoker , smoker approximately twice likely develop CVD , three time likely die . This increase risk due deleterious effect smoke endothelial function blood coagulation , development coronary atherosclerotic plaque . A research show continued smoke successful percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) associate increase risk restenosis . However , smoke cessation make 36 % reduction crude relative risk ( RR ) mortality patient CVD . Hence current management guideline advocate smoke cessation , addition control hypertension dyslipidemia , part overall cardiovascular risk reduction strategy . Varenicline novel selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor partial agonist approve 70 country worldwide aid smoke cessation . Clopidogrel widely use patient coronary artery disease undergo PCI . The relationship smoke cardiovascular disease increase prospect patient receive smoke cessation therapy Clopidogrel concomitantly clinical practice . Plasma protein bind Varenicline low ( â‰¤20 % ) independent age renal function . The major route clearance varenicline renal excretion . Clopidogrel , prodrug , metabolize 2 consecutive cytochrome P450-dependent step active metabolite , bind irreversibly platelet P2Y12 receptor . The likelihood clinically relevant drug-drug interaction varenicline Clopidogrel consider low ; nevertheless , possibility interaction 2 drug lack clinical evidence . Hence , hypothesis varenicline may influence antiplatelet action clopidogrel .</detailed_description>
