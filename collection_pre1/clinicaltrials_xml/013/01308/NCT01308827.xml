	<brief_summary>Streptococcus pneumoniae major cause pneumonia , sepsis , bacteremia pneumococcal meningitis among infant child worldwide . Knowledge epidemiology pneumococcal disease essential assess potential usefulness pneumococcal disease usefulness pneumococcal conjugate immunization . There paucity information regard pneumococcal disease burden child Latin America . Most study base passive microbiology laboratory surveillance capture invasive disease , thus underestimate true disease burden . Data active surveillance available specific region Costa Rica , introduction universal vaccination PCV-7 . On January 2009 , PCV-7 introduce universal vaccination program child bear September 2008 use 3+1 regimen therefore possibility analyze benefit introduction vaccine universal immunization program . The effectiveness data Latin America publish Uruguay significant decline incidence pneumonia meningitis observe following introduction PCV-7 . This associated increment serotypes 19A , 1,5 7F . Uruguay modify PCV-7 PCV-13 . In Costa Rica August 2011 , PCV-7 change PCV 13 . This study provide information regard impact PCV-7 PCV-13 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Objective ( ) : Primary Objectives : 1 . Determine population-based incidence invasive pneumococcal disease ( IPD ) define isolation S. pneumoniae normally sterile site child 28 day 36 month age sign symptom disease 2 . Describe serotype distribution invasive S. pneumoniae isolate 3 . Compare incidence serotype distribution S. pneumoniae infection study population universal introduction heptavalent conjugate vaccine S. pneumoniae . Secondary Objectives : 1 . Describe antibiotic resistance rate invasive S. pneumoniae isolate 2 . Describe serotype distribution resistant S. pneumoniae isolate 3 . Assess neurologic sequelae pneumococcal meningitis 4 . Describe bacteriology S. pneumoniae Study Design : A prospective , population-based epidemiologic study Costa Rica include child 28 day 36 month age presenting refer participant healthcare center temperature &gt; equal 39.0 Celcius and/or clinical suspicion pneumonia , meningitis , sepsis invasive pneumococcal disease regardless temperature . Children meet study entry criterion offer enrollment study . Informed consent obtain . Data collect upon enrollment include : date birth , race , sex , enrollment diagnosis , history receipt pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( PCV ) and/or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine , residence , absence/presence factor know associated IPD : antibiotic use previous 7 day , daycare attendance , smoker household , &gt; equal 5 individual household presence underlie medical illness chronic condition : sickle cell disease hemoglobinopathy , prematurity , HIV , immunodeficiency , reactive airway disease , systemic steroid use , neoplastic disease , pulmonary condition , renal condition , cardiac condition , hematologic condition and/or diabetes . One blood culture collect upon enrollment , antibiotic administration clinically possible . Specimens fro sterile sit i.e , pleural fluid , CSF joint fluid , collect per routine medical practice . All bacteriology sample undergo bacterial culture local laboratory identification pathogen , accord standard methodology . Bacterial isolates S. pneumoniae identify accord establish standard microbiologic procedure . All bacterial isolates store per laboratory protocol future microbiologic investigation . All S. pneumoniae isolates subcultured sent transport medium central laboratory confirmation identification , serotyping antimicrobial susceptibility test . Serotyping perform use type specific serum Quellung reaction . Results culture document subject . Final diagnosis vital status collect day 10 hospital discharge , whichever occur first , hospitalized subject , subject whose culture ( ) yield S. pneumoniae , and/or subject whose inclusion criterion include clinical suspicion meningitis.For subject suspect pneumonia , result chest radiograph perform part normal standard care take 72 hour prior post study enrollment record normal abnormal , abnormal , presence lobar consolidation , pleural effusion , document . The investigator use World Health Organization ( WHO ) guideline ( Standardization interpretation chest radiograph diagnosis pneumonia child , World Health Organization Pneumonia Vaccine Trial Investigators'Group ) document radiograph report subject 's case report form . For subject enrol suspected meningitis , final diagnosis document . If meningitis final diagnosis record follow : - Definite pneumococcal meningitis : Isolation S. pneumoniae CSF , blood culture subject &gt; 10 white blood cell ( WBCs ) /μL examination CSF either CSF protein &gt; 100 mg/dL CSF glucose &lt; 40 mg/dL glucose CSF-to-serum ratio less 0.6 . - Probable pneumococcal meningitis : CSF &gt; 10 WBCs/μL either evidence suggestive pneumococcal infection , Gram stain CSF gram-positive cocci positive latex agglutination S. pneumoniae CSF non culture technique ; isolation S. pneumoniae blood subject admit suspected meningitis lack CSF characteristic definite pneumococcal meningitis , CSF obtain . - Meningitis pneumococcal : Evidence meningitis ( &gt; 10 WBCs/μL examination CSF either CSF protein &gt; 100 mg/dL CSF glucose &lt; 40 mg/dL glucose CSF-to-serum ratio less 0.6 ) isolation another pathogen ( S. pneumoniae ) CSF blood sterile culture . For subset subject identify probable definite pneumococcal meningitis , neurologic examination conduct qualified physician evaluation neurologic sequelae 6 9 month enrollment ass subject neurologic deficit secondary meningitis . Abnormalities may include , limited : vegetative state , mental retardation , brain damage , hydrocephalus , cerebral palsy , hear impairment , vision impairment , seizure , development delay . In participant subject , possible , remnant sterile fluid ( example : CSF , joint , peritoneal , pleural fluid sterile fluid ) collect store -70C future test design identification S. pneumoniae . Duration Study : This study complete approximately 09 month possibility extend trial another year . Enrollment last 09 month . Number Subjects : Approximately 4000 child age 28 day 36 month enrol study period . Diagnosis Main Criteria Inclusion : 1 . Children 28 day 36 month age 2 . Presenting refer participate healthcare facility measure temperature ≥39.0 °C within 24 hour prior screen , clinical suspicion pneumonia , meningitis , sepsis , invasive pneumococcal disease , regardless temperature 3 . Subject belongs country specific target population study 4 . Informed consent obtain parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) Main Criteria Exclusion : 1 . Children young 28 day old 36 month age enrollment 2 . Children suspect dengue fever determine local standard care ( i.e. , platelet count , tourniquet test ) Safety Evaluation : 1 . Subjects observe 15 minute blood culture obtain determination protocol-related adverse effect . 2 . Protocol-related adverse event protocol relate serious adverse event occur within 1 day blood collection report base local legislation adverse event reporting . Statistical Analysis : The primary analysis annual age-specific incidence rate IPD estimate base number identify case study site size population risk child age 28 day 36 month area . Ninety-five percent ( 95 % ) confidence interval calculate base assumption Poisson distribution . Descriptive analysis serotype distribution IPD individual S. pneumoniae infection , well antimicrobial-resistant isolates perform . Summary data also analyze assess effect age demographic well risk factor ( describe in-study-design ) IPD incidence pneumococcal serotype distribution . Pooled analysis may perform . Rationale Number Subjects : Based publish study conduct Latin America , incidence IPD child less 5 year age vary widely ( 2.92/100,000 129/100,000 ) . Based first ear analysis protocol 0887XI-900 ( april 20 , 2007 - april 19 , 2008 ) document incidence IPD study area 40.0 per 100,000 child age 28 day less 36 month peak incidence 106.6/100,000 child age 28 day less 6 month age . Furthermore , period incidence chest radiograph confirm pneumonia 412.8 per 100,000 child age 28 day less 36 month peak incidence 744/100.000 child less 12 month age . During period S. pneumoniae isolates obtain : 14 ( 3 ) , 6A ( 2 ) one following : 3 , 4 , 6B , 7C , 9V 15B , 22F , 23 F. Because study design represent continuation similar study area , intervention universal application conjugate heptavalent vaccine newborn use 3 + 1 regimen , expect , one year universal vaccination , decline approximately 20 % number chest radiograph confirm pneumonia , 20 % decline overall incidence IPD 40 % reduction incidence IPD produce vaccine type S. pneumoniae isolates . Ethical Considerations : This study conduct accordance applicable Costa Rican law regulation include , limited , International Conference Harmonisation Guideline Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) ethical principle origins Declaration Helsinki . The institutional review board ( IRB ) /independent ethic committee ( IEC ) must review approve protocol informed consent form ( ICF ) subject enrol . The subject 's parent ( ) legal guardian ( ) must complete informed consent process use approve ICF procedure specify protocol performed .</detailed_description>
