	<detailed_description>General Purpose To evaluate effectiveness reduce pain improve function quality life 6-months follow-up therapeutic exercise program compare pharmacological treatment NSAIDs patient subacute low back pain attend physiatrist consultation several ambulatory health center Medellín year 2009-2010 . Specific Objectives 1 . To evaluate efficacy protocolized exercise program reducing low back pain . 2 . To evaluate efficacy protocolized exercise program improving function . 3 . To compare effect intervention quality life work absenteeism two group patient . 4 . To compare safety intervention . 5 . To estimate adherence cause non-adherence patient different treatment propose . 6 . To compare group number relapse , general specialize medical consultation , screen study , image treatment associate low back pain . Null Hypothesis Management subacute low back pain patient protocolized exercise program effective treatment NSAIDs reduce pain least 25 mm , measure Visual Analog Scale 0-100 mm . Alternative hypothesis Management subacute low back pain patient protocolized exercise program effective treatment NSAIDs reduce pain least 25 mm , measure Visual Analog Scale 0-100 mm . Methodology : Type study : randomize control clinical trial , single-blinded independent evaluator . Reference population : Patients consult physiatrists different physical medicine rehabilitation department Medellin , Colombia . Study population : patient subacute low back pain -evolution time 6 week less 3 months- , without radiculopathy , fulfill inclusion criterion . In addition patient must sign informed consent participate research . Inclusion criterion : - Patients age 18 60 year subacute low back pain . - Evolution time 6 week less 3 month . - That include social security system live metropolitan area . Exclusion criterion : - Antecedents spinal , pelvis abdominal trauma . - Cancer . - Diabetes mellitus . - Steroid use . - Women 60 year . - Cauda equine syndrome . - Men osteoporosis compression fracture . - Suspicion infection - Insidious onset - Constitutional symptom - Intravenous drug abuse - HIV - Immunosuppression - Previous surgery - Rheumatic disease - Urinary tract infection - Neurological symptom low limb - Mental illness ( schizophrenia , bipolar somatomorphic disorder , major depression ) - Deformities spine ( scoliosis great 15º ) - History peptic acid disease - Renal failure - Intake anticoagulant antiplatelet drug - Allergy NSAIDs . Primary outcome Pain relief 25 mm Visual Analogue Scale , range 0 100 , assess 4 week intervention . Secondary outcome : Improvement function assess Oswestry Disability Index Roland-Morris questionnaire compare baseline first , three six month follow-up . Improvement quality life assess SF-36 ( The Short Form Health Survey ) questionnaire baseline first , third sixth month . Work absenteeism decrease . Decrease number relapse , general specialize medical consultation , screen study , image treatment associate low back pain 6 month . Safety treatment evaluate exercise group tolerance train presence side effect , NSAIDs group presence absence adverse reaction . Sample : Sampling type : simple random . Sample size calculation base software `` Sample size Javeriana University '' Type I error : 0.05 Type II Error : 0.2 Assessments number prior randomization : 1 Assessments number randomization : 3 Correlation evaluation : 0.8 Clinically important difference : 0.33 Number patient per group : 33 Experimental group control group ratio : 1 1 10 % loss : 7 Total : 73 Randomization Randomization do mean permute block size 2 , 4 6 , generate computer ( Ralloc program , co Stata 8.2 , College Station , TX , USA ) . Allocation confidential open investigation complete , monitor Committee Data Security . Enrollment Patients subacute low back pain consulting Physical Medicine Rehabilitation Departments hospital Medellín , Colombia . There initial assessment , patient consider eligible invited participate ask sign inform consent ( Appendix 1 ) . Treatment assignment give opaque envelope . Masking Medical researcher evaluate patient , research assistant perform application different measure instrument statistical blind treatment allocation . Initial assessment Clinical evaluation perform one research physiatrists . Evaluation include : epidemiological clinical , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , Oswestry scale , Rolland Morris Scale , SF-36 quality life scale . Intervention One group assign protocolized back pain exercise , three time week 4 week . This program carry physiotherapist participate institution wish participate research give train standardize intervention program Exercise program include : physical agent , massage myofascial point , stretch strengthen exercise , cycloergometer band aerobic exercise . Treatment , type exercise , exercise tolerance adverse reaction register . The second group receive NSAID 10 day , two different option ( naproxen celecoxib ) accord indication contraindication . In case increase pain intensity either two group , acetaminophen dose 1.5 2.0 g / day use rescue . Adherence different treatment . To ensure adherence different treatment patient receive phone call weekly inquire assistance , difficulty , tolerance , use medication , adverse effect . Patients give questionnaire verify drug intake , dosage , time side effect . They also register drug ingestion . Telephone call make every 15 day ask health status ensure assistance new assessment . Assessment schedule 1 , 3 , 6 month Clinical evaluation perform one researcher physiatrists postgraduate student . Committee safety quality data . This committee consist two researcher one professional information management responsible database . This do Access SPSS 15 ( Statistical Product Service Solutions ) start information recollection . Analysis Plan Categorical univariate variable analyze frequency distribution quantitative variable measure central tendency ( mean , standard deviation , median range ) . Both group compare randomization intervention variable . Initially , establish group quantitative variable normal distribution , use Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Pain ( primary outcome ) evaluate patient 1 , 3 6 month compare initial pain ( mean confidence interval ) use Student test Mann Whitney time period . The procedure would outcomes measure quantitatively . An analysis variance repeat measure variability group intragroup make . Comparison categorical variable assessment do use Chi2 test . The level statistical significance use case 0.05 . An analysis intention treat per protocol make . Ethics This research inform consent accord `` Scientific , technical administrative standard health research '' Ministry Health Decree 309 2000 Ministry Environment . This consider minimal risk research , therapeutic intervention widely use treat patient condition .</detailed_description>
