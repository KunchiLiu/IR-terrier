	<brief_summary>The aim CardShock Study recognise significant prognostic factor order detect patient increase mortality risk one could possibly direct intensive treatment . The study provide clinical , functional invasive haemodynamic measure systematic serial sample evaluation . In addition , knowledge pathophysiology cardiogenic shock increase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiogenic shock ( CS ) life-threatening emergency situation high hospital mortality 50 % . Despite good treatment strategy include early echocardiography , insertion pulmonary artery catheter optimize haemodynamic status , early revascularization therapy , use intra-aortic balloon pump , prognosis remain poor 50 % patient discharge alive hospital . Most commonly CS occur massive ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( AMI ) - 8 % AMIs . The importance early clinical recognition develop CS crucial since 2/3 CS develop hospital admission . In addition , 20 % cardiogenic shock patient develop systemic inflammatory response syndrome resemble clinical picture septic shock . The clinical picture CS range florid shock low-output state . The in-hospital length stay cost care many time higher shock AMI patient Despite extreme clinical importance CS , mostly descriptive parameter serial evaluation biomarkers clinical condition analyse . All , scientific data still sparse . Study design European investigator initiate multicentre study . A minimum 100 ( 200 ) consecutive patient cardiogenic shock recruit study . Standardized treatment protocol individual participate centre base international guideline heart failure apply every patient study . Coronary angiography percutaneous coronary intervention , vasoactive inotropic medication , pulmonary artery catheter intra-aortic balloon pump utilize applicable . Echocardiographies 14-lead ECG record . Demographic clinical data well serial blood urine sample ( 8 time point CCU/ICU stay ) collect . CardShock Registry The patient exclude study due time onset shock longer six hour record Registry ( screen failure ) log . These patient form CardShock Registry include clinical data ( include in-hospital mortality ) study sample post-discharge follow-up .</detailed_description>
