	<brief_title>Evaluation CardioSond Electronic Stethoscope Detection Coronary Artery Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The CardioSond noninvasive medical device detects heart sound use ultrasensitive acoustic technology . The CardioSond produce flow micro bruit score use determine likelihood coronary artery disease . The CardioSond exam give patient two time : prior administration vasodilator potential beta blockade agent part normal cardiac CT angiography protocol immediately post CT angiography . No data take patient patient involvement study cease data collection . CT angiography data analyze core lab Medstar Research Institute withhold SonoMedica CardioSond acoustic data analyze flow micro bruit score determine . A data review panel lead principal investigator examine result CardioSond CT angiography data determine comparative accuracy CardioSond detecting CAD study population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Willingness sign inform consent . Inability provide informed consent History prior myocardial infarction , percutaneous coronary intervention ( i.e . stent ) coronary artery bypass graft surgery Heart rate 70 beat per minute post beta blockade Artery calcification result nondiagnostic CT angiographic image Supraventricular ventricular arrhythmia would expect affect CT angiography image quality ( e.g . atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , ventricular tachycardia , bigeminy trigeminy ) . Patients isolated premature atrial contraction premature ventricular contraction may enroll Any pulmonary condition would create abnormal physical finding would interfere fidelity cardiac sound recording ( e.g . obstructive pulmonary disease , asthma COPD , audible wheezing ) Presence audible aortic pulmonic diastolic murmur , tricuspid mitral flow diastolic murmur continuous murmur Any chest wall configuration prevent adequate contact CardioSond acoustic recording sensor precordium Any medical condition would expect affect CT angiography image quality</criteria>
