	<brief_summary>Pain control follow surgery critical aspect patient care . Pain incision sit laparoscopic surgery contribute overall pain felt patient . There definitive proof typical medication ( lidocaine ) inject incision site surgery improve pain control . This study look different type medication ( ketorolac - NSAID ) good control pain laparoscopic incision site .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>As push minimally invasive economical procedure increase , special attention pay reason patient experience complication , unanticipated outpatient visit require prolonged recovery time even unplanned hospital admission . Insufficient pain control one prime reason increase level care ( 16 , 17 ) , pain define `` conscious unpleasant sensory emotional experience associate actual potential tissue damage '' ( 12 ) . Appropriate pain control may advantageously affect length hospital stay relate expense , decrease chronic pain syndrome , improve patient experience result few complication postoperative period ( 12 ) . Multiple method analgesia employ improve pain control procedure , include intravenous medication , regional anesthesia local injection ( 12 , 16 , 17 ) . Laparoscopic procedures typically involve general anesthesia , effort improve recovery post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) anesthesiologists employ shorter act agent ( 2 ) . Patients receive short act anesthetic agent likely bypass PACU , particularly patient undergo gynecologic surgery ( 2 ) . This alleviate , fact may intensify , need adequate pain control immediate postoperative period . Several strategy test effort improve analgesia critical time period , include intravenous , regional local anesthesia ( 12 ) . Multiple type pain medication use improve postsurgical pain . Opioids commonly use , however may associate multiple negative affect include nausea vomiting , delay gastric empty , sedation respiratory depression ( 12 ) . Postoperative nausea vomiting , pain control drowsiness factor contribute prolonged recovery room stay ( 15 ) . Other medication may use decrease opioid consumption , even common analgesic . Acetaminophen find decrease opioid requirement postoperatively 20 % ( 12 ) . Postoperative NSAID use quite common ( 12 ) . With respect NSAIDs particular , ketorolac utilized due ability improve pain control lessen amount opioid medication give ( 12 ) . Ketorolac offer advantage opioids , particularly respect avoidance decrease opioid associate side effect ( 4 ) . These advantage implication patient comfort length hospital stay follow surgery . The use adjunct non-opioid medication may lead short PACU stay , decrease discharge time few adverse effect respiratory depression postoperative nausea vomiting ( 4 , 5 , 15 ) . Cassinelli et al demonstrate improved pain control use IV ketorolac follow lumbar decompression surgery , show patient decreased morphine requirement improve pain score follow surgery . Coloma et al compare intravenous versus local ketorolac versus normal saline follow anorectal surgery find use ketorolac form decrease pain score . This clinically significant decreased requirement oral pain medication without concomitant increase side effect complication . That group find although IV local ketorolac provide pain relief follow surgery , local administration give statistically significant low pain score arrival PACU short time discharge compare control . In addition , study Ben-David find administration 30 mg ketorolac locally improve pain score 60 mg give intramuscularly ( 22 ) . A comparison orthopedic surgery local v systemic administration ketorolac show improved pain score local administration ( 23 ) . These beneficial finding way universal . Kardash et al compare ketorolac use patient undergo hernia repair find difference pain level postoperatively whether patient ketorolac inject either site incision peripherally ( case subcutaneous injection contralateral abdominal wall ) . These finding mitigate somewhat due lack control group , omit primarily author felt NSAIDs routine part postoperative pain control could ethically withhold . Ketorolac drawbacks form suspect hematologic impact affect platelet aggregation bleeding time must use cautiously patient renal compromise ( 12 ) . The source pain multifactorial , include intra-abdominal discomfort procedure also skin incision well ( 3 ) . Multiple study compare local anesthesia inject site laparoscopic incision normal saline control . Khaira et al examine normal saline vs. bupivacaine injection surgical incision site early surgery find decrease parenteral opioid use patient receive anesthetic injection . Cansino et al compare oral NSAID combine lidocaine paracervical block oral placebo paracervical block include lidocaine ketorolac first trimester surgical abortion . They find improved pain control combine paracervical block particularly cervical dilation , although remain pain score significantly different . Mohair et al examined effect infiltration pain medication postoperative pain control patient undergo breast augmentation . They infiltrate normal saline , ketorolac , bupivacaine ketorolac bupivacaine breast pocket follow dissection . Their result suggest combined medication improve pain level immediately postoperative time discharge outpatient surgery center . Each pain medication alone also improve pain score although less extent . It unclear statistical significance translates clinical significance . A follow initial study pain medication infiltrate breast pocket breast augmentation follow long term pain score postoperative patient either normal saline combination ketorolac bupivacaine infiltrate surgery . Results show improved pain score first five postoperative day determine visual analogue scale amount pain medication use analgesic solution infiltrate surgery . Again , remain unclear whether clinically significant , amount pain medication utilize differ approximately one two tablet daily . Mahabir et al theorize possible benefit ketorolac bupivacaine could stem difference pKa two medication . The pKa ketorolac 3.5 , indicate high activity acidic tissue , damage inflamed , relative medication bupivacaine basic pKa 8.1 ( 16 ) . Not type analgesia question also time administration : preincisional vs. surgical closure . Einarsson et al specifically investigated local pain control laparoscopic port site use patient control . This study compare pain control patient bupivacaine normal saline infiltrate port site , use patient control find postoperative administration bupivicaine result good pain control . Ke et al examine efficacy pain control respect medication administer well time compare infiltration wound either bupivacaine normal saline initial incision incision closure . The result indicate pre-incision injection provide good pain control longer lasting analgesic effect , however study limit small sample size lead possibly less significant result . Lam et al also investigate local pain control laparoscopic port sit placebo control trial use either lignocaine normal saline initial incision closing case . Their result advocate use analgesia time closure , show decreased pain score 24 hour postoperatively group , minimal improvement preemptive analgesia . These result may clinically significant despite decreased pain score , amount pain medication utilize . Despite study indicate improved pain control local anesthesia , multiple randomize , placebo control , double blind study show significant difference saline bupivacaine respect post operative pain ( 18-21 ) .</detailed_description>
