	<detailed_description>Background : There significant rise number people live well old age . Aging associated loss muscle strength serious import physical disability . Age-related physical disability associate physical dependence , poor quality life , mortality . Treatment age-related physical disability focus prevention condition rather consequence . Need modify daily task early sign future mobility disability . Many old adult utilize daily task modification report mobility difficulty . Neglect self-report task modification may delay intervention . Identifying objective marker task modification help identify task modifier . Loss muscle strength associate mobility decline . Older adult engage habitual physical activity ( PA ) likely maintain physical independence shortly natural end life . Yet , many old adult physically active . Health-care professional general physical therapist particular , unique position promote PA among old adult . Healthcare provider habitually engage PA likely consult patient PA guideline . Purposes : The purpose follow study : 1 ) examine low extremity muscle strength across subject , utilize task modification , 2 ) determine strength association low extremity muscle strength daily task modification older adult live independently , 3 ) identify functionally relevant isometric isokinetic cutpoints low extremity muscle strength daily task modification prevalent , 4 ) compare relative diagnostic accuracy isometric versus isokinetic strength cutpoints relate daily task modification , 5 ) estimate rate participation moderate vigorous physical activity ( PA ) among student physical therapist ( SPTs ) , 6 ) compare estimate rate PA among US adult , 7 ) ass barrier PA among SPTs Methods : To address first two purpose , fifty-three community dwell male ( 21 ) female ( 32 ) old adult ( 76.4±5.2 year ) observe perform chair rise , negotiate stair , kneel stand position , rise supine stand . Levels daily task modification assess use previously describe , valid , reliable tool [ MOD ] . The MOD assess task modification use six hierarchically ranked category zero ( modification ) five ( refusal ) . Rankings sum across task . A score ≥5 point sum MOD score cutpoint classification daily Task-Modifiers ( TM ) None-Task-Modifiers ( NTM ) . Normalized body weight Isometric measure peak muscle torque obtain hip extensor , knee extensor , ankle plantar flexor use Biodex test device . A net anti-gravity composite measure isometric low extremity muscle force production sagittal plane ( NETforce ) calculate sum normalized torque three muscle group . An independent t-test use compare group ( TM vs. NTM ) across dependent measure muscular torque . A logistic regression model use determine association torque measure group assignment . To address third forth purpose fifty-three community dwell male ( 21 ) female ( 32 ) old adult ( 76.4±5.2 year ) observe perform activity . Normalized body weight isometric isokinetic ( 60⁰ per second ) measure peak muscle strength obtain hip extensor , knee extensor , ankle plantar flexor use Biodex Isokinetic test device . A composite torque output calculate sum normalized torque three muscle group . An independent t-test use compare group ( TM vs. NTM ) across dependent measure muscular torque . Discriminant analysis { { 1397 Hasegawa , R . 2008 } } repeat predictor variable separately determine minimal strength cutpoints normalize composite low extremity isometric isokinetic strength output would optimally differentiate TM NTM group . An ROC curve analysis perform determine sensitivity specificity . A repeated , separate logistic regression group classification dependent variable low extremity strength measure independent variable conduct . For statistical test , P-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . All data analysis perform use SPSS ( version 18 ; SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . A p value .05 use reject null hypothesis . To address last three purpose , apply cross-sectional survey design [ N = 126 SPTs enrol professional ( entry level ) physical therapist education program ] . Frequencies , percentage , cross-tabulations follow chi-square test use address purpose number 5 6 . Qualitative ( cod ) follow non-parametric statistical procedure use assess purpose number 7 .</detailed_description>
