	<brief_summary>Background The Activity GEriatric acute CARe ( AGECAR ) randomize control trial ass effectiveness intrahospital strength walk program short hospital stay improve functional capacity patient age 75 year old . Methods Patients age 75 year older admit short hospital stay ( ≤14 day ) randomly assign either usual care ( control ) group intervention ( train ) group . Participants allocate usual care group receive normal hospital care participant allocate intervention group perform multiple session per day low limb strength training ( stand seat position ) walking ( 10 min bout ) hospitalize . The Primary outcome assess pre post hospital stay functional capacity , use Short Physical Performance Battery ( SPPB ) , time walk 10 meter . Besides length hospitalization , secondary outcome also assess hospital admission discharge pulmonary ventilation ( forced expiratory volume one second , FEV1 ) peripheral oxygen saturation . The secondary outcome assess telephone interview three month discharge mortality , number fall since discharge , ability cope activity daily live ( ADLs , use Katz ADL score Barthel ADL index ) . Results Results help well understand potential regular physical activity short hospital stay improve functional capacity old patient . Conclusions The increase life expectancy result large segment population 75 year age increase hospitalization age group . This call attention health care system public health policymakers focus promote method improve functional capacity population .</brief_summary>
