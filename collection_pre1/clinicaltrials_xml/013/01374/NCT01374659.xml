	<brief_summary>Several study indicate [ 124I ] -PET/CT [ 18F ] -FDG-PET/CT may useful locate recurrent differentiate thyroid carcinoma lesion patient elevate thyroglobulin level show pathological lesion conventional imaging modality use . Thus , investigator evaluate effectiveness PET/CT use [ 124I ] [ 18F ] -FDG patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>&lt; Inclusion Criteria &gt; Patients histologically proven DTC study . All patient previously undergone total thyroidectomy one session postoperative RI therapy . More 12 month follow-up last RI therapy session , patient show increase pathological Tg level ( Tg &gt; 9-10 ng/ml ) TSH stimulation ( TSH &gt; 30 mU/l ) . However , neither tumor recurrence metastasis could detect patient post-therapeutic [ 131I ] scanning , neck US , chest radiography . Patients obvious cervical pathology positive fine-needle aspiration cytology ( FNAC ) exclude study . The work approve Institutional Review Board write inform consent obtain patient . &lt; Study protocol &gt; The study prospectively design evaluate diagnostic efficacy [ 18F ] -FDG-PET/CT [ 124I ] -PET/CT patient elevate Tg level , yield pathological finding conventional imaging . The [ 124I ] radioisotope supply Radiopharmaceutical Research Team Korea Institute Radiological Medical Sciences ( KIRAMS ) . All involved patient underwent diagnostic [ 131I ] scan , [ 18F ] -FDG-PET/CT , [ 124I ] -PET/CT . On first day ( D1 ) study , blood urine collect routine examination ; measure blood TSH , Tg , anti-Tg antibody level ; assess urine iodine excretion 4 week levothyroxine ( LT4 ) withdrawal . All patient consume low-iodine diet prior 2 week , follow write instruction assist dietician . On second day ( D2 ) study , [ 131I ] scan obtain 48 h administration 74 MBq [ 131I ] . On day 10 ( D10 ) study , patient fast least 4 h examination , ( intravenously ) give 370 MBq [ 18F ] -FDG . All patient instruct rest comfortably 60 min empty bladder scan . Whole-body PET/CT image obtain use Discovery ST scanner ( GE Healthcare , Milwaukee , WI ) . Seven eight frame ( 3 min/frame ) emission PET data acquire two-dimensional mode noncontrast CT scan perform base skull upper thigh ( tube rotation time 1 per revolution ; 120 kV ; 60 mA ; 7.5 mm per rotation ; acquisition time 60.9 scan length 867 mm ) . Emission PET image reconstruct via non-contrast CT use iterative method ( ordered-subsets expectation maximization two iteration 30 subset ; field view 600 mm ; slice thickness 3.27 mm ) . Attenuation-corrected PET/CT image review Xeleris workstation ( GE Healthcare ) . All image independently interpret two experienced nuclear medicine physician screen `` hot spot '' indicative hypermetabolic abnormality . On day 11 ( D11 ) study , 24 h administration [ 124I ] trace dose ( 74 MBq ) , whole-body PET/CT scan obtain use Discovery ST scanner . First , non-enhanced CT scan perform , base skull upper thigh ( tube rotation time 1 per revolution ; 140 kV ; 80 mA ; 3.75 mm per rotation ; acquisition time 23.9 scan length 804 mm ) . Subsequently , seven eight frame ( 5 min per frame ) emission PET data acquire two-dimensional mode reconstruct via CT use iterative method ( software General Electric Medical Systems ; ordered-subsets expectation maximization two iteration 21 subset ; field view 600 mm ; slice thickness 3.27 mm ) . &lt; Data analysis &gt; To ensure interpretation [ 18F ] -FDG-PET/CT [ 124I ] -PET/CT data perform similar condition , physician initially read image one type deliberately blind result type imaging , patient clinical data . This achieve ensure interpret physician involve patient clinical care . Findings [ 18F ] -FDG-PET [ 124I ] -PET scan compare data diagnostic post-therapeutic [ 131I ] scan . Moreover , data compare radiological imaging ( US , CT , MRI information ) , and/or cytological investigation ( FNAC ) , confirm ( otherwise ) finding [ 131I ] scan , form PET/CT ( use [ 18F ] -FDG [ 124I ] ) . For patient , presence absence , number localization recurrent lesion ( present ) determine . The data type PET/CT scan classify follow : 1 ) True-positive , pathologic [ 18F ] -FDG [ 124I ] uptake proven histology , cytology , image technique , cause therapy change ; 2 ) False-positive , pathologic [ 18F ] -FDG [ 124I ] uptake see ( observation clinical consequence ) ; 3 ) True-negative , [ 18F ] -FDG [ 124I ] uptake find patient neither elevated Tg level evidence recurrence upon subsequent follow-up ; , 4 ) False-negative [ 18F ] -FDG [ 124I ] uptake note despite elevate Tg level , even positive finding obtain image method employ .</detailed_description>
