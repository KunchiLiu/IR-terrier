	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) common scenario intensive care unit . Discussions exponentially grow due high mortality rate world low quality life among survivor . Mechanical ventilation recognize play important role treatment patient ARDS . However , mechanical ventilation potential produce worsen alveolar injury inadequate strategy choose . Several study compare different mechanical ventilation strategy ARDS result remain uncertain regard influence survival patient ARDS . Thus , multicentric randomize controlled trial , allocation concealment intention treat analysis investigate maximum alveolar recruitment maneuver association Positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) titrate static compliance respiratory system ( ART strategy ) able increase 28 day survival patient ARDS compare conventional strategy propose ARDS Clinical Network ( ARDSNet strategy ) . Patients consider trial mechanical ventilation diagnosis ARDS le 72hours . Patients exclude less 18 year old , use vasopressor drug increase dos last 2 hour mean arterial blood pressure less 65mmHg , presence contraindication hypercapnia , undrained pneumothorax subcutaneous emphysema lack consent patient 's surrogate participation . Patients include randomized receive ART strategy ARDSNet strategy follow hospital discharge , 28 day 6 month .</brief_summary>
