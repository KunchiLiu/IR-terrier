	<brief_summary>Objectives phase 2 prospective , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study ass safety efficacy TRO40303 administer balloon inflation percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) limitation infarct size patient treat acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . The study conduct 9 centre Sweden , Denmark , Norway France . One hundred eighty patient include . It last one month per patient overall duration 11 month . The efficacy assess infarct size express area curve creatine kinase troponin I ( blood sample D1 , D2 D3 ) , also evaluate Cardiac Magnetic Resonance . Safety assess - clinic evaluation , - blood sample ( hematology , biochemistry , renal hepatic function ) , - Recording follow-up major adverse event occur first 48h reperfusion ( death , heart failure , AMI , stroke , recurrent ischemia , need repeat revascularization , renal hepatic , vascular complication bleeding ) . - ECG - Recording cardiac event one month AMI - Follow-up global leave ventricular function Echocardiography D3 D30 . Demographic medical history inclusion non-cardiac event occur first 30 day record . TRO40303 plasma concentration assess 15 min , 6h , 12h post end administration . Sample size calculation assume reduction 35 % AUC Troponin I release , statistical power 85 % probability type I error 0.05 . Main analysis : between-group comparison AUCs serum troponin I CK release perform use O'Brien 's method multiple endpoint test . Secondary analysis : comparison CMR criterion describe perform use mixed model ANCOVA . All analysis perform Full Analysis Set Per protocol population . Safety analysis : A comparison incidence cumulative adverse clinical event group perform Fisher 's exact test . Subjects undergo primary PCI receive concomitant medication accord current standard care . After coronary angiography perform balloon inflation perform , patient meet enrollment criterion randomly assign either control group TRO40303 group . Randomization ensure take treatment unit ascend consecutive order stratum ( anterior/posterior determine ECG ) . Just balloon inflation , ideally less 5 minute , maximum 15 minute balloon inflation stenting , patient TRO40303 group receive intravenous slow-bolus ( 35 mL/min ) injection 6 mg/kg TRO40303 inject peripheral IV . The patient control group receive equivalent volume placebo . Patients hospitalize long medical indication . CMR echocardiography accordingly conduct in/out patient day 3 ( ideally ) 5 . A follow-up visit conduct one month PCI .</brief_summary>
