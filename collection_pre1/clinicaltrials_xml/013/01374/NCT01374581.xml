	<brief_summary>This bi-centric phase IIIb , randomize , open label , 3-arm clinical trial perform investigate impact retreatment Artemisinin-Based Combination ( ACT ) , example Arthemeter-Lumefantrine ( AL ) Uganda ( Ug ) artesunate-amodiaquine ( ASAQ ) RDCongo , malaria incidence potential selection resistant strain . Patients followed-up efficacy safety 42 day treatment first line therapy recommend national authority ( arthemeter-lumefantrine Uganda artesunate-amodiaquine RDCongo ) retreat patient either ACT ACT oral Quinine + clyndamicin . The investigator hypothesize ( ) treatment first line ACT treatment beyond 14 day efficacious rescue treatment , without risk select drug resistant strain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RATIONALE Following World Health Organization ( WHO ) guideline , African country opt ACT . Several clinical trial ASAQ , ACT , complete Africa show efficacy &gt; 90 % ( 3-5 ) . Furthermore , The polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis , 75 % ASAQ &amp; AL treatment failure classify new infection , recrudescence low parasite density . ASAQ safe easy administer , good treatment adherence . Therefore , effectiveness may close efficacy . ASAQ develop fixed-dose combination register . The Democratic Republic Congo ( DRC ) also choose ASAQ first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria . Efficacy 6 dose regimen AL demonstrate semi-immune non-immune population Asia Africa consistently great 95 % , rapid parasite symptom clearance significant gametocidal effect . In Uganda , AL already choose first-line treatment uncomplicated malaria . In DRC Uganda , quinine rescue treatment malaria . It cheap , widely available generally consider effective popular due unwanted side effect . Quinine short half life , therefore repeat dosing require . In efficacy study quinine artemisinin uncomplicated malaria Vietnam , recrudescence rate 16 % 7 day quinine monotherapy . In study conduct Gabon , Plasmodium falciparum Vitro sensitivity quinine high change past decade . Although quinine monotherapy show high efficacy set clinical trial , considerable disadvantage , mainly poor tolerability prolong treatment course . Poor adherence carry high risk treatment failure , particularly quinine cause syndrome adverse effect know cinchonism include primarily tinnitus , nausea , vertigo . Other report side effect high tone hearing impairment , dizziness , hypotension well headache visual disturbance . As result side effect , study report poor compliance treatment . A randomized trial Thailand report 71 % adherence Such poor adherence 7-days regimen associate high risk treatment failure , contribute development spread resistance . Furthermore , field circumstance patient often re-treated recommend first line drug , i.e . ASAQ . As quinine effective specie malaria include chloroquine-resistant strain P. falciparum , widely use treatment severe malaria . Therefore , protect resistance rational use , effectiveness uncomplicated malaria low ACT . Rationale Considering fact : 90 % treatment failure ASAQ AL new infection , parasitaemia low case recrudescence occur day 14 real-life situation patient re-treated first line drug , need assess role first line treatment rescue treatment . This efficacy compare quinine + clindamycin another ACT treatment line WHO guideline , another ACT treatment provide clear guideline . The investigator hypothesize re-treatment first line ACT treatment beyond 14 day efficacious rescue treatment , without risk select drug resistant strain . Furthermore , prolong follow allow assessment epidemiological , parasite related risk factor repeat malaria infection collect sample immunological risk factor repeat malaria attack . TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Efficacy The primary objective : 1. show , child age 12 59 month recurrent uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria within 42 day treatment artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ASAQ DRC AL Uganda ) , PCR adjust efficacy 28 day re-treatment artemisinin-based combination therapy least 90 % 2. estimate relative efficacy re-treatment artemisinin-based combination compare treatment quinine treatment another artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ASAQ first line AL treatment AL first line ASAQ treatment ) . Secondary objective : 1 . To evaluate PCR-unadjusted efficacy 28 day re-treatment artemisinin-based combination therapy compare treatment quinine + clindamycin treatment another artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ASAQ first line AL treatment AL first line ASAQ treatment ) . 2 . To evaluate compare efficacy AL , ASAQ quinine + clindamycin rescue treatment recurrent P. falciparum malaria episode occur 2 week administration first line treatment , without PCR adjustment . 3 . To evaluate compare 42 day clinical efficacy AL ( Uganda ) ASAQ ( RDC ) first line treatment uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria , without PCR adjustment . 4 . To evaluate compare efficacy different rescue treatment regimens term fever clearance time , asexual parasite clearance time , gametocytaemia day 7 , 14 , 21 28 , , Hemoglobin change day 0 day 14 28 . Additional objective : 1 . To evaluate selection Plasmodium falciparum pfmdr1 allele follow therapy quinine + clindamycin , AL ASAQ . 2 . To assess epidemiological , parasitological host related predictor recurrent malaria infection , adjacent study develop separate nest study protocol . Safety To evaluate safety tolerability AL , ASAQ quinine + clindamycin use rescue treatment . DRUG TO BE TESTED Quinine Quinamax® ( Sanofi ) + Clindamycin Dalacin® ( Pfizer ) : study investigator use Dalacin syrup ( 75mg/5ml ) dry Quinamax® tablet ( 125mg ) dosage adapt child 9 kg . The latter explain child 12 month exclude study Artemether-lumefantrine ( AL ) AL Novartis , market trademark Riamet® Coartem® , register Switzerland 1999 , pre-qualified WHO since receive marketing authorisation several endemic non-endemic country . A recent review show drug combination highly efficacious sensitive multidrug resistant falciparum malaria offer advantage rapid clearance parasites artemether slow elimination residual parasites lumefantrine . Amodiaquine artesunate ASAQ safe , easy use efficacious second use ACT worldwide . DRC , National Malaria Control Program comply WHO recommendation recommend since 2005 ASAQ first line treatment uncomplicated malaria . In study conducted 2004 eastern part country , efficacy ASAQ estimate 93 % PCR adjustment . Twenty five trial ( 11,700 patient ) carry Sub-Saharan Africa show PCR-adjusted efficacy day 28 94 % . ASAQ currently second use ACT globally ( co formulate Co-arsucam® ASAQ Winthrop® , Sanofi-Aventis . A study conduct Burkina Faso child 5 show co-formulated ASAQ well tolerate efficacy 93 % PCR correction . The investigator use co-formulated ASAQ Winthrop® Sanofi-Aventis , age dose put market since March 2007 . This product pre-qualified WHO . STUDY DESIGN This bi-centre , phase IIIb , randomize , open label , 3-arm trial .</detailed_description>
