	<brief_summary>The human body know biphasic immunological reaction sepsis . First , pro-inflammatory reaction take place , mark release pro-inflammatory cytokine like TNF-α , reaction bacterial toxin . Secondly , counter regulatory anti-inflammatory reaction arises . This phase act negative feedback inflammation inhibition pro-inflammatory cytokine . This call `` immunoparalysis '' , pronounce immunosuppressive state , render patient vulnerable opportunistic infection . Most septic patient survive initial pro-inflammatory phase , die second stage.Research past show immunostimulatory therapy GM-CSF IFN-γ promising effect pro-inflammatory reaction immunoparalysis ex vivo . Both drug know immunostimulatory effect . Recent pilot study show septic patient , long-lasting monocyte deactivation sepsis ex vivo reverse two immunostimulants . However , mechanism extent immunoparalysis recovery may different two compound . Previously show human endotoxemia ( induced LPS ) , lead marked immunosuppression healthy individual , characterize transient refractory state subsequent LPS challenge ( endotoxin tolerance ) . Consequently , human endotoxemia serve standardize , control model sepsis-induced immunoparalysis . Until , study focus ex vivo tolerance . However , recently prove , ex vivo condition completely representative vivo situation . Ex vivo , leukocyte tolerance LPS resolve within one day , vivo immunoparalysis persist two week . In project , investigate effect GM-CSF IFN-γ parallel double-blind placebo control randomized manner immunoparalysis follow human endotoxemia , in-vitro vivo . As result , hope get insight pathophysiology sepsis-induced immunoparalysis thereby develop new immunostimulatory therapy improve patient outcome</brief_summary>
