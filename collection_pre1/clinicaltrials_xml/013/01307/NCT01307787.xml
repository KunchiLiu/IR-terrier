	<detailed_description>Currently , effectiveness program consist education improve disease self-management combine intensive exercise clear . In present study investigator develop group-based program people RA consist physical exercise increase physical performance ( i.e . aerobic capacity muscle strength ) combine educational program improve disease self-management ( self-reported health status self-efficacy ) . The investigator call 'FIT program ' . The aim present randomize control trial ( RCT ) examine effect FIT program aerobic capacity , muscle strength , self-reported health status self-efficacy , population people RA .
