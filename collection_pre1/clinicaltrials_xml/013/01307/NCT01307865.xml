	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect Sculptra Aesthetic cosmetic rejuvenation midface complex . The investigator plan qualitatively determine restoration midface architecture well quantitatively document change midface volume employ three-dimensional ( 3D ) surface image critically analyze volumetric tissue change . Our hypothesis patient receive Sculptra Aesthetic injection experience significant improvement facial midface volume restoration . - Measure midfacial volumetric correction Sculptra Aesthetic treatment , use three-dimensional digital surface image - Determine mean change baseline facial contour via quantitative volumetric measurement - Correlate volumetric correction clinical improvement measure Facial Lipoatrophy Panel grade system - Correlate mean volumetric change midfacial treatment area amount product use - Obtain photographs pre- post-treatment purpose provide subject visual aid course treatment - Collect safety data</brief_summary>
