	<brief_summary>Breast cancer commonly diagnose cancer second lead cause cancer death American woman . Metastatic disease include metastatic breast cancer unfortunately remain incurable . One reason due inability develop specific therapy specific cancer subset . The use modern genomic technique significantly enhance recent understanding breast cancer biology . Five distinct breast cancer subset recognize , one basal-like breast cancer . Basal-like breast cancer typically estrogen receptor ( ER ) negative , progesterone receptor ( PR ) negative human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER-2-Neu ) negative . This referred triple negative breast cancer TBNC . TBNC represent significant proportion breast cancer patient ( 10-20 % ) poor prognosis target approach therapy yet . Tigatuzumab humanize monoclonal antibody target death receptor breast cancer cell . Previous study show combine antibody select chemotherapy agent induced tumor cell death . The hypothesis study use tigatuzumab combine Abraxane serve target agent metastatic TBNC patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Abraxane With Without Tigatuzumab Patients With Metastatic , Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open-label randomize , multi-institutional , phase II clinical trial Abraxane combination tigatuzumab Abraxane single agent patient TNBC . Randomization ( 2:1 ) make two category : TBNC patient prior chemotherapy metastatic disease TBNC patient prior taxane ( except Abraxane ) therapy metastatic disease . Patients randomized Abraxane alone may allow cross combination Abraxane + tigatuzumab disease progression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must pathologically document Stage IV breast cancer . If block ( paraffinembedded tissue ) original diagnosis available , obtain confirm diagnosis correlative study . Fifteen slide obtain block block available sent release . Tumor must HER2neu negative ( define 0 1+ stain immunohistochemistry gene amplification ratio less equal 2.0 , fluorescent situ hybridization FISH ) , estrogen progesterone receptor negative ( &lt; 10 % ) . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) Biopsy metastatic lesion require protocol entry patient reasonably accessible lesion ( chest wall , breast , skin , subcutaneous , superficial lymph node , bone liver metastasis ) must agree biopsy . 1 . Biopsies may do local anesthesia intravenous conscious sedation , accord standard institutional guideline . 2 . If biopsy require general anesthesia , allow acquisition tissue necessary clinical reason excess tissue would otherwise discard used research purpose . If biopsy require general anesthesia , biopsy site research purpose , without coexist clinical indication allow protocol . 3 . Patients reasonably accessible lesion describe , agree biopsy , enrol trial . 4 . Patients NO reasonably accessible lesion describe enrolled trial . Prior Therapy : There restriction number prior regimens metastatic disease long patient adequate performance status . Patients prior chemotherapy metastatic disease patient receive prior therapy taxanes metastatic disease ( taxol taxotere ) eligible . Stratification use randomization two category ( prior chemotherapy metastatic disease prior taxane therapy metastatic disease ) . Chemotherapy treatment prior enrollment must discontinue least 3 week prior study entry . Patients must complete radiation therapy least 7 day prior begin protocol treatment . Patients must recover reversible toxicity relate prior therapy begin protocol treatment , may pre exist treatmentrelated toxicity excess grade 1 . Patients must &lt; grade 2 preexist peripheral neuropathy . Patients may receive bisphosphonates ; however , use , bone lesion may use progression response . At least 18 year age ( 19 Alabama ) . Life expectancy great 12 week . ECOG performance status &lt; equal 2 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count : &gt; equal 1,500/mcL , Hemoglobin : &gt; equal 9 mg/dL , Platelets : &gt; equal 100,000/mcL , Total bilirubin : &lt; equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal , AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) : &lt; equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal without liver metastasis , OR &lt; equal 5 X institutional upper limit normal document liver metastasis , Creatinine : &lt; equal 2.0 mg/dL , OR calculate creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min ( calculate Cockcroft Gault method ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Both men woman eligible . Use effective mean contraception subject childbearing potential . Negative serum urine betaHCG pregnancy test screening patient childbearing potential . Patients may receive investigational agent . Prior use Abraxane metastatic disease adjuvant setting . Metastatic lesion identifiable PET . Patients may receive concurrent chemotherapy treatment metastatic disease . Active brain metastasis : evidence progression &lt; equal 3 month local therapy ( patient asymptomatic corticosteroid anticonvulsant least 3 month prior study entry ) . Patients brain metastasis must least one site measurable disease outside central nervous system . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , history recent myocardial infarction , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant lactate woman exclude . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother , breastfeed discontinue mother treat . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . A prior invasive malignant disease within five year except skin cancer ( squamous cell basal cell carcinoma ) . Patients known history HIV Hepatitis B potential add toxicity treatment regimen . Dementia alter mental status would prohibit understanding informed consent .</criteria>
