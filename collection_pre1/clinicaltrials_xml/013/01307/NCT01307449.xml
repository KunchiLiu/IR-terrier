	<brief_summary>Vaccination effective way prevent infectious disease . Despite success vaccine general , vaccine induce diminish antibody response low protection elderly particular . This could explain defect early response age immune system . A good understanding basic immunological mechanism mediate vaccine efficacy incomplete . Such information critical could greatly decrease cost time new vaccine development particularly geriatric population . In trial , investigator study immunologic difference two FDA approve licensed pneumococcal vaccine young old group . Twenty two healthy volunteer age 25-40 sixty six healthy volunteer age 60-89 enrolled study . Each participant study give one pneumococcal shot . Blood work obtain prior vaccination , one day , three day , seven day , fourteen day , well one month six month vaccination . Throughout duration study , participant monitor safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Systems Biology PNEUMOVAX®23 PREVNAR 13®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : PCV13 [ 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ( Prevnar®13 ) ] induces well functional immune response compare PPV23 [ 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( Pneumovax®23 ) ] old naïve adult . We hypothesize due intrinsic defect innate response could explain poor immunogenicity PPV23 compare PCV13 . Therefore , propose extensively study innate adaptive immune response generate administration either pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine old adult . STUDY DESIGN : Single center , open label study adult healthy volunteer vaccinate either PPV23 PCV13 . Blood sample collect Days D0 ( enrollment ) D1 , D3 , D7 , D14 , D30 D180 post vaccination study innate adaptive immune response . Even though PPV23 PCV13 consider safe , volunteer ask report local systemic AEs Day 0 ( vaccination ) Day 7 . Reactogenicity event also evaluate injection site examination visit D0 , D1 , D3 D7 . Also volunteer ask report local systemic AEs 30 day post vaccination SAEs 180 day post vaccination . Volunteers also ask report local systemic AEs develop day blood draw .</detailed_description>
