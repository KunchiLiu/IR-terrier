	<detailed_description>As part standard care , external beam radiation therapy . You computerized tomography ( CT ) scan pelvis external beam radiation therapy . For CT scan , give enema empty bowel , drink 16 24 ounce water fill bladder A rectal balloon insert rectum fill either air water . You CT scan . The CT scan take 45 minute . If agree take part study , thin ( millimeter-sized ) radiation detector attach rectal balloon two CT scan per week receiving radiation . You may additional CT scan ( without detector ) week doctor think need . The dos read radiation detector compare dos originally schedule receive radiation treatment end study . You study final radiation treatment use rectal balloon . This investigational study . Up 15 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
