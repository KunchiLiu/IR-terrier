	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Interproximal Plaque Gingivitis Effects Three Interdental Cleaning Modalities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint study residual protein concentration posterior site follow single use treatment either manual toothbrush , manual toothbrush + Sonicare IP clean prototype , manual toothbrush + Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser manual toothbrush + floss . Secondary Endpoints Gingival bleed index Modified gingival index follow single use treatment either MTB , MTB + IP clean prototype , MTB + Waterpik Waterflosser MTB + floss . Comparisons concentration level 272 different pathogen treatment group Biomarker profile follow different treatment modality Safety endpoint base adverse event intraoral exam ( soft tissue evaluation ) . IP clean satisfaction questionnaire follow treatment either MTB , MTB + IP clean prototype , MTB + Waterpik Waterflosser MTB + floss . Expected Duration Study The plan duration subject 's participation study approximately 2 week . Discontinuation Criteria/Stopping Rules If opinion investigator , health safety subject affect adversely participation study non-compliance at-home oral hygiene regimen adversely effect test product familiarization plaque regrowth , subject remove . Controls Minimize Bias All eligible subject randomize Visit 1 . Randomization Subjects Balance Test Groups Subjects randomize one four treatment group accord 1:1:1:1 ratio . Randomization stratify gender complete approximately 68 subject . Blinding The examiner laboratory personnel blind . Maintenance randomization Codes In order minimize bias , study randomize single blind - Examiners perform interproximal plaque sample gingivitis assessment designate blind personnel . Unblinding study data occur study procedure complete . Experimental Regimen Product Labeling Each subject receive ADA Reference manual toothbrush , timer , dentifrice , assign , IP clean device ( either Sonicare Prototype , Crest Glide Floss Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser ( WP 100 ) Classic Jet Tip ) . Subjects brush twice daily two minute , assign , use IP clean device daily , even , toothbrushing . The Directions Use device find protocol Appendices review subject shall demonstrate proper usage time product assignment . Methods Treatments Permitted Study Once enrol on-study , use additional oral hygiene treatment aid prescribe prohibit . A list prohibit device aid include limited mouthwash , chew gum , whiten product , non-assigned interproximal cleaning aids/devices breath film . The use dentifrice dispense Visit 2 prohibit . In event enrol subject require dental care outside scope study , he/she discontinue trial . The use antibiotic antibacterial agent participate study also prohibit subject require use removed dataset endpoint analysis . The use prescription strength repeat dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory anticoagulant ( include Aspirin ) longer 2 day also prohibit . All deviation prescribe treatment document continued eligibility reassess . Determination Sample Size Sample size justification base consideration statistical power detect difference mean residual protein concentration ( RPC ) manual toothbrush group manual toothbrush + Sonicare Interproximal ( IP ) Cleaning Prototype group . A sample size 17 per group visit 3 ( anticipated sample size allowance dropout ) provide 80 % power detect difference mean RPC group 4.71 ( µg/ml ) assume subject-level standard error average two RPC measurement 4.76 ( square standard error variance determine assume RPC IP site-specific standard deviation 6.15 , intramouth correlation two RPC measurement 0.2 , estimate statistical model ( see 8.6 ) preliminary data adjusts baseline RPC ) .</detailed_description>
