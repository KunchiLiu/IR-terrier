	<brief_summary>The Overstitch ( Apollo Endosurgery , Austin , Texas ) FDA clear product attache standard double channel endoscope . The Overstitch place suture endoscopic guidance , goal reproduce standard surgical technique . These would include hemostasis , tissue approximation , anastomosis formation , fixation intraluminal device , repair/closure mucosal full thickness defect perforation endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) sit . Knot tie endoscopically place suture provide endoscopic cinch device pass channel endoscope . This feasibility trial evaluate ability Apollo suturing device ( Overstitch ) endoscopically place suture normal mucosa , `` tie '' suture cinch device . These device utilize effectively explant , live porcine , human cadaver colon stomach model . In treat resect model , suture would place segment colon stomach surgically remove via open laparoscopic technique treatment benign malignant disease . The suture would place segment normal mucosa remote pathology surgically treat . In addition , suture place direct observation via laparoscopic open visualization . After resection segment colon , evaluate grossly level suture placement , evidence perforation , quality suture approximation cinch device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During colectomy procedure , intend proximal distal margin resection determine , protocol proceed fully determine tissue fully resectable . The overstitch device affixed standard double channel gastroscope advance transanally segment plan resect colon , away area disease interfere oncologic principle post-resection pathologic evaluation . Endoscopic suture knot tie cinch element place , limit 15 minute total procedure . The entire procedure closely monitor laparoscopic open surgical visualization . After suture placement , surgical resection continue plan . The specimen examine depth suture placement , evidence perforation , quality suture approximation knot tie element .</detailed_description>
