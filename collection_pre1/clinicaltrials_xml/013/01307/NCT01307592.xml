	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , oxaliplatin , , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer cell growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Lenalidomide may stop growth non-Hodgkin lymphoma block blood flow cancer . Giving rituximab chemotherapy together lenalidomide may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give rituximab , gemcitabine hydrochloride , oxaliplatin together lenalidomide work treat patient relapsed refractory , aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine rate conversion complete response ( CR ) switch lenalidomide patient relapse refractory , aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma whose maximum response gemcitabine hydrochloride , rituximab , oxaliplatin partial response ( PR ) . Secondary - To determine overall survival patient treat regimen . - To determine progression-free survival patient CR PR . - To determine treatment-related toxicity regimen combination patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . - Rituximab , gemcitabine hydrochloride , oxaliplatin : Patients B-cell lymphoma receive rituximab IV day 1 ; patient receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 day 2* . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients T-cell lymphoma proceed chemotherapy day 1 without receive rituximab ; patient B-cell lymphoma receive chemotherapy day 2 . Patients reevaluate 4 course therapy . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 course therapy proceed bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) ; receive BMT receive maintenance lenalidomide 2 year . Patients achieve partial response ( PR ) candidate autologous stem cell transplantation ( ACT ) treat lenalidomide** . Once patient PR achieve CR &lt; CR lenalidomide treatment , proceed maintenance lenalidomide 2 year , unless become candidate ACT*** . Patients stable disease progressive disease 4 course therapy treat lenalidomide , unless become eligible ACT*** . NOTE : **Patients delay &gt; 4 month would occur ACT treat lenalidomide 3 week prior ACT . NOTE : **Once eligible , patient proceed ACT soon feasible . - Maintenance lenalidomide : Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline periodically toxicity analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
