	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity diabetes old adult increase past 20 year increasingly affect medical social service , well cost time . Because old adult often portray less likely change long-standing health behavior , health promotion age group lag behind others . In fact , little attention give importance diabetes prevention management community-dwelling older adult . A recent report obesity diagnosis care practice Veterans Health Administration show elderly patient less likely receive obesity-related education counsel [ Noel 2010 ] . Intentional weight loss obese old adult widely advocate health care provider due perceive uncertainty whether benefit outweigh risk . There also need overcome barrier provide appropriate intervention blood pressure , glucose , lipid management tailor functionality old adult . The Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) demonstrate benefit modest weight loss , diet exercise , reduction diabetes risk participant race/ethnic group ( 58 % overall reduction 71 % reduction old population ) , leading delay 4 year 10-year period onset diabetes among received lifestyle intervention [ DPP 2002 , DPP 2009 ] . The DPP consider landmark study comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) , yet translate widespread public health practice . South Florida provide unique set accelerate adoption CER evidence practice address obesity diabetes challenge age population . There 800,000 multi-ethnic resident age 60 , many one chronic diseases [ CDC 2008 ] . A large number old veteran high-risk diabetes currently receive care Miami VA Healthcare System . Compelling scientific evidence exists lifestyle change delay onset type 2 diabetes high-risk person . Lifestyle intervention also lead reduction cardiovascular risk factor individual type 2 diabetes [ Look AHEAD research group 2007 ] . However , old adult succeed achieve intentional weight loss healthy diet increase physical activity . Furthermore , argue current US health system prepare deliver lifestyle intervention [ Narayan 2004 ] . Several issue relate integration lifestyle intervention clinical practice raise . Currently , unknown whether practice professional could deliver intervention community efficacy similar interventionists DPP , train counsel nutrition , exercise , behavior modification . The investigator propose use telemedicine application interactive web-based system . This allow participant get just-in-time feedback peer use target information specific area need reinforcement adopt healthy lifestyle good self-management skill old veteran . This bolster peer-participant interaction make focus around area adoption gap . This technology function platform social interaction lead increase self-efficacy well health outcome . The VA National Center Health Promotion Disease Prevention ( NCP ) develop MOVE ! weight management program base 1998/2000 Identification Treatment Overweight Obesity Adults Evidence Report . A major goal MOVE ! program reduce prevalence diabetes veteran . Our long-term goal reduce burden obesity-related chronic disease promote healthy age old veteran implementation best practice prevention . The main objective project implement evidence-informed , innovative intervention increase adoption finding comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) diabetes management prevention South Florida old veteran .</detailed_description>
