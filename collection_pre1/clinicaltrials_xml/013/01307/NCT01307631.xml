	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Patients With Recurrent Advanced Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess activity MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) patient recurrent persistent endometrial cancer classify phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic alpha ( PIK3CA ) mutation . Activity ascertain proportion patient survive progression-free least 6 month initiate therapy objective tumor response . II . To evaluate efficacy MK2206 patient serous tumor use composite endpoint complete partial response Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) progression-free interval 6 month longer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration progression-free survival overall survival . II . To determine nature degree toxicity MK-2206 assess version 4 National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria For Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) cohorts patient . III . To explore association select biomarkers response MK-2206 progression-free survival , objective tumor response , overall survival well patient characteristic histological cell type . IV . To explore development feed-back loop activation ( post-treatment biopsy biomarker analysis ) target inhibition use MK-2206 via analysis pre-treatment post-treatment biopsy select patient enrolled trial . V. To determine duration progression-free overall survival , follow initiation therapy MK-2206 . VI . To determine toxicity MK-2206 , assess revise NCI CTCAE version 4 . VII . To explore association select biomarkers response MK-2206 progression-free survival , objective tumor response . OUTLINE : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) weekly . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year .</detailed_description>
