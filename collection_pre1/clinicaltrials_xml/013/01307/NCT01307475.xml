	<brief_summary>Freeman-Sheldon syndrome ( FSS ) rare human neuromusculoskeletal disorder present birth , involve primarily limb craniofacial deformity . The hypothesis present study FSS related condition : ( 1 ) FSS related condition associate high rate posttraumatic stress symptom ( PTSS ) , depression , reduce quality life observe general population ; ( 2 ) person close individual FSS related condition suffer similarly ; ( 3 ) current measure , single-disease specific ( i.e. , PTSS , depression , craniofacial deformity , limb deformity ) , capture unique picture FSS related condition , involve limb craniofacial deformity intellectually capable individual . There study look quality life associate FSS . Some author look quality life person facial difference ; author look bone joint problem . Many author look PTSS depression cause health problem bad medical experience . No author look problem happen together , FSS . Because , may differences patient FSS versus patient previous quality life study . The study also develop validate outcomes-based quality life survey FSS related condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study research project initiate graduate research student ( Mikaela I. Poling ) assist clinical genetics fellow graduate student ( Andr√©s Morales ) partial fulfilment requirement Masters degrees Clinical Applied Physiology , approval , direction , supervision study PI ( Rodger J. McCormick ) . Mental Health Congenital Deformities : Apajasalo et al . ( 1998 ) find significantly decrease health-related quality life versus control among adult youth age chondrodysplasias . Differences adult score area mobility , usual activity , sexual activity discomfort . Youth score differ school hobby friends physical appearance . Didierjean-Pillet ( 2002 ) stress concern aesthetic reconstruction consideration psychiatric impact congenital deformity psychosocial functioning . Nagata et al . ( 2008 ) find 20 % mother child operate congenital disease likely post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . They find pro-active , effective participation child 's care may alleviate PTSS . Vitale et al . ( 2005 ) find quality life survey score among clubfoot patient compatible age-matched control , agreement Roye ( 2001 ) , correlate radiograph appearance . They advise quality life survey score primary endpoint determine therapeutic outcome . Engell et al . ( 2007 ) find significant post-operative improvement Short Form-12 Health Survey physical component scale congenital clubbed-foot patient Danish Twin Registry . Vitale et al . ( 2001 ) observe tailor quality life scale require paediatric orthopaedic population . Hawkins Radcliffe ( 2006 ) conclude lack appropriate validate PTSD measure paediatric patient . Part problem lacking validate paediatric PTSD measure likely non-comprehensive Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders IV Text-Revision criterion . Relevance Current Study : Because FSS-related deformity comprehensive , treatment-resistant , associated poor clinical outcome , quality life study include subset FSS patient may appropriate challenge clinical picture FSS-related deformity . In many condition , disorder-specific quality life measure ( QLM ) show increased sensitivity specificity general QLMs important therapeutic tool assess efficacy prioritise intervention . Results disorder-specific QLMs important predictor clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
