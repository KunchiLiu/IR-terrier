	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give vaccine therapy together without recombinant interleukin-12 follow daclizumab work treat patient melanoma spread place body . Vaccines make peptide antigen may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Recombinant interleukin-12 may kill tumor cell stop blood flow tumor stimulate white blood cell kill melanoma cell . Monoclonal antibody , daclizumab , may decrease number regulatory T cell ( T cell suppress activation immmune system ) may lead good immune response melanoma . It yet know whether vaccine therapy effective interleukin-12 daclizumab treat melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Without Recombinant Interleukin-12 Followed Daclizumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine admixture IL-12 ( recombinant interleukin-12 ) vaccine emulsion increase frequency vaccine-induced cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ T cell blood . II . To determine administration daclizumab deplete CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell peripheral potentiate specific immune response induce vaccination . III . To determine vaccination +/- daclizumab safe patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine vaccination +/- daclizumab clinical activity patient advance melanoma . II . To determine clinical response may associate particular gene expression profile tumor microenvironment . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive multipeptide vaccination comprise recombinant MAGE-3.1 antigen , MART-1 antigen , gp100 antigen , NA17-A2 peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 intradermically ( ID ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 22 , 50 . ARM II : Patients receive vaccination arm I admixture recombinant interleukin-12 ( IL-12 ) day 1 , 22 , 50 . In arm , patient evaluate immune response . Patients partial response stable disease may immunize maximum 1 year . Patients complete response may treat 1 additional course 3 vaccination . EXPANDED COHORT : Additional patient accrue arm high immune response receive daclizumab IV 15 minute day -7 . Patients receive vaccination arm I arm II day 1 , 22 , 50 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 8 week disease progression least every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
