	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give panitumumab , combination chemotherapy , radiation therapy together surgery work treat patient advanced esophageal gastroesophageal ( GE ) junction cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panitumumab , Combination Chemotherapy , Radiation Therapy Before Surgery Treating Patients With Advanced Esophageal Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pathologic complete response rate modify FOLFOX-6 regimen ( leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin ) give panitumumab two-week interval x 4 cycle combination external beam radiation therapy patient locally advance adenocarcinoma esophagus . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity ability complete plan treatment . II . To determine achieve steady-state plasma concentration 5-FU ( fluorouracil ) correlate clinical toxicity . III . To assess potential importance polymorphic variation genomic deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) pertinent gene whose protein product target anti-neoplastic drug use clinical protocol response toxicity therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive panitumumab intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 ( FOLFOX chemotherapy ) . Treatment repeat every 2 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 24 hour start chemotherapy , patient undergo radiation therapy 5 day week 5.5 week . Patients undergo surgery within 6-8 week completion chemotherapy radiation therapy . Patients residual disease receive 4 additional course FOLFOX chemotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
