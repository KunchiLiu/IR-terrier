We currently pilot data three session intervention design reduce psychological distress NICU parent . In phase hte study , plan augment intervention add additional three session total six session comprise new treatment manual . To accomplish , conduct comprehensive review content current empirically base cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) treatment PTSD , abstract key element , compare key element current treatment PTSD construct fourth session use combination Stress Inoculation Training technique ( include relaxation training , think stopping , cognitive restructuring ) imaginal re-exposure . A similar process use identify parent-child intervention currently available use premature vulnerable young child . The redefinition infant reeducation mother promote sensitivity toward attachment infant likely topic . 2 . PILOT THE MANUALIZED TREATMENT IN AN OPEN TRIAL WITH 10 NICU MOTHERS , SOLICIT FEEDBACK AND MODIFY INTERVENTION SESSIONS . To obtain clinically relevant feedback prepare unforeseen logistical issue , pilot six session treatment intervention 10 mother whose newborn hospitalize LPCH NICU . The recruited parent representative population mother intervention intend for-English Spanish speaking mother infant &gt; = 28 week , 1000 gram , bear LPCH transfer within 72 hour CRIB score , measure medical severity , 15 less . Children transfer cardiac surgery congenital abnormality eligible . Mothers approach member NICU staff within 72 hour infant 's admission NICU .

Following 6th session , mother contact study coordinator administer instrument choose post intervention assessment assess satisfaction treatment session . Specific question include : What like/dislike treatment ? ; Which sessions most/least helpful ? ; Could treatment structure differently ? ; Was timing/length session appropriate ? ; Were technique teach useful ? ; How satisfy intervention ? All evaluation material include change pre/post score instrument summarize present Scientific Advisory Group . Once consensus reach revise manual , manual rewritten incorporate feedback data obtain pilot study . 3 . CONDUCT A RANDOMIZED TRIAL OF THE TREATMENT INTERVENTION COMPARED TO AN INFORMATION , USUAL CARE , SUPPORT CONTROL CONDITION . Eligible mother ( N=100 ) randomly assign receive either : ( 1 ) manual driven , CBT-based trauma focus plus mother redefinition/education intervention ; ( 2 ) information , usual care/support . The intervention expect last 3 week two 45-55 minute session weekly . Participants condition assess baseline , within one week completion intervention 4-5 week control group 6-months post-baseline . The information/usual-care/support condition choose control possible symptom change due routine clinical contact common NICU , effect time , effect attention effect due repeat assessment . Parents information/usual care/support group receive one 45 minute information session policy , procedure environment NICU Neonatal Nurse Practitioner ( Table 4 ) . We choose use Nurse Practitioner information comparison role often assume LPCH . This session base LPCH Hospital Information Packet routinely distribute NICU parent , although generally without instruction face-to-face review content . Women group follow telephone NICU one week information session answer question may . In addition , mother refer exist parent mentor program support cop strategy . By add parent mentor support expect contact similar intervention group , thus , approximate attention-matched comparison condition . Mothers group also receive care typical NICU parent include contact nurse , physician , social worker , chaplaincy developmental psychologist . Thirty participant intervention arm randomize receive expand intervention 6 additional session ( session 7-12 ) . These session elaborate theme identify Session 4 follow current model PTSD treatment generally provide minimum 12 session . These session likely use cognitive restructuring address distortion NICU experience . Specific issue explore individualized parent may include parental guilt , parental anxiety infant 's medical health , difficulty relate perceived absence parental role . There also strong emphasis use stress inoculation training assist parent develop strategy manage trauma symptom . The 30 participant intervention arm randomize expand intervention offer contact exist parent mentor program . Parent mentor offer support , cop strategy suggestion normalize life NICU hospitalization .
