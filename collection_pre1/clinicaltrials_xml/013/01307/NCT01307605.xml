	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer cell growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Lenalidomide may stop growth non-Hodgkin lymphoma block blood flow cancer . It yet know whether rituximab effective give alone together lenalidomide treat patient follicular lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study rituximab see well work compare give rituximab together lenalidomide treat patient previously untreated follicular lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab With Without Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine activity rituximab combination lenalidomide versus rituximab alone patient previously untreated follicular lymphoma need therapy . Secondary - To determine safety regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord grade disease ( grade 1 2 v 3a ) , presence bulky disease ( defined mass ≥ 6 cm ) ( yes v ) , Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index score ( 1 2 v ≥ 3 ) , participate center . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm A : Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 week 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 week 12 , 13 , 14 , 15 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm B : Patients receive rituximab IV arm A . Patients also receive oral lenalidomide daily , start 14 day first rituximab administration last 14 day last rituximab administration , absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . All patient undergo restaging week 10 . Patients show less minimal response ( i.e. , reduction 25 % sum product diameter [ SPD ] ) study treatment transfer follow-up phase . Patients undergo second restaging week 23 . Some patient may undergo biopsy blood bone marrow sample collection periodically biomarker study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 20 year .</detailed_description>
