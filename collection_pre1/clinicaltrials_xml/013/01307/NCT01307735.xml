	<brief_summary>Myocarditis inflammatory heart disease primarily viral origin lead heart failure death . Despite unfavorable long-term outcome mortality rate high 50 % , classification , diagnosis , treatment myocarditis remain controversial . The gold standard clinical diagnosis direct sample heart muscle , often miss infected area thus reliability test questionable . While cause clinical presentation myocarditis often unclear , inflammation heart muscle clearly image Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( CMR ) . Due recent international consensus CMR protocol myocarditis unique ability CMR visualize cardiac structure , function , characterize tissue , CMR become primary tool clinical assessment . This study aim test accuracy CMR diagnosis myocarditis validate whether CMR acquire early stage myocarditis provide incremental prognostic information . In order effectively gather relevant clinical data , online , multi-centre international registry establish across twenty different medical institution . Hypotheses : 1 . CMR accurately detect active myocardial inflammation patient myocarditis 2 . CMR acquire early clinical stage myocarditis provide incremental prognostic information superior standard clinical diagnostic tool .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Rationale Because unique combination morphological functional imaging tissue characterization , cardiovascular magnetic resonance ( CMR ) become non-invasive diagnostic tool choice assess myocarditis . Recently , standard diagnostic CMR criterion myocarditis propose ( `` Lake Louise Criteria '' ) , base signal intensity pattern T2-weighted image T1-weighted image contrast administration 3 . There however lack prognostic data use criterion . Furthermore , clinical utility criterion real-life scenario well understood . The aim study evaluate diagnostic CMR criterion prediction functional outcome quality life patient myocarditis . Background : Myocarditis Myocardial inflammation , often cause myocardial involvement systemic viral illness , although typically benign outcome , may result persist myocardial damage . Clinical outcome include heart failure death . Chronic myocarditis progress dilate cardiomyopathy result dilation decompensation one ventricles result heart failure , need cardiac transplantation . Diagnostic approach myocarditis The diagnosis myocarditis generally consider exclusion cause acute heart disease establish combination history , physical examination non-invasive invasive test . History clinical examination precede diagnostic test although initial onset myocarditis often insidious , symptoms non-specific , clinical sign absent . ECG finding , ST change , AV block arrhythmia may associate myocarditis , although sensitivity limit . Serological biomarkers myocardial injury creatine kinase troponin may increase ; however , prevalence increase troponin T biopsy-proven myocarditis limit , likely due lack extensive necrosis many case . Endomyocardial biopsy ( EMB ) usually consider gold standard definitively diagnose myocarditis . In 1986 , group pathologist define EMB criterion diagnosis myocarditis , know `` The Dallas Classification System '' . This classification suggest minimum three , recommend five separate biopsy specimens take accurate pathological analysis . A major limitation technique invasive , mortality rate 0.4 % certain contraindications9 . Myocardial injury cause viral infection could also focal distribution , EMB may able detect . Only 10 25 % patient clinically suspect myocarditis confirm diagnosis EMB11 . High interobserver variability interpretation EMB , associate sampling error , clinical value technique question . Indium-111 ( 111In ) -antimyosin antibody ( AMA ) scintigraphy use specific antibody target damage myocytes , thus , able detect vivo necrosis . A major drawback technique , however , differentiate different etiology myocardial necrosis . It also suitable detect inflammation absence cell death . Prognostic value diagnostic marker There paucity data prognostic value various diagnostic tool . LV dysfunction consider important indicator worse outcome myocarditis . In recent study , however , LV dysfunction infrequently observed3 ; therefore , marker may helpful clinical scenario , especially less severe case persist symptom despite preserved cardiac function . Background : Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance ( CMR ) Hallmark feature acute myocarditis interstitial lymphocytic infiltration edema hyperemia , myocardial necrosis3 . Interestingly , readily identify CMR non-invasive approach , use combination non-contrast Gadolinium-enhanced technique . CMR offer several advantage , oppose diagnostic modality . It use radiation harmful contrast agent , field view limit tissue characterization combine functional assessment ventricle session . The first clinical study use contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging patient acute myocarditis show CMR suitable tool detect myocardial inflammation show spread tissue change focal diffuse myocardial involvement . Based previous pilot data , group introduce T2-weighted CMR image acute myocarditis specific marker myocardial edema . Areas Gd accumulation CMR image acquire late contrast administration ( `` Late enhancement '' ) reflect irreversible injury report 60 % report myocarditis case . The diagnostic sensitivity comprehensive CMR protocol 67 % , specificity 91 % diagnostic accuracy 78 % , exceed diagnostic approach . As sub-clinical myocarditis also immune response phenomenon , speculate CMR parameter use diagnose acute myocarditis also relevant image sub-clinical myocarditis . CMR increasingly accept emerge standard diagnostic test myocarditis . Prognostic CMR data myocarditis Follow-up data CMR myocarditis still scarce . In pilot study , Wagner et al . study evolution relative enhancement early course disease month patient myocarditis compare 26 healthy patient . They demonstrate myocardial contrast enhancement decrease normal value many patient within follow-up 30 month . In 2/19 patient , leave ventricular function recover . Interestingly , contrast enhancement day 28 predictive ejection fraction clinical outcome 30 month . More recently , Zagrosek et al . provide CMR follow-up data 36 patient 18±10 month myocarditis . They demonstrate acute phase , T2 ratio relative enhancement elevate patient ( 86 % 80 % respectively ) significantly decrease follow-up , associate improvement clinical leave ventricular function parameter . Late enhancement present 22 patient ( 63 % ) persist 21/22 patient . The acute phase T2 ratio correlate significantly change end-diastolic volume . The predictive value CMR marker inflammation ( hyperemia , edema ) necrosis/fibrosis , however , know , especially compare LV function presentation . Study Objectives 1 . The primary objective compare CMR criterion myocarditis presentation LV volumetric functional outcome marker acquire follow-up CMR study patient diagnostic CMR criterion myocarditis control group . 2 . Secondary objective compare compare CMR criterion myocarditis presentation quality life 12 month presentation group . Study Variables 1 . CMR Criteria Myocarditis ( `` Lake Louise Criteria '' ) Evidence myocardial inflammation present least 2 3 CMR criterion positive . These include : - Early Gd enhancement ratio equal great 4.0 ; - regional global T2 signal intensity ratio equal great 2.0 ; - least one focus late enhancement . 2 . LV function - Ejection fraction , - LVEDV , - LVESV , - LVEDVI , - LVESVI , - Stroke volume , - Cardiac index , - End-systolic wall stress 3 . Quality life quantify standardized questionnaire Study Design Patients refer CMR study Stephenson Cardiovascular MR Centre suspect myocarditis screen . Patients CMR-derived evidence myocarditis ( i.e . least two positive Lake Louise Criteria least one CMR scan clinically acute phase disease ) consider `` myocarditis-positive '' . As control group , patient refer suspected myocarditis fulfil diagnostic CMR criterion myocarditis normal systolic LV function . Both group receive standard protocol per Consensus Group recommendation . Follow-up perform 4 8 week initial episode 1 year . Data include CMR result quality life assessment quantify standardized questionnaire . Subjects Recruitment 1 . Inpatients identify study nurse collaboration supervise cardiologist 2 . Outpatients Cardiology clinic Imaging protocol All CMR imaging perform 1.5T MRI system ( Avanto® , Siemens Medical Solutions , Erlangen , Germany ) , use 32-channel cardiac phase array coil functional late enhancement image body coil T2-weighted image early Gd enhancement image .
