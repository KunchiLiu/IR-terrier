	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis patient suffer chronic destruction lung , frequent finally chronic pneumonia reduce life expectancy . Unfortunately , curative treatment cystic fibrosis available , neither treatment establish prevent disease . Our data identify ceramide potential novel target treat cystic fibrosis . Two small trial support notion inhibition acid sphingomyelinase amitriptyline improve lung function CF-patients even dose low enough avoid adverse effect . In present proposal investigator , therefore , aim test large cystic fibrosis patient population whether inhibition ceramide release lung cause lack functional CFTR improve lung function cystic fibrosis patient . Inhibition ceramide-release lung achieve treatment amitriptyline , use anti-depressant drug almost 50 year . Although absolutely specific , seem relatively specific degradation acid sphingomyelinase ( typically 60-80 % cellular acid sphingomyelinase degrade ) , release ceramide sphingomyelin . If data confirm beneficial effect amitriptyline already observe preliminary study , present clinical study may establish novel treatment improve clinical symptom cystic fibrosis , moreover , prevent least delay onset cystic fibrosis . Hypothesis - Amitriptyline reduces ceramide concentration respiratory epithelial cell ( measure nasal epithelial cell obtain brush nasal mucosa ) . - Amitriptyline treatment reduces cell death bronchus deposition DNA respiratory epithelium , permit elimination P. aeruginosa lung ( measure P. aeruginosa count tracheal fluid ) . - Amitriptyline treatment result normalization function leukocyte ( number determine serum tracheal fluid ) - Amitriptyline reduces systemic local inflammation ( measure cytokine plasma tracheal fluid ) . Based effect amitriptyline increase lung function cystic fibrosis patient ( measure FEV1 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anti-inflammatory Pulmonal Therapy Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) Patients With Amitriptyline Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , common autosomal recessive disorder least western country , cause mutation cystic fibrosis transmembranous conductance regulator molecule ( CFTR ) affect approximately 40 000 patient Europe . Most , , CF-patients develop chronic pulmonary infection Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa ) . At present , unknown CF-patients highly sensitive P. aeruginosa infection , importantly , curative treatment cystic fibrosis available . Our study provide novel pathophysiological concept cystic fibrosis . The investigator demonstrate ceramide play crucial role development cystic fibrosis high sensitivity Cftr-deficient mouse infection P. aeruginosa ( 1,2 ) . Using biochemical technique , fluorescence microscopy , mass spectrometry , investigator find ceramide accumulate lung various Cftr-deficient mouse strain infection occurs , particular epithelial cell large small bronchus alveolar macrophage . The accumulation ceramide Cftr-deficient epithelial cell may mediate increase pH 4.5 6.0 secretory lysosome pre-lysosomes Cftr-deficient cell . The change pH result reduction approximately 90 % activity acid ceramidase consumes ceramide , reduction 35 % activity acid sphingomyelinase release ceramide . An imbalance activity two enzyme , relative over-activity acid sphingomyelinase produce ceramide , may result accumulation ceramide . Partial inhibition acid sphingomyelinase , either genetically pharmacologically , return ceramide concentration near normal level lung Cftr-deficient mouse . Genetic inhibition acid sphingomyelinase achieve cross Cftr-deficient mouse acid sphingomyelinase-deficient mouse create mice deficient Cftr heterozygous acid sphingomyelinase ( Cftr-/-/Smpd1+/- mouse ) . The activity acid sphingomyelinase lung mice approximately 50 % low lung wild-type mouse . Pharmacological inhibition acid sphingomyelinase achieve treat Cftr-deficient mouse functional acid sphingomyelinase inhibitor amitriptyline ( 1,2 ) . Increased concentration ceramide bronchial epithelial cell Cftr-deficient mouse trigger death cell , deposition DNA bronchus , chronic pulmonary inflammation , high susceptibility Cftr-deficient mouse pulmonary infection P. aeruginosa . Normalisation ceramide concentration genetic mean normalise change , pharmacological inhibition acid sphingomyelinase prevent change . Ceramide accumulation also observe ciliated nasal epithelial cell , macrophage lung transplant material CF patient ( 1-4 ) . This finding suggest result murine study also apply human cystic fibrosis . Next , investigator apply panel functional inhibitor acid sphingomyelinase treat Cftr-deficient mouse inhalation amitriptyline , trimipramine , desipramine , chlorprothixene , fluoxetine , amlodipine , sertraline , functional inhibitor acid sphingomyelinase . This inhalation reduce activity acid sphingomyelinase specifically lung normalised pulmonary ceramide concentration , inflammation , susceptibility infection ( 2 ) . Recent finding C. Ward associate confirm accumulation ceramide lung specimen CF patient ( 5 ) . Clinical data : 1 . Pilot study - Based amitriptyline-mediated protection Cftr-deficient mouse , investigator initiate small clinical cross study 4 cystic fibrosis patient treat amitriptyline placebo , respectively . The result reveal clinical relevant increase lung function ( determined FEV1 ) cystic fibrosis patient treatment amitriptyline 2 week . 2 . Phase IIa - The positive data pilot study encourage u initiate Phase IIa cross study 18 patient investigate beneficial effect amitriptyline cystic fibrosis large patient population prove safety , biochemically prove mechanisms action , dose find amitriptyline ( 25 mg/day , 50 mg/day , 75 mg/day ) . Amitriptyline well-tolerated patient group SAEs record end 28-day-course . From 80 AEs , 35 relate possibly related medication . Two well-known AEs amitriptyline , i.e . xerostomia tiredness , significantly different placebo three amitriptyline treatment group , mostly transient . FEV1 analyse per protocol analysis 13 , 7 , 8 8 available patient cycle , receive placebo , 25 mg , 50 mg 75 mg amitriptyline/day , respectively . After 14 day treatment primary endpoint FEV1 improve significantly 25 mg/d amitriptyline group relative placebo ( FEV1 : +5.0 % compare placebo group ; p = 0.048 ) . No significant change lung function observe patient administer 50 mg 75 mg amitriptyline ( 6 ) . 3 . Phase IIb - To evaluate positive data phase IIa-trial , investigator initiate phase IIb study 2009 parallel group design .</detailed_description>
