	<brief_summary>N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) surrogate neuronal marker proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H MRS ) signal decrease increase neuronal mortality associate cerebral hypoxia-ischaemia . The MRS lactate ( Lac ) /NAA peak-area ratio increase severe cerebral hypoxia-ischaemia reflect mitochondrial injury impair oxidative phosphorylation . Aims : ( 1 ) To establish normative range thalamic 1H MRS NAA concentration Lac/NAA healthy newborn infant ( 2 ) To examine accuracy thalamic 1H MRS NAA concentration Lac/NAA predict adverse neurodevelopmental outcome neonatal encephalopathy ( NE ) Design : Prospective observational study Methods : Year 1 : Following 1H MRS methodology optimisation 40 healthy control infant recruit collect normative data . Year 2 3 : 115 infant NE , undergo therapeutic hypothermia recruit . MRS perform age less 4 day 7 14 day thalamic NAA level Lac/NAA quantify ; Qualitative interview evaluate parental understanding biomarker . Year 4 , 5 : Outcome assessment BSID III 18 month . Outcomes : Mean thalamic NAA level Lac/NAA appropriate confidence interval normal infant , thalamic NAA level Lac/NAA infant NE accord neurodevelopmental outcome . Areas curve thalamic NAA Lac/NAA examine separately early &amp; late MRS . Accuracy early MRS inform utility investigation decision withdrawal life support ; late MRS inform efficacy surrogate end point clinical trial .

	<detailed_description>2 . 1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To examine accuracy 1H MRS thalamic [ NAA ] predict adverse neurodevelopment infant NE undergo therapeutic hypothermia 2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVE 2.2.1 To examine inter intra-center variability thalamic [ NAA ] level healthy adult volunteer 2.2.2 To develop normative range 1H MRS thalamic [ NAA ] quantitative measure potential utility healthy term newborn infant 2.2.3 To compare prognostic accuracy 1H MRS thalamic [ NAA ] MRS quantity Lactate/NAA peak-area ratio acquire early ( age ≤ 4 day ) acquire late ( age 5 14 day ) 2.2.4 To examine parental attitude towards MR use decision withdrawal life support counsel long term outcomes 3 . METHODS Prospective observational study ; index test ( 1H MRS ) gold-standard test ( neurological outcome 18 month ) perform independently blind . 3.3 Recruitment Control infant recruit postnatal ward participate hospital . The MR scan perform infant first discharge hospital far possible ( example follow Caesarean delivery ) i.e . within first week life . A lead research midwife identify participate hospital approach parent recruitment inform consent . NE infant recruit neonatal intensive care unit . MR scan perform twice inform parental consent . The first scan less 4 day age ( clinically feasible ) second scan 5 14 day age . The first scan perform infant still intensive care unit participate centre . At time second MR scan , likely baby would ventilator . Sedation would use required baby . 3.4 Neurodevelopmental evaluation Neurodevelopmental outcome assess 18 month age use Bayley Scale Infant Development® ( Version 3 ) blind MRS information . Favourable outcome define survival without disability , disability define : developmental quotient ( DQ ) &gt; 84 ( BSID III ) , neuromotor impairment ( neurological exam score ≥73 Gross Motor Function Classification System ( GMFCS ) ≤I ) [ 19 ] , normal vision hear clinical examination . Unfavourable outcome define death , survivor , moderate severe disability . 3.5 Post-mortem evaluation If infant dy ( UCH case ) , parent give option conventional autopsy minimally invasive autopsy ( MIA ) Great Ormond Street Hospital ( GOSH ) use protocol establish MaRIAS ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging Autopsy Study ) [ 20 ] . 3.6 Qualitative interview About 6 month death discharge parental sub group 20 NE case recruit stratified purposeful sample Royal Victoria Infirmary ( Newcastle ) invite participate interview psychology Research Fellow . The parental understanding , attitude towards use , MR technique predict long term outcome make decision withdrawal life support ( hospital stay ) , collect thematically analyse ( aim 2.2.3 ) . Tape record transcript parental interview analyse emerge theme group . 4 . ENDPOINTS AND DATA ANALYSIS 1H MRS thalamic [ NAA ] ( mean ( SD ) ; mmol/kg wet weight brain tissue ) NE infant compare outcome . Sensitivity specificity 95 % CI area curve ( Standard Error ) report [ NAA ] Lac/NAA peak-area ratio clinical significance unit change measure term unit change motor cognitive outcome score examine . The prognostic accuracy early acquisition 1H MRS compare late acquisition use area curve diagnostic odds ratio . The accuracy [ NAA ] prediction outcome compare conventional MRI . 1H MRS thalamic [ NAA ] ( mean ( SD ) ) healthy term infant report .</detailed_description>
