	<detailed_description>Background : Dr. Duffy develop , test , refine efficacious , nurse-administered Tobacco Tactics intervention package Toolkit dissemination two Veterans Affairs ( VA ) hospital . However , rigorous test dissemination outside VA need . Objectives : Using 6 community hospital Trinity Health System , objectives study : 1 . Determine provider patient receptivity , barrier , facilitator implement nurse-administered , inpatient Tobacco Tactics intervention versus usual care use face-to-face feedback survey . 2 . Compare effectiveness nurse-administered , inpatient Tobacco Tactics intervention versus usual care across hospital , unit , patient characteristic use biochemically confirm 7-day point-prevalence abstinence 6-month cessation primary outcome . 3 . Determine cost-effectiveness nurse-administered , inpatient Tobacco Tactics intervention versus usual care include cost per quitter , cost per life-year save , cost per quality-adjusted life-year save . Methods : This effectiveness study cluster randomize control trial 6 Michigan community hospital 3 get nurse-administered Tobacco Tactics intervention 3 provide usual care accordance hospital responds current Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organization 's ( JC ) standard . A research nurse disseminate intervention 3 6 site Master Trainers teach staff nurse shift unit , staff nurse train . The intervention become standard care within intervention site . Research nurse also conduct roll evaluation identify barrier facilitator dissemination implement measure ensure sustainability intervention .

Descriptive statistic ( mean frequency distribution ) use summarize nurse ' survey result , participation rate , smoker ' receipt specific cessation service , satisfaction service . Logistic regression t-tests used determine difference intervention group satisfaction quit rate , respectively , adjustment clustering patient within unit hospital . Regression analyse test moderation effect intervention patient characteristic confidence ability quit , nicotine addiction , alcohol intake , depression , demographic smoke related diagnosis heart disease . Cost-effectiveness assess construct 3 ratio include cost per quitter , cost per life-year save , cost per quality-adjusted life-year save .</detailed_description>
