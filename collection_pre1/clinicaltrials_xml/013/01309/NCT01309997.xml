	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial evaluate well imatinib mesylate work compare rituximab treat cutaneous sclerosis patient chronic graft- versus-host disease ( GVHD ) .

	<brief_title>Imatinib Rituximab Treating Cutaneous Sclerosis Patients With Chronic Graft-Versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine best clinical response rate cutaneous sclerosis ( skin and/or fascial thickening ) 6 month initial therapy either imatinib ( imatinib mesylate ) rituximab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine best response either 3 6 month assessment . II . To determine response rate 3 month assessment . III . To determine proportion subject able taper corticosteroid 6 month imatinib rituximab therapy . IV . To determine incidence treatment failure initial treatment either imatinib rituximab . V. To evaluate Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire ( SHAQ ) finding correlate severity cutaneous sclerosis clinical finding response study treatment . VI . To correlate detection antibody platelet derive growth factor receptor alpha ( PDGFR A ) clinical response . VII . To correlate change B cell relevant parameter baseline 6 month early crossover ( antibody level , skin collagen expression , B cell subset ) therapeutic agent best clinical response initial treatment . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive imatinib mesylate mouth ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 6 month absence progression sclerosis unacceptable toxicity . Subjects significant clinical response continue receive study drug additional 6 month . ARM II : Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ( first cycle ) . A second cycle treatment rituximab repeat 3 month total 8 dos rituximab absence progression sclerosis unacceptable toxicity . Patients progression , treatment intolerance time 6 month , clinical response 6 month crossover treatment arm .</detailed_description>
