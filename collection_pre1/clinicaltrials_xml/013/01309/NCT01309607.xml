	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety weekly paclitaxel carboplatin , combination lapatinib , neoadjuvant treatment non-metastatic erbB2-positive breast cancer . Secondary objective include : - To determine safety tolerability weekly paclitaxel carboplatin , combine lapatinib , Asian population - To determine breast conservation rate follow neoadjuvant paclitaxel/ carboplatin/ lapatinib - To determine clinical response rate relapse-free survival patient treat neoadjuvant paclitaxel/ carboplatin/ lapatinib - To identify predictive tumour biomarkers pathologic complete response The investigator hypothesize pathologic complete response rate improve 15 % 35 % neoadjuvant regimen carboplatin/ paclitaxel/ lapatinib compare standard chemotherapy alone HER2 positive early stage breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Preoperative Weekly Paclitaxel Carboplatin With Lapatinib ( Tykerb® ) Patients With ErbB2-Positive Stage I-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Pathologic complete response follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy show independent , strong predictor disease-free overall survival operable breast cancer - The addition neoadjuvant trastuzumab chemotherapy result 2-3 fold increase pCR rate operable ErbB2-positive breast cancer - Lapatinib explore alternative trastuzumab large clinical trial operable ErbB2-positive breast cancer - In randomised phase III adjuvant trial , BCIRG 006 , non-anthracycline chemotherapy ( docetaxel carboplatin ) show effective conventional sequential anthracycline-containing chemotherapy docetaxel , combination trastuzumab , improve cardiac safety - Weekly paclitaxel show randomized phase III study optimal adjuvant taxane regimen - Weekly paclitaxel carboplatin , combination lapatinib , demonstrate safety efficacy Phase I/II clinical study metastatic breast ovarian cancer - The investigator aim assess efficacy non-anthracycline contain regimen , weekly paclitaxel carboplatin , combination lapatinib induce pCR neoadjuvant treatment ErbB2-positive non-metastatic breast cancer . The investigator hypothesize combination achieve pCR rate least 35 %</detailed_description>
