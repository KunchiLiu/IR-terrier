	<brief_summary>Clostridium difficile bacteria infect colon cause severe diarrhea patient recent antibiotic use . The current standard care treatment severe C. diff . consist oral vancomycin and/or intravenous metronidazole . When treatment unsuccessful , lead need removal entire colon even death . In fact , mortality rate literature range 11-37 % C. diff . The commonly quote mortality rate 14 % severe infection . It believe failure treatment may stem adynamic ileus ( paralysis small bowel ) . This ileus may prevent oral vancomycin reach colon therefore treat problem . Vancomycin function direct contact colon . It presume paralysis small intestine present never proven . The objective study prove adynamic ileus present c. diff colitis therefore lead investigation improve treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients intensive care unit eligible participate study A pregnancy test check applicable . Patients enrol consented study give 300ml water contain 5 millicurie ( mCi ) technetium-99m ( Tc-99m ) diethylenetriamine pentaacetate ( DTPA ) . This nuclear tracer/water mix either drank orally place nasogastric tube begin study . The patient nothing else eat drink duration study . The patient nuclear scan perform 2 , 4 , 6 hour ingestion nuclear tracer . The image 2 6 hour take nuclear medicine department 4 hour image take ICU . The 2 6 hour study must conduct nuclear medicine department allow special equipment use . This equipment necessary allow computer calculation make . The 4 hour scan check progress tracer require calculations/measurements . Therefore , mobile scanner utilized . The image take 60 second . The image obtain interpreted nuclear medicine department determine transit time tracer stomach terminal ileum cecum . The data obtain subject compare previously obtain data normal subject . A normal study define 40 % tracer reach terminal ileum 6 hour . Any time longer 6 hour deem abnormal study delay small bowel transit time .</detailed_description>
