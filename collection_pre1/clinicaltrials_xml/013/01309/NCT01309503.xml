	<brief_summary>The main purpose study estimate speech intelligibility noise . A Norwegian Hearing Noise Test ( HINT ) child implement , test result normal hearing ( NH ) child adult collect . Test result group hear aid ( HA ) user test result cochlea implant ( CI ) user collect compare NH group group HA user CI user . A group single side hearing loss patient also include . Binaural benefit two ear , two HAs two CIs estimate .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria different group : 1 . Normal hear group ( note subject already recruit normal hear group ) : audiometric threshold less equal 25 dB HL octave frequency 250 Hz 8000 Hz Adults age 18 50 year Children different age group 6 12 year old 2 . Unilateral hearing loss group Singlesided hearing loss . Using hear aid willing try hearing aid side hearing loss estimate potential binaural benefit hearing aid . Unilateral hearing loss inclusion criterion threshold within 25 dBHL 70 dBHL frequency { 125,250,500 } Hz . Inclusion region increase linearly octave frequency 40 dBHL 95 dBHL frequency 8000Hz . In addition single threshold outside hear threshold inclusion region accept . Contralateral normal hear audiometric threshold less equal 25 dB HL octave frequency 250 Hz 8000 Hz 3 . Group Severe hear loss high frequency Inclusion criterion bilateral hearing loss within hear level frequency 750 Hz normal elevate 65 dBHL , frequency 1000 Hz 1500 Hz HL threshold accept , frequency 2000 Hz threshold criterion 85 dBHL . 4 . Adult CI user unilateral bilateral CI All adult patient test level performance . HINT SRTs collect HINT score quiet 70 % . 5 . Bilateral CI user ( Children ) 1 . Sequential CIs group Children get two CIs two different operation , operation within one year . Inclusion patient participate another ongoing sequential CIstudy ENT department , HINT score 70 % quiet . The requirement quiet percentage score 70 % due bilateral benefit testing/estimation . 2 . Simultaneous CIs group All child get two CIs operation sequentially within one year . Children old 6 year old . Children young 5.5 year old include consider ready extend HINT testing .</criteria>
