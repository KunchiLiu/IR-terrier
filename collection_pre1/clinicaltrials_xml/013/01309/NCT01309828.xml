	<brief_title>Long-Term Safety Azilsartan Medoxomil Chlorthalidone Compared Olmesartan Medoxomil Hydrochlorothiazide Participants With Hypertension Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major component blood pressure regulation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system ( RAAS ) . Drugs modulate RAAS use commonly worldwide treatment hypertension . TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) prodrug TAK-536 ( azilsartan ) , angiotensin II receptor blocker ( ARB ) . Azilsartan medoxomil evaluate Takeda treat participant essential hypertension . Chlorthalidone orally administer thiazide-like diuretic agent , long-term outcome trial show blood pressure reduction associate chlorthalidone treatment reduce risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Hypertensive patient moderate renal impairment relatively severe resistant hypertension population , may benefit effective fixed-dose combination treatment ARB plus diuretic blood pressure control . Participants randomize receive azilsartan medoxomil chlorthalidone olmesartan medoxomil hydrochlorothiazide 52 week evaluate long term safety azilsartan medoxomil chlorthalidone . A titration-to-target blood pressure approach use guide titration study medication trial .</detailed_description>
