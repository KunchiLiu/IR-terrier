( Note : patient Stage IIIc ovarian cancer additionally evaluate subset use descriptive statistic ) . Patients receive 1.0 x 10^7 cell / intradermal injection gene transfected autologous tumor cell , Vigil™ month 12 dos long sufficient material available . Enough harvest tissue provide minimum 4 monthly injection require entry study . Hematologic function , liver enzymes , renal function electrolyte monitor monthly . Immune function analysis include ELISPOT analysis cytotoxic T cell function autologous tumor antigen monitor ( ≤24 hour ) tissue harvest , ≤24 hour first cycle chemotherapy ( post debulking ) , ≤24 hour third cycle chemotherapy ( post debulking ) , baseline ( screen ) , prior Vigil™ injection Months 2 , 4 , 6 EOT . The date last dose chemotherapy administration Vigil™ vaccine # 1 record . Treatment continue disease recurrence exhaustion patient 's vaccine supply . If ≥ Grade 2 toxicity NCI Common Toxicity Criteria ( exclude Grade 2 fever ≤ 24 hour Grade 2 3 injection site reaction ) develop related study treatment vaccine dose reduce 50 % continue monthly basis . If single patient develop ≥ Grade 3 toxicity ( injection site reaction ) relate study treatment trial place hold reevaluation design discussion FDA . During hold , new subject initiate dosing , subject already dose may continue dose schedule deem clinically appropriate PI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite gradual improvement overall survival past decade , approximately 75 % woman Stage IIIC ovarian cancer achieve complete clinical response relapse 50 % achieve pathologic complete response median time 18-24 month . Phase III study maintenance consolidation therapeutic intervention translate overall survival advantage . Preliminary study immunotherapy patient ovarian cancer suggest target accessibility ( potential immunogenicity ) immune mediate approach . In effort overcome limitation immunostimulatory cancer vaccine , design novel autologous whole cell vaccine , Vigil™ , incorporate rhGMCSF transgene bifunctional shRNA^furin ( block proprotein conversion active TGFb1 b2 ) 1 ) address inability fully identify cancer associate antigen , 2 ) effect antigen recognition immune system ( i.e . antigen→immunogen ) , 3 ) enhance effector potency , 4 ) subvert endogenous cancer-induced immune resistance . A Phase I assessment Vigil™ vaccine 33 advance solid tumor patient ( 1 pediatric patient 15 year age ) receive ≥1 vaccination ( dose 1.0 x 10^7 2.5 x 10^7 cells/injection/month maximum 12 vaccination ) demonstrate safety Vigil™ vaccine . Furthermore , proof principle establish manufactured vaccine increase mean GMCSF expression post-transfection 1135 pg/10^6 cells/ml knockdown furin , TGFb1 TGFb2 78 % , 93 % , 95 % , respectively ) . In addition , although Phase I study , data suggest overall survival benefit .</detailed_description>
