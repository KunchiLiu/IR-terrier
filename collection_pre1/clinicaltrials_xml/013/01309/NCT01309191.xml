	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Minoxidil treatment affect hair growth patient male pattern baldness androgenetic alopecia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microarray Analysis Scalp Biopsies After Minoxidil Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The common type hair loss androgenetic alopecia ( AGA ) , also know male pattern balding , hereditary thinning . In AGA , gradual transformation large terminal hair follicle miniaturize one influence circulate androgen produce small finer hair short anagen cycle . This transformation , see early prepubescent year , occur certain region scalp : frontal hairline , top vertex scalp . The temporo-occipital region largely unaffected even extensive balding . The first drug approve FDA treatment AGA topical minoxidil solution ( TMS ) . Despite successful use , mechanism action TMS well understood . Minoxidil potent vasodilator potassium channel opener , mechanism action promote hair regrowth appear independent vasodilation property . Improved knowledge change gene expression associate AGA treatment TMS compare placebo may lead great understand underlying mechanisms action TMS . Furthermore , potential identification patient would best respond benefit treatment .</detailed_description>
