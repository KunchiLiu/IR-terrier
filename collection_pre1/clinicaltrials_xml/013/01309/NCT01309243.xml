	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy emtricitabine ( FTC ) /rilpivirine ( RPV ) /tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) single-tablet regimen ( STR ) compare efavirenz ( EFV ) /FTC/TDF STR HIV-1 infect adult previously receive treatment antiretroviral medication . Participants randomize 1:1 ratio receive one study treatment . Randomization stratify HIV-1 RNA level ( ≤ 100,000 copies/mL &gt; 100,000 copies/mL ) screening . A treatment duration 96 week plan , option subject FTC/RPV/TDF STR arm receive treatment follow Week 96 visit FTC/RPV/TDF STR commercially available Gilead Sciences elect terminate development country .</brief_summary>
