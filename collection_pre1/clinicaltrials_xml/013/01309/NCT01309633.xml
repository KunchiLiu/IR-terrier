	<brief_summary>Aims : Primary objectives - To determine pathological complete response ( CR ) * rate intermittent sunitinib administer combination cisplatin gemcitabine systemic therapy locally advanced systemic NPC . - To determine safety tolerability intermittent sunitinib administer combination cisplatin gemcitabine systemic therapy locally advanced systemic NPC . Secondary objectives - To determine clinical response rate ( RR ; complete partial response ) + intermittent sunitinib administer combination cisplatin gemcitabine systemic therapy locally advanced systemic NPC . - To evaluate pharmacodynamic effect ( image , circulate tissue ) intermittent sunitinib administer combination cisplatin gemcitabine systemic therapy locally advanced systemic NPC . - To compare early pharmacodynamic effect ( image , circulate tissue ) load dose 12.5mg 25mg sunitinib 7 prior administration systemic cisplatin gemcitabine chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients may include study meet follow criterion : Male female patient age 21 year . Patients histologically confirm WHO Type II III NPC . Tumour stage III , IVA ( T4 N02 M0 ) IVB ( Any T N3 M0 ) IVC ( Any T Any N M1 ) accord American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) 2010 criterion . Alternatively , patient locally advanced recurrent metastatic NPC systemic chemotherapy indicate eligible . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . Adequate organ function include follow : a.Bone marrow function i.Haemoglobin = 9g/dl ii.Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) = 1.5 x 109/L iii.Platelet count = 100 x 109/L . b.Liver function i.Bilirubin &lt; = upper limit normal ( ULN ) ii.Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) gammaglutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ) &lt; = 2.5x ULN iii.Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &lt; = ULN iv.Prothrombin time ( PT ) within normal range institution . c.Renal function i.Plasma creatinine within normal range institution calculate creatinine clearance ( CockcroftGault formula ) &gt; 60mL/min . d.Serum amylase lipase &lt; = 1.5x ULN . Life expectancy least 3 month . Recovery previous drug procedurerelated toxicity National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( NCICTCAE ) version 4.0 Grade 0 1 ( except alopecia ) , baseline precede prior treatment . Signed informed consent obtain study specific procedure . Subjects must able understand willing sign write informed consent . Patients exclude study follow reason : Previous concurrent anticancer chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy investigational therapy . Patients swallow patient chronic gastrointestinal disease condition may hamper compliance and/or absorption test product . Any concomitant condition could compromise objective study and/or patient 's compliance ( eg . severe medical condition uncontrolled infection , poorly control diabetes mellitus , hypercalcaemia , psychiatric disorder ) . Major thoracic and/or abdominal surgery precede 3 week . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) seropositivity , hepatitis B C seropositivity . In investigator 's opinion , patient current previous history clinically significant liver disease within previous 2 year . History cardiac disease : congestive heart failure &gt; New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II ; active coronary artery disease ( unstable angina [ anginal symptom rest ] newonset angina [ begin within last 3 month ] myocardial infarction within past 6 month ) . Cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy ( ÃŸblockers digoxin permit ) . Uncontrolled hypertension ( failure diastolic blood pressure fall 90 mmHg , despite use = 3 antihypertensive drug systolic blood pressure great 150 mmHg ) . Dehydration NCICTCAE Grade 2 high . Subjects serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture . Subjects arterial venous thrombotic embolic event cerebrovascular accident ( include transient ischemic attack ) , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism within 6 month start study medication . Subjects renal impairment ( creatinine clearance CockcroftGault formula ) = 60mL/min ) dialysis . Persistent proteinuria NCICTCAE Grade 3 high ( &gt; 3.5 g/24 hour , measure urine protein/creatinine ratio random urine sample ) .

Subjects seizure disorder require anticonvulsant medication . History organ allograft . Subjects evidence history disorder coagulation thrombosis . Pregnancy breastfeed . Women childbearing potential employ adequate contraception . Women childbearing potential must pregnancy test perform maximum 7 day start study medication , negative result must document start study medication . Women childbearing potential men , must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method birth control ) upon sign informed consent form least 3 month last study drug administration . The definition adequate contraception base judgment treat investigator designate associate . Substance abuse , medical , psychological social condition may interfere subject 's participation study evaluation study result . Known suspect allergy investigational agent agent give association study . Any condition unstable could jeopardize safety compliance subject study . Previous concurrent cancer distinct primary site histology cancer evaluate study EXCEPT cervical carcinoma situ , treat basal cell carcinoma , superficial bladder tumor ( Ta , Tis &amp; T1 ) cancer curatively treat &gt; 3 year prior study entry . Interstitial lung disease ongoing sign symptoms time screening .</criteria>
