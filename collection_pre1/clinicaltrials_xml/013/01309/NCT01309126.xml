	<brief_title>Study Imprime PGG® Combination With Cetuximab Subjects With Recurrent Progressive KRAS Wild Type Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study BT-CL-PGG-CRC1031 Phase 3 , open-label , randomize , multi-center study . Qualified subject , KRAS WT colorectal cancer randomize 2:1 ratio either : Arm 1 : Imprime PGG cetuximab Arm 2 : Cetuximab Approximately 795 subject randomize study . Dosing occur 6-week cycle . Imprime PGG dose 4 mg/kg administer weekly cycle ( Weeks 1-6/Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 ) precede administration cetuximab ( Arm 1 ) . The initial cetuximab dose ( arm ) 400 mg/m2 Cycle 1/Day 1 subsequent dos 250 mg/m2 administered weekly cycle ( Weeks 1-6/Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 ) . Subjects dose progressive disease ( PD ) per RECIST 1.1 discontinuation study drug reason ; e.g. , safety . Following completion treatment period study , subject monitor survival death loss follow-up . Tumor measurement determination tumor response evaluate accord RECIST 1.1 . Safety , PK , quality life , biomarker parameter also assess .</detailed_description>
