	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate conversion rate base number participant achieve pain control safety within 1 week switch opioid ( morphine-like medication ) analgesic ( drug use control pain ) , tapentadol extended-release ( ER ) ( JNS024ER ) orally administer participant treat around-the-clock opioid analgesic , moderate severe ( serious , life threaten ) chronic ( last long time ) malignant ( cancerous ) tumor-related ( mass specific area ) cancer ( abnormal tissue grow spread body ) pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Oral Tapentadol Extended-Release Japanese Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , open-label ( medical research study participant researcher tell treatment participant receive , `` unblinded '' ) , parallel-arm ( participant receive 1 2 possible intervention time frame throughout study ) , optimal dose-titration , multicenter ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) study evaluate conversion rate base number participant achieve pain control safety within 1 week switch ongoing around-the-clock opioid analgesic ( morphine sustained-release [ SR ] , oxycodone controlled-release , fentanyl transdermal ) tapentadol ER morphine SR , moderate severe chronic , malignant tumor-related cancer pain . The study consist 2 period : 1 2 week screening period , follow 8-week open-label treatment period . During study period , participant hospitalize outpatient . However , preferable hospitalize 1 week 1 week evaluate efficacy switch opioids secure participant ' safety . At Day 1 , participant receive either tapentadol ER morphine SR twice daily . During treatment period , dose study drug titrate participant 's optimal dose . The participant receive either tapentadol ER morphine SR twice daily 8 week . The maximum dose allow tapentadol ER 500 milligram ( mg ) daily morphine SR 140 mg daily throughout study . Efficacy primarily evaluate use pain intensity score 11 point Numerical Rating Scale ( 11-point NRS use measure pain level 0=no pain 10=pain bad imagine ) . Participants ' safety also monitor .</detailed_description>
