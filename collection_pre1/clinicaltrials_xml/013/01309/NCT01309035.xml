	<brief_summary>Introduction : Approximately 7000 total knee replacement ( TKAs ) do every year . More 90 % knee replacement perform use bone cement . Traditionally , tourniquet , use reduce bleed surgery , enable surgeon perform delicate dissection bloodless operative field . A tourniquet define constrict compress device use control temporarily venous arterial circulation extremity . Pressure apply circumferentially skin underlie tissue limb . This pressure transfer wall vessel , cause become occlude . It well known apply tourniquet 1 2 hour associate number disadvantage , instance , severe pain muscle effect first postoperative day , thereby slow rehabilitation . Other side effect relate tourniquet use , include pulmonary embolus cause venous thrombosis arterial thrombosis result dislodgement arterial plaque . Furthermore , tourniquet-induced hypertension general anaesthesia , muscle injury , wide spectrum neurologic injury , tissue change ( Oedema compartment syndrome , post-tourniquet syndrome ) report . An important fact bleed affect quality bind bone cement thereby fixation knee prosthesis ? Since introduction modern cement technique , previous clinical study investigate advantage disadvantage tourniquet use knee replacement surgery . Aims/hypothesis study : 1 . To investigate advantage disadvantage tourniquet use , include whether use tourniquet reduces pain , facilitate mobilisation recovery , shorten length stay . 2 . To study whether use tourniquet affect leg muscle surgery , measure use microdialysis quantify level ischemia . 3 . To determine whether prosthesis fixation , measure RSA , affect tourniquet use . Because third generation cement secure prosthesis fixation , investigator expect find clinically significant migration ( le 2 mm ) 2 year surgery . Perspectives : The investigator hope result study improve rehabilitation regimes patient experience less pain surgery thus achieve rapid mobilisation return daily life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design Patients able participate study fulfill give inclusion criterion : - Patients symptomatic radiographic verify knee symptom , select primary unilateral total knee joint replacement ( TKA ) - Age 50 ( old 85 ) - BMI &lt; 35 height &gt; 160 cm - No severe cardiovascular condition - No previously knee surgery do knee - Oral write acceptance A group concern 2 x 30 patient randomize two group . Either intervention group , absence tourniquet control group tourniquet . Which group belong , blind patient surgeon reach operation room . The operation perform usual , exception two additional procedure . During operation small spheric tantalum pellet place around prosthesis . Furthermore patient prepared microdialysis , contain placement 3 catheter : one thigh one subcutaneously abdomen . Microdialysis unique technique monitor chemistry extracellular space living tissue . It primarily use In Vivo determination endogenous metabolite , thus serve indicator ischemia . RSA precision radiology small pellet visual x-ray . Using computer 3D image create pellet serve marker . These marker measure every 6 month show whether possible migration prosthesis occur thereby indicate loosen . Out-patient treatment Patients among thing follow clinical functional score , registration analgetica use , conventional X-ray RSA In long run perspective surgery concern knee replacement conduct without use tourniquet thereby reduce pain patient without compromise end result operation , namely fixation prosthesis . Permissions approve Regional Committee Biomedical Research Ethics , Region Northern Jutland Danish Data Protection Agency .</detailed_description>
