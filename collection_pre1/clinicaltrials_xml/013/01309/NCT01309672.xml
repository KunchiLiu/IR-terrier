	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Antiandrogen drug , abiraterone acetate , may lessen amount androgen make body . It may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study side effect well abiraterone acetate work treat patient prostate cancer undergone initial hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1014 Abiraterone Acetate Treating Patients With Prostate Cancer Who Have Undergone Initial Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess rate achieve prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) ≤ 0.2 ng/mL abiraterone acetate therapy men metastatic prostate cancer sub-optimal response androgen-deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . Secondary - To assess overall survival objective progression-free survival group patient . - To assess PSA partial response . - To evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity abiraterone acetate . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive abiraterone acetate orally daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive androgen blockade GNRH agonist ( goserelin acetate leuprolide acetate ) GNRH antagonist ( degarelix ) per treat physician give continuously evidence disease progression . Bilateral surgical orchiectomy also acceptable . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
