	<brief_summary>Inadequate identification subsequent delay therapy patient hypoperfusion ( include hypovolemia , congestive heart failure sepsis ) common problem face physician intensivists care critically ill patient . Bedside clinical assessment notoriously inaccurate diagnosing complex etiology hemodynamic disturbance decide appropriate therapy . Invasive technique often require guide diagnosis therapy significant risk associate , costly , time consume . New technology develop allows instantaneous , noninvasive monitoring key hemodynamic parameter , like stroke volume , peak velocity cardiac output . This new technology potential improve recognition etiology hemodynamic disturbance assist clinician optimize therapy base change hemodynamic parameter . There significant potential translate improved outcome critically ill patient , never study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Optimization By Non-Invasive Determination Of Cardiac Output In Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients life-threatening hypotension commonly care intensive care unit ( ICUs ) . Pathophysiologic perturbation due disease state sepsis , hypovolemia , congestive heart failure may lead tissue hypoxia , critical development precedes multi-organ failure death . Not difficult rapidly identify patient head path , execution effective hemodynamic resuscitation slow reverse process challenge . A cornerstone hemodynamic resuscitation volume administration . The goal volume administration maximize cardiac output , thereby systemic oxygen delivery , optimize cardiac preload . Bedside clinical assessment inadequate judge whether goal achieve . Invasive technique , central venous pressure ( CVP ) monitoring pulmonary artery catheterization , carry risk , costly time-consuming , may yield mislead data . Doppler ultrasound-based technology develop allows instantaneous , non-invasive monitoring key hemodynamic parameter , cardiac output . This technology may facilitate determine etiology hemodynamic disturbance assist clinician optimize therapy base change hemodynamic parameter . This randomize , control trial design determine impact volume resuscitation protocol , guide non-invasive Doppler ultrasound technology , outcomes medical ICU patient vasopressor-dependent hypotension . Materials method : Patient Population : Study participant recruit January 19 , 2010 December 26 , 2010 two medical ICUs Barnes-Jewish Hospital , 1252-bed urban teach hospital . The Washington University School Medicine Human Research Protection Office approve study , inform consent obtain participant authorized representative . Inclusion criterion age ≥18 year ; administration vasopressor , define continuous infusion norepinephrine dose &gt; 5 mcg/min , dopamine ≥5 mcg/kg/min dose another vasopressor ; passage &lt; 18 hour since initiation vasopressor dose specify . Exclusion criterion hemorrhagic shock , need immediate surgery , imminent risk death next 48 hour ( judge attend ICU physician ) , level care decision preclude implementation study protocol , enrollment clinical study , pregnancy . Study Protocol : Subjects assign treatment group use blocked randomization receive either volume resuscitation guide ultrasound cardiac output monitor ( USCOM ; USCOM Ltd. , Sydney , Australia ) observation . The USCOM non-invasive device use continuous-wave Doppler ultrasound measurement blood flow ascend aorta pulmonary artery estimate stroke volume ( SV ) . Prior begin study , one study investigator ( LMD ) underwent supervise training period USCOM 50 patient insure reproducibility obtain measurement . Subjects randomize intervention group underwent baseline USCOM measurement SV single operator ( LMD ) , follow pressurize infusion 1 L normal saline ( NS ) approximately 15 minute , SV measurement repeat . If SV increase ≥15 % , patient deem volume-responsive , another 1 L NS bolus administer . This process repeat SV increase ≥15 % , two hour elapse since study enrollment , 4 L NS infuse , whichever occur first . With exception initial fluid management intervention group , describe , use diagnostic treatment modality discretion ICU physician . Subjects control group underwent intervention ; ongoing care carry discretion ICU physician . ICU physicians unaware subject ' group assignment USCOM data acquire intervention group .</detailed_description>
