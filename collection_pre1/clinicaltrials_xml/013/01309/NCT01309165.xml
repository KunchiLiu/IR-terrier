	<brief_title>Exploring Efficacy Combined Task-Specific Cognitive Strategy Training Subacute Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Activity participation limitation occur majority living effect stroke . Novel stroke rehabilitation approach , task-specific training ( TST ) , show promise improve recovery component basic mobility activity daily live ; however , evidence suggest improvement generalize transfer home , community , work setting , usually impact overall participation outcome . Further , treatment intense , total treatment time high 30 60 hour , make clinically economically unfeasible many setting . In contrast , approach incorporate cognitive strategy train show great promise improve functional activity performance people live stroke , also facilitate generalization transfer beyond clinical setting , 10 to15 treatment hour . Cognitive Orientation daily Occupational Performance ( CO-OP ) establish treatment approach use cognitive strategy combination TST . Cognitive strategy learn strategy goal direct derived cognitive executive function initiation , planning , error detection , support early mid phase skill acquisition . TST base principle motor learning , optimal provision feedback practice schedule , involve repetitive practice specific task , skill , activity . Research investigator lab demonstrated CO-OP associate functional skill acquisition , retention , generalization transfer skills beyond rehabilitation set adult one year post-stroke . Evidence research group finding participant interview data indicate approach may even effective introduce much early rehabilitation process , however , CO-OP yet test sub-acute population . Therefore , specific project goal : 1 . To refine CO-OP treatment approach use people less three month post stroke ; 2 . To evaluate , Phase II clinical trial , preliminary efficacy refine protocol compare TST alone immediate longer-term skill performance participation ; 3 . To determine effect size power calculation future Phase III clinical trial test new protocol vs. contemporary treatment . The research approach consist Part 1 , Protocol Refinement , Part 2 , Exploratory Phase II Clinical Trial . Part 1 address first project goal refine CO-OP use people less three month post stroke . In Part 1 , three four adult , less three month post stroke , recruit . The CO-OP protocol iteratively modify necessary base experience participant , treat therapist ' log , treatment outcome data , research team consensus . Part 2 , Exploratory Phase II Clinical trial Control Arm , address second third project goal . Part 2 make use treatment protocol refinement Part 1 . Based data study chronic patient , estimate sample size 28 patient , 14 per group , provide 82 % power detect treatment difference 1.3 unit Canadian Occupational Performance Measure ( COPM ) , standard deviation 1.15 . The main study outcome change performance quality train untrained skill , measure participant-rated COPM observer-rated Performance Quality Rating Scale ( PQRS ) ; change participation , measure Participation Domain Stroke Impact Scale ( SIS ) . Data analysis consist descriptive statistic between- within-group difference . Variability outcome measure couple estimate clinically meaningful effect size conduct sample size calculation future Phase III clinical trial . As well , data informative feasibility examine , recruitment rate , attrition , mean number session complete , treatment satisfaction rating . The innovation proposal enhance stroke rehabilitation important long-term functional participation stroke outcomes efficient mechanism add cognitive strategy use exist TST-based program . The significance high , stroke high risk decline participation increase resource utilization .</detailed_description>
