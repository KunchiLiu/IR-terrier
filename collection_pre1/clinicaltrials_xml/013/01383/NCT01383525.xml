	<brief_title>Direct Application Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty Using `` DIO-DENT 10 '' Open Angle Glaucoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Number patient : An enrollment approximately 25 patient plan treated Direct application Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty . This single site outpatient study assess safety &amp; efficacy TSLTP laser ( TSLTP ) ) ( `` DIO-DENT 10 '' DENTAL DIODE LASER SYSTEM ) ability reduce IOP patient open angle glaucoma . 20 patient enrol study . The investigational site accrue patient uncontrolled open-angle glaucoma . These eye treat direct application Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty ( TSLTP ) . Only one eye per patient treat study interval 3 month . Thereafter treatment fellow eye may do per medical judgment investigator . Subjects evaluate preoperatively postoperatively 1 hour , 2 hour ( hourly 4 hour event IOP elevation immediate postoperatively course ) , 1 day , 1 week , 1 , 3 , month . The interval evaluation equivalence two trabeculoplasty procedure 6 month . Patients follow 3 month . Investigational Device The TSLTP laser , `` DIO-DENT 10 '' DENTAL DIODE LASER SYSTEM flash-lamp-excited solid-state laser emit near infrared 790 nm . It use perform either direct application Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty conjunctiva trabecular Meshwork ( TM ) . The laser slit-lamp delivery system combine form system focus treatment beam onto conjunctiva . An aim beam , coincident treatment beam , use direct placement treatment beam onto conjunctiva . Pressing footswitch delivers treatment beam form short pulse energy approximately 8 u duration . Study Procedures Evaluations Operative Procedure Only one eye per patient treat study 6 month interval . The treat physician use his/her medical judgment determine eye treat base current IOP general ocular visual status patient 's treat eye fellow eye . Topical anesthesia administer eye treat prior treatment . DSALT use , aim beam place TM . Patients treat TSLTP laser ( 790 nm ) 360 degree arc , 100 spot . The energy level use determined patient patient basis base threshold need achieve effect tissue . Placement spot , inferior , superior , temporal nasal document . Immediately follow laser treatment , Diclofenac drop administer continued treat eye four time daily four seven day . Preoperative Postoperative Procedures Evaluations A schedule preoperative postoperative procedure evaluation provide Table B. Preoperative Procedures Evaluations The variability IOP patient monitor two consecutive week treatment begin . The examination first screen visit conduct two six week treatment include full ophthalmic examination eye , consist follow : - Two reading IOP applanation . - Determination best correct visual acuity . - Slit-lamp examination anterior segment . - Conjunctival injection ( 0-4+ ) - Cornea appearance - Iris lens appearance - Anterior Chamber Cell Flare ( 0-4+ ) - Gonioscopy grade degree pigmentation quadrant . - Evaluation angle opening . - Evaluation presence posterior anterior synechiae ( PAS ) . - Lens examination . - Determination ratio optic disc cupping . - Fundus examination . - Visual field examination ( could perform within 6 week treatment , include day treatment ) . - Recording current glaucoma medication ( type dosage ) . - Recording date time last administration list glaucoma medication . Patient demographic information ( sex , race , date birth ) medical history include previous ocular surgery also record . At least four day elapse initial second screening examination . The follow assess recorded eye : - Date time evaluation . - Results two reading IOP applanation . - Current glaucoma medication ( type dosage ) . - Date time late administration list glaucoma medication . Finally , follow assess recorded eye immediately treatment begin . - Results two reading IOP applanation . - Best correct visual acuity . - Glaucoma medication ( number , type , dosage ) . - Date time late administration list glaucoma medication . Postoperative Observations Follow-Up Immediately follow treatment , two reading IOP treat eye assess record least 2 hour postoperatively . The IOP continue monitor hourly basis IOP rise *5 mmHg immediate preoperative IOP . If necessary , elevate IOP treat appropriate increase anti-glaucoma medication administration additional medication record . The presence level cell anterior chamber record hourly examination . Any immediate postoperative complication complaint record . The IOP management medication maintain throughout treatment post-treatment follow-up interval . Any anti-glaucoma medication regimen adjustment need instituted record . At examination day follow treatment , well subsequent schedule unscheduled examination , physician technician measure IOP blind regard eye receive TSLTP . At visit , follow assess record : - IOP applanation eye . - Glaucoma medication ( type dosage ) . - Date time last administration list glaucoma medication . - Slit-lamp examination anterior segment treat eye . - Conjunctival injection ( 0-4+ ) - Anterior chamber cell flare ( 0-4+ ) - Iris lens appearance - Cornea appearance At Weeks 1 4 follow assess record : - IOP applanation eye . - Best correct visual acuity eye . - Glaucoma medication ( type dosage ) . - Date time last administration list glaucoma medication . - Slit-lamp examination anterior segment treat eye . - Conjunctival injection ( 0-4+ ) - Anterior chamber cell flare ( 0-4+ ) - Iris lens appearance - Cornea appearance At Months 3 follow assess recorded eye : - Two reading IOP applanation . - Best correct visual acuity . - Glaucoma medication ( type dosage ) . - Date time last administration list glaucoma medication . - Slit-lamp examination anterior segment : - Conjunctival injection ( 0-4+ ) - Anterior chamber cell flare ( 0-4+ ) - Iris lens appearance - Cornea appearance - Gonioscopy grade degree pigmentation quadrant . - Evaluation angle opening . - Evaluation presence PAS . - Lens examination . - Determination ratio optic disc cupping . - Fundus examination . - Visual field examination . - Recording current glaucoma medication ( type dosage ) . - Recording date time last administration list glaucoma medication . Additional frequent follow-up evaluation could perform investigator 's request . Safety Efficacy Variables Criteria evaluation : Efficacy : Primary Efficacy Endpoint : The primary efficacy endpoint percentage reduction IOP 6 month postoperative preoperative medicate IOP . The mean percentage reduction IOP assess . Secondary Efficacy Endpoints The following efficacy endpoint compare two treatment group . - Postoperative IOP 3 , 6 12 month - Absolute reduction percentage reduction IOP 3 , 6 12 month preoperative medicate IOP - The relationship preoperative medicate IOP change IOP 3 , 6 , 12 month follow treatment . Safety : Safety determine frequency tabulation adverse event complication follow : - Acute elevation IOP *10 mmHg immediate preoperative measurement either treat non-treated eye . - Mild moderate anterior chamber inflammation treat eye , include iritis , cell flare . - Any following treated eye : - transient blurred vision ; - discomfort ; pain - deterioration visual field ; - mild hemorrhage - loss 2 line BCVA , associated procedure Safety also determine evaluate change baseline follow TSLTP treatment ocular characteristic - cell flare , - visual acuity , - disc cup disc ratio All patient enrol treated study evaluate safety .</detailed_description>
