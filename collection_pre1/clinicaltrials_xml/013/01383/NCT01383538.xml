	<brief_title>FOLFIRINOX Plus IPI-926 Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic adenocarcinoma ( PDAC ) represent fourth lead cause cancer-related mortality United States , estimate 36,800 death attributable PDAC 2010 . ( 1 ) Over 90 % patient inoperable disease presentation , point systemic therapy become primary form treatment . Single agent gemcitabine become standard care advance pancreatic cancer decade ago since demonstrate improve survival compare fluorouracil . Since , number phase III trial evaluate benefit add additional cytotoxic target agent gemcitabine , show table . The PA.3 trial ( 2 ) , lead approval erlotinib advance pancreatic cancer , landmark study represent first positive phase III study combination regimen disease indication ; however , erlotinib represent important proof principle welcome addition therapeutic armamentarium , fail gain significant traction disease , many oncology community consider marginal absolute improvement median overall survival questionable clinical significance . FOLFIRINOX : A new standard care advance PDAC ? At 2010 American Society Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting ( ASCO ) , French cooperative group present result potentially practice-changing phase III clinical trial ( PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 ) . ( 18 ) In study , 342 patient previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer randomize receive either gemcitabine monotherapy combination biweekly infusional 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin , irinotecan , oxaliplatin ( FOLFIRINOX ) ( ref ) . The investigator report statistically significant improvement FOLFIRINOX arm primary endpoint , overall survival ( median 11.1 month vs 6.8 month , P &lt; .0001 ) ; well 1-year survival rate ( 48.4 % vs. 20.6 % ) , median progression-free survival ( 6.4 vs. 3.3 month ; P &lt; .0001 ) , objective response rate ( CR+PR , 31.6 % vs. 9.4 % ; P = .0001 ) ) . Not surprisingly , complex FOLFIRINOX regimen associate high rate grade 3/4 toxicity , include neutropenia ( 45.7 % vs 18.7 % ) , febrile neutropenia ( 5.4 % vs. 0.6 % ) , fatigue ( 23.2 % vs. 14.2 % ) , diarrhea ( 12.7 % vs. 1.2 % ) . Notably , primary prophylaxis growth factor support mandate trial , 42.5 % patient ultimately receive support . Moreover , patient enrol trial non-pancreatic head tumor ( approximately 64 % ) opposite distribution one might expect representative pancreatic cancer population . Thus , conceivable FOLFIRINOX regimen , high rate neutropenia , may lead unacceptable rate infectious complication ( eg , ascend cholangitis biliary sepsis ) , patient pancreatic head tumor indwell endobiliary stent . Nevertheless , strikingly positive survival benefit , median overall survival approach one year purely metastatic cohort , never observe previous study , raise question whether FOLFIRINOX become newly adopt standard care , least patient preserve performance status ( patient trial require ECOG performance score 0-1 ) . HEDGEHOG SIGNALING The Hedgehog ( 19 ) signal pathway important normal mammalian embryonic development adult tissue remodeling . Recent report demonstrate aberrant activation Hh pathway associate many type cancer , include basal cell carcinoma ( BCC ) , medulloblastoma , pancreatic adenocarcinoma , small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , metastatic prostate cancer , glioma , breast cancer , hepatocellular cancer , hematologic malignancy . High level Hh pathway activation , either mutation pathway component constitutive expression Hh pathway gene , appear involve initiation cancer tumor cell survival , well tumor growth metastasis . Given therapeutic potential Hh pathway inhibition cancer , Infinity develop IPI-926 , potent specific antagonist Hh pathway bind Smoothened ( Smo ) , key signal transmembrane protein pathway , thereby diminish downstream promoter cellular proliferation . Pancreatic adenocarcinoma ideal tumor class evaluate activity Hh pathway inhibitor , multiple line evidence support role Hedgehog signal pancreatic tumorigenesis : - Aberrant expression Sonic hedgehog ( SHH ) associate signal component ( patch ( PTC ) smoothen ( SMO ) ) frequently find pancreatic cancer specimen . ( 20-27 ) - Pharmacologic inhibition hedgehog signal produce antitumor effect pancreatic cancer cell lines27 orthotopic xenograft model . ( 28,29 ) Studies involve global sequencing analysis identify pathway one central element undergo transformation nearly pancreatic cancer . ( 21 ) - Hedgehog signaling may play important role maintenance pancreatic cancer stem cell . ( 30-32 ) - The dense desmoplastic mesenchymal network constitute stroma pancreatic adenocarcinoma couple poor vascularity may present major challenge effective delivery intravenous chemotherapy bulk pancreatic tumor cell burden . Recent evidence genetically engineer mouse model pancreatic cancer demonstrate IPI-926 deplete tumor-associated stromal tissue increase intratumoral mean vessel density , result enhanced delivery concurrently administer systemic agent gemcitabine , decreased tumor burden , prolong survival .
