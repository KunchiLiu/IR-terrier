	<brief_summary>The specific aim current study : 1 ) To determine prevalence IDNA sample female rower begin training season ; 2 ) To determine IDNA affect endurance train performance begin train season ; 3 ) To determine iron supplementation affect iron status , train performance IDNA female collegiate rower . The researcher hypothesize IDNA affect endurance performance female collegiate rower outside laboratory , iron supplementation IDNA rower improve iron status , consequently , train quality via increase energetic efficiency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>How Does Iron Supplementation Affect Training Performance Female Collegiate Rowers ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron deficiency ( ID ) common nutrient deficiency United States , affect 13 % pre-menopausal woman , approximately 30 % physically-active woman ( 1 , 2 ) . Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) clinically define hemoglobin ( Hgb ) less 12.0 g/dl . Iron depletion without anemia ( IDNA ) , low iron store , define Hgb great 12.0 g/dl serum ferritin ( sFer ) less 20.0 µg/L . Female athletes high risk IDNA due menstrual status , poor dietary intake , high training volume intensity ( 3 ) . Consequences IDNA may relevant athlete include reduced work capacity , endurance , energetic efficiency ( 4-6 ) ; increase local muscle fatigue ( 7 ) . The mechanism IDNA affect endurance physical performance remain unclear , functional consequence IDNA fully understand trained individual , study examine relationship underpowered ( 8 , 9 ) . Our lab previously report effect iron deficiency physical performance untrained , IDNA woman adapt aerobic training program . Hinton et al ( 5 ) show effect iron supplementation physical performance mediate change iron status ( sFer ) , conclude IDNA reduce potential benefit aerobic train endurance . In study , subject supplement iron 6 week aerobic train improved time complete 15-km cycling time trial 3.4 min compare 1.6 min placebo group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Given convincing result , study highly-trained competitive female athlete train high volume intensity warrant . We expect significant effect persist competitive collegiate athlete . However , expect magnitude effect somewhat less due collegiate athlete ' advance training status , thus small margin improvement performance due response increase body iron store . The goal propose study determine whether marginal iron deficiency ( IDNA ) impair ability moderately- highly-trained female collegiate rower increase train quality , well performance response 6 week iron supplementation , addition usual endurance training . This study conduct three phase . Phase 1 cross-sectional study design describe iron status diverse sample female collegiate rower around central New York state . Iron status screen venous blood sample , demographic health self-reported performance data also collect . One-hundred sixty-five female collegiate endurance athlete screen identify IDNA subject ( sFer &lt; 20 µg/l , Hgb &gt; 12 g/dL ) iron supplementation trial . Phase 2 cross-sectional study design measure compare metabolic functional consequence ID sample highly-trained female rower across broad range fitness level ( novice varsity ) iron status ( normal , ID , IDNA ) . This cross-sectional study analysis baseline data potential RCT participant ( IDNA ) begin train season . In addition IDNA subject participate supplementation trial , include sample non-anemic , non-iron deficient rower . These subject complete baseline protocol lab , record one week training activity , addition baseline data collect . This cross-sectional study enable u investigate potential relationship iron status early training season performance . This plausibility analysis useful , light putative mechanism ( correlation iron status physical performance ) , explain iron status may affect physical performance . These analysis suggest relationship iron status performance , provide strong causal evidence , temporal relationship iron status performance determine cross-sectional study . We , however , need identify control confound factor relate iron status performance control bias . Phase 3 randomize , placebo-controlled supplementation trial design explore IDNA iron supplementation affect iron status , performance , train 6-weeks row training . Rowers normal iron status include study examine training effect ( ) iron status performance . This study design elucidate cause-effect relationship ( ) iron status ( iron supplementation ) , train performance .</detailed_description>
