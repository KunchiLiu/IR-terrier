	<brief_summary>This Phase IIb/III randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study compare efficacy safety first-line therapy combine TG4010 placebo stage IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . TG4010 suspension recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus strain Ankara ( MVA strain ) carry cod sequence human MUC1 antigen human interleukin-2 ( IL2 ) . TG4010 develop use immunotherapy cancer patient whose tumor express MUC1 antigen . TG4010 intend induce MUC1-specific cellular immune response produce non-specific activation several component immune system .</brief_summary>
