	<brief_title>Sirolimus Gold Sodium Thiomalate Treating Patients With Advanced Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) ATM ( gold sodium thiomalate ) plus sirolimus . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe adverse event profile associate treatment combination . II . To preliminarily evaluate response rate , time progression , progression-free survival overall survival patient treat treatment combination . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tumor biomarkers protein kinase C ( PKCι ) mammalian Target Of Rapamycin ( mTOR ) signal activity predictor response ATM/sirolimus therapy . II . To evaluate use surrogate biomarkers PKCι mTOR inhibition peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBLs ) monitor response ATM/sirolimus therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive sirolimus orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 gold sodium thiomalate intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
