	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen high low risk healthy asymptomatic Veterans Affairs ( VA ) patient promote . Compliance Directive result increase number VA patient undergo colonoscopy . The demand colonoscopy far exceed capacity available perform procedure VA system . The conventional practice colonoscopy VA facility across country perform colonoscopy conscious sedation air insufflation . Efficiency govern fact sedate patient require time space recovery major limit factor current setting use colonoscopy CRC screening . In prospective , randomize , control trial ( RCT ) , two method perform colonoscopy compare patient undergo unsedated colonoscopy CRC screening . We compare water infusion lieu air insufflation ( water method ) conventional air insufflation method . We hypothesize water method ( Study method ) increase overall cecal intubation comparable assessment current experience patient willingness repeat future colonoscopy compare conventional colonoscopy . In addition , water method improve bowel preparation increase polyp pickup rate .</detailed_description>
