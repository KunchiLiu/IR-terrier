	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) asthma common disorder Hong Kong , prevalence least 4 % among middle-aged male Hong Kong ( HK ) Chinese population 7.2 % young adult respectively . OSAS characterize repetitive episode upper airway obstruction , cause intermittent hypoxia , sleep fragmentation , disable daytime sleepiness , impaired cognitive function poor health status . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) first line therapy sleep apnea . CPAP provide pneumatic stent upper airway , eliminate airway collapse inspiration . Asthma chronic inflammatory disorder airway , characterize airway hyperresponsiveness lead recurrent episode wheezing , breathless , chest tightness , cough , particularly night early morning . Nocturnal asthma different condition asthma define variable worsen asthma night , mechanism completely understood . It may drive circadian rhythm circulate hormone epinephrine , cortisol , melatonin neural mechanism cholinergic tone . An increase airway inflammation night report . This might reflect reduction endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanism . Other factor propose possible cause overnight bronchoconstriction interruption bronchodilator treatment , allergens bedding , airway cool , supine posture , gastroesophageal reflux ( GER ) . Prevalence OSAS asthma : The prevalence OSAS asthmatic patient yet study , several study report increased prevalence OSAS symptom asthmatic patient . Large epidemiologic study demonstrate asthma patient frequently report snore . In longitudinal study , asthma independent risk factor development snoring . OSAS symptoms highly prevalent clinic-based population well-characterized asthma patient . Polysomnography reveal high frequency OSAS ( 88 % 95.5 % ) patient difficult-to-control asthma . Common risk factor contribute OSAS asthma : OSAS asthma share common risk factor . Fifty percent obese Caucasian population OSAS , among OSAS , 40 % obese . However , community study sleep-disordered breathe middle-aged Chinese men Hong Kong , average body mass index ( BMI ) habitual snorer 25.1 kg/m2 OSAS 27kg/m2 , make contribution obesity OSAS less important western counterpart . Apart obesity , prevalence GER increase patient OSAS . It suggest obesity contributes risk factor OSAS GER . However , OSAS patient exhibit significantly GER member average population even one control alcohol intake BMI . GER occur sleep well-known trigger nocturnal asthma provoke asthma symptom vagal reflex induce exposure esophagus acid . OSAS-induced acid reflux may play causative role trigger asthma symptom . Another possible etiology high prevalence OSAS symptom asthmatic patient increase incidence nasal obstruction asthmatic patient . The nose preferred breathe route sleep , nasal obstruction contributes sleep disordered breathing predisposed individual . Rhinitis chronic sinusitis common condition may cause nasal congestion consequently contribute upper airway obstruction OSAS . The effect CPAP treatment asthma control : CPAP treatment show prospective clinical study positive impact asthma outcome patient concomitant OSAS . Although important , study include small number participant use nonrandomized design . We hypothesize OSAS contribute symptom related nocturnal asthma CPAP therapy would improve asthma symptom , airway hyperactivity quality life patient nocturnal asthma OSAS . We aim assess ( 1 ) asthma control , airway responsiveness , daytime sleepiness , cognitive function health status baseline 3 month nasal CPAP treatment among asthma patient nocturnal symptom OSAS ; ( 2 ) acceptance compliance nasal CPAP treatment .</detailed_description>
