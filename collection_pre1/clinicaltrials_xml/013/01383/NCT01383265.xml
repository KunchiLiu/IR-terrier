	<detailed_description>Background : Warm water infusion lieu air insufflation ( water method ) improve overall success screen colonoscopy retrospective data indicate high adenoma detection rate . Dye spray method improve neoplastic polyp detection target stain pancolonic chromoendoscopy describe . Aim : In RCT screen colonoscopy subject , determine chromoendoscopy use dilute solution Indigocarmine ( IC ) deliver water method ( study method ) improve adenoma detection rate compare water method plain water alone ( control method ) . Methods : After informed consent patient undergo screen colonoscopy randomize examine study control method . Study method employ 0.008 % IC solution . Control method employ plain water . The water method study control group apply previously describe . The colonoscopy perform sedation . Primary outcome measure : adenoma detection rate ; secondary outcome : relevant procedure-related variable .</detailed_description>
