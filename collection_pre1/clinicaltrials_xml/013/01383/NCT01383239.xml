	<brief_summary>Rotator cuff tear see 40 % subject age 50 57 , prevalence know increase decade life 51 . Each year rotator cuff disorder lead 4.5 million physician visit , 40,000 inpatient surgery , 250,000 outpatient surgery cost $ 17,427 per patient 2004 . As population age , number rotator cuff repair surgery increase ; New York State , rotator cuff repair increase 50 % 5 year span 48 . Unfortunately , surgically repair rotator cuff tear fail least 20 % 94 % individual 3 , 9 , 13 , 20 , 28 , 40 , 52 , 58 . While many non-modifiable variable associate failure repair , postoperative rehabilitation modifiable variable receive little attention . The investigator propose multicenter randomize control trial study one important strategy postoperative rehabilitation : early versus delay onset physical therapy . This pilot study enroll patient isolated supraspinatus tear undergo standard surgical repair technique . The investigator hypothesize delay onset physical therapy improve heal patient outcome . Our primary outcome variable Western Ontario Rotator Cuff ( WORC ) Index ( disease specific validate outcome measure ) . Because outcome measure may always correlate heal rotator cuff repair 50 , secondary outcome measure heal base MRI scan 12 month surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgically repair rotator cuff tear fail surprisingly high rate , approach 20-94 % determine MRI 3 , 9 , 13 , 20 , 28 , 40 , 52 , 58 . Non-modifiable variable associate rotator cuff repair failure include : duration symptom 9 , 19 , 39 , fatty infiltration atrophy muscle 6 , 15 , 17 , large rotator cuff tear 6 , 9 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 26 , 39 , 47 , old age 9 , 20 , 22 , 48 , 55 , co-morbidities 48 , worker compensation claim 2 , 22 , 23 . Potentially modifiable variable include : tobacco use 11 , 38 , limit preoperative range motion 45 , surgeon volume 48 . Two modifiable variable surgical technique postoperative management . As advance arthroscopic technique evolve , variety study evaluate different surgical technique clinical series trial 3 , 4 , 20 , 12 , 18 , 31 , 36 . In 2006 , Park et al describe `` transosseous equivalent '' repair technique characterize suture secure medially , pass top rotator cuff , secure laterally 44 . This method repair show well biomechanical property produce superior heal rate compare technique randomize clinical trial 5 , 12 . These data suggest technique currently best available method repair rotator cuff tear . Postoperative management patient rotator cuff repair receive little attention literature , yet likely one important modifiable variable influence rotator cuff repair integrity . It argue early physical therapy may increase failure rate rotator cuff repair 1 , 14 . This lead recommend delay therapy 6 week surgery . Three group study delay onset physiotherapy patient full thickness rotator cuff tear . Klintberg et al 29 perform randomize trial patient underwent open rotator cuff repair compare two postoperative physical therapy protocol : `` Progressive Therapy Group '' Â¬ ( start day surgery passive range motion dynamic muscle activation rotator cuff , sling remove 4 week rotator cuff load progressive rehabilitation ) , `` Traditional Group '' ( passive range motion day surgery immobilization sling 6 week time rotator cuff load apply ) . In trial significant difference outcome detect . In contrast , Deutsch et al 7 report 70 patient single row arthroscopic rotator cuff repair simple suture configuration randomize one two physical therapy protocols different `` Standard '' protocol begin passive forward elevation postoperative day 7 ( N=37 ) , whereas `` Delayed '' protocol begin passive forward elevation 4 week ( N=33 ) . At 6 month range motion different , however ultrasound examination demonstrate 19 % repair fail `` Standard '' group , whereas 9 % fail `` Delayed '' group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . In prospective cohort study present Accousti et al 1 , 56 patient manage 6 week immobilization follow rotator cuff repair . When immobilization remove , 13 patient consider `` stiff '' limited motion , 43 `` good '' passive motion . By one year none patient consider stiff . In `` stiff '' group rotator cuff repair fail 30 % , whereas group `` good '' motion six week 62 % repair fail . These data , limited , suggest period immobilization may improve heal rotator cuff repair . The effect immobilization measure outcome unclear . Unfortunately none study use transosseous equivalent repair technique . The purpose study compare two different strategy postoperative management patient isolate supraspinatus rotator cuff tear repair standardized `` SpeedBridge '' arthroscopic transosseous equivalent technique , use disease specific validated measure outcome ( WORC index ) primary outcome variable . The design multicenter randomize trial compare immediate delayed physical therapy . As patient orient outcomes frequently correlate rotator cuff repair heal 50 , second aim study effect rehabilitation paradigm rotator cuff heal MRI .</detailed_description>
