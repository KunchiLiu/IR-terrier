	<brief_summary>Cervical collar commonly use provide external immobilization elective Posterior Cervical Laminectomy Interbody Fusion ( PCLIF ) . The rationale collar use perception assumption prevent early instrumentation failure promote successful spinal fusion . However , number potential complication associate cervical collar skin breakdown , ulceration , neck pain , impedance upon activity daily live , impaired swallowing . Considering conflict factor , wide disagreement among spinal surgeon utility , benefit , necessity collar use follow elective PCLIF . Hypothesis : Wearing cervical collar 12 week posterior cervical laminectomy instrumented fusion demonstrate substantial benefit measure incidence instrumentation failure , rate nonunion , clinical outcome measure . Specific Aim I : To compare outcome surgery patient wear cervical collar 12 week follow surgery versus collar remove prior discharge surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collar Immobilization Following Posterior Cervical Laminectomy Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following informed consent process , subject fill baseline questionnaire consist demographic information , visual analog scale ( VAS ) pain score neck arm pain , Neck Disability Index Questionnaire ( NDI ) . Following surgery , surgeon fill operative data collection sheet record information : level fuse , type instrumentation , pre- post-operative sagittal alignment , intra-operative complication ( applicable ) . Subjects randomize `` collar '' `` collar '' group immediately follow surgery , use computer generate randomization scheme , influence surgeon 's operative technique . If patient randomize `` collar '' group , actually hard cervical collar place operating room surgery . This remain place 1 2 day discontinue prior discharge . If patient randomize `` collar '' group , hard cervical collar place surgery . The collar removed/exchanged bathing , grooming , dress change . It remain place 12 week . The patient undergo usual customary clinical radiographic follow-up . This include physical examination cervical radiograph take 2 week , 12 week , 6 month , 1 year . VAS Neck Disability Index score obtain 2 week , 12 week , 6 month , 1 year follow-up visit . Radiographs assess two independent radiologist instrumentation failure ( define following : screw loosening , screw breakage , rod breakage , screw dislodgement ) fusion status . Solid fusion define bridge trabecular bone along lateral masses/facet joint operate segment assessed lateral cervical radiograph . In addition , overall sagittal alignment spine measure . For primary outcome study , final follow-up 1 year would consider satisfactory determine difference pseudarthrosis instrumentation failure .</detailed_description>
