	<brief_summary>The goal clinical trial determine toxicity also efficacy treatment include follow treatment : Two medication , bortezomib dexamethasone ( BD ) , follow autologous stem cell transplantation , prolonged course treatment bortezomib dexamethasone transplantation . This type treatment effective multiple myeloma . However , little experience treatment patient Monoclonal Immunoglobulin Deposition Disease ( MIDD ) amyloidosis . The investigator others treat patient MIDD amyloidosis bortezomib autologous stem cell transplantation success treatment . But combination autologous transplant BD give transplant new way treating disease , investigator believe effective .</brief_summary>
