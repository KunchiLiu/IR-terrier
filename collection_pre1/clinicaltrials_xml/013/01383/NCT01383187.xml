	<detailed_description>Deep skin burn injury ( i.e . third-degree deep second-degree burn ) , especially extensive deep burn /and deep burn extend face , hand , foot , genitalia perineum remain one challenging problem modern medicine difficult , complicate long clinical course recovery . Extensive deep burn injury , despite progress treatment , ordinarily associate shock , infection , MODS , electrolyte imbalance , respiratory distress , … high morbidity mortality rate . Regardless extent , burn likewise painful necessity treat pain majority patient , comprehensive treatment wound management deep burn often demand confinement bed , splinting , special position - patient point time unable care restrict habitual life pattern . Despite progress achieve treatment process , therapeutic result sometimes unacceptable due functional cosmetic deficit cause severe psychological emotional distress , particularly due scar physical deformity - i.e . hypertrophic scar , joint contracture , peripheral neuropathy , psychiatric psychological disease , well thermoregulation disorder . Consequently quality life may markedly decrease . That new method burn wound cover intensively search . Based upon result available pre-clinical study , local use autologous platelet concentrate active growth factor appear good possibility improve faster high quality heal deep skin burn wound . To achieve best possible therapeutic result accurate diagnosis depth skin destruction depend accurate choice treatment strategy fundamental . The standard method determination burn depth clinical examination . Presence eschar , i.e . evidently devitalised tissue , mean necessity surgical treatment clinical diagnosis obvious . The accurate clinical assessment deep dermal burn , may sometimes heal spontaneously 21 day without surgical treatment , case complicate controversial . If heal 21 day complete possibility spontaneous heal improbable , surgical treatment indicate . In controversial case dominant role play clinical experience diagnostic capability examine burn´s surgeon . Indication surgical treatment directly depend human factor relate risk incorrect decision . Despite fact generally accept physical diagnostic method detect depth burn , objective method improve accuracy diagnosis use parallel clinical observation desirable . In Burn centre investigator use laser Doppler method determine depth burn mean apparatus LDPI PIM III ( Perimed Co , Jarfalla , Sweden ) . This device detect skin perfusion change course time . Third degree burn low level skin perfusion course time increase perfusion unit measure area . Deep second degree burn presumption spontaneous heal within 14 - 21 day show continued increase perfusion unit second ninth day post-injury . Deep second degree burn heal time longer 21 day show minimal increase perfusion unit second eleventh post-injury day . Current treatment deep burn consist surgical excision necrotic tissue follow dermoepidermal skin autografting . Central role platelet haemostatic thrombotic process well know . This due many clot growth factor store platelet granule . The successful use autologous platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) , i.e . Autologous Platelet Concentrate ( APC ) improve heal recently test limited vivo lately clinical trial well , however publish study knowledge test APC treatment deep skin burn human . Based data publish literature limited clinical experience use APC treat severe skin ulceration , investigator would like use knew experimental treatment patient population suffer deep skin burn . 1. third-degree burn , i.e . full thickness burn involve layer skin . 2. fourth-degree burn - muscle , bone blood vessel also injure . 2/ deep second-degree burn , i.e . burn involve damage epidermis deep part dermis layer skin . Deep second-degree burn sometimes heal spontaneously , however case investigator suppose heal take long three week , investigator indicate surgical treatment optimal functional cosmetic result . Surgical excision devitalise burn tissue subsequent skin graft basis longtime clinical experience become gold standard treatment deep partial thickness full thickness skin burn generally represent treatment choice Burn center.In order achieve best therapeutic result , i.e . un-complicated , quick high quality healing , new method burn wound cover intensively search . One many possibility topical transplantation APC , successfully use many surgical field twenty year , still widely uncertified clinical practice burn´s medicine . A concentrate autologous thrombocyte - Autologous Platelet Concentrate ( APC ) apply locally area autotransplanted surface . The applied growth factor initiate chemotaxis , proliferation , angiogenesis , proteosynthesis , reparation remodel impaired tissue ( najít citaci ) . The elevated concentration growth factor area lesion significantly speed process reparation regeneration - inflammatory phase reduce , leukocytes cytokine , well interleukins present normal , non-elevated concentration ( uvést odkaz ) . The damage tissue heals markedly reduce swell pain also unambiguously ( jednoznačně ) reduce virtue less nociceptive afferentation . The antioedematous effect seem result earlier angiogenesis , weak antiendothelial bound elevate permeability proteins erythrocytes extracellular space quickly replace adequate endothelial layer , due proliferation endothelium . The healing process complete remodel scar , together anticipate reduction hypertrophic scarring .</detailed_description>
