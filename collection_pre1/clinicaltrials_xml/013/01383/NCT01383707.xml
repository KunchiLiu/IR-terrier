	<brief_summary>The multicenter , open-label , single-arm , non-randomized , two-stage Simon 's design , phase II study ( The CLMO-001 Trial ) evaluate efficacy safety bevacizumab combination mFOLFOX-6 ( Levofolinic acid , 5-Fluorouracil [ 5-FU ] oxaliplatin ) participant colorectal cancer liver metastasis . Participants receive combination therapy bevacizumab 5 milligram per kilogram ( mg/kg ) intravenous ( IV ) dose mFOLFOX-6 every 2 week Cycles 1-5 Cycles 7-12 . Participants receive mFOLFOX-6 alone ( without bevacizumab ) Cycle 6 . In Cycle 6 7 , participant undergo liver surgery operable . Thereafter participant receive bevacizumab ( 5 mg/kg IV every 2 week ) alone 52 week ( 26 cycle ) end post-operative phase ( maintenance therapy ) . At end preoperative treatment phase ( Cycles 1-6 ) , participant show different alternative condition admit protocol undergo different management ( alternative study design 1 3 ) .</brief_summary>
