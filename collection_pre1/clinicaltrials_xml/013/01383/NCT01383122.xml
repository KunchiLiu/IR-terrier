	<brief_summary>Pain follow Cesarean delivery remain common post-operative complaint , provision effective safe analgesia important . Pain impede mother 's ability mobilise , care breastfeed newborn baby . Pulsed electromagnetic field ( PEMF ) device use various clinical setting , especially plastic surgery , reduce postoperative swell pain , well accelerate wound repair . PEMF therapy simple use , cost-effective know side effect . Despite advance post-operative analgesia , pain relief maternal satisfaction remain inadequate patient . Improving quality post-Cesarean analgesia limit undesirable side effect enhance maternal satisfaction reduce risk post-operative complication . The investigator hypothesize continuous use PEMF device 48 hour Cesarean delivery result decrease post-operative pain score movement 48 hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Pulsed Electromagnetic Field Therapy Management Post-operative Pain Following Cesarean Delivery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , institution , analgesic regimen multimodal , combine analgesic drug differ mechanisms action , aim produce effective analgesia minimise adverse effect . They include opioid drug , administer neuro-axially systemically , well paracetamol non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . Opioids , effective , significant adverse effect , include sedation , nausea , vomit constipation . Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) reduce opioid consumption , also side effect , contra-indicated significant number patient . Therefore remain considerable scope improve post-Cesarean analgesia . Pulsed electromagnetic field ( PEMF ) technology relieve edema , inflammation pain stabilize leak cell membrane . The short burst electrical current produce heat interfere nerve muscle function . The pulsed energy drive edematous fluid along by-product damage tissue , reduces swell helps re-establish cell-cell communication . The device easily apply wound dressing , know side effect either mother infant . As rate Cesarean delivery continue increase , remain significant problem current analgesic regimen , use pulse electromagnetic field therapy potential considerably improve acute chronic post-Cesarean pain management , lead widespread change clinical practice .</detailed_description>
