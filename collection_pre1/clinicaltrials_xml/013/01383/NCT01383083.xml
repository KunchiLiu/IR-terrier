	<brief_summary>The prevalence PAH associate congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt Western country estimate range 1.6 12.5 case per million adult , 25-50 % population affect Eisenmenger 's syndrome . The rarity syndrome , combine complex pathophysiology , account insufficient understanding principle underlie proper treatment.Recent decade see development pulmonary hypertension pathophysiology lead introduction new group drug : prostacycline analog ( Epoprostenol , Treprostinil , Beraprost , Illoprost ) , phosphodiesterase inhibitor ( Sildenafil , Tadalafil ) , endothelin receptor antagonist ( Bosentan , Sitaxantan , Ambrisentan ) nitric oxide . These drug administer patient III-IV NYHA class . Despite successful early result , therapeutic effect patient Eisenmenger syndrome conclusively establish The treatment strategy patient PAH associate congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt , particular , Eisenmenger 's syndrome base mainly clinical experience rather evidence base . Although Eisenmenger 's syndrome uncurable disease , survival rate relatively high primary PAH , patient Eisenmenger 's syndrome relatively young group . So improvement exercise tolerance quality life important . Several randomize control trial report favourable short- long-term outcome treatment orally active dual endothelin receptor antagonist bosentan patient Eisenmenger 's syndrome . However , scare data outcome treatment inhale iloprost patient Eisenmenger 's syndrome . In Korea , patient Eisenmenger 's syndrome treat conservative therapy instead administration PAH-specific drug , lack clinical experience . Moreover , oral agent bosentan , sidenafil prefer iloprost becase evidence convenience . Our therapeutic effort direct mainly towards prevent complication . As rule , avoid agent establish therapeutic efficacy try alleviate symptom without additional risk , disrupt exist clinical balance . In study , investigate know clinical benefit iloprost patient Eisenmenger 's syndrome use functional hemodynamic parameter , would add evidence PAH-specific agent Eisenmenger 's syndrome</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A large proportion patient congenital heart disease ( CHD ) , particular relevant systemic-to-pulmonary shunt , develop pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) leave untreated . Persistent exposure pulmonary vasculature increase blood flow , well increased pressure , may result pulmonary obstructive arteriopathy , lead increase pulmonary vascular resistance , approach exceeds systemic resistance , result shunt reversal . Eisenmenger 's syndrome , advanced form PAH associate CHD , define CHD initial large systemic-to-pulmonary shunt induces severe pulmonary vascular disease PAH , resultant reversal shunt central cyanosis . The histopathological pathobiological change see patient PAH associate congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt , endothelial dysfunction pulmonary vasculature , consider similar observed idiopathic associate form PAH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients Eisenmenger syndrome clinically stable World Health Organization functional class ( WHO class ) III bad select treatment . 2 . Eisenmenger syndrome diagnose echocardiographically righttoleft shunt shunt defect . 3 . To exclude cause PAH , lung function test ( spirometry , force expiratory volume 1 second , force vital capacity ) obtain . 1 . Patients severe leave ventricular dysfunction and/or pulmonary venous congestion ( measure invasively assess echocardiographically ) exclude . 2 . Patients obstruction right ventricular outflow tract , pulmonary valve , pulmonary artery patient prostacyclin , glibenclamide , cyclosporine treatment exclude . 3 . Patients contraindication Ventavis ; Hypersensitive Ventavis High risk bleeding , increase use Ventavis ( e.g . active peptic ulcer , trauma , intracranial hemorrhage ) Severe coronary disease , unstable angina , history Acute myocardial infarction within 6 month , uncompensated heart failure close medical monitoring , severe arrhythmia , suspect pulmonary congestion , cerebrovascular disease within 3 month ( e.g . transient ischemic attack , stoke ) pulmonary hypertension due venous occlusive disease valvular defect dysfunction cardiac muscle , independent pulmonary hypertension pregnancy , woman high probability pregnancy , breast feed renal failure ( creatinine clearance &lt; 30mL/min )</criteria>
