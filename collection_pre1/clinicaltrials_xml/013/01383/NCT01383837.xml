The pilot test evaluate feasibility acceptability conduct intervention outpatient clinic treat adolescent SUD , examine optimal factor influence research method , estimate intervention parameter RCT . Acceptability feasibility assess use process measure follow session well intervention complete . The investigator assess change sexual risk behavior outcome baseline 3 month post-intervention . This study lay groundwork refining design RCT new intervention . Implementing HIV/STI sexual risk reduction intervention clinic provide SUD treatment represent innovative potentially cost-effective approach enable typically overburdened SUD treatment provider address heighten HIV/STI risk SUD youth .
