	<brief_title>Retinal Laser Multi-spot Photocoagulator Driving Eligibility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite improvement management diabetes , incidence severe diabetes -related eye disease remain high . Laser treatment ( panretinal photocoagulation ( PRP ) ) gold standard treatment reduce risk visual loss . However , evidence suggest PRP damage visual field function thus jeopardize patient ' eligibility drive . In UK , patient 's responsibility inform DVLA receive retinal laser . With use multi-spot Photocoagulator application PRP Moorfields investigator unique position ass effect laser apply new delivery system visual field detailed fashion . Thus provide accurate advice visual prognosis visual field function address risk lose ability drive . All treatment-naive patient severe diabetic retinopathy require bilateral retinal laser treatment identify . Following informed consent patient undergo baseline visual field test duration approximately 30 minute complete quality life questionnaire . All patient receive laser treatment part standard clinical care via multi-spot Photocoagulator require approximately four 20 minute session . At 6 month follow completion treatment patient undergo repeat visual field test conducted baseline complete quality life questionnaire . The investigator hope recruit 100 patient . Analysis visual field principally involve assessment whether patient meet UK drive standard Estermann VF test . A quantitative assessment change retinal sensitivity undertaken compare retinal sensitivity pre post-PRP .</detailed_description>
