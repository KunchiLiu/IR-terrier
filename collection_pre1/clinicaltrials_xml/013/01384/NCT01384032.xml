	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) recognise one main cause death western world . LDL- cholesterol ( 'bad ' cholesterol ) lipid ( fat ) important CVD risk factor . Apolipoprotein E ( apoE ) important transporter fat blood . ApoE come E2 , E3 E4 form , depend genetic make . Approximately 60 % UK population E3/E3 , 25 % E4 carriers 15 % E2 carrier . There evidence suggest E4 genotype may put modestly high risk CVD . Furthermore although inconclusive previous study suggest E4 individual slightly sensitive LDL-cholesterol modifying effect dietary fat ( saturate fat , total fat , fish oil ) showing slightly , great reduction low level fat consume , great increase high level fat consume . Therefore , aim Satgene study examine impact modification dietary total fat saturate fat intake , alone combination fish oil supplement LDL-cholesterol blood lipid , individual E3 E4 genotype . The level total fat saturate fat use current study within range observe typical UK population .</brief_summary>
