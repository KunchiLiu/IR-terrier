	<detailed_description>Introduction Air medical service routinely transport patient intubate mechanically ventilate . Transporting patient population safe patient subject change barometric pressure flight . Aircraft use typically maintain cabin pressure 3000 7000 foot sea level . This compare commercial aircraft maintain cabin pressure 5000 8000 foot . A known volume gas expand ambient pressure decrease . If gas expand , pressure exert gas enclose space increase . An aircraft cabin ambient pressure 3000 7000 foot altitude result 9 23 % decrease ambient pressure compare sea level . Tracheal tube cuff subject change ambient pressure occur transport . Tracheal tube cuff minimize risk tracheal mucosal injury , high pressure occur . A recent series intubate adult patient undergo transfer helicopter show 58 % initial pressure great 40 cm H2O . A subsequent study reveal pressure exceed 40 cm H2O two third patient 30 cm H2O nearly three quarter . There risk tracheal mucosa blood flow compromise 30 cm H2O , cease lateral wall pressure 50 cm H2O . These high pressure result complication range sore throat major complication tracheal ischemia fistula formation . To avoid tracheal injury related complication , tracheal tube cuff pressure maintain less 30 cm H2O . Sterile saline inflate cuff decrease risk compressible subject atmospheric pressure change much gas . Saline cause less cuff pressure increase tracheal morbidity operating room , avoids excessive pressure due change altitude , safe transport . However , ability saline prevent increase cuff pressure air medical transport safety profile use study . Objectives Compare tracheal tube cuff pressure , fill either air sterile saline , altitudes routinely encounter intubate mechanically ventilated adult patient undergo air medical transport . Methods Study design Conduct prospective , randomize , blind study tracheal tube cuff pressure , fill either air sterile saline , pressurize fix wing unpressurized rotor wing aircraft determine impact cuff content ( air versus saline ) altitude cuff pressure flight . Study set population Ontario large Canadian province mix urban , suburban , rural , remote area . Ornge Transport Medicine publicly fund air medical transport system provide air medical patient transfer Ontario . Ornge carry approximately 19,000 patient transport annually , approximately 1,000 intubated . This study screen consecutive intubate patient transport pressurized fix wing aircraft unpressurized rotor wing aircraft . Patients screen begin July 1 , 2011 end requisite number patient receuited aircraft type . Patients eligible adult ( actual estimate age &gt; 18 year ) , undergo interfacility patient transfer , intubate cuffed tracheal tube mechanically ventilate prior transport , transport Ornge 's dedicate aircraft flight paramedic crew , plan flight &gt; 20 minute ( rotor wing ) &gt; 30 minute ( fix wing ) . Patients exclude meet inclusion criterion condition require cabin altitude &lt; 1000 foot prevent barotrauma . For ineligible patient , paramedic submit complete screen tool copy patient care report research coordinator . Investigators retrospectively review dispatch record identify intubated patient transport determine total patient population eligible study . Planned flight time &gt; 20 minute ( rotor wing ) &gt; 30 minute ( fix wing ) select review record flight less duration would typically enough time cruise altitude stabilize cabin pressure , equilibrate tracheal tube cuff pressure , complete in-flight portion protocol . Study protocol This study conduct two patient cohort : 1 ) fix wing patient cohort pressurize cabin , 2 ) rotor wing patient cohort unpressurized cabin . Each cohort randomize 'sterile saline ' ( 'experimental ' ) 'air ' ( 'control ' ) arm . The paramedic use study-specific medical directive approve Ornge Medical Advisory Committee . Prior commence study , paramedic review self-directed learning module . One investigator contact paramedic confirm completion module answer question . Paramedics able enroll patient investigator confirm completion material . Paramedics screen potentially eligible patient prior depart send facility , randomize eligible patient . Patients withdraw due consideration patient safety complete set outcome data , report analyzed separately . Flight crew routinely determine cabin altitude unless medical need cabin pressure equial 1000 foot less . Randomization Randomization occur dedicate aircraft , block ten , 1:1 ratio . Study package prepare , number sequentially , track single Research Coordinator . The coordinator maintain confidential log package 's randomization allocation , aircraft assignment , current location , use . The coordinator also receive complete study material study data receive flight paramedic crew , dispatch record ensure eligible patient identify screened paramedic crew . Fixed wing Patients transport pressurized fix wing aircraft randomize tracheal tube cuff fill air sterile saline . The cabin pressurize set maintain fixed cabin pressure determine flight crew . All dedicate fix wing aircraft make model capable maintain fix cabin pressure set . Rotor wing Patients transport unpressurized rotor wing aircraft randomize tracheal tube cuff fill either air sterile saline . The cabin pressure rotor wing aircraft equivalent ambient air pressure cabin pressurize . If randomize patient experience unexpected situation require cabin pressurization 1000 foot sea level less point flight ( either prior measurement tracheal tube cuff pressure cruise altitude ) , paramedic may request pilot pressurize cabin accord patient requirement . If medical condition aviation situation require deviation study protocol , management medical condition aviation situation shall take precedence , patient may withdraw study . If patient randomize complete study , patient withdrawn study , reason report `` paramedic # 1 data collection sheet '' . The patient include analysis change tracheal tube cuff pressure pressure measurement complete , reason ( ) study termination report . Paramedics complete patient care report usual manner fax , along two paramedic data collection sheet , dedicate fax line use `` rapid fax transmission '' cover page . They return original documentation Ornge corporate headquarters usual manner . The pilot forward pilot data collection sheet Ornge Air corporate headquarters usual manner . All record ship store use policy procedure consistent exist privacy legislation regulation . The research coordinator enter study data element study-specific , password-protected database store secure computer server . Outcome measure The primary outcome measure incidence tracheal tube cuff pressure exceed 30 cm H2O cruise portion flight . This approximately 10 minute aircraft take . The secondary endpoint include incidence tracheal tube cuff pressure exceed 30 cm H2O initial inflation cuff prior departure send facility , change cuff pressure ground flight cruise altitude , incidence cuff leak tracheal tube malfunction , incidence adverse event related tracheal tube cuff , ( include relate use sterile saline cuff ) transport set . All outcome measure obtain assessed day 1 , namely time period flight paramedic provide care patient . No data available transfer care take place receive facility . Sample size power calculation Tracheal tube cuff pressure typically inflated pressure range 20 25 cm H2O , tracheal mucosal injury occur cuff pressure exceed 30 cm H2O .
