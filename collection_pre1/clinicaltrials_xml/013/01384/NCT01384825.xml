	<brief_title>Observational Study Prevalence CCSVI Multiple Sclerosis Other Neurodegenerative Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It recently report possible presence abnormality cerebral venous circulation people MS , healthy control people neurological disease . These report arouse much interest scientific world , , among community patient Associations aim aid people MS promote scientific research disease . In particular , study Zamboni colleague ( Ferrara University ) Zivadinov colleague ( University Buffalo ) suggest association CCSVI MS widely report mass medium world-wide . It note literature publish far lack verification large sample prevalence CCSVI MS compare observe healthy subject diseases nervous system . The recent authoritative contribution scientific community involve MS stress need closely control suitably design clinical study investigate hypothesis suggest regard CCSVI ( necessary thoroughness promptness demand public opinion ) therefore definitely justified . The possibility may new pathogenic mechanism underlie development MS , line majority experimental data concern aetiopathogenesis disease , produce strong echo throughout scientific community . Increasingly , recent month , work group mention new author develop research study order confirm extend result obtain lay scientifically sound foundation possible therapeutic application discovery . The Fondazione Italiana Sclerosi Multipla ( FISM ) Onlus , capacity Promoter study , wish , responsibly , produce best possible answer people MS world . It therefore feel necessary proceed utmost scientific thoroughness , initially mean large-scale sample study evaluate prevalence venous abnormality MS compare observe normal control control disease nervous system . In context , feature study distinguish previous study current state knowledge follow : 1 . Blind multi-Site observational study use Echo-Color-Doppler equipment assign study ; 2 . Size sample MS , least 1200 study subject ; 3 . Evaluation prevalence CCSVI malformation venous haemodynamics Clinically Isolated Syndrome ( CIS ) , Relapsing-Remitting ( RR ) , Primary Progressive ( PP ) Secondary Progressive ( SP ) form MS , use large sample involve present time . In observational study , prevalence CCSVI malformation venous haemodynamics evaluate different form MS diseases nervous system . This therefore observational study investigate prevalence CCSVI subject MS compare prevalence observe control population consist healthy subject population people neurological disease central peripheral nervous system degenerative , vascular , inflammatory autoimmune origin . The study multi-Site observational study . A total least 1,200 adult MS include study , well 400 healthy subject 400 subject neurodegenerative disease .</detailed_description>
