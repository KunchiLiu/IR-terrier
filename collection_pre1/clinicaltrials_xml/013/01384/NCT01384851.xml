	<brief_title>Efficacy Chronic Application Tear Formulations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Environmentally induce dry eye condition occur otherwise asymptomatic individual certain situation , example use computer , overheat air condition workplace condition low humidity . The common ocular complaint associate environment burn , dryness , sting , grittiness . Although exact cause symptom unknown , think increase tear evaporation rate due low humidity play vital role . The change tear film physiology , occur environment , traditionally dealt use eye drop ( particularly highly viscous variety ) , show effective therapeutic option treatment environmental dry eye disease . Previous study use eye-drops various formulation show improvement tear physiology mild moderate dry eye patient use acute chronic application protocol . In study , attempt make relate effect tear physiology induced variation environmental condition beneficial effect produce use eye-drop .</detailed_description>
