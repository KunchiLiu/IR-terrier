The investigator use technique extensively past study . Losartan Administration ( Night = 0 , = 5 ) Losartan novel orally available FDA-approved drug pharmacologically inhibit renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system . In particular , primary mechanism action inhibit production vasoconstrictor angiotensin II . It strong record safety efficacy benefit patient grade heart failure . losartan dose base individual body weight . The max dose regimen propose ( 25 mg losartan/day ) predict drop systolic blood pressure approximately 5-12 mmHg diastolic 4-8 mmHg . The response expect profound among individual high systolic blood pressure . For safety purpose investigator administer losartan 25 mg BID . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) Administration ( Night = 0 , = 5 ) NAC cysteine donor antioxidant approve use human , orally intravenously . When give treat acetaminophen overdose , NAC typically give large bolus ( ~120-150 mg/kg 15-60 minute ) , follow continued administration next 20-36 hour . NAC also use cysteine donor malnourish child , HIV infect individual , patient pulmonary disease . When administer orally , sulfur content NAC reduce palatability . As result , typically mixed soda , juice , flavor drink mix . A recent study find NAC , administer 75mg/kg oral bolus mixed flavor drink mix , well tolerate markedly influenced 3-methylhistidine level . The investigator follow strategy , administer 50 mg/kg dos mixed flavor drink . With oral intravenous administration , side effect associate initial bolus loading period . With intravenous infusion , `` anaphylactoid '' reaction common potentially serious oral administration . As result , intravenous load protocol develop McKenna 's research group specifically safely study acute effect NAC skeletal muscle . In protocol , subject receive initial bolus infusion 125 mg/kg/h NAC 15 minute , follow constant infusion 25 mg/kg/h thereafter ; protocol well-tolerated minimal side effect . As establish protocol exist chronic infusion NAC aim improve skeletal muscle redox homeostasis anabolic sensitivity hospitalization old adult , investigator propose administer NAC orally , reduce likelihood anaphylactoid reaction , 50 mg/kg bolus administer 3 time day . Our rationale follow : 1 ) As oppose set acute acetaminophen toxicity , oxidative stress expect develop suddenly hospitalization-induced inactivity ; thus , gradual approach plateau systemic NAC level satisfactory minimize likelihood NAC-induced side effect , 2 ) base recent study NAC effect exercise-induced oxidative stress , infusion affect redox status vivo , 3 ) total NAC dose per day 150 mg/kg , approximately half total amount administer first 24 hour follow acetaminophen overdose previous study NAC effect healthy young control ( ~320 mg/kg ) .

Statistical Considerations Analyses aim primarily statistical model assess effect two main treatment variable losartan ( Yes vs. No ) NAC ( Yes vs. No ) . These two factor along control ( placebo losartan plus placebo NAC ) condition form three group interest statistical model . Statistical Analysis . Data outcomes collect baseline performance metabolic study . Our general approach address specific secondary aim develop analysis variance ( ANOVA ) model outcome interest . Only losartan NAC effect test model , combine ( losartan + NAC ) treatment group propose . Each outcome different ANOVA model . The main outcome FSR 3 measure . The statistical model fit maximum likelihood base class model call mixed model , allow dropout occur without introduction bias . Common software available MIXED procedure SAS . Main effect assess . A covariance structure choose accord suggestion Grady Helms . Mean differences outcomes 95 % confidence interval report . Gender difference assess include gender covariate model . The investigator also examine ( gender - treatment ) interaction ass treatment equally effective gender . If term significant , investigator initially leave gender model potential adjustment . If gender term significant , imply gender add information model drop . Sample Size Power . A power analysis conduct assess ability study design detect statistical significance avoid type II error . Estimates variation data originate PI 's lab well publish study . Conservative assumption make overestimate power . Power base change across two time point end study . The strategy demonstrate power outcome use ANOVA model , address specific aim simultaneously . FSR Extensive preliminary data available research team regard change protein synthesis . The primary statistical approach ANOVA study design describe Aim 1 . Preliminary data PI 's lab available outcome FSR .

Based previous animal study find antioxidant administration restore amino acid stimulation muscle protein synthesis , along fact losartan NAC may exert non-perfusion related effect could augment anabolic response , investigator estimate change 0.07 treatment , SD change score 0.026 . Power calculation SAS procedure GLMPOWER indicate N=8 per group ( 24 total ) provide &gt; 99 % power detect treatment effect , use 2-sided alpha level significance 0.05 . Summary : Sample size calculation demonstrate N=8 subject per group ( N=24 total ) provide sufficient power ass specific aim , across two main outcome assess lean body mass functional assessment . The investigator also show study FSR design . As human intervention study , investigator expect attrition . To account expected attrition rate 20 % investigator randomize 1.2x8=10 subject per group ( N=30 total ) . The investigator screen 48 people achieve total 24 complete study . Future Studies Many potential avenue may explore follow experiment . If hypothesis correct , finding losartan capable significantly improve nutritive flow skeletal muscle capacity net muscle protein anabolism , investigator pursue longer-term outcome study novel vasodilator , perhaps simulated hospitalization period . Potential future study include look amino acid signal pathway determine suppression TGF-β block transcriptional upregulation ubiquitin E3 ligases . However , finding losartan promote nutritive flow skeletal muscle capacity net muscle protein anabolism , investigator examine mechanism behind apparent lack nutritive flow mediate stimulation muscle protein synthesis ( e.g. , study amino acid determine defect lie intracellular signal pathway ) . If losartan NAC successfully improve nutritive flow skeletal muscle capacity net muscle protein anabolism healthy old subject , investigator pursue additional outcome study follow inactivity , like common elective surgery hip knee replacement .</detailed_description>
