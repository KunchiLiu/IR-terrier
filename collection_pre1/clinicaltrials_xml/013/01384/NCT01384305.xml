	<brief_summary>Even though rare disorder usually limit case number , induce huge impact patient family , heavily burden society healthcare system well . Therefore , essential detect occurrence disorder thus take appropriate measure early possible . The preventive goal base comprehensive understanding rare disorder , available diagnostic therapeutic approach . However , study relate rare disorder often impede limited sample size infrequent exchange research material among institute . After refer foreign experience , investigator notice non-profit tissue bank reposit biological sample thus provide researcher access sample , may solution . Through share public asset , investigator believe quantity quality rare disorder study improve , collaboration various research institute also strengthen afterwards . Most important , achievement ultimately benefit patient , family whole society .</brief_summary>
