	<brief_title>Do Weight Status Level Dietary Restraint Moderate Relationship Between Package Unit Size Food Intake ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The estimate prevalence obesity among adult 2007-2008 33.8 % combine estimate prevalence overweight obesity 68.0 % [ 1 ] . Although clear reason current obesity epidemic , general consensus environmental dietary factor , package unit size , encourage excessive food intake positive energy balance [ 2 , 3 ] . It believe package unit size food indirectly influence food intake impact accuracy consumption monitor [ 2 , 4 ] . Large package decrease accuracy consumption monitor make difficult assess many serving consume one sitting , small single-serving package increase accuracy consumption monitor provide clear definition standard serve much one consume [ 2 , 4 , 5 ] . Therefore , propose small , single-serving package snack food may help reduce energy intake [ 4 , 5 ] . To date , limited study conduct area result inconsistent [ 4-9 ] . Mixed result could relate difference participant variable , specifically weight status level dietary restraint ( term refers amount control exert food intake ) [ 4 , 9 ] . These individual characteristic may interact food package unit size influence one 's food intake [ 2 , 4 ] . Overweight individual restrain eater may closely monitor volume food consume compare normal weight unrestrained eater [ 4 , 9 ] . The [ small ] size food packaging may aid monitoring food consumption thus , influence much food consume overweight and/or restrain eater [ 2 , 4 ] . Therefore , objective study determine weight status level dietary restraint moderate relationship package unit size food intake . Specific Aims : 1 . Determine effect dietary restraint relationship package unit size food intake . 2 . Determine effect weight status relationship package unit size food intake . 3 . Determine combined effect weight status dietary restraint relationship package unit size food intake .</detailed_description>
