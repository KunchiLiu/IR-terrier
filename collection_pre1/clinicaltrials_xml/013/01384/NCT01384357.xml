	<detailed_description>Introduction In absence infection sign , lateral neck lymphadenopathy suspect metastatic carcinoma lymphoma prove otherwise . Previously , commonly use sample technique head neck open excisional biopsy fine-needle aspiration ( FNA ) cytology . Open biopsy lymph node excision provide material suitable histological analysis invasive may entail general anesthesia hospital admission . Besides , excisional incisional biopsy cervical metastasis result 2-3 time increase incidence local treatment failure compare FNA cytology . High-resolution ultrasound widely use image modality evaluate morphology , internal architecture , size shape cervical lymph node . In head neck , image guidance technique commonly use ultrasound . The real-time capability ease use make ultrasound procedure choice . The evidence improve efficacy ultrasound-guided FNA palpation-guided FNA head neck also well document , lead acceptance standard procedure . Disadvantages FNA include high rate nondiagnostic sample incomplete classification lymphoma delay diagnosis . The core-needle biopsy ( CNB ) alternative establish way tissue sample use successfully many year . As histologic architecture lesion preserve , provide sample adequate histopathologic immunohistochemical examination . To knowledge , one prospective investigation compare ultrasound guide CNB FNA head neck region . However , studied population heterogeneous case number limit . The result reveal significant difference method . The objective present study compare ultrasound-guided CNB FNA assessment different malignant cervical lymphadenopathy . Patients methods A retrospective study perform include consecutive patient 3-year period 2007 July 2010 Dec. All patient see institution malignant cervical lymphadenopathy . The biopsy perform outpatient basis , unless patient hospitalize alternative reason . Equipment sonographic study consist color Doppler US unit ( Philips HDI 5000 , Bothell , WA , US ) 5-12 MHz broadband linear array transducer . Morphologic US parameter vascular feature thoroughly evaluate record PACS system ( Marotech Inc , Seoul , South Korea ) large nodal lesion patient . Every lymph node assess first gray-scale sonography morphologic parameter horizontal longitudinal section . The short-axis diameter , long-axis diameter diameter ratio short long axis ( S/L ratio ) measure . Echogenicity respect surround soft tissue assess classified hypoechoic , isoechoic , hyperechoic . Lymph node margin define regular irregular . Echogenic hilus distinguish presence absence . Internal echo pattern divide heterogeneity homogeneity . Vascular pattern survey power Doppler sonography categorize group avascular hilar type versus mixed , spot , peripheral type . With data history , physical examination , ultrasound result , decide ultrasound guide needle biopsy would first line investigation lesion . Informed consent procedure obtain patient biopsy . In general , FNA carry array probe guide placement 22-gauge fine needle within large node sterilization without anesthesia . For CNB , skin sterilize locally anaesthetize 2 % lidocaine . A modified non-advancing , disposable , spring-loaded cut biopsy needle ( Temno biopsy system , Allegiance Healthcare Corporation , McGaw Park , IL , USA ) 15-mm side-notch 9 cm length 18-gauge use . All biopsy do experienced otolaryngologist ( Li-Jen Liao ) real-time ultrasound guidance freehand technique . Three time tissue core biopsy do patient . After biopsy , patient ask compress puncture site evaluate possible complication bleed bruise half hour leave examination room . The specimen put 10 % formalin solution pathologic study . In Department Pathology , formalin-fixed , paraffin-embeddedm section biopsy stain hematoxylin eosin morphologic examination . Further immunohistochemical study perform necessary . There two major study group accord treatment status patient 's population . The first group include patient pathology proof previous cancer clinically cervical lymphadenopathy treatment . The second group include patient cervical lymphaenopathies without previous diagnosis malignancy treatment . The disease group classify metastatic node nonthyroid primary ( META ) , lymphoma ( LYM ) metastatic node papillary carcinoma thyroid ( PAP ) . The result cytology pathology grade false negative , suspicious positive malignancy . The final diagnosis patient establish histopathology . The time needle biopsy final diagnosis trace record . Statistically , continuous variable compare perform Kruskal-Wallis test . Category data compare use Chi-square test Fisher 's exact test . The time procedure final diagnosis express K-M plot test Log-rank test . All statistical analysis accomplish use SAS software , version 9.1 ( SAS Institute , Inc , Cary , North Carolina ) . Expected Results : We know differential US characteristic different malignant cervical lymphadenopathy . Besides , know US-FNA US-CNB preferred situation .</detailed_description>
