	<brief_summary>The overall goal project identify intermediate phenotype psychosis across schizophrenia bipolar disorder boundary implication future genetic study . Recent study provide considerable evidence schizophrenia psychotic bipolar disorder may share overlap etiologic determinant . Identifying disease-related genetic effect major focus schizophrenia bipolar research , enormous implication diagnosis treatment two disorder . Efforts multifaceted , ultimate goal describe causal path specific genetic variant , change neuronal functioning , alter brain anatomy , behavioral functional impairment . Parallel effort identify refined several alternative endophenotypes stable , heritable , ( partly ) know biological substrate , associate psychosis liability . Although many endophenotypes individually study schizophrenia , less extent bipolar disorder , study comprehensively assess broad panel marker two disorder parallel recruitment , extent mark independent aspect psychosis risk , overlap two disorder . In research project , examine broad panel putative endophenotypes affect individual first degree , biological relative order : 1 ) characterize degree familial phenotypic overlap schizophrenia psychotic bipolar disorder ; 2 ) identify pattern endophenotypes unique two disorder ; , 3 ) contrast heritability endophenotypes across disorder . We obtain measure neurophysiology ( e.g. , eye tracking , P50 gating , PPI , P300 ) , neurocognition ( e.g. , attention/vigilance , episodic work memory ) , brain structure ( e.g. , volume gray white matter specify brain region ) . Blood sample also collect store formal DNA linkage analysis use independent phenotype identify . All volunteer also give option donate dermal biopsy future research study . Establishing similarity difference endophenotypic signature within schizophrenia bipolar family provide important insight future genetic study , clarify concept common distinct aspect pathophysiology , potentially meaningful heterogeneity disorder , clinical boundary two common psychotic disorder adult psychiatry . This line investigation potentially impact conceptualization psychotic disorder , help u make critical stride identify pathophysiology psychosis , guide development new specific treatment target particular deficit .</brief_summary>
