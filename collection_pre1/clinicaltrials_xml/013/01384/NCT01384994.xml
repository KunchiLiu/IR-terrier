	<brief_summary>Up 50 % patient colorectal cancer ( CRC ) develop liver metastasis course disease . In 30-40 % patient metastasis confine liver . In patient R0-resection metastasis may contribute marked improvement overall survival . Primary resection liver metastasis possible 15-20 % patient ( Scheele 2005 , Petrelli 2005 ) . Recent study indicate perioperative chemotherapy may improve survival resection liver metastasis ( Portier 2007 , Nordlinger 2007 ) . Nevertheless , evidence 70-80 % patient recurrent disease resection liver metastasis . Stratification risk recurrence may perform use FONG-score ( Fong 1999 ) . This study design investigate efficacy postoperative chemotherapy combine anti-EGFR treatment use panitumumab . The majority patient present surgeon chemotherapeutic pretreatment various necessarily standardize regimen . Also postoperative therapy resection liver metastasis clearly define standard care Germany . Based study Nordlinger et al . oxaliplatin-based regimen choose postoperative therapy ( Nordlinger 2008 ) . For reason practicability mFOLFOX6 select chemotherapy backbone additive treatment ( Allegra 2010 ) . Also , evidence combination FOLFOX panitumumab associate enhanced antitumor activity ( Douillard et al . ESMO 2009 ) . The experimental treatment arm therefore evaluate combination FOLFOX plus panitumumab . Since colorectal cancer monoclonal antibody direct EGFR active KRAS mutant patient , experimental arm include panitumumab perform KRAS wild-type patient ( Amado 2008 ) . The plan study aim assess efficacy postoperative therapy FOLFOX plus panitumumab follow maintenance panitumumab 3 month KRAS wild-type patient , compare historical data standard FOLFOX chemotherapy alone , verify randomise control group without antibody . ( Figure 1 : Study Design ) . The study allow preoperative treatment regimen FOLFIRI , XELIRI , FOLFOX XELOX +/-bevacizumab +/- cetuximab . However , patient consider eligible progress preoperative therapy . After surgery , treatment-free interval least 4 week , longer 8 week grant . KRAS-wild-type patient ( 60 % pt ) randomize 2:1 ratio experimental arm FOLFOX + panitumumab reference arm FOLFOX alone . Combination treatment perform duration 3 month , patient experimental arm receive maintenance therapy panitumumab 3 month . In reference arm , treatment , however , end 3 month .</brief_summary>
