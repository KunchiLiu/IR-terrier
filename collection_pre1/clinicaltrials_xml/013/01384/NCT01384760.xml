	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) common form sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) characterize repetitive episode cessation breathe sleep due upper airway collapse . It cause sleep fragmentation , disable daytime sleepiness , impaired cognitive function poor quality life . In addition , OSAS associate non-fatal fatal cardiovascular consequence include sudden death , addition increase risk road traffic accident . OSAS equally common among middle-aged male Caucasian Hong Kong ( HK ) Chinese population prevalence rate least 4 % . The prevalence severity OSAS tend increase adult life , peak late fifty mid sixty , fail increase decrease . Another group investigator report high prevalence rate SDB group age 65-95 year 70 % men 56 % woman , least double report middle-aged cohort . Risk factor OSA include obesity , increase age , male , abnormal craniofacial morphology , nasal obstruction , genetic factor . OSA associate several cardiovascular consequence social consequence e.g . motor vehicle accident , impaired cognitive performance , depression . Various epidemiologic study show association OSA hypertension . In cross-sectional study , OSA associate increased prevalence self-reported heart failure stroke . OSA show independently associate coronary artery disease adjustment traditionally consider risk factor . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) consider first-line treatment OSA . Oral appliance show reduce severity sleep disorder breathe lead symptomatic improvement especially mild moderate OSA . The compliance CPAP low particularly mild moderate OSA patient curative treatment OSA . It use every night regular basis . Weight reduction always advocate patient OSA overweight may lead improvement severity OSA . A population-based longitudinal study show 10 % weight loss predict 26 % decrease apnoea-hypopnoea index ( AHI ) , count number upper airway obstruction per hour sleep . The exist study weight loss limit small sample size , short duration ( &lt; 6 month ) , focus low calorie diet program surgically induced weight loss program . However , none apply lifestyle modification program ( LMP ) emphasize long term lifestyle behavior change . Therefore , investigator plan conduct randomize controlled trial among Chinese OSA patient compare efficacy LMP usual clinical lifestyle advice alone improvement OSA symptom . Aim study : The investigator aim test hypothesis LMP superior lifestyle advice alone management Chinese patient OSA . The primary outcome measure change AHI . The secondary outcome measure change quality life , symptom related OSA , glucose , insulin metabolism parameter . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize OSA patient low glycemic index dietary intervention program patient receive simple lifestyle advice alone reduction AHI .</detailed_description>
