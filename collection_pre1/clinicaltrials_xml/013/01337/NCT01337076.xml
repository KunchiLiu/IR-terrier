	<brief_title>Evaluation Revised Indication Determining Adult Cochlear Implant Candidacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Existing research , discuss , support opinion current candidacy criterion set conservatively . The Sponsor , addition support recent peer review literature illustrate need appropriate criterion suitable speech recognition measure , believe appropriate time re-evaluate candidacy requirement associate adult cochlear implantation . Specifically , accomplish evaluate safety efficacy Cochlear™ Nucleus® cochlear implant system revise cochlear implant indication . The propose approach would evaluate individual score 10 - 40 % inclusively Consonant Nucleus Consonant ( CNC ) monosyllabic word meet current approve speech perception criterion widely use sentence measure Hearing In Noise Test ( HINT ) quiet . No change current qualify audiometric criterion ( bilateral moderate profound sensorineural hearing loss low frequency profound hear loss mid high speech frequency ) implant candidacy propose .</detailed_description>
