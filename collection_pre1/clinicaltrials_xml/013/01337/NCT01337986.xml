	<detailed_description>Optic neuritis ( ON ) present feature multiple sclerosis ( MS ) 15 % case , occur disease course 50 % patients.1-3 Vision remain major concern MS patient , visual dysfunction lead low quality life.4-6 Despite high prevalence ON MS , treatment management option remain limited . Although intravenous glucocorticoid employ aid recovery acute episode ON , convince evidence support efficacy alter degree long-term recovery.7 Although individual ON dramatic recovery blindness , ON often impair visual function permanently . In Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial , 63 % report vision return normal 6 month , 20 % vision worse 20/20 5 year follow-up.8 , 9 Visual impairment create difficulty home work , lead decrease independence impaired mobility within community . Visual dysfunction combination MS impairment within cerebellar proprioceptive system particularly disable . Optic neuritis classically impair one 's ability read print computer screen , drive bright low light , appreciate color contrast . Unfortunately , optic neuritis result lasting impairment , pharmacologic therapy restore vision . Low vision specialist may provide magnify glass , brighter light , advice optimize position object home workplace . Better treatment option need improve visual function . Ampyra ( dalfampridine ) potassium-channel antagonist , mechanism-of-action improve nerve conduction demyelinate axon , result electrophysiologic clinical benefit.10-22 Demyelinated axon within anterior visual pathway would prime ideal target study effect Ampyra . In fact , Stefoski et al demonstrate visual function benefit open-label study IV 4-aminopyridine 12 subjects.21 The optic nerve well-defined white-matter tract , commonly affect MS , clear clinical outcome measure . In addition , visual evoke potential ( VEPs ) include within study design secondary endpoint , confirm improve nerve conduction . Because VEPs precise , reliable , accepted measure demyelination , anterior visual pathway ideal vivo human system study electro-physiologic effect therapeutic Ampyra . Hypothesis 1 : Dalfampridine treatment improve visual function , measure 5 % ETDRS contrast sensitivity chart , subject long-term visual impairment secondary optic neuritis MS. Hypothesis 2 : Dalfampridine treatment reduce visual evoke potential P100 latency follow remote optic neuritis . Hypothesis 3 : Dalfampridine treatment result improvement secondary endpoint , include visual field , high contrast visual acuity , color vision , quality life . The study conduct Department Neurology Neurosurgery , Washington University School Medicine , St. Louis , institution Dr. Naismith base . The MS patient come 1800 active MS patient clinic 3500 St. Louis area . Fifty subject enrol Phase II , investigator-initiated , randomize blind cross-over trial dalfampridine 8 week duration ( Table 1 ) . The study test hypothesis dalfampridine , administer subject incomplete visual recovery optic neuritis MS , result symptomatic improvement visual function . The study consist one screening/baseline visit , one visit treatment active drug , one visit placebo . After baseline visit , subject randomly assign receive study medication placebo first three week , follow two week wash-out , treatment reallocation latter three week .</detailed_description>
