Specific objective ( 1 ) document treatment effect term size scope impact decontextualized well naturalistic language context , ( 2 ) document effect treatment intensity ( dosage ) , ( 3 ) explore effect sentence complexity subtype treatment outcome , ( 4 ) explore relationships treatment outcome participant variable ( pre-treatment knowledge complex sentence , verbal work memory , non-verbal cognition ) . The study utilize two design . Approximately 10 participant per year complete treatment , randomly assign one two treatment level . As participant finish , efficacy effect size measure use multiple-baseline single-subject design . Once 30 participant complete treatment , effect size impact dosage ( treatment intensity ) evaluate use pretest-posttest group design , correlation participant characteristic individual pattern performance carefully describe analyze . This study target school-age student Speech-Language Impairment and/or Specific Learning Disability age 10 14 receiving service Speech-Language Pathologist ( SLP ) one higher-level language behavior . It expect participant demonstrate high level fluency complex sentence compare pretreatment baseline level treatment effect reflect several modality naturalistic language context .</detailed_description>
