	<brief_title>Modified Video-assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery ( VATS ) Lobectomy Early-stage Non-small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>VATS ( video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ) lobectomy relatively new minimally invasive surgical treatment early-stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , associate low morbidity mortality effective oncologic result standard thoracotomy . However , surgical procedure spread widely china several reason . First , VATS surgery cost thoracotomy thoracoscopic staple ; second , procedure VATS lobectomy may difficult china lack VATS surgical equipment adjust small thoracic cavity chinese , common adhesive calcify lymph node due infection tuberculosis ; Third , surgical level VATS lobectomy far equal china , Continuing Medical Education training program thoracoscopic surgery seem less efficient without major criterion . The purpose study modify surgical technique VATS ( video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ) lobectomy early-stage non-small cell lung cancer , examine feasibility VATS lobectomy perform less staple , evaluate feasibility VATS lobectomy perform modified surgical equipment design accord experience chinese lobectomy surgery , generate chinese standard operative procedure VATS lobectomy technique learn spread . The investigator intend recruit 250 patient group , 4 group . Group A ( open group ) undergo radical lobectomy via thoracotomy approach . Group B ( standard VATS group ) undergo lobectomy via standard VATS approach introduce . Group C ( less staple group ) undergo lobectomy via VATS approach staple limitation . Group D ( modified equipment group ) undergo lobectomy via VATS approach use VATS surgical equipment design accord experience chinese lobectomy surgery . The investigator compare two group patient follow : A vs. B , B vs. C , B vs. D .</detailed_description>
