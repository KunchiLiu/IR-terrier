	<brief_summary>Patients type 1 diabetes risk low blood sugar level ( hypoglycaemia ) severe side effect insulin therapy , particular subject lose warn hypoglycaemia . During hypoglycaemia low frequent activity see electroencephalography ( EEG ) cognitive function decline . The purpose study investigate activity brain , cognitive function , skin temperature patient expose repeat hypoglycaemia . The result show whether response hypoglycaemia change repeat episode . It hope result contribute improved understanding hypoglycaemic EEG change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Patients type 1 diabetes risk severe hypoglycaemia severe side effect insulin therapy , particular subject lose warn hypoglycaemia ( hypoglycaemia unawareness ) . The episode associate impaired quality life lead permanent brain damage death . During hypoglycaemia low frequent activity see electroencephalography ( EEG ) cognitive function decline . Repeated hypoglycaemic episode result regulation counter regulatory symptomatic response . It know whether similar phenomenon present cerebral dysfunction judge EEG change cognitive function . The purpose investigate activity brain , cognitive function , skin temperature patient expose repeat hypoglycaemia . The result show whether response hypoglycaemia change repeat episode . The method : The investigator recruit two group patient : Patients hypoglycemia awareness patient hypoglycaemic unawareness . The patient expose hypoglycaemia two concomitant day investigator record EEG perform cognitive test . Skin temperature assess use thermography . If patient hypoglycaemic unawareness 4 week period follow glycaemic control loosen avoid hypoglycaemia episodes patient expose hypoglycaemia . The prospect : It investigators hope result contribute improved understanding hypoglycaemic EEG change skin temperature change . This could potential benefit patient hypoglycaemic unawareness .</detailed_description>
