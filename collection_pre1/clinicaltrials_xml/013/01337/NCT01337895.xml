	<brief_summary>- Objectives Taking 'whole food ' approach , investigate ( ) whether consumption isocaloric diet contain ≥4 vs. ≤1 serving dairy product per day 16 week result great body fat loss energy-restricted overweight/obese premenopausal woman ; ( ii ) role dairy product consumption influence physiological metabolic factor may precede accompany change body composition , include enzyme synthesize break body fat ; ( iii ) factor , include obesity phenotype , may influence response body composition dairy product consumption . - Background With obesity epidemic showing sign abate , ongoing interest , lay public scientific level , manipulate diet promote weight , specifically fat , loss . One promising manipulation increase , perhaps precisely , isocaloric substitution , dairy product consumption . The inverse association Body Mass Index ( BMI ) dietary calcium - dairy product main source - first describe 1984 since support various level evidence , consistently . Heaney recently describe literature `` confuse , '' Rafferty attribute important limitation study design , include lack low-calcium contrast group fact body weight/body composition often secondary endpoint study design powered different outcome , typically bone health blood pressure . Confusion also arise investigation different intervention ( dairy product , dairy calcium , dietary calcium , supplemental calcium ) , make difficult compare interpret study . This create opportunity propose Dairy Weight Loss ( DAWL ) study , focus whole dairy product consumption , help clear confusion surround issue . **Hypotheses Overweight/obese , low habitual dairy consuming , premenopausal woman randomize energy-restricted weight loss diet contain ≥4 servings/day dairy product ( milk , yogurt , cheese ) 16 week lose body fat randomize isocaloric diet contain ≤1 servings/day dairy product .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>`` Ground zero '' DAWL study University Guelph Body Composition Metabolism Lab ( www.uoguelph.ca/bodycomp ) , direction PI . Sample Size . The investigator plan complete data collection total 46 woman . This sample size base anticipated total body fat mass ( FM ) loss 16 week 5.5 kg high dairy group 3.8 kg control group . These value base data publish 4 study ( 5 ; 20-22 ) . To conservative sample size calculation , use higher-than-reported SD 2.0 kg FM loss . Together , value indicate require 23 woman group detect significant difference total body FM , 80 % power 5 % alpha . Attrition non-adherence anticipate approximately 20 % 25 % , therefore 30 woman group recruit . We anticipate screen approximately 300+ woman collect 16 week data total 46 eligible adherent completers , per Figure 1 . Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria . Inclusion criterion include non-smoking , non-pregnant non-lactating woman 18 50 year ; premenopausal ( determined cessation menstruation recent menstrual history exclude perimenopausal amennorheic ) ; BMI ≥25.0 kg/m2 ( 54 ) ; usual calcium consumption EAR 800 mg/d ( 55 ) measure use validated calcium vitamin D food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) ( 56 ) ; sensitivity dairy ; normal liver kidney function , serum calcium , complete blood count ; 3 mo history weight stability ; willingness adhere study protocol 16 week regardless treatment , include change physical activity level . Any vitamin/mineral supplement user ask discontinue supplementation 4 week prior enrol trial ( i.e . `` wash '' ) , well duration trial . Exclusion criterion include violation , presence health condition might influence weight loss ( diabetes , CVD , cancer , thyroid disease ) regularly take medication may ( corticosteroid ) . Comprehensive Screening/Background Data Collection Visit . Women pass initial screen attend recruitment session invite back lab , fast 12 hour ( food drink except water ) , first ask sign inform consent form . Further screening/background data collect include : - Biochemistry include complete blood count , liver function test ( ALT , AST ) , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , serum total calcium . Participants undergo venipuncture LifeLabs phlebotomist ( letter support attach ) . A 3 business day turnaround anticipated result . Participants value within normal limit continue enrollment . By stage recruitment , participant know health conditions/medications suspect interfere study outcome screen , therefore anticipated value within normal limit . - International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) ( 57 ) assess usual activity habit . - Resting metabolic rate ( kcal/d ) determine energy level individualize meal plan , calculate ( RMR x PAL ) - 500 kcal/d . RMR measure use continuous open-circuit indirect calorimetry use MAX-IIa instrument ( AEI Technologies Inc. ) . RMR measurement conduct participant lie awake complete physical rest , ventilate hood place head neck . Participants undergo measurement 30 40 minute ; first 5 10 minute data discard allow acclimation test environment . We provide juice box granola bar test participant hungry . For consistency across study visit , measure participant follicular phase menstrual cycle . 14.5 Lead-In Phase During two week follow comprehensive screen visit , participant ask maintain 3-day food record , research personnel create 500 kcal-restricted individualize meal plan describe . From point , participant ask maintain usual physical activity level . 14.6 Study Diets Participants provide individualized meal plan - high dairy control - every two week duration study . They counsel assign diet research personnel baseline visit throughout study . The energy level meal plan ( e.g . 1200 kcal , 1400 kcal , 1600 kcal , etc ) determine RMR PAL level follow : ( RMR x PAL ) - 500 kcal/d , RMR rest metabolic rate ( kcal/d , measure indirect calorimetry ) , PAL physical activity level derive screen IPAQ 500 kcal daily energy restriction . The energy level adjust throughout study need . Actual food meal plan base Eating Well Canada 's Food Guide ( EWCFG , http : //www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/food-guide-aliment/index-eng.php ) 3-day food record complete lead-in phase . The diet two treatment group match energy macronutrient ( protein , fat , carbohydrate ) intake per sample 1400 kcal meal plan attach , use ESHA Food Processor SQL ( version 10.8.0 , ESHA Research , Salem OR ) update 2010 Canadian Nutrient File . Dairy product high dairy group donate Agropur Coopérative Ultima Foods ( letter support attach ) . Consistent EWCFG recommendation , variety dairy product ( milk , yogurt , cheese ) include . One serving consider 1 cup fluid white cow 's milk chocolate milk ; 1.5 ounce cheese ; 1 cup yogurt . Although EWCFG considers 1 serve yogurt 0.75 cup , increase 1 cup provide equivalent calcium across dairy product . Minimum dairy calcium intake high-dairy group anticipate 1200 mg/d ; dietary calcium intake high . Dietary calcium control group anticipate &lt; 450 mg/d , therefore anticipate spread approximately 1000 mg dietary calcium per day group . If energy level meal plan allow , incorporate regular fat ( vs. low fat ) dairy product reflect Canadians ' actual dairy intake maximize intake CLA . Participants high-dairy group provide 2 week supply dairy product time , insulate transport bag . 14.7 Baseline Visit ( week 0 ) Following lead-in , participant return lab baseline visit . At time , participant first inform treatment randomly assign biostatistician ( use random number generator ) ask adhere 16 week . We divulge prior go , provide opportunity participant withdraw . Willing participant undergo series measurement : - Weight describe . - Waist circumference measure twice stand participant level iliac crest ( 58 ) use Gulick II non-elastic tape measure ; measure differ &gt; 5 % , third take mean two close value use . Hip circumference measure twice stand participant around wide portion buttock ( 59 ) ; measure differ &gt; 5 % , third take mean two close value use . Predominantly android obesity define waist-to-hip ratio &gt; 0.85 , predominantly gynoid obesity define waist-to-hip ratio ≤0.85 ( 59 , 60 ) . - Body composition . Whole body regional fat mass lean mass measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) use fan beam Hologic Wi update APEX 3.2 software . See Figure 2 . Participants ask wear underpants hospital gown , remove metal jewelry , test - Venipuncture . A LifeLabs phlebotomist draw fast blood sample participant . Biochemical analysis complete LifeLabs include glucose , insulin , 25 ( OH ) D , lipid ( total cholesterol ; HDL ; LDL ; triglyceride ) , high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) . Various CLA isomer ( c9 , t11 ; t10 , c12 ) red blood cell ( Dr. David Ma ) , hepatic lipase , lipoprotein lipase mRNA expression fatty acid synthase ( Dr. Marica Bakovic ) analyze yearly batch University Guelph . Participants require fast visit ; provide juice box granola bar afterwards . - Visual analog scale ( VAS ) ass desire eat , hunger , fullness prospective food consumption ( 61 ) . Scales 100 mm length anchor either end word express positive negative rating . The VAS complete lab conference room venipuncture . - Sitting blood pressure use digital blood pressure cuff ( Physio Logic model 106-94 , Montréal PQ ) . 14.8 Mid-Study Visit ( week 8 ) Participants repeat follow test : weight , waist/hip circumference , DXA , rest metabolic rate , blood pressure . 14.9 Study Conclusion ( week 16 ) Participants repeat test Baseline Visit . 14.10 Adherence Interim Visits Throughout trial , participant maintain daily dairy product intake checklist weekly food activity diary determine adherence treatment group , energy intake physical activity . Biweekly , participant visit lab turn checklist ; meal plan reassess ; weight , BMI waist/hip circumference measure . Those dairy group pick 2 week supply dairy product . Participants complete monthly calcium vitamin D FFQ ( 56 ) . 14.11 Data Analysis Repeated measure ANOVA conduct measure collect two time point , determine difference treatment group . These include : body composition ( DXA , weight , BMI , waist/hip circumference ) , dietary data , physical activity , rest metabolic rate , visual analog scale blood pressure . Consistent pre/post design , pair t-tests determine difference biochemical variable measure week 0 16 . Regression analysis use predict kilogram fat mass lose , predictor variable include obesity phenotype ( predominantly android vs. predominantly gynoid adjusted difference BMI ) , baseline 25 ( OH ) D status , age , etc . 14.12 Knowledge Translation Community , provincial national outreach consumer , Registered Dietitians ( RD ) , health care professional , scientist achieve multiple mean : - Gwen Laughton Janine Robertson , Guelph-based RD collaborator , provide KT assistance specifically tailor local context . This include presentation discussion group Guelph-based RDs assist health literacy consumer , dissemination via Waterloo Wellington Regional Nutrition Network . We also post study web-based Ontario Nutrition Resource Centre , initiative Ontario Public Health Association . - The DAWL study post Canadian Inventory Nutrition Dietetic Associated Research ( CINDAR ) Canadian Obesity Network ( CON ) websites , `` Members Action '' section Dietitians Canada newsletter .
