	<detailed_description>Does exposure aerosol induce airway inflammation and/or systemic inflammatory response worker silicon carbide ( SiC ) processing industry ? As yet , human study describe health effect exposure recycle slurry contain SiC and/or PEG report . However , several study may relevant assess health effect particle . It demonstrate small particle penetrate lung large particle thereby strong irritate property [ 2 ] . Results 2 experimental study effect variable lung function , organ weight characteristic broncho-alveolar lavage ( BAL ) [ 3 , 4 ] indicate SiC dust PEG probably relatively inert . However , third study demonstrate SiC particles potential stimulate test cell ( murine macrophage cell line human osteoblast-like cell line ) produce inflammatory signal substance ( tumour necrosis factor ( TNF ) -alfa ) , indicate possible inflammatory response lung [ 5 ] . Furthermore , think total amount inhale dust important ( `` overload '' ) even substance relatively inert [ 6 ] . Repeated high exposure ( peak ) may act reinforce factor . Because previous study , available data conflicting , need knowledge association health effect exposure particles general exposure SiC processing industry particular . Our hypothesis airway inflammation may induce exposure SiC particle would probably detectable increased level inflammatory cell soluble inflammatory marker sputum blood sample non-smoking , asymptomatic worker . The primary aim present study worker expose SiC dust work-place determine whether exposure associate inflammatory change lung . The secondary aim : - examine possible change systemic inflammatory marker , - examine change lung function among SiC-processing worker period 3 year . Possible change lung function monitor spirometry measurement ( study A ) . Airway inflammatory response change circulate inflammatory marker assess examination induce sputum sample blood sample subgroup worker ( study B ) . General value An important goal study provide knowledge important worker expose particle aerosols SiC-processing industry industry process SiC and/or PEG . The study may also relevant worker industry dusty environment give possible `` overload '' mechanism . The study could possibly also potential provide additional knowledge effect exposure similar particle e.g air pollution . Because former study use induced sputum prospective design , study particular interest . If early sign lung inflammation decrease lung function demonstrate present study , necessary implement additional measure reduce dust level industry ; e.g. , enclosure process . The investigator believe result study together exist knowledge inflammatory effect associate occupational exposure particle may relevant prevention chronic respiratory disease . III - Study design method Study population In present study , effect exposure aerosols airway inflammation systemic inflammation investigate mean spirometry , FeNO , induce sputum blood sample three-year period . Study A : The whole group worker complete questionnaire respiratory symptom undergo spirometry baseline , 3 year . All former worker contact ask complete questionnaire ass proportion worker resign ( partly ) health effect . These worker also invite undergo examination lung function ( spirometry ) . This ensure worker ever employ include study population . Study B : A subgroup comprise non-smokers addition follow blood sample , induce sputum test exposure measurement every 6 month time period . Controls : Exposed subject compare non- low-exposed subject ( administrative/office worker ) . In addition prospective study , investigator compare baseline finding sputum blood sample already establish external control group previous study healthy non-exposed worker cement production worker geographic area [ 7 ] . Exposure-response analysis : Workers divide group different exposure level order study exposure-response trend measure agent expose population ( design less vulnerable selection effect ) . Baseline examination repeat subject sputum subgroup . Detailed , validated questionnaire record medical history , relevant illness , use medication , occupational history well present exposure . Spirometry allow registration lung function FeNO measurement monitor possible airway inflammation . A group-based strategy apply collection exposure measurement baseline follow-up ( 3 year ) subject include sputum part study . Induced sputum collection apply detect possible change inflammatory cell soluble marker airway . Blood analysis collect examine possible change circulate inflammatory marker association exposure . All participant sputum subgroup carry individual exposure measurement . The employee leave cohort contribute data employ ( defined time-at-risk ) drop-out test perform determine whether experienced work-related respiratory symptom disease . New employee include study period assign time-at-risk equal time exposure . Exposure measurement assessment The dust/aerosol sample collect use thoracic inhale respirable cyclone estimate dos deposition bronchus alveolus . Validity Factors may affect lung function inflammatory marker sputum Age , height , BMI sex record study . Height meter enter computer program calculate spirometry value . Weight ( body mass index ) affect lung function measure examination . The investigator also record possible acute respiratory infection precede 12 month . An upper respiratory infection precede three week may affect level inflammatory cell marker sputum . There possibility early inflammatory effect among worker could succeed adaptation thereby reduction effect . In case , inflammatory response time employment could small observe initially . This may lead underestimation effect . The investigator consider dynamic cohort design include subject expose first time industry feasible . However , follow-up three year consider sufficient detect clinically relevant change . The cohort study also relatively short prior employment industry plant open 2006 2009 . Spirometry screen worker , perform first day employment local health service , available . These compare baseline recording evaluate possible effect prior inclusion present study . Statistical analysis study power The association study individual change effect variable : - trend study period ( study A : baseline 36 month whole group worker ; study B sputum subgroup : baseline , 6 , 12 , 24 36 month ) , - expose control ( expose unexposed/administrative staff/office worker ) baseline difference trend study period . T test use compare case control baseline normally distributed variable , Mann-Whitney test non-normally distributed variable . Where multiple test conduct , ANOVA Kruskal-Wallis test apply prior pairwise comparison determine overall significance level . Multiple regression model adjustment age , sex , smoke habit relevant factor analysis apply adjust factor baseline . To analyse repeated measure , general linear model ( GLM ) mix model use . The power calculation base clinically interesting difference percentage neutrophil spirometry value . The study design include least 20 participant group base power estimate 90 % , assumes 95 % significance level , detect true difference percentage neutrophils two test least 16 % . Power calculation FEV1 FVC % predict : goal detect difference 1.5 % FEV1 FVC % predict , give standard deviation 5 % sample must consist 117 person group . This ensure 90 % power detect difference 5 % significance level . It expect response rate among non-smokers allow approximately 40 employee 20 unexposed worker include sputum part study ( study B ) . Based power calculation , prior experience publish study , enough detect difference development two group expect magnitude . In total , 150 worker employed SiC I II ( include study A ) . It plan include employee Glomfjord ( Nordland ) SiC process sample size Porsgrunn sufficient . To ensure sufficient unexposed worker , neighbour Renewable Energy Corporation ( REC ) plant use recruit control need . The REC plant start production time similar work-force study group . VI - Ethical aspect It consider purpose study method use violate generally accept ethical value . Participation project voluntary . Collection biological material information take place participant ' consent . All participant sign consent form receive write information survey . Participants time opportunity withdraw study without give reason . According agreement SIC- processing , research fellow project group freely publish result survey . The project financially dependent grant industry , industry ( SIC ) financing project limited exposure monitoring .</detailed_description>
