	<brief_summary>In treatment advanced cancer , maximize quality life ( QoL ) fundamental goal oncologists patient . In order achieve goal , form systematic reliable QoL assessment need routine clinical practice evaluate impact advance cancer treatment QoL . The Lung Cancer Symptom Scale ( LCSS ) validate site-specific QoL measure design use patient lung cancer undergo treatment . Recently develop electronic form use hand-held pocket personal computer ( pc ) enhance collection presentation QoL assessments clinical trial patient care . This study evaluate impact computer-generated QoL ( LCSS-QL ) assessment treatment practice advance lung cancer patient use randomized trial design . The investigator hypothesize Computer-Generated Quality Life Assessment Program positively impact treatment pattern patient lung cancer . Specifically , investigator hypothesize : 1 . Use LCSS-QL increase accelerate referral use palliative care service ; 2 . Use LCSS-QL decrease duration palliative chemotherapy treatment early identification lack benefit patient ; 3 . Use LCSS-QL may decrease use image test assess objective tumor response indicator treatment benefit . Maximizing quality life one important goal palliative chemotherapy treatment advance lung cancer . If simple practical tool demonstrate improve palliative management patient , include optimize duration chemotherapy use palliative supportive service base patient QoL response , dramatically improve quality care provide advanced lung cancer patient . This study also provide springboard way incorporate computer-generated QoL measurement treatment decision-making advance cancer patient , include tumor type advance breast colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computer-Generated Quality Life Assessment Program Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients ( LUNL2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design The study conduct use unblinded , randomized trial design . Patients start systemic therapy advance NSCLC invite complete LCSS-QL upon start first-line systemic chemotherapy prior subsequent treatment visit ( every 3 week ) . Patients randomized baseline whether physician receive information time clinic visit duration study participation . Randomization code generate computer program , stratification physician , platinum-based versus non-platinum base therapy Eastern Cooperative Group Performance Status 0 1 versus 2 3 . All patient complete LCSS-QL baseline , begin cycle chemotherapy , follow visit disease progression ( initiation subsequent therapy ) discontinue clinic visit expect average 12 18 week . Patient Population All NSCLC patient advance disease ( Stage 3B 4 ) start systemic therapy Princess Margaret Hospital eligible participate . Inclusion criterion include physical ability use hand-held instrument ( adequate vision , manual dexterity ) , provision write informed consent , write fluency English , French , Italian , Spanish , Portuguese Chinese . Patients exclude unable complete understand assessment process , receive concurrent radical radiotherapy . Physician Information Physicians train interpretation LCSS electronic output data , order facilitate interpretation different domain patient well-being , example pain score . An endorsement sheet print addition LCSS data , highlight major change quality life . For example , deterioration pain control highlight suggestion increase change pain medication , consider radiotherapy pain management option , include change systemic therapy . Outcomes Endpoints include palliative care referral rate , duration systemic therapy , use supportive intervention QoL treatment . Data number chemotherapy cycle administer , referral palliative care ( include timing ) , institution additional supportive treatment , number imaging test order collected patient prospectively . Data LCSS score , subsequent therapy , date death also record .</detailed_description>
