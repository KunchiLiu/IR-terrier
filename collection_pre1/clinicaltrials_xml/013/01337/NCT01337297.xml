	<brief_summary>The use crack-cocaine grow alarm rate country absolutely worrisome fast establishment addiction . Its immediate effect , intense extremely fleeting , increase dramatically probability drug consume , settle quickly loss control compulsive use , turn effect drug highly addictive . Parallel process , brain damage quickly establish , progress severe impairment frontal function , lead lack cognitive control feed back aggravates dependence , hamper therapeutic approach . The exist treatment prove satisfactory yet . Thus , consider new modality treatment , base neuromodulation induce noninvasive brain stimulation , useful treat various neuropsychiatric condition , study examine potential beneficial effect repeat transcranial Direct Current Stimulation leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex treatment crack-cocaine addiction .</brief_summary>

After select refer Laboratory Cognitive Science Neuropsychopharmacology Postgraduate Program Physiological Sciences Health Sciences Center Federal University Esp√≠rito Santo semi-randomly ( match age , gender sociodemographic characteristic ) distribute two different group : ( A ) sham-tDCS ( n = 20 ) ( B ) active-tDCS ( n = 20 ) ; follow 10 application daily session , except weekend , transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS , 5 x 7 cm2 , 2 mA , 20 min ) leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex sham procedure . Event-related potential ( ERP ) record , brain stimulation sham procedure random presentation three relate image three non-related image crack use . The compulsive behavior evaluate ERP record . Cognitive test assess mental function , frontal function , visuospatial verbal work memory , inhibition , conflict resolution perform .
