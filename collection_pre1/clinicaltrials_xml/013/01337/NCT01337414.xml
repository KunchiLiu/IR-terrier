	<brief_summary>Exudative age-related macular degeneration ( `` wet '' AMD ) continue lead cause central vision loss US fifty year age , despite availability several effective intervention contain damaging neovascularization ( new , abnormal blood vessel growth ) . The effectiveness treatment challenge patient ' lack ability recognize need urgent care regular office visit . The Amsler Yanuzzi test , widely use self-tests AMD , proven largely ineffective enable patient recognize sign consult retina specialist treatment . For optimal benefit , patient able self-monitor vision time detect change may indicative exudative event . To facilitate compliance observation part large engage program AMD awareness self-monitoring . Among principal shortcoming current `` gold-standard '' Amsler grid periodicity test pattern lack individual adjustment , therefore reliability accuracy test less optimal detection exudative retinal change AMD patient . In phase I current study , investigatorsW develop evaluated several version improve grid , paper Internet . These patent-pending Visual Memory Stimulating ( VMS ) grid prove least equivalent Amsler grid facilitate substantial degree recall prior measurement , necessary monitoring vision time . Adjustment feature incorporate on-line version allow patient customize grid particular visual field . In phase II study use VMS grid supplement test booklet contain educational material diary base survey question addition print VMS grid ; effectiveness booklet self-monitoring compare standard care ( Amsler grid ) . Goal study demonstrate use test booklet lead rapid identification newly develop vision problem , early diagnosis treatment incipient wet AMD result few people lose vision le severe loss vision .</brief_summary>
