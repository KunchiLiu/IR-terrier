	<brief_summary>This randomize controlled trial comparing effectiveness three hand hygiene protocol , routine inpatient clinical care : Protocol 1 : handrubbing alcohol cover hand surface particular order ; Protocol 2 : handrubbing alcohol use WHO standard 7-step technique ; Protocol 3 : handwashing chlorhexidine use WHO standard 7-step technique . The main study hypothesis alcohol hand-rubbing cover hand surface less effective reduce bacterial hand contamination healthcare staff alcohol hand-rubbing use 7-step technique ; effective chlorhexidine handwashing . The secondary study hypothesis time spend alcohol hand-rubbing cover hand surface less required 2 hand hygiene protocol respectively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Alcohol Hand-rubbing Covering All Hand Surfaces Reducing Bacterial Hand Contamination Healthcare Staff</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background 1 . The hospital environment conducive rapid spread pathogen , especially antimicrobial-resistant bacteria . Hospital-acquired methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) vancomycin-resistant enterococci ( VRE ) infection increase worldwide , include Singapore . 2 . Good hand hygiene single important measure prevent nosocomial spread pathogen healthcare setting . However , study report compliance rate &lt; 50 % , routine hospital practice . The last hand hygiene audit TTSH reveal compliance rate merely 20 % . Recent study observe level compliance would reduce transmission risk multi-resistant bacteria hospital . A high workload insufficient time hand hygiene common reason cite healthcare worker poor compliance hand hygiene . 3 . Hospital staff responsible 20-40 % nosocomial spread pathogen patient patient contact transmission . Bacterial contamination healthcare worker ' hand routine patient care report increase linearly time , average increase 16 colony-forming unit ( CFUs ) per minute patient care . 4 . The use alcohol handrubs demonstrate significantly reduce time spent hand hygiene ( 40-80 second require hand-washing v 20 second alcohol hand-rubbing ) . Although grow evidence experimental study alcohol-based product effective soap antimicrobial soap , trial do clinical set evaluate two hand hygiene protocol everyday practice . 5 . A randomised control trial carry 3 intensive care unit ( ICUs ) 940-bedded French tertiary care referral university hospital demonstrate superior antimicrobial efficacy alcohol hand-rubbing compare chlorhexidine hand-washing . The median percentage reduction bacterial contamination significantly high alcohol hand-rubbing hand-washing ( 83 % vs 58 % , p = 0.012 ) . Another randomise clinical trial involve 4 general ward 3 ICUs 850-bedded University Barcelona Hospital demonstrate similar finding . It report average reduction hand bacterial load 88.2 % alcoholic hand-wash , compare 49.6 % regular liquid soap . 6 . Since introduction alcohol handrubs Tan Tock Seng Hospital ( TTSH ) , hospital adopt hand hygiene guideline issue Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) . The CDC guideline specifically discuss technique use alcohol-based handrubs . However , recent World Health Organization ( WHO ) 's Guidelines Hand Hygiene Health Care ( Advanced Draft ) April 2006 detail hand hygiene technique alcohol-based formulation . WHO 's recommend alcohol hand-rubbing technique involve standard 7-steps adopt hand-washing antiseptic soap water . 7 . Busy healthcare staff often unable adhere 7-step hand hygiene technique . Hence , convenient hand hygiene protocol would hand-rubbing alcohol , cover hand surface dry , recommend CDC . This protocol currently adopt TTSH . However , grow concern could miss area hand alcohol hand-rubbing , might affect efficacy alcohol handrub [ 20 , 21 ] . 8 . There publish clinical study compare efficacy alcohol hand-rubbing antiseptic hand-washing healthcare worker routine patient care . To knowledge , publish international study compare CDC 's recommended alcohol hand-rubbing protocol WHO 's . This study provide important information efficacy alcohol hand-rubbing use current technique adopt TTSH ( CDC 's guideline ) , compare WHO 's recommended 7-step technique alcohol hand-rubbing standard 7-step chlorhexidine hand-washing respectively . This study also provide local data actual time spend hand hygiene , everyday practice . The finding study contribute significantly towards understand hand hygiene practice routine patient care local healthcare set hence guide infection control strategies reduce hospital-acquired infection . Reducing hospital-acquired infection would lead improved clinical outcome patient . Study Hypothesis : 9 . Alcohol hand-rubbing cover hand surface less effective reduce bacterial hand contamination healthcare staff alcohol hand-rubbing use 7-step technique ; effective chlohexidine handwash . Time spent alcohol hand-rubbing cover hand surface less required 2 hand hygiene protocol respectively . Objectives 10 . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy 3 hand hygiene protocol : hand-rubbing alcohol cover hand surface , hand-rubbing alcohol use standard 7-step technique , hand-washing chlorhexidine use standard 7-step technique . The secondary objective include estimation time spend hand hygiene , hand hygiene protocol ; evaluation bacterial hand contamination key patient care activity . Methods 11 . This study prospective randomise controlled trial , blind evaluation microbiological result . Three hand hygiene protocol compare : hand-rubbing alcohol cover hand surface , hand-rubbing alcohol use standard 7-step technique , hand-washing chlorhexidine use standard 7-step technique . 12 . Medical nursing staff general ward TTSH invite participate study . 60 medical staff ( namely medical officer house officer ) 60 nursing staff ( namely register nurse enrolled nurse ) recruit study . The medical nursing team work select ward inform study prior commencement , support respective unit department head seek . An information sheet describe study circulate prior study . 13 . The study carry 8 week , day shift , Monday Friday . Two infection control nurse research associate work team , move systematically one ward next . On day study , team observe patient care activity participate ward , look activity involve direct patient contact ( physical examination , temperature blood pressure take ) , without use glove . 14 . Whenever medical nursing staff perform activity involve direct patient contact without use glove , staff approach invited participate study . Verbal consent take staff accept invitation participate . To protect identity confidentiality participate staff , write consent take . 15 . Three sample bacterial count take dominant hand participant : prior patient contact , patient contact , hand hygiene . 16 . Each participant randomly assign one 3 hand hygiene protocol : - hand-rubbing alcohol cover hand surface , - hand-rubbing alcohol use standard 7-step technique , - hand-washing chlorhexidine use standard 7-step technique . Pre-prepared seal envelope use . Participants allocate hand hygiene protocol ( 1 ) ( 3 ) ask perform hand hygiene method , normally would . Participants assign hand hygiene protocol ( 2 ) request perform hand-rubbing alcohol , use technique would normally adopt chlorhexidine hand-washing . 17 . The two infection control nurse separately monitor time take participant patient care activity use stopwatch , record duration type patient care perform data collection form . The data collection form contain study number bear name identification participant . A study number randomly assign participant use pre-numbered data collection form . Similarly , infection control nurse observe record duration hand hygiene note adherence allocate hand hygiene technique . The infection control nurse make observation , interfere hand hygiene whatever method use . ( Pls see attach data collection form ) 18 . Participants assign one 2 alcohol hand-rubbing protocol whose hand become visibly soiled patient care , advise perform chlorhexidine hand-washing instead . 19 . The research associate , undergone training sampling technique , responsible take hand sample bacterial count , use glove juice technique . Samples label study number . Innoculated agar plate incubate 37 degC aerobic condition . The total bacterial contamination hand term number colony form unit ( cfu ) record 48 hour incubation . Bacteria present sample also qualitatively identify report . The microbiologist examine culture plat report microbiological result blind hand hygiene method use . 20 . Each staff approach . The time take sample collection less minute . The study team ensure study interfere routine patient care activity . 21 . Strict confidentiality participant maintain . All data collect , include microbiological result , identify study number trace participating staff .</detailed_description>
