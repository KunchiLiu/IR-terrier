	<brief_summary>The objective study examine COPD-related outcome patient comorbid depression/anxiety combination fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate compare receive anticholinergic . The prevalence comorbid depression/anxiety patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) estimate high range 10-40 % , give risk depression/anxiety symptom almost 3 time high patient versus without COPD . Additionally , patient comorbid COPD depression/anxiety high COPD-related healthcare utilization cost compare without depression/anxiety . Therapy maintenance medication COPD recommend prevent future adverse COPD outcome , impact initiate intervention yet evaluate higher-risk population comorbid COPD-depression/anxiety . The present study compare risk COPD exacerbation COPD-related cost patient initiate maintenance medication treatment COPD comorbid COPD/depression-anxiety population . Maintenance medication include inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) , long-acting beta agonist ( LABA ) , combination drug product ICS+LABA , anti-cholinergics ( AC ) include tiotropium ( TIO ) ipratropium combination ipratropium-albuterol ( collectively abbreviate IPR ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This retrospective cohort study use large administrative database ( study period : 1/1/2003 6/30/2009 ) . Date first FSC ACs ( tiotropium ; ipratropium alone combination albuterol ) define index date . Managed care enrollee ( age &gt; 40 year ) least one medical claim primary diagnosis COPD ( ICD code 491.xx , 492.xx 496.xx ) diagnosis depression ( least one claim depression/anxiety least one prescription claim depression/anxiety ) one-year pre-index within 60-days post-index define comorbid population . Patients continuously eligible throughout one-year pre post-index period . Negative binomial model use analyze number COPD-related event [ hospitalization ( IP ) , emergency department ( ED ) , office visit oral steroid and/or antibiotic prescription within 5 day ( OV+Rx ) ] logistic regression use examine risk COPD event two cohort . COPD-related cost compare two cohort use - generalize linear model log-link/gamma distribution adjust baseline difference . Specifically study hypothesis primary outcome test : Ho : There difference risk COPD-related exacerbation FSC AC cohorts Ha : There difference risk COPD-related exacerbation FSC AC cohorts Hypothesis key secondary outcome COPD-related cost test : Ho : There difference COPD-related cost FSC AC cohorts Ha : There difference COPD-related cost FSC AC cohort</detailed_description>
