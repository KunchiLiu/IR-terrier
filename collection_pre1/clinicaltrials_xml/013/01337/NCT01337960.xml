	<detailed_description>Veterans Americans survive stroke often face disable motor impairment impede performance activity daily live limit free-living activity . Prominent among diminished locomotor function impair balance foster sedentary lifestyle physical deconditioning , also increase risk injury due fall . Recent research demonstrate motor learning base intervention modify brain activity improve motor function person stroke . Now major research opportunity advance effectiveness intervention apply new robotics technology improve neuromotor control essential function gait balance . One critical area performance walk stand balance control ankle , major conduit mechanical power gait also modulate torque affect motion whole body center mass balancing . Thus current proposal design investigate two approach use impedance control ankle robot improve gait balance function among stroke survivor chronic low extremity hemiparesis . One approach use ankle robot seat visuomotor training program focus improve paretic ankle motor control may transfer gait balance function . The approach follow dominant rehabilitation paradigm task-specific training integrating use ankle robot treadmill exercise training ass effect outcomes . The effectiveness robotics approach compare treadmill exercise program without robotics . The study test hypothesis , person chronic low extremity hemiparesis , 6 week seat ankle robot training improve paretic ankle motor control major improvement stand balance moderate improvement gait , whereas amount training treadmill ankle robot improve gait function balance . Both robot-trained group outperform treadmill group balance , treadmill + robot group make great gain gait seat robot group make improvement gait show great gain ankle motor control balance . Aims : In 6-week intervention ( 18 session ) person chronic low extremity hemiparesis 1 ) Compare effect seat visuomotor ankle robot training vs. treadmill + robot train paretic ankle impairment motor control ; 2 ) Compare effect seated-robot vs. treadmill + robot train functional mobility balance outcome ; 3 ) Compare effectiveness robotics approach standard treadmill exercise protocol duration . This proposal establish initial comparative efficacy two motor learn base approach use modular impedance control ankle robot contrast motor control functional gait balance outcome among . As pilot study also establish initial deficit profile user respond intervention across 6-week period .</detailed_description>
