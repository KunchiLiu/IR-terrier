Moreover , preliminary data obtain Hollander colleague suggest OT may value treat core autism symptom . Specifically , synthetic oxytocin administer via intravenous infusion adult autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) produce significant reduction repetitive behavior facilitate social cognition/memory double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over laboratory challenge . Encouraged finding , primary aim study investigate safety therapeutic efficacy intranasal OT treat repetitive behavior social functioning/cognitive deficit adult ASD . This research embrace translational approach develop novel treatment core ASD symptom ; give currently Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve medication treatment core ASD symptom , research address important unmet need field . The goal study evaluate safety efficacy repeat Intranasal Oxytocin Treatment ( INOT ) administration adult ASD .</brief_summary>
