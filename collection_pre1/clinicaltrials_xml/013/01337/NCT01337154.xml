	<brief_summary>The goal study determine progression-free survival objective response rate subject either stage IIIB pleural effusion NSCLC stage IV NSCLC treat six cycle paclitaxel plus carboplatin either tamibarotene placebo . Subjects randomly assign receive tamibarotene , 6 mg/m2 , divide twice daily orally , equal number match placebo tablet , start 1 week chemotherapy continue 6 cycle beyond . Subjects assessed response Day 50 , Day 113 , every month use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) .</brief_summary>
