	<brief_title>Recombinant Anti-tumor Anti-virus Protein Injection Treatment Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Explanation study design The trial include two stage . The first exploration stage decide delivery frequency dose study drug . It single-blinded , subject randomly divide 4 group 2:2:2:1 ratio . Study drug give twice per week 3 time per , dose drug 20μg 40μg . The sample size 105 , duration 12 18 month . Based preliminary efficacy safety , good dosage regimen decide second stage.The second stage double-blinded , subject randomly divide treatment group placebo group 2:1 ratio sample size 600 . Primary purpose To compare overall survival study drug placebo group . Secondary purpose 1 . Progression free survival compare group . 2 . Disease control rate compare group . 3 . Quality life score compare group . 4 . Determine safety tolerance recombinant anti-tumor anti-virus protein injection 5 . Supplementary pharmacodynamics recombinant anti-tumor anti-virus protein injection Exploratory purpose Evaluate effect recombinant anti-tumor anti-virus protein injection anti-tumor immunity , angiogenesis , apoptosis , cell proliferation , immune cell cytokine level .</detailed_description>
