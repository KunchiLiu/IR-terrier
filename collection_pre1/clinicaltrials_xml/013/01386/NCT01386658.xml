	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic , Tolerability Safety Study Icatibant Children Adolescents With Hereditary Angioedema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study HGT-FIR-086 enroll 30 subject 2 less 18 year age , divide 2 group : prepubertal pubertal/postpubertal . At least 10 prepubertal child least 20 adolescent ( include 10 treated HAE attack ) must enrol study . After qualify screening period , PK , safety/tolerability , efficacy treatment SC icatibant evaluate least 20 subject ( 10 prepubertal 10 pubertal/postpubertal subject ) present cutaneous , abdominal , laryngeal symptom acute attack HAE . The PK safety/tolerability SC icatibant evaluate least 10 additional pubertal/postpubertal subject meet screen criterion receive treatment SC icatibant absence current acute HAE attack . The planned duration active participation subject present initial attack acute HAE consist treatment single subcutaneous injection icatibant Day 1 follow day 90 . After received initial treatment icatibant , either absence attack , least 10 pubertal/postpubertal subject subsequently experience acute HAE attack may continue receive treatment icatibant single SC administration per attack total 3 eligible icatibant-treated attack . The period active participation study prepubertal subject approximately 90 day , pubertal/postpubertal subject could maximum approximately 270 360 day ( 3 separate active period approximately 90 day treat icatibant attack ; 4 separate active period treat without attack ) , active period separate period inactive participation variable duration .</detailed_description>
