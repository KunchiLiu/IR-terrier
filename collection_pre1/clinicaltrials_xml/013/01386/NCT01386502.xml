	<brief_summary>Background : - The p53 gene normally help stop cancer cell grow . However , p53 gene mutate damage , cancer cell may grow unchecked . Researchers work vaccine help immune system recognize destroy cell p53 mutation may cancerous . - CT-011 another drug may help body 's immune system fight cancer . This drug block chemical find tumor cell prevent immune system recognize destroy . Research study show CT-011 slows growth tumor . By combine p53 vaccine CT-011 , researcher hope slow stop tumor growth people whose cancer respond standard treatment . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness CT-011 p53 genetic vaccine treat adult solid tumor respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age solid tumor respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They also blood test tumor image study . - Participants receive p53 vaccine injection arm thigh . - Two day receive p53 vaccine , study receive CT-011 infusion 2 hour . Participants monitor infusion side effect . - The combination p53 vaccine CT-011 repeat every 3 week ( one cycle ) . Treatment continue long side effect severe tumor grow . - Three week second dose p53 vaccine CT-011 , participant full physical exam . They also blood test , tumor image study . This exam set repeat every two cycle p53 vaccine CT-011 . - Participants regular follow-up visit year stop treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - PD1 inhibitory receptor belong CD28-B7 family . - PD1 bind two ligand PD-L1 PD-L2 modulate T-cell immune response . - PD1 express T cell , B cell , NK cell . - The expression PD-1 ligand ( PD-L1 ) tumor associate immune suppression poor prognosis . Objectives : - To determine safety tolerability escalate dos anti PD1 antibody ( CT-011 ) combination subcutaneous p53 vaccine . - To determine immune response wt p53 ( 264-272 ) peptide . - To determine clinical efficacy combination . Eligibility : - 18 year age old , pregnant nursing immunocompromised autoimmune disease . - HLA-A2 haplotype . - ECOG performance status 0-1 . - Advanced solid tumor express p53 protein histological confirmation original primary tumor via Pathology Laboratory , CCR , NCI . Design : - Single arm , pilot/phase I trial patient receive fix dose vaccine combination escalate dose CT-011 . - The vaccine administer subcutaneously every 3 week follow CT-011 two day vaccine disease progression toxicity . - Patients undergo blood draw aphaeresis immunologic assay prior starting treatment every second cycle . - Patients assess overall safety , immunologic efficacy , tumor response use RECIST criterion survival . - Patients follow two year last vaccination assessment safety efficacy .</detailed_description>
