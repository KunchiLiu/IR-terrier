	<detailed_description>This pilot study affect HED male unaffected male control , age 1 year , use minimally invasive device image sweat ducts intact skin , measure stimulate sweat rate , subset subject collect clip scalp hair sample RNA analysis . This study descriptive nature intend assess ability use innovative approach generate data subject wide age spectrum , particular emphasis phenotype variability male sibling ( mutation ) . To end , priority give family contain multiple affected sibling ( i.e . two brother ) . Summary data generate various group test , power calculation involve .</detailed_description>
