	<brief_summary>This study look permeability , 'leakiness ' airway epithelium ( inner line lung ) asthmatic patient . Increased leakiness line show asthmatic patient study , lung also possibly gut , perhaps reflect widespread defect . This leakiness may underline interaction environment person 's genetic make , may contribute people get asthma , severe . Increased leakiness may allow increased exposure inhale allergic substance , help perpetuate inflammation lung hallmark asthma . Specifically , study attempt modify reduce permeability use substance call 'keratinocyte growth factor ' , 'kgf ' . KGF naturally occur human protein , involve stimulating growth cell line layer skin gut , help repair damage maintain structure . It manufacture laboratory commercial compound 'Palifermin ' , already use human reduce damage line mouth chemotherapy . The study see Palifermin similarly improve line lung asthma patient improve symptom . To date treatment use area asthma , successful study open whole new area therapy</brief_summary>
