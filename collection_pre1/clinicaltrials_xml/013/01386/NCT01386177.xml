	<brief_summary>The purpose study determinate effect pre-treatment doxazosin , alpha1-adrenergic receptor blocker , pharmacodynamics pharmacokinetics 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` ecstasy '' ) . The investigator hypothesize doxazosin attenuate cardiovascular subjective response MDMA .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacological Interaction Between Doxazosin Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , `` ecstasy '' ) widely use young people euphoric effect . MDMA release serotonin ( 5-HT ) , dopamine , norepinephrine ( NE ) . NE release think mediate cardiovascular effect MDMA may also contribute psychostimulant effect . However , functional role adrenergic postsynaptic receptor cardiovascular subjective effect MDMA human largely unclear . To determine role alpha-adrenergic receptor response MDMA humans investigator test effect alpha1-receptor blocker doxazosin physiological subjective effect MDMA . The investigator use randomize double-blind placebo-controlled cross-over design four experimental session . doxazosin placebo administer MDMA placebo 16 healthy volunteer . Subjective cardiovascular response repeatedly assess throughout experiment plasma sample collect pharmacokinetics . The primary hypothesis doxazosin significantly reduce blood pressure response MDMA .</detailed_description>
