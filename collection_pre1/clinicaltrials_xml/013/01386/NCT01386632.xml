	<brief_summary>This randomize mask placebo-controlled single-center study evaluate effect Dichloroacetate ( DCA ) versus placebo give combination Cisplatin radiation treatment patient Stage III-IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck ( SCCHN ) . Fifty subject enrol randomly assign 1:1 ratio DCA match placebo give standard care treatment consist Cisplatin radiation treatment . Patients receive DCA/placebo PO per G-tube twice day 8 week . The first 6 patient total study population represent safety lead-in cohort . The result safety lead-in DCA/placebo combination Cisplatin radiation therapy evaluate 6th patient complete 8 week therapy . Recruitment patient withhold safety data analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Doses Cisplatin base actual body weight take day Cisplatin therapy . DCA dose calculate baseline accord actual body weight change 8 week therapy . A careful description extent primary lesion nodal spread record . Dental Evaluation : Prior treatment , patient evaluate dental service prophylactic cleaning/fluoride regimen institute . A delay least 14 day major surgery , include dental extraction , require prior Day 1 treatment . Airway Patency : Significant laryngeal edema describe use cisplatin containing regimen . Patients laryngeal tumor consider prophylactic tracheostomy prior initiation chemotherapy , possibility airway compromise exists . Patients laryngeal tumor experience respiratory stridor compromise shortly chemotherapy/radiotherapy administration rapidly evaluate tracheostomy . Alimentation : Significant stomatitis , mucositis dysphagia expect treatment regimen . Hospitalization may require symptomatic management . Pronounced weight loss common , adequate alimentation need maintain . Early , pre-emptive , enteral tube feeding consider difficulty anticipate . Compliance : The complexity treatment regimes attendant toxicity compliance major concern . Patients expect pose compliance problem enter study . Patients need see least weekly therapy toxicity monitor treat .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically , cytologically confirm previously untreated stage 3 4 HNSC recommend treatment would concurrent cisplatin radiation . Age ≥ 18 year ECOG performance status ≤ 2 Karnofsky ≥70 % Life expectancy great 12 week . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL Hemoglobin ≥90 g/L Platelets ≥100,000/mcL Total bilirubin ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 X ULN ≤ 5 X ULN presence liver metastases Creatinine ≤1.5 X institutional upper limit normal The effect DCA develop human fetus unknown . For reason DCA teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( e.g . : hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand purpose study willingness sign write informed consent document . Repeat biopsy mandatory , strongly suggest . Should perform Day 8 Day 15 treatment . Patients may receive investigational agent , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , molecular target agent . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction could confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition DCA . ( Cetuximab ) Due possibility peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy DCA , presence grade 2 high peripheral neuropathy due prior medical condition ( multiple sclerosis ) , medication , etiology . Any psychological , familial , sociological , geographical condition permit medical followup compliance study protocol . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , diabetes mellitus , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Specifically , patient take either oral hypoglycemics insulin diabetes mellitus eligible DCA combination agent may increase risk clinically significant hypoglycemia , compromise patient safety . Pregnant breastfeed woman exclude study DCA agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother DCA , breastfeed discontinue mother treated DCA . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction DCA . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Five year must elapse since initial curative procedure malignancy , except situ cervical cancer , basal cell carcinoma skin , localized prostate cancer curative therapy surgery , radiation . History malabsorption syndrome substantial amount small bowel stomach remove may impair absorption DCA .</criteria>
