	<brief_title>A Study TransPyloric Shuttle™ ( TPS™ ) Weight Reduction Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number people overweight obese steadily rise . In Australia , 1980 , 8.3 % population consider obese . By 2010 , Australian obesity rate rise 24.8 % . Weight loss significantly decrease early mortality well development new health-related condition obese subject , improve many co-morbidities associated obesity . Therapies include drug , surgery treatment medical device , gastric band intragastric balloon . The TransPyloric Shuttle™ ( TPS™ ) medical device endoscopically deliver remove stomach . The TPS™ design self-position across pylorus create intermittent obstruction outflow may result delay gastric emptying . Slowing gastric emptying may enable overall reduction caloric intake help subject feel full sooner ( early satiation ) and/or feel full longer ( prolonged satiety/reduced hunger ) .</detailed_description>
