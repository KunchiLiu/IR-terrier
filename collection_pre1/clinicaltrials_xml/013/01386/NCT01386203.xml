The investigator also analyze headspace NSCLC SCLC cell line investigator could discriminate significantly SCLC versus NSCLC base VOCs pattern . This analysis allow u identify specific VOCs consume omit cancerous cell . Therefore , non-invasive highly sensitive test would extremely valuable classification early screen lung cancer target therapy . In study , investigator monitor VOC pattern patient lung cancer well high risk cohort patient risk/evaluation lung cancer . Likewise investigator monitor pts therapy .

	<detailed_description>Scientific background : Lung cancer lethal cancer , responsible 28 % cancer death kill ~1.3 million people worldwide every year . Diagnosis treatment lung cancer early stage could increase 5-year-survival rate 3-4 fold potential cure4 , 7 . Therefore , main goal study early detection lung cancer , specifically focus volatile biomarkers lung cancer assist easy , inexpensive diagnosis base previous finding . Currently available diagnostic test lung cancer suitable screening , extremely costly involve invasive procedure ( e.g . bronchoscopy ) , free complication . The goal cancer screen detect tumor early stage order give treatment good chance success . Recently , big lung cancer screen trial ( NLST ) show mortality benefit 21 % per 5 year study favor low dose CT screen protocol compare chest X-rays1 . Therefore , urgent requirement tool allow good definition high-risk cohort . Such tool might panel biomarkers . Focusing volatile biomarkers lung cancer , group recently define volatile VOCs signature distinguish breath lung cancer patient breath healthy individual cancerous cell 2 , 9 . These significant finding lead u understand volatile biomarkers would fit early detection lung cancer discrimination subtypes lung cancer . Such discrimination significant implication clinical decision patient ' benefit . Exhaled Breath Analysis Diagnostic Tool Preliminary result : Analysis volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) new attractive non-invasive field medical diagnostics . The principle behind approach base fact cancer cell distinguish normal cell metabolism rate , cell apoptosis pathways protein expression pattern thus emit consume various VOCs . These VOCs detect either directly headspace cancer cell via exhaled breath . Together Prof Haick group Technion Inst ( Israel ) , data show relation VOCs pattern NSCLC control cell line equivalent state exhale breath . We demonstrate clear discrimination lung cancer healthy cluster . We also analyze headspace NSCLC SCLC cell line could discriminate significantly SCLC versus NSCLC base VOCs pattern . This analysis allow u identify specific VOCs consume omit cancerous cell . This find clinical application since SCLC distinguish NSCLC sensitivity chemotherapy radiotherapy characteristic . Therefore , non-invasive highly sensitive test would extremely valuable classification early screen lung cancer target therapy . Breath Collection Artificial NOSE In typical collection , normal exhalation , subject breath mouthpiece filter air remove VOCs ambient contaminant . Individuals exhale constant flow rate . The exhaled air contain mouthpiece Mayler bag and/or pass container . The collected air breath sample analyse VOC gas-chromatography mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) , highly-sensitive nano-sensors ( Nanomaterial-Based Devices , Technion - Israel Institute Technology , Haifa , Israel ) online mass spectrometry ( Ionimed , Austria ) . Further , signal analyze pattern recognition algorithm , principal component analysis ( PCA ) , support vector machine ( SVM ) , neuronal network analysis apply entire set signal acquire information identity , property chemical composition vapor expose sensor array 5 , 10 . Research Objectives : Our goal isolate define volatile signature , allow discrimination lung cancer normal state . That potential serve unique biomarker lung cancer . Our Objectives : - To test feasibility detect early stage lung cancer via analysis exhale breath irrespective sub-histology . - To test feasibility breath biomarkers monitor response lung cancer treatment ( surgery , chemotherapy cancer treatment ) - To compare sensitivity selectivity breath analysis conventional cancer marker and/or diagnostics ( CT , PET , circulate tumor cell , blood marker etc . ) - Correlation histology and/or clinical measure breath signature . Study Population On clinical setup , sample three population : Group A - patient lung cancer ( NSCLC SCLC ) , stage ; group divide later : 1 . SCLC ( therapy ) . 2 . NSCLC : 1 . Surgically treat ( Before therapy 3 year follow ) . 2 . Advanced disease ( Before therapy , 3 year follow ) . Group B - high risk patient undergo investigation relate Lung cancer pulmonary nodule . Group C - age co-morbidity match control without proof cancer/pre-cancer . All collection follow local IRB guideline . Information collect subject , include epidemiologic data , histologic characteristic , tumor 's metabolic activity ( SUV avidity PET scan ) . The clinical information include health status , lung cancer subtype , pathology sub-classification differentiation , advanced analysis stain available , image result ( include CT , PET scan SUV avidity ) , location cancer , total volume tumor , stage disease , genetic classification tumor epidemiological data , e.g . age , gender , smoke family history , family history , respiratory disease , exposure asbestos etc . If cancer , selection therapy per standard care routine establish care provide staff local institute . This protocol intend interfere dictate process . Examination procedure The total duration study subject take 10-20 minute subject stay followup 3 year . The study continue 5 year . Newly diagnose patient non small cell lung cancer : Breath test : 1 . Two test immediately prior therapy ( surgery/other ; One week apart test reproducibility ) . 2 . If operated cure , 3,6,12,18,24,36 month later . 3 . If radiate , mid &amp; end radiation 3,6,12,18,24,36 month . 4 . If chemotherapy , every 3 month , cycle . Follow phase : Every three month coincide patient regular follow treat physician . As per standard care , point every patient monitor CT scan chest abdomen regular interval . This CT use determination disease recurrence document remission . Correlative study 1 . Sputum Cytology ( Induced Sputum collect cytologic examination ) . 2 . Blood sample take Circulating tumor cell analysis systemic marker . Collection Breath Samples In typical collection , normal exhalation , subject breath mouthpiece filter air remove VOCs ambient contaminant . Individuals exhale constant flow rate . The exhaled air contain mouthpiece Mayler bag and/or pass container . The collected air breath sample analyse VOC gas-chromatography mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) , highly-sensitive nano-sensors ( Nanomaterial-Based Devices , Technion - Israel Institute Technology , Haifa , Israel ) online mass spectrometry ( Ionimed , Austria ) .
