	<brief_summary>This phase I/II partially randomize trial study side effect best dose veliparib give together radiation therapy , carboplatin , paclitaxel see well work treat patient stage III non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery . Veliparib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether radiation therapy , carboplatin , paclitaxel effective without veliparib treat non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Veliparib With Without Radiation Therapy , Carboplatin , Paclitaxel Patients With Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ABT-888 ( veliparib ) give concurrently standard carboplatin/paclitaxel radiotherapy patient unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . ( Phase I ) II . To assess whether carboplatin/paclitaxel plus ABT-888 compare carboplatin/paclitaxel plus placebo improves progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient unresectable stage III NSCLC . ( Phase II ) III . To compare overall survival ( OS ) patient treat carboplatin/paclitaxel radiotherapy plus ABT-888 treat carboplatin , paclitaxel radiotherapy plus placebo . ( Phase II ) IV . To assess response rate ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) disease control rate subset patient measurable disease Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . ( Phase II ) V. To assess safety toxicity profile regimen . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To collect tumor tissue pretreatment biopsy ( archival sample ) biomarker study , include poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase 1 ( PARP ) activity measure level poly-ADP-ribose , gamma-H2A histone family , member X ( gamma-H2AX ) , messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression level deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair enzymes excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency , complementation group 1 ( ERCC1 ) /x-ray repair complement defective repair Chinese hamster cell 1 ( XRCC1 ) . II . To collect blood sample evaluation gamma-H2AX ( circulate tumor cell ) relevant future study . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study veliparib follow randomized phase II study . PHASE I : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3D-CRT ) daily ( QD ) , 5 day week , 6 week . Patients also receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-43 carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute paclitaxel IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 36 , 43 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients without disease progression completion chemoradiotherapy undergo consolidation therapy . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Beginning within 4-6 week chemotherapy radiation therapy , patient receive veliparib PO BID day 1-7 ( course 1 ) 22-28 ( course 2 ) carboplatin IV 30 minute paclitaxel IV 3 hour day 1 day 22 course 2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients undergo 3D-CRT receive veliparib , carboplatin , paclitaxel Phase I induction consolidation therapy . ARM II : Patients undergo 3D-CRT arm I . Patients also receive placebo PO BID day 1-43 carboplatin paclitaxel Phase I . Within 4-6 week completion chemotherapy radiation therapy , patient receive placebo day 1-7 carboplatin paclitaxel Phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month first 2 year every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
