	<brief_summary>In order tumour grow spread part body , need blood supply . Certain proteins body , call cytokine growth factor , show cause growth new blood vessel supply tumour therefore help tumour grow spread . Motesanib ( AMG 706 ) prevents proteins work , may help prevent growth tumour . In first part study , look way body absorbs drug blood , body change break drug , drug leaf body urine faeces . In order provide potential treatment benefit subject participate first part study , second part study allow subject continue motesanib ( AMG 706 ) treatment . The estimated length part study unknown , dependent subject respond motesanib ( AMG 706 ) .</brief_summary>
