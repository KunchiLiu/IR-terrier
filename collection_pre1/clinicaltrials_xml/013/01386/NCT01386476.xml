	<brief_summary>Background : - The blood-brain barrier help protect brain infection toxins blood stream . But also prevent certain drug reach brain treat disease problem . Researchers interested chemical help show barrier work . One possible chemical , ( 18F ) FCWAY , may useful study barrier . More test need determine effective . Objectives : - To test whether ( 18F ) FCWAY use help study blood-brain barrier . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 50 year age . Design : - This study require screen visit two scan visit . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also blood urine test . - At first scan visit , participant magnetic resonance image scan provide baseline image brain . - Before second visit , participant stay overnight hospital . They receive drug tariquidar , may help ( 18F ) FCWAY show blood-brain barrier clearly . - At second scan visit , participant positron emission tomography scan ( 18F ) FCWAY see well drug show blood-brain barrier scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : We use radioligand [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop ( N-desmethyl-loperamide ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) study measure function P-gp , efflux transporter blood-brain barrier . Because [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop avid substrate P-gp , see almost radioactivity brain baseline healthy volunteer . However , see increased radioactivity brain patient dementia , co-administer medication block function P-gp . While [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop useful detect increased radioactivity brain , disadvantage [ ( 11 ) C ] dLop useful detect decreased radioactivity brain . The reason floor effect , unable detect less radioactivity zero . Preclinical study indicate increase P-gp activity ( would manifest decreased radioactivity brain ) correlate drug-resistant epilepsy HIV . To good understand disease associate increase also decrease P-gp activity , wish identify radioligand moderate substrate P-gp . We suspect [ ( 18 ) F ] FCWAY moderate substrate P-gp , radioligand get brain baseline , get brain administer drug ( disulfiram ) inhibit P-gp . The objective study determine whether serotonin 1A antagonist [ ( 18 ) F ] FCWAY substrate P-gp determine whether P-gp inhibitor , tariquidar , increase uptake radioligand brain . Study Population : We study 45 healthy adult , age 18-50 . Participants must free medication , exception birth control pill , medication may confound data . iii patient receive single PET scan state ) , invite back option receive second PET scan tariquidar . A maximum 15 ubjects receive scan . Design : Healthy adult undergo either 1 ) single PET scan brain [ ( 18 ) F ] FCWAY ( baseline , infusion intravenous tariquidar 2 ) two PET scan ( baseline tariquidar scan ) . Outcome Measures : If [ ( 18 ) F ] FCWAY substrate P-gp , pre-treatment tariquidar increase brain uptake [ ( 18 ) F ] FCWAY delay time peak uptake .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must 18 50 year old . Subjects must currently healthy , base history , physical exam , laboratory test . With exception birth control pill , subject must agree take medication , prescription overthecounter , one week one week receive tariquidar . Subjects must able willing give write informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects routinely take prescription medication , except birth control pill . That , subject discontinue mediation merely participate study . Subjects take recreational overthecounter drug . Subjects exclude current Axis I diagnosis , include current diagnosis alcohol substance abuse . History psychotic symptom suicide attempt . Head trauma result period unconsciousness lasting longer 10 minute history seizure , seizure may increase function Pgp . Recent exposure radiation ( i.e. , PET research ) combine study would allowable limit . Pregnancy breast feed . Positive urine drug screen . Unlikely tolerate small , enclosed space , MRI . Metallic foreign body would affect MRI magnet fear enclose space likely make subject unable complete MRI scan . Positive HIV status . Inability lie flat camera bed 2 ( Omega ) hour .</criteria>
