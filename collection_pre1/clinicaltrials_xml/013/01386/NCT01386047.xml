	<detailed_description>Clinical prediction rule ( CPRs ) frontline decision aid help physician make evidence-based , cost-effective decision benefit patient . CPRs proven tool translate evidence practice , increase quality reduce cost , use physician wide variety clinical setting , primary care office , emergency room , hospital . While many CPRs develop validated year , health care provider yet incorporate everyday care . CPRs aid provider assess impact individual component patient 's history , physical examination , basic lab result estimate probability disease potential response treatment . Prediction rule use data readily available time patient encounter often reduce unnecessary treatment diagnostic test . CPRs differ reminder system alert CPRs pull aspect history physical exam evidence base fashion estimate probability , prognosis , make treatment recommendation . The goal study utilize patient electronic health record incorporate CPRs face-to-face patient encounter . We propose select certain clinical situation well-validated CPRs available likely need frequent basis . We randomly assign integrated CPR versus usual care point care evaluate impact integration doctor behavior evidence-based decision making . Mount Sinai 's Division General Internal Medicine ( DGIM ) significant experience aspect CPRs , include derivation , validation , implementation , systematic review . Furthermore , Division develop interactive web library CPRs clinical use one widely sit kind . We propose collaborate Epic , one nation 's large respect electronic medical record ( EMR ) company , integrate validate CPRs EMRs assess impact provider behavior patient care .</detailed_description>
