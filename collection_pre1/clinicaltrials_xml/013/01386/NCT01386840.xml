	<detailed_description>Primary objective trial ass rate treatment failure ( define ) within first 7 day efficacy 7 day course oral amoxycillin administer home comparison administration oral amoxycillin first 48 hour hospital . Treatment failure define follows- - Clinical deterioration disease time enrollment : develop sign severe disease persistent vomiting ( vomit repeat thrice within hour due reason ) , central cyanosis , grunt , stridor , abnormally sleepy difficult wake , inability drink , convulsion , death . - Change antibiotic : due persistent vomiting ( vomit amoxycillin within 20 minute administration ; 3 attempt ) , , develop co-morbid condition , persist fever &gt; 98.6Â°F low chest indrawing even 3rd day , , fever alone day 5 , , low chest indrawing alone ( non responsive three dos nebulization bronchodilator ) day 5 ( report mother ) , , persistence fast breathing day 7 non responsive three dos nebulisation bronchodilator . - Hospitalization : time home manage patient clinical decision extend hospitalization longer 48 hour hospitalized child re-hospitalization discharge 48 hour hospital . It could relate pneumonia , therapy amoxycillin [ relatedness determine Data &amp; Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) ] . - Children need restart antibiotic i.e . `` failure treatment '' , day 8th day 14th due reappearance danger sign , low chest indrawing fast breathe non responsive three trial nebulization bronchodilator . - Serious adverse event consider possibly probably related amoxycillin . - Left medical advice ( LAMA ) Voluntary withdrawal consent study enrollment uptill day 14th . - Loss follow uptill day 14th . Secondary objective trial determine child receive oral amoxycillin severe pneumonia , follow : - Determine proportion child need restart antibiotic i.e . `` failure treatment '' , day 8th day 14th due reappearance danger sign , low chest indrawing fast breathe non responsive three trial nebulization bronchodilator . - To identify clinical predictor baseline course treatment predict `` failure oral treatment '' , enrollment till day 14th . - The cost home hospital management severe pneumonia oral amoxycillin . - Left medical advice ( LAMA ) Voluntary withdrawal consent day 7th day 14th . - Loss follow day 8th day 14th .</detailed_description>
