	<brief_summary>Blood sample health information ( e.g. , age diagnosis , test result ) collect purpose genetic research . The blood sample assign number store repository safe keep need research project . Participants person healthy ( high blood pressure , diabetes , high cholesterol level ) person Diabetes Mellitus Type II ( T2D ) live Indiana . Participants complete questionnaire time blood sample drawn . Visits repeat 2 5 year initial contact . Researchers apply Fairbanks Institute use blood sample health information minus participant name contact information . Their research require related find gene substance make gene may involve Diabetes Mellitus Type II purpose improve investigator understand illness potentially lead development new diagnostic tool identify illness , new treatment , preventative measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Aim : The purpose study create extensively annotate bio-repository platform hypothesis-driven research lead advancement diagnosis , treatment prevention diseases common population Indiana . The second phase research platform create collect blood sample two group individual Central Indiana community , one document evidence Diabetes Mellitus Type II ( T2D ) , second group age , gender ethnicity match individual without clinical evidence Diabetes . Each individual 's blood sample link clinical , demographic epidemiological information , gather retrospectively prospectively . Recruitment : This study include 500 individual T2D ( T2D Group ) 500 individual age , gender , ethnicity match T2D Group , without presentation clinical evidence T2D ( Control Group ) . To reflect grow representation Hispanics Central Indiana , Hispanics overly recruit group study population accurately reflect general population Central Indiana . Follow-up : As prospective , longitudinal study , follow-up study subject intend include two follow visit continue indefinitely , unless , course , time , consent follow-up withdrawn subject . Follow-up include visit 2 5 year post initial contact continue access subject 's medical record pursue data concern change subject 's health . Subjects may contact telephone , mail email every twelve month ask wish continue participation study . The 2 5 year follow visit mirror initial visit . The collected dataset ( make collect blood sample link clinical epidemiological information collect retrospectively prospectively ) , use medical research find gene , gene product RNA proteins help understanding cause disease guide development new treatment</detailed_description>
