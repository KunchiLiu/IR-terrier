	<brief_summary>Genes `` blueprint '' body . Some people bear abnormal copy ( `` mutation '' ) gene . These people may higher chance get disease . Different mutation different gene cause different disease . Some woman get breast cancer bear abnormal copy gene call BRCA1 BRCA2 . These woman also high chance get ovary cancer . Women breast cancer abnormal copy BRCA1 BRCA2 also high chance get second breast cancer breast . Because , woman might mutation may genetic test soon breast cancer diagnosis learn risk get another cancer . Genetic testing may do right woman diagnose breast cancer . It may also do later , surgery do treat cancer . The investigator know best genetic testing . The investigator study try understand whether woman prefer test surgery . The investigator also want find feel choice later , diagnosis past .</brief_summary>
