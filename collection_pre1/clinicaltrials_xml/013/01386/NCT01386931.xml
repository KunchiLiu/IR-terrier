	<brief_summary>This study multicenter prospective randomize controlled trial . Potential participant study include patient refer Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) solid pancreatic lesion one participating center . If patient meet inclusion criterion sign inform consent , randomize one two study arm 1:1 ratio . Patients either undergo EUS-FNA without on-site cytopathologist present EUS-FNA . Patients assign on-site cytopathologist arm cytopathologist dictate number fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) pass perform endosonographer . This number base adequacy specimen ability provide preliminary diagnosis . In arm , absence on-site cytopathologist , endosonographer perform predetermine number 7 pass ( standard care absence on-site cytopathologist ) . The technique perform EUS-FNA ( needle type , use stylet , suction ) standardize among endosonographers order rule confound factor . After EUS-FNA perform slide send pathology department . The slides sent review regardless arm patient randomize , review experienced cytopathologists purpose determine final diagnosis . Future clinical intervention monitor purpose report impact EUS-FNA patient 's clinical course determine diagnostic accuracy . Patients follow prospectively least one year , gold-standard final diagnosis pancreatic malignancy define presence malignant cytology histologic evidence ( patient undergoes surgery ) clinical and/or image follow-up consistent pancreatic cancer ( death clinical progression ) . A detailed account medical equipment use procedure , procedure time , clinic visits/hospitalizations due procedure related complication , number repeat procedure record systematically . The investigator hypothesize on-site cytopathologist EUS-FNA pancreatic mass improve diagnostic yield , accuracy , lower duration , complication need repeat procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) play integral role diagnosis suspect pancreatic cancer , EUS find crucial determine course future management potential treatment option patient . EUS sensitive imaging modality detection pancreatic mass , sensitivity great equal 90 % . Furthermore , EUS-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) play important role accurate stag pancreatic cancer sensitivity 85 % specificity close 100 % . EUS-FNA consider cost-effective virtue impact therapeutic management . In particular , real-time tissue sample EUS-FNA possible cytopathologist ( pathologist skilled evaluate fine needle aspiration specimen ) able present time FNA order review biopsy slide make preliminary diagnosis . The availability on-site cytopathologist potential provide quick diagnostic predictive information confirm presence stag suspected malignancy . The rationale on-site cytopathologist include increase adequacy yield biopsy tissue/aspirate decrease need additional pass obtain diagnostic yield tissue . This hypothesis , however , formally examine . In proposed randomized control multicenter trial , hypothesize on-site cytopathologist EUS-FNA pancreatic mass improve diagnostic yield , accuracy , lower duration , complication need repeat procedure . This hypothesis explore context follow specific aim . Specific aim # 1 : To compare diagnostic yield malignancy proportion inadequate specimen two group . Specific aim # 2 : To compare sensitivity , specificity accuracy EUS-FNA two group use histologic diagnosis cytologic diagnosis conjunction clinical and/or image follow-up gold standard . Specific aim # 3 : To compare duration , rate complication repeat procedure two group .</detailed_description>
