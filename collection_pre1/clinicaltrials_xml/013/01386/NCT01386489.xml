	<brief_summary>Background : The primary focus Vaccine Research Center ( VRC ) NIH develop vaccine HIV/AIDS . The main purpose study look detail body immune response two experimental HIV vaccine currently development VRC . One know rAd5 vaccine know DNA vaccine . These vaccine make piece manufacture DNA . They contain live kill HIV . It impossible study vaccine give HIV cause give HIV someone else . Both experimental vaccine give people research study . They approve treat prevent HIV infection . Purpose : The main purpose study look detail body immune response experimental HIV vaccine give assess safety study vaccine . Eligibility : Healthy volunteer age 18 50 infected HIV meet eligibility requirement . Design : Participants screen medical history ( include question sexual history drug use ) , physical exam , blood test . The study two group : &lt; TAB &gt; One group receive one injection rAd5 vaccine , 8 clinic visit 3 month . &lt; TAB &gt; The second group three injection DNA vaccine , one injection rAd5 vaccine , 12 clinic visit 6 month . All participant ask provide blood body fluid sample test study . Payment participation provide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This hypothesis-generating descriptive study evaluate kinetics pattern early innate adaptive immune response VRC recombinant adenoviral vector serotype 5 vaccine , VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP ( rAd5 ) . The rAd5 vaccine previously administer 1000 study subject characterize safe immunogenic . A difference pattern vaccine antigen-specific immune response observe rAd5 give single agent compare prim 6-plasmid DNA vaccine , VRCHIVDNA016-00-VP , previously report . This study randomize vaccine-naive subject receive single injection rAd5 DNA primerAd5 boost regimen large Phase II study . Collection blood , rectal , oral genital specimen characterization early innate adaptive immune response follow receipt rAd5 . The hypothesis pattern early innate adaptive immune response elicit rAd5 vaccine administer prim DNA vaccine distinctly different pattern elicit rAd5 administer single agent . The primary objective describe kinetics pattern early innate adaptive immune response occur blood sample early administration rAd5 vaccine alone administration follow 3 DNA prime injection . Secondary exploratory objective related safety , well pattern immune response mucosal sample blood sample . Product Description : VRC-HIVDNA016-00-VP [ 6-plasmid DNA vaccine ] compose 6 close , circular DNA plasmid encode HIV-1 Gag , Pol Nef protein ( clade B ) Env glycoproteins clade A , clade B , clade C , combine equal proportion . All injection 4 mg dose 1 mL volume administer intramuscularly ( IM ) Biojector ( register trademark ) deltoid muscle . VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP ( rAd5 vaccine ) compose 4 recombinant nonreplicating adenoviral vector encode HIV-1 Gag/Pol polyproteins ( clade B ) Env glycoproteins clade A , clade B , clade C , combine 3:1:1:1 ratio , respectively , final formulation buffer ( FFB ) . All injection 10 ( 10 ) PU dose 1 mL volume administer IM needle syringe deltoid muscle . Subjects : The study target accrual least 20 subject complete collection blood , oral , rectal genital specimens 2 week rAd5 vaccination . To account potential discontinuation study , enrollment may include 36 HIV-uninfected adult , age 18-50 year old HIV vaccine-naive adenovirus serotype 5 ( Ad5 ) antibody negative screening ; male must fully circumcise . Study Plan : Subjects randomize 1:1 ratio receive single injection rAd5 DNA prime-rAd5 boost schedule stratify gender achieve approximately equal distribution gender two vaccination schedule . Subjects randomize Group 1 may receive vaccination enrollment day schedule day vaccination occur within 6 week follow expected 24 hour inpatient unit day 3 post-vaccination sample collection frequent sample immediately ensue accord sample collection schedule . Subjects randomize Group 2 receive first three DNA vaccination schedule project date subsequent injection timepoints intensive sample collection schedule . Due need commit 3 day disruption normal daily activity , start day rAd5 vaccination either schedule , flexibility schedule rAd5 vaccination include protocol plan . Subjects group admit NIH Clinical Center overnight first 24 hour follow vaccination rAd5 . On rAd5 vaccination day , peripheral blood sample collect serum , plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell seven target time point first 24 hour follow : pre-injection post-injection hour 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 ; day 3 , 5 , 7 , 14 28 post-rAd5 vaccine . Mucosal sample occur day 14 rAd5 vaccine . This include buccal mucosa , rectal secretion , cervical secretion ( woman ) semen sample ( men ) . There blood collection ass innate immunity follow 3rd DNA vaccination Group 2 blood draws pre-injection post-injection hour 1 , 3 , 6 18 . The safety vaccination research plan monitor protocol safety review team . Study Duration : Subjects follow clinic 12 week last study injection contact long term follow-up 12 week later every 48 week Study Week 144 .</detailed_description>
