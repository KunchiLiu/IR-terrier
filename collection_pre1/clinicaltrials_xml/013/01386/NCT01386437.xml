	<brief_summary>Background : - The immune system make special cell , tissue , organ fight infection . Problems system may lead frequent , severe , unusual fungal infection . These infection often difficult treat . Researchers want collect blood tissue sample people unusual , persistent severe fungal infection immune problem increase risk infection . Objectives : - To collect medical information sample long-term study people immune system problem lead fungal infection . Eligibility : - People history fungal infection cause immune system problem . - Parents , child , sibling group . - Healthy volunteer relate first two group . Design : - This long-term study may last 10 year . Those study may need provide new information every 6 month . The procedure person may vary particular diagnosis extent fungal infection . Healthy volunteer may one two visit . - At first visit , study full medical history physical exam . They also provide blood . - Research procedure may include follow : - Saliva , urine stool test - Mouthwash collection DNA test - Collection cheek cell , nail clipping , vaginal fluid - Tests leftover tissue body fluid previous medical procedure - Skin oral mucous membrane biopsy - Collection white blood cell - Followup visit involve physical exam update medical history . Blood , saliva , urine , nail clipping sample may take ongoing study . Any additional test exams require study doctor may also do . - Participants may withdraw study pool time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Individuals With Immune System Problems That Lead Fungal Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol natural history study design investigate clinical , microbiologic , genetic immunologic correlate primary immune deficiency condition associate mucocutaneous invasive fungal infection ( IFIs ) . The hypothesis chronic mucocutaneous mycoses IFIs cause abnormality immune function patient identify use modern method molecular cell biology immunology . For inclusion , patient must history active mucocutaneous invasive fungal infection , may may define primary acquire immunodeficiency state . Patients undergo evaluation include history/physical examination blood , saliva , possible tissue sample genetic immunological testing . Patient relative may also screen clinical , microbiological , genetic and/or immunological correlate host defense abnormality . Healthy volunteer enrol source control blood , saliva , possible tissue sampling , genetic testing . The aim protocol use modern method molecular cell biology immunology elucidate immunopathogenesis fungal disease human . A good understanding primary immunodeficiency identification fungal host risk factor fungal infection may provide new insight pathogenesis identify target development novel therapy . Enrolled subject may follow 10 year undergo additional clinical evaluation sample . Follow-up may occur every 6 month frequently depend clinical course , underlie risk factor ( ) , type fungal infection . Under circumstance , standard medical treatment provide fungal infection immune deficiency .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients : Patients without inherit acquire abnormality immune function manifest mucocutaneous and/or invasive fungal infection eligible screen assessment protocol . Specifically , patient must meet follow inclusion criterion order participate study : Adults child ( regardless age , gender ethnicity/race ) know yet uncharacterized inherited immunodeficiency definitively diagnose mucocutaneous invasive fungal infection . OR Adults child ( regardless age , gender ethnicity/race ) acquire immunodeficiency severe , unusual , persistent treatmentrefractory chronic mucocutaneous fungal infection . OR Adults child ( regardless age , gender ethnicity/race ) acquire immunodeficiency possible , probable proven invasive fungal infection ( European Organization Research Treatment Cancer / Mycoses Study Group criterion ) . OR Adults child ( regardless age , gender ethnicity/race ) welldocumented prior , unusual , severe , persistent , treatmentrefractory mucocutaneous invasive fungal infection ( ) , clinically recovered fungal infection . OR Adults child ( regardless age , gender ethnicity/race ) autoimmune polyendocrinopathycandidiasisectodermal dystrophy ( APECED ) yet develop CMC . Ongoing care referring/primary care physician ( inside outside NIH ) . Willing allow storage blood tissue sample future analysis . Willing allow genetic testing blood , body fluid tissue specimen . Willing HIV test For Clinical Center inpatients unable give inform consent due illness cognitive incapacity , Durable Power Attorney ( DPA ) must available provide informed consent . Patient Relatives : Individuals ( regardless age , gender ethnicity/race ) genetically relate patient ( e.g. , mother , father , sibling , child ) may recruit establish genetic origin immune defect may identify study patient discretion PI . Relatives must meet follow inclusion criterion order participate study : Willing allow storage blood tissue sample future analysis . Willing allow genetic testing blood , body fluid tissue specimen . Willing HIV test Healthy Volunteers : Healthy adult regardless gender ethnicity/race age 18 85 year old may eligible participate study . Healthy volunteer must meet follow inclusion criterion order participate study : Willing allow storage blood tissue sample future analysis . Willing allow genetic testing blood , body fluid tissue specimen . Willing HIV test EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients : A patient eligible he/she follow : Any condition , investigator opinion , may interfere evaluation coexist abnormality immunity subject study protocol . Any condition , investigator opinion , place patient undue risk participate study . Unwillingness undergo testing procedure associate protocol . Hemoglobin &lt; 7 gm/dL . If patient enrol solely obtain leftover pathology specimen , saliva , buccal sample , skin swab , vaginal swab , stool sample , exclusion criterion apply blood withdrawal . Patient Relatives : A genetically relate relative eligible study he/she condition , investigator opinion , may interfere evaluation immune system abnormality subject study protocol . Healthy Volunteers : A healthy volunteer eligible he/she follow : HIV infection . History recurrent severe infection . History underlying malignancy receipt cancer chemotherapy within past 5 year Receipt systemic corticosteroid systemic immunosuppressants/immunomodulators within past 30 day Pregnancy lactate History heart , lung , kidney disease , bleed disorder .</criteria>
