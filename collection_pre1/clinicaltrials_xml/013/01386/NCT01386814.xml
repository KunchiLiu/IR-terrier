	<brief_summary>Aim : To evaluate influence oxygen deficit cognitive performance also architecture sleep efficiency volunteer subject mild moderate exercise hypobaric chamber . SUMMARY : Participants study 30 healthy male volunteer , age 20 40 year , regular physical activity , constitute three group : 1 - without exercise-hypoxia group 10 volunteer subject kind physical exercise hypoxia remain day experiment , 2 - group exercise sea level , compose 10 volunteer undergo protocol exercise physical sea-level , 3 - group exercise hypoxia - 10 volunteer carry protocol exercise treadmill , condition hypoxia ( hypobaric chamber ) . All group first day experiment undergo baseline assessment , laboratory blood analysis salivary spirometric testing . Assessments personality neuropsychological . After baseline assessment , last day experiment , group evaluate 4350m sea level sea , personality test , neuropsychological laboratory . RATIONALE AND BACKGROUND : During exposure environment partial reduction oxygen , human body undergo several physiological psychological change prepare condition . Few study report elevation change cognitive aspect related sleep . MATERIAL AND METHOD : They describe procedure perform , study conduct local adequate infrastructure .</brief_summary>
