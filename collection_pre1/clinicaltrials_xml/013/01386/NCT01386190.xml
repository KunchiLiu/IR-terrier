	<detailed_description>Premature birth recognize single important health problem maternal child health US . Paradoxically , failure thrive obesity know associated prematurity , osteopenia ( condition bone mineral density lower normal ) increase risk fracture , increase risk cardiovascular disease later life . We lack cohesive approach mitigate profound threat health . Despite promise new research demonstrate physical activity stimulate growth muscle bone even intrauterine life ( perhaps metabolic program ) , attempt implement study physical activity intervention premature baby . The challenge substantial include : - measure body composition - assess physical activity - engage caregiver partner intervention - identify plausible testable biological mechanism - design intervention actually increase physical activity match rapid pace motor development early life A developmentally dynamic physical activity intervention design pilot tested-one engages caregiver partner . Using techniques tool far-ranging Dual X-ray Absorbiometry ( DXA ) , smart phone , doubly label water , lightweight , wireless accelerometer develop specifically purpose , work hypothesis one-year intervention augment lean body mass ( primary outcome variable ) improve bone mineralization ratio lean fat tissue ( secondary outcome variable ) . The study gauge impact physical activity intervention balance circulate anabolic mediator ( insulin-like growth factor-I growth hormone bind protein ) inflammation-associated cytokine ( interleukin-6 , interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ) , antagonize muscle bone growth . We additionally : 1. begin explore physical activity influence circulate endothelial progenitor cell , increasingly view marker vascular health early life 2. take advantage prospective , interventional study explore potential genetic determinant growth baby bear prematurely . 3 . Finally , study involve premature infant data associate must view light critical relationship mother baby . The potential broad impact early life intervention recently demonstrate success `` Back-To-Sleep '' campaign mitigate sudden infant death syndrome . Should positive effect augment exercise body composition support , would anticipate widespread benefit prevent long-term health consequence prematurity relatively low cost .</detailed_description>
