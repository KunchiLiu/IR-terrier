	<brief_summary>Approximately 300 million short peripheral intravascular catheter ( PIVs ) sell U.S. 2009 . These short ( &lt; 3 inch ) peripherally insert IV catheter vital provide patient need : 1 ) fluid , electrolyte , nutrient blood product replacement , 2 ) medicine 3 ) diagnostic solution ( dye ) . However , IV catheters inherent risk potential complication may result poor catheter securement stabilization . When PIV catheter properly secure , motion micro-motion within vessel cause injury vein . This damage vein primary cause phlebitis , distress complication PIV therapy . Additional complication inadequate stabilization PIV catheter infiltration , leak insertion site , pain , infection dislodgement . According Royer ( 2003 ) , common reason PIV catheter failure infiltration dislodgement . Infiltration dependent keep extremity still , phlebitis dependent injury due chemical nature drug fluid infuse physical trauma endothelium IV push . The result complication costly serious another vein immediately access infiltrated infusate cause tissue necrosis . An unscheduled restart another PIV catheter cause delay patient treatment , patient discomfort , patient dissatisfaction , safety concern , nurse interruption additional cost . Actual cost associate PIV catheter restarts include material nursing resource ; yet intangible , treatment patient complication patient dissatisfaction may far costly . One way reduce incidence PIV catheter-associated complication use technology help reduce catheter movement thereby improve catheter stabilization . In addition stabilization platform add peripheral IV catheter design , catheter stabilization device modify transparent film dressing also help reduce catheter movement could possibly eliminate need routine catheter site change . Therefore , purpose study : 1 ) compare number PIV securement-related complication PIV catheter restart one stabilization system another stabilization system 2 ) determine system provide cost saving .</brief_summary>
