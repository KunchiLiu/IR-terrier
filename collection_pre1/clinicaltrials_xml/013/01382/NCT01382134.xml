	<brief_summary>Study hypothesis : Desmopressin ( DDAVP ) improve platelet function influence aspirin , hemodilution mild hypothermia Mild hypothermia ( 34-35oC ) know cause platelet dysfunction . This could lead increased surgical bleeding increase transfusion requirement surgery . Although hypothermia-induced platelet dysfunction seem reversible warming , always possible desirable . Desmopressin ( DDAVP ) drug prove efficacy improve platelet function uraemic cirrhosis patient , reduce blood loss select surgery . In recent study , find subcutaneous injection 1.5 mcg ( 1/10th usual dose ) already sufficient fully reverse platelet dysfunction see 32oC . We demonstrate another study prolongation bleed time 20 % hemodiluted sample predicts increase postoperative bleeding total knee replacement . We therefore design study follow last two study DDAVP hypothermia , investigate whether hemodilution affect hypothermia induced platelet dysfunction response DDAVP . In addition , another common cause perioperative platelet dysfunction intake COX inhibitor , particularly aspirin patient . Therefor effect aspirin hypothermia induce platelet dysfunction response DDAVP , also investigate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mild hypothermia ( 34-35oC ) know cause platelet dysfunction . Increased surgical bleeding increase transfusion requirement temperature range report cardiac noncardiac surgery . This degree hypothermia common general anaesthesia , particularly surgery invlove major fluid shift large area exposure patient , e.g . trauma burn patient . Although hypothermia-induced platelet dysfunction seem reversible warming , warm always possible desirable . During major trauma burn surgery , surface warm patient practically difficult . During surgery major blood loss fluid shift , heat loss usually occur rate rapid warm device catch . During neurosurgery , cool may beneficial neurological outcome . Desmopressin ( DDAVP ) drug prove efficacy improve platelet function uraemic cirrhosis patient , reduce blood loss select surgery . In previous vitro study , find desmopressin significantly improve platelet function 32oC . The improvement see low concentration desmopressin vitro , suggest probably dos much small `` standard dose '' ( 15 mcg slow iv subcutaneous ) may useful . In keep vitro study , recent study , find subcutaneous injection 1.5 mcg ( 1/10th usual dose ) already sufficient fully reverse platelet dysfunction see 32oC . One limitation previous two study degree platelet dysfuction observe 32oC relatively mild , around 20 % prolongation closure time PFA-100Â® platelet function analyser . The clinical significance prolongation remain uncertain . However , demonstrate previously another study prolongation closure time &gt; 188 sec 20 % hemodiluted sample predicts increase postoperative bleeding total knee replacement . We therefore design study follow last two study DDAVP hypothermia , investigate whether hemodilution affect hypothermia induced platelet dysfunction response DDAVP . In addition , another common cause perioperative platelet dysfunction intake COX inhibitor , particularly aspirin patient . Therefor effect aspirin hypothermia induce platelet dysfunction response DDAVP , also investigate .</detailed_description>
