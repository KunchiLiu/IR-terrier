	<detailed_description>Regulatory status : Investigational - Randomized Clinical Trial . Registered product antibacterial therapy BACKGROUND Penicillin remain drug choice treatment endemic treponematoses include yaw . This type treatment effective cheap . There , however , disadvantage : pain associated large volume ( 4 ml ) deep i.m . injection , high prevalence self-reported allergy penicillin , structural logistic problem relate treatment base injection drug . Azithromycin , macrolide antibiotic long ( 68 hour ) half-life tissue proven efficacy T.pallidum promise candidate . In two randomized trial , treatment syphilis adult , single 2-g oral dose azithromycin achieve cure rate equivalent standard treatment 2.4 MU penicillin G benzathine . On basis experience venereal syphilis , azithromycin emerge alternative treatment Yaws . It represent accessible treatment could prescribe village health worker therefore enable yaw control easily incorporate primary health-care programme . The product available oral tablet administer single dose 30mg/Kg child 2 g adult . Safety efficacy use azithromycin 30 mg/kg give single dose treatment pediatric patient 6 month age otitis medium establish approved FDA . INFORMED CONSENT All participant ( guardian parent ) eligible enrolment trial accord biological demographic inclusion criterion provide detailed information purpose trial risk benefit participation , accord information list information sheet . Consent provide write . SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION The sample size would 244 ; It calculate basis non-inferiority trial design follow assumption : Statistical power 80 percent ; exclude possibility absolute efficacy azithromycin least 10 % percent less penicillin ; 5 % significance level use one-sided equivalence test proportion ; assume true efficacy agent equivalent 95 percent approximately 10 percent participant would lose follow-up . RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURE A random allocation schedule , stratify accord study group , generate centrally use blocked randomization , random permute block four , 1:1 allocation ratio . The allocation conceal investigator use sequentially number , seal envelope</detailed_description>
