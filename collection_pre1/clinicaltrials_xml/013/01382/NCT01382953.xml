	<brief_summary>The purpose research simplify standard record system heart rhythm . The investigator desire improve ease monitoring cardiac rhythm 24 hour . The investigator intent use small , innovative monitoring patch system relieve patient wear cumbersome uncomfortable recording system . This research trial carry title `` The Simple ECG Monitoring '' Comparison Sternal ECG Recording System Standard ECG Recording System Holter Monitoring . The data investigational device comparative purpose . It use medical personnel study subject treatment diagnostic purpose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Simple ECG Monitoring Trial ( Comparison Novel Recording System With Standard Holter Monitor )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Externally apply cardiac rhythm monitor common tool use diagnose symptom may may relate cardiac rhythm abnormality . Common problem may lead use cardiac rhythm monitor syncope ( loss consciousness ) , near-syncope ( near loss consciousness ) , palpitation ( sensation abnormal heart beat ) , monitor know cardiac rhythm problem like atrial fibrillation . The purpose research confirm clinical value much easier-to-use cardiac rhythm monitoring system , hereafter refer Investigational Monitoring System . Prior discuss investigational monitoring system , review standard electrocardiographic monitoring tool use evaluate heart 's rhythm . Excluding routine 12 lead electrocardiogram take snapshot view heart electrical signal , common tool monitor heart rhythm Holter monitor . A Holter monitor also call ambulatory cardiac monitor . A Holter monitor record every heartbeat 24 hour . It require wear multiple electrode carry record system usually worn belt holster strap . Such system relatively bulky difficult conceal public venue . Also , electrode often disconnect , especially sleep patient unaware electrode detachment occur turn exercise . Moreover , ca n't wear shower . These shortcoming notwithstanding , standard Holters remain standard care .</detailed_description>
