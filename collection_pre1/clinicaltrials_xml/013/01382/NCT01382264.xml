	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine whether use computer assist decision support ( CADS ) system primary care provider ( PCPs ) patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) change quality care relative `` usual care '' group term objective outcome measure glycemic control ( e.g. , A1C , mean blood glucose , frequency hypoglycemic episode ) term subjective rating patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Computer-Assisted Decision Support ( CADS ) System Management Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes account enormous fraction cost health care United States present major burden Military Medical Facilities care retire dependent . There insufficient endocrinologist diabetes specialist manage patient diabetes mellitus ( DM ) significant fraction patient less optimal control ( hemoglobin A1C 's [ A1Cs ] 7 % ) . Multiple barrier prevent necessary improvement glycemic control would result saving live cost . The implementation telemedicine web-based approach patient send blood glucose data , combine relevant laboratory , pharmacy , A1C target set individually patient Primary Care Physician ( PCP ) , trigger clinical decision support system ( DSS ) provider expect improve quality care efficiency care . The computer assist decision support ( CADS ) system integrated Comprehensive Diabetes Management Program ( CDMP ) , web-based , multi-platform , interactive patient provider tool currently operative Walter Reed Health Care System ( WRHCS ) , Wilford Hall Medical Center ( WHMC ) Lackland Air Force Base ( AFB ) , five community clinic affiliate University Hawaii ( UH ) . This exist infrastructure permit CADS test multiple site geographically diverse diverse patient population . This study test safety efficacy CADS use PCPs multi-site , ethnically geographically diverse study 12-month , open , prospective , cluster-randomized , control clinical trial . The specific aim study : ( 1 ) monitor impact intervention : ) measure glycemic control , b ) number diabetes -related hospitalization emergency room visit , c ) control co-morbidities , hyperlipidemia hypertension , ) number clinic visit , e ) change patient ' quality life result intervention ; ( 2 ) evaluate PCPs ' satisfaction technology . We employ cluster-randomized , control , clinical trial involve 30 PCPs recruit approximately 19 patient respective geographic site . After completion recruitment , PCPs patient randomly assign 1 2 `` treatment '' category : CADS , `` Usual Care '' . Input data use CADS system come electronic medical record ( laboratory pharmacy data ) PCP set goal individual patient 's glycemic control . Patients upload blood glucose data modem password-protected , secure server least every 2 week receive modification treatment regimen least every three month PCP , base part recommendation provide CADS system PCP . We compare quantitative outcome measure glycemic control ( primary outcome change patient 's A1C ) , blood pressure , lipid level two treatment group . In addition , subjective qualitative data patient provider obtain .</detailed_description>
