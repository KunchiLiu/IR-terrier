	<brief_summary>While Parkinson 's disease historically define term motor symptomatology , study show non-motor deficit form important part syndrome . Cognitive deficit occur even early stage Parkinson 's disease . These deficit often subtle rise level impairment necessary diagnosis dementia ; however deficits discernable neuropsychological testing may produce subjective complaint cognitive decline mild functional difficulty patient . The traditional pharmacological intervention Parkinson 's disease focus control alleviate motor symptom levodopa dopamine agonist . However , medication treat symptom PD , alter course progression underlie disorder . In contrast , rasagiline , MAO-B inhibitor , recently show benefit consistent possible disease-modifying effect . Given positive intriguing finding see treatment rasagiline , investigator propose study effect medication cognition patient mild moderate stage Parkinson 's disease . Hypotheses : 1 . Rasagiline improve cognitive function , measure performance neuropsychological test PD patient suffer dementia . 2 . Rasagiline negatively affect neuropsychiatric functioning .</brief_summary>
