	<brief_title>The Role Epigenetics Inner City Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma complex , heritable disease affect 11.2 % U.S. population , represent approximately 9 million child 23 million adult . It think asthma may cause interaction multiple genetic factor , whether parent sibling asthma , environmental factor , live inner city . Studying DNA people asthma asthma may help u good understand importance gene involve asthma severity response treatment .</detailed_description>
