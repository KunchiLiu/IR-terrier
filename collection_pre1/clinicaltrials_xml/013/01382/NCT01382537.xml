	<brief_summary>This study focus efficacy treat 80 patient functional limitation activity chronic/recurrent neck shoulder pain . Hypothesis 1 : InterX therapy alone moderate effect reduce pain week 1-2 . Hypothesis 2 : Functional gain great patient receive InterX therapy compare receive placebo treatment . Hypothesis 3 : Chronic neck shoulder pain prevalent patient exhibit radiographic evidence degenerative spondylosis/arthrosis cervical spine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluation subject conduct baseline ( interval 0 ) 2 , 4 , 6 12 week time period . At 26 week , patient contact obtain follow-up questionnaire pain function . After informed consent , participant randomly assign treatment group sham group use InterX5002 , hand hold electrical stimulation unit . Treatment administer three time per week six week . During interval week 1-2 patient either InterX treatment/sham alone . Weeks 3-4 advance patient add standardized rehabilitation exercise program typical chronic neck patient . During week 5-6 , patient schedule treatment use self-administered InterX treatment ( `` home '' Flex ) unit mimic home care account compliance issue attendance monitor . Baseline follow-up assessment consist pain score , NDI , neck fatigue testing , shoulder arm reach task walk treadmill 2 MPH 5 minute ( Neck-walk Index , NWI ) . Neck fatigue test consist prone position extensor muscle exertion resistance tolerance 60 % MVC . Myoelectric sensor tap skin record muscle activity fatigue reach task test . Electromagnetic sensor tap swimmer cap worn patient skin T1 spine shoulder level S1 pelvis walk treadmill shoulder arm reach test . Venipuncture perform evaluation interval collect blood sample quantify circulate inflammatory cytokine . Analysis focus change pain score inflammatory cytokine first two week Hypothesis H1 . Primary functional outcome include neck fatigue progression neck rehabilitation exercise test Hypothesis2 . The third hypothesis test two way . First , quantification degenerative change ( e.g.disc narrow &amp; osteophyte formation ) x-ray ( AP &amp; Lat screen view ) contrast incidence publish literature . Second , pain level baseline stratify quartile compare quantitative tally degenerative change . This data serve basis determine whether future study use degenerative change criterion warrant . Myoelectric activity , fatigue head-pelvic position data use descriptively assess functional difference baseline completion treatment .</detailed_description>
