	<brief_summary>One hundred child born heart defect . Some child require heart surgery within first day life , others wait old . A complication open-heart surgery low blood flow due heart-lung machine cause sudden loss kidney function know acute kidney injury ( AKI ) . AKI cause complication increase hospital length stay increase risk death . Current way identify AKI able 2 3 day occur . Because , specific treatment AKI . If investigator diagnose AKI early , might able treat improve outcome child . NIRS skin monitor detect low blood flow kidney might help diagnose AKI occur operate room . The use NIRS diagnose AKI early focus study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Near Infrared Spectroscopy Detection Acute Kidney Injury Children Following Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) noninvasive tool use continuous monitor regional tissue oxyhemoglobin saturation . Sensors place head abdomen flank use light measure percent oxygen level tissue . Head NIRS correlate oxygen level blood return brain , abrupt decline post-operative cardiac patient show retrospective study predict impend event cardiac arrest . Animal study demonstrate somatic NIRS monitoring able detect flow-induced change regional oxygen level kidney gut directly sensor . Unlike cerebral NIRS monitoring , data regard clinical utility NIRS abdomen flank predict outcomes . Children risk decrease organ perfusion follow cardiac surgery , phenomenon term low cardiac output syndrome ( LCOS ) . It occur approximately 25 % neonate young child follow cardiac surgery . The effect LCOS end organ function , specifically kidney may result acute kidney injury , thereby increase morbidity mortality . The incidence acute kidney injury ( AKI ) follow cardiac surgery report high 40 % . The use NIRS operating room detect AKI pediatric patient undergo cardiac surgery focus proposal Specific Aim 1 : Determine reduction renal NIRS intra-operatively identifies patient AKI Hypothesis : Reduced intra-operative renal NIRS precede diagnosis acute kidney injury increase serum creatinine within 1 3 day post-cardiopulmonary bypass Specific Aim 2 : Determine reduction renal NIRS intra-operatively correlate increase emerge biomarkers AKI . Hypothesis : Reduced intra-operative renal NIRS precede development AKI detect neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin , IL-6 IL-18 least 2 hour .</detailed_description>
