	<detailed_description>This single site , randomize , control , food intervention study design explore effect pulse type variety blood vessel function individual Peripheral Artery Disease . Phase One ( Acute ) : To identify relative potency pulse type ( bean , pea , lentil , chickpea ) vascular activity healthy participant participant Peripheral Artery Disease . Healthy participant ( 10 ) participant Peripheral Artery Disease ( 10 ) ask consume ( random order ) one test food per in-person visit 5 visit schedule minimum 6 day apart . Vascular responsiveness monitor non-invasively peripheral arterial tonometry consumption test food 2 hour post food consumption . Blood sample collect time interval analysis , vascular , inflammatory , metabolic marker well flavonoid present pulse . Phase Two ( Chronic ) : Chronic 8-week study use mixed bean ( pinto , kidney , black , navy ) determine improvement vascular function , cardiovascular risk factor , glycemic control participant Peripheral Artery Disease ( N=75 , 25/group ) . Participants randomly assign one follow three group : ) food contain 0.6 cup mixed beans/day consume 5 day per week ( total amount 3 cup mixed bean per week ) ; , ii ) food contain 0.3 cup mixed beans/day 5 day per week ) ; , iii ) pulse-free food ( control ) consume 5 days/week . A total 3 in-person visit screen , baseline final require 8-week study schedule . Assessments vascular function , cognitive function , food dietary intake preference , flavonoid level cardiovascular risk marker blood urine , glycemic control , anthropometrics complete baseline 8 week . Phase Three ( Follow-Up : An 8-week follow-up assessment subset participant ( n=10/group , 3 group ) Peripheral Artery Disease do 2 , 4 , 8 week . Assessments vascular function , cognitive function , food dietary intake , flavonoid level cardiovascular risk marker blood urine , glycemic control , anthropometrics complete . These assessment enable u determine length time benefit pulse consumption retain .</detailed_description>
