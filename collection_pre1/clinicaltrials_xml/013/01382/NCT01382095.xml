	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine immunization dscCfaE without modify E. coli heat labile enterotoxin , LTR192G , safe immunogenic administer transcutaneously use skin wet-patch . If vaccine find safe adequately immunogenic human , phase 2b vaccination/challenge study would undertake evaluate vaccine safety allow preliminary assessment efficacy . With favorable evidence safety , immunogenicity , efficacy , complement advance standard methodology combine multiple adhesins appropriate LT enterotoxoid form , multivalent vaccine would construct evaluated clinical development .</detailed_description>
