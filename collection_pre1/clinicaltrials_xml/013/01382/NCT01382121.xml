	<detailed_description>There dramatic increase prevalence overweight obese child region Canada . In fact , Canada one high rate childhood obesity compare developed country . This disconcert preventative condition strongly associate risk future disease , adult obesity , insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes , cardiovascular problem psychosocial distress . This trend drive factor develop effective strategy assessment intervention . Aerobic fitness ability cardiovascular respiratory system deliver oxygen work muscle utilize oxygen produce energy . Aerobic fitness strong indicator physical activity also correlate aforementioned disease . It measure peak ventilatory oxygen ( peak VO2 ; mL/kg min ) , evaluate use maximal incremental exercise protocol treadmill , whereby expire gas analyze use metabolic cart . Aerobic fitness value inconsistent youth , particularly obese youth . This discrepancy due low self-efficacy . Self-efficacy refers belief one power capability produce effect . Low self-efficacy prominent obese youth lack actual perceive physical competence social support . This may translate less effort invest population physical activity , token , aerobic fitness test . To date , experimental study attempt address psychological variable apply intervention achieve accurate peak VO2 value obese adolescent . Peer model demonstration particular behavior learn observationally powerful source self-efficacy . This mode learn successful increase consumption new food ( 36 subject ) activity level ( 100 subject ) child . Based success , would suggest investigator could confidently apply study . Therefore main objective examine effect model intervention ( DVD film ) self-efficacy peak VO2 obese youth maximal treadmill test . Models demonstrate articulate increase confidence perform test offer variety strategy cope maximal effort overcome associate challenge test ( e.g . shortness breath , sweat , increased heart rate ) . The model participant study . Obese ( define Body Mass Index great 95th percentile age gender ) youth ( 10-17 year , N = 40 ) receive write consent parent guardian ask participate study . Prior undertake aerobic fitness test , child require seek approval family physician complete Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PAR-Q ) . Participants randomize baseline measure complete one two condition : peer model intervention control ensure group equivalency . Following randomization , participant intervention group watch peer model DVD film lab . Those control group view DVD film similar length nutrition . After seven day , participant group return follow-up . One week suitable interval provide time participant reflect information receive DVD film minimize external confounding factor , provide enough time see change fitness ( require approximately 3 month ) . Prior second exercise test , participant watch DVD film view previous week . Afterwards , participant complete peak VO2 test self-reported measure . All participant ask change normal physical activity pattern week . To complete peak VO2 test , participant require complete maximal incremental exercise protocol treadmill . The test conduct trained personnel terminate participant unable continue protocol , vital sign warrant discontinuation . The result RCT provide accurate measurement aerobic fitness , crucial assess health status , risk disease assist plan program aim improve quality life adolescent .</detailed_description>
