	<brief_title>Reamer Irrigator Aspirator ( RIA ) vs Autogenous Iliac Crest Bone Graft ( AICBG ) Treatment Non-unions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All subject pre-screened treat physician . Subjects present nonunion long bone invite speak research coordinator regard study . An internet base randomization system use allocate subject treatment group . Participating site give unique ID password log secure website register subject . Treating physician use 1 2 bone graft harvest method patient nonunion long bone require graft . The first method involve harvest bone graft iliac crest area . The second method involve use RIA harvest bone graft femoral canal . Clinical assessment occur time hospital admission ( baseline ) , post-op day 1 , 2 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month 24 month post-surgery . Surgical procedure nonunion site standardize vary greatly . Surgeons may use bone graft substitute recipient site discretion . We however , standardize surgical technique harvest graft donor site .</detailed_description>
