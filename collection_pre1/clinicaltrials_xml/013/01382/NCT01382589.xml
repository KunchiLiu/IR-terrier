	<brief_title>Afamelanotide Narrow-Band Ultraviolet B ( NB-UVB ) Light Treatment Nonsegmental Vitiligo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational product , afamelanotide , synthetic analogue human alpha melanocyte stimulate hormone ( alpha-MSH ) . The early described function alpha-MSH ability stimulate melanin synthesis skin therefore stimulate pigmentation . Vitiligo common depigmentation disorder . Interventions treatment vitiligo include phototherapy narrow-band ( NB ) ultraviolet B ( UVB ) irradiation ( NB-UVB ) . The purpose study look efficacy afamelanotide , combine narrow-band ultraviolet B ( NB-UVB ) light , patient nonsegmental vitiligo . Afamelanotide expect speed repigmentation induce NB-UVB light , lead reduce frequency dose NB-UVB .</detailed_description>
