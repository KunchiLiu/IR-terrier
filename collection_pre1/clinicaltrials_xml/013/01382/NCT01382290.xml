	<brief_summary>Diffusion-weighted ( DW ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) image well establish method detect acute injury brain use child undergo MRI brain scan Children 's Healthcare Atlanta . The possibility use DW MRI study area body , spinal cord , recognise great clinical potential . However , two main problem hinder clinical application technique ; firstly , extreme motion sensitivity technique mean respiratory motion hamper clinical study . Secondly , close proximity spinal cord bone spinal column complicates application technique develop brain spine . Recently , several technique develop address problem available MRI scanner use Children 's Healthcare Atlanta . We wish evaluate well technique work child routine clinical setting . For reason wish add single scan spine image protocol child receive routine scan brain spine . This permit u evaluate image quality normal abnormal spine . We plan enrol 60 patient normal spine 30 patient abnormal spine . No additional sedation and/or contrast require additional imaging time diffusion study less 10 minute . Parental consent pre-requisite patient enrol study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background significance Diffusion-weighted ( DW ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) image well establish method detect acute ischaemic injury brain increasingly apply study brain structure organisation ( 1,2 ) . The technique provide information motion water molecule use ionise radiation . The possibility use DW MRI probe neuronal microstructures highly order neuronal system , spinal cord , recognise great clinical potential . However , combination susceptibility artefacts surround bony structure , motion cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , carotid vertebral artery pulsation respiratory motion hamper clinical study . Recently , several technique develop address problem ( 3,4 ) two method shortly available use Scottish Rite campus CHOA . We propose apply DW image spine follow group patient : 1 . Patients tethered cord . 2 . Patients Chiari I malformation . 3 . Normal child undergo MRI spine . All study would perform child already refer MRI diffusion sequence would perform requested MRI exam complete . No additional sedation and/or contrast would require . Informed consent would request parent study . The additional imaging time require diffusion study would less 10 minute . We plan enrol 60 patient normal spine 30 patient abnormal spine study . Tethered cord . Tethered spinal cord group complex developmental malformation spinal cord common cause child repair spina-bifida myelomeningocele . Although usually operate shortly birth , repair myelomeningocele degree tether . The basic problem exacerbate child grow spinal cord grow quickly spinal column , spinal cord must able freely ascend inside spinal column growth . If various abnormal structure hold onto spinal cord stretch spinal cord , lead chronic local ischaemia , turn lead progressive loss function . The sign symptom associate cord tether often non-specific poorly understood . Diffusion MRI may useful monitoring tethered cord since initial study adults cervical spondylosis imply sensitive conventional MRI image depict pathological change within spinal cord . Hence diffusion MRI potential sensitive method determine cord stress due tether hence need surgery . Chiari I malformation A Chiari I malformation condition characterise abnormal inferior projection cerebellar tonsil foramen magnum , upper cervical spinal canal . If degree projection small condition generally refer tonsilar ectopia . Chiari I malformation may associate anomaly , commonly hydrosyringomyelia ( turn lead neurologic deficit scoliosis ) hydrocephalus . Symptoms Chiari I malformation often begin infancy , although may delay adolescence adulthood . Symptoms often non-specific usually include headache , vomit , muscle weakness head face , difficulty swallowing , vary degree mental impairment . Paresis paralysis arm leg may also occur . As grow old , adolescent adults Chiari I malformation previously asymptomatic may show sign progressive brain impairment , involuntary , rapid , downward eye movement . The pathophysiology syrinx development ( hydrosyringomyelia ) understood state chronic interstitial edema spinal cord due accumulation extracellular fluid . A diagnosis Chiari I malformation generally make use conventional MRI scan often incidental find evaluation abnormality , make interpretation significance image finding difficult . Patients symptoms potentially indicate abnormally position tonsil normal imaging finding , tonsilar ectopia mild Chiari I malformation . In case cerebellar tonsil clearly abnormal , accord conventional imaging diagnostic criterion , difficult determine cause symptom . They may cause low tonsil , case surgical decompression would perform , may simply incidental finding . A problem determine strategy manage patient Chiari I malformation criterion surgical intervention nebulous . Some patient symptomatic minor degree tonsillar ectopia others severe displacement cerebellar tonsil upper spinal canal symptom . Since correction Chiari I malformation require surgery generally reserve patient show clear evidence progressive clinical symptom . Any technique provide information pathological change within spinal cord would important complement clinical data anatomical information provide conventional MRI . At present difficult predict patient predispose develop syringomyelia basis conventional imaging finding alone DW-MRI may able provide useful complementary information . Normal patient . To date information regard value diffusion within spinal cord come limited number study normal , adult , volunteer . It known diffusion property brain vary significantly age expect diffusion property spine show similar variation . Thus , order able properly interpret result study child suspect pathology necessary control group order allow normal value different age range establish .</detailed_description>
