	<brief_summary>Adalimumab fully human monoclonal antibody tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-Î± ) approve rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) refractory disease modify anti rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) treatment severe , active progressive RA adult previously treat methotrexate . However , almost one third patient response approximately 15 % develop antibody towards adalimumab ( ATA ) 6 month course treatment . There relationship adalimumab concentration clinical response obtain 6 month treatment . Furthermore adalimumab concentration measure 3 month initiation seem predict clinical response 6 month . There important inter individual pharmacokinetic variability adalimumab . Side effect may occur recommend dose 3 month treatment generally require estimate clinical response . A therapeutic drug monitoring could help clinician early adjust dose optimize response avoid dose related side effect . To date definite adalimumab target concentration predictive clinical response allow pharmacologic monitoring .</brief_summary>
