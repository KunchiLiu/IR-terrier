	<brief_title>Efficacy Local Tolerability Topically Applied Heparin Suitability Newly Constructed Primary Arteriovenous Fistulas Patients Planned Haemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical dilemma surround maturation suitability AVF patient undergoing hemodialysis suggest requirement medication add standard therapy order help maturation suitability newly create AVF . Numerous research paper publish past 25 year indicate heparin might positive impact main factor involve early failure native AVF mature . In total 56 eligible patient enrol give informed consent . Screening take place precede 6 week schedule AVF creation . Only patient receive Brescia - Cimino ( radio - cephalic ) fistula distal ulnar artery basilica vein , proximal radial artery transpose basilica vein , brachial artery transpose basilica vein brachial artery cephalic vein later randomize . Patients randomly assign equal proportion ( group 28 patient ) receive either topically apply heparin ( Heparin 2,400 IU /ml Cutaneous Spray ) placebo use computer-generated randomization . Participants member study team blind treatment assignment . Patients instructed use administer study medication consecutive 24 week follow randomization . Assessment primary endpoint ( suitability newly construct primary arteriovenous fistula ) do 7th week ( ± 1 week ) first study drug administration . The suitability unassisted patency local safety tolerability physician patient AVF also determine 12 week ( ± 1 week ) 24 week ( ± 1 week ) first study drug administration . Administration study medication stop week 24 randomization .</detailed_description>
