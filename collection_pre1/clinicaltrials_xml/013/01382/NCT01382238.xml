	<brief_summary>Dolutegravir ( DTG , GSK1349572 ) integrase inhibitor currently Phase 3 clinical trial treatment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . A granule formulation develop alternative current tablet formulation administration pediatric population . This single-center , randomize , open-label , 5-way crossover study healthy adult subject . The study evaluate relative bioavailability 50 mg granule formulation dolutegravir administer 1 ) directly mouth ; 2 ) purify water ; 3 ) Contrex brand water ; 4 ) milk-based infant formula compare current 50 mg tablet formulation administer tap water . Safety evaluations serial PK sample collect treatment period . A taste assessment granule also perform . A follow-up visit occur 5-7 day last dose study drug . Pharmacokinetic assessment study include area concentration-time curve time zero ( pre-dose ) extrapolate infinite time ( AUC ( 0-infinity ) ) , area concentration-time curve time zero ( pre-dose ) last time quantifiable concentration within subject across treatment ( AUC ( 0-t ) ) , maximum observed concentration ( Cmax ) , terminal phase half-life ( tÂ½ ) , lag time observation drug concentration sample matrix ( tlag ) , time occurrence Cmax ( tmax ) , concentration 24 hour post-dose ( C24 ) , apparent clearance follow oral dosing ( CL/F ) .</brief_summary>
