	<detailed_description>Diabetes pandemic problem catastrophic effect physical , psychological , economic life patient family , also place significant burden healthcare system . Changes integumentary system lead plantar foot ulceration , increase risk limb amputation death . Specifically , limitation ankle joint dorsiflexion ( equinus deformity ) implicate major deform force development chronicity plantar foot ulceration diabetic population . A well mechanistic understanding intrinsic change diabetic Achilles tendon would assist explain potentially prevent development chronic foot ulceration due equinus deformity . This study evaluate relationship limb loss progression change see collagen metabolic marker diabetic Achilles tendon . This assess collect Achilles tendon sample subject various stage ulcer development limb loss also demonstrate equinus deformity . All Achilles tendon sample collect time Achilles lengthen procedure . There five subject group consist subject identify : 1 ) preulcerative plantar foot lesion 2 ) plantar ulceration without history amputation require amputation 3 ) plantar ulceration undergo digital amputation 4 ) plantar ulceration undergo transmetatarsal amputation 5 ) plantar ulceration undergo Chopart 's proximal amputation . Further , systemic change ( vasculopathy , peripheral neuropathy , nephropathy ) also correlate . The independent variable follow : 1 ) collagen metabolic marker 2 ) systemic change . The dependent variable limb loss progression assess categorically ( 5 group ) . The 5 phase study include : - Phase 1- Eligibility Assessment . Type I Type II diabetic patient present Georgetown University Hospital Limb Salvage Center evaluate inclusion study base inclusion/exclusion criterion . - Phase 2- Interview examination . Subjects complete comprehensive medical history , physical exam , blood work ( per Standard Care . The PI SI perform ankle joint range motion examination Semmes-Weinstein 5.07 monofilament examination ( per Standard Care . A comprehensive metabolic panel order include hemoglobin A1C , BUN , CR ( per Standard Care ) . Patients refer vascular surgery department noninvasive and/or invasive vascular study ( per standard care ) patient schedule surgery time . - Phase 3- Surgery Tissue Collection . Surgery perform may include ulcer debridement , soft tissue bone reconstruction , amputation ( per SOC- patient identify demonstrate equinus deformity agree Achilles tendon lengthen procedure along ulcer debridement , soft tissue bone reconstruction , amputation include study . Achilles tendon lengthen consider adjunctive SOC procedure surgical management diabetic foot ) . All subject Achilles tendon lengthen procedure perform primary ( PK ) sub-investigators ( JS CA ) . A tissue sample ( 20mg ) Achilles tendon collected time . This tissue preserve dry ice container ship Midwestern University process sub-investigator ( CC ) . The specimen label numerically predetermine subject number . No patient identify information sample . - Phase 4- Tissue Data Processing . Assays perform tissue sample measure specific metabolic marker diabetic Achilles tendon . Tendon collagen concentration determine via quantification collagen specific amino acid , hydroxyproline high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) fluorometric detection . The extent collagen cross-linking determine measure amount pyridinium cross-link hydroxylysylpyridinoline also assess though HPLC . RT-PCR also perform determine expression various MMPs TIMPs . The blood marker process Georgetown University Hospital . The Department Vascular Surgery Georgetown University perform noninvasive invasive study result finding report investigator . - Phase 5-Data Analysis . The result physical examination , laboratory study , vascular study , tissue assay collect evaluate .</detailed_description>
