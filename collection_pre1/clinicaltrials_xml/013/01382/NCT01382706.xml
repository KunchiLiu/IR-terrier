	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give docetaxel lapatinib ditosylate together second-line therapy work treat patient stage IV bladder cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving docetaxel lapatinib ditosylate together may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy 1250 mg lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) give combination docetaxel prolong progression-free survival subject metastatic , previously treat transitional cell carcinoma ( TCC ) relative historical control . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy 1250 mg Lapatinib give combination docetaxel objective response rate overall survival . II . To study tolerability safety 1250 mg lapatinib give combination docetaxel assess incidence nature Grade 3 , 4 serious adverse event ( AEs ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess expression status epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER-2 ) tumor tissue and/or circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) potential predictor response therapy . II . To evaluate number CTC 's present 7.5mLs peripheral blood predictor disease progression response treatment bladder cancer set combination therapy lapatinib docetaxel . III . To evaluate effect lapatinib human molecular level target phosphorylation activity AKT/extracellular-regulated kinase ( ERK ) pathway prior treatment lapatinib . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
