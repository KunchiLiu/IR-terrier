	<brief_summary>The aim current study set find human model negative symptom base clinical observation chronic cannabis user express negative symptom characterize neurocognitive electrophysiology characteristic like patient suffer schizophrenia . Towards end first part study set explore weather chronic cannabis user 's express negative symptom similar patient suffer schizophrenia . The second part study explore neurocognitive electrophysiology characteristic cannabis user express negative symptom . This data compare parallel data schizophrenia patient predominantly negative symptom . Several line biological genetic evidence support cannabinoid hypothesis schizophrenia . Particularly , significant clinically possible involvement cannabinoid system neural basis negative symptom . This hypothesis base clinical finding chronic cannabis use cause combination symptom include apathy , avolition , lack interest , passivity , cognitive impairment , so-called `` amotivational syndrome , '' resemble core negative symptom schizophrenia behavioral level well brain level . Both associated function integrity frontal lobe due role create self-directed behavior , deficit may underlie alogia , anhedonia , flat affect . Despite aforementioned similarity , date , documentation relationship . Recognition chronic cannabis user share similar constellation symptom similar neurocognitive electrophysiology characteristic could provide key develop human model negative symptom essential tool comprehensive understanding etiology negative symptom development innovative therapy . The investigator Hypothesize That Chronic Cannabis Users Would Express Same Constellation Behaviors Negative Symptoms Schizophrenia ; well similar neurocognitive electrophysiology characteristic</brief_summary>
