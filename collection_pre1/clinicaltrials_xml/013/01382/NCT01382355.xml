	<brief_summary>Advances transplant pharmacotherapy lead improved one-year patient graft survival kidney transplant recipient , translate enhance long-term survival . An explanation disparity outcomes negative role antibody transplant graft survival . There currently exist maintenance immunosuppression target antibodies standard practice aim remove circulate donor specific antibody upon detection antibody mediate graft damage prior detection rejection . There exist insufficiency data regard patient donor characteristic , change immunosuppression , risk viral donor patient seropositivity risk non-compliance development antibody . By measure antibody level blood specific time period transplant , may better understand type patient develop antibody , antibody appear change transplant medication may affect antibody . The propose project examine multifactorial risk associate development appearance donor-specific antibody first year post-kidney transplant . The data collect provide historical perspective preliminary pilot data support proposal prospective antibody monitor justify pre-emptively treating antibody absence clinical sign rejection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Donor Specific Antibody ( DSA ) Monitoring Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Organ transplantation effective treatment several end-stage organ disease . Preventing rejection transplant organ remain premier challenge . According humoral theory , donor specific antibody ( DSA ) major cause chronic rejection allograft loss . Despite , evidence link human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) antibodies allograft dysfunction loss , doubt remain cause-and-effect relationship confirmation evidence necessary help facilitate change transplant practice . Prospective monitoring de novo DSA serum patient receive transplant may allow early detection , evaluation , characterization factor lead development antibody prior development clinical manifestation graft dysfunction . The contribution major histocompatibility complex ( MHC ) Class I Class II antibody transplant outcomes well document . However , emerge evidence antibody mediate rejection severity outcome may involve protein antibody go beyond HLA Class I II . A number assay available test additional antibody proteins currently use widespread patient monitor part due lack data justify commercial use . This pilot study prospectively evaluate presence and/or emergence unique antibody , ( I.E . MICA antigen , IgG3 C1Q ) serial sample serum , confirm reject utility incorporating assay routine patient monitoring might provide early evidence emerge rejection . Serum sample store indefinitely future kidney transplant research project .</detailed_description>
