	<brief_summary>The purpose study look meibomian gland tear film use new clinical instrument market Canada recently acquire Centre Contact Lens Research . These compare two group individual , one group visible meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD ) one group individual normal meibomian gland appearance . The hypothesis difference normal individual individual MGD respect appearance meibomian gland certain tear film attribute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Meibography Tear Scan Using Oculus Keratograph 4</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meibomian gland dysfunction ( MGD ) common clinical condition major cause evaporative dry eye associate discomfort , visual disturbance contact lens intolerance . In MGD , meibum often abnormal , progressively change color clear yellow consistency liquid thick toothpaste-like . Evaluation meibomian gland ( MG ) lipid layer vital . In typical clinical setting , lid lid margin evaluation often perform via slitlamp biomicroscopy ; however , structure meibomian gland often clearly visualized slit lamp use isolation . Trans-illumination lid necessary clearly view gland . To date , infrared meibography method available assessment meibomian gland structure . It primarily regard laboratory-specific procedure meibomian gland drop assessment people suffer MGD . Recently , Keratograph 4 release OCULUS ( Wetzlar , Germany ) . In addition corneal contact lens assessment feature , Keratograph 4 offer tear film ( TF ) scan module able objectively assess tear break-up time ( TBUT ) colour cod map highlight region tear break . High-resolution image tear meniscus also obtain used subjective assessment tear meniscus height ( TMH ) help built-in software . Preliminary research Centre Contact Lens Research demonstrate ability capture meibography image upper low lid . The objective study collect meibography , TBUT TMH data use Keratograph 4 normal participant ( MGD ) participant MGD compare two group use meibomian gland evaluator . The primary outcome variable meibography image , TBUT TMH . The study hypothesis difference normal participant participant MGD , respect meibography image ( MG drop ) , TBUT measurement ( area time break ) TMH measurement .</detailed_description>
