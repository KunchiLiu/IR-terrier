	<detailed_description>The complication anticancer treatment threaten effectiveness therapy lead dose reduction , increase healthcare cost , impair patient ' quality life . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) symptoms frequent side effect antineoplastic chemotherapy behind bone-marrow depression , nausea vomit represent mainly refer one . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) mucositis , represent injury rest alimentary tract beyond oral mucositis , become recognize increasingly toxicity associate many standard-dose chemotherapy regimen . Although clinician consider `` minor complaint '' , many patient ( 40-100 % ) treat chemotherapy and/or expose ionize radiation suffer disease . After chemotherapy , GI mucositis prominent small intestine , also occur esophagus , stomach , large intestine . The GI symptom related mucositis mimic GI disease ( dyspepsia , reflux disease abdominal pain diarrhea ) . Alimentary tract mucositis increase morbility mortality contribute rise health care cost . The comprehension pathophysiology shed light rationale target specific pathway use specific agent prevention treatment . Since role chemotherapy onset GI motility disorder addition minor GI complaint clarify yet . Understanding pathophysiology mucositis , measure score , essential progress research care direct common side-effect anticancer therapy . Currently , strong evidence support recommendation use certain agent ( mucosal surface protectants , antiinflammatory antimicrobial agent , growth factor , etc ) .</detailed_description>
