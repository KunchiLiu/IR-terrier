	<detailed_description>Laparoscopy spread vascular surgery surgical branch still remain hands minority surgeon . Splenic artery aneurysm ( SAA ) exception rule : easy-to-reach position relatively safe control favour progressive diffusion laparoscopic technique . An increase number case manage minimally invasive surgery originate number case report small series publish recent literature . These paper unanimous signal feasibility , safety effectiveness laparoscopic technique well appreciation patient -often young females- harbour disease . However , perplexity still remain concern real potential laparoscopy specific field , particular consider spectrum technical solution perform , splenectomy rate feasibility result reconstructive surgery . The low incidence disease justifies low number publish laparoscopic series enrol adequate number patient , particular , absence paper compare open laparoscopic technique . This study report first prospective randomize comparison different surgical technique .</detailed_description>
