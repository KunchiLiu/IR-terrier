	<detailed_description>Research effort affect adolescent smoking cessation focus detained teen . This opportune time enhance interest smoking cessation subsequent quit rate . In addition , little known mechanism smoke cessation adolescent , generally . The long-term objective research increase understand effective smoking intervention understudied adolescent high risk continue smoke adulthood . This RCT use 2 x 2 group design investigate Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) versus Relaxation Therapy ( RT ) , Cognitive Behavior Therapy ( CBT ) versus Self-Help Programming ( SHP ) . Treatments provide brief stay detention adolescent follow release . The investigator seek increase quit rate post-release , investigator examine moderate mediate effect motivation , anger , self-efficacy . The investigator study main effect treatment well whether combination MI/CBT effective treatment enhance quit rate . Methodology-Adolescents age 13-19 , detain Rhode Island Training School ( RITS ; ethnic breakdown : 32 % Caucasian , 35 % African American , 22 % Latino , 5 % Asian American , 6 % racial background ) , approximately 10 % resident female . Adolescents eligible : 1 ) smoke &gt; 5 cigarette day 2 ) estimate length 4-7 week stay detention . Special attention give recruitment girl member minority group . All teens meet inclusion criterion initially introduce study RITS authorize personnel briefly explain study . Teens approach person facility . If teen interested study project staff approach teen . All purpose procedure fully described time , question answered.It also emphasize participate result repercussion term detention facility . In order participate study , eligible teen require read ( read ) sign inform consent/assent form . Teens meet screen criterion decline participation study thank time . Teens meet inclusion criterion , decline participation ask fill brief , anonymous questionnaire contain demographic information item concern previous incarceration . If agree , ask read sign inform consent/assent form . The purpose brief questionnaire allow u determine sample teen agree participate significantly different decline . After obtain informed consent/assent , teens complete baseline assessment protocol . This assessment occur RITS take approximately 105 minute complete . All information collect interview train Research Assistant ( RA ) , include orientation project . These assessment identical condition occur within 24 hr . consent/assent . Contact information include ; address , number , nickname , employer info. , school info , driver 's license number , case worker ( CW ) , probation officer ( PO ) , two family friend would able locate recorded.Locator information include name , address , phone number , relation teen.Teens ask sign letter address locator explain participate research project URI give permission locator provide project staff information locate him/her.This letter provide information nature project.Locators contact attempt reach teen fail . Next , teens randomly assign MI/CBT RT/ SHP . To optimize chance establish causal relationship treatment condition differential treatment outcome urn randomization employ ( 1 ) . For purpose age ( &lt; 16 vs. &gt; 16 ) , family history smoking ( none vs. first degree biological relative ) , childhood onset conduct disorder aggressive symptom ( yes vs. ) factor urn randomization procedure , make likely group balance variables.Treatment provider know intervention condition assignment advance.Research assistant blind intervention condition assignment throughout study . The RT/SHP experimental comparison condition . Teens MI/CBT condition receive individual session MI , follow two three session group CBT.The MI session 60-90 minute length.The focus establish rapport building motivation . The counselor explore teen 's reason enter treatment , prior treatment experience , previous attempt change use , possible goal treatment , substance effect expectancy , perception self-efficacy .

Teens RT/SHP condition receive one session individual RT , follow two three session SHP group format . The RT condition design comparable time MI , thus participant condition meet alone therapist 60-90 minute one occasion . These session focus instruction muscle relaxation meditation , teens give feedback handout use relaxation technique . This relaxation training protocol use treatment condition number IRB approve intervention study . SHP utilizes Nicotine Anonymous ( NiA ) approach group treatment . Therefore , 12-step philosophy , tools tradition NiA , gain give nicotine discuss along tip smoke . Each 2-3 session 60-75 minute length . A thirty minute assessment ( FFU1 ) occur individual MI RT session . A 45 minute session occur end teen 's last group session ( FFU2 ) . These assessment conduct RA blind treatment assignment.This assessment tap retention experimental treatment effects.Incentives include snack individual attention . A research assistant schedule post-release three month FU prior teen 's release RITS . The assessment vary depend teen release , however assessment take place 3 month release date teen . The remain FU , six month post release , schedule RA conduct previous session . All FU assessment approximately 60-90 minute length conduct person private office University Rhode Island , train RA blind treatment assignment . Assessments consist question regard post-release behavior previous charge , smoke , self-efficacy , utilize measure use baseline assessment .</detailed_description>
