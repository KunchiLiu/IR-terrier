	<brief_summary>Currently , due advantage noninvasive , localize , rapid , painless easily repeatable impression specimen , technique ideal method investigate ocular surface disorder diagnosis clinically obvious detect post-operative change without tissue damage . Using impression cytology primary diagnosis follow-up ocular surface squamous neoplasia , include therapy topical mitomycin C well-studied . [ 29 ] . In addition application describe , pterygium another disease interest . Pterygium , common disease ocular surface , high recurrence rate surgical excision . [ 30-33 ] However , exact etiology mechanism recurrence unknown . A transformation phenotypic characteristic conjunctival fibroblast may play important role . Due concern improvement treatment , important explore change cytomorphology pterygium operation , identify risk factor develop recurrence , , furthermore , clarify etiology mechanism . Some ophthalmologist may think procedure time-consuming routine examination outpatient clinic . [ 34 ] However , National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) , one large tertiary medical center Taiwan , charge big part difficult case ocular surface . With need precise diagnosis delicate clinical skill , investigator competent meaningful program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Impression Cytology Observe Cytological Changes Ocular Surface Cells Various Ocular Surface Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Impression cytology simple , noninvasive technique widely use aid diagnosis several disorder ocular surface . The first use impression cytology specimens diagnosis ocular surface squamous neoplasia report France 1954 Larmande Timsit . [ 1 ] In English language literature , Egbert et al [ 2 ] 1977 document use cellulose acetate filter detect goblet cell density patient dry eye syndrome . Traditionally , cytology specimen obtain press cellulose acetate ( Millipore ) filter onto surface globe , air-dried stain PAS . [ 2 ] The procedure usually painless even without anesthesia . The filter remove 1 3 superficial cell layer conjunctiva cornea . Since first application ocular surface squamous neoplasia dry eye syndrome , [ 1,2 ] use impression cytology expand include stag conjunctival squamous metaplasia , [ 3,4 ] diagnosis ocular surface squamous neoplasia , [ 5-11 ] follow-up ocular surface squamous neoplasia topical mitomycin-C , [ 10 ] limbal stem-cell deficiency , [ 12,13 ] specific viral infection , [ 14-16 ] vitamin A deficiency , [ 17,18 ] epithelial cell storage disorder , [ 19 ] allergic disorder , [ 19 ] conjunctival melanosis malignant melanoma , [ 20 ] psoriasis [ 21 ] . The technique additional advantage preserve limbal stem cell , occur basal layer limbal epithelium responsible renewal corneal epithelium throughout life . Since ocular surface squamous neoplasia preferentially involve limbus , limbal stem cell potentially reduce number surgical biopsy . The progressive loss limbal stem cell result limbal stem-cell deficiency , conjunctivalization cornea corneal opacity . Thus , impression cytology offer safer alternative diagnosis repeat biopsy . With impression cytology , morphology corneal conjunctival epithelial cell , stain behavior , nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio could observe detail . Other important characteristic goblet cell density , degree keratinization epithelial cell , quality cell-to-cell cohesion , condensation nuclear chromatin could also detect proper specimen . [ 3 , 22-26 ] Furthermore , improvement immunocytochemical stain confocal microscopy , specimens impression cytology analyze complicate ocular disorder cytokeratins 3 19 useful classification limbal stem cell deficiency [ 27 ] mucin secretion goblet cell evaluate confocal microscopy [ 28 ] .</detailed_description>
