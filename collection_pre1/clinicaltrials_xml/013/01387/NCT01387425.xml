	<brief_title>Efficacy And Safety Of Smoking Cessation With Varenicline Tartrate In Diabetic Smokers : ( DIASMOKE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Cigarette smoking harm nearly every system human body , thus cause broad range disease , many fatal . In particular , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) important cause death smoke ( 1 ) . Both diabetes mellitus cigarette smoke well-known risk factor development CVD atherothrombosis ( 2,3 ) . It acknowledge endothelial cell dysfunction clot activation exclusive diabetes . Cigarette smoking also associate functional change endothelium hypercoagulability state ( 4 ) . It likely combine injurious effect high blood glucose together cigarette smoke may responsible observe accelerated course vascular complication diabetic patient smoke . Findings cross-sectional prospective study appear support notion consistently show heighten risk morbidity premature death associate development micro- macro-vascular disease combination smoking diabetes . There evidence smoking increase risk coronary artery disease type 2 diabetes ( 5,6 ) . For example , prospective cohort 7,401 female nurse type 2 diabetes , cigarette smoking find strongly associate risk coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk increase number cigarette smoke per day ( 7 ) . Based data 4,540 patient type 2 diabetes follow UK Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) , smoke show increase risk coronary heart disease male females type 2 diabetes . The estimate Risk Rate ( RR ) occurrence fatal non-fatal MI sudden death attributable smoking 1.35 ( 8 ) . Smoking also increase risk stroke ( 9 ) . Based patient type 2 diabetes enrol UKPDS , mathematical model include major confounding variable ( include age , sex , atrial fibrillation , etc ) estimate non-smoking male current age 67 year would 6.9 % probability stroke within 5 year compare 10.5 % probability smoke male age ( 10 ) . Moreover , several study show smoke promotes onset progression nephropathy type 2 diabetes ( 11-13 ) . In logistic regression analysis examine association gender , age , stage nephropathy , smoke status , cigarette pack-years , hypertension , total cholesterol , triglyceride , Glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) , Blood pressure ( BP ) , current former smoking ( P = 0.0012 ) number pack-years ( P = 0.011 ) show great predictor progression nephropathy ( 12 ) . Smoking also show exacerbate marker kidney failure population , microalbuminuria ( 14 ) . In addition , stop smoke show reduce progressive damage kidney comparison continue smoke type 2 diabetes ( 14 ) . Because prevalence smoking among people diabetes remains elevate ( 15 ) , decrease exposure tobacco product public health imperative also subject diabetes . Moreover , recent US Clinical Guidelines Treatment Tobacco Dependence ( 2008 ) list diabetes , along comorbid medical condition , target group smoke cessation treatment , due increase health risk associate disease smoking ( 16 ) . It must also note along know modifiable cardiovascular risk factor ( e.g . raise glycemic level , elevate cholesterol level , high Body Mass Index ) smoking appear relevant reduction morbidity mortality patient population . Risk management parameter CVD include smoke cessation may reduce morbidity mortality tighten glycemic control ( 17,18 ) . Surprisingly , little data available literature smoke cessation intervention specific disease group . Also , specific information efficacy safety new pharmacological support smoker diabetes find . Varenicline partial agonist α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor cause partial stimulation competitively inhibit nicotine binding . Recently , randomize , control clinical trial show varenicline dose 1 mg twice day superior placebo smoke cessation ( 19-21 ) . Varenicline appear also effective sustained-release bupropion ( 19 ) . Data trial indicate common adverse event attribute varenicline dose 1 mg twice daily nausea ( 19,20 ) . However , efficacy safety varenicline never test diabetic smoker . Therefore , investigator design randomize control study test efficacy safety smoke cessation programme varenicline tartrate 1 mg BID diabetic subject smoke . The investigator hypothesize smoke cessation varenicline could associate similar smoking abstinence rate compare result obtain general population . Given well understanding predictor smoke cessation ( e.g . gender , age smoking initiation , previous quit attempt , Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence ( FTND ) , motivation , depression , anxiety , social/familial environment , etc . ) useful identify potential quitter likely relapsers ( 22 ) little known predictor diabetic , role different predictor abstinence end study also examine . STUDY OBJECTIVES This study intend assess safety efficacy 12 week treatment varenicline smoking cessation . Primary objective : Compare varenicline placebo smoke cessation efficacy 12 week treatment ( i.e . week 24 ) diabetic smoker Co-Primary objective : Compare varenicline placebo smoke cessation efficacy safety 1 week treatment ( i.e . week 13 ) diabetic smoker Secondary objective : 1 ) Compare varenicline placebo smoke cessation efficacy treatment week 52 ; 2 ) Compare varenicline placebo effect weight gain participant successfully quit smoking ; 3 ) Compare diabetic outcome quitter vs relapsers week 24 week 52 ; 4 ) Examine predictor abstinence week 24 week 52 ; 5 ) Summarize safety data 12 week treatment either varenicline placebo . METHODS Study Design The study double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize , clinical trial design assess efficacy safety varenicline 1 mg BID comparison placebo smoke cessation diabetic smoker . The duration active treatment 12 week participant follow nontreatment phase additional 12 week ( 24 week time point ) . This clinical study optional research component prolong follow nontreatment phase full year ( 52 week time point ) . Predictors abstinence end study also examine . Study schedule The subject visit outpatient clinic setting . The flowchart Appendix A B describe procedure complete visit . Screening visit Activities carry screen visit detail Appendix A . At screen visit inclusion/exclusion criterion review . The baseline visit cancel inclusion/exclusion criterion , include laboratory result , meet prior baseline visit . The baseline visit occur less 3 day 2 week screen visit , allow time laboratory result come back . Baseline visit Activities carry baseline visit detail Appendix A. Inclusion/exclusion criterion review . At baseline visit , participant instruct prepare stop smoking set target quit date ( TQD ) , plan coincide Week 1 visit . Also baseline visit , participant randomly assign either varenicline 1 mg BID + counsel match placebo + counseling . Qualified site personnel dispense study drug provide dose instruction . The participant provide approximately . 10 minute counsel , accordance Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) guideline . Diabetic smoker subject usual care throughout study . Week 1 12 visit Subjects return visit clinic baseline visit follow 12 week Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 12 . Subsequent Week 1 Target Quit Date ( TQD-visit ) , visit occur within 3 day schedule visit date . The subject attempt quit target quit date Week 1 visit . The quit attempt occur morning prior clinic visit day , subject 's last cigarette prior quit attempt midnight night prior Week 1 visit . Subjects call 3 day target quit date ( TQD+3 ) remind study participation receive support smoking cessation attempt . These contact longer 5 minute counsel follow AHRQ guideline . Activities carry visit detail Appendix A . At visit , participant provide approximately . 10 minute counsel . Study drug dispense qualified personnel accord plan illustrate Appendix A . Any unused study drug must return clinic visit upon early termination . All subject complete treatment phase 12 week participation . Following completion Week 12 visit , subject continue nontreatment follow-up phase protocol ( see Appendix B ) . Subjects complete Week 12 visit eligible continue . If subject discontinues study drug prior Week 12 visit , subject may continue study participation long complete remain schedule visit Week 12 . Only subject complete week 12 visit eligible continue nontreatment follow-up phase protocol . Nontreatment Follow-up ( Weeks 13 52 ) Subjects return visit clinic Week 24 , Week 36 , Week 44 , Week 52 . Activities carry visit detail Appendix B . Study Population The study enroll approximately 150 subject 2 treatment arm ( active drug match placebo ) , total approximately 300 subject .

SAFETY REPORTING Adverse Events All observe volunteered adverse event , regardless treatment group suspect causal relationship study drug , record . This include symptom think related withdrawal nicotine . Events involve adverse drug reaction , illness onset study , exacerbation pre-existing illness record . Exacerbation disease study ( type 2 diabetes ) , define manifestation ( sign symptom ) illness indicate significant increase severity illness compare severity note start trial . It may include worsen increase severity sign symptom illness , increase frequency sign symptoms intermittent illness , appearance new manifestation/complication . Exacerbation pre-existing illness consider subject require new additional concomitant therapy treatment illness trial . In addition , clinically significant change physical examination finding abnormal objective test finding ( e.g. , laboratory ) also record adverse event . For adverse event , investigator must pursue obtain information adequate determine outcome adverse event ass whether meet criteria classification serious adverse event . For adverse event , sufficient information obtain investigator determine causality adverse event ( i.e. , study drug illness ) . The investigator require assess causality . Serious Adverse Events All serious adverse event ( define ) regardless treatment group suspect relationship study drug must report immediately . A serious adverse event adverse drug experience occur dose : 1 . Results death ; 2 . Is life-threatening ; 3 . Results inpatient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization ; 4 . Results persistent significant disability/incapacity . Any serious adverse event death must report immediately independent circumstance suspect cause occur come attention investigator time study 30 day last administration study drug . Any serious adverse event occur beyond 30 day last administration study drug must promptly report causal relationship study drug suspect . Clinical Laboratory Parameters Abnormal Laboratory Test Results The result laboratory test require protocol record . All clinically important abnormal laboratory test occur study repeat appropriate interval return either baseline level deem acceptable investigator diagnosis explain make . The criterion determine whether abnormal laboratory test result report adverse event follow : 1 . Test result associate accompanying symptom , and/or 2 . Test result require additional diagnostic test medical/surgical intervention , and/or 3 . Test result lead change study dose discontinuation study , significant additional concomitant drug treatment therapy , and/or 4 . Test result lead outcome include definition serious adverse event , and/or 5 . Test result consider adverse event investigator . The following test complete screen baseline visit : blood chemistry ( include sodium , potassium , chloride , BUN , creatinine , glucose , SGOT , SGPT , LDH , alkaline phosphatase , total bilirubin , cholesterol , triglyceride ) complete blood count . In event clinically significant abnormality , urine sample send urinalysis . Moreover , follow additional lab test carry screening , baseline , week 13 , week 24 week 52 ( HbA1c , fast glucose , total cholesterol , HDL , LDL , triglyceride , insulinemia , albumin creatinine ratio , plasma creatinine ) . Abnormal Physical Examination Findings Clinically significant change , judgment investigator , physical examination finding ( abnormality ) record adverse event . DATA ANALYSIS/STATISTICAL METHODS Sample Size Determination The sample size calculation Randomized Clinical Trial , base success quit rate previous smoke cessation study ( 23 ) , indicate 138 subject require 80 % power two-sided 0.05 significance level test detect difference least 20 % quit rate ( 24 week CQR ) treatment group .
