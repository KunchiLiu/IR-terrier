	<detailed_description>Tβ4 promote wound repair regeneration various tissue . In eye , promote corneal epithelial cell migration , decrease inflammation anti-apoptotic activity . It up-regulates gene expression laminin-5 , major subepithelial adhesion protein , locate basement membrane region cornea , conjunctiva , important wound heal . In compassionate-use case , Tβ4 demonstrate efficacy repair non-healing neurotrophic corneal ulcer corneal epithelial wound . In twenty-four nonclinical toxicology safety pharmacology study , safety Tβ4 demonstrate current planned us man . The result two recent dry eye murine mouse model study show Tβ4 reduce corneal stain positive control demonstrate statistically significant reduction stain compare vehicle control . The result study , addition data compassionate use study patient non-healing corneal surface defect , suggest Tβ4 significant potential important new safe effective therapeutic treatment dry eye syndrome .</detailed_description>
