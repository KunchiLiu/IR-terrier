	<brief_title>Ketamine Versus Co-administration Ketamine Propofol Procedural Sedation Pediatric Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedural sedation analgesia ( PSA ) frequent occurrence pediatric emergency department . The goal PSA include maximize analgesia amnesia , minimize adverse event ensure stable cardiopulmonary function . For decade , ketamine main pharmacologic agent use pediatric PSA . Numerous study support use ketamine sedation , amnesia , analgesia child undergo painful procedure emergency department set . Research continually show ketamine cause emergence phenomenon , laryngospasm vomiting . Propofol sedative-hypnotic widely use procedural sedation adult emergency department . The advantage propofol include rapid onset , quick predictable recovery time , antiemetic effect . Disadvantages include dose-dependent hypotension , bradycardia , respiratory depression , well pain injection . In addition , propofol provide analgesia . Ketamine propofol administer together successfully utilized variety setting , include dermatologic , cardiovascular , interventional radiological procedure child . The co-administration ketamine propofol show preserve sedation minimize respective adverse event . When used combination , dose administer reduced , produce stable hemodynamic respiratory profile . Furthermore , combination may reduce frequency emergence reaction , vomit , pain propofol injection . To date , randomize control trial evaluate co-administration ketamine propofol versus ketamine monotherapy PSA Pediatric Emergency Department .</detailed_description>
