	<detailed_description>Inhaled bronchodilator , beta 2 agonist anticholinergic , inhaled corticosteroid mainstay therapy patient diagnose COPD . Anticholinergic bronchodilator long act muscarinic receptor antagonist function block endogenous airway smooth muscle cholinergic tone . Treatment anticholinergic show significantly improve forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , rest dynamic lung hyperinflation , symptom , exercise capacity patient COPD . Currently tiotropium approve long act muscarinic antagonist available treatment COPD.This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study evaluate efficacy safety GSK573719 Inhalation Powder 2 dos administer once-daily via Novel DPI compare placebo treatment period 12 week subject COPD . There total 8 study clinic visit conduct outpatient basis . Subjects meet eligibility criterion Screening ( Visit 1 ) complete 5 9 day run-in period follow 12-week treatment period . There 8 clinic visit three serial spirometry perform . The total duration subject participation study approximately 14 week . This Phase III multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study evaluate efficacy safety GSK573719 Inhalation Powder 62.5 mcg 125 mcg administer once-daily via Novel DPI compare placebo treatment period 12 week subject COPD . Eligible subject randomize 1:1:1 receive either two dos GSK573719 Inhalation Powder dose placebo 12 week . There total 8 study clinic visit conduct outpatient basis . Subjects meet eligibility criterion Screening ( Visit 1 ) complete 5 9 day run-in period follow 12-week treatment period . Clinic visit Screening , Randomization ( Visit 2 ) , Day 3 Weeks 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 1 day Week 12 visit ( Visits 1 8 , respectively ) . A safety follow-up assessment conduct telephone approximately 7 day end study treatment ( FU Phone Contact ) . The total duration subject participation , include follow-up period approximately 14 week . All subject provide albuterol/salbutamol use `` as-needed '' basis throughout run-in treatment period . Pre-dose spirometry conduct clinic visit . Six hour post-dose serial spirometry conduct Visit 2 Visits 5 7 . All subject provide paper diary completion everyday throughout run-in period 12-week treatment period . Subjects use diary record daily use supplemental albuterol/salbutamol record medical problem experience medication use . At Visit 2 Baseline Dyspnea Index ( BDI ) administer . The Transition Dyspnea Index ( TDI ) administer Visits 5 , 6 , 7 . Disease specific health status evaluate use St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) Visit 2 Visits 5 , 6 7 . Vital sign ( blood pressure pulse rate ) , 12-lead ECGs standard clinical laboratory test ( hematology blood biochemistry ) include pharmacokinetic sample obtain select clinic visit . Approximately 198 subject randomized ensure least 168 subject complete treatment period .</detailed_description>
