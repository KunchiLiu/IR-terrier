	<brief_summary>Retrospective study combine positron-emission tomography compute tomography ( PET-CT ) identify adipose tissue high rate uptake 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) active brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) . In addition , biopsy specimen immunohistochemical stain UCP1-specific antiserum use indicate normal adult able BAT . However , study choose subject limited neck tissue . Therefore , investigator intend test BAT different part adult analyse clinical factor .</brief_summary>
