	<brief_title>A Study Low Dose Interferon Alpha Versus Hydroxyurea Treatment Chronic Myeloid Neoplasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic myeloid neoplasm ( CMPN ) consist three main entity , polycythemia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) primary myelofibrosis ( PMF ) . These three disorder many overlap clinical feature . The disease clonal stem cell disorder characterize chronic excess production mainly mature myeloid cell . The excess production clonal red cell ( PV ) , platelet ( PV , ET PMF ) leukocytes ( mainly PV PMF ) lead highly increase risk thrombosis . Patients may also suffer constitutional symptom , pruritus splenomegaly . An inherent feature diseases risk ET PV transformation myelofibrosis risk ET , PV PMF leukemic transformation . In 2005 major breakthrough understand molecular pathophysiology achieve identification JAK2 V617F mutation present almost patient PV ( 98 % ) half patient ET PMF . This somatic gain-of-function point mutation JAK2 tyrosine kinase lead constitutive activation kinase . By mechanism clonal non-growth factor dependent myeloproliferation establish . Traditionally excess platelet white cell production ET , PV PMF treat cytoreductive agent hydroxyurea busulfan order normalize blood count thereby reduce risk thrombosis . However , young patient concern leukemogenic potential agent . In young patient alternative treatment option recombinant pegylated interferon alpha ( IFN-alpha ) , demonstrate high clinical efficacy leukemogenic potential . Within recent year IFN-alpha demonstrate capacity induce deep molecular remission ( evaluate JAK2 V617F qPCR ) normalisation bone marrow morphology . These remission sustain 3 year discontinuation IFN-alpha therapy . Accordingly perspective change natural history disorder towards myelofibrosis ultimately acute leukemia emerge . However toxicity major issue drop-of rate report consistently around 25 % . It well know disease ( e.g multiple sclerosis hepatitis ) patient develop neutralizing antibody IFN-alpha . This issue however scarcely investigate CMPN never test prospective design . The purpose study compare efficacy ( hematological molecular ) toxicity profile two different recombinant interferon alpha product , IFN-alpha2a IFN-alpha2b prospective randomize design . In patient age 60 third study arm hydroxyurea . In order decrease drop rate thereby increase response rate patient start low-dose IFN-alpha . If patient fail respond loos response develop neutralize antibody IFN-alpha therapy stop . If patient sustain deep molecular response ( 1 % JAK2 V617F mutate allele 12 month ) therapy stop ass sustainability remission therapy.Patients age 75 intolerant resistant hydroxyurea offer rescue treatment orally busulfan ( Myleran ) . As important part study quality life investigate .</detailed_description>
