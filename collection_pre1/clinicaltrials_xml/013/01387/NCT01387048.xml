	<brief_title>Study Long-term Treatment Acne Vulgaris With Skinoren Versus Differin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Differin gel , contain adapalene 0.1 % , use several year topical treatment mild moderate acne . It comedolytic anti-inflammatory activity , equally effective less irritant topical retinoids . Adapalene show maintain therapeutic effect achieve three month monotherapy three month . Furthermore , effect maintenance therapy show several study initial combination topical systemic antimicrobial . Skinoren 15 % gel ( azelaic acid ) alternative treatment affect several pathogenetic factor acne , potential maintenance therapy due good tolerability safety miss contraindication concern long-term treatment , allow even use pregnancy . Azelaic acid ( AzA ; HOOC- ( CH2 ) 7-COOH ) naturally occur compound interfere acne pathogenesis virtue antikeratinizing , antibacterial , anti-inflammatory property . Vehicle-controlled study verify AzA exercise significant clinically relevant effect non-inflammatory inflammatory acne lesion . In treatment moderate severe acne , 20 percent AzA cream may favorably combine minocycline ( 90 percent good excellent result ) , may contribute towards reduce recurrence follow discontinuation systemic therapy ( maintenance therapy AzA cream ) . Particular advantage AzA therapy include favorable safety side effect profile . It non-teratogenic , associated systemic adverse event photodynamic reaction , exhibit excellent local tolerability , induce resistance Propionibacterium acne . The 15 % azelaic acid gel recently proven efficacy maintenance treatment papulopustular rosacea combination treatment oral doxycycline . Mild moderate acne vulgaris define global severity 2 4 , accord Investigator´s Static Global Assessment ( ISGA ) Leeds Revised Acne Grading Scale 2 trough 7.This inclusion criterion correspond clinical grade usually treat topical anti-acne therapy . The non-treatment group maintenance phase help demonstrate efficacy Skinoren 15 % gel maintenance treatment , thereby corroborate necessity maintenance therapy reflect acne chronic disease . Acne lesion count use widely evaluation new acne treatment change facial acne lesion count time individual patient could reflect true change . However , lesion count valid great patient population plan study . Therefore , lesion count define secondary efficacy criterion except maintenance phase population treat azelaic acid . As described , microcomedones consider precursor lesion . Moreover , count constantly reduce acne treatment precede clinical relapse . Therefore , microcomedones count use trial marker maintenance therapeutic effect achieve initial treatment phase .</detailed_description>
