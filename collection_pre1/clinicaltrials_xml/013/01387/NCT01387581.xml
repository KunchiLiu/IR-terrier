	<brief_summary>The objective study determine compare performance dermatologist ( Germany ) excision decision performance MelaFind , non-invasive objective multi-spectral computer vision system design tool aid dermatologists detection early melanoma . The hypothesis MelaFind 's sensitivity superior average excision sensitivity dermatologist . Another objective determine compare performance dermatologist ( Germany ) without aid MelaFind . The hypothesis average excision sensitivity dermatologist aid MelaFind superior average excision sensitivity dermatologists without aid MelaFind . A similar study previously conduct dermatologist US ( NCT01011153 ) . An exploratory objective compare excision decision dermatologists previous study ( US ) dermatologists study ( Germany ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Aid MelaFind Affect Clinical Management Decisions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early detection melanoma critical favorable prognosis , since patient earlier stage melanomas much high probability survival later stage . The traditional method early detection serial total body skin exams health care provider examines skin surface , include mucosa , suspicious pigment lesion . The diagnostic performance dermatologist melanoma depend level dermatological training . More important able make diagnosis melanoma clinical impression ability make appropriate decision excise lesion . To aid dermatologist detection early melanoma , MelaFind develop , non-invasive objective multi-spectral computer vision system technology . It design generate output - MelaFind Positive MelaFind Negative- consideration lesion management decision . This survey study determine compare average excision sensitivity melanoma specificity dermatologist ( Germany ) without MelaFind output average excision sensitivity melanoma specificity dermatologist ( Germany ) MelaFind output . Another purpose determine compare sensitivity melanoma specificity MelaFind average excision sensitivity melanoma specificity dermatologist without MelaFind output .</detailed_description>
