	<brief_summary>Previous study show active brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) present adult may play important role material energy metabolism . However , study tumor-based population retrospective study . Due large amount cohort , investigator able promote cross-sectional study incidence factor BAT adult chinese . In addition , investigator analyse metabolic profile healthy adult active BAT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator perform cross sectional analysis chinese adult use 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) scan whole body Huashan Hospital 2009 2013 . BAT activity measure PET/CT . Not demographic data sex , age , medication medical history , also data body composition physical examination collect subject . Imaging date , outdoor temperature fast blood sample collect well . In addition , investigator analyse metabolic profile healthy adult active BAT negative control , lipid profile , fast glucose insulin sensitivity , adipokines biochemical marker .</detailed_description>
