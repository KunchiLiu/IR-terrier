	<brief_title>e- Ab Sensor-based Real-time Detection Oncogenic Human Papilloma Viruses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -induced cervical carcinogenesis propose multi-step nature . The major step cervical carcinogenesis include persistent infection metaplastic cervical epithelium one oncogenic HPV infection , clonal progression infect epithelium cervical precancer , invasion . Although fundamental step well establish , several new genetic immunologic study shed light factor influence transition . Over 150 different HPV subtypes identify far , subset classified high risk oncogenesis . Persistent infection oncogenic HPV main cause cervical cancer . Polymerase-chain-reaction ( PCR ) -based assay show HPV DNA exist around 90.7- 96.6 % patient cervical cancer 13.4 -15.6 % control woman . About detected HPV type patient , descend order frequency , type 16 , 18 , 45 , 31 , 33 , 52 , 58 , 35 . Fifteen HPV type classify high-risk type ( 16 , 18 , 31 , 33 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 56 , 58 , 59 , 68 , 73 , 82 ) ; 3 classify probable high-risk type ( 26 , 53 , 66 ) ; 12 classify low-risk type ( 6 , 11 , 40 , 42 , 43 , 44 , 54 , 61 , 70 , 72 , 81 ) . The frequently detect high risk HPV type ( HPV 16 , 51 , 52 , 59 ) similar male different site , compatible female incidence . Electrosensing antibody probe system ( e- Ab sensor ) , develop rapid sensitive detection hapten , protein , viral antigen medical sample , use analyze interaction kinetics anti-high risk HPV antigen ( high-risk HPV ) present patient . The system incorporate use engineer semiconducive antibody virus vertical lateral chip ( eAbchip ) lateral flow ( eAbsignal ) format . In electrosensing antibody probing , semiconductive antibody bound suitable electrosensing probe , specifically selectively bind targeted molecule ( high-risk HPV ) test specimen . From assessment electric signature semiconductive anti- high-risk HPV antibody , eABprobe could offer sensitive detection precise quantification high-risk HPV . To develop real-time diagnostic technique e- Ab sensor high risk HPV detection , investigator conduct prospective clinical study . In comparison result direct sequence HPV , investigator evaluate performance e- Ab sensor , include reproducibility , sensitivity , specificity , cross-reaction ( detection low risk HPV ) . The potential factor may interfere result would investigate . e- Ab sensor threshold decision must maximize sensitivity . Therefore , threshold value test group find decision could 90 % sensitivity 90 % specificity.With real-time diagnostic technique , investigator hope obtain information patient cost-saving time-saving way give patient early treatment offer individualized treatment patient .</detailed_description>
