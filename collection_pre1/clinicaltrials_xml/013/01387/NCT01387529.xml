	<brief_summary>The objective study establish reference value non-invasive hydration status marker . Although hypothesis associate study , outcome help advance development non-invasive hydration status monitor ( described H08-12 ; A-15208 ) capable detect dehydration single , static measure . The outcome research effort support recognize military community high priority medical technology gap ( MOM ICD v1.3 , 2008 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Disorders fluid electrolyte balance U.S. military result least 125 hospitalization , two lose duty day per event , 9,300 ambulatory hospital visit per year ( 60 % hyponatremia , 40 % dehydration ) ( Carter et al. , 2005 ; DoD , 2008 ) . Diarrhea major infectious disease threat require aggressive i.v . fluid replacement 30 % U.S. troop deploy Iraq Afghanistan ( Brown et al. , 2009 ) . It also important recognize management outcome 662 severe penetrate traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) report military 2009 ( DoD , 2010 ) may hinder dehydration ( Clifton et al. , 2002 ) . Fluid electrolyte imbalance also contribute heat illness ( Carter et al. , 2005 ) substantially impair combat fight effectiveness ( Dupont , 2003 ) . The importance develop valid assessment measure human hydration status clinical field use recognize military community high priority medical technology gap ( MOM ICD v1.3 , 2008 ) . In far forward location ( level I-II ) , orthostatic test gross symptom commonly use estimate hydration status ( Manning et al. , 2007 ) . However , level I-II method share symptoms numerous malady insensitive dehydration severe become debilitate ( Levitt et al. , 1992 ; McGee , 1999 ) . Definitive hydration assessment rear roles medical care ( level III-V ) require invasive serial blood and/or urine measurement ( Feig , 1977 ; Mange , 1997 ) . Thus , field-expedient technology provide accurate , non-invasive assessment hydration status would improve medical triage allow good fluid-electrolyte management medic theatre ( point care ) , medical personnel rear level care ( treatment return duty ) .</detailed_description>
