These obsessive concern compulsive behavior cause significant emotional distress often significantly interfere global functioning . Currently , cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) conjunction psychopharmacology preferred treatment BDD . In addition , two relatively new exposure technique ( `` mirror retrain method '' `` crook mirror externalization therapy '' ) utilize mirror exaggerate patient 's imagined defect appear increase benefit CBT . However , treatment efficacy relatively novel method rigorously test methodologically compare . Although six seven patient treated crook mirror externalization therapy Westwood Institute Anxiety Disorders , Inc. demonstrate significant gain , small sample size allow significant generalization . Thus , goal project : 1 ) determine efficacy exposure therapy utilizes mirror treatment BDD , 2 ) evaluate level effectiveness mirror retrain method versus crook mirror externalization therapy . To accomplish goal , subject take part study follow . They go in-depth interview study physician , Dr. Kagan , complete several clinical assessment questionnaire confirm BDD accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) . They assess study independent evaluator complete several paper-and-pencil test determine severity BDD cognitive difficulty . The subject participate 3 week CBT either mirror retrain method crook mirror externalization therapy . After CBT , repeat clinical assessment questionnaire neurocognitive test . From difference score test , determine change subject 's BDD symptom , , level effectiveness mirror retrain method crook mirror externalization therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Patients With Body Image Issues Treated With 2 Different Behavioral Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Screening : Potential subject call Westwood Institute Anxiety Disorders , Inc. request treatment give detail study train research assistant . Any question potential subject address . If subject interested , invited screen determine whether meet initial criterion study . Potential subject tell information gather screen confidential . If potential subject meet inclusion criterion , decides participate , screen information destroyed . This information pass study physician , Dr. Kagan , contact potential subject make appointment evaluation . Potential subject encourage discus possible participation study physician , therapist , and/or family member . They also encourage write question would like ask study physician upon evaluation . This screening process do part research process . Further Evaluation : After initial telephone screening , potential subject meet principal investigator , Dr. Eda Gorbis , ask subject sign inform consent form ( ICF ) . The research procedures treatment describe detail subject question answer principal investigator . The ICF sign subject principal investigator , agree procedure study consider research , acknowledge participation voluntary , informed risk benefit study . Research procedures include cognitive testing , standardize rating scale , clinical assessment questionnaire discuss . When ICF sign , potential subject meet study physician , Dr. Kagan , comprehensive psychiatric evaluation physical assessment confirm primary diagnosis BDD accord criterion Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition ( DSM-IV ) , identify confound comorbidity , physical health , medication issue may may preclude participation treatment . According subject ' self-report , currently medication BDD must regular prescribe physician continue prescribe medication . Upon confirmation inclusion study , subject give appointment cognitive test clinical assessment study independent evaluator . The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview DSM-IV ( M.I.N.I . ; Sheehan &amp; Lecrubier et al. , 1998 ) use determine comorbid disorder exclude study , take approximately 45 minute complete . The Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale - Third Edition ( WAIS-III ; Wechsler 1997 ) , instrument ass verbal nonverbal intellectual functioning , use determine subject ' cognitive capacity , take approximately 90-120 minute complete . Assessment Instruments : One week prior treatment , subject administer battery clinical rating scale questionnaires determine severity BDD secondary symptom . This assessment battery give immediately follow treatment determine level efficacy two treatment group . These scale include Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Modified BDD ( BDD-YBOCS ) , Body Dysmorphic Disorder Examination-Self Report ( BDDE-SR ) , BDD Diagnostic Module ( BDDDM ) , Y-BOCS Symptom Checklist , Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ) , Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( Ham-D ) , Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HARS ) , Fixity Beliefs Questionnaire , Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) , NIMH Global Obsessive-compulsive Scale , Brown Assessment Beliefs Scale ( BABS ) , Obsessive-Compulsive Inventory ( OCI ) , Obsessive-Compulsive Rating Scale ( OCON ) , Fear Survey Schedule ( FSS ) , Revised Willoughby Questionnaire . These take approximately 90-120 minute complete . Randomization : Following assessment , subject pseudo-randomized either mirror retrain treatment group crook mirror treatment group . Pseudo-randomization mean subject first assign one two group randomly , group membership remixed need assure significant between-group difference pretreatment BDD-YBOCS score . If possible , group also match age gender . Intensive Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy : After subject complete pre-treatment assessment , study therapist meet participant design treatment program . Treatment conduct every day 15 day , Monday Friday , 90-minute session . In addition , part therapy , subject complete homework assignment daily . Intensive CBT BDD do form Exposure Response Prevention ( ERP ) either mirror retrain method crook mirror externalization therapy . This involve prolonged repeat exposure image perceive defect , prevention ritualistic behavior ( e.g. , camouflage cosmetic , skin-picking , etc . ) .</detailed_description>
