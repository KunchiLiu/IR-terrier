Subjects meet eligibility criterion Screening ( Visit 1 ) complete 7 to10 day run-in period follow randomization visit ( Visit 2 ) 24-week treatment period . There total 9 clinic study visit . A follow-up phone contact adverse event assessment conduct approximately one week last study visit ( Visit 9 Early Withdrawal ) . The total duration subject participation study approximately 26 week . The primary measure efficacy clinic visit trough ( pre-bronchodilator pre-dose ) force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) Treatment Day 169 .

	<brief_title>24-week Trial Comparing GSK573719/GW642444 With GSK573719 With Tiotropium Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 24-week , Phase III multicenter , randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , parallel-group study . Eligible subject randomize GSK573719/GW642444 125/25mcg , GSK573719/GW642444 62.5/25mcg , GSK573719 125mcg , tiotropium treatment group 1:1:1:1 ratio . Treatments administer once-daily morning inhalation use Novel Dry Powder Inhaler ( Novel DPI ) HandiHaler . There total 9 study clinic visit conduct outpatient basis . Subjects meet eligibility criterion Screening ( Visit 1 ) complete 7 10 day run-in period follow 24-week treatment period . Clinic visit Screening , Randomization ( Day 1 ) , Day 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24-weeks treatment , 1 day Week 24 Visit ( also refer Treatment Day 169 ) . A follow-up contact adverse assessment conduct telephone approximately 7 day Visit 9 Early Withdrawal Visit . The total duration subject participation , include follow-up approximately 26 week . All subject provide albuterol/salbutamol use `` as-needed '' basis throughout run-in study treatment period . At screen , pre-bronchodilator spirometry test follow post-albuterol/salbutamol spirometry test . Post-albuterol/salbutamol FEV1 FEV1/forced vital capacity ( FVC ) value use determine subject eligibility . To characterize bronchodilator responsiveness , post-ipratropium testing conduct follow completion post-albuterol/salbutamol spirometry . Spirometry conduct post-randomization clinic visit . Six hour post-dose serial spirometry conduct Visits 2 , 6 , 8 . Trough spirometry obtain 23 24 hour previous day 's dose blind study medication Visits 3 9 . All subject provide electronic diary ( eDiary ) completion daily morning even throughout run-in treatment period . Subjects use eDiary record peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) morning , dyspnea score use Shortness Breath Daily Activities instrument ( SOBDA ) , daily use supplemental albuterol/salbutamol either puffs/day metered-dose inhaler ( MDI ) and/or nebule use per day , healthcare contact relate COPD . Additional assessment dyspnea obtain use Baseline Transition Dyspnea Index ( BDI/TDI ) interviewer base instrument . At Visit 2 , severity dyspnea baseline assess use BDI . At subsequent visit ( Visits 4 , 6 , 8 ) change baseline assess use TDI . General health status evaluate use subject-completed EQ-5D questionnaire Visits 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 . Disease specific health status evaluate use subject-completed St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) Visits 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , subject-completed COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) Visits 2 , 6 , 8 . The occurrence adverse event evaluate throughout study begin Visit 2 . SAEs collect time period AEs . However , SAEs assess related study participation ( e.g. , study treatment , protocol-mandated procedure , invasive test , change exist therapy ) relate GSK concomitant medication , record time subject consent participate study include follow contact . Additional safety assessment vital sign ( blood pressure pulse rate ) , 12-lead ECGs standard clinical laboratory test ( hematology chemistry ) obtain select clinic visit .</detailed_description>
