	<brief_summary>Rationale : Proteins release muscle shortly exercise , often refer myokines , may central understand cross-talk exercise skeletal muscle organ , particular liver . So far myokines identify ( e.g . IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-15 , TNF-alpha ) . Taking account role several know myokines develop insulin resistance , reveal new putative myokines might provide valuable information direction future research pathogenesis treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus . Objective : The objective present study identify novel myokines , expression alter skeletal muscle single bout exercise . Study design : experimental study . Study population : Ten healthy , male subject 40 60 year age BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2 , participate study . Intervention : A single exercise bout consist one hour one-legged cycling adapt recumbent cycle ergometer submaximal rate . The non-exercising leg serve control exercise leg . Main study outcome : Main study outcome include upregulation gene skeletal muscle exercise ( focus gene encode myokines ) change blood plasma level select protein exercise .</brief_summary>
