	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give carboplatin , paclitaxel , cetuximab , erlotinib hydrochloride together work treat patient metastatic recurrent squamous cell head neck cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving combination chemotherapy together cetuximab erlotinib hydrochloride may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate erlotinib add combination carboplatin/paclitaxel/cetuximab systemic therapy metastatic/recurrent head neck cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Secondary endpoint toxicity , overall survival , laboratory correlate determine epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal effectively inhibit addition erlotinib chemotherapy/cetuximab without erlotinib . OUTLINE : Patients receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute , paclitaxel IV 1 hour , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
