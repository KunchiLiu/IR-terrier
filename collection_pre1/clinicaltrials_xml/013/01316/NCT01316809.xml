	<brief_summary>Background : - AZD8055 experimental cancer treatment drug work inhibit protein call mTOR , know promote tumor cell blood vessel growth control tumor energy nutrient level . AZD8055 first drug inhibits type mTOR protein expect effective prior mTOR inhibitor . However , research need determine safety effectiveness treat brain tumor know glioma respond standard treatment . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness AZD8055 individual gliomas respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose glioma respond standard chemotherapy , surgery , radiation . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , tumor image study . - Participants separate two treatment group : one group receive surgery remove glioma one surgical treatment . - Participants nonsurgical treatment group take AZD8055 mouth daily 42-day cycle treatment . Participants keep diary record dose keep track side effect . - Participants surgical treatment group take AZD8055 mouth daily 7 day , tumor removal surgery . At least 3 week surgery , participant resume dos AZD8055 continue take drug long tumor recur . - During treatment , participant regular visit clinical center , involve frequent blood urine test examination monitor effect treatment . Participants image study study cancer 's response treatment . - Participants continue cycle treatment long treatment continue effective side effect severe enough stop participation study ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AZD8055 Adults With Recurrent Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Recurrent glioma patient limit treatment option . A significant percentage glioma increase activity PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway , mostly due loss PTEN . - AZD8055 first in-class inhibitor kinase activity mTOR , specifically inhibit mTORC1 mTORC2 complex . Preclinical data generate Neuro-Oncology Branch Laboratory Dr. Howard Fine demonstrate AZD8055 significant anti-glioma activity vivo vitro . Objectives : - To establish maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) continuous daily AZD8055 patient recurrent malignant gliomas enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( EIAED ) . - To generate pharmacokinetic data continuous daily AZD8055 dosing . Eligibility : -Patients histologically proven glioma eligible study . Patients fail prior standard treatment radiotherapy . Design : - This study accrue 24 evaluable patient ( non-surgical arm ) . Cohorts 3 6 patient receive continuous AZD8055 daily orally 42 day . The MTD base tolerability observe first 6 week treatment . Up three patient may enrol simultaneously dose level . The dose AZD8055 progressively escalate 0/3 1/6 patient experience dose limit toxicity prior dose level . - A subset patient tumor re-resection consider standard care receive 1-week treatment AZD8055 undergo resection . Patients treat high dose level show safe time enrollment . Once patient recover surgery , restart treatment AZD8055 stay treatment long tumor progression protocol-mandated removal criterion . Management toxicity non-surgical patient receive second subsequent cycle therapy delineate protocol . Up 12 patient enter surgical arm trial . - The accrual ceiling open 42 patient factor replace come treatment prior cycle 1 . -At end Cycle 1 , patient treatment arm ( surgical non-surgical ) may choose continue receive AZD8055 disease progression experience unmanageable drug relate toxicity , long continue derive clinical benefit fulfill criterion removal protocol therapy .</detailed_description>
