	<brief_summary>Although atherosclerosis systemic disease , manifestation focal eccentric , coronary obstruction progress , regress , remain quiescent independent manner . The focal independent nature atherosclerosis due solely presence systemic risk factor hyperlipidemia , diabetes mellitus , cigarette smoking , hypertension . Local factor create unique local environment major determinant behavior atherosclerosis susceptible individual . The vascular endothelium unique pivotal position respond extremely dynamic force act vessel wall due complex 3-D geometry artery . Mechanical force general , fluid shear stress ( endothelial shear stress [ ESS ] ) particular , elicit large number humoral , metabolic structural response endothelial cell . Regions disturb flow , low oscillatory ESS ( &lt; 1.0 Pa ) , intensely pro-atherogenic , pro-inflammatory , pro-thrombotic , correlate well localization atherosclerotic lesion . These site demonstrate intense accumulation lipid , inflammatory cell , matrix degrade enzyme promote formation high-risk thin-cap fibroatheroma . In contrast , physiologic laminar flow ( 1.0-2.5 Pa ) generally vasoprotective . However , obstruction progress limit blood flow narrow lumen , flow velocity ESS may increase excessively ( &gt; 2.5 Pa ) neck , decrease abnormally outlet , increase likelihood platelet activation thrombus formation . Identification early atherosclerotic plaque likely progress acquire characteristic lead likelihood rupture , consequently , precipitate acute coronary event rapid luminal obstruction , would permit definitive pharmacologic perhaps mechanical intervention prior occurrence cardiac event . The potential clinical value identify `` eradicate '' plaque destine become vulnerable actually become vulnerable enormous . The purpose PREDICTION Trial identify high-risk coronary lesion early time point evolution , follow natural history lesion 6-10 month period , confirm high-risk lesion likely rupture cause acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) develop rapid progression flow-limiting obstruction . The hypothesis local segment coronary artery low ESS excessive expansive remodel site atherosclerotic plaque develop , progress , become high-risk , lead new cardiac event . This study conduct Japan patient clinically evaluate followup coronary angiography IVUS routine manner 6-10 month follow initial percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ACS . This natural history clinical outcome study patient initially present ACS . The natural history portion study design describe temporal progression atherosclerosis segment coronary artery low ESS expansive remodel use intracoronary vascular profile technique utilize intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) coronary angiography . The clinical outcome portion study design evaluate efficacy coronary vascular profile predict segment coronary artery become area rapid plaque growth rupture lead recurrent major clinical coronary event . Five hundred ( 500 ) patient acute coronary syndrome undergo PCI culprit lesion enrol study undergo coronary vascular profile time index catheterization procedure . Up 374 consecutive patient least one low ESS subsegment follow-up coronary angiography IVUS 6-10 month allow least 300 patient analyzable intracoronary vascular profile data assessment lesion natural history . All patient one-year clinical follow-up assess new cardiac event , follow two additional year extend clinical followup .</brief_summary>
