	<brief_summary>Background : - African Americans one high rate type 2 diabetes United States , often medical problem relate obesity cardiovascular disease . These condition various risk factor , include high blood sugar level , high cholesterol level , insulin resistance . However , risk factor study closely individual African ancestry , include Afro-Caribbean sub-Saharan Africa migrant population . Researchers interested conduct genetic study obesity , adult-onset diabetes , heart disease , common health condition individual African ancestry . Objectives : - To collect genetic non-genetic information individual African ancestry study common health condition related obesity , adult-onset diabetes , heart disease . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age self-identify African American , Afro-Caribbean , migrant sub Saharan Africa . Design : - Participants undergo physical examination provide blood sample study . - Participants also answer question personal family medical history current lifestyle behavior . - No treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research protocol design study genetic basis cluster several metabolic disorder include Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) , hypertension , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , obesity , related condition population African Diaspora . This project take advantage well-established infrastructure success Dr. Anne Sumner NIDDK clinical protocol . The project aim enroll subject cohort include white , African Americans Africans live United States goal perform quantitative trait analysis use candidate gene approach understand genetic basis serum lipid level , blood pressure , fast glucose , metabolic parameter . For aim 2 , propose perform whole exome sequence subset case ( n=48 , 96 chromosome ) identify rare common variant multiple metabolic parameter . Variants identify exome sequence effort current sequencing project six candidate lipid gene genotyped entire cohort . Overall , study effort understand black-white difference well difference within black population exist genetic basis T2D , CVD , obesity . Given past activity , also anticipate resource form basis multiple collaboration Dr. Rotimi lab , several NIH intramural researcher , non-NIH scientist .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects include unrelated person selfidentify white African American , AfroCaribbean migrant subSaharan Africa . Adults African ancestry prioritize study paucity genetics study investigate association risk allele contribute prevalence T2D , CVD , obesity common condition population . A small proportion white ( less 10 % ) include study , Dr. Sumner ongoing project ; clinical measurement obtain laboratory serve comparison group . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Children exclude phenotype present commonly adult . Attempts make enroll equal number men woman . No prisoner , pregnant woman fetus include study .</criteria>
