	<brief_summary>The autonomic automatic nervous system help control blood pressure . Diseases autonomic nervous system may result drop blood pressure stand many case lead fainting . Diseases affect autonomic nervous system include pure autonomic failure , multiple system atrophy Parkinson 's disease , present similar symptom sometimes difficult determine exact diagnosis . The purpose study find blood pressure response take single dose medication atomoxetine help diagnosis disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Norepinephrine Transporter Blockade Pathological Biomarker Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational , prospective three-year longitudinal study . The investigator enroll participant primary neurogenic orthostatic hypotension . All participant undergo extensive neurological cardiovascular evaluation , include detailed autonomic testing quality life assessment . The investigator determine magnitude pressor effect produce 18 mg atomoxetine give orally , measure 1 hour drug administration . Participants follow annually often significant change clinical condition . During follow year 3 , investigator repeat initial neurological , cardiovascular autonomic evaluation . The primary endpoint would final diagnosis make year 3 initial evaluation ( end follow-up period ) develop significant worsen symptoms follow-up phone assessment , base specific clinical criterion .</detailed_description>
