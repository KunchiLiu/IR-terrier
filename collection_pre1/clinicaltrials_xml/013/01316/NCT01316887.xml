	<brief_title>A 52-Week , Multicenter , Randomized , Double-Blind , Parallel-Group , Placebo-Controlled Study Evaluate Safety Tolerability GSK573719/GW642444 GSK573719 Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several study demonstrate efficacy safety combine individual LABA compound plus individual LAMA compound COPD . These study show combination two product superior either agent alone variety outcome COPD . The beneficial effect combination regimen likely due different mechanism action two bronchodilator ( smooth bronchial muscle relaxation activation beta2 receptor LABA product inhibition acetylcholine-mediated smooth bronchial muscle contraction via blockade muscarinic receptor LAMA product ) . The availability LABA/LAMA combination one product instead two individual product technical therapeutic advancement pharmacological armamentarium COPD may lead increase patient compliance due once-daily administration . The purpose 52-week study evaluate long-term safety ( term adverse event , COPD exacerbation , laboratory , ECG , Holter finding , vital sign , use rescue medication , lung function ) GSK573719/GW642444 Inhalation Powder 125/25mcg subject COPD . The long-term safety GSK573719 Inhalation Powder 125mcg also evaluate . A placebo arm include evaluate product compare inactive control . All treatment deliver once-daily via nDPI . This study establish long-term safety profile GSK573719/GW642444 Inhalation Powder 125/25mcg once-daily subject COPD . The safety profile GSK573719 Inhalation Powder125mcg once-daily also evaluate .</detailed_description>
