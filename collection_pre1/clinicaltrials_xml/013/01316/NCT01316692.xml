	<brief_title>Aurora A Kinase Inhibitor MLN8237 Treating Patients With Unresectable Stage III-IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate degree clinical benefit base primarily objective clinical response AURKA inhibitor , MLN8237 patient metastatic melanoma phase II , 2-stage trial patient measurable unresectable disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess progression-free survival overall survival patient enrol . II . Define toxicity due MLN8237 characterize severity short prolong duration administration . III . In patient entered stage 1 clinical trial whenever possible pre-treatment biopsy post-treatment surgical specimen , define target inhibition tumor site base : AURKA autophosphorylation ( AURKAThr288/AURKA ) , intra-tumoral drug level , expression p53-induced NOXA PUMA expression , TPX2 , ( IHC ) TUNEL marker apoptosis , cell cycle change ( mitotic index ) , proliferation ( Ki-67 ) , aneuploidy , AKT phosphorylation . IV . All phase II trial patient enrol 2nd stage pre- post-treatment biopsy ( post-day 7+/-3 day ) demonstrate AURKA inhibit base autophosphorylation AURKA/AURKA^Thr 288 , Histone H3 ( S10 ) phosphorylation , AKT phosphorylation , cell cycle change ( mitotic index ) , TPX2 ( IHC ) , proliferation ( Ki-67 ) , aneuploidy , p53-induced NOXA PUMA expression , TUNEL markers apoptosis . V. Demonstrate correlation MLN8237 induce target inhibition tumor sit clinical benefit MLN8237 . VI . Characterize de novo molecular mutational profile melanoma patient enter use develop SNaPshot assay melanoma addition loss regulatory protein ( i.e. , PTEN ) , DNA copy number gene expression ( AURKA ) , autophosphorylation AURKA well AURKA localization IHC . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral Aurora A kinase inhibitor MLN8237 every 12 hour day 1-7 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Stage IIIc IV histologically proven melanoma ( confirm Vanderbilt pathologist ) , curable standard surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy . No available effective therapy ( i.e . ; therapy know curative , ) . Nonbiopsied ( resect ) tumor site must measurable therapy . Patients stage 2 enrollment must tumor site easily biopsied willing undergo pre posttreatment ( around day 8 +/ 3 day ) tumor biopsy . Adequate performance status study , ECOG 01 Adequate baseline organ system function , include 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500 cells/mm3 without growth factor support 2 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0g/dL ( without need transfusion support within 30 day ; growth factor allow ) 3 . Platelet count ≥100,000 cells/mm3 without transfusion growth factor requirement 4 . INR &lt; 1.5 , 5 . Creatinine &lt; 1.5x institutional upper limit normal ( IULN ) , and/or adequate renal function define : Calculated creatinine clearance must ≥ 40 mL/minute ( CockcroftGault ) . 6 . Aspartate alanine aminotransferase &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( IULN ) , bilirubin &lt; 1.5x IULN Female subject either postmenopausal surgically sterilize willing use acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide , abstinence ) duration study 3 month completion study . Male subject agrees use acceptable method contraception duration study 3 month completion study A single regimen prior chemotherapy metastatic melanoma allow . Patients also may receive immunotherapy biologic therapy ( include kinase inhibitor , antibody checkpoint CTLA4 , PD1 , PDL1 , etc . ) metastatic melanoma limit three therapy regimens No prior Aurora kinase inhibitor Completed prior chemotherapy minimum 4 week previously ( 6 week BCNU and/or mitomycin C ) , 4 week prior immune therapy , 6 week antibodies checkpoint CTLA4 , PD1 , PDL1 , etc , 2 week target agent ( i.e . inhibitor MEK , BRAF , Akt , PI3K , mTORC1/2 ) localize radiation therapy . All treatment All treatment related toxicity must resolve grade 2 less baseline level well . Patients receive concomitant radiation therapy enrollment . While protocol limit palliative radiotherapy extend small bone marrow field ( 10 % ) allow . Patients brain metastasis allow systemic corticosteroid stable minimum 8 week . Patients must 18 year age voluntary write informed consent must obtain performance studyrelated procedure part normal medical care , understand consent may withdraw subject time without prejudice future medical care . Subject must able take oral medication maintain fast required MLN8237 administration . Exclusion Criteria Uncontrolled serious infection Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior enrollment New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure , uncontrolled angina , severe uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , electrocardiographic evidence acute ischemia active conduction system abnormality . Prior study entry , ECG abnormality Screening document investigator medically relevant . Patients thromboembolic disease coumadin , low molecular heparin allow . Radiation therapy 25 % bone marrow . Whole pelvic radiation consider 25 % . Prior allogeneic bone marrow organ transplantation . Concurrent therapy cancer . Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 3 year enrollment , exception complete resection basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ malignancy , lowrisk prostate cancer curative therapy . Inability comply protocolspecified procedure ( i.e. , treatment , monitoring , followup ) Female subject pregnant breastfeeding . Confirmation subject pregnant must establish negative serum βhuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) pregnancy test result obtain screening . Pregnancy test require postmenopausal surgically sterilize woman . Patients GI absorptive problem make unlikely absorb study medication likely experience GI toxicity .
