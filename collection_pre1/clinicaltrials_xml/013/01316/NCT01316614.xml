	<brief_title>EUS-guided Fine Needle Aspiration ( FNA ) With Without Use Stylet</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) -guided fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) highly accurate method cytologic diagnosis malignancy routinely perform diagnose stage pancreatobiliary , esophageal , gastric , rectal malignancy subepithelial gastrointestinal lesion . There variation EUS-FNA technique include use suction , area lesion target ( center versus periphery ) , gauge needle , use stylet . The stylet metal wire include needle assembly . The use stylet use purely mechanical purpose , protection safety patient . It think stylet prevents needle become clogged gastrointestinal epithelial cell mucus . To knowledge , compare diagnostic accuracy EUS-FNA stylet accuracy without stylet study . The optimal technique EUS-FNA establish . The report accuracy rate EUS-FNA ( contain heterogeneous sample technique , include without stylet ) 71-98 % pancreatic mass , 90 % lymph node , 67-92 % submucosal gastrointestinal lesion . Typically , FNA perform without stylet use 22 gauge 25 gauge needle similar diagnostic accuracy . When target lesion identify , needle advance gastrointestinal wall lesion ultrasound guidance . If stylet use , remove point . A 10 cc syringe suction place end needle assembly needle move back forth within lesion gather cell . The assembly remove needle content expel onto slide preservative medium . The stylet reinserted needle assembly advance scope another pas . In absence on-site cytopathology , 7 pass without stylet solid lesion 5 pass lymph node without stylet recommend achieve high diagnostic accuracy . EUS-FNA time consuming , mainly stylet need carefully reinserted needle prior pas . Theoretically , use stylet prevents clog needle gastrointestinal epithelial cell mucus affect adequacy specimen . However , data support . As variation practice pattern , endosonographers routinely use stylet . Additionally , perform percutaneous FNA frequently use needle stylet . A recent study suggest use stylet improves diagnostic accuracy percutaneous FNA thyroid lesion . To knowledge , study assess use stylet tissue adequacy EUS-guided FNA . If practice use stylet EUS-guided FNA find yield number adequate tissue sample do without stylet , use stylet would unnecessary . As stylet replacement time consume step FNA , time procedure could shorten significantly stylet require . We propose randomize controlled trial EUS guide FNA without stylet help determine whether use stylet integral obtain adequate tissue aspirate diagnosis solid lesion . To knowledge , prospective , randomized study address effect presence absence stylet specimen adequacy EUS-guided FNA .</detailed_description>
