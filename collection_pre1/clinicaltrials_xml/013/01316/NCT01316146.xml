	<brief_summary>The body different way fight infection disease . No single way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease : antibody T cell . Antibodies proteins protect body disease cause germ toxic substance . They work bind germ substance , stop grow cause bad effect . T cell , also call T lymphocyte , special infection-fighting blood cell kill cell , include tumor cell cell infected germ . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer : show promise , strong enough cure patient . Investigators hope work well together . Investigators find previous research put new gene T cell make recognize cancer cell kill . Investigators want see attach gene T cell help good job recognize kill lymphoma cell . The new gene investigator put T cell make antibody call anti-CD30 . This antibody stick lymphoma cell substance outside cell call CD30 . Anti-CD30 antibody use treat people lymphoma , strong enough cure patient . For study , anti-CD30 antibody change instead float free blood join T cell . When antibody join T cell way , call chimeric receptor . These CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cell seem kill tumor , n't last long chance fight cancer unknown .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>When patient enrolls study , assign dose CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cell . The dose level cell receive base medical determination best patient , instead dose base order patient enrol study relative participant . Subjects enrol earlier study receive low dose cell enrol later study . The risk harm discomfort study treatment may bear relationship dose level . The potential direct benefit , , may also vary dose level . The patient give injection CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cell vein IV line assign dose . The injection take 1-10 minute . Investigators follow subject clinic injection 4 hour . To learn way CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cell work long last body , extra blood drawn . If patient stable disease ( lymphoma grow ) reduction size lymphoma image study T-cell infusion , s/he receive six additional dos T cell 8 12 week interval s/he wish . After T-cell infusion , s/he monitor described .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : PROCUREMENT : Referred patient initially consent procurement blood generation transduce ATL . Eligibility criteria stage include : Diagnosis recurrent CD30+ HL CD30+ NHL , newly diagnose patient unable receive complete standard therapy OR diagnosis relapsed/refractory CD30+ HL CD30+ NHL treatment plan include high dose therapy stem cell transplantation CD30 positive tumor ( result pending time ) Hgb &gt; 8.0 Informed consent explain , understood sign patient/guardian . Patient/guardian give copy inform consent . Karnofsky Lansky score great 60 % TREATMENT : Diagnosis CD30+ HL CD30+ NHL : 1 . During Dose Escalation Phase : adult patient active disease fail standard therapy 2 . After Dose Escalation : patient ( child adult ) newly diagnose , unable receive complete standard therapy OR diagnosis relapsed/refractory CD30+ HL CD30+ NHL treatment plan include high dose therapy autologous stem cell transplantation . ( During dose escalation : adult patient ( age 18 older ; After Dose Escalation : patient ( child age 017 adult ) CD30 positive tumor Bilirubin 1.5 time less upper limit normal . AST 3 time less upper limit normal . Serum creatinine 1.5 time less upper limit normal . Pulse oximetry &gt; 90 % room air Karnofsky Lansky score &gt; 60 % . Available autologous T cell 15 % expression CD30CAR determine flowcytometry . Recovered acute toxic effect prior chemotherapy least one week 30 day prior chemotherapy enter study Adequate pulmonary function FEV1 , FVC DLCO great equal 50 % expect corrected hemoglobin . Sexually active patient must willing utilize one effective birth control method study 6 month study conclude . The male partner use condom . Patients legal guardian must sign informed consent indicate aware research study tell possible benefit toxic side effect . Patients guardian give copy consent form . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : PROCUREMENT : Active infection HIV , HTLV , HBV , HCV ( pending time ) . TREATMENT : Currently receive investigational agent receive tumor vaccine within previous six week . Received antiCD30 antibodybased therapy within previous 4 week . History hypersensitivity reaction murine proteincontaining product . Pregnant lactating .
