	<brief_title>Randomized Comparison Vaginal Self Sampling Human Papillomavirus ( HPV ) Testing Standard Versus Dry Vaginal Swabs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-risk human papillomavirus ( HR-HPV ) infection woman clinically important associate nearly case preinvasive invasive cervical neoplasia1 . Genital HR-HPV related infection common , affect approximately 10-25 % woman , depend population age-groups studied2-4 . With advance understand HPV biology development technology HPV detection together poor sensitivity single Pap test , grow interest concern potential use HPV DNA test screen tool cervical cancer5 . Currently , consensus sample method effective HPV DNA test . These last year , study report sample provide woman suitable DNA test support feasibility self-collection HPV DNA testing6-8 . Data study support acceptable woman demonstrate fairly high concordance rate self- physician test method achieve . Potential advantage self-collection could improve access health care , reduce healthcare cost save time patient provider . Available data report use specimen transport medium ( STM ) , use dry vaginal swab may potentially offer similar reliability standard STM . Small study suggest HPV test ( PCR ) sample physician use dry vaginal swab seem accurate perform standard medium HPV detection9,10 . Dry vaginal swab offer potential advantage term convenient collection less expensive vaginal swab place transport medium . The aim study assess performance self-obtained v-DRY versus `` standard '' v-STM acceptability .</detailed_description>
