	<criteria>Male female ≥ 18 year age . Documented systolic heart failure ejection fraction ( EF ) ≤ 40 % Clinical evidence volume overload Systolic blood pressure ≥ 120 mmHg ≤ 200 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 60 mmHg &lt; 110 mmHg time screen . Stable dos oral medication least 24 hour prior screen No known allergy contraindication furosemide ( Lasix® ) Female patient must postmenopausal surgically sterile . A woman may consider surgically sterilize bilateral tubal ligation ( least 6 month ) , bilateral oophorectomy complete hysterectomy . Be adequately informed nature risk study give write informed consent prior receive study medication . Acute suspect acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) troponin level &gt; 5X upper limit normal institution 's local laboratory accompany dynamic ECG change consistent AMI Clinical diagnosis acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) within 30 day prior screen . Evidence uncorrected volume sodium depletion ( NA ≤ 130 ) condition would predispose patient adverse event . Clinically significant aortic mitral valve stenosis . Temperature &gt; 38°C ( oral equivalent ) , sepsis active infection require IV antimicrobial treatment . ADHF associate significant arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , bradyarrhythmias ventricular rate &lt; 45 beat per minute atrial fibrillation/flutter ventricular response &gt; 160 beat per minute ) . Severe renal failure define creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min estimate CockcroftGault Modification Diet Renal Disease ( MDRD ) equation . Significant pulmonary disease ( history oral daily steroid dependency , history CO2 retention need intubation acute exacerbation , currently receive IV steroid ) . Any organ transplant recipient , currently list ( anticipated next 60 day ) transplant , admit cardiac transplantation . Major surgery within 30 day . Major neurologic event , include cerebrovascular event prior 60 day . Acute myocarditis hypertrophic obstructive , restrictive , constrictive cardiomyopathy ( include restrictive mitral filling pattern ) . Known hepatic impairment Received investigational drug within 30 day prior screen . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Known hypersensitivity allergy natriuretic peptide component , nesiritide , natriuretic peptide related compound . Any condition , opinion Investigator , could interfere , treatment might interfere conduct study , would unacceptably increase risk patient 's participation study .</criteria>
