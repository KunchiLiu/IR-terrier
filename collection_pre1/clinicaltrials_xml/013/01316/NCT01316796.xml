	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic leg ulcer complication many blood disorder sickle cell disease , thalassemia , red blood cell disorder . In disorder , red blood cell break early normal , researcher suspect may cause contribute development leg ulcer ; however , exact cause unknown , current therapy effective . Researchers interested determine research cream make sodium nitrite , substance know increase blood flow dilate blood vessel , may speed heal skin ulcer . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness topical sodium nitrite cream treatment chronic leg ulcer individual sickle cell disease red blood cell disorder . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age sickle cell disease another red cell disorder leg ulcer 4 week . Design : - Participants screen physical examination , medical history , blood test , examination ulcer , include x-ray leg ( ) ulcer swab wound . - Participants schedule 5-day inpatient stay Clinical Center , follow procedure : - Days 1 2 : Participants blood draw , wound assessment , ultrasound affect leg , image study ( magnetic resonance imaging infrared photography ) , thermo-patch application monitor temperature change , measurement blood flow skin , questionnaires pain quality life . An optional skin biopsy may also conduct sample take near skin ulcer - Day 3 : Participants one ulcer treat topical cream . Frequent blood draw conduct application regularly 6 hour application cream . Thirty minute research cream apply , participant image study treat leg measurement pain level blood flow . - Day 4 : Participants blood draw temperature recording take . - Day 5 : Participants research cream apply image study , discharge care home . - For follow 3 week , participant come clinical center twice week research cream apply leg ulcer test perform study researcher . - For fourth final week , participant return additional cream treatment session , image study , blood draw , test direct study researcher . - Study participation end follow week ( week 5 ) . Subjects come final visit one month end study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Leg ulceration long identify serious debilitate complication SCD even first SCD patient describe North America 1910 leg ulceration . The prevalence varies , low 10 year age , genotype SS , influence geographical location , occurrence high 75 percent SS patient Jamaica , 8-10 percent North America . The etiology chronic ulcer SCD hemolytic disorder unknown , mechanical obstruction dense sickled red cell , increase venous pressure , bacterial infection , abnormal autonomic control excessive vasoconstriction dependent position , degree anemia decrease oxygen carry capacity , situ thrombosis , propose potential contributing factor . Recent study report increased incidence leg ulcer patient pulmonary hypertension . Our group pioneer notion association hemolytic phenotype leg ulcer . Current treatment option leg ulceration , include antibiotic , compression bandage , dress change , Unna boot , silver zinc oxide gauze , skin graft maggot therapy rely mostly bacterial containment , stimulation granulation formation decrease venostasis . Pathological change microcirculation associate ulceration address . Nitric oxide metabolism focus branch research past several year . We know mediate essential biological process , include vasodilatation , wound healing , angiogenesis antimicrobial activity . Moreover , NO antiplatelet effect influence several growth factor involve endothelial homeostasis . We propose Phase I study topical cream contain escalate dos sodium nitrite , local donor NO presence heme , novel approach therapy chronic leg ulcer hemolytic disorder . The primary objective evaluate topical sodium nitrite cream safety tolerability patient sickle cell disease hemolytic disorder chronic leg ulcer determine optimal concentration study drug tolerate . Subjects treat Clinical Center 4 week . Potential benefit durable resolution improvement leg ulcer . Possible side effect include hypotension methemoglobinemia , secondary sodium nitrite absorption ulcerate skin . Safety measure use pharmacokinetics analysis sodium nitrite absorption setting obtain . As secondary endpoint , study biology leg ulcer formation patient hemolytic disorder , pathological appearance skin biopsy , role microvascular change formation ( possibly ) resolution . Sophisticated novel study blood flow temperature change sodium nitrite application , well macrovascular appearance MRI allow good understand ulcer formation . This may lead novel approach therapy ulcer hemolytic non-hemolytic disorder , diabetes decubitus ulceration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Each subject must meet follow inclusion criterion screen process order participate study : Subjects must diagnosis sickle cell disease ( SS , SC , Sbetathalassemia ) , hemoglobinopathy , hemolytic disorder , hereditary spherocytosis . Be least 18 year old . Have leg ulcer least 4 week ( 28 day ) duration . Leg ulcer must small 2.5 cm ( 2 ) large 100 cm ( 2 ) . Provide write informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects meet follow criterion baseline evaluation exclude entry study : Exposure therapeutic nitric oxide , Larginine , nitroprusside nitroglycerine within past 1 week . Subjects present clinically diagnose bacterial infection ( e.g. , osteomyelitis , pneumonia , sepsis meningitis ) . Subjects preexist methemoglobinemia ( 2.5 percent ) , unless cytochrome b5 reductase ( methemoglobin reductase ) within normal limit methemoglobin great 3 percent ) Patients currently enrol investigational drug study ( include observational natural history protocol ) . Use PDE5 inhibitor , sildenafil , 4 day prior screen . Pregnant woman ( urine serum HCG plus ) nursing mother . The following list drug agent may cause methemoglobinemia avoid study : Anesthetics ( local ) : Benzocaine , procaine , prilocaine , Anbesol , Orajel Antimalarials : chloroquine , primaquine , quinacrine Aniline dye Chlorates Dapsone Diarylsulfonylureas Doxorubicin Metoclopramide Nitric nitrous oxide Nitrobenzenes ( shoe floor polish paint solvent ) Nitroethane ( artificial nail remover , propellent , fuel additive ) Nitrofurantoin ( furadantin ) Pyridium ( phenazopyridine ) Phenacetin ( acetaminophen ) Phenylhydrazine Rasburicase Sulfonamides ( sulfacetamide , sulfamethoxazole , sulfanilamide , sulfapyridine ) If subject participant meet exclusion criterion participate trial , subject remove study .</criteria>
