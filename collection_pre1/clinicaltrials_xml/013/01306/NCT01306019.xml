	<brief_summary>Background : - X-linked severe combine immunodeficiency ( XSCID ) cause genetic abnormality IL2RG gene affect growth development immune cell white blood cell . Individuals XSCID difficulty fight infection , may lead chronic severe illness death . The primary treatment XSCID replacement patient immune system normal immune system bone marrow transplant . The best outcome transplant patient achieve bone marrow come sibling , parent match unrelated donor provide bone marrow transplant well . However , transplant procedure always effective , researcher study gene transfer treatment approach treat XSCID . - Lentiviral gene transfer treatment use good gene replace defective gene . A lentivirus virus modify carry correct gene blood correct stem cell . By collect individual stem cell modify lentivirus , gene-corrected cell return blood help produce normal healthy immune cell . Gene transfer treatment lentivirus vector use human never study patient XSCID . Objectives : - To determine safety effectiveness lentiviral gene transfer treatment child adolescents X-linked severe combine immunodeficiency . Eligibility : - Children adolescents 2 20 year age XSCID related defect IL2RG gene currently treatment strong immune-modulating chemotherapy drug . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , bone marrow sample collect stem cell procedure . - Participants admit National Institutes Health Clinical Center 11 12 day receive gene-corrected blood stem cell . - Participants receive palifermin 3 day , follow busulfan 2 day . Palifermin help prevent side effect busulfan , busulfan help suppress immune system preparation gene transfer . Participants regular blood test preparation period . - Participants receive transfer correct blood stem cell 36 48 hour second dose busulfan . The cell inject 5 10 minute close monitor . - The day transfer , participant 3 day palifermin . - Participants remain hospital several week , possibly long 6 week , response treatment monitor . - Participants continue monitor immune function possible side effect leave hospital , follow 15 year procedure evaluate long-term effect gene transfer therapy . The monitoring involve regular physical exam blood sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-randomized clinical trial gene transfer use self-inactivating , insulated , lentiviral gene transfer vector treat 13 patient X-linked severe combine immunodeficiency ( XSCID , also call SCID-X1 ) 2 40 year age ; tissue match sibling donate bone marrow transplant ; may fail obtain sufficient benefit previous half-tissue match bone marrow transplant ; clinically significant impairment immunity . A patient precursor cell ( also call blood stem cell ) give rise marrow blood immune cell collect patient blood bone marrow . A patient proceed gene transfer treatment protocol least 3 million blood stem cell per kilogram body weight collected patient . At NIH patient blood stem cell collect either blood bone marrow another protocol ( NIH protocol 94-1-0073 successor approve protocol ) specific collection cell . In case harvest blood stem cell put frozen storage use protocol . When patient enrol protocol require number blood stem cell harvest , patient blood stem cell grown tissue culture expose lentiviral gene transfer vector contain corrective gene . These gene correct blood stem cell administer vein patient . To increase engraftment correct blood stem cell , patient receive 2 day gene transfer treatment chemotherapy drug call busulfan total dose 6 mg/kilogram body weight ( 3 mg/kilogram body weight/daily time 2 day ) little one-third dose use many standard bone marrow transplant . Patients also give another drug call palifermin help prevent main side effect busulfan type inflammation mouth , stomach bowel call mucositis . After treatment , patient monitor see treatment safe whether immune system improve . Patients follow frequent interval first 2 year , less frequently thereafter effectiveness restoration immune function safety treatment evaluate . XSCID genetic disease cause defect common gamma chain , protein find surface immune cell call lymphocyte necessary growth function . XSCID patient make T-lymphocytes necessary fight infection , B-cells fail make essential antibody . Without normal T- B-lymphocyte function patient develop fatal infection infancy unless rescue bone marrow transplant healthy donor . The best type transplant tissue match healthy brother sister , XSCID patient tissue match sibling , treat transplant parent half-matched tissue type . While half-matched transplant parent life-saving infant XSCID , subset patient fail achieve sufficient long lasting restoration immunity prevent infection chronic problem . Recent trial gene transfer treatment use mouse retrovirus vector infant XSCID perform demonstrate type gene transfer alternate approach significantly restore immunity infant XSCID . However , among 18 infant XSCID benefit long term gene transfer treatment , 5 develop T-lymphocyte leukemia 1 die leukemia . Furthermore , old child XSCID treat gene transfer , restoration immunity much less see infant . These observation gene transfer treatment use mouse retrovirus vector treat infant old patient XSCID suggest safer effective vector need , also may need give chemotherapy condition increase engraftment marrow gene correct blood stem cell . Our data publish study suggest lentivectors derive human immunodeficiency virus property highly modify vector call CL20-4i-EF1alpha- HgammaC-OPT reduce interaction nearby gene therefore less tendency activate gene may lead cancer formation . Also , type lentivector may work well get blood stem cell . The study purpose evaluate safety effectiveness lentiviral gene transfer treatment restore immune function 13 XSCID patient 2 40 year age , significant impairment immunity . Early evidence effectiveness define appearance expansion circulation patient gene correct T-lymphocytes functional gammac gene improve laboratory measure immune function . The primary endpoint efficacy 2 year treatment , include laboratory parameter plus evidence clinical benefit . Evidence safety focus maintenance diversity gene mark cell occurrence abnormal pattern production blood cell leukemia cancer . The primary study endpoint laboratory clinical measure efficacy safety occur 2 year gene transfer treatment . However , data collection regard efficacy occur frequent interval 2 year lead endpoint analysis , long term safety efficacy evaluation continue interval long term follow-up require regulation gene transfer treatment study .</detailed_description>
