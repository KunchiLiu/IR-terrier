	<brief_summary>Background : - The current standard care advanced lung cancer cancer thymus consist primarily chemotherapy treatment . The drug use chemotherapy depend classification cancer different category base appearance cancer microscope . Though approach prove useful way , survival rate individual lung cancer cancer thymus still poor . Recent research show several genetic abnormality play important role development growth lung cancer cancer thymus , possible improve treatment success rate drug specifically target abnormal gene . Researchers interested determine whether possible analyze gene patient lung cancer cancer thymus order provide personalize treatment drug target specific gene abnormality . Objectives : - To evaluate effectiveness genetic analysis determining target therapy individual advance non-small cell lung cancer , small cell lung cancer , thymic cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose either lung cancer cancer thymus consider curable use surgery radiation therapy . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , blood urine test , tumor image study . Participants tumor biopsy provide previously collect tumor tissue study . - Based result tumor biopsy study , participant separate different treatment group : - Participants EGFR gene mutation receive drug call erlotinib , inhibit protein call EGFR think key factor development progression cancer . - Participants KRAS , BRAF , HRAS , NRAF gene mutation receive drug call AZD6244 , inhibit protein call MEK think key factor development progression cancer . - Participants PIK3CA , AKT , PTEN gene mutation receive drug call MK-2206 , inhibit protein call AKT think key factor development progression cancer . - Participants KIT PDGFRA gene mutation receive drug call sunitinib , inhibit protein think key factor development progression cancer , include kidney cancer . - Participants ERBB2 gene mutation amplification receive drug call lapatinib , inhibit protein think key factor development progression cancer , include breast cancer . - Participants genetic abnormality describe offer different option treatment , include standard care chemotherapy treatment investigational agent different research protocol . - After 6 week treatment , participant image study evaluate status cancer . Treatment continue long participant tolerate drug disease progress . - Participants benefit first treatment eventually develop resistance progression cancer offer chance second tumor biopsy undergo different treatment cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - A good understanding genetic make-up individual tumor may offer potentially improved therapy . This approach may also give rapid access response data patient sometimes rare genetic abnormality . - In addition , allow u test target therapy select population patient likely favorable response base molecular profile specific mechanism action drug test . - This approach also speed drug development potentially approval , rescue otherwise ineffective drug candidate specific subgroup benefit . Primary Objectives : - To determine feasibility use tumor molecular profiling targeted therapy treatment advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) thymic malignancy . - To estimate response rate molecular-profile direct treatment NSCLC , SCLC thymic malignancy patient . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients histologically confirm advanced lung cancer thymic malignancy surgical resection curative intent feasible . - Patients must either biopsiable disease willing undergo biopsy molecular profiling paraffin embed tissue block suitable molecular profiling analysis . - Individuals eligible EGFR germline mutation testing : - personal history invasive lung cancer one pre-invasive histology associate development lung cancer two affect family DESIGN : - All patient tumor undergo molecular profiling . Based result eligibility criterion , patient offer enrollment different target therapy arm . - At NCI site , individual eligible EGFR germline mutation undergo test germline mutation affect EGFR gene ; mutation detect , first-degree relative would invite undergo test index germline mutation find proband appropriate follow-up trial . - Effective Amendment I , participate site , OHSU , discontinue new enrollment data entry exist patient NOS arm protocol favor OHSU protocol L8639 , Personalized Cancer Medicine Registry . The data patient include data 11-C-0096 ( 8639 ) NCI patient time publication . Any OHSU patient eligible treatment arm continue enrol follow per protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR INITIAL ENROLLMENT : Patients histologically confirm advanced NSCLC , SCLC thymic malignancy surgical resection multimodality therapy curative intent feasible . For patient Stage III NSCLC , encompass radiation port , definitive XRT perform first possible . Individuals meet eligibility criterion EGFR germline mutation test advanced cancer define 3.1.1 may enroll EGFR germline mutation test eligible treatment NOS arm . Patients advanced cancer must meet one follow criterion ( apply firstdegree relative individual preinvasive histology enrol EGFR germline mutation test ) : Patients must biopsiable disease willing undergo biopsy molecular profiling OR Patients must enough adequate archival material previous biopsy perform molecular profiling analysis . The adequacy material provide determined principal investigator conjunction laboratory perform molecular profiling analysis OR Patients must previously undergo successful molecular profile tumor mutation analysis gene describe section 5.2 , part protocol ( crossover patient ) molecular profiling protocol Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium protocol among others . Age great equal to18 year . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients major surgery , chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 2 week earlier . 2 . Patients may receive investigational agent medication treatment malignancy . 3 . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . However , patient treatment brain metastasis whose brain metastatic disease status remain stable least 1 week end brain radiation may enrol undergo molecular profile discretion principal investigator . In addition , brain metastatic disease stable least 4 week , patient enrol experimental treatment arm . 4 . Patients condition ( e.g. , gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease ) impair ability swallow retain tablet exclude . 5 . Any uncontrolled medical illness precludes patient undergoing biopsy molecular profiling / receive treatment one experimental arm study exclude . These condition include limited : Ongoing uncontrolled , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( Class III IV define NYHA functional classification system ( see Appendix D ) . Uncontrolled hypertension Unstable angina pectoris Cardiac arrhythmia Uncontrolled diabetes Uncontrolled psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 6 . Patients QTc prolongation ( define QTc interval equal great 500 msec ) significant ECG abnormality exclude . 7 . Caution use patient require use concomitant medication prolong QT interval effort make switch different medication patient begin treatment experimental arm . See Appendix E table medication potential prolong QTc interval . A comprehensive list agent potential cause QTc prolongation find : http : //www.azcert.org/medicalpros/druglists/bycategory.cfm 8 . The eligibility patient take medication potent inducer inhibitor enzyme determine follow review case Principal Investigator . ( A list potent CYP3A4 inducer inhibitor find Appendix F ) . Every effort make switch patient take agent substance medication begin treatment one experimental drug include protocol , particularly patient gliomas brain metastasis take enzymeinducing anticonvulsant agent . A comprehensive list medication substance know potential alter pharmacokinetics sunitinib CYP3A4 provide Appendix F. 9 . Patients tumor amenable potentially curative therapy assess investigator . 10 . Pregnant woman exclude study many FDA approve agent investigational agent trial potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother agent , breastfeed discontinue mother treat protocol . These potential risk may also apply agent use study .</criteria>
