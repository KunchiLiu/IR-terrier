	<brief_summary>The hypothesis present study Freeman-Sheldon syndrome ( FSS ) relate condition : ( 1 ) exercise capacity lower FSS patient versus normal control , low exercise capacity due change muscle ' normal structure inability sufficient quantity energy molecule bind muscle ; ( 2 ) muscle problem reduce amount air get lung amount oxygen carry blood , effect increase heart respiration rate , blood pressure , deep body temperature , produce muscle rigidity ; ( 3 ) event note , occur cardiac stress testing , relate problem similar malignant hyperthermia ( MH ) report muscle disorder without use drug know cause MH . MH ( life-threatening metabolic reaction classically trigger susceptible person receive certain drug use anaesthesia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study research project initiate graduate research student ( Mikaela I. Poling ) assist clinical genetics fellow graduate student ( Andr√©s Morales ) partial fulfilment requirement Masters degrees Clinical Applied Physiology , approval , direction , supervision study PI ( Rodger J. McCormick ) . Importance Present Study : FSS rare human neuromusculoskeletal disorder present birth , involve primarily limb craniofacial deformity . There prospective study address physiological parameter , necessary enable understand underlying pathology pathophysiology Freeman-Sheldon syndrome . Elucidating deviation baseline stress physiological parameter FSS patient versus standard normal value normal control subject critical importance tailor therapeutic intervention challenge patient population . Background : Vanek et al . ( 1986 ) purpose FSS spectrum non-progressive congenital myopathy , give pathological electromyographical ( EMG ) evidence . They find white fibrose tissue within histologically normal muscle fibre , result abnormal EMGs . Toydemir et al . ( 2006 ) show mutation embryonic myosin heavy chain 3 ( MYH3 ) , cause classic FSS phenotype , screen 28 probands . In 20 patient , new missense mutation cause substitution arginine position 672 ( arg672 ) histidine cytosine ; arg672 find myosin protein post-embryonically . Of remain six patient mutation find , three new missense familial mutation ; three patient sporadic expression new , also find Sheldon-Hall syndrome ( SHS ) ; two patient recognize mutation . They postulate allelic variation arg672 could affect adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) binding . It unknown mutation might correlate phenotype observe . Their laboratory , include Stevenson et al . ( 2006 ) also present strong evidence FSS SHS similar distal arthrogryposes ( DA ) distinct entity base phenotype , natural history , genotype . Portillo et al . ( unpublished data ) , study biopsy patient , find evidence muscle superior orbicularis oculus find highly variable fibre size single pathological feature single vastus lateralis biopsy . Clinically , patient , to-date severe expression FSS , exhibit function superior eyelid reasonable muscle tone , bulk , strength thigh . These finding suggest variable syndromic affectation body region . They report exertional dyspnea rest tachycardia , without pathological feature , patient anecdotal information concern exertional dyspnea two adult FSS patient . They also document occurrence unexplained , seemingly stress-induced , episodic fever patient resemble malignant hyperthermia ( MH ) clinical triad hyperthermia , tachycardia , muscle rigidity . In addition age , gender , physical activity status , concomitant disease disability , maximal oxygen uptake , function exercise capacity , genetically-controlled , already document muscle disorder , idiopathic febrile episode report Portillo et al . may share physiological biochemical similarity well-defined congenital muscle anomaly MH , classically occur susceptible individual receive inhale anaesthetic , ether halothane , depolarize muscle relaxant surgery . Together , clinical observation suggest may syndromic relationship exercise capacity development MH-like febrile syndrome , important demonstrate finding control experimental setting . Significant difference among similar distal arthrogryposes ( DAs ) may exist , respect , important define experimentally , well . Data concern baseline stress physiology FSS similar DAs could help define distinct DA phenotype clinically similar FSS , contribute nosological classification FSS related entity . This study include FSS , Sheldon-Hall syndrome , DA type 1 , DA type 3 .</detailed_description>
