	<brief_title>Study Contraceptive Efficacy Safety Amphora Gel Compared Conceptrol Vaginal Gel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical Trial Design This multicenter , open-label , randomize , control , Phase III study repeat use Amphora™ gel compare Conceptrol® Vaginal Gel method contraception seven cycle use . In addition , opportunity Amphora™ gel subject continue study treatment 13 cycle treatment upon completion first seven cycle treatment . A subset subject ( Amphora™ gel Conceptrol® Vaginal Gel ) undergo colposcopy Admission Visit visit Cycles 1 , 3 , 7 ( Treatment Exit ) . Subjects participate 13 cycle also undergo colposcopy Cycles 10 13 . Colposcopic photograph take visit independent presence suspicious area . Any suspicious area clinical finding record colposcopy case report form . The colposcopy evaluator subset blind regard treatment group subject . If time study investigator deem colposcopy necessary , colposcopy perform subject limited subject colposcopy subset . A subset subject ( Amphora™ gel Conceptrol® Vaginal Gel ) also semi-quantitative culture E. coli clinical yeast perform Admission Visit Cycles 1 , 3 , 7 ( Treatment Exit ) Visits . Subjects participate 13 cycle also undergo assessment Cycles 10 13 . Another subgroup quantitative vaginal culture perform Cycles 1 7 ( Treatment Exit ) Visits , also Cycle 13 subject participate extension . Selected research center also recruit subject subset woman 36-45 year age enrollment .</detailed_description>
