	<brief_summary>Background : Sorafenib drug approve treat kidney liver cancer ( hepatocellular carcinoma , HCC ) show prolong survival patient HCC . It work slow spread cancer cell , fully prevent cancer grow . Researchers interested combine sorafenib experimental drug TRC105 , design block growth blood vessel lead tumor growth , order determine whether drug combination stop tumor growth reduce tumor size well sorafenib alone . Objectives : To determine safety effectiveness combination sorafenib TRC105 treatment hepatocellular cancer respond treatment . Eligibility : Individuals least 18 year age diagnose hepatocellular cancer respond treatment , consider candidate liver transplantation . Patients receive anticoagulant therapy exception low dose aspirin . No history bleed problem peptic ulcer disease . Design : Participants screen full medical history physical examination , blood urine test , tumor image study . Participants tumor biopsy provide previously collect tumor tissue study . An examination esophagus look problem blood vessel complete patient history cirrhosis . Participants receive sorafenib tablet twice every day , morning night , full glass water . Participants receive TRC 105 infusion every two week day 1 15 28 day cycle . At visit first cycle , participant physical examination blood test . Participants continue blood test urine test every cycle monitor effect treatment , include test kidney function . Participants image study every two cycle evaluate result treatment , may also provide tumor sample study . Treatment continue long tumor grow side effect remain tolerable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib TRC105 Hepatocellular Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Worldwide , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common malignancy median survival 6-9 month . The SHARP study establish sorafenib standard consideration disease set bar future study systemic therapy . - TRC105 chimeric anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody bind CD105 , transmembrane receptor selectively express proliferate endothelial cell . TRC105 bind CD105-expressing endothelial cell mediate growth inhibition , apoptosis antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) . Objectives : Primary : - Phase I : To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) TRC105 give standard-dose sorafenib HCC . - Phase II : To determine estimate response rate accord RECIST criterion combination TRC105 sorafenib HCC . Eligibility : - Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis HCC . - Childs-Pugh A B ( 7 point ) cirrhosis allow . - Patients must disease amenable potentially curative resection , radiofrequency ablation , liver transplantation . - In phase I , prior systemic therapy allow . - In phase II , prior systemic therapy HCC ( include sorafenib ) allow . - No history bleed varix previous 1 year ( unless subsequent liver transplant ) . - No anti-coagulation ( except low-dose aspirin ) . Design : - TRC105 administer intravenously every two week , day 1 15 28 day cycle . Sorafenib self-administered twice daily mouth . - Phase 1 : The first part study standard 3+3 dose escalation phase I study primary objective establish MTD TRC105 give combination standard-dose sorafenib . Sorafenib take orally dose 400 mg twice daily . TRC105 administer intravenous infusion every two week . Patients restaged include image study assess response progression every 8 week . The TRC105 dose escalate cohort 3 6 patient maximum 15 mg/kg every two week . Intra-patient dose escalation allow . - Phase II : TRC105 administer intravenous infusion every two week recommend phase II dose , 15 mg/kg TRC105 ever two week combination standard dose sorafenib , define phase I . The sample size interim stopping rule determine use Simon optimal two-stage design . The first stage initially enroll 6 evaluable patient , 0 6 clinical response , patient accrue . If 1 first 6 patient clinical response , accrual would continue total 23 patient enrol . As may take several week determine patient experience response , temporary pause accrual may necessary ensure enrollment second stage warrant . If 1 2 clinical response 23 patient , would uninterestingly low response rate . If 3 complete response 23 patient ( 13.0 % ) , would sufficiently interest warrant study late trial . Under null hypothesis ( 5 % response rate ) , probability early termination 73.5 % . Cohort : -0 ; Sorafenib ( mg PO twice daily ) : 400 bid ; TRC105 ( mg/kg IV weekly ) : 1 Cohort : 1 ; Sorafenib ( mg PO twice daily ) : 400 bid ; TRC105 ( mg/kg IV weekly ) : 3 Cohort : 2 ; Sorafenib ( mg PO twice daily ) : 400 bid ; TRC105 ( mg/kg IV weekly ) : 6 Cohort : 3 ; Sorafenib ( mg PO twice daily ) : 400 bid ; TRC105 ( mg/kg IV weekly ) : 10 Cohort : 4 ; Sorafenib ( mg PO twice daily ) : 400 bid ; TRC105 ( mg/kg IV weekly ) : 15</detailed_description>
