	<brief_title>Influenza Vaccination HIV Infected Pregnant Women : Safety Immunogenicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Determining contribution influenza early childhood morbidity mortality sub-Saharan Africa potential prevent influenza disease vaccination may contribute reduce childhood death ; since influenza illness vaccine preventable disease vaccine develop , license available reasonable cost . Unfortunately , infant high risk serious disease 6 month age , trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) poorly immunogenic license . As pregnant woman also increase risk serious illness ( 3.3-5.5 fold hospitalization influenza-associated acute cardio-respiratory illness ) influenza infection , one strategy prevent complication influenza pregnant woman young infant maternal TIV immunization , recommend WHO . This could result direct protection woman protection young infant consequent transplacental transfer TIV induce antibody . Barriers administration vaccine pregnancy include lack information effectiveness concern safety probably explain virtual non-existent use TIV pregnant woman low-middle income country , include South Africa . The immunogenicity efficacy TIV HIV-infected adult recently document African setting . A placebo-controlled , community-based randomize , placebo control trial , conduct South Africa report TIV associate 75 % reduction influenza-confirmed illness . The result study also confirm safety TIV among African HIV-infected adult . The study , however , include 7 woman pregnant . In addition difference solicit adverse event rate , also difference either CD4+ cell count change HIV viral control antiretroviral treatment TIV vaccinee compare placebo recipient . This allayed previous concern regard potential negative effect TIV center around observed transient increase HIV-1 viral load , even HIV infect individual ART virologically suppress ( viral load &lt; 400 copies/ml ) . Decreases CD4+ lymphocyte count also observe HIV-infected individual post TIV vaccination . These change , however , even past study infrequent ( 4-18 % ) resolve later time-points consider clinically non-significant . Only recently data become available Bangladesh benefit maternal TIV vaccination demonstrate 63 % ( 95 % CI 5 85 ) reduction laboratory-confirmed influenza illness infant 24 week age child bear mother vaccinate TIV 36 % reduction clinical illness vaccinate mother . There , however , study effectiveness maternal immunization TIV influenza- associate morbidity mortality either mother infant African setting . Despite encouraging result maternal immunization Bangladesh , preliminary data support TIV efficacious mainly HIV-infected non-pregnant adult , data need advocate routine use TIV pregnancy setting high prevalence HIV . Reasons include impact maternal HIV kinetics TIV induce transplacental antibody transfer derive available data . This important primary focus proposal , major potential public health benefit maternal TIV vaccination , target protection young infant . HIV infection know decrease placental integrity lower antibody level fetus newborn . Furthermore , maternal hypergamma-globulinemia characteristic HIV-infection may associate decreased neonatal antibody level . This paradox explain limited number placental antibody receptor , result IgG antibody compete available receptor thereby decrease vaccine-specific antibody transport . Preterm birth increase HIV , chronic maternal disease malnutrition . Transfer maternal antibody gestational age dependant , may affect maternal immunization sub-Saharan Africa condition common . The overall aim project evaluate safety immunogenicity TIV vaccination HIV-infected pregnant woman</detailed_description>
