	<brief_summary>Background : - Viral infection important cause illness death hospitalize patient well outpatient . New strain virus may appear infect healthy people weak immune system . A good understanding new virus strain may help control prevent infection . In particular , viral infection less problematic healthy person life threaten person weak immune system , virus may able evolve rapidly person weak immune system therefore develop resistance exist treatment . Researchers interested collect sample information otherwise healthy person person weak immune system study effect viruses development . Objectives : - To collect sample data individual expose contracted viral infection . Eligibility : - Individuals age diagnose viral infection suspect viral infection , close contact someone suspect actual viral infection interest investigator Laboratory Infectious Diseases . - Healthy person person weak immune system ( immunocompromised individual ) eligible participate . Design : - Participants initially screen review medical record eligible history physical performed . - Study procedure may include blood , stool , urine , saliva , nasal fluid sample , throat genital swab . For participant specialized sample collection procedure part medical care ( e.g. , spinal tap , bronchoscopy , liver biopsy ) , researcher may collect leftover sample clinical laboratory test . - Samples may collect four time per week first 2 week enrollment study , many two time per week 1 year . The number study visit determine study researcher , depend virus study . Some participant may ask continue provide sample longer 1 year concern recurrence relapse infection study researcher feel reason would important follow viral infection . - For otherwise healthy person expose viral infection , initial specimen collect three additional specimen may collect 1 year . - Treatment offer study ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Viral infection important cause morbidity mortality hospitalize patient well out-patients . New strain virus may appear cause epidemic healthy person immunocompromised person . A good understanding new virus strain may help control prevent infection . Some viral infection would otherwise asymptomatic cause mild disease life threaten immunocompromised person . Immunocompromised person often shed high titer virus prolong period time . In absence potent immune system , virus may evolve rapidly host . Therefore , analysis sequential virus specimens patient provide information virus evolution , include resistance antiviral agent develop . In addition , high titer virus may associate virus mutant adapt grow cell culture . In protocol obtain specimen contain virus otherwise healthy immunocompromised patient sequential period time study nucleic acid sequence , sensitivity antiviral agent , ability grow cell culture . We also record patient sign symptom , note result pertinent laboratory work-up , case , obtain blood measure immune response look viremia . This study provide understand virus evolve natural host , become resistant antiviral agent , antibody response evolve virus , might allow currently uncultivatable virus grow cell culture .</detailed_description>
