	<brief_summary>Background : - The experimental cancer treatment drug ABT-888 ( Veliparib ) work prevent deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair tumor cell . Cyclophosphamide cancer treatment drug work cause DNA damage cell , include cancer cell , result cell death . However , cyclophosphamide strong unpleasant side effect , researcher interest find drug give combination cyclophosphamide allow low dose cyclophosphamide give similar effect . The combination ABT-88 cyclophosphamide may effective treatment type cancer , certain kind breast ovarian cancer non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma often respond standard therapy . Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness ABT-888 cyclophosphamide ovarian breast cancer non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose ( 1 ) ( Breast cancer 1/2 ) BRCA1/2 ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal ovarian high-grade carcinoma , fallopian tube cancer ; ( 2 ) triple-negative breast cancer ( responsive hormone-related therapy ) ; ( 3 ) low grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , blood urine test , tumor image study . Participants divide two group different treatment subgroup . - Group 1 : Participants BRCA-positive ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma , fallopian tube cancer - Participants receive either combination ABT-888 cyclophosphamide , cyclophosphamide alone . - Participants take study drug mouth day 21-day cycle treatment , keep diary record drug dos side effect . - Participants clinic visit blood urine test , image study , examination day 1 , 2 , 7 , 14 cycle 1 , first day cycle . - Group 2 : Participants triple-negative breast cancer non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma - Participants receive either combination ABT-888 cyclophosphamide , cyclophosphamide alone . - Participants take study drug mouth day 21-day cycle treatment , keep diary record drug dos side effect . - Participants clinic visit blood urine test , image study , examination day 1 , 2 , 7 , 14 cycle 1 , first day cycle . - Participants receive cyclophosphamide show sign disease progression tumor image study receive combination ABT-888 cyclophosphamide . - Treatment continue long participant tolerate drug disease progress .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II ABT-888 With Cyclophosphamide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - The poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) family enzymes critical maintain genomic stability regulate variety DNA repair mechanism . - Individuals deleterious mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene increase risk develop breast ovarian cancer due impair defective DNA damage repair ; individual increase susceptibility DNA-damaging agent PARP inhibitor . Inhibition PARP inhibit repair DNA damage cause alkylating agent cyclophosphamide . - Metronomic cyclophosphamide demonstrate efficacy several tumor type . The PARP inhibitor ABT-888 show potentiate action cyclophosphamide xenograft model . This combination well tolerated Phase I study show promising activity . Objectives : - Compare response rate ( complete response ( CR ) + partial response ( PR ) ) combination ABT-888 metronomic oral cyclophosphamide response rate ( CR+PR ) metronomic oral cyclophosphamide patient deleterious BRCA mutation refractory ovarian cancer patient primary peritoneal ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma fallopian tube cancer . - Compare response rate ( CR+PR ) combination ABT-888 metronomic oral cyclophosphamide response rate ( CR+PR ) single-agent oral cyclophosphamide patient triple-negative metastatic breast cancer , stratify deleterious BRCA mutation . - Compare response rate ( CR+PR ) combination ABT-888 metronomic oral cyclophosphamide response rate ( CR+PR ) single-agent metronomic oral cyclophosphamide patient refractory low-grade lymphoma . Secondary Objectives : - Determine PAR level tumor biopsy , evaluate archival tissue whether patient tumor mutation gene involve DNA damage repair ( e.g. , BRCA/Fanconi anemia/protein 53 ( p53 ) ) , perform exploratory gene expression profile correlate PARP messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) level BRCA mutation status response therapy , count circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) , determine H2AX level CTCs tumor biopsy ( National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) clinical center ) . Eligibility : -Adults refractory BRCA-positive ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma , fallopian tube cancer , triple-negative breast cancer , low-grade lymphoid malignancy ( non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ) whose disease progress follow least one line therapy . Study Design : - This randomize , multi-histology Phase II trial patient enrol 3 cohort : BRCA-positive ovarian cancer primary peritoneal ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma fallopian tube cancer ( A ) ; triple-negative breast cancer ( B ) ; low grade non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( C ) . Patients cohort A randomized combination ABT-888 metronomic oral cyclophosphamide metronomic oral cyclophosphamide alone . Patients cohort B randomize combination ABT-888 metronomic oral cyclophosphamide metronomic oral cyclophosphamide alone . Patients cohort C randomize combination ABT-888 metronomic oral cyclophosphamide metronomic oral cyclophosphamide alone . - Cyclophosphamide ( 50 mg ) ABT-888 ( 60 mg ) administer orally day , continuously 21-day cycle .</detailed_description>
