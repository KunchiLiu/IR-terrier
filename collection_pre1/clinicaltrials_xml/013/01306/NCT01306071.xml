	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic hepatitis B virus infection lead cause morbidity mortality end stage liver disease liver cancer . Although significant progress make recently hepatitis B therapy , current knowledge manage infection limit treatment trial involve 1 2 year therapy , even though patient require treatment much long duration optimal long-term outcome . To improve current knowledge disease long-term disease progression , Hepatitis B Research Network collect health disease information individual diagnose hepatitis B . Objectives : - To study individual hepatitis B identify factor affect way disease progress . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age diagnose hepatitis B . Design : - Participants screen physical examination medical history . Health information collect questionnaire survey health behavior , family history liver disease .
