	<brief_title>Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy ( HBO2 ) Persistent Post-concussive Symptoms After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( mTBI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Brain injury due trauma common ; nonetheless , pharmacological therapy know improve outcome . Medications use treat symptom , seizure affective disorder , intend affect fundamental problem . If HBO2 , regularly available relatively safe , improve outcome brain-injured subject treat underlie pathophysiology post-concussive syndrome , would represent significant advance treatment brain injury . Hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO2 ) propose treatment patient TBI . Hyperbaric oxygen one first pharmacologic intervention test population individual mild TBI chronic post-concussive symptom target improve cognition , memory , functional status . However , much unknown measure improvement post-concussive symptom intervention target active duty population . In preparation pivotal efficacy study , objective study characterize two candidate primary outcome tool intend study population , RPQ NSI , order well estimate sample size need answer efficacy question . Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) conduct comprehensive review literature , interview subject matter expert ( SME ) , conduct focus group SMEs evaluate evidence HBO2 patient TBI . The AHRQ conclude `` Although cite frequently , case series time-series study HBO2 TBI patient serious flaw . There high-quality study use HBO2 improve function quality life patient chronic , stable disability TBI . The important gap evidence lack good quality time-series study control trial effect HBO2 cognition , memory , functional status patient deficit due mild chronic TBI . '' Similarly , Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) approve HBO2 therapy treatment TBI cover condition , cite lack support evidence clinical efficacy . The Defense Centers Excellence Psychological Health Traumatic conclude sufficient case report , early safety feasibility study data , basic scientific plausibility exist warrant prompt experimental study HBO2 care full spectrum chronic TBI . This would best accomplished randomize , double-blind , multi-center clinical trial . This Phase 2 study , specific study design , inclusion exclusion criterion , interim end point analysis , treatment protocol , dose-response safety issue , evaluation methodology , safety , outcome measure address need clinical efficacy . In preparation pivotal trial , purpose Phase II study describe magnitude change baseline follow-up outcome battery neuropsychological test within group . A secondary objective explore change across four group . Differences variability test use determine optimum primary endpoint ( ) Phase III trial , well refinement sample size power calculation future study . Recruitment , randomization , blinding , study intervention logistics plan also assess .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Volunteers must history least one mild traumatic brain injury ( mTBI ) persistent symptom meet follow criterion : Brain injury occur 4 month prior enrollment , recent injury occur early October 7 , 2001 . Most recent traumatic brain injury occur serve active duty , deploy United States ( US ) Central Command ( USCENTCOM ) . Most recent traumatic brain injury cause blast exposure blunt trauma . Most recent traumatic brain injury result least one following : period loss decrease level consciousness ( 30 minute ) ; loss memory event immediately injury ( 24 hour ) ; alteration mental state time injury ( become daze confused ) . Volunteers must also meet follow criterion : 1865 year old time study enrollment . A TRICARE beneficiary time consent study participation . Has current complaint brain injury symptom headache , dizziness , cognitive affective problem score least 3 postconcussive symptom assess Ohio State University ( OSU ) Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) Identification ( ID ) Method interview Has receive current local care pharmacologic nonpharmacologic intervention TBI concomitant posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) significant change therapy least 1 month Willing commit comply research protocol complete outcome measure . Able selfconsent . Able speak read English , primary language . Able participate outcome measure . Able equalize middle ear pressure . History brain injury moderate severe degree : duration loss consciousness time injury great 30 minute , duration posttraumatic amnesia great 24 hour , brain injury penetrate etiology . History brain injury traumatic etiology , stroke druginduced coma . Prior treatment HBO2 . Hyperbaric chamber inside attendant , professional ( pay ) underwater diver ( commercial , operational/ military , instructor ) , technical diver . Pregnancy , woman plan become pregnant study period , woman agree practice acceptable form birth control study period , woman breastfeed ; Those unable participate fully outcome assessment ( Blind one eye ; Deaf one ears ; Ambulation assistive device Preexisting diagnosis psychotic disorder ( ) : schizophrenia , dissociative disorder , bipolar disease . Verifiable degenerative mental disease ( e.g. , Alzheimer 's disease , multiple sclerosis , senile dementia ) . Epilepsy seizure disorder require anticonvulsant . Active malignancy , prior malignancy ( except basal cell carcinoma ) within last 5 year . Presence chronic debilitate disease ( e.g. , endstage renal disease , endstage liver disease , type diabetes without sequela ) . Documented clinically significant uncorrected anemia Documented sickle cell disease . History therapeutic ionizing radiation head . Verifiable diagnosis learn disability . Positive urine test illicit substance ( ) . Any condition use prescribe medication ( lithium , cisplatin , doxorubicin , bleomycin ) receipt HBO2 would impact safety individual . Anticipated administrative separation , prolong temporary assign duty ( TAD/TDY ) deployment within 3 month randomization Claustrophobia ( unwilling unable enter hyperbaric chamber ) . Inability protect airway require frequent suctioning ; presence tracheostomy Heart failure ejection fraction &lt; 50 % ( due increase risk precipitate acute lung edema exposure HBO2 ) . Emphysema , chronic bronchitis , bullous lung disease ( due risk pulmonary barotrauma hyperbaric decompression ) . Diabetes ( relative contraindication relate risk hypoglycemia ) . Presence implanted device ( e.g. , cardiac defibrillator , intrathecal drug delivery device , cochlear implant ) pose increase risk subject hyperbaric exposure .</criteria>
