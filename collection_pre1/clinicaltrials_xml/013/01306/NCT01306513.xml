	<detailed_description>Study Rationale Emphysema one two main component chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) contribute many year airway obstruction loss elastic recoil around small airway . Emphysema induce cigarette smoking widely accept disease cause excessive proteolytic activity proteases chronic inflammatory process , characterize cellular influx consist macrophage , neutrophil T cell . This inflammatory response steroid resistant lead slow persistent alveolar destruction , result enlarged lung bullous part lung . In addition central role innate immunity , recent study suggest also ( auto ) antigen specific immunity may play role pathogenesis COPD . Currently , treatment available severe emphysema lung volume reduction surgery ( LVRS ) remove destroy part lung . The surgery generally perform two separate session 10-12 week interval , lung separate surgical target . This surgical treatment allow improved ventilation remain less affected area lung demonstrate post-surgical clinical improvement lung function increase survival subgroup patient . Delayed wound heal LVRS important clinical problem . It may lead prolonged hospital stay due air leakage lung thoracic cavity . Lung emphysema patient high risk prolong air leakage surgery , likely explain inflammatory process related disease . Mesenchymal stromal cell ( MSC ) multipotent cell differentiate several cell type , include fibroblast , osteoblast , adipocytes chondrocyte progenitor . In recent year become evident bone-marrow derive MSC ( BM-MSC ) potent immunomodulatory effect T B cell animal model chronic inflammation vivo . In addition , show MSC express release variety soluble factor implicate anti-apoptotic signal cell growth . Importantly , encourage result recently obtain treatment severe steroid resistant Graft versus Host Disease ( GvHD ) donor ( allogeneic ) BM-MSC . Furthermore , institute autologous BM-MSC currently investigation treatment tissue injury due autoimmune disease ( Crohn 's Disease ) allogeneic immune response ( renal transplant recipient biopsy proven subclinical rejection ) . The combination immunosuppressive , growth-potentiating anti-apoptotic property BM-MSC may lead accelerate wound heal LVRS might induce lung repair . In present phase I study investigator assess safety feasibility intravenous ( i.v . ) administration BM-MSC prior LVRS small group severe pulmonary emphysema patient . Results safety feasibility study may lead future study use BM-MSC immunomodulation induction repair patient pulmonary emphysema milder stage COPD . Objective To test safety feasibility intravenous administration autologous BM-MSC one-sided LVRS prior second LVRS procedure patient severe pulmonary emphysema . Study design Open label , non-randomized , non-blinded , prospective clinical trial . Patients operate two session ; initially one lung without pre-surgical infusion BM-MSC , follow second surgical procedure contralateral lung precede two i.v . infusion BM-MSC one week apart , 4 3 week prior lung surgery . Study population Patients least 40 year age end-stage emphysema eligible lung volume reduction surgery . Intervention The intervention consist two dos BM-MSC infusion 10 patient one week interval , 4 3 week prior second LVRS respectively . Study endpoints Primary endpoint : 1 . Safety feasibility intravenous infusion two dose BM-MSC 1 wk interval first LVRS prior second LVRS . Toxicity criterion evaluate grade accord WHO . Secondary endpoint : 1 . Difference day post-surgical transpleural air leak lung patient first ( infusion BM-MSC ) second surgical ( 3 week last i.v . infusion BM-MSC ) intervention . 2 . Histological response resect lung tissue ( measure immunohistochemistry marker inflammation , fibrosis repair ) .</detailed_description>
