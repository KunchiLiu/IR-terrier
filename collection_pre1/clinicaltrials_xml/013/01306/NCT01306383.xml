	<brief_summary>SODISWATER health impact assessment study investigate effect sunlight inactivate microbial pathogen drink water . This study carry observe whether child young 5 year old drink solar disinfected water healthier . Health measure often child diarrhoea dysentery . Caregivers participant give plastic bottle place sun , water sample collect plastic bottle analyze . They also request fill diarrhea diary . TESTABLE RESEARCH HYPOTHESES : Health Impact Assessment : Children use solar disinfected water : ( ) low morbidity due non-bloody diarrhoea bloody diarrhoea ( c ) increase growth rate ( ) low mortality ( e ) increase family productivity ( f ) decrease care-giver burden ( g ) increase school attendance</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current evidence base solar disinfection prevention diarrhoeal disease child rest three publish study . All share two significant weakness : carry Kenya , community high incidence diarrhoeal disease water characterise high level turbidity microbial contamination . Furthermore , neither study diarrhoeal disease distinguish dysentery ( associate significant risk mortality ) sort diarrhoea , carry far low risk . The present study extend evidence base community low risk high water quality . Furthermore , use pictorial diary , dysentery analyse specific health endpoint . Diarrhoea record consistent World Health organisation definition : three loose watery stool 24-hour period and/or stool contain blood mucus . AIM OF THE PROJECT IN RELATION TO HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDIES : The primary aim SODISWATER PROJECT demonstrate SODIS appropriate intervention diarrhoeal waterborne disease among community develop country affect natural man-made disaster conduct multi-centred epidemiologically control Health Impact Assessments SODIS technique across African Continent variety social , geographical climactic condition . SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES OF SODISWATER IN RELATION TO HEALTH IMPACT ASSESSMENT STUDIES : 1 . Assessment change health reasonably attribute provision solar disinfect drinking water point use 3 country ( Kenya , Zimbabwe Cambodia ) . 2 . Assessment relationship solar disinfect drinking water select health indicator ( include morbidity due non-bloody diarrhoea dysentery , weight loss , mortality , growth rate , productivity , care-giver burden , school attendance . Mortality also monitor sample sizes insufficient size produce detail information scaling , account possible due prohibitive cost ) . 3 . Demonstration effectiveness SODIS household level .</detailed_description>
