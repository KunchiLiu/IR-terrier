	<brief_summary>This open-label , multi-center , dose-finding study tivozanib administer combination capecitabine . During dose-escalation portion , sequential cohort subject advance solid tumor enrol order establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . If MTD reach , recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) determine . In expansion cohort , subject locally advanced metastatic breast colon cancer enrol MTD ( RP2D ) evaluate safety activity combination tumor type .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Tivozanib ( AV-951 ) Combination With Capecitabine ( Xeloda® ) Subjects With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase Ib , open-label , multi-center , dose-escalation study orally administer tivozanib combination capecitabine approximately 24 subject advance solid tumor , expand MTD cohort , subject locally advanced metastatic breast colorectal cancer . This study design evaluate safety , tolerability , dose-limiting toxicity , maximum tolerate dose , pharmacokinetic , antineoplastic activity . The number cohort evaluate maximum dos administer depend upon observed tolerability . Dose level `` 0 '' , tivozanib HCl 1.5 mg capecitabine 1000 mg/m² BID , start dose level . Once assigned cohort , subject continue treat dose level schedule throughout course study .</detailed_description>
