	<brief_title>Effect Fructose Reduction Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease ( NAFLD ) Metabolic Syndrome Overweight Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In intervention study total 100 overweight 50 normal weight child , age 5-8 year include . At begin , two 24-h dietary recall perform assess nutritional intake fructose consumption . Anthropometric parameter ( body weight height ) measure calculate BMI BMI-SDS child . Physical activity leisure time well socio-demographic status `` family background '' assess use different questionnaire . An ultrasound examination liver perform participant detection sign fatty liver . From child include study fast blood sample take determine follow blood parameter : ALT , AST , γ-GT , uric acid , blood lipid ( TG , HDL , LDL , Total cholesterol ) , blood alcohol , PAI-1 endotoxin concentration . A part blood sample use DNA-analysis . In child systolic ( SBP ) diastolic ( DBP ) blood pressure also measure . An oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) perform overnight fast 12 h ( glucose concentration : 1.75 g/kg body weight , maximum 75g ) . Simultaneously glucose hydrogen breath test perform assess small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) . After check-ups beginning study , child divide two study group : intervention group control group . Based daily fructose intake assess begin study , child participate intervention group advise reduce daily fructose intake 50 % . In first study year , every three month second study year , every six month , nutritional counseling repeat small group parent child separately train . If family participate control group wish , receive dietary counseling base reference `` DGE '' begin study . After first second study year examination repeat participant ( ultrasound examination second study year ) .</detailed_description>
