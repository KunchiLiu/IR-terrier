	<brief_summary>Purpose : Prospective study patient hyperparathyroidism warrant determine prevalence concurrent thyroid disease apply current standard pre-operative radioscintigraphic sonographic image neck . Timely diagnosis treatment co-existing thyroid disease advantageous give well-established increased morbidity associate second neck exploration . The purpose study determine prevalence specific type thyroid disease patient hyperparathyroidism , determine frequency presence thyroid disease alters treatment plan patient hyperparathyroidism . Research Design : This prospective single arm observational study 200 military health care beneficiary age 18 year primary secondary hyperparathyroidism schedule undergo parathyroid resection . Methodology : Patients undergo standard pre-operative imaging neck include ultrasonography 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy . An operative plan develop base information obtain history , physical examination , laboratory study , image study . The number type thyroid disease patient determine base non-invasive study ( Objective A ) . A change otherwise standard treatment include patient partial complete resection thyroid gland : ) patient would undergo minimally invasive surgery result image study , , b ) patient would undergo 3 Â½ gland parathyroidectomy result image study ( Objective B ) .</brief_summary>
