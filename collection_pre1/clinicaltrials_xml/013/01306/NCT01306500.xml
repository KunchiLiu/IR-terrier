	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate role gastric lavage prevent feed problem baby bear meconium stain amniotic fluid . It routine practice many hospital perform gastric lavage baby bear meconium stain amniotic fluid stabilisation without support evidence . It believe meconium irritant presence stomach cause gastritis vomit hence basis practice . Orogastric tube insertion subsequent gastric lavage without complication . Potential complication prevent health resource save procedure proven beneficial . Therefore investigator decide study gastric lavage reduces incidence vomit feed difficulty well incidence respiratory difficulty baby bear MSAF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Gastric Lavage Preventing Feeding Problems Babies Born With Meconium Stained Amniotic Fluid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Meconium passage newborn infant developmentally program event normally occur within first 24-48 hour birth . The meconium stain amniotic fluid occur 12 % live birth per annuum . The routine use gastric lavage MSAF baby advocate long time part conventional treatment . Meconium stomach hypothesize act irritant cause vomit retch . Surprisingly recommendation also make textbook without support evidence . Orogastric tube insertion subsequent gastric lavage cause complication like bradycardia , apnea , vomit , trauma , aspiration esophageal gastric perforation . Some researcher find gastric suction do birth associate long term risk functional intestinal disorder . The sequence prefeeding behaviour disrupt child undergo gastric suction delay initiation breast feeding . Small elevation mean arterial blood pressure , increase retching also report The role gastric lavage prevent feed problem secondary meconium aspiration syndrome systematically evaluate . If procedure prove beneficial prevent potential complication may arise due significant number baby . Also resource limit country cost material require time medical personnel save . Hence purpose prospective randomize control trial compare incidence feed problem secondary meconium aspiration syndrome , gastric lavage group vs lavage group .</detailed_description>
