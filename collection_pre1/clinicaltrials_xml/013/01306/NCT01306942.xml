	<brief_summary>This single-arm , open-label , phase I/II study . In phase I , patient HER2-positive MBC treat paclitaxel , trastuzumab increase dos dasatinib determine MTD ( Maximum Tolerated Dose ) , DLT ( Dose Limiting Toxicity ) RPD ( Recommended Phase II Dose ) combination . Once RPD identify , 48 additional patient treat dose evaluate efficacy safety combination phase II . Primary Objective : - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RPD ) dasatinib combination fix dose trastuzumab paclitaxel HER2-positive MBC patient ( Phase I ) . - To determine efficacy , measure objective response rate ( ORR ) HER2-positive MBC patient measurable disease ( Phase II ) . Primary Endpoint : - To determine incidence rate dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) within first cycle dasatinib combination trastuzumab paclitaxel dose level HER2-positive MBC patient ( Phase I ) . - To assess ORR ( define RECIST 1.1 complete response rate + partial response rate ) measure appropriate radiological test HER2-positive MBC patient measurable disease ( Phase II ) . Sample Size : Phase I : follow 3+3 rule , minimum 6 maximum 12 patient recruit . Phase II : Assuming 10 % drop-out rate , 48 patient require enter study . The duration study , first patient visit last patient visit approximately 42 month .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Female histologically confirm breast cancer document metastasis . Patients must HER2 overexpression immunohistochemistry ( 3+ , Herceptest ; DAKO ) positive fluorescence situ hybridization HER2 amplification evaluate central laboratory . It recommend formalinfixed paraffin embed ( FFPE ) tumor tissue block metastatic site ( primary tumor , metastatic site available ) require HER2 test provide . Patients measurable non measurable disease Phase I part . For Phase II patient measurable disease define per RECIST 1.1 include . Signed Written Informed Consent . Patients Performance Status ( ECOG ) 0 1 . Number previous therapy allow previous therapy may include : 1 . Chemotherapy : prior chemotherapy MBC permit . Patients treat adjuvant chemotherapy regimen base taxanes allow include fully recover taxane associate toxicity minimum 12 month elapse end therapy . 2 . Hormonal Therapy : patient may prior hormonal therapy . All hormonal agent must discontinue least 3 week prior study entry . 3 . Radiation Therapy : patient may prior radiation therapy exceed 25 % bone marrow reserve . A minimum 21 day must elapse last dose radiation registration study . Patients must recover acute toxic effect radiation prior registration . Lesions irradiate included site measurable disease phase II unless clear tumor progression , accord RECIST criterion , document lesion since end radiation therapy . 4 . Previous Surgery : previous surgery permit provide wound heal occur . 5 . AntiHER2 Therapies : prior antiHER2 therapy MBC permit . Patients treat adjuvant antiHER2 therapy ( include limit trastuzumab lapatinib ) allow include minimum 12 month elapse end therapy . Adequate Organ Function . Ability take oral medication ( dasatinib must swallow whole ) . Patient , age 18 year old . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Patients know brain metastasis . No malignancy [ one treat study ] require radiotherapy systemic treatment within past 5 year . Concurrent medical condition may increase risk toxicity , include : Pleural pericardial effusion grade . Cardiac Symptoms ; follow consider exclusion : 1 . Uncontrolled angina , congestive heart failure MI within ( 6 month ) 2 . Patients intercurrent cardiac dysfunction LVEF &lt; 50 % . 3 . Diagnosed congenital long QT syndrome . 4 . Any history clinically significant ventricular arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation , Torsades de pointes ) . 5 . Prolonged QTc interval preentry electrocardiogram ( 450 msec ) . 6 . Patients hypokalemia hypomagnesemia correct prior dasatinib administration . History significant bleeding disorder unrelated cancer , include : 1 . Diagnosed congenital bleeding disorder ( e.g. , von Willebrand 's disease ) . 2 . Diagnosed acquire bleed disorder within one year ( e.g. , acquire antifactor VIII antibody ) . 3 . Ongoing recent ( 3 month ) significant gastrointestinal bleeding . Patients know allergy study drug component . Preexistent toxicities severity grade 2 due previous anticancer treatment .</criteria>
