	<detailed_description>The therapeutic management recommendation patient metastatic cancer offer standard treatment specific situation . But , always subgroup patient benefit treatment low survival . The risk death patient variable depend initial cancer site , tumor aggressiveness chemosensitivity tumour . It 's therefore important relevant prognostic tool predict excess relative toxicity drug resistance . Simple prognostic factor survival performance status ( PS ) already highlight several study . Thus , possibility identify group patient high risk mortality could major interest clinician . In fact stratification allow : - To limit risk adjust therapy and/or associate treatment ( antibiotic prophylaxis , dose reduction ... ) , - To develop protocol test innovative strategy specific high risk population . The objective innovative protocol would design correct lymphodivpenia . The main objective show T divpenia ( low TCR combinatorial diversity &lt; 30 % ) risk factor early death chemotherapy ( early death : death occur within 3 month ( lung cancer ) within 6 month ( breast cancer ) start chemotherapy ) . The secondary objective : - To establish divpenia factor independent clinical biological prognostic factor ( PS , LDH , haemoglobin , lymphopenia ANC ) predict early death , - To establish prognostic score NDL combine two-dimensional graph CD4 count total lymphocytes count TCR repertoire diversity allow good stratification lympho-divpenic patient benefit appropriate treatment , - To characterize circulate marker could improve identification early death risk ( phenotypic marker , cytokine ... ) combination previous setting . Prognostic model establish many tumor type initial stage time relapse ( breast lung cancer ... ) . It seem necessary highlight clinical biological prognostic factor would estimate low survival 6 month , whatever nature original site tumour . The strong prognostic value lymphopenia early death chemotherapy hematologic toxicity chemotherapy recently establish several tumor model . 25 % patient metastatic solid cancer systemic immune dysfunction . Further analysis incorporate prior treatment ( D0 ) systematic phenotypic analysis lymphocyte subpopulation patient ' blood show significant reduction absolute number peripheral CD4+ T cell ( &lt; 450/μl ) independent factor risk early death febrile neutropenia patient solid cancer different origin ( lymphoma , myeloma , sarcoma , breast cancer ) treat chemotherapy . However , early death remain rare event recent study establish lymphopenia ( &lt; 1000 lymphocytes/µl ) independent prognostic factor overall survival patient solid tumour . Recent study show importance combinatorial diversity T B lymphocytes repertoire ( TCR/BCR ) efficiency immune response infection . A preliminary analysis TCR repertoire diversity , retrospective cohort patient metastatic breast cancer , demonstrate independent predictive value divpenia overall survival patient . This research demonstrate patient cancer large disparity immune TCR diversity always correlate lymphocyte count . These preliminary data show discriminate power TCR diversity great measurement cell count . The combined analysis data NDL® graph may help good discriminate patient risk necessary develop new therapeutic strategy .</detailed_description>
