	<brief_summary>This study evaluate effect ranibizumab patient undergo vitrectomy surgery complication diabetic retinopathy . Vitrectomy surgery difficult bleeding operation reduce vision patient . Our hypothesis injection eye ranibizumab one week surgery make surgery easy , reduce complication improve outcome . In trial , patient randomly allocate receive either ranibizumab injection placebo injection saline . Neither patient , surgeon , study investigator know receive fair comparison make .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The RaDiVit study pilot randomise control trial evaluate effect ranibizumab adjunct diabetic vitrectomy surgery . Patients complication proliferative diabetic retinopathy require vitrectomy surgery recruit study . Baseline test perform , include refract visual acuity , B-scan ultrasound , OCT scanning , colour fundus photography fundus fluorescein angiography . Patients randomise 1:1 receive either ranibizumab intravitreal injection saline subconjunctival injection . One week later , surgery carry . The baseline test repeat day surgery examine discernible difference two group one week treatment . Surgery video record detailed assessment operative detail carry . A vitreous sample pair serum sample take time surgery compare level ranibizumab relate cytokine . Follow visit take place six twelve week . Assessments point include : - visual acuity - OCT scan - colour fundus photography fundus fluorescein angiography</detailed_description>
