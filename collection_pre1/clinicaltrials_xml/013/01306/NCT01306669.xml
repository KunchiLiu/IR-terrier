	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory illness significant contributor neonatal mortality lead cause under- 5 childhood mortality particularly infancy . Infants 6 month age high rate excess influenza-associated hospitalization industrialize country among paediatric age group . Determining contribution influenza early childhood morbidity mortality sub-Saharan Africa potential prevent influenza disease vaccination may contribute reduce childhood death ; since influenza illness vaccine preventable disease vaccine develop , license available reasonable cost . Unfortunately , infant high risk serious disease 6 month age , trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) poorly immunogenic license . As pregnant woman also increase risk serious illness ( 3.3-5.5 fold hospitalization influenza-associated acute cardio-respiratory illness ) influenza infection , one strategy prevent complication influenza pregnant woman young infant maternal TIV immunization , recommend WHO . This could result direct protection woman protection young infant consequent transplacental transfer TIV induce antibody . Barriers administration vaccine pregnancy include lack information effectiveness concern safety probably explain virtual non-existent use TIV pregnant woman low-middle income country . Recently data become available Bangladesh benefit maternal TIV vaccination demonstrate 63 % ( 95 % CI 5 85 ) reduction laboratory-confirmed influenza illness infant 24 week age child bear mother vaccinate TIV 36 % reduction clinical illness vaccinate mother . Much influenza virus-associated morbidity mortality may due synergistic lethality influenza bacterial pathogen lead pneumonia well viral co-infections . Superimposed bacterial infection , especially Streptococcus pneumoniae , contribute large proportion pneumonia death associate influenza illness pandemic . The overall aim project evaluate safety , immunogenicity efficacy TIV vaccination HIV-uninfected pregnant woman prevent influenza related illness young infant , well among woman .</detailed_description>
