	<brief_title>Cryoablation Invasive Breast Carcinoma Following Neoadjuvant Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Procedure : To perform cryoablation study , doctor insert cryoprobe like needle tip rest middle cancerous area . In study , ultrasound image device also use allow doctor see insert cryoprobe . If find eligible agree take part study , ultrasound-guided biopsy confirm diagnosis . To perform ultrasound-guided biopsy , tissue sample withdrawn breast use needle syringe . A small amount tissue take . The needle guide view doctor ultrasound . Cryoablation : Before cryoablation procedure , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Within 30 day join study , cryoablation procedure perform . The affected area first numb anesthetic . Your study doctor insert cryoprobe needle use ultrasound device help guide cryoprobe reach cancerous area . When place , cryoprobe use freeze cancerous area . The doctor careful try avoid damage surround normal tissue . The cryoablation procedure last 20 minute . The cryoprobe remove doctor think cancerous area treat much possible . There small wound , like puncture wound large needle . Most likely , need stitch close wound . First Follow-Up Visit : About 2-4 week cryoablation : - You physical exam . - You MRI scan breast check status disease . This scan research purpose . Researchers want learn MRI scan cryoablation detect remain breast cancer . Your MRI scan ultrasound image review study radiologist . This include MRI scan cryoablation , ultrasound image cryoablation . Surgery : Within 4 week cryoablation , standard-of-care surgery remove remain area treat cryoablation . You ask sign separate consent form describe surgery detail . After surgery , doctor also check see cryoablation destroy cancerous area . This help researcher learn cryoablation effective . Second Follow-Up Visit : About 2 week surgery : - You physical exam . - You ask side effect may cryoablation surgery . When finish cryoablation surgery , doctor decide need additional treatment . Additional treatment consider part study . Your doctor able answer question may additional treatment . Length Study Participation : You remain study 2 month . You take study early disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . This investigational study . The ultrasound-guided cryoablation system use cryoablation procedure FDA-approved use cancer . The use system breast cancer chemotherapy investigational . Up 10 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Unifocal primary invasive ductal breast carcinoma diagnose core needle biopsy . NOTE : Patients lobular carcinoma , multifocal and/or multicentric ipsilateral breast cancer , multifocal calcification , DCIS microinvasion NOT eligible . Patients contralateral disease remain eligible . 2 . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy hormonal therapy index tumor require . 3 . Residual tumor size &lt; /= 2.0 cm great diameter . Specifically , tumor must measure &lt; /= 2.0 cm axis parallel treatment probe &lt; /= 1.5 cm axis antiparallel treatment probe . Largest size measure mammogram , ultrasound MRI use determine eligibility . 4 . Tumor enhancement preregistration MRI . 5 . Tumor &lt; 25 % intraductal component aggregate . 6 . Adequate breast size safe cryoablation . Male breast cancer patient female breast cancer patient breast small allow safe cryoablation eligible minimal thickness breast tissue lend cryoablation . 7 . Patients prior insitu invasive breast carcinoma eligible prior carcinoma occur contralateral breast . Patients prior insitu invasive carcinoma ipsilateral breast eligible . 1 . History open surgical biopsy and/or lumpectomy diagnosis/treatment index breast cancer . Note : Prior rotational and/or vacuumassisted core biopsy permit significant distortion see image could obscure visualization detection residual disease MRI , visualization cancer ultrasound cryoablation procedure . 2 . Pregnant and/or lactating . Patients childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test . NOTE : Perimenopausal woman must amenorrheic &gt; 12 month consider childbearing potential . 3 . Patient contraindication MRI examination , clips/prostheses/implants MRI compatible , compromised renal function , measure calculate glomerular filtration rate 60ml/min/1.73m^2 4 . Patients le 18 year age include study .</criteria>
