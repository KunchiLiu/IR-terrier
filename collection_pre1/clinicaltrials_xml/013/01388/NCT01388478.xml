	<brief_title>Safety Study R ( + ) Pramipexole Treat Early Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit Univ Kansas Alzheimer 's Center provide inform consent participating . R ( + ) -pramipexole provide Good Manufacturing Practice powder take liquid start one teaspoon ( 5 ml ) twice day total dose 100 mg/day . After 4 week , dose double ( two teaspoon twice day , total 200mg/day ) . Four week later dose increase 2 1/2 teaspoon twice day ( total 300mg/day ) remain remain 16 week study treatment . Prior increase , participant study partner interview regard possible side effect problem . These finding discuss Dr. Burns prior increase study drug dose . The dose increase participant side effect . Primary Outcome Measure : 1.Number Patients Adverse Events [ Time Frame : Every 2 month ] [ Safety Issue : Yes ] Labwork perform every two month . There frequent contact subject assess adverse event . Secondary Outcome Measures : Reduction Oxidative Stress [ Time Frame : Baseline 24 week take study drug ] [ Safety Issue : No ] A lumbar puncture ( spinal tap ) perform collect cerebral spinal fluid , assay isoprostane level treatment . Changes cerebral glucose metabolism [ Time Frame : Baseline 24 week take drug ] [ Safety Issue : No ] Positron Emission Tomography Scan perform . Changes cerebral glucose metabolism proxy mitochondrial respiration assay baseline 24 week . Correlations seek assay oxidative stress reduction see great reduction brain oxidative stress reflect elevation cortical 2-fluorodeoxyglucose . Effects Cognitive Performance [ Time Frame : Baseline 6 month thereafter ] [ Safety Issue : Yes ] Quantitative assessment cognitive status take baseline end 6 month dose period .</detailed_description>
