	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study DRL-17822 , Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein ( CETP ) Inhibitor , Patients With Abnormal Cholesterol Levels</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease lead cause death worldwide . Among cardiovascular disorder , coronary heart disease ( CHD ) cause atherosclerosis common cause morbidity mortality . Prevention , stabilization regression atherosclerotic plaque may major impact reduce risk acute coronary event . LDL-C lowering agent , primarily statins , current mainstay pharmacologic management dyslipidemia . However even stain use , residual CHD risk dyslipidemia remain . Epidemiologic observational study show HDL-C also strong independent predictor CHD , suggest raise HDL-C level might afford clinical benefit reduction cardiovascular risk . Presently niacin approve FDA HDL-C elevation raise HDL-C level 20-30 % . However use limited high incidence flushing , less commonly , elevation blood glucose potential hepatic toxicity . Cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) inhibitor explore ability elevate HDL-C. A small molecule CETP inhibitor , torcetrapib , demonstrated elevate HDL-C 60-100 % . However , large clinical trial ( ILLUMINATE ) increase HDL-C mean 72 % compare baseline halt fail show benefit . Post-hoc analysis study implicate off-target increase blood pressure potentially counteract anti-atherosclerotic benefit . Post-hoc subgroup analysis show patient high HDL-C quartile 57 % reduction risk cardiovascular event . Increased blood pressure appear specifically relate torcetrapib two small molecule CETP inhibitor , anacetrapib dalcetrapib , show clinical trial well tolerate . DRL-17822 also show elevation blood pressure either animal normal volunteer . This study investigate efficacy tolerability DRL-17822 dyslipidemia monotherapy patient Type II hyperlipidemia .</detailed_description>
