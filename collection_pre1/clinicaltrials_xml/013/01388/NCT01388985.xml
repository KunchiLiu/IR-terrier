	<detailed_description>Rabies viral infection affect central nervous system cause encephalitis almost invariably fatal . Being zoonosis , infection usually occur follow transdermal bite scratch infect animal , contamination may also occur infectious material , usually saliva , come direct contact victim 's mucosa fresh skin wound . Human-to-human transmission extremely uncommon . Rabies widely distribute across globe : World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate 87 country total population 2,4 billion people afflicted endemic canine rabies , inclusion specie pose potential threat &gt; 3.3 billion people . The number rabid wild animal die without detect however estimate 90 % total , identified infection represent small fraction wild animal rabies case . Vaccination domestic animal limit industrialized nation , urbanized area Latin America Asian country Thailand . The development clinical rabies prevent timely immunization exposure infect agent : preventive vaccination alone imply complete protection , simplify post-exposure procedure considerably , immunoglobulin longer need less vaccine administration schedule . Pre-exposure prophylaxis consist intramuscular ( IM ) intradermal ( ID ) dose give day 0 , 7 21 28 . The development immunological memory vaccination therefore critical establishment long lasting immunity rabies human . If booster dose give 1 year pre-exposure prophylaxis , subject segregate 'good ' 'poor ' responder ; former group , represent 75 % subject , may need booster vaccination 10 year , whereas latter may need frequent booster . Until recently , guideline travel medicine recommend pre-exposure vaccination classic risk group . Since recent study show effectiveness ID vaccination , policy change towards recommendation pre-exposure vaccination large population , include traveler endemic region , rabies immunoglobulins vaccine often readily available . The ID pre-exposure vaccination , cost-effective , could also become affordable alternative protect local population high endemic region . Based , investigator must stress concept `` boostability '' risk exposure : main target travel medicine today get sufficient serological response day 7 risk prevaccinated person ( accelerate immune response memory cell ) two post-exposure vaccination ( day 0 3 ) . It also note schedule 1 week would preferable current schedule , would less time consuming , would improve compliance give less interference intake prophylaxis measure , e.g . mefloquine . Two recent small study Thailand suggest accelerate schedule three intradermal injection within 1 week interval effective immunogenic administer within 4 week . Therefore , randomize , non-inferiority study investigate whether accelerated schedule effective classical schedule . The investigator also increase number site injection , one two , stimulate several different group lymph nodes time initiate antibody production .</detailed_description>
