	<brief_summary>The research question address `` Does 2.5 - 5 minute systemic intravenous injection sodium nitrite administer immediately open infarct relate artery result significant reduction ischaemia reperfusion injury patient first acute ST elevation myocardial infarction ( MI ) ? ''</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitrites Acute Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There estimate 125,000 acute myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) UK every year . Although substantial progress make reduce infarct size prompt open infarct relate artery ( thrombolytic therapy percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) ) , effective therapy reduce infarct size would substantially reduce risk patient subsequently develop heart failure . There grow body evidence study animal use nitrite may help reduce infarct size , although test man . In phase 2/3 study , investigator propose investigate effect sodium nitrite injection infarct size . Eligible patient male age 18 female age 55 , present within 12 hour onset chest pain , suitable treatment percutaneous coronary intervention . Those give verbal agreement take part receive 2.5-5 minute injection sodium nitrite ( placebo ) immediately prior block artery open percutaneous coronary intervention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men age ≥18 year , woman age ≥55 year , woman &lt; 55years sterilise , hysterectomy effective contraception thus possibility pregnant ; present within 12 hour onset chest pain ST segment elevation 1mm elevation limb lead 2mm elevation two contiguous chest lead new left bundle branch block ( LBBB ) clinical decision make treat primary PCI eligible enrolment . Occlusion culprit relate artery ( TIMI grade 0 TIMI grade 1 ) also require inclusion . Eligible patient North European descent . Exclusion criterion Historical ECG evidence previous myocardial infarction Patients prior coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) Prior revascularization procedure procedure ( PCI ) perform territory current infarct Known suspect pregnancy Contraindications MRI Patients cardiac arrest cardiogenic shock Patients leave main coronary occlusion Patients know moderate severe renal failure ( estimate GFR &lt; 30mls/min ) , liver failure Patients prior thrombolysis event Patients Left Main disease PCI culprit lesion ( culprit lesion may locate LAD LCx RCA ) likely require CABG within time course study period ( 6 month ) .</criteria>
