	<brief_title>e- Ab Sensor - Based Real-time Diagnosis Enterovirus Type 71</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Entervirus 71 one important infectious disease child important concern public health . Since 1998 , EV71 become endemic disease Taiwan cause hundred severe case dozen fatal case year due lack EV71 vaccine . Family transmission study also show highly contagious among household well daycares kindergarten . Therefore , rapid diagnosis clinically necessary provide clinician rapid answer make early treatment possible reduce complication case-fatality rate . In addition , early diagnosis patient alert parent public health worker prevent contact earlier limit EV71 spread . Electrosensing antibody probe system ( e- Ab sensor ) , develop rapid sensitive detection hapten , proteins viral antigen medical sample , use analyze interaction kinetics Q.anti-EV71 antigen EV71 present EV71 patient normal sample . The system incorporate use engineer semiconductive antibody virus vertical lateral chip ( eVchip ) lateral flow ( eVsignal ) format . In electrosensing virus probing , semiconductive antibody bound suitable electrosensing probe specifically selectively bind EV71 epitope target molecule test serum . In comparison result direct sequence EV71 , investigator evaluate performance e- Ab sensor , include reproducibility , sensitivity , specificity , cross-reaction . The potential factor may interfere result would investigate . e- Ab sensor threshold decision must maximize sensitivity . Therefore , threshold value test group find decision could 90 % sensitivity 90 % specificity . With technique , investigator hope make early diagnosis give EV71 patient early treatment reduce complication case-fatality rate .</detailed_description>
