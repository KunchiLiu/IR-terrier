	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose research study learn two HIV test - clinical `` presumptive diagnosis '' ( PD ) train healthcare provider quickly use determine child likely HIV-infected need HIV medicine `` expedite '' gold standard RNA-PCR test ( expedite PCR ) do UNC Project lab locate hospital result give within 48 hour . Both test obtain result quickly current test call dry blood spot DNA-PCR go lab result may take one month . The performance PD expedite PCR compare one another respect HIV-infected infant correctly initiate life-saving antiretroviral therapy . Participants : Hospitalized child young 12 month age HIV DNA-PCR eligible Kamuzu Central Hospital ( KCH ) , Lilongwe , Malawi . Other participant patient caregiver clinical officer provide healthcare child could HIV-infected . Clinical officer train conduct presumptive diagnosis test . Procedures ( method ) : Patients randomize either standard care ( PD dry blood spot DNA-PCR ) expedite PCR . A consultant pediatrician clinical officer perform PD . If PD expedite PCR test result positive , hospital care could include HIV medicine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background A majority HIV-infected child die two year age without antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . Unfortunately , diagnose HIV age group complex require virologic test . This serve barrier young HIV-infected ( HIV+ ) child access ART resource-constrained generalized epidemic country . Malawi , high HIV-prevalence country sub-Saharan Africa , implement national early infant diagnosis ( EID ) program utilizing virologic test dried blood spot ( DBS ) DNA PCR technology 2007 address gap . In coordination national EID program 2008 , implement routine HIV test strategy within pediatric inpatient ward Kamuzu Central Hospital ( KCH ) incorporate DBS . While initial program result encourage , observe 50.2 % DBS recipient return test result hospital discharge , drain resource reduce potential impact definitive virologic test early diagnosis . DBS technology contribute factor low patient follow-up require burdensome transport lengthy processing highly trained laboratory personnel , require patient return several week test result . Currently Malawi , case throughout sub-Saharan Africa , definitive virologic test provide test result prior hospital discharge routinely available . Two alternative could potentially strengthen EID pediatric ART access routine use presumptive diagnosis ( PD ) , clinical HIV diagnostic algorithm young child , adjunct DBS definitive inpatient virologic test provide result hospital discharge ( `` expedite PCR '' ) instead PD DBS . This research proposal primarily aim validate PD test well assess impact PD expedite PCR upon patient outcome within establish inpatient pediatric HIV test system KCH . RESEARCH QUESTION TO BE ADDRESSED BY THIS PROPOSAL Is presumptive diagnosis , adjunct dry blood spot DNA PCR , valid approach diagnose HIV hospitalize Malawian child younger 12 month age , strategy , compare expedite inpatient virologic diagnosis , affect patient outcome ? RATIONALE FOR RESEARCH Globally , estimate 2.2 million child young 15 year age HIV-infected 2007 , approximately 90 % live sub-Saharan Africa . Malawi , sub-Saharan African country 13.2 million people , report adult HIV prevalence 11.9 % . While 91,000 HIV+ child estimate live Malawi 2007 , le 8 % Malawian child ever HIV test . Additionally , HIV+ child comprise 8 % national ART recipient , well 2014 goal 15 % . To address gap , Malawi approve routine offering HIV testing , provider initiate HIV test counseling ( PITC ) , line global recommendation 2007 . While high HIV prevalence hospitalize Malawian child current guideline support routine inpatient HIV testing , clear implementation strategy hospital offer . Substantial percentage HIV+ infant suffer high mortality without early infant diagnosis ( EID ) ART initiation , irrespective CD4 % , leading recommendation HIV+ child younger 1 year age universally initiated ART . Despite simplification ART eligibility age group , diagnose HIV remain complex . Maternal HIV antibody circulate blood stream child 12 month age , confound HIV antibody test result unable discriminate mother 's child 's antibody . Accordingly , DNA PCR test detects HIV proviral DNA gold standard HIV diagnosis age group . To date PCR technology utilized EID program throughout sub-Saharan Africa , include Malawi , DBS . Malawi pilot EID program starting 2007 approve policy universal ART HIV+ child younger 1 year age 2008 . In Malawi , uniform first line fixed-dose combination ART regimen stavudine , lamivudine , nevirapine provide free charge Malawian government eligible patients.The EID program since expand 14 28 district . Importantly , national EID program identify pediatric inpatient ward critical access point routine DBS testing , recently report EID site establish routine inpatient test program . KCH referral hospital 215 bed pediatric ward locate capital Lilongwe 10,000 pediatric admission annually . In 2007 , le 10 % pediatric inpatient KCH estimate accessed voluntary HIV counsel test ( VCT ) service offer lay counselor ( Pediatric Department , KCH , unpublished data ) . In January 2008 , implement PITC program utilizing DBS test KCH inpatient pediatric department collaboration Baylor International Pediatric AIDS Initiative ( BIPAI ) , KCH , Lighthouse . The overall program objective improve inpatient pediatric HIV diagnosis care , establish EID routine inpatient service , provide national guidance inpatient pediatric PITC program expansion . Over first 12 month implementation , PITC program offer HIV test 45.2 % admission , 10,245 mother hospitalize child , represent four-fold increase comparison pre-PITC estimates1 . 98.7 % mother-child pair accept test , observed HIV prevalence hospitalize child 8.5 % , nearly two-fold high estimate community pediatric prevalence 4.8 % Malawi . Furthermore , 73.9 % HIV+ hospitalize child yet access ART , despite 70 % patient clinically immunologically eligible . The program also complete 476 DBS test time period , represent high volume EID site Malawi , 40.1 % test positive . Unfortunately , 239 DBS recipient , 50.2 % child test , enrol outpatient care Baylor College Medicine-Abbott Fund Children 's Clinical Centre Excellence clinic KCH . Of , 48.3 % initiated ART median 2.4 month DBS collection . Low follow-up experience EID site throughout Malawi . One contribute factor several week process time require DBS sample . In Malawi , DBS test transport central laboratory process high volume sophisticated equipment highly specialized laboratory personnel . Therefore , counselor instruct caregiver return least one month child 's DBS test result . If caregiver return child 's result , commonly re-referred HIV care another site , often even later date , delay evaluation ART eligibility . Currently , similar system exist KCH . Despite substantial investment EID , process transport delay inherent DBS lessen impact EID result continue barrier pediatric ART access age group . Two diagnostic alternative could reduce delay complicate current DBS system PD point care virologic testing . While PD less sensitive specific diagnostic alternative PCR , require limited resource provide strategy immediately offer ART hospitalize patient fulfill PD criterion , avoid one-month wait time resultant loss follow-up . Malawi National guideline recommend use PD identify initiate symptomatic HIV+ infant younger 12 month age ART PCR unavailable . While sensitivity specificity PD previously report Rwanda Kenya , study partly applicable Malawi due low estimate malaria burden Rwandese child , mixture inpatient outpatient within Kenyan study cohort . Both scenario likely alter report sensitivity specificity PD compare Malawi , justify need generate locally applicable data . To date , PD widely practice Malawi , data generate research could provide guidance increase usefulness PD . The primary limitation PD HIV-uninfected patient could incorrectly start ART . However , possible patient might still experience low mortality HIV transmission rate , little adverse effect , suggest recent outcome extend post-natal antiretroviral prophylaxis study . Point care virologic testing , hand , potential revolutionize pediatric HIV care HIV+ hospitalize infant could receive day , accurate diagnostic result , allow immediate evaluation ART eligibility initiation . While point care virologic test yet approve routine use , enhance laboratory service available University North Carolina Project ( UNC Project ) offer HIV RNA PCR test result less 48 hour . `` Expedited '' virologic test likely provide definitive HIV test result nearly hospitalize HIV-exposed infant prior discharge , therefore replicate affect point care virologic test produce hospitalize setting . Understanding expedited PCR test affect inpatient ART uptake , outpatient follow-up , long term outcome , compare current standard care , critical system development strengthen anticipation future point care test availability . This research proposal seek utilize current inpatient pediatric PITC system establish KCH validate PD within hospital setting , well investigate patient outcomes utilizing current EID standard care ( PD DBS ) compare expedited PCR .</detailed_description>
