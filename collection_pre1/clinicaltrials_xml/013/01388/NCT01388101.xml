	<brief_title>Real-time Diagnosis Serum LECT 2 Patient With Liver Cancer Using Electronic Antibody Sensor ( e- Ab Sensor )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) one common type cancer world . High cancer recurrence still major cause death HCC patient . The major poor prognostic factor include vascular invasion , high Î±-FP , large tumor size , tumor satellitosis , etc . Among various literature report multivariate analysis , vascular invasion tumor major contribution high recurrence poor survival . Therefore , identify differentially express gene vascular-invasion non-vascular invasion HCCs important . After suppression subtractive hybridization microarray experiment , investigator identify 20 differentially-expressed gene vascular-invasive , non-vascular invasive HCCs . One interesting gene leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 ( LECT2 ) . Further evaluation role LECT2 HCCs , investigator find ( 1 ) Higher invasiveness , low LECT2 gene expression HCC cell line . ( 2 ) Conditioned medium high LECT2 content inhibit HCC invasion . ( 3 ) The invasion ability decrease LECT2-overexpression hepatoma cell line . ( 4 ) In transendothelial cell migration assay , investigator could observe invasion ability increase LECT2 knockdown HCC cell line . ( 5 ) The low expression LECT2 gene human HCCs correlate high tumor stage , early recurrence , poor prognosis . ( 6 ) In vivo experiment reveal LECT2 inhibit ability intravasation metastatic ability HCC . Electrosensing antibody probe system ( e- Ab sensor ) , develop rapid sensitive detection hapten , protein , viral antigen medical sample , use analyze interaction kinetics specific anti- LECT2 antigen ( LECT2 liver cancer ) present specimens patient liver cancer . The system incorporate use engineer semiconductive antibody virus vertical lateral chip ( eAbchip ) lateral flow ( eAbsignal ) format . In electrosensing antibody probing , semiconductive antibody bound suitable electrosensing probe , specifically selectively bind targeted molecule ( i.e . specific LECT2 ) test specimen . From assessment electric signature semiconductive mutation-specific anti-LECT2 antibody , eABprobe could offer sensitive detection precise quantification specific LECT2 . To develop real-time diagnostic technique e- Ab sensor specific LECT2 detection clinical specimen HCC patient , investigator conduct prospective clinical study . The investigator evaluate performance e- Ab sensor , include reproducibility , sensitivity , specificity , cross-reaction . With technique , investigator obtain LECT2 information HCC patient cost-saving time-saving way offer individualized treatment patient .</detailed_description>
