	<brief_summary>Autism developmental disorder characterize abnormality speech communication , impaired social functioning , repetitive behavior interest . The term `` Autism spectrum disorder '' ASD often use include autistic disorder , Asperger syndrome pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specify ( PDD-NOS ) . Epidemiological research suggest ASDs affect least 60 per 10,000 youth , estimate high 120 per 10,000 . Severity autistic feature easily define use different diagnostic tool compound ability lay clear cut definition . It , though , generally accept child autism normal IQ ( &gt; 70 ) `` high functioning '' regardless severity autistic feature . The investigator use term `` autism '' `` ASD '' interchangeably , term `` low functioning autism '' use describe child autism , presume , IQ &lt; 70 . The pathophysiology autism study extensively last decade . Abnormal neuronal connectivity implicate grow body research . In addition , area and/or neuronal activation detect functional MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) . Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) noninvasive technique allow affect brain activity . The pulse administer pass high current electromagnetic coil place adjacent patient 's scalp . The pulse induce electric field underlie brain tissue . When induced field certain threshold , direct appropriate orientation relative brain 's neuronal pathway , localize axonal depolarization produce , thus activate neuron relevant brain structure . rTMS studied individual high function autism . rTMS treatment found electrophysiological effect reduce repetitive behavior improve social functioning . In context exist pilot data suggest effect rTMS treatment individual high function autism , investigator propose pilot study assess efficacy rTMS child adolescent low function autism .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Male female outpatient 1019 year age . Although assume effect rTMS may great young child , secondary behavioral issue may less establish , study focus child old age 10 year 2 reason : . Some cooperation need child undergo rTMS treatment . ii . We would like establish efficacy safety profile treatment old child autism expose young child , may need sedation , . 2 . Meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , 4th Edition , Text Revision criterion . Children diagnosis ASD prior study give pediatric neurologist , child psychiatrist developmental pediatrician . Diagnosis confirm Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOSG ) Autism Diagnostic Interview ( ADIR ) 3 . VABSII score lowvery low range . This study recruit low functioning individual Autism . Although assessment tool ( i.e . ASRS ) standardize validated individual without intellectual disability , experience use tool child autism intellectual level . In addition , measure change time endorse diagnosis , feel use tools sufficient . 4 . Have normal physical examination . 5 . TAS ( Transcranial magnetic stimulation Safety Screen questionnaire ) negative mitigate per parent prior study . 1 . Patients born prior 37 week gestational age . 2 . Patients primary psychiatric diagnosis autism screen . 3 . Patients medical history neurological disease , include , limited , movement disorder , tuberous sclerosis , fragile X , know genetic syndrome , know abnormal MRI/structural lesion brain history traumatic brain injury . 4 . Patients medical history epilepsy/seizure disorder 5 . Patients family history epilepsy first degree relative ( parent sibling ) 6 . Patients medical condition autism 7 . Patients prescribed psychoactive medication ( ) less 4 week prior join study . 8 . Patients medical history head trauma associate prolonged loss consciousness . 9 . History metal foreign body head , exclude oral device 10 . History known anatomical brain abnormality 11 . Hearing loss 12. participation ongoing interventional study Discontinuation criterion : 1 .
