	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop real-time diagnostic technique e- Ab sensor influenza virus detection , investigator conduct prospective clinical study . In comparison result direct sequence influenza virus , investigator evaluate performance e- Ab sensor , include reproducibility , sensitivity , specificity , cross-reaction . The potential factor may interfere result would investigate . With technique , investigator hope make early diagnosis give influenza virus patient early treatment reduce complication case-fatality rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>e- Ab Sensor - Based Real-time Diagnosis Influenza Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since April 15 17 , 2009 , first two case novel influenza A ( H1N1 ) infection identify two southern California county , 12 March 2010 , virus spread 213 country overseas territory community cause death least 16713 people . Therefore , rapid diagnosis clinically necessary provide clinician rapid answer make early treatment possible reduce complication case-fatality rate . In addition , early diagnosis patient alert parent public health worker prevent contact earlier limit influenza spread . Electrosensing antibody probe system ( e- Ab sensing ) , develop rapid sensitive detection hapten , proteins viral antigen medical sample , use analyze interaction kinetics Q.anti-influenza-virus influenza virus antigen present flu patients'and normal sample . The system incorporate use engineer semiconductive antibody virus vertical lateral chip ( eVchip ) lateral flow ( eVsignal ) format . In electrosensing antibody probing , semiconductive antibody bound suitable electrosensing probe specifically selectively bind influenza-virus epitope target molecule test sample . The investigator evaluate performance e- Ab sensor , include reproducibility , sensitivity , specificity , cross-reaction . The potential factor may interfere result would investigate . e- Ab sensor threshold decision must maximize sensitivity . Therefore , threshold value test group find decision could 90 % sensitivity 90 % specificity . With technique , investigator hope make early diagnosis give influenza patient early treatment reduce complication case-fatality rate .</detailed_description>
