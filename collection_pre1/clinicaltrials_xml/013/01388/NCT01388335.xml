	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect enzastaurin ( LY317615 ) , protein ( enzyme CYP2C9 ) involve metabolic pathway warfarin patient solid tumor lymphomas . Information side effect may occur also collect . This drug interaction study treatment disease main purpose study . This Phase 1 , open label , fix sequence , 2 period study conduct patient solid tumor lymphomas . The duration participation study approximately 38 day include screening , patient allow continue receive enzastaurin . There plan duration extension phase study ; patient allow continue receive enzastaurin fulfil one criterion discontinuation , unacceptable toxicity disease progression .</brief_summary>

In addition , patient receive nonsteroidal antiandrogen therapy form bicalutamide discontinue therapy least 6 week prior study entry ( 4 week flutamide nilutamide ) . Have adequate organ function include : Bone Marrow Reserve : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.5 x 109/L prior treatment , platelet ≥100 x 109/L , hemoglobin ≥10 g/dL . Patients may receive erythrocyte transfusion achieve hemoglobin level discretion investigator . Patients may allow erythropoietin choice per standard care . Hepatic : bilirubin within 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , transaminases ≤2.5 time ULN ≤5 time ULN liver metastasis know . Renal : serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL . Electrolytes : Patients may enter study , investigator 's opinion electrolyte disorder , include potassium &lt; 3.4 mEq/L , calcium &lt; 8.4 mg/dL , magnesium &lt; 1.2 mEq/L , may appropriately manage stabilized time laboratory evaluation baseline day Period 1 . If electrolyte stabilize time , patient discontinue study . Coagulation : normal PT/INR aPTT Have estimate life expectancy , judgment investigator , permit patient complete drug interaction phase least 1 cycle safety extension phase ( patient participate safety extension ) Have receive treatment within 28 day initial dose study drug experimental agent noncancer indication receive regulatory approval indication Patients glioblastoma , Central Nervous System ( CNS ) metastases , hematologic malignancy lymphoma exclude study . Serious concomitant systemic disorder , include active infection , incompatible study ( discretion investigator ) History human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis B , hepatitis C infection Cardiac : Have serious cardiac condition , myocardial infarction within 6 month , angina , heart disease , define New York Heart Association Class III IV . Patients QTcB prolongation &gt; 450/470 msec ( males/females ) patient congenital longQTsyndrome family medical history exclude investigator 's discretion . Patients intraventricular conduction delay ( instance , right leave bundle branch block ) also exclude . It recommend patient baseline arrhythmia ( persistent paroxysmal ventricular supraventricular arrhythmia , include atrial fibrillation [ occasional premature atrial contraction [ APCs ] premature ventricular contraction [ PVCs ] acceptable ] bradycardia ( heart rate &lt; 50 ) exclude , investigator 's discretion . Known family history unexplained sudden death Personal history unexplained syncope within last year The use concomitant medication prolong QT/QTc interval Patients complete gastrectomy significant GI disease , investigator 's opinion , may significantly impact drug absorption Patients total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) Inability swallow tablet Women lactate Patients know allergy enzastaurin warfarin Patients warfarinrelated skin necrosis Patients know CYP2C9 poor intermediate metabolizers Drugs know inhibitor inducer CYP3A specifically exclude . Foods know inhibitor CYP3A ( example , grapefruit grapefruit juice Seville oranges Seville orange juice ) also specifically excluded Period 1 Period 2 study .
