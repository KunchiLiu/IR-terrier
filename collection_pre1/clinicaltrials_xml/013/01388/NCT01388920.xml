	<brief_summary>A significant proportion COPD subject experience muscle wasting , associate increased morbidity , impaired physical functioning , poor quality life . Muscle waste associate reduced muscle strength COPD subject . In particular , weakness peripheral muscle report play important role reduce functional capacity impair exercise performance . The primary objective study investigate effect tesamorelin , conjunction exercise training , lean body mass measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) scan .</brief_summary>
