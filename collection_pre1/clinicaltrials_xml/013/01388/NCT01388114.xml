	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation e- Ab Sensor - Based Real-time Diagnosis Serum Procalcitonin Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sepsis clinical syndrome complex interaction microorganism , host immune , inflammatory coagulation response . The mortality rate associate septic shock high , 40-70 % . Currently , diagnosis sepsis depend microbial infection systemic inflammatory response syndrome , lack sensitivity specificity . Accordingly , Society Critical Care Medicine ( SCCM ) offer new recommendation diagnosis sepsis 2001 , include serum level procalcitonin ( PCT ) . Increased PCT level clinical course correlate high mortality critically-ill patient . On hand , recent study also show PCT level could guide antibiotic treatment patient sepsis low respiratory tract infection . Besides usage sepsis population , serum PCT level could also use aid diagnosis bacterial infection guide antibiotic treatment acute exacerbation chronic obstructive airway disease . However , current method PCT assay depend Kryptor system develop BRAHMS , Germany , functional sensitivity 60 pg/mL . Each assay cost 1300 NT dollar , expensive serial follow-up serum PCT level . A real-time diagnostic technique e- Ab sensor serum PCT level measurement offer test low cost , increase applicability serum PCT level daily clinical practice . Here , investigator conduct study develop real-time diagnostic technique e- Ab sensor serum PCT level measurement patient sepsis .</detailed_description>
