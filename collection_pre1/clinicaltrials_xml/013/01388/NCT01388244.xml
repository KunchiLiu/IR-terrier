	<detailed_description>Osteoporosis highly prevalent especially postmenopausal woman . Approximately 46 % woman suffer least one osteoporotic fracture age 50 . The US Preventive Services Task Force ( USPSTF ) National Osteoporosis Foundation ( NOF ) recommend screen dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) woman age 65 year regardless risk factor . Nevertheless , use clinical risk factor show enhance risk-gradient accuracy fracture risk prediction . The FRAX risk assessment score derive large population-based cohort validate separate validation cohort . Its use risk assessment tool endorse WHO , prospective study examine effect screen programme use combination FRAX DXA two-step manner perform previously . 35,000 woman age 65-80 year select random population Region Southern Denmark —before inclusion—randomised either screen group control group . As first step , self- administer questionnaire regard risk factor osteoporosis base FRAX® issue group . As second step , subject screen group 10-year probability major osteoporotic fracture ≥15 % offer DXA scan . Patients diagnose osteoporosis DXA scan advise see GP discuss pharmaceutical treatment accord Danish National guideline . The primary outcome incident clinical fracture evaluate annual follow-up use Danish National Patient Registry . The secondary outcome cost-effectiveness , participation rate patient preference . The aim ROSE study investigate effectiveness two-step population base osteoporosis screen programme use FRAX® base self-administered questionnaire select woman DXA follow standard osteoporosis treatment accord national guideline deliver GPs Region Southern Denmark . Secondary aim clarify whether screen programme cost-effective ass patient ' preference , experience acceptance screen programme . Moreover , sub-studies allow assessment effectiveness FRAX® alone combine individual clinical risk factor prediction fracture impact socioeconomic factor participation outcome .</detailed_description>
