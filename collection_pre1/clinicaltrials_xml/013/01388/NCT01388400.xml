	<detailed_description>A . Scientific Background Stroke third lead cause death Western country upper limb ( UL ) sensorimotor dysfunction contribute significantly incidence physical disability handicap ( Olsen 1990 ) . One explanation poor arm recovery focus task accomplishment rather performance quality . This may reinforce alterative ( compensatory ) movement strategy instead encourage reappearance pre-morbid movement pattern ( recovery ) . Although rehabilitative goal recovery function , whether achieve true motor recovery compensation still debate . Indeed , patient severe impairment , compensation encourage maximize functional ability . Alternatively , good prognosis , motor recovery emphasize several reason . First , give appropriate training , recovery continue well chronic stage stroke ( e.g. , Michaelsen &amp; Levin 2004 ) . Second , compensation may assist immediate performance , may lead longer-term problem pain contracture ( Ada et al . 1994 ; Levin 1997 ) . Third , permit compensation could encourage learn nonuse limit capacity subsequent motor gain ( Allred et al . 2005 ) . While performance gain document repetitive training isolated movement ( e.g. , Whitall et al . 2000 ) , study address whether patient use explicit information optimize motor skill acquisition whether true behavioural recovery occurs . Points consider develop optimal training program learn occurs participant motivate , practice variety related task give relevant feedback ( Nudo &amp; Friel 1999 ; Winstein et al . 1999 ) . In addition , patient may benefit variable practice miss motor element recover ( Carr &amp; Shepherd 1987 ) motor relearn related physical cognitive impairment level ( Cirstea et al . 2006 ) . To date , study use clinical measure evaluate functional change ( e.g. , Jang et al . 2003 ) without consider movement perform . This study focus ability distinguish whether functional improvement result increase compensation true motor recovery . This do correlate functional improvement ( clinical measure ) change arm motor pattern detail movement analysis ( kinematics ) . Since large number possible kinematic indicator improvement , investigator need identify measure indicative change . This first step determination clinically meaningful outcome measure use randomize control trial effectiveness intervention . Clinical salience essential translate knowledge research study evidence-based practice ( van Peppen et al . 2007 ) . B . Study Design : 1 . Detailed Plan Study Two group 8 stroke subject participate A-B-A design data post-intervention ( within one week completion intervention ) follow-up ( one month completion intervention ) test compare data two pre-tests ( hold begin end first week study prior start intervention ) . Multiple clinical kinematic motor performance outcome measure determine one best describe arm motor recovery . This do comparing change outcomes train mean score 8 age- gender-matched healthy volunteer ( record single session ) . Stroke survivor practice movement two different train environment provide different level motivation feedback : Training Environment 1 create 2D video-based VR environment provide high motivation , Knowledge Results ( KR ) motor outcome ( i.e. , speed , precision ) non-specific Knowledge Performance ( KP ) feedback trunk movement . Environment 2 create physical environment provide KP feedback KR additional motivation . Training Protocol : After baseline evaluation ( physical &amp; cognitive ) , stroke group practice point 6 standardized target place beyond reach ( 12 trial per target ) acquisition phase 15 session space three week ( 3 sessions/wk , 72 trials/session ) . This practice regimen incorporate element necessary optimal motor learning : 1 ) Varied practice : Although movement new motor task , re-acquired stroke recovery . Our aim teach subject novel task identify movement perform sub-optimally may improve practice . 2 ) Intensive practice : The number repetition per session choose accord study Cirstea Levin ( 2000 ) . Thus , 72 trial per session ( 3 block 24 trial , 5 min rest block ) consider 'intensive ' practice , necessary element successful training program . Following acquisition phase , evaluation repeat 3mos evaluate retention transfer motor skill . 2 . Methods : Subjects Eight stroke subject per group recruit . They match age initial arm motor severity ( ± 5 pt Fugl-Meyer Arm Assessment ) . Eight age- sex-matched healthy subject recruit control group . Subject Recruitment : Patients recruit Haim Sheba Hospital discharge list use procedure place since 2005 . Screening do clinical research associate . Potential participant meet inclusion criterion 1-3 exclusion criterion send explanatory letter invite contact study investigator . Informed consent obtain participant . Control subject recruit community . Training Environments : Motivation Feedback : Training do Dept . Occupational Therapy locate Sheba Medical Center . Training environment allow u evaluate effect combine different degree motivation feedback motor outcome . Environment 1 highly motivate ( novel fun ) since training present game learner try beat score subsequent session . Targets present ball video-based VR system ( Gesture Xtreme ) . The patient sits front 36 inch display 6 target scene . The patient 's image capture video camera insert scene display monitor . The task point target appear random sequence . Feedback provide pertinent information motor learning ( KR , KP , game score ) . Environment 2 incorporates number disposition target Env . 1 presented physical environment wooden frame front subject . KR KP feedback provide verbal cue experimenter do usually clinic . However , additional motivational information ( game score ) . Preliminary Outcome Measures : Clinical Before train stroke group , blind evaluator measure clinical score arm motor impairment function ( Fugl-Meyer Arm Score , Reaching Performance Scale , Box Blocks test , Wolf Motor Function Test , Motor Activity Log ) well cognitive function . All test valid reliable regularly use clinical practice . Kinematic testing : Test Task Transfer Task : The investigator also record kinematic outcome measure characterize arm trunk movement reach ( elbow extension , shoulder horizontal adduction , shoulder flexion , scapular movement , trunk displacement ) . Our aim focus segmental joint kinematics Test Transfer Task consist reach movement . Test Task record . The Test target place line patient 's sternum distance beyond subject 's arm length . The Test Task similar movement make one practiced target . To assess motor learning , investigator determine element learn one task transfer similar task . Thus , investigator also assess movement make Transfer Task , target place front ipsilateral shoulder 5 centimeter ( cm ) high topmost row train target . The Transfer Task therefore new movement , practice training . Rigid body segmental kinematics record set 4 passive reflective marker ( 0.5 cm diameter sphere ) attach trunk , upper arm forearm segment . This enable computation three translational three rotational degree freedom per segment . Joint kinematics collect marker fix sternum , acromion , elbow wrist via exo-skeletal frame . Marker motion record calibrate 3 camera opto-electronic motion-capture system ( ProReflex MCU-240 , Qualisys ) suitable computer software ( Qualisys , Göteborg , Swe ) . Data collection ( 100 Hertz , 2-5 second ) trigger movement hand central position release mechanical switch . The accuracy measurement marker within error &lt; 0.2 cm . As first step , investigator determine movement time , accuracy , smoothness , segment joint rotation main component multi-joint coordination . Cartesian coordinate ( x , , z ) segment obtain segmental marker set . Raw data least three marker per segment use interpolation miss marker ( 5th-order polynomial ) . For trial , movement time peak velocity determine endpoint tangential velocity trace . Movement time time point tangential velocity exceed remain 5 % maximum return remain level . Movement accuracy term constant extent error compute mean distance ( ) final endpoint position ( x , , z ) position target ( x0 , y0 , z0 ) . Constant variable ( SD ) directional error also define . Movement smoothness compute tangential velocity trace use index curvature ( ratio endpoint path length length straight line join initial final position ) number peaks trajectory path . For segment joint rotation , vector calculate within reference coordinate system upper forearm segment . From result segment centroid motion segment rotation data different outcome variable calculate . The relevant one define change performance respect endpoint motion respect whole-arm posture , particularly , evolution movement time ( time derivative ) fragmentation segmental path posture arm move towards different target . Additional aspect movement explore order find appropriate descriptor arm motor performance change propose clinical intervention . Change score calculate subject determine Index Improvement ( IP ) Index Learning ( IL ) . The IP define change variable ratio post- pre-test value . An IP 1 indicates change whereas negative positive value indicate value decrease increase respectively . For variable , positive ratio indicate improvement ( endpoint velocity , endpoint smoothness , angle measure , phase amplitude ) others , improvement demonstrate negative ratio ( movement time , movement precision ) . The IL , use determine subject retain improvement train follow-up epoch , define change variable retention- compare post-test . IL value 1 indicate improvement maintain ( change ) , negative value parameter decrease positive value parameter increase . Statistical analysis : For first aim , change outcome measure determine compare movement outcome acquisition retention phase two-repeated measure mixed design ANOVA ( MANOVA ) compare raw mean ( Time 1 , Time 2 , Time 3 , Time 4 ) change score ( IP , IL ) group . The investigator determine kinematic measure undergo change thus may indicative motor recovery ( e.g. , increase elbow and/or shoulder movement , decrease trunk movement ) investigate measure different train group . The investigator expect change group training Environment I great group train Environment 2 .</detailed_description>
