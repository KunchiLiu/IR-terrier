	<detailed_description>In order form sample child read difficulty , primary school teacher ten public school city Sao Paulo first ask suggest name child average reading ability . From suggest name , teacher give `` scale reading skill '' considers children´s silent oral reading generates score divide child four skill level child bad indicator select ( i.e. , student read less student read poorly ) . Then , second evaluation phase conduct child read difficulty : phase hear speech pathologist conduct Simplified Assessment Central Auditory Processing order evaluate auditory function , ophthalmologist evaluate visual acuity use Snellen Scale psychologist evaluate non-verbal intelligence use Raven 's Progressive Matrices . These three evaluation do individually , previously reserve room school ( loco ) school hour previously establish administration teach staff . Only score 25th percentile Ravens´s Progressive Matrices consider exclusion criterion ; others variables two cite enter control variable . It decide group three initial evaluation together , simpler conduct quickly . In next step , evaluate outcome type covariates child 's level ( i.e. , musical ability , socio-demographic characteristic , familiar background ) . At end first wave outcome evaluation , intervention initiate school previously randomly select intervention . The study provide block flute , keyboard two musical teacher per school ( two teacher 27 child school select intervention ) . The musical educator follow syllabus program order avoid educational bias control process teaching , make class similar possible . Every two week intervention , ten music educator call order review educational methodological plan share positive negative experience obtain teach process .</detailed_description>
