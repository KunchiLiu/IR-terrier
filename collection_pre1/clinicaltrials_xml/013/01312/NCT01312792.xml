	<detailed_description>The IMCI implement Bangladesh 2001 . Bangladesh adapt generic IMCI clinical guideline recommend child one danger sign , severe condition , identify health worker first level facility refer urgently . Although quality care achieve ten IMCI facility Matlab , Bangladesh assess high ( El Arifeen 2004 ) rate compliance referral find low . In 2002-03 compliance rate less 37 % decrease 17 % end 2003 ( El Arifeen S , unpublished data ) . In many setting , child refer actually attend hospital , severely limit appropriate care . This mainly high level facility geographically inaccessible ; financial social constraint also prevent care giver comply referral advice . The Govt Bangladesh presently plan modify current IMCI guideline . The modified guideline recommend treatment severe pneumonia case without danger sign unless another severe classification do first level facility . In 2004 Govt . Bangladesh collaboration ICCDR , B carry pilot study rural Bangladesh ( Chowdhury , El Arifeen et al . 2008 ) ass safety effectiveness modify IMCI clinical management guideline child severe pneumonia age 2months - 5 year . The study conclude appropriate management severe pneumonia local level could save life represent major cost decrease reduction referral , treatment admission cost . Another research conduct Pakistan , randomize equivalency trial reveal community management pneumonia home treatment high-dose oral amoxicillin effective current hospital base treatment severe pneumonia ( Hazir et al . 2008 ) . Although finding encourage , none study really focus immediate outcome IMCI improve care seek , adherence health provider household caregiver algorithmic protocol understand barrier facilitator use protocol . Moreover , study conduct control research setting therefore provide adequate understanding challenge potential implementing IMCI routine health system . So need carry research actual community setting understand component modify guideline work 'real life situation ' take account challenge constraint face health system develop country like Bangladesh . The primary objective study assess adherence service provider modify IMCI guideline manage severe pneumonia among under-5 child care-givers ' compliance referral advice give health provider initial care-seeking under-5 child severe pneumonia . The secondary objective measure result change care-seeking pattern childhood pneumonia due introduction modify IMCI guideline Two MNCS programme upazilas purposively select study consultation GoB partner . The likely district two upazilas select Sherpur Gopalganj . Twenty union ( average population 20,000 ) identify select upazilas randomly assign intervention comparison arm . The intervention evaluation continue 15 month . This cluster randomize trial . Of 20 select study union , 10 union randomly assign intervention 10 comparison , , 200,000 population ( ~40,000 household ) arm . Each geographically delimit union Union Health Family Welfare Centre ( UHFWC ) family welfare centre ( FWC ) , service population reside within . Health provider intervention arm train regard modification IMCI guideline . The training address aspect IMCI Training . Training standard IMCI guideline give health provider arm , receive . Figure 1 ( source : Chowdhury et al 2008 ) describe modified standard IMCI guideline . Under modified guideline sick child age 2-59 month severe pneumonia refer accompanies danger sign , stridor sign symptom severe classification . All child severe pneumonia treat first level health facility oral antibiotic ( amoxicillin ) . The union belong comparison arm continue follow standard IMCI guideline . To measure outcome intervention , study involve follow method : Health facility survey include health provider ' survey ; extraction review health facility service record provider compliance ; routine surveillance collection information care-seeking childhood pneumonia ; track structure interview severe pneumonia case see facility Details MNCS intervention package delivery system find Annex I . All MNCS upazilas also already implement facility-based IMCI . All drug study protocol list drug Bangladesh Government . The Study ensure adequate timely supply drug minimum essential logistics health facility study area . The health facility monitor ongoing basis field supervisor , visit facility month .</detailed_description>
