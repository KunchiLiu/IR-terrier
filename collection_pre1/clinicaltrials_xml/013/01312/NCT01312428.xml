	<brief_title>Pelvic Alignment Level ( PAL ) Instrument Evaluation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total hip replacement ( THR ) sucessful treatment case degenerative joint disease . However , post operative complication dislocation , osteolysis , component wear migration still concern . It note scientific literature precise acetabular cup position help reduce post operative complication . The Pelvic Alignment Level ( PAL ) offer solution assess pelvic motion optimize implant position without need intra-operative fluoroscopy large capital expenditure . The focus study evaluate clinical outcome ( acetabular cup placement , femoral offset , leg length ) use PAL instrument without use PAL instrument total hip replacement . This prospective , post market , randomize multi-center clinical study .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient sign IRB approve , evaluation specific Informed Patient Consent Form . Patient male nonpregnant female age 18 year old time enrollment .
