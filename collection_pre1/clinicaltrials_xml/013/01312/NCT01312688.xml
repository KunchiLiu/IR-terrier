	<brief_summary>The cardiovascular system play central role pathophysiology prognosis sepsis , yet correct hemodynamic management septic patient still vigorously debate . Despite guideline , use CVP PAOP seriously criticize inaccurate prediction fluid requirement . Recently study show early goal-directed therapy ( EGDT ) aim achieve ScvO2 ≥70 % significantly improve survival septic shock patient , yet EGDT adopt intensivists . The investigator recently find use 2D echocardiography 262 patient severe sepsis septic shock treat conventional guideline ( without ScvO2 ) diastolic dysfunction reduce stroke volume index strong independent predictor mortality . In present study investigator intend test effect EGDT resuscitation , long term myocardial function leave ventricular volume survival ICU patient severe sepsis septic shock . Patients randomized EGDT ( resuscitation direct ScvO2 ) standard therapy first six hour diagnosis severe sepsis septic shock admission ICU . After six hour patient septic shock monitor non invasive cardiac output ( PiCCO , Pulsion Technologies ) . All patient follow daily 2D &amp; 3D transthoracic echocardiography detail measurement systolic diastolic leave right ventricular volume function . Patients EGDT group compare control group parameter initial resuscitation ( fluid volume , ScvO2 achieve , inotrope use ) , initial value non invasive cardiac output six hour , intervention require institution non invasive cardiac output , early long term effect cardiac function volume echo measurement , mortality . The effectiveness EGDT thus examine short long term .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Prospective randomized control trial , approve ( submit approval ) Institutional Review Board . Over period 2 year , 300 patient severe sepsis septic shock randomize either currently accept standard hemodynamic treatment ICU standard plus goal-directed therapy accord Rivers protocol SSC guideline , i.e . include addition ScvO2 measurement consequently derive treatment achieve ScvO2 ≥70 % first 6 hour appearance sepsis septic shock ICU ( Fig . 2 ) . After first 6 hour patient septic shock ( 62 % patient accord preliminary data ) monitor continuous cardiac output monitoring . Additionally , patient follow daily transthoracic echocardiography 19 5 day ( Fig 3 ) . Since patient able sign inform consent , inclusion study approve attend physician charge ICU also able decide stop study protocol time accord clinical judgment best interest patient .</detailed_description>
