	<brief_summary>This purpose study 1 . Determine change endothelial dependent vascular reactivity vascular property 2 . Determine change monocyte activation 3 . Determine change pro-inflammatory status 4 . Investigate effect six-month CPAP therapy change patient OSA</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endothelial Dysfunction , Monocyte Activation , Vasculopathy Patients With Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) Effect 6-month CPAP Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , characterize chronic intermittent hypoxia ( CIH ) sleep fragmentation , associate three-fold high risk cardiovascular event . CIH could promote production ROS induce adhesion circulate monocyte , endothelium injury , production pro-inflammatory mediator adhesion molecule lead formation atherosclerotic plaque . Recent study show vascular endothelium function could noninvasively assess Flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) brachial artery , whereas OSA patient low FMD compare control subject . However , CPAP effect vascular function conflict result . Conflicts usually involve small sample size , lack appropriate control , inadequate control confound factor , like physical activity , duration CPAP treatment . Also , CPAP effect monocytes activation inflammatory mediator clear well . Our previous study show 12-week CPAP treatment could modify level TNF-Î± hsCRP . However , 12-week treatment may long enough draw conclusion benefit long-term CPAP therapy . Therefore , plan conduct cross-sectional follow double blind , randomize , placebo-control , parallel-group interventional study prove hypothesis OSA lead endothelial dysfunction , monocytes activation , pro-inflammatory state lead vasculopathy change revert CPAP .</detailed_description>
