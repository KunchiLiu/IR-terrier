	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study assess ability scopolamine improve antidepressant effect ECT determine whether scopolamine shorten time response remission patient receive ECT . The hypothesis : 1 . Patients receive ECT plus scopolamine great improvement depression symptom receive ECT plus placebo . 2 . Patients receive scopolamine addition ECT require few ECT treatment obtain response/remission compare group receive ECT plus placebo . 3 . Time response remission scopolamine group significantly short compare ECT alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Use IV Scopolamine Augment Efficacy Electroconvulsive Therapy ( ECT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) highly effective treatment severe major depression . It estimate approximately 10 percent patient admit hospital treatment major depressive disorder receive ECT . However , patient receive ECT respond , , achieve remission . Furthermore , wide range number ECT treatments do among people depression , average approximately eight treatment . Because treatment usually do three time per week ( Monday , Wednesday , Friday ) , minimal length stay average person receive inpatient ECT typically great two week . Finally , ECT without risk , every round ECT incur additional risk treatment , also risk general anesthesia . Thus , although ECT robust mode treatment Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) , remain need improve treatment efficacy speed onset . Improving efficacy ECT would benefit individual MDD , also far-reaching effect health care system could impact cost resource utilize . Ideally , agent could add augment effect ECT , term efficacy well speed onset . In 2006 , Furrey et al , report rapid antidepressant effect antimuscarinic drug , scopolamine , deliver parenterally . Significant antidepressant effect find first scopolamine administration . The improvement report immediately follow first IV administration , increase across treatment , sustain placebo crossover period . Scopolamine anticholinergic muscarinic agent , activity CNS pilot data suggest significant impact rapidly improve depressive symptom patient MDD , administer IV . Thus , serve reasonable choice augment effect ECT treatment patient MDD . Primary Aim 1 ) Assess ability scopolamine augment antidepressant effect ECT . Hypothesis 1a : Patients receive ECT plus scopolamine significantly great mean improvement total HAM-D score baseline endpoint receive ECT plus placebo . Hypothesis 1b : Patients receive scopolamine addition ECT require few mean ECT treatment obtain response/remission compare group receive ECT plus placebo . Primary Aim 2 ) Evaluate hypothesis scopolamine shorten time response remission patient receive ECT . Hypothesis 2 : Time response remission Scopolamine group significantly short compare ECT alone . Secondary Aim : Provide evidence tolerability intravenous scopolamine administer ECT . Hypothesis 3a : There group difference ( ECT plus scopolamine v ECT plus placebo ) mean number ECT session withhold due cognitive impairment ( determined attend psychiatrist ) . Hypothesis 3b : There group difference ( ECT plus scopolamine v ECT plus placebo ) regard mean number moderate severe side effect . Hypothesis 3c : There significant difference scopolamine plus ECT group placebo plus ECT group mean level physiological measure ECT include : heart rate , blood pressure , seizure length , duration muscle paralysis , duration asystole , energy need induce seizure . Exploratory Analyses : ass whether scopolamine plus ECT group short average length stay inpatient psychiatric unit compare receive ECT plus placebo . We also assess whether scopolamine plus ECT group significant difference cognitive measure endpoint compare receiving ECT plus placebo .</detailed_description>
