	<brief_summary>Since implementation universal vaccination 1984 , chronic HBV carier rate general population reduce 15-20 % , &lt; 1 % post-vaccination population . However , child bear HBeAg positive mother still may infect HBV despite immunization . To reduce HBV infection people , strategy reduce infection rate high risk group mandatory . Previous small scale study use lamivudine treatment pregnant woman third trimester prove effective reduce child infection rate . The aims present study conduct clinical trial use Tenofovir ( category B ) reduce mother-to-infant transmission , monitor hepaitits B viral status mother hepatitis occurrence . The clinical trial screen case HBsAg positive pregnant woman age 20 40 year gestational 20-32 week . They test HBsAg HBeAg . In marker positive , HBV viral load test . An estimated 180 pregnant woman high HBV viral load ( &gt; 10^8 copies/mL ) recruit study ; include 80-100 subject treat Tenofovir 300 mg daily start 30-32 week gestation ( 3rd trimester ) continue 1 month delivery ; 80-100 pregnant woman enrol control drug give mother . The newborn baby give HBIG within 24 hour delivery , HBV vaccines 0 , 1 6 month . Maternal complete blood count ( CBC ) data test first prenatal examination record . Plasma AST、ALT level HBV DNA test Tenofovir treatment , 1 month treatment , time delivery , 1 , 2 , 4 6 month delivery . HBsAg、HBeAg、anti-HBs AST、ALT test child day 1 , 6 moth 1 year birth . The primary outcome reduction HBsAg carrier rate child 6 month age . The secondary outcome HBsAg carrier rate child 12 month age , change liver function , HBeAg , viral load pregnant mother treatment . A follow-up study investigate safety mother child expose maternal tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) pregnancy reduce mother-to-infant hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) transmission conduct . The follow-up study include mother-children pair 2-4 year delivery child .</brief_summary>
