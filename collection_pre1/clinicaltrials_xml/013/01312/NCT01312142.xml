Tracheostomy become increasingly common intervention ICUs , especially patient prolong mechanical ventilator support . Tracheostomy may reduce work breathe improve aspect pulmonary mechanic , reduce dead space decrease airway resistance , date , evidence link reduction weaning time length stay . The investigator believe improvement pulmonary mechanic , may reflect wean parameter respiratory therapist measure wean program , may different measure tracheostomy creation . The investigator therefore hypothesize improvement pulmonary mechanic patient wean failure tracheostomy may reflect wean parameter , improvement may able predict subsequent successful wean mechanical ventilator support .

	<detailed_description>Weaning mechanical ventilator essential element care critically ill intubated patient receive mechanical ventilation . It cover entire process liberate patient mechanical support endotracheal tube1 . The process wean involve two-step strategy : 1 . Assessment readiness weaning , include physiological measurement , maximum inspiratory pressure , tidal volume , respiratory rate etc . 2 . Spontaneous breathe trial . The incidence successful weaning estimate around 68.8 % . Despite consensus optimal timing tracheostomy , patient prolong trans-laryngeal intubation finally succumb tracheostomy , prolong trans-laryngeal intubation cause tissue trauma , promote bacterial translocation infection , make tracheostomy increasingly common intervention ICUs . Meanwhile , tracheostomy may reduce work breathe improve aspect pulmonary mechanic , reduce dead space decrease airway resistance , date , evidence link reduction weaning time length stay . Ｗe believe improvement pulmonary mechanic , may reflect wean parameter respiratory therapist measure wean program , may different tracheostomy creation , especially patient weaning failure . Ｗe therefore hypothesize may improvement pulmonary mechanic patient wean failure tracheostomy , improvement may able predict subsequent successful wean mechanical ventilator support . Hereby investigator perform prospective single-center study investigate change wean parameter wean failure patient tracheostomy predictor successful weaning .</detailed_description>
