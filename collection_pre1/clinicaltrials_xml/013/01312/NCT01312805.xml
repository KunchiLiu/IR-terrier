	<detailed_description>Objectives : Improve physician adherence four recommendation NHLBI asthma treatment guideline : 1 . Improve case detection asthma among patient pulmonary symptom , 2 . Grade asthma patient asthma , identify persistent versus intermittent asthma , 3 . Improve rate use controller medication - particularly inhaled steroid - among patient persistent asthma , 4 . Provide asthma treatment plan asthma patient . Design : This randomize controlled trial . Patients register appointment PCC Pediatric clinic randomize intervention control arm . Patients intervention arm , physician see , receive full intervention . Patients control arm receive usual care . Intervention : The CHICA computer system regular use PCC Pediatrics clinic since November 4 , 2004 . At patient check-in , CHICA produce health survey parent complete weighting room . The survey scan CHICA physician encounter . CHICA produce worksheet physician include prompt reminder base date health survey electronic medical record . The completer worksheet scan back CHICA . Intervention control group continue use system In intervention group , CHICA include question ask presence asthma asthma symptom health survey . If family respond asthma symptom asthma present , CHICA : 1 . Alert physician ask confirm deny presence asthma rate asthma persistent intermittent , 2 . Generate chart show criterion asthma grade , 3 . Recommend controller medication patient persistent asthma ask physician document controller prescribe , 4 . Generate partially complete treatment plan physician complete give patient . For patient confirm asthma , CHICA place question health survey subsequent visit assess symptom . For patient prescribe controller medication , CHICA put question health survey ask patient adherence medication . The physician worksheet alert physician change patient 's symptom status non-adherence controller medication , compliance NHLBI guideline . Outcome Measures : To determine rate asthma case find intervention control group , pull RMRS electronic record patient see first 6 month trial determine prevalence diagnosis asthma ( ICD-9 code equal 493.* ) . After 6 month run trial , randomly select patient trial ICD-9 diagnosis asthma ( 493 . * ) , 75 patient intervention group 75 patient control group . The paper `` shadow '' chart patient pull chart room PCC Pediatrics clinic . Trained chart reviewer document follow : 1 . Has patient 's asthma grade intermittent persistent ? 2 . Is documentation asthma treatment plan ? 3 . Has patient prescribe controller medication ?</detailed_description>
