	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II randomize study subject recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer determine feasibility safety well immunogenicity OC-L , autologous vaccine comprise autologous Oxidized tumor Cell Lysate ( OC-L ) administer intradermal/subcutaneous injection combination Ampligen ( poly-l : poly-C12U ) , Toll-like receptor 3 agonist . Study duration 24 month . This study two Phases eligible subject enrol Phase 1 receive OC-L admix Montanide ISA 51 intravenous Ampligen . Subjects enrol Phase II randomize two ARMS . This randomized design allow unbiased evaluation comparison immune response among 2 treatment arm . patient randomize ( 10 per treatment arm ) block size 4 6 , treatment assignment balance group 4 6 patient randomize . ARM A 10 patient receive OC-L . Arm b 10 patient receive OC-L Ampligen . Following vaccination , subject Phase I Arm B give intravenous Ampligen 3 time start 2-3 day vaccine administration . All subject receive vaccine Day 0 , 14 , 28 , 42 56 . Subjects receive Prevnar day 0 day 14 . Subjects treat till exhaustion OC-L disease progression whichever occur first subject contact every 6 month 5 year annually survival . The OC-L study product manufacture quality test Cell Vaccine Production Facility release IDS , admix Montanide ISA 51 VG day vaccination .</detailed_description>
