	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize everolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy combine rituximab induction could provide comparable safety profile renal transplant patient , compare standard immunosuppressive therapy use thymoglobulin induction , tacrolimus , mycophenolate mofetil steroid , term acute rejection rate renal function . Rituximab report reverse refractory acute kidney transplant rejection . Combined immunoadsorption without IVIG , rituximab could successfully prevent antibody-mediated rejection ABO-incompatible renal transplantation . This study ass whether CNI-free regimen include B-cell depleting antibody induction , everolimus MMF result comparable long-term function without negative impact safety efficacy immunosuppression . This study open-label two-arm randomize ( 2:1 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>De Novo Everolimus-based Therapy Renal Transplantation Using Rituximab Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients study arm ( 2/3 patient ) receive rituximab ( 375mg/m2 ) induction subsequently everolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy . The control arm ( 1/3 patient ) receive thymoglobulin induction tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy . Everolimus give initial dose 1 mg bid within 24 hrs reperfusion , adjust target trough blood level 6-10 ng/ml first 6 month transplantation . The control arm ( 1/3 patient ) receive thymoglobulin induction tacrolimus-based immunosuppressive therapy . The dose thymoglobulin would 1.0mg/kg/d 3 days25 . The first dose thymoglobulin administer graft kidney reperfusion , rituximab . All patient receive corticosteroid therapy usual . The initial daily dose tacrolimus 0.15 mg/kg/d give two dos start within 24 hour transplantation . The dos tacrolimus adjust target whole blood trough level 8 12 ng/ml first 30 day transplantation , taper 6 10 ng/ml 6 month . All patient receive mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) start 2 g/d divide dos , adjust maintain WBC 4000~6000/mm3 . All patient enter study receive co-trimoxazole prophylactic medication least 12 week post-operatively . Valgancyclovir give anti-viral prophylaxis . During transplant operation , renal biopsy perform vascular perfusion baseline pathology , follow-up biopsy schedule 2 year transplantation . The primary endpoint incidence acute rejection , secondary endpoint include renal function , graft patient survival . Male female adult patient receive renal transplantation may enter study . The intention enroll 90 patient fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion study . Sixty patient receive rituximab everolimus-based therapy , thirty patient receive thymoglobulin tacrolimus-based therapy .</detailed_description>
