	<brief_title>Study Tolerability Exelon Patch ( Rivastigmine ) Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A once-daily Exelon patch recently develop reduce GI side effect rivastigmine make application easy day . Thinking patch first-line drug , proven safe long time . The safety clinical effect Exelon patch test many study . However , study conduct Western country study period year . There data Exelon patch relate ethnic Asian patient Alzheimer 's disease . Especially , many different environmental factor Western Asia country , habitual climate factor , skin type behavioral style may influence patch durability . The aim study evaluate durability Exelon patch Korean patient Alzheimer 's disease factor influence durability . Also evaluate significance factor give u way increase patch durability . Thirty patient per investigational center enrol 6 month . Probable mild moderate AD patient include whether depression neurological symptom disease . The period study 6 month , start treatment start Exelon patch 5cm2 . After 4 week , dose titration attempt Exelon patch 10cm2 . If patient reporting much discomfort stick high dose patch , investigator assess severity side effect follow adjust dose consider discontinuation . Cognitive , functional , global outcome measure obtain baseline end month 6 . Environmental factor include caregiver condition , participant 's habitat type , participant 's skin type , etc . also evaluate first visit , assess every visit . Participants caregiver ask possible concern problem associate patch use every visit . And visible problem adverse event , take picture uploaded investigation web site study . Finally , primary endpoint , participant discontinue prematurely evaluate every visit . Signs skin irritation site patch application assess every visit investigator use skin irritation rating scale . Caregivers evaluate patch adhesion throughout study rating provide accordance patch adhesion score system . To assess factor influence skin irritation adverse event , classify skin type participant use `` skin type measure paper '' first visit time . We search personal family history allergy , characteristic participant 's habitat use questionnaire . The information caregiver include his/her condition base annual income , live status , education level . To see specific allergic factor discontinuation , investigate participant 's allergy history completely thoroughly .</detailed_description>
