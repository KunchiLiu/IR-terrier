	<detailed_description>This phase-I clinical trial determine feasibility safety cyclophosphamide/fludarabine lymphodepletion immunomodulatory combination Interferon-alpha ( INF-a ) , Bevacizumab Aspirin , follow adoptive transfer vaccine-primed , ex vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated peripheral blood autologous T-cells , vaccination whole tumor vaccine , administer intradermally combination Bevacizumab patient recurrent ovarian cancer , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer previously underwent induction vaccination whole tumor vaccine . Subjects receive T-lymphocytes infusion dose 20 billion ± 20 % cell patient . Subjects cant meet target dose level still enroll analyze separately . Before T-cell infusion , subject undergo lymphodepletion single course outpatient high-dose lymphodepleting chemotherapy intravenous cyclophosphamide ( 300 mg/m2/d 3 consecutive Days ) intravenous fludarabine ( 30 mg/m2/d 3 consecutive Days Days -5 -3 ) . Subjects enrol study receive immunomodulatory cycle ( Bevacizumab Aspirin ) ~14 Days apheresis ( frozen apheresis product previous collection ) another cycle apheresis T-cell infusion ( approx . Day -20 Day -7 , ( +/- 5 Days ) ) . The immunomodulatory cycle consist follow : intravenous 10 mg/kg Bevacizumab Day -35 , Day -20 ( +/- 5 Days ) , 325 mg Enteric Coated Aspirin orally start Day -35 14 Days start Day -20 14 Days . They also receive three subcutaneous injection Interferon-alpha ( Intron®a 2b ) ( INF-a ) ( subject option self administer Interferon-alpha provide instruction ) dose 5 MIU Days -3 , -2 -1 . EX vivo CD3/CD28-costimulated lymphocyte infuse ~1-2 Days last Day interferon-alpha treatment , ideally Day 0 . All subject receive dose 5-10 million cell OC-DC vaccine intradermally , OC-L ( 2.5-5x106 oxidize tumor cell admixed Montanide ISA 51 VG ) 2-3 Days post T-cell infusion Day 16-18 . Subjects start receive Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg vaccine ( available ) start Day 30 every 3 week thereafter end study . ( Funding Source - FDA OOPD )</detailed_description>
