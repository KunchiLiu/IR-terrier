	<brief_title>Does Acute Oxytocin Administration Enhance Social Cognition Individuals With Schizophrenia ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia characterize presence positive symptom ( delusion , hallucination , disorganization think process behavior ) well negative symptom ( blunt affect , alogia , avolition ) , neurocognitive deficit , impaired social cognition . While positive symptom often respond well antipsychotic medication , latter symptom difficult treat . In study , focus social cognition , define function engage social interaction . Social cognition categorize four main domain : theory mind , social perception , attributional bias , emotional processing . Social cognition patient schizophrenia find critical predicting multiple aspect community functioning . There currently two broad approach improve social cognition patient schizophrenia : pharmacological psychosocial intervention . While psychosocial intervention ( train exercise target improvement domains social cognition ) show benefit , resultant improvement limited distribution across multiple domain well generalization improve functioning community . Pharmacological trial yield mixed result , currently available medication consistently find improve social cognition patient schizophrenia2 . One potential future therapeutic target enhance social cognition oxytocin system . Oxytocin nine-amino acid peptide , addition role periphery regulate lactation uterine contraction , function centrally neurotransmitter involved multiple aspect social behavior related emotion . Specifically , find modulate emotion recognition , trust , eye contact , empathic accuracy , well envy gloat . Given oxytocin 's role social functioning , conjunction deficit social function find frequently individual schizophrenia , several study past three decade examine oxytocin system human schizophrenia rodent experimental model . It find individual schizophrenia show level increase oxytocin normal control response trust-related interpersonal interaction , low plasma oxytocin predict negative symptom schizophrenia . Additionally , also find plasma oxytocin level predict ability patient schizophrenia identify facial expression . Finally , find recently sustain regular administration intranasal oxytocin significantly reduce positive negative symptom schizophrenia . Thus , significant evidence support research study effect oxytocin social cognition . It yet know exogenous administration oxytocin acute effect neuropsychological measure social cognition individual schizophrenia , focus propose pilot study . The overall hypothesis guiding study acute oxytocin administration improve social cognition ( assess composite score comprise two measure `` low level '' social cognitive process two measure `` high level '' social cognitive process ) individual schizophrenia . Our primary goal assess feasibility experimental paradigm generate pilot data obtain estimate effect size use plan future large study .</detailed_description>
