	<brief_title>Effects Flavonoids Cognitive Performance Healthy Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There recently increase interest potential flavonoid , plant derive compound find food fruit vegetable , ameliorate age-related cognitive decline . Research suggest flavonoid improve memory learning , possibly result anti-oxidant , anti-inflammatory neuroprotective effect example increase cerebral blood flow , protect vulnerable neuron , enhance exist neuronal function stimulate neuronal function . The research initially involve randomise cross-over human dietary intervention trial use two flavonoid-rich drink ( flavanone-rich flavanone-poor ) investigate change cerebral blood flow young adult ( n=6 ; age range 18-30 year ) . Changes cognitive performance measure serum BDNF level investigate second randomise cross-over trial use intervention drink show great effect cerebral blood flow young adult ( n=24 ; age range 18-30 year ) use range sensitive test executive function . The study design measure acute effect type flavonoid supplementation , well primary cognitive outcome , assess flavonoid/metabolite BDNF ( brain-derived neurotrophic factor ) level blood change vascular reactivity .</detailed_description>
