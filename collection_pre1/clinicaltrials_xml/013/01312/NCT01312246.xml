	<detailed_description>Introduction Multiple new cautery device use perform quicker safer surgery . These device able seal vessel without need tie adjunct maneuver produce minimal thermal spread adjacent tissue . We find EnSeal reliable , versatile , effective device seal vessel . Currently , EnSeal approve vessel large 7 mm diameter . We believe , base prior clinical experience , EnSeal safely seal vessel large diameter . Current data show burst pressure obtain 7 mm vessel five time physiological normal pressure animal models.1 , 2 We demonstrate mesenteric vessel encounter human colectomy safely divide EnSeal . However , neither researcher measure bursting pressure seal human patient . We propose examine bursting pressure vessel take colectomies ex-vivo fashion . After use EnSeal divide inferior mesenteric artery origin , use ass bursting pressure seal . We similarly assess inferior mesenteric vein . We measure diameter vessel in-vivo ex-vivo . Finally , conduct histopathological examination seal vessel determine effect EnSeal device structure vessel . Background With increased preference laparoscopic surgery , new instrument need safely replicate , possible , improve upon technique use open surgery . Visualization eminently important dependent multiple factor , include bleed smoke coagulation cautery . Therefore , high demand device safely coagulate tissue low heat little smoke . Resection tissue safe haemostatic fashion laparoscopic colorectal surgery depend upon good control mesenteric vessel . Ideally , thermal spread minimal travel predictable pattern . Various new device create used purpose vessel seal , popular Ligasure ( Valleylab ) , Harmonic ( Ethicon ) , Gyrus ( Gyrus ACMI ) , EnSeal ( Ethicon ) . Multi-purpose instrument preferable surgeon avoid frequent exchange instrument thus reduce operative time . The previously mention vessel-sealing device work two jaw also use manipulate tissue . Of particular interest group colorectal surgeon find along decrease operative time , device show contribute decrease blood loss laparoscopic colectomies.3 These modern vessel-sealing device work vary method . The Harmonic Scalpel ultrasonic shear break hydrogen bond cause tissue coagulation vessel sealing.4 The Ligasure device work coagulate tissue jaw device high-current/low-voltage flow use high-pressure jaw seal it.5 The nano-particle technology EnSeal device aim low temperature instrument minimize heat transfer adjacent tissue allow different temperature within different part jaw . It turn collagen denatures , approximately 100 degree Celsius.6 These seal system widely use many surgical discipline surgeon continue try find new us innovative device . They compare conventional method clip tie find effective applied properly.7 The Gyrus PK system use urological robotic surgery.8 , 9 The Harmonic Scalpel use major abdominal operation also otolaryngology operations.10 , 11 Ligasure perhaps widely adopt used gynecological , otolaryngology , colorectal specialties.12-15 The EnSeal device newer others gain popularity use , extensively studied time . Currently , USA FDA approve EnSeal device vessel 7 mm diameter . This equal great vessel seal system widely use Ligasure ( 7 mm ) Harmonic Scalpel ( 5 mm ) . Porcine study do SurgRx well research group Cleveland Clinic - FL Carolinas Medical Center demonstrate safety device approve size range compare device . In study , find EnSeal significantly high burst pressure seal vessel seal system ( 678 mm Hg EnSeal vs 489 mm Hg Ligasure ) statistical difference , seal supra-physiologic pressure ( 891 mm Hg EnSeal vs 884 mm Hg Ligasure ) .1 , 2 These measurement obtain secure open end vessel device fill lumen fluid . Once seal end burst , machine record final pressure reading within lumen vessel . Other notable finding EnSeal include less adventitial damage vessel histopathologic evaluation minimal failure rate ( 1/39 vessel fail seal ) .1 , 2 A study complete Turkey use EnSeal rat liver parenchyma compare Ligasure conventional method liver resection . Sahin colleague find EnSeal least effective conventional technique le inflammation damage due thermal spread rat liver parenchyma compare Ligasure.16 In comparison two ultrasonic device human vessel , Ching find vein decrease burst pressure diameter vessel increase.17 These burst pressure much low report porcine artery . This finding make important determine seal burst pressure human vessel relationship experimental value porcine model clinically correlate . Previous study analyze histopathologic effect EnSeal device blood vessels.2 We also analysis human tissue . In practice , routinely use EnSeal device seal ileocolic vessel inferior mesenteric artery vein ( IMA , IMV ) . Data good evidence diameter ( external internal ) inferior mesenteric artery widely available . However , able find data provide little information . In study Yekeler et al , investigator use ultrasound technology determine internal diameter superior mesenteric artery ( SMA ) . In study , find healthy patient internal diameter average 5.8 mm . Among finding pattern significantly increase internal diameter patient active inflammation compare patient quiescent disease.18 We long suspect tissue experience acute chronic inflammation feed vessel large ; evidence support hypothesis . In small study examine use IMA coronary artery bypass graft , researcher harvest two IMAs measure one . This artery 4 mm diameter origin . The IMA small SMA vast majority patient . Therefore , finding Shatapathy consistent expectation.19 In practice , gravitate towards EnSeal . We find effective , reliable versatility evidence use grasper , dissector , scissors vessel soft-tissue sealer . The nano-particles within jaws device regulate current heat distribution serve protect adjacent tissue thermal injury . Such injury device document often present late serious complications.21 As part normal surgical practice , use EnSeal divide seal inferior mesenteric artery vein resection indicate . In experience device , low failure rate . We experience post-operative bleeding require transfusion re-operation . Even though believe majority IMAs encounter 7 mm size , surgeon feel comfortable use EnSeal seal vessel use stapler divide . We intend demonstrate bursting pressure large vessel ( IMA , IMV ) seal colectomy human patient sufficiently high . Using EnSeal device large vessel , believe , would reduce operating time , blood loss , hasten post-operative recovery less tissue manipulation . Methods In study include adult patient part vulnerable patient population . Inclusion criterion include patient undergoing resection part colon require divide IMA . We use resected surgical specimen project . We use EnSeal major vessel procedure . We use EnSeal 5 mm round head model . Due nature project , apply IRB approval prior begin research . We plan include 60 total patient study , 30 University Illinois 30 Lutheran General Hospital . Prior resection , use sterile caliper take in-vivo measurement IMA IMV . Immediately resection , remove seal proximal end IMA 3 cm distal surgical specimen . We similarly prepare IMV . We inspect vessel iatrogenic traumatic tear . If vessel suitable , gentle apply manual traction remove blood clot within lumen . We measure out diameter vessel use digital caliper . If small branch , tie suture . The unsealed end attach burst pressure tester suture test bursting pressure . The device measure pressure continuously infuse segment normal saline steady rate ( 50 ml/hr ) . A leak determined decrease intra-luminal pressure 100 mm Hg visible leak . A failure seal vessel determine burst pressure le 100 mm Hg . It note section would pressure-tested . All data collect enclosed data sheet create use protocol . We place vessel original surgical specimen submit routine pathological examination surgical specimen . Twenty five specimen site undergo testing , whereas 5 specimen send pathology without test . Our pathologist analyze submit specimen extent seal , disruption vessel smooth muscle , gas bubble , stain elastin analyze disruption vessel wall . In addition , seal measure obtain digital image . The specimen submit pathology 5 burst specimen well 5 un-burst specimen take pool 25 patient UIC . For human component , estimate standard deviation width confidence interval 100 mm Hg . With 95 % confidence level , expect require 16 measurement human specimens 16 patient although use 50 patient allow error obtain pressure . Our timeline completion project 6 month . We plan able complete human burst pressure test within 6 month . Budget The budget PAF number include study . The budget also include money concurrent study involve porcine vessel . We harvest blood vessel pig use research purpose euthanized . I include letter BRL stating study require approval use animal use purpose .</detailed_description>
