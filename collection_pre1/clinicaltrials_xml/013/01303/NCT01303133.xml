	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To assess compare amyloid deposition ( PiB PET ) non-demented/functionally stable adult DS across three age cohort ( 30-39 , 40-49 , &gt; 50 year age ) . Primary Hypothesis 1 : At initial assessment , significantly high prevalence amyloid-positive ( PiB+ ) subject succeeding age cohort . In addition , test follow secondary hypothesis : Secondary Aim 1 : To compare presence absence apolipoprotein-E4 allele retention PiB various brain area DS subject . Secondary Hypothesis 1 : At baseline , subject carry least one Apolipoprotein-E4 ( ApoE4 ) allele show high prevalence PiB+ .</detailed_description>
