	<brief_summary>Major epidemic meningococcal meningitis occur country African Sahel sub-Sahel every year . Most epidemic cause meningococci belonging serogroup A . Until recently serogroup A conjugate vaccine available prevent epidemic Africa none major pharmaceutical company want develop vaccine commercial reason . For reason public private partnership establish 2001 , Meningitis Vaccine Project ( MVP ) , support Bill Melinda Gates Foundation , develop affordable new serogroup A meningococcal conjugate vaccine Africa . The new vaccine , MenAfriVac™ , receive WHO pre-qualification 2010 mass campaign start Burkina Faso , Mali Niger 2010 . It expect full coverage mass vaccination campaign achieve end 2011 three country . A case-control study conduct Mali Niger epidemic season 2012 2013 ass efficacy MenAfriVac™ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Case-control Study Efficacy New Serogroup A Meningococcal Conjugate Vaccine ( MenAfriVac ) Mali Niger</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Massive epidemic meningococcal disease continue occur every year country African Sahel sub-Sahel - African meningitis belt . In 2009 50,000 report case Nigeria alone . Most epidemic cause meningococci belonging capsular polysaccharide serogroup A. African epidemic contain exist meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine , save many life , epidemic prevent use vaccine . Recently , new serogroup A meningococcal polysaccharide/protein conjugate vaccine ( MenAfriVac ) , may able prevent epidemic , prequalified World Health Organization . This vaccine develop Meningitis Vaccine Project ( MVP ) produce cost ( $ 0.40 per dose ) affordable country African meningitis belt . Mass vaccination campaign start Burkina Faso , Mali Niger end 2010 . Full coverage achieve 2011 progressive deployment country meningitis belt . The safety immunogenicity MenAfriVac establish phase 1 phase 2 trial conduct India Africa efficacy trial undertake . Prequalification grant assumption high level immunogenicity demonstrate African population would reflect similar degree efficacy . This likely , important efficacy vaccine establish definitively large sum spend deploy vaccine across African meningitis belt . Therefore , case control study determine efficacy MenAfriVac prevent serogroup A meningococcal meningitis Mali Niger propose . A case-control study conduct Mali Niger 2011 , 2012 2013 meningitis season . Cases meningitis detect exist routine surveillance system etiology establish use standard microbiology rapid diagnostic test . Cases proven serogroup A meningococcal meningitis ( culture , antigen PCR positive ) match two hospital two community control , turn , match case age place residence . A questionnaire administer case control ask previous meningococcal vaccination risk factor meningococcal disease might confound modify assessment impact vaccination MenAfriVac . A blood sample collect measurement serogroup A meningococcal bactericidal tetanus antibody , well total immunoglobulin level . Determination vaccination status facilitate fact vaccination card issue recipient time vaccination mass vaccination team . Vaccine efficacy determine compare odds exposure MenAfriVac case control .</detailed_description>
