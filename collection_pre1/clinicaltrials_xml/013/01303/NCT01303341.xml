	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define safe dose sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) combine riluzole treatment patient type solid tumor refractory standard therapy standard therapy exist . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine correlation clinical radiologic response signal mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) phosphoinositide 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /protein kinase B ( AKT ) pathways . II . To determine response therapy riluzole sorafenib correlate expression level B-cell lymphoma ( BCL ) -2 , myeloid cell leukemia ( MCL ) -1 , BCL2-like 11 ( apoptosis facilitator ) ( BIM ) . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics combination riluzole sorafenib determine drug-drug interaction exist . IV . To evaluate microvesicle ( inter-cellular communication approach may cargo protein , ribonucleic acid [ RNAs ] deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNAs ] host cell ) quantification difference pre-treatment post-treatment peripheral blood sample patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study sorafenib tosylate . Patients receive riluzole orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) sorafenib tosylate PO daily ( QD ) BID day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow approximately 2-3 year .</detailed_description>
