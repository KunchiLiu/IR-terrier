	<brief_title>A Novel Diet-Phenotype Interaction Affecting Body Weight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , diet widely vary composition use treatment obesity . While none diet produce consistent , long-term weight loss , individual virtually type diet remarkably well . One explanation variation among individual difference motivation behavior . However , underlie biological difference may also play important role . Previous work identify insulin secretion ( quantified serum insulin concentration 30 minute follow standard 75-gram oral glucose load ) important biological determinant . This randomized-controlled , multi-center trial aim test hypothesis insulin secretion predict type diet work best individual . A total 160 obese young adult ( 18 40 year ) assign one two diet : low-fat ( 60 % carbohydrate , 20 % fat , 20 % protein ) low-glycemic load ( 45 % carbohydrate , 35 % fat , 20 % protein ) . Participants enrol two site ( Children 's Hospital Boston University North Carolina-Chapel Hill ) assign diet group accord baseline insulin secretion status . The protocol include intensive 6-month intervention period 12-month follow-up period . Registered dietitians provide nutrition education behavioral counsel group workshop schedule telephone call . In effort avoid confounding , close attention pay control treatment intensity , physical activity prescription , behavioral method group . The primary endpoint percent body fat DXA scan . Secondary endpoint include cardiovascular diabetes risk factor . Repeated , 24-hour dietary physical activity recall interview provide process data . Metabolomic profile molecular analysis identify metabolite conduct characterize phenotype explore potential physiological mechanism . A successful outcome work inform practice `` personalize '' nutritional therapy , enhance ability select efficacious weight loss diet individual base underlying biological difference .</detailed_description>
