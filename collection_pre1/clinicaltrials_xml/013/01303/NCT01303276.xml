	<brief_summary>Ranibizumab ( Lucentis , Genentech ) off-label drug use clinical treatment central retinal vein occlusion , one common retinal vascular disorder . Despite clinical effectiveness , concern remain regard systemic effect drug previous study note retinal arteriolar vasoconstriction follow ranibizumab injection . We aim provide physiological basis observation assess retinal blood flow ranibizumab injection . Specifically , assess blood flow parameter ( i.e . retinal vessel diameter , velocity &amp; flow ) immediately first injection post-injection follow-up continued treatment period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Retinal Blood Flow Response Intravitreal Injection Ranibizumab Central Retinal Vein Occlusion ( CRVO )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ranibizumab antibody fragment design inhibit activity Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) , responsible neovascularization retinal edema responsible interference normal vision central retinal vein occlusion . However , VEGF role vasculature vasodilator alters expression tight junction proteins upregulates release vasodilator nitric oxide . Consequently , intravitreal ranibizumab injection could result systemic inhibition VEGF , lead long-term retinal arteriolar vasoconstriction potentially adverse cerebrovascular myocardial accident . Therefore , evaluate retinal blood flow would provide physiological foundation concern provide physicians valuable information regard risk continue ranibizumab therapy . Given role VEGF vasodilator vasculature work alter expression tight junction protein production vasoactive substance especially nitric oxide , inhibit molecule ranibizumab could result vasoconstriction vessel . We hypothesize vasoconstriction decrease retinal blood flow observe intravitreal injection ranibizumab treatment central retinal vein occlusion .</detailed_description>
