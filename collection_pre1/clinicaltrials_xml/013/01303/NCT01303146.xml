	<brief_summary>There currently effective treatment late infantile MLD clinical symptom evident . METAZYM recombinant human arylsulfatase A develop intravenous ERT treatment late infantile MLD . The overall objective study evaluate efficacy safety intravenous rhASA treatment patient late infantile MLD previously receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HCT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy METAZYM Treatment Metachromatic Leukodystrophy Treated With Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metachromatic Leukodystrophy ( MLD ) rare autosomal recessive disorder cause deficiency Arylsulfatase A enzyme ( ARSA ) , result accumulation galactosyl sulfatide ( cerebroside sulfate ) , major constituent myelin sheath . Accumulation galactosyl sulfatides lead progressive degeneration white matter central peripheral nervous system ( CNS , PNS ) neuronal degeneration . The late infantile form MLD , usually diagnose second year life , frequent severe form disease . The prognosis severe , lead vegetative stage death within year diagnosis . There treatment patient affect early onset form disease . In patient late-onset MLD ( juvenile adult form ) , allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation stabilize cerebral demyelination . This treatment however inefficient patient late infantile MLD symptomatic stage . The overall objective evaluate efficacy safety rhASA treatment patient late infantile MLD receive HCT presymptomatic stage disease . Patient receive rhARSA ( 100 U/kg ) intravenously every week period 18 month .</detailed_description>
