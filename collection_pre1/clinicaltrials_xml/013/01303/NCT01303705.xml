	<brief_title>Anti-OX40 , Cyclophosphamide ( CTX ) Radiation Patients With Progressive Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Phase Ib trial design employ patient metastatic PC fail prior androgen ablation docetaxel . CTX administer also Day 1 . All patient receive RT ( 800 cGy single fraction ) 3 bone metastatic site Day 4 AM . Anti-OX40 0.4 mg/kg IV give day 4 , 6 8 . The timing CTX , RT anti-OX40 base pre-clinical model observation synergy CTX RT reduce give one week anti-OX40 maximize give within 3 day start anti-OX40 . The propose radiation dose commonly use palliate bone pain PC generally induce significant cytopenia . The CTX dose escalate successive cohort 3 - 6 patient assure patient safety . The dose level CTX 300 , 600 900 mg/m2 intravenously initial stage study . The range CTX dose commonly use general oncology practice expect induce prolonged myelosuppression , although transient cytopenia likely . Concurrent CTX RT well-tolerated much high dose-intensities investigator propose ( 52-54 ) , thus investigator expect significant adverse event combination anti-OX40 . As safety consideration , investigator give CTX RT day high proportion men prostate cancer bone metastases pelvis . RT pelvis could cause radiation cystitis would exacerbate metabolite CTX ( e.g. , acrolein ) accumulate bladder 24-36 hour administration . After dose-escalation portion trial 20 additional patient enroll study maximum tolerate CTX dose clinical response see , maximum total 37 patient use Simon two-stage design ( see Section 10 detail ) . The main clinical objective trial characterize toxicity estimate response rate combination anti-OX40 , CTX RT . Both radiographic PSA response follow . RECIST use radiographic assessment significant PSA response define 50 % great decrease baseline measure 3 6 week start treatment base PCWG2 guideline ( 55 ) . Patients enroll consecutively cohort assume dose-limiting toxicity . Three patient treat per cohort dose-limiting toxicity , enrollment next cohort begin . If dose-limiting toxicity encounter first three patient cohort , additional three patient enrol cohort . * This dosing strategy allow three-fold escalation CTX . The main hypothesis study CTX RT induce tumor breakdown provide source antigen self-vaccination anti-OX40 amplify CD8-mediated effector response across broad spectrum prostate cancer antigens result regression prostate cancer . The investigator predict anti-OX40 increase circulate intratumoral Treg , help augment immune response . *For dose escalation portion study , first 2 patient cohort treat consecutive week . If Dose Limiting Toxicities , third patient begin treatment 28 day second patient complete anti-OX40 . If third patient DLT , next cohort open 28 day third patient complete anti-OX40 . If DLT occur patient 3 cohort , 3 patient enroll cohort frequency one patient every 28 day previous patient complete anti-OX40 assume DLT .</detailed_description>
