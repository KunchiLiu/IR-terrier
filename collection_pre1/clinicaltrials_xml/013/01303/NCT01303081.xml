	<brief_title>Pilot Randomized Control Trial Financial Incentives Smoking Cessation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design explore potential efficacy use internet-based incentive program promote smoke cessation . We also hope document recruit participant web site , well investigate form incentives show promise . We seek achieve three specific objective : ( 1 ) ass ability recruit participant several different type intervention-based smoking program ; ( 2 ) document feasibility use internet accrue disburse incentive payment ; ( 3 ) obtain preliminary assessment incentive structure show promise future study . Potential participant direct Way Health research portal assess eligibility . The web application automatically verify eligibility base result survey . If person deem eligible , invited consent participate non-pharmacologic smoking cessation study last 3 month . Participants consent randomize automatically one 5 intervention arm ( include no-incentive arm ) web application . Once participant consent submits necessary financial information , gain access participant interface . At point , receive detailed description assign incentive structure ( usual care provision ) , indicate acceptance assign structure , arm 3 , 4 , 5 , make require deposit . Also , prompt take initial survey baseline smoking habit . The participant able log interface anytime see graph self-reported smoking habit along graph approximately much money save compare baseline smoking level . Participants indicate prefer method contact : email , text-messaging , . Every week participant receive email text-message reminder log complete weekly smoking report . Participants also log time report smoke habit give day day improve accuracy . After three month subject e-mailed prompt log web application take final smoking habit survey . Participants report remain smoke free last month study submit saliva ( urine , participant use form nicotine replacement therapy ) sample test cotinine ( anabasine ) verify quit . Once verified , participant send whatever financial incentive earn deposit return . The design study differs traditional RCT two important way . First , goal RCT focus mechanisms behavior change , include primary per-protocol analysis design determine incentive structure ' efficacy analyze participant accept assigned incentive structure time randomization . In analysis , randomization arm enter analytic model instrumental variable mitigate potential selection bias . As traditional RCT , also analyze incentive structure ' effectiveness use intention-to-treat analysis include randomized participant , regardless whether accept randomly assign arm . The second difference acceptance rate different structure may differ ( test Aim II ) , adapt probability randomize arm weekly basis enrollment period achieve target number participant per-protocol analysis .</detailed_description>
