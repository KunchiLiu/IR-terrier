	<brief_summary>Transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block increasingly perform abdominal surgery provide post operative analgesia . Dexamethasone demonstrate ability prolong effective duration analgesia several different peripheral nerve block . The study examine , blind , prospective randomize fashion , whether addition dexamethasone TAP block similarly prolongs blockade pain relief . The study compare local anesthetic without addition dexamethasone TAP block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Addition Dexamethasone Transversus Abdominis Plane ( TAP ) Peripheral Nerve Block</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study do two phase . In first phase , patient randomize receive either 20 cc 0.125 % bupivicaine without 2 mg dexamethasone side abdomen ( 40 cc 4 mg total ) patient receive dexamethasone compare patient receive . In second phase , ass whether patient serve control add dexamethasone one side block ( one side abdomen ) compare pain relief/efficacy contra-lateral plain local anesthetic effect . The study ass pain relief , opioid consumption , level blockade , operator 's prospective assessment likely efficacy , base ultrasound visualization local anesthetic injection compare actual efficacy .</detailed_description>

Subjects able give fully inform consent participate study demonstrate good understanding risk benefit propose component TAP block . Demonstrated hypersensitivity allergy local anesthetic dexamethasone . Any subject whose anatomy , surgical procedure , opinion investigator , might preclude potential successful performance TAP block .
