	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety ability endoscopic bipolar radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) probe ( ENDOHPB ) produce improvement management cancer bile duct pancreatic duct . By use radiofrequency ( RF ) energy heat tissue duct prior insertion stent , surround tissue becomes coagulate may delay tumour growth time stent lumen become block . Thereby , allow increase period need intervention stent deployment . The study look see ENDOHPB able keep stent open long perhaps decrease number invasive procedure occlude ( block ) stent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Only small proportion patient biliary obstruction cause cholangiocarcinoma pancreatic cancer suitable surgical resection . As cancer grows , block drainage bile duct carry digestive juice gall bladder pancreas small intestine . Blocked drainage cause abdominal pain , bloating , nausea . ERCP ( endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ) often prescribe . ERCP stent placement standard medical procedure people bile duct pancreatic cancer . The purpose study assess safety ability endoscopic bipolar radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) probe ( ENDOHPB ) produce improvement management cancer bile duct pancreatic duct . By use radiofrequency ( RF ) energy heat tissue duct prior insertion stent , surround tissue becomes coagulate may delay tumour growth time stent lumen become block . Thereby , allow increase period need intervention stent deployment . The study look see ENDOHPB able keep stent open long perhaps decrease number invasive procedure occlude ( block ) stent . The objective : â€¢ To assess assess safety effectiveness endoscopic bipolar radiofrequency catheter ( EndoHPB ) management unresectable cholangiocarcinoma pancreatic cancer</detailed_description>
