The approximate duration subject participation 18 month approximate total duration study 42 month . The duration subject enrollment approximately 24 month . 2 . Discussion Trial Design The study design directly compare effectiveness combination therapy MTX + ETN versus 3 .

	<detailed_description>Early arthritis frequently undifferentiated . It well recognise substantial proportion patient undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis go develop persistent synovitis , strong predictor persistence disease duration &gt; 12 week ( 1-4 ) . Studies show patient early oligoarthritis fail respond within 2 week corticosteroid injection high likelihood persistent disease ( 2 ) . It therefore clear patient early inflammatory arthritis need definitive treatment , optimal therapeutic strategy yet determine . Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) naturally occur cytokine involve normal inflammatory immune response . It play important role inflammatory process rheumatoid arthritis , result joint pathology . Elevated level TNF find synovial fluid patient RA . Two distinct receptor TNF exist naturally monomeric molecule cell surface soluble form . Biological activity TNF dependent upon bind either cell surface TNF receptor ( TNFR ) . Etanercept ( ETN ) dimeric fusion protein consist p75 TNFR link Fc portion human IgG1 , capable bind two TNF molecule . Etanercept inhibit bind TNF-alpha TNF-beta cell surface TNFRs , render TNF biologically inactive . Agents block TNF effective type arthritis ( exclusion connective tissue disease ) . It generally agree window opportunity active early inflammatory arthritis definitive treatment may give disproportionate improvement compare treatment later time , may well able induce remission subgroup patient . Studies early rheumatoid arthritis ( &lt; 12 month ) show remission-induction TNF-antagonist infliximab provide significant reduction MRI-evidence synovitis erosion 12 month evidence sustain functional quality life benefit 2 year , despite withdrawal infliximab 12 month ( 5 ) . Results TEMPO study show treatment establish rheumatoid arthritis ETN+MTX achieve remission 40 % patient ( 6 ) . TNF antagonists also therapeutic benefit rapid sustain suppression inflammation . Treatment patient early undifferentiated arthritis ETN+MTX hypothesise prevent progression persistent disable disease significant number patient . Induction remission time disease course may result sustained remission , reduce need treatment , cost effective therapeutic strategy .</detailed_description>
