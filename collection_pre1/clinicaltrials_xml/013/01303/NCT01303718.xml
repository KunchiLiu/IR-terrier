Acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) , variant angina pectoris , unstable angina acute coronary syndrome previous one month . 3 . History stroke TIA within previous 3 month significant neurological damage would impair ability respond detect improvement vagal nerve stimulation . 4 . Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ( CABG ) , valve replacement repair , aortic surgery PCI ) prior 3 month planned/anticipated within 6 month . 5 . Heart failure due acute myocarditis , restrictive cardiomyopathy , constrictive pericarditis hemodynamically significant aortic valve insufficiency , aortic stenosis , mitral valve stenosis . 6 . Severe renal failure ( creatinine level &gt; 3 mg/dL ( 265 micromole/liter ) . 7 . Severe hepatic failure ( transaminase level four time ULN , total bilirubin level &gt; 1.8 mmol/dL ) . 8 . Uncontrolled Diabetes Mellitus , opinion investigator , would compromise safety implant procedure and/or ability respond detect improvement vagal nerve stimulation . 9 . Previous right neck surgery , include cerebrovascular disease ( CVD ) , malignancy , previous irradiation therapy neck , opinion implant surgeon , would preclude safe implantation vagal nerve cuff . Subjects 70 % right carotid artery stenosis assess carotid ultrasound exclude . 10 . Current hypotension ( systolic blood pressure 80 mmHg ) . 11 .
