	<brief_title>Low Dose Naltrexone Glioma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial . Potential participant identify via clinical protocol chart review patient schedule attend predetermine follow-up consultation The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center ( PRT-BTC ) Duke University Medical Center evaluation treatment newly diagnose high grade glioma . We identify high grade glioma patient receive standard chemoradiation ( radiotherapy daily temozolomide dose 75 mg/m2 ) . After obtain write informed consent , participant schedule baseline study assessment start radiotherapy . Patients randomize receive either placebo low dose naltrexone ( LDN ) dose 4.5 mg orally take every evening go bed . Patients assess follow time point : 1 . Baseline ( chemoradiation ) , 2 . After chemoradiation ( approximately 8 week initial assessment ) , 3 . Two month standard chemoradiation ( approximately 16 week initial assessment ) , 4 . Four month standard chemoradiation ( approximately 24 week initial assessment ) . Treatment LDN placebo begin first day chemoradiation continue total 16 week initial assessment . Last assessment 24 week occur 8 week discontinuation LDN placebo . All visit link patient ' clinical management visit . All test perform PRT-BTC Duke University Medical Center . The following procedure obtain assessment visit : 1 . Complete six-minute walk test . The exercise test design determine far subject walk six minute . This test take place PRT-BTC Duke University Medical Center appropriate medical supervision . 2 . Blood test perform part clinic visit . Approximately 10 milliliter 2 teaspoon blood drawn visit . This additional blood work , rather standardize blood work subject need evaluation associate radiation chemotherapy treatment . We ask subject complete follow tests/questionnaires : 1 . Neurocognitive testing : testing perform use computer program call CNS Vital Signs® . This program consist verbal visual memory test , attention test , reason test , speed processing test . The subject use laptop computer complete test . No previous exposure computer computer test need complete test . 2 . Computerized Questionnaires : Four questionnaire present use computerized program . These include Medical Outcomes Survey ( MOS ) , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) , Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale ( ZSDS ) . MOS assess general health , well-being , quality life . ESS ask level sleepiness PSQI ask sleep quality . Finally , ZSDS evaluate feeling depression sadness . 3 . Beck depression inventory ( BDI ) : This questionnaire ask question subject 's level sadness , change subject 's mood , sleep eat pattern , subject 's level interest activity , thought feeling subject subject 's level concentration . This pen paper questionnaire . 4 . Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Brain ( FACT-BR ) scale : This questionnaire ask question physical , function , emotional , social well-being . This pen paper questionnaire . 5 . Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Fatigue ( FACIT-F ) scale : This questionnaire ask question fatigue . This pen paper questionnaire . 6 . Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Cognition ( FACT-Cog ) scale : This questionnaire ask question think ability memory , attention , reason activity . This pen paper questionnaire .</detailed_description>
