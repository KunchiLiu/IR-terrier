	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety pharmacokinetic profile RRx-001 injection subject advance solid tumor lymphomas currently accept curative therapy . This study also conduct exploratory evaluation objective tumor response use CT MRI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetic Study RRx-001 Cancer Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The DINAMIC ( DINitroazetidines As Medications In Cancer ) trial represent provascular approach temporarily change tumor blood flow oxygenation . Blood supply tumor poor , cause part tumor low oxygen content promote aggressiveness metastasis . The DINAMIC trial use specific image technique ( include ultrasound ) , biopsy , breath analysis provide early assessment therapeutic activity .</detailed_description>
