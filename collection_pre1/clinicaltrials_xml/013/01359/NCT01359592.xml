	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone , work different way stop cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill cancer cell . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Radiolabeled monoclonal antibody , yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan , find cancer cell carry cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . Comparing result diagnostic procedure , PET scan CT scan , do , , chemotherapy may help doctor predict patient 's response treatment help plan best treatment . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well PET-directed chemotherapy work treat patient limited-stage diffuse large B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S1001 PET-Directed Therapy Treating Patients With Limited-Stage Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To assess 5-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate patient newly diagnose limited-stage diffuse , large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) use positron emission tomography ( PET ) /CT scan direct therapy 3 course rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone ( R-CHOP ) . Secondary - To evaluate PFS within PET-positive ( + ) PET-negative ( - ) subgroup patient newly diagnose limited-stage DLBCL . - To evaluate toxicity protocol treatment patient population . - To evaluate response probability patient population . - To evaluate overall survival overall population , within PET+ PET- subgroup . - To estimate rate upstaging baseline PET/CT baseline among patient newly diagnose limited-stage DLBCL CT image describe outcome patient upstaged PET/CT baseline advance DLBCL . - To describe outcome subgroup patient upstaged PET/CT . - To evaluate association germinal center B-cell subtype ( GCB ) vs stromal-1 vs stromal-2 gene expression signatures PFS overall survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord whether patient upstage advanced stage DLBCL , base local review baseline PET/CT ( yes v ) . Chemotherapy : Patients receive R-CHOP comprise rituximab IV , cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute , vincristine sulfate IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1 , prednisone orally day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3* course . NOTE : *Patients find advanced stage DLBCL base local review baseline PET scan receive 6 course R-CHOP . FDG/PET - Radiotherapy : Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) /CT scan baseline , day 15-18 course 3 , 12 week completion course 3 . Patients complete response ( PET scan negative ) receive one additional course R-CHOP . Patients partial response ( PET scan positive ) undergo involved-field radiotherapy ( IFRT ) 5 day week approximately 4-5 week . Monoclonal antibody : Beginning 3-6 week completion IFRT , patient receive yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV 10 minute rituximab IV day 1 day 7 , 8 , 9 . Patients may undergo blood sample collection baseline correlative study . Bone marrow tissue sample may also collect correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month 2 year yearly 5 year .</detailed_description>
