	<brief_summary>Hypothesis No study consider comparison preemptive vs. post-surgery Pregabalin ( PGL ) administration . The investigator believe administration PGL preemptively would diminish pain sensation therefore need opioids administration orthopedic-oncologic patient effectively administer start postoperatively .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pre- Versus Post-incisional Pregabalin Postoperative Pain Attenuation Analgesics Spare Orthopedic Oncologic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Proper pain relief major concern patient worldwide . Pain concern surgical team well , correlation clinical outcome patient ' satisfaction rate . Studies show negative clinical outcome regard pain control include decrease vital capacity alveolar ventilation , pneumonia , tachycardia , hypertension , myocardial ischemia , transition chronic pain , poor wound heal , psychological sequela . Pain find one three common medical cause delayed/aborted discharge ambulatory surgery , two drowsiness postoperative nausea/vomiting . Despite progress make regard postoperative pain control , development new standard pain control , many patient continue experience intense pain surgery . Recent advance understand particularity central sensitization indicate play important role post surgical post traumatic pain therefore avoid . We distinguish postoperative pain , mostly nociceptive , perceive pain follow surgical insult , exacerbation acute nociceptive pain lead neural sensitization , sensation normally painful , perceived painful , hyperalgesia allodynia . Thus , acute pain may transform subacute chronic pain , condition harder control persistent ( chronic ) become . Better pain control , possibly use drug affect acute chronic pain , seem therefore current optimal choice . Multimodal analgesia Advances knowledge neuropharmacological molecular mechanism pain lead development `` multimodal analgesia '' practice . The concept multimodal analgesia well establish clinical practice . For example , non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication combine intravenous patient-controlled morphine administration , may decrease nausea sedation patient compare use patient-controlled morphine analgesia alone . Multimodal analgesia also produce opioid sparing effect . Our group show repeatedly , multimodal analgesia spare postoperative morphine consumption increase level patient ' satisfaction . However , may improve postoperative outcome term faster recovery , reduce hospital stay , decrease length convalescence . Analgesic adjuvant Adjuvants compound , may undesirable side effect low potency combination opioids allow reduction narcotic dose postoperative pain control . They need due side effect opioid analgesic , hinder recovery , especially increasingly utilizing ambulatory surgical procedure . One new group product non-analgesic substance , therefore name `` adjuvant '' , anticonvulsant ( e.g. , pregabalin ) . Pregabalin ( PGL ) Interest focus analgesic , sedative , anxiolytic , opioid-sparing effect pregabalin ( PGL ) ( S+ 3-isobutyl GABA ) , structural analog GABA ( Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ) derivative gabapentin various pain setting , include postoperative pain . Of similar mechanism action , think possess superior pharmacokinetic profile gabapentin . Pregabalin variable role neuropathic pain condition , post-herpetic neuralgia , painful diabetic neuropathy , central neuropathic pain , fibromyalgia . Some study demonstrate significant analgesic effect acute , postoperative pain ; others propose PGL effective sedative opioid-sparing effect , useful characteristic control acute pain . Opioid spar effect improve pain score see abdominal pelvic surgery . Its many potential action reduce opioid requirement , prevention reduction opioid tolerance , improvement quality opioid analgesia , decrease respiratory depression , relief anxiety , gastric sparing , make attractive drug consider control pain post operative period . Population characteristics The orthopedic oncological patient specific group individual whose demand antinociception start rather surgery bone tumor-generated pain usually signal first existence pathology . Subsequently , patient would require postoperatively analgesics general surgery longer period time . We demonstrate previously acute pain superimpose already arouse CNS ( central nervous system ) , i.e. , presence central sensitization , would create situation complete antinociception hard obtain , patient , therefore efficacy antinociceptive protocol best test , comprise possible transformation acute chronic pain . preemptive drug point beneficial tool reduce perioperative pain . Various technique employ purpose ; different drug use well . The beneficial effect preemptive PGL document patient undergone lumbar discectomy , immediately 1 3 month surgery .</detailed_description>
