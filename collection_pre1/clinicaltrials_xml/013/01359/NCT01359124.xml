	<brief_title>Reaching Exercise Goals : Comparison Exercise Means Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis common joint disorder United States , affect approximately 26.9 million adult great 25 year age . This disorder debilitating : 40 % adult doctor diagnose arthritis report joint symptom cause modify activity . Risk disability ( define need help walk climb stair ) associate osteoarthritis consider equivalent cardiovascular disease great medical condition elderly patient [ 13 ] . Persons disability associate osteoarthritis substantially bad health-related quality life , large part due inability exercise . Exercise show help maintain function knee osteoarthritis [ 5 ] . Aerobic walk quadriceps strengthen exercise ( [ 18 ] ; [ 7 ] ) resistance train [ 15 ] demonstrate exercise potentially improve pain function individual knee osteoarthritis . Likewise , Cochrane review aquatic exercise provide gold level evidence aquatic exercise probably reduce pain increase function 3 month ; , state clearly research need understand type aquatic exercise , often , long might beneficial [ 2 ] . The American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) recommendation healthy adult recommend moderate-intensity aerobic exercise ( endurance ) physical activity minimum 30 minute , 5 day per week vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity minimum 20 minute , 3 day per week healthy adult age 18 65 promote maintain health [ 9 ] . The best method reach current ACSM goal patient knee osteoarthritis know , impact-related exercise certainly demand healthy joint many patient knee osteoarthritis tolerate form exercise . In counsel patient knee osteoarthritis , question remain : best exercise reach ACSM goal exercise . This study compare water-based land-based treadmill exercise upright cycle meeting ACSM exercise goal moderate exercise . Interested subject undergo knee radiograph confirm presence degree knee osteoarthritis . Eligible participant randomize one three exercise cohort . During session , participant complete 10 45 minute exercise , goal achieve 30 minute moderate aerobic exercise . All subject participate routine activity 8 week study period outside study protocol ( strength training , cardio training , etc. ) . Health status measurement questionnaire ( WOMAC , KOOS , SF12 ) complete time randomization conclusion week exercise total 9 time .</detailed_description>
