	<brief_summary>The prognosis patient locally advance unresectable pancreatic cancer poor , median survival less 1 year . FOLFIRINOX therapy , induces tumor downstaging sufficient allow surgical resection , could improve overall survival patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer . Based FOLFIRINOX regimen advance pancreatic cancer , phase II study regimen patient locally advance unresectable borderline pancreatic cancer plan determine rate conversion operability .</brief_summary>
