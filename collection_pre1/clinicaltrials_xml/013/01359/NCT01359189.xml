	<brief_summary>This feasibility , exploratory , proof-of-concept study evaluate rectal probe scintigraphy device ( ProxiScanTM ) detect PSMA specific radiopharmaceutical agent ( ProstaScint® ) patient suspect primary prostate cancer . ProxiScanTM small cadmium zinc telluride ( CST ) -based compact gamma camera size trans-rectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) develop Hybridyne Imaging Technologies , Inc.To explore adjunctive benefit/feasibility PSMA distribution normal prostate versus prostate cancer gland utilize TRUS CT/SPECT hybrid imaging , biopsy negative patient consider normal control . Prostate cancer sextant biopsy histology result correlate ProxiScanTM , TRUS , pelvis planar SPECT/CT . Our hypothesis safe feasible utilize rectal probe scintigraphy ( ProxiScanTM ) detect PSMA specific ProstaScint® uptake primary prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This feasibility , exploratory , proof-of-concept study evaluate rectal probe scintigraphy device ( ProxiScanTM ) detect PSMA specific radiopharmaceutical agent ( ProstaScint® ) patient suspect primary prostate cancer . ProxiScanTM small cadmium zinc telluride ( CST ) -based compact gamma camera size trans-rectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) develop Hybridyne Imaging Technologies , Inc. Due inherent small size , camera capable potentially image prostate cancer specific radiopharmaceutical uptake distribute within prostate gland locate closely adjacent camera head.In study investigator enroll patient clinical suspicion high likelihood prostate cancer . A scintigraphic rectal probe ( ProxiScanTM ) use detect ProstaScint® uptake prostate gland , comparison TRUS pelvis planar SPECT/CT . The incidence biopsy positive prostate cancer patient suspect disease clinically range 25 % 40 % ; therefore 12 patient enrol study . To explore adjunctive benefit/feasibility PSMA distribution normal prostate versus prostate cancer gland utilize TRUS CT/SPECT hybrid imaging , biopsy negative patient consider normal control . Prostate cancer sextant biopsy histology result correlate ProxiScanTM , TRUS , pelvis planar SPECT/CT . Our hypothesis safe feasible utilize rectal probe scintigraphy ( ProxiScanTM ) detect PSMA specific ProstaScint® uptake primary prostate cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Elevated PSA ≥ 4ng/mL and/or abnormal digital rectal exam suspicious prostate cancer . Planned sextant prostate biopsy . Sufficient time period complete image protocol 5 7 day safety followup assessment without prostate biopsy therapeutic intervention . Patient judge Investigator initiative mean provide write consent compliant protocol able commits make require study visit . Ambulatory ECOG performance status 0 1 ; Karnofsky performance scale ≥ 70 . ( see appendix ) Patient 30 75 year age . Patient physician plan definitive concomitant chemotherapy , therapeutic radiation treatment , biologic treatment and/or local ablative treatment cancer within interval study participation . Prior therapeutic pelvic irradiation . Recent prostate biopsy , within 1 month study enrollment . Patient contraindication TRUSguided prostate biopsy ( continuous need anticoagulation , rectum , etc . ) Clinical evidence prostatitis , benign prostate gland abnormality , would explain elevated PSA and/or ( digital rectal exam ) DRE finding . Active malignancy therapy malignancy within 6 month , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patient receive radiopharmaceutical within 5 physical halflives time study image . Known history humanantimurineantibodies ( HAMA ) know allergic reaction previously receive murine base product .</criteria>
