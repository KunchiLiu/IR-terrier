	<brief_title>e- Ab Sensor-based Real-time Detection Mutant EGFR Clinical Specimens From Patients Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) play important role development non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . High EGFR mutation rate find certain population , include female , non-smoker , East Asian , adenocarcinoma . Previous study show patient NSCLC mutant EGFR would better survival , related EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment.1-2 IPASS study show longer progression-free survival ( PFS ) gefitinib treatment carboplatin-paclitaxel , patient lung adenocarcinoma clinical characteristic suggest high EGFR mutation rate.3 However , EGFR mutation associate sensitivity tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment , especially deletion exon 19 L858R mutation exon 21.4-5 Two recent phase III randomize clinical trial evaluate gefitinib treatment chemotherapy patient advance NSCLC sensitive EGFR mutaions.6-7 In patient advanced NSCLC sensitive EGFR mutation , PFS gefitinib 9.2~10.8 month , long platinum-based chemotherapy . Therefore , develop individualized treatment patient NSCLC , important EGFR mutation status time diagnosis . Current techniques available detection EGFR mutation need direct sequence EGFR tyrosine kinase domain , costly time-consuming . 8 For detection specific EGFR mutation , mutation-specific monoclonal antibody develop detect E746-A750 deletion exon 19 L858R exon 21 . In pilot study , immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) assay use mutation-specific antibody show sensitivity 92 % specificity 99 % .9 Recent two study examine performance mutation-specific antibody disclose inconsistent sensitivity specificity . In study Akhiko Kawahara et al , IHC assay NSCLC tumor specimens anti-delE746-A750 antibody show sensitivity 79 % , 83 % IHC assay anti-L858R antibody.10 In study Atsuko Kitamura et al , IHC assay anti-delE746-A750 antibody show high specificity low sensitivity ( 99 % 40 % , respectively ) . IHC assay anti-L858R antibody also show high specificity low sensitivity ( 97 % 36 % , respectively ) . The overall sensitivity specificity two mutation-specific antibody 96 % 47 % .11 The discrepancy two study currently unknown . Another study conduct Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center show performance two mutation-specific antibody would affect cutoff IHC score.12 For anti-L858R antibody , sensitivity 76 % -95 % positive predict value 99 % -100 % . For anti-delE746-A750 antibody , sensitivity 85 % -67 % positive predict value 99 % -100 % . It unknown performance mutation-specific monoclonal antibody could enhance use automate quantitative system ( AQUA ) . However , techinique need equipment cost , could n't offer immediate information EGFR mutation clinician . Electrosensing antibody probe system ( e- Ab sensor ) , develop rapid sensitive detection hapten , protein , viral antigen medical sample , use analyze interaction kinetics mutation specific anti-EGFR antigen ( EGFR E746-A750 deletion L858R mutation ) present specimens patient lung cancer . The system incorporate use engineer semiconducive antibody virus vertical lateral chip ( eAbchip ) lateral flow ( eAbsignal ) format . In electrosensing antibody probing , semiconductive antibody bound suitable electrosensing probe , specifically selectively bind targeted molecule ( i.e . specific mutant EGFR ) test specimen . From assessment electric signature semiconductive mutation-specific anti-EGFR antibody , eABprobe could offer sensitive detection precise quantification specific mutant EGFR . To develop real-time diagnostic technique e- Ab sensor specific EGFR mutation detection clinical specimen NSCLC patient , conduct prospective clinical study . In comparison result direct sequence EGFR , evaluate performance e- Ab sensor , include reproducibility , sensitivity , specificity , cross-reaction ( detection EGFR mutation L858R DelL746-A750 ) . The potential factor may interfere result would investigate . With technique , obtain EGFR mutation information NSCLC patient cost-saving time-saving way offer individualized treatment patient .</detailed_description>
