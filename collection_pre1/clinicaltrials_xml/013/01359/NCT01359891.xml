	<brief_summary>The protein ST2 member interleukin-1 receptor family . Blood concentration soluble isoform ST2 ( sST2 ) increase inflammatory heart disease consider prognostic marker . The Presageâ„¢ST2 assay recently show meet need quality specification laboratory medicine . Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ( suPAR ) level reflect inflammation elevate suPAR level find several infectious disease cancer . Both sST2 suPAR recently introduce sensitive biomarkers patient septicemia . Both may promise even superior alternative currently establish sepsis marker lead improvement outcome patient septicemia . However , clinical study clarifies kinetics value time/possible correlation causative pathogen/progress/deterioration septic patient urgently need biomarkers establish clinical routine . Primary study objective To clinically evaluate sST2 suPAR patient bacteremia /septicemia . To correlate result causative bacterial organism , response failure antiinfective treatment , severity clinical status well outcome . To study kinetics test result correlate sST2/suPAR result well establish infection marker ( e.g . C-reactive protein , procalcitonin , blood count ) . Natural endpoint study patient 's death complete recovery . This explorative study . To meet objective novel biomarkers clinically evaluate cohort 500 in-patients septicemia University Hospital Graz . Starting day patient 's blood culture turn positive investigator collect sample every 12h within first two day every 24h.Measurement sST2 suPAR value do retrospectively . To analyze clinical sensitivity/specificity novel biomarkers sST2 suPAR prognostic factor development bacteremia/septicemia , second cohort consist 250 in-patients investigated longitudinal matter . Patients without previous positive blood culture test current episode disease blood culture order physician include sST2 suPAR level determine sample take simultaneously first blood culture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The two common causative pathogen septicemia ( Escherichia coli Staphylococcus aureus ) well case fungemia ( Candida spp. , Aspergillus spp. , others ) include first study group . At hospital estimate yearly case bacteremia/fungemia ( 230 Escherichia coli , 150 Staphylococcus aureus , 50 fungi ) include first study group . Furthermore , two biomarkers determine 70 case septicemia bacterial pathogen sepsis due viral pathogen viremia evaluation clinical impact two biomarkers .</detailed_description>
