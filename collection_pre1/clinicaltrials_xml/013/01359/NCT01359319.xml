	<brief_summary>Hereditary Inclusion Body Myopathy ( HIBM ) severe progressive metabolic myopathy cause defect biosynthetic pathway sialic acid ( SA ) , critical component many muscle protein , result deficiency SA muscle HIBM patient . The effective replacement miss SA substrate theoretically simple , , animal model , replacement SA show significant restoration sialylation biochemistry excellent reduction muscle disease . These data show replacement achieve significant clinical benefit muscle pathology , function , survival .</brief_summary>
