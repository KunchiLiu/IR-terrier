	<brief_summary>Arthroscopic rotator cuff ( RC ) repair often associate severe post operative pain discomfort . Many analgesic protocol propose pain relief follow RC repair controversy remain regard optimal postoperative analgesic protocol . Despite significant advancement analgesic technique last decades 50-70 % patient undergo surgical procedure still experience moderate severe postoperative pain . Postoperative pain inflammatory component ( i.e . relate traumatic tissue damage inflammatory reaction due surgical incision procedure ) neuropathic component ( i.e . related sensitization peripheral central nervous system ) . Opioids commonly use postoperative pain reduction , however use associate numerous adverse event limit . Regional nerve block technique emerge past decade become standard practice recently . Recent study indicate single-dose interscalene brachial plexus block ( ISBPB ) effective provide postoperative analgesia follow shoulder surgery , reduces need opioid medication , high success rate ( ≥94 % ) major complication ( ≤0.4 % ) . However , regional nerve blockade , include ISBPS , frequent incidence temporary postoperative neurological symptom within first postoperative week ( 4 -16 % ) , technically demand might time consume . Pregabalin ( Lyrica ) anticonvulsant drug membrane stabilize anti-nociceptive effect commonly use neuropathic pain relief anxiety disorder . It desensitize presynaptic terminal hyperexcited neuron peripheral central nervous system ( i.e . reduces transmission excitatory neurotransmitter include glutamate , norepinephrine , substance P , calcitonin gene-related peptide ) reduce calcium influx high-voltage-activated calcium channel contain alpha2/delta subunit . Pregabalin rapidly absorb gut bioavailability approximately 90 % , achieve peak plasma concentration approximately 1h administration , half-life 6h eliminate renal excretion . Many study past decade evaluate pregabalin roll treatment acute postoperative pain . Pregabalin effect reduce opioid consumption opioid adverse event ( AEs ) well establish . Its analgesic effect acute postoperative pain remain questionable , study still require compare pregabalin analgesic potential standard post-operative analgesic regimen . Pregabalin dos use previous study range 75 600 mg give single dose 1-2h preoperatively without additional dos 12h 24h postoperatively . Doses 150 mg high seem offer good result term postoperative analgesia opioids spar . However high dos associate high rate AEs , mainly sedation , dizziness visual disturbance . Nervous system desensitization oral medication ( e.g . pregabalin ) rather invasive mean ( e.g . ISBPB ) may reduce adverse reaction , increase patient satisfaction save valuable time operation theater . To investigator knowledge previous study compare efficacy pregabalin ISBPB acute pain relief follow arthroscopic shoulder surgery . The investigator hope contribute discussion regard optimal pain relief method follow arthroscopic shoulder surgery .</brief_summary>
