	<detailed_description>Algorithm drive closed-loop enables automate subcutaneous delivery insulin response real-time continuous glucose sensor reading . Our study date assess safety efficacy closed-loop insulin delivery patient type 1 diabetes control setting . For patient type 2 diabetes treat diet non-insulin glucose-lowering medication alone , episode acute illness may result elevate glucose level necessitate initiation insulin replacement therapy optimise glycaemic control . Insulin may also require patient prior history diabetes , present 'stress hyperglycaemia ' . Closed-loop system may benefit insulin-naive patient optimal dose regimen difficult establish , may provide safe method insulin delivery add benefit continuous monitoring glucose level general hospital ward , thus minimise likelihood hyper- hypoglycaemic event know associated bad outcome . The study open-label , randomise , two-period crossover design . Participants randomise undergo two 24-hour study clinical research facility , glucose level control either computer-based closed-loop algorithm ( intervention ) patient ' usual non-insulin glucose-lowering diabetes treatment regimen ( control ) . A continuous glucose sensor insert arrival visit . Participants consume regular meal ( match visit ) carry daily activity mimic occur inpatient setting . Stable glucose isotope administer two study occasion collect data model glucose turnover around meal overnight period .</detailed_description>
