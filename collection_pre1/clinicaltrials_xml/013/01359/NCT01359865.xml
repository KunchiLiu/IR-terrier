	<detailed_description>To compare analgesia orthopedic rehabilitation milestone patient receive either spinal anesthesia ( local anesthetic plus opioid ) general endotracheal anesthesia lumbar plexus block . : Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) common surgery worldwide . Despite prevalence procedure , `` gold standard '' anesthetic . Several different technique utilize . The two common anesthesia modality : 1 ) spinal anesthesia 2 ) general anesthesia ( without peripheral nerve block ) . The choice anesthetic technique often base train experience anesthesia provider , well culture institution . Both spinal anesthesia ( consist local anesthetic opioid ) general anesthesia ( combine lumbar plexus nerve block ) provide adequate intra-operative anesthesia well prolonged post-operative analgesia . The goal study determine choice one two anesthetic technique influence postoperative pain score orthopedic rehabilitation marker patient undergo primary THA . Several study compare spinal versus general anesthesia term post-operative pain relief , nausea vomiting , blood loss , deep venous thrombosis . Most study utilize lumbar plexus nerve block postoperative analgesia general anesthesia subject . The investigator aware randomize , control study examine difference orthopedic outcome THA perform spinal anesthesia general anesthesia lumbar plexus nerve block . These two anesthetic technique result different degree intraoperative muscle relaxation may affect post-operative range motion . Analgesic difference two technique may also affect range motion post-operative ambulation . The investigator propose compare post-operative pain score primary outcome patient receive either spinal anesthesia ( bupivicaine morphine ) general anesthesia lumbar plexus block THA . Orthopedic outcome , include distance first ambulation , physical therapy range motion , limb length discrepancy measure secondary outcome . Continuous pulse oximetry capnograpahy data record 24 hour postoperatively patient . The incidence urinary tract infection post-operative nausea vomit group additional measure outcome .</detailed_description>
