	<brief_summary>Background : Type II diabetes disease affect 246 million people worldwide . Most importantly , one complication type II diabetes kidney damage lead many patient seek hemodialysis treatment , type kidney replacement therapy . However , hemodialysis treatment , many patient greatly risk blood sugar drop normal lead neurological problem . Also , report hemodialysis patient poorer control blood glucose level risk develop heart problem . It show add 5.5 mmol/L glucose hemodialysis treatment reduce chance abnormal decrease blood glucose level . Currently , institution use 10 mmol/L glucose ( instead 5.5 mmol/L ) hemodialysis treatment , however , little documented support justify action . Objective : The investigator would like explore effect use 10 mmol/L glucose hemodialysis treatment determine worsens control blood glucose level , treatment session long term type II diabetes patient . Also , patient hemodialysis prone infection , also observe change infection rate among patient increase glucose treatment . Methods : The study consist 40 patient randomly split 2 group . One group treat 5.5 mmol/L glucose hemodialysis treatment group 10 mmol/L glucose treatment . During hemodialysis treatment , patient blood glucose measure set interval check acute drop glucose level . Also , assess long-term control blood glucose level , patient 2 blood test , one start another end experiment . Signs infection check start session . Each patient remain group duration study , 12 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Study Design : Randomized-controlled study type 2 DM patient dialysis assess effect two different dialysate glucose concentration , standard 5.5 mmol/L high 10 mmol/L . The study period 20 weeksâ€”4 week recruitment , 12 week intervention 4 week data collection analysis . 2 . Study Population : All patient diabetes type 2 Montreal General Hospital hemodialysis unit , identify Head nurse dialysis unit . The following patient exclude : anticipate transplant within 6 month , expect death due malignancy severe infection within 6 month , uncontrolled blood sugar 20mmol/l unable give consent due neurologic reason . Once head nurse identifies subject , potential subject approach research assistant consent form . All patient consent research assistant write consent form . Then subject randomly assign standard high glucose dialysate group . 3 . Methods ( ) Baseline Data collection standard high glucose dialysate group The following demographic data note : age , gender , duration diabetes , duration dialysis , comorbidity use Charlson Comorbidity index , vascular access type ( arteriovenous fistula permanent catheter ) cause renal failure . The routine previous month ' hemodialysis laboratory test record complete blood count , serum electrolyte , serum glucose , calcium ionized total , phosphate , parathyroid hormone level , iron saturation , C reactive protein , ferritin , lipid serum albumin . No additional blood test take . HbA1c value take every three month , therefore intervention introduce HbA1c value take within month subject . No additional blood test take . Blood pressure stability dialysis treatment also record defined difference pre post mean arterial blood pressure document last three dialysis treatment mean take subject . ( ii ) Intervention After randomization , subject randomize high glucose group flag hemodialysis order , electronic Nephrocare program . Similarly standard glucose solution also flag order subject randomize group . ( iii ) Data collection Study Both study group routine glucometer blood sugar test last hour dialysis . The number intradialytic asymptomatic symptomatic hypoglycemic episode record subject . Outcomes end 12 week intervention : All subject follow record : 1 . Routine monthly blood work Hemoglobin A1c value 2 . Number episodes serum glucose less equal 3 mmol/L use glucometer dialysis treatment 3 . Blood pressure stability dialysis ( mmHg ) 4 . Number infection event 12 week define accord Public Health Agency Canada state :</detailed_description>
