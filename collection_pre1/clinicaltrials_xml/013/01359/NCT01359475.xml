The major drawback poor esthetic along linger concern potential health hazard associate nickel content . Several attempt make improve upon esthetic stainless steel crown veneer buccal occlusal surface substitute composite resin entire crown , date none approach successful . Acetal resin use number application medicine dentistry , recently meet early success test substitute stainless steel crown . It number excellent physical mechanical property include low coefficient friction , good wear resistance , high fatigue resistance , good impact strength resistance creep . The purpose trial compare clinical performance preform acetal resin crown preform stainless steel crown . 2.0 OBJECTIVES The objective study compare clinical performance acetal resin crown preform stainless steel crown use restore primary molar teeth .</brief_summary>
