	<detailed_description>Nicotine dependence typically emerge adolescence . As almost 90 % adult smoker begin adolescence ( Campaign Tobacco Free Kids , 2008 ) , critical develop effective treatment reduce smoking adolescent . Despite substantial research adult , relatively little effort focus treatment reduce adolescent smoking . Current treatment option adolescent smoke broadly categorize behavioral pharmacological approach . Behavioral treatment , contingency management , reduce adolescent smoke significantly control condition ( Grim Shaw Stanton , 2006 ; Sussman et al. , 2006 ) . Notably , pharmacotherapies , nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) also safe efficacious reduce smoking adolescent ( Upadhyaya et al. , 2004 ; Killen et al. , 2004 ; Hurt et al. , 2000 ; Smith et al. , 1996 ) . However , limited knowledge regard combination behavioral intervention pharmacotherapies reduce adolescent smoking ( Hanson et al. , 2003 ; Mollohan et al. , 2005 ) . Combinations behavioral pharmacological treatment efficacious cost-effective reduce smoking adult either approach alone ( Roving et al. , 2009 ; Reus Smith , 2008 ; see review Ingersoll &amp; Cohen 's , 2005 ) . For example , combine treatment nicotine patch `` Progressive-Reinforcement Reset '' contingency management ( CM ) paradigm ( smoker receive escalate monetary reward accord duration abstinence ) increase abstinence smoking significantly nicotine replacement therapy alone adult ( Shoptaw et al. , 2002 ) . Such combination therapy could also effective reduce adolescent smoke individual treatment . Research effort regard hinder , part , expense complexity outpatient trial relative dearth less expensive laboratory procedure assess adolescent smoking . Developing validate laboratory procedure evaluate combine effect CM pharmacological adjunct adolescent smoke important human laboratory study conduct rapidly efficiently clinical trial . Randomized , placebo-controlled clinical trial tend costly , lengthy labor-intensive , reserve promising medication show least level efficacy enhance CM effectiveness control laboratory condition . Laboratory study use adolescent smoker might also identify optimal condition ( e.g. , dose , duration treatment ) pharmacotherapies might expect synergistic CM . This proposal one specific aim : evaluate combine effect CM NRT treatment assess smoking adolescent . Such laboratory paradigm could useful evaluate potential pharmacotherapies augment effect CM adolescent smoker . We propose conduct proof-of-concept study 60 adolescent smoker ( age 13-21 ) participate randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , between-groups , 2-week laboratory study . After intake screening , eligible adolescent smoker randomly assign one follow four group : CM+nicotine patch , CM+placebo patch , noncontingent control ( NC ) +nicotine patch NC+placebo patch . Fifteen participant enrol four group , total 60 participant . Participants ask wear one patch daily duration study . On day 1 , participant arrive laboratory 1-h session . During session , breath carbon monoxide ( CO ) level , saliva urinary cotinine level evaluate . Participants also complete questionnaire crave , withdrawal cigarette dependence . Participants receive seven patch , wear seven day , one patch daily , begin day . Everyday day 8 12 , participant arrive laboratory one hour , end session , apply new patch . Five session day 8 12 serve CM noncontingent session . On session , breath CO level , saliva urinary cotinine level evaluate , participant complete questionnaire crave , withdrawal cigarette dependence . On session , participant opportunity receive payment base CO level , accord group assignment . If successful , propose study provide human laboratory model use study combine CM pharmacological approach modify adolescent smoking behavior .</detailed_description>
