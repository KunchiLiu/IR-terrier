	<brief_summary>This study test doctor , nurse people take care patient hospital wear glove gown contact patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) : - Decrease chance patient get infection hospital - Decrease chance patient pick bacteria result hospital - Decrease time patient spends ICU hospital - Increase frequency adverse event The study also look whether make doctor , nurse people take care patient wear glove gown contact patient decrease amount time healthcare worker spend patient . This study gather information comparing happen ICUs continue study happen ICUs require healthcare worker wear glove gown contact patient . This study provide information help make hospital safer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits Universal Glove Gowning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GOAL : The overall goal project determine effectiveness universal glove gowning procedure reduce healthcare-associated infection ( HAI ) rate acquisition antibiotic-resistant bacteria Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . More specifically , project require cluster-randomized trial ( CRT ) design conduct compare effect universal glove gown procedure compare current standard care ICUs . STUDY DESIGN : The study two arm , cluster-randomized trial . Randomization analysis perform ICU level . A secondary statistical analysis perform patient level . STUDY POPULATION : Adult patient medical , surgical combine medical/surgical ICUs . SAMPLE SIZE : Based power calculation present Appendix I CRT aim , study use least 18 ICU site , half universal gown glove intervention half CDC standard care . We seek maximize number ICUs involve improve scientific value study . The study presently power 1-year intervention study 18 ICUs include . After 2 month pre-randomization period , use actual number site enrol baseline estimate see achieve degree power study intervention less year . We able recruit retain 20 ICU site . Upon completion pre-randomization period base upon revised power calculation complete 9-month intervention . RANDOMIZATION : Randomization pair match base baseline data collection outcome use . DATA ANALYSIS : Analyses aim perform accord intention-to-treat ( ITT ) paradigm ICU level accommodate matched-pairs design . INTERVENTION : Aim 1 : Perform CRT healthcare worker intervention ICUs wear glove gown patient contact control unit perform regular standard contact precaution per CDC guideline respective ICUs . Aim 1a : Measure colonization acquisition rate antibiotic-resistant pathogen intervention non-intervention ICUs . Aim 1b : Measure HAI rate catheter-associated bloodstream infection , catheter-associated urinary tract infection ventilator-associated pneumonia intervention non-intervention ICUs . Aim 1c : Measure in-hospital 30-day mortality intervention non-intervention ICUs . Aim 1d : Measure hospital length stay intervention non-intervention ICUs . Aim 1e : Measure frequency adverse event include frequency healthcare worker visit frequency adverse event use IHI adverse event tool . Aim 1f : Statistically determine whether intervention effective decrease acquisition antibiotic-resistant bacteria ( primary outcome ) , reduce HAI rate ( secondary outcome ) , decrease in-hospital 30-day mortality ( secondary outcome ) , decrease length stay ( secondary outcome ) increase adverse event ( secondary outcome ) . HYPOTHESES : Hypothesis 1a : Healthcare worker wear glove gowns patient contact ICU set reduce antibiotic-resistant pathogen acquisition at-risk patient . Hypothesis 1b : Healthcare worker wear glove gowns patient contact ICU set decrease HAI rate . Hypothesis 1c : Healthcare worker wear glove gowns patient contact ICU set decrease 30-day mortality . Hypothesis 1d : Healthcare worker wear glove gowns patient contact ICU set decrease hospital length stay . Hypothesis 1e : Healthcare worker wear glove gowns patient contact ICU set lead increase adverse event . CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION : Primary Outcome : The primary outcome interest acquisition antibiotic-resistant pathogen , specifically Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus ( VRE ) Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( MRSA ) , determine peri-anal surveillance culture VRE nasal surveillance culture MRSA . The outcome analyze individually collectively ( i.e. , VRE , MRSA VRE MRSA ) . Acquisition define : 1 . A patient initial ICU surveillance culture negative antibiotic-resistant pathogen 2 . Any subsequent surveillance culture within ICU admission positive antibiotic-resistant pathogen . Secondary Outcomes : The HAI rate measure consist catheter-associated bloodstream infection , catheter-associated urinary tract infection ventilator-associated pneumonia rate . Hospital length stay 30-day mortality also measure secondary outcome . Adverse event also secondary outcome measure use frequency healthcare worker visit frequency adverse event measure IHI tool .</detailed_description>
