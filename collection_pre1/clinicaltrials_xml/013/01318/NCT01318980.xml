	<detailed_description>GSK2190915 high affinity 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein ( FLAP ) inhibitor attenuate production leukotrienes blockage first step leukotriene pathway , 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LO ) activation . Leukotrienes potent inflammatory molecule produce mainly mast cell , eosinophil , monocytes/macrophage neutrophil response allergic inflammatory stimulus . GSK2190915 inhibit production leukotriene B4 ( LTB4 ) cysteinyl leukotrienes ( cysLTs ) . This open label , 4-way , 4 treatment period , non-randomised , single-dose crossover study interim analysis follow third treatment period . The GSK2190915 formulation use : mill 100mg 200mg tablet , 100mg enteric-coated tablet , [ 14C ] radiolabelled GSK2190915 intravenous solution . There 4 period . Period 1 include two cohort ( 7 subject ) , administer 100mg GSK2190915 mill tablet orally ; however , second cohort addition dose intravenous radiolabelled infusion drug . In second period , 100mg dose mill GSK2190915 tablet ( ground half 200mg tablet ) administer directly proximal small bowel use Enterion capsule . The dose repeat third period , administer directly distal small bowel . An interim analysis follow . The decision proceed make follow review pharmacokinetic data first three treatment . In fourth final period , treatment 100mg enteric-coated tablet GSK2190915 administer orally . There minimum washout 7 day period . This study aim determine pharmacokinetics absolute bioavailability GSK2190915 enable optimisation suitable formulation use clinical development . Periods 1 3 characterise absolute bioavailability GSK2190915 use IV tracer oral formulation , addition define regional absorption characteristic drug release proximal distal part gastro-intestinal tract . The fourth period investigate oral bioavailability enteric coat formulation GSK2190915 . Fourteen subject dose ensure data 10 end clinical study . Seven subject ( cohort 2 , Period 1 ) receive IV microtracer addition treatment .</detailed_description>
