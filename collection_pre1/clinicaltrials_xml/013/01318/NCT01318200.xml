	<brief_title>Transarterial Chemoembolization ( TACE ) vs. CyberKnife Recurrent Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) third deadly cancer world . It primarily see area hepatitis endemic , Asia , risk factor include alcoholic cirrhosis . Surgical resection and/or transplantation remain curative option . However , 80 % patient present unresectable disease . For patient unresectable tumor , variety treatment option available , include transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , radioactive microspheres , microwave coagulation , laser-induced thermotherapy , percutaneous alcohol injection , similar survival rate . Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) unresectable HCC relatively new treatment option make available significant improvement diagnostic image radiation delivery technique . Although follow-up limited , result show encouraging local control rate . Some investigator combine TACE fractionate conventional radiotherapy mean intensify local therapy , evidence efficacy . TACE remain dominant mode local therapy unresectable HCC . However , recurrence rate high . Because SBRT rapidly become accept local therapy hepatic lesion , role treat HCC need define . Moreover , patient recur initial TACE , unclear additional TACE effective another mode local therapy SBRT would preferable . We propose conduct multicenter randomize study compare TACE vs. SBRT use CyberKnife locally recurrent HCC . Locally recurrent HCC include lesion persist , progress recur minimum 3 month initial TACE .</detailed_description>

Hepatic lesion patient surgical resection possible would result opportunity cure . Radiographic evidence persistent , progressive recurrent disease area previously treat TACE . This evaluation determine 6 week initial TACE . Multispecialty evaluation whereby recurrent liver lesion deem attend radiation oncologist interventional radiologist amenable treatment respective modality 1 . Eligible patient must undergo IV contrast CT scan liver within 6 week enrollment onto study ; contrast enhance liver MRI may substitute contrast liver CT 2 . A recent serum AFP must obtain within 4 week enrollment . Unifocal liver tumor exceed 7.5 cm great axial dimension . Multifocal lesion restrict lesion treat within single target volume within liver segment aggregate 7.5 cm long dose constraint normal tissue meet .
