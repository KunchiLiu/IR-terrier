	<brief_title>Research Study ATG Rituximab Renal Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Kidneys remove excess fluid waste blood . When kidney lose filter ability , dangerous level fluid waste accumulate body — condition know kidney failure . There two way treat kidney failure . One way get dialysis indefinitely . The second way get kidney transplant . A kidney transplant often best treatment kidney failure . A kidney transplant surgical procedure place healthy kidney donor person whose kidney long function properly . This study people receive kidney transplant well match , live blood relative . The immune system body 's defense system illness . After transplant , immune system think new kidney foreign invader try attack reject transplant kidney . Immunosuppressive drug protect transplant kidney suppress immune system . People kidney transplant must take immunosuppressive drug rest life . If stop , immune system may reject transplanted kidney . Immunosuppressive drug make hard body fight infection . In addition , cause high blood pressure , kidney damage , plaque build-up blood vessel , high cholesterol , diabetes bone disease . They may also make body likely get type cancer ( mainly cancer white blood cell and/or skin ) serious side effect . Because side effect immunosuppressive drug , important goal transplant research allow people accept transplant organ without always take immunosuppressive drug . This call tolerance . The RESTARRT study test combination two medication , rituximab anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , see help people reduce eliminate need life-long immunosuppressive medication . ATG use 10 year treat transplant rejection ; rituximab use treat rheumatoid arthritis two type cancer . ATG work immune cell call 'T cell ' involve transplant rejection , rituximab work different type cell call ' B cell . ' Researchers hope target cell type time help reset immune system accepts transplant kidney . Frequent visit require first two month study . Then , study visit take place every 4 week , often ( every 2 week ) reduce medication dos . After two year , participant ask return check-ups every 3 month . Study visit may include consultation transplant doctor , physical exam , blood and/or urine sample kidney biopsy several time study . In , participation could last 4 year . All study-related medication test provide charge patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recipient first renal allograft single haplotype match great living relate donor old 65 , second degree relative HLA antigen type consistent single haplotype match recipient . Demonstration absence antiHLA antibody use solid phase micro particle technology ( Luminex® phenotype panel Luminex single antigen bead test ) perform 7 day less prior first dose rituximab , assess local laboratories.No evidence antiHLA antibody current past sera.Negative T‐ B‐cell crossmatch determine flow cytometric assay measure 7 day less prior first dose rituximab , . Single‐organ recipient ( kidney ) . Serologic evidence prior exposure Epstein‐Barr virus ( EBV ) . For woman childbearing potential : negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity le 50 mIU/m within 72 hour start study medication . Use FDA‐approved method contraception ( le 5 % failure rate ) participant time study treatment begin 104 week ( 24 month ) renal transplantation . Ability receive oral medication . Ability understand provide inform consent . Recipient kidney donor old 65 year . History cancer within last 5 year , except nonmelanoma skin cell cancer cure local resection cervical carcinoma situ . Women breastfeed . Uncontrolled hyperlipidemia ( total serum cholesterol 300 mg/dL and/or triglycerides 400 mg/dL ) . Platelet count le 100,000/μL study entry . Seropositivity HIV‐1 , hepatitis C virus ( confirm HCV PCR ) , hepatitis B surface antigen , hepatitis B core antibody ( confirm HBV PCR ) . Active tuberculosis ( TB ) within previous 3 year regardless treatment history TB . Participants know positive purify protein derivative ( PPD ) positive Quantiferon assay eligible study unless complete treatment latent TB negative chest x‐ray time enrollment . PPD test Quantiferon test do within 52 week transplant acceptable long documentation result . Prior recipient Bacille Calmette‐Guérin vaccination ( BCG ) exempt . Underlying renal disease high risk disease recurrence transplant kidney , include focal segmental glomerulosclerosis , type I II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis , hemolytic‐uremic syndrome/thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura . The presence medical condition investigator deem incompatible participation trial . Known sensitivity antithymocyte globulin , rituximab , tacrolimus , sirolimus , MMF , corticosteroid . Current use systemic corticosteroid antibody‐based therapy ( e.g. , infliximab , adalimumab , etanercept ) . Use investigational drug within 30 day transplantation . Receipt live vaccine within 3 month enrollment .</criteria>
