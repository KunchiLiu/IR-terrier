	<brief_summary>Influenza vaccine continuously modify adjust virus antigenic shift drift , safety profile may vary . While generally consider safe , influenza vaccine associate past increase case Guillain-Barré syndrome ( 1976 ) oculorespiratory syndrome 2001 . Last year , vaccination pH1N1 , increase allergic-like reaction observe . Passive surveillance collect notification adverse event ( AE ) whole population sensitivity system high timeliness necessarily optimal . Last year , new pandemic Influenza vaccine investigator pilot web-based active surveillance large number health care worker ( HCW ) vaccinate new adjuvanted monovalent pH1N1 influenza vaccine ( Arepanrix® GSK , Canada ) . Because healthcare worker ( HCW ) constitute well-defined group general good health receive Influenza vaccine priority , group people well suit monitoring safety influenza vaccine . For study , 6242 HCW recruit three different site ( 5183 Quebec ) . A total 468 event ( local reaction , fever , systemic reaction , gastrointestinal respiratory problem ) report 430 HCW . 80 % HCW recruit complete least one three survey 52 % respond questionnaire . During surveillance , investigators n't unexpected finding active surveillance adverse event among healthcare worker would effective enough rapidly detect adverse event occur rate ≥ 1 per 200 vaccinee . For year investigator want expand surveillance sit participant able detect AE occur rate ≥ 1 per 500 vaccinee , increase response rate three survey participant . The main objective project estimate HCW vaccinate influenza frequency adverse event sufficient severity cause work absenteeism medical consultation . This year network include 5 Canadian hospital ( Quebec City , Vancouver , Toronto , Halifax , + another one ) total enrollment &gt; 10 000 HCW . This allow u detect AE occur rate ≥ 1 per 500 vaccinee .</brief_summary>
