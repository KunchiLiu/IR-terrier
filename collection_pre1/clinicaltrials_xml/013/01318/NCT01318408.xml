	<brief_summary>Elderly person dementia risk seizure , however , traditional anticonvulsant poorly tolerate population . Our goal examine Levetiracetam ( Keppra ) elderly dementia patient seizure . While establish Keppra control seizure age group , important demonstrate treatment Keppra would affect cognitive ability large population patient . As population already cognitively impaired , best choice anticonvulsant would one compromise cognitive ability . Keppra excellent anticonvulsant agent elderly variety reason , include safety , favorable side effect profile , lack interaction drug , efficacy . Our retrospective pilot data suggest cognition negatively affect Keppra . The current prospective study assess cognitive ability person cognitive impairment baseline week 4 12 . The overall objective determine cognitive tolerability Keppra seizures elderly cognitively impaired patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , phase 4 , open label , twelve week study . The study consist 4 week titration phase follow 8 week assessment phase . All clinic visit conduct Drexel University College Medicine Department Neurology 219 N. Broad St. , Phila. , PA. Visit one include review sign write informed consent form , obtain relevant demographic data , routine blood work . The baseline frequency , duration type seizures subject experience document , current antiepileptic medication . Baseline history physical neurological examination perform , include vital sign . Testing include baseline measurement cognition , function ( activity daily live ) , behavior . Cognitive test include Folstein 's Minimental State examination ( MMSE ) , ADAS-cog . Our overall assessment include Modified Schwab England Activities Daily Living Scale . Behavioral assessment include Tariot 's Behavior Ratings Scale Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory ( CMAI ; long form ) . Levetiracetam initiate instruction follow give . Because goal cognitive tolerability , Levetiracetam use either add-on agent primary monotherapy . During week two , follow telephone assessment do review instruction determine whether medical change adverse event occur . Adverse event assess direct question spontaneous patient/caregiver report . The date , number , duration type seizures subject experience also document . At third assessment ( week 4 ) , follow physical neurological examination do , include vital sign , mental testing , include test cognition , function behavior repeat . An assessment make determine whether adverse event occur . Adverse event assess review subject 's seizure log , physician observation , direct question spontaneous report . The date , number , duration type seizure subject experience also document . In case levetiracetam add-on agent , attempt taper precede medication seizure control demonstrate . Cognitive test do subject post-ictal state . Any subject seizure generalization within 24 hour schedule test rescheduled another day within one week . At week twelve , full follow mental status assessment do final assessment . Testing do week 1 ( baseline ) 4 . Again , cognitive test do subject post-ictal state . Any subject seizure generalization within 24 hour schedule test reschedule next available day , within one week . Follow blood work screen adverse event also obtain time . Again , adverse event assess review seizure log , physician observation , direct question spontaneous report . The date , number , duration type seizure document .</detailed_description>
