	<criteria>The informed consent must sign studyspecific test procedures do . Female subject childbearing potential ( postmenopausal woman 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea 6 month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH concentration &gt; 30 mIU/mL , woman 6 week post bilateral ovariectomy , woman bilateral tubal ligation , woman hysterectomy ) . Male subject agree use 2 form effective contraception study 12 week receive study drug . This must include condom spermicide gel 21 day drug administration . Male subject agree act sperm donor 12 week dose . Age : ≥18 ≤79 year prestudy visit . Body mass index ( BMI ) : ≥18 ≤34 kg/m2 . Ethnicity : white . • Subjects participate trial receive 20 mg BAY 85 3934 encouraged participate follow optionally 40 mg 80 mg study part . Ability understand follow studyrelated instruction . For subject renal impairment : In diseased subject : CLCR &lt; 90 mL/min determine serum creatinine control . In diseased subject : stable renal disease , ie serum creatinine value determine least 3 month prestudy visit routine diagnostics independently study vary 20 % serum creatinine value determine prestudy visit . For healthy subject : Mean age body weight Group 1 Group 6 Group 11 ( control group , healthy subject ) Groups 2 5 Groups 7 10 Groups 12 15 vary +10 year +10 kg , respectively.. In diseased subject : CLCR ≥90 mL/min determine serum creatinine control . Participation another clinical trial precede 3 month multipledose study 1 month singledose study ; ( final examination previous study first treatment new study ) . Exclusion period study simultaneous participation clinical study . Donation &gt; 100 mL blood within 4 week first study drug administration &gt; 500 mL precede 3 month . Medical disorder would impair subject 's ability complete study opinion investigator . Severe infection clinically significant illness within 4 week prior dose . Known hypersensitivity study drug ( active substance , excipients preparation ) . Known severe allergy , nonallergic drug reaction , multiple drug allergy . Positive result hepatitis B virus surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , hepatitis C virus antibody ( HCV Ab ) , human immune deficiency virus antibody ( HIV 1/2 Ab ) . Regular use recreational drug , eg carnitine product , anabolics . Regular daily consumption ≥ 0.5 L usual beer equivalent quantity approximately 20 g alcohol another form . Suspicion drug alcohol abuse . Positive urine drug screening . Regular daily consumption &gt; 25 cigarette . Criteria opinion investigator preclude participation scientific reason , reason compliance , reason subject 's safety . Use medication within 2 week precede study could interfere investigational product . For subject renal impairment : Acute renal failure . Acute nephritis . Nephrotic syndrome . Any organ transplant &lt; 1 year participation study . Failure major organ system kidney . Relevant impairment liver function option investigator . Preexisting disease assume absorption study drug normal ( ie relevant malabsorption , chronic diarrhea ) . Diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; 100 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &gt; 180 mmHg ( prestudy examination ; reading take end dose interval antihypertensive medication , ) . Heart rate &lt; 45 &gt; 100 BPM subject age 18 ≤50 year &lt; 55 &gt; 110 BPM subject age &gt; 50 ≤79 year screen visit . Significant uncorrected rhythm conduction disturbance second thirddegree AV block without cardiac pacemaker episode sustain ventricular tachycardia , option investigator . Diagnosed malignancy within past 5 year . Psychiatric disorder may disable subject consent . Change chronic medication &lt; 4 week prior dose . Concomitant use medication except medication necessary treatment kidney disease related complication . For healthy subject Subjects conspicuous finding medical history prestudy examination option investigator . A history relevant diseases vital organ , central nervous system organ . Preexisting disease assume absorption , distribution , metabolism , elimination effect study drug normal . Systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg &gt; 145 mmHg . Diastolic blood pressure &gt; 95 mmHg . Heart rate &lt; 45 &gt; 95 BPM subject age 18 ≤50 year &lt; 55 &gt; 95 BPM subject age &gt; 50 ≤79 year screen visit . Clinically relevant finding ECG second thirddegree AV block , clinically relevant prolongation QRS complex &gt; 120 m QTc interval &gt; 450 m men &gt; 470 ms woman option investigator . Clinically relevant deviation screen laboratory parameter clinical chemistry , hematology , urinalysis reference range option investigator .</criteria>
