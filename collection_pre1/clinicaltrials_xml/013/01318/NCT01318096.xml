	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Raltegravir+TDF+3TC HBV/HIV Co-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There total 72939 HIV infected people report Yunnan , large number province China . About 800 HIV inpatient admit hospital every year , amongst 10 % co-infected HBV . HIV HBV co-infection patient must receive two drug active HIV HBV , example Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) + lamivudine ( 3TC ) TDF+FTC . TDF 3TC nucleotide analogue inhibit HIV HBV DNA polymerase ( Dore , Cooper et al . 2004 ) . Combination therapy could decrease drug resistance . In China , TDF second-line drug national free ART program ; however FTC list free drug . There likely high risk cause drug resistance treat HBV HIV infection 3TC TDF monotherapy combination therapy . Raltegravir inhibit catalytic activity HIV-1 integrase , significantly inhibit human phosphoryl transferase include DNA polymerase α , β , γ , may less adverse effect . In chronic HBV infection , HBV-DNA integrate human DNA result difficulty eradicate HBV patient 's body . In pilot study , investigator would examine safety efficacy integrase inhibitor-Raltegravir control HIV/HBV co-infection .</detailed_description>
