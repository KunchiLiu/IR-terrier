	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect approximately one fourth world population therefore contribute substantially worldwide burden cardiovascular ( CV ) disease end-organ damage ( 1 ) . Therefore , goal antihypertensive therapy provide effective long-term lowering elevate blood pressure ( BP ) prevention hypertensive end-organ-damage mortality ( 2 ) . Changes small artery structure characterize increase wall-to-lumen ratio ( WLR ) characteristic feature target organ damage hypertension . ( 3 ; 4 ) . A clinical study examine small artery obtain gluteal biopsy patient hypertension reveal increase WLR subcutaneous small artery one first manifestation target organ damage hypertension occur proteinuria cardiac hypertrophy ( 5 ) . Of clinical importance , structural artery small subcutaneous artery show prognostic significance , adverse prognosis subject high WLR ( 6-8 ) . However , assessment arteriolar structure biopsy subcutaneous tissue invasive impractical clinical practice . A new approach focus retinal arteriolar structural parameter use scan laser Doppler flowmetry ( SLDF ) automatic full-field perfusion imaging analysis ( 9 ) . This approach allow non-invasive assessment outer diameter inner diameter retinal arteriole vivo , thus , analyse vascular remodel retinal arteriole calculate WLR = ( outer diameter - inner diameter ) / inner diameter ) ( 10 ) . In previous study , could demonstrate treated hypertensive patient poor BP control great WLR retinal arteriole good blood pressure control . Interestingly , cohort find significant relation BP WLR retinal arteriole use correlation analysis . We conclude lack relation might well result effect antihypertensive drug beneficially influence vascular structure ( 9 ) . Subsequently , analyze WLR retinal arteriole cohort never-treated patient essential hypertension normotensive control . In cohort , systolic BP diastolic BP significantly relate WLR retinal arteriole independent traditional CV risk factor confounders , e.g . subclinical inflammation , endothelial dysfunction dietary salt intake . Moreover , cohort , WLR retinal arteriole great hypertensive normotensive subject ( 11 ) . A crucial role effort prevention end-organ damage play renin angiotensin system ( RAS ) due dual role salt water homeostasis ( blood pressure ) vascular response injury . The increased mechanical strain vasculature high BP cause injury endothelial wall . Activation RAS increase BP stimulate local inflammatory response repair injury . Long-term repeat response injury lead endothelial dysfunction microvascular damage ( 12 ) , hence end-organ damage . Therefore increase evidence suppressing , antihypertensive medication inhibit RAS may provide incremental end-organ protection . Recently , show hypertensive patient impaired vasodilatory response retinal arteriole Flickerlight test - improve treatment Angiotensin Receptor Blockers ( ARBs ) - reduce nitric oxide ( NO ) activity retinal circulation , normalize treatment ARBs ( 13 ; 14 ) . Likewise , previous study analyze arterial resistance vessel also systemic circulation find contrast diuretic placebo , valsartan improve endothelial function vascular property ( estimate pulse wave anlalysis ) ( 15 ; 16 ) . Combining RAS inhibitor may provide great end-organ protection use either class alone . However , Ongoing Telmisartan Alone Combination Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial ( ONTARGET ) fail show superiority dual RAS blockade ( Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ARB ) patient high cardiovascular risk ( 17 ) . The combination ARBs direct renin inhibitor ( DRIs ) emerge available , valid innovative option block RAS two different site ( sequential blockade ) . Indeed , Aliskiren Evaluation Proteinuria Diabetes ( AVOID ) study ( 18 ) Aliskiren Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ( ALLAY ) study ( 19 ) demonstrate DRI aliskiren additional extent blood pressure independent effect albuminuria leave ventricular hypertrophy , sign subclinical organ damage hypertension , respectively ( 20 ) . However , data available respect effect ARBs DRIs vascular property short long term To close gab focus study vascular structural functional change since vascular adaptation high blood pressure occur early phase hypertensive disease .</detailed_description>
