	<brief_summary>In study effect nicotine challenge brain activity , behavior mood evaluate two group healthy volunteer smoke habbit : The first group undergo series treatment NicVax , aim produce nicotine antibody body prevent nicotine enter brain . The second group receive placebo treatment . This pre-treatment ( vaccination ) take place 18-week period . All participant undergo two day test . On day subject perform number psychomotor memory test challenge nicotine ( gum ) placebo ( gum ) . Also brain activity study fMRI scanner . We expect see effect brain activation performance placebo-vaccinated group . The Nicvax vaccinate group show activation performance comparable challenge placebo ( gum ) group nicotine cross blood brain barrier enter brain</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Fmri Study Effects Conjugate Vaccine Placebo CNS Activation Behavior Following Nicotine Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : To develop effective treatment nicotine addiction public health priority . In order well understanding need mechanisms 1 ) underlie nicotine addiction 2 ) way treatment alter way nicotine transiently permanently alter multiple cognitive executive function . Most effect nicotine Central Nervous System ( CNS ) directly mediate nicotine molecule . Treatment 3'aminomethylnicotine P. aeruginosa r-Exoprotein A Conjugate Vaccine ( NicVAX™ ) stimulate production nicotine specific antibody . These antibody bind small nicotine molecule , prevent cross Blood Brain Barrier ( BBB ) thus prevent CNS stimulation . A nicotine challenge give vaccination show diminish direct effect nicotine CNS stimulation . The block effect nicotine specific antibody evaluate several cognitive task reactivity smoking-related cue . Objective : Main aim ; show NicVAX attenuate nicotine induce CNS effect brain activation cognitive performance relative placebo . The secondary aim evaluate change CNS stimulation alter subjective measure addictive property nicotine . Study design : within-subject cross-over double-blind placebo control study . Study population : 48 current smoker , male , age 25-40 , least smoke 10 cigarette /day last year , general good health . Additional criterion ; 1 ) No contra-indications MRI 2 ) No history cognitive deficit brain trauma 3 ) No use psychoactive medication 4 ) No contra-indications nicotine gum . Intervention ( applicable ) : The group randomize two sub-populations . 1 ) 28 volunteer receive five injection 3'aminomethylnicotine P. aeruginosa r-Exoprotein A Conjugate Vaccine ( NicVAX™ ) , 2 ) 20 smoker receive five injection placebo . On test day group give nicotine challenge ; chew gum either contain nicotine ( 2mg ) placebo . Main study parameters/endpoints : correlation nicotine specific antibody 1 ) BOLD response rest state , smoking-cue reactivity paradigm task performance ; region interest associate specific task ; 2 ) number correct response reaction time ; 3 ) correlation nicotine specific antibody subjective sign nicotine addiction , measure several questionnaire . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : participant complete medical screening questionnaire ( 15-30 min ) undergo medical screening ( 45 min ; 2 blood sample , urine sample electrocardiogram ) . Informed consent obtain . All participant vaccinate NicVAX Placebo 5 time day 0 , 28 , 56 , 84 112 ( 4 week injection ) During training session ( Day 0 ; ±1,5 hour ) inclusion/exclusion criterion baseline laboratory result review ensure change participant health eligibility status occur since Screening Visit . Participants randomize receive either one dose NicVAX 400µ 1 ml placebo intramuscular . The cognitive fMRI task train dummy scanner , questionnaire complete . Subsequent vaccination ( day 28 , 56 , 84 112 ) give alternate deltoid muscle . Participants observe 60 minute monitor possible adverse event . Adverse event , vital sign concomitant medication record . During test session ( day 133 , 140 ) participant complete 5 questionnaire ( 30 minute total ) perform several cognitive task inside fMRI scanner ( scan session total ~85 min ) . The last test session ( day 140 ) three blood sample ( 5-8 ml ) take nicotine-specific antibody assessment monitor change . In total study take 18 hour complete . The participant pay 10 euro/hr compensation . The risk vaccination , fMRI scan administration nicotine 2mg gum ( deliver dose approximately 1-1.5 mg nicotine bloodstream ) negligible carefully screen participant . The nicotine specific-antibody vaccine clinically test several occasion ; safety profile favourable . Local reactogenicity generally mild moderate subside spontaneously . Vaccinated subject high antibody level ( top 30 % ) smoke less cigarette per day report high abstinence rate placebo subject , establish proof-of-concept . The group receive vaccine could therefore theory reduce smoking/exposure tobacco smoke consequential health benefit .</detailed_description>
