	<detailed_description>Study Design Setting : This single-center , prospective , randomize , double-blind , clinical trial perform ED tertiary care hospital annual census approximately 37.000 visit . The local ethic committee approve study . Two treatment option , intravenous paracetamol morphine , compare cease pain patient present renal colic . Selection Participants : Patients , age 18 55 year , flank pain accept eligible study . Patients clinical diagnosis acute renal colic declare moderate serious pain accord 4-point verbal scale include study . Exclusion criterion follow : patient deny give inform consent , use analgesic within six hour ED presentation , patient fewer hemodynamically unstable , peritoneal irritation sign , cardiac failure , history renal hepatic failure , prior know allergy paracetamol morphine , suspect documented pregnancy patient view problem . Patients suspect renal colic ultimately diagnosis renal abscess , renal infarction renal venous thrombosis also exclude study . Consecutive patient enrol study 24 hour day seven day week senior resident shift . The ultimate diagnosis renal colic perform display stone either ultrasonograph ( USG ) computerize tomography ( CT ) . USG first choice detect renal stone . CT perform stone detect USG . After CT , patient show urolithiasis pathology renal colic exclude study . Interventions : Study subject randomize order receive single dose either paracetamol ( Perfalgan , Bristol Myers Squibb , Itxassou , France ) , 1 gr 100 ml normal saline , morphine ( 0.1 mg/kg 100 ml normal saline ) blind fashion . The study drug write paper fold four time cover sealed band allocation concealment . The study nurse withdraw one drug box . And prepared study nurse administer second nurse blind study . Study drug identical color appearance . Subjects need rescue drug inadequate pain relief receive fentanyl 1 μg/kg intravenously . Methods Measurements : Subjects report pain intensity 100-mm visual analogue scale ( limited 'no pain ' 'the bad pain ' ) 4-point verbal rating scale ( pain , mild , moderate , severe pain ) drug administration , 15th minute 30th minute study drug administration . The demographic feature study patient adverse effect , nausea , vomit , dizziness , vertigo , headache , hypotension , alter mental status , allergic reaction , itching , urinary retention , thoracic rigidity , respiratory depression dry mouth , record study form . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure pain reduction VAS VRS 15th 30th minute . Secondary outcome measure need rescue drug presence adverse event . Primary Data Analysis : The present study plan superiority trial . When 20 mm difference VAS accept clinically significant standard deviation accept 25 mm , 35 patient need group 95 % power . All analysis implement accord intention treat analysis . The precise difference time interval within group group statistical significance express 95 % confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) . All test significance two side .</detailed_description>
