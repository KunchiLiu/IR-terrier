	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose genetically engineer lymphocyte therapy see well work peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) treat patient high-risk , intermediate-grade , B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) . Genetically engineer lymphocyte therapy may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Giving rituximab together chemotherapy PBSCT stop growth cancer cell stop divide kill . Giving colony-stimulating factor , filgrastim ( G-CSF ) , plerixafor help stem cell move bone marrow blood collect store . More chemotherapy radiation therapy give prepare bone marrow stem cell transplant . The stem cell return patient replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy . Giving genetically engineer lymphocyte therapy PBSCT may effective treatment NHL</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety cellular immunotherapy utilize ex vivo expand autologous central memory T cell ( TCM ) -enriched cluster differentiation ( CD ) 8+ T cell genetically-modified express CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) conjunction standard myeloablative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( aHSCT ) research participant high-risk intermediate grade B-lineage non-Hodgkin lymphoma relapse primary therapy , achieve complete remission primary therapy . ( Phase I ) II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) describe full toxicity profile . ( Phase I ) III . To determine rate research participant receive TCM-enriched CD8+ T cell genetically-modified express CD19-specific CAR transfer cell detect circulation 28 day ( +/- 3 day ) woodchuck hepatitis virus post-transcriptional regulatory element ( WPRE ) quantitative ( Q ) -polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tempo , magnitude , duration engraftment transfer T cell product relate number cell infuse . ( Phase II ) II . To study impact therapeutic intervention development CD19+ B-cell precursor bone marrow surrogate vivo effector function transfer CD19-specific T cell . ( Phase II ) III . To describe progression-free overall survival treat research participant protocol . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study genetically engineer lymphocyte therapy follow phase II study . Patients receive standard salvage chemotherapy per standard practice undergo standard mobilization stem cell collection filgrastim and/or plerixafor . Some patient may also receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) within 4 week transplant . Patients receive standard myeloablative conditioning follow autologous PBSCT . Patients undergo infusion ex vivo expand autologous TCM-enriched CD8+ T cell express CD19-specific CAR day 2 3 transplant . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically least 15 year .</detailed_description>
