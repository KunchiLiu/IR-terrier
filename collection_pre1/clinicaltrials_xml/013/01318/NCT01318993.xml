It estimate approximately 800 subject enrol total . All subject enter study baseline ( Week 0 ) commence oral treatment GSK1605786A 500 mg twice daily . The study conduct 108 week . Once result induction study CCX114151 know , risk-to-benefit ratio re-assessed study duration may amend . Study assessments Crohn 's disease perform every 12 week Week 108 . At week 12 , investigator make determination whether subject receive clinical benefit , subject receive clinical benefit must withdraw .
