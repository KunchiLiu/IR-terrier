	<detailed_description>This clinical research project odontologic special field ; periodontology . Periodontitis affect &gt; 50 % person 40 years-of-age , whereof 5 - 10 % prone loose one teeth due disease . In Norway , less 40 % periodontal treatment cost carry ( refund ) public . The proportion personal expense vs. public spending depend serious periodontitis diagnose , individual treatment provide . In addition come expense connect restoration dentition teeth lose consequence disease , therefore social , personal economical consequence serious tooth loss devastate patient . Background establish knowledge Periodontal disease family bacterial infection characterize destruction periodontal support tissue . The bacterial flora diseased site complex , count &gt; 500 different specie subgingival dental plaque . Three main hypothesis exist explain infectious nature periodontal disease ; non-specific infection hypothesis ( Theilade 1986 ) , specific infection hypothesis ( Slots Rams 1991 , Loesche 1992 ) ecological plaque hypothesis ( Marsh 1994 ) . Dental biofilm important factor periodontal health disease ( review : Socransky Haffajee 2002 ) , correct word term plaque . Most biofilms biologically compatible health , formation influence selective pressure host organism . It also great practical interest bacteria organize biofilms highly resistant antibiotic compare planktonic state . In development dental biofilms , host receives bacteria different property close relative others , depend living condition ( Tinoco et al 1998 ) . If pathogenic bacteria among , possibility develop periodontitis increase ( Preus et al 1995 ) . This indicate periodontal treatment must aim break ecology pathogenic biofilm , increase organism ' ability perform selective pressure , follow treatment , make new biofilm low , free pathogenic microorganism . Traditional Treatment strategy far aim prevent retard progression disease mechanical , non-specific treatment , succeed certain extent . Scaling root planing ( SRP ) standard treatment , aim mechanically reduce number bacteria present affected root surface . Representing non-specific form treatment non-specific infection , proven effective case short follow ups ( Hill et al 1981 , Pihlstrøm et al 1983 , Lindhe et al 1984 , Becker et al 1990 , Kaldahl et al 1993 ) . However , recurrence rate fairly high , suggest disease life-long trait . Also , small - still significant - group patient show remain inflammation continuous destruction periodontal support despite adequate oral hygiene proper mechanical treatment ( Lang et al 1986 , Greenstein &amp; Caton 1990 , Walker et al 1993 , Bragd et al 1987 , Renvert et al 1990 , Haffajee et al 1991 , Grossi et al 1994 , Slots Rams 1991 , Socransky Haffajee 1992 ) . Scaling root planing ( SRP ) Adjunctive systemic antibiotic suggest order prohibit remain destructive infection ( Van Winkelhoff et al 1996 ) . The antibiotic preferably choose base microbiological diagnosis suggest pathogenic bacterial resistance profile ( Mombelli AW &amp; van Winkelhoff AJ 1997 , Preus &amp; Laurel 2003 ) . However , treatment report varying effect clinical study ( Joyston-Bechal et al 1986 , Lindhe et al 1983a , Lindhe et al 1983b , Bain et al 1994 , Tinoco et al 1997 , Ciancio et al 1982 , Chavez et al 1995 , Mahmod &amp; Dolby 1987 ) . Thus , adjunct antibiotic seem effective/ineffective reduce number recurrent infection SRP . Normally antibiotic administer end mechanical treatment , cover sometimes - sometimes less - treatment period . Bearing mind biofilms ' ability resist antibiotic , clear dental biofilms , bacteria easily/not affected treatment antibiotic involve . This possibly explain SRP adjunct antibiotic treatment - accord literature - give good result SRP alone . SRP Full-mouth disinfection ( FDIS ) introduce increase success rate SRP . FDIS adjunct therapy whereby scale root planing perform within 48 hour time frame reduce possibility re-infection treat root surface . Chlorhexidine use disinfectant addition mechanical treatment . In series pilot study FDIS ( Quirynen et al 1995 , 1999 , 2000 , 2006 , Bollen et al 1996 ) report amazingly good result . On hand , Apatzidou et al , b , c , ( 2004 ) , Koshy et al ( 2005 ) Wennström et al ( 2005 ) could find improvement FDIS conventional therapy . New treatment strategy Non-specific part ; Traditional SRP reduce bacterial load disrupt/destroy biofilm , reduce size `` window opportunity '' re-infection scale /removing biofilms site ( healthy/not healthy ) within 8 hour . All site scale , healthy diseased . Additional FDIS reduce amount bacteria oral cavity level possible handle antibiotic use . Specific part ; Microbiological diagnosis antibiotic therapy adjunctive SRP/FDIS . Re-establishing beneficial protective biofilm : FDIS rinse CHX brush tongue CHX gel 7 day treatment . Change tooth brush day treatment restrict possible re-inoculation , particular day . Working hypothesis There difference long term clinical microbiological outcome group patient treat SRP/FDIS SRP without Metronidazole . Treatment outcome measure recurrence rate individual well group level . ( see definition end-point evaluation - p6 ) , include sit 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 5 year follow . `` No difference '' consistent nil-hypothesis . Power calculation : This calculation base end point `` attachment level ( AL ) '' , either measure roentgenogram ( RAL ) clinically ( CAL ) measurable basis `` recurrence periodontal disease '' = loss attachment treatment . Based result similar publish study assume standard deviation AL treatment group approximately 1.5 mm . A two-sample t-test apply comparing average AL two treatment group give time point , 5 % significance level . Further , consider difference average AL two treatment group clinically significant least 1.0 mm . In order least 80 % probability demonstrate statistically significant difference average AL two treatment group , give true difference least 1.0 mm , least 36 patient must available statistical analysis group . We expect 10 % patient drop study 5 year follow-up period , exclude possibility drop-out rate high 20 % . At least 44 patient include treatment group . 176 ( i.e.180 ) males female 30 - 60 years-of-age refer specialist clinic Bø Telemark . No interactive disease periodontal disease willing participate signing informed consent . Patients &gt; 4 pocket 5 - 8mm deep , bacterial diagnosis indicate use Metronidazole ( prohibit difference due antibiotic choice ) . Included patient know allergy ill-reaction drug . Microbiological diagnosis perform PCR culture second microbiological `` shadow-test '' perform parallel microbiological service . The primary microbiological diagnosis base culture PCR sample obtain curette . Therapy ( appendix 2 - Time Table ) Patient screen , oral hygiene bring standard hygienist ( TP ) . Eligibility , Indexes microbiological diagnosis record project leader ( HP ) . If willing participate study , patient randomly assign 4 different group secretary/ project coordinator ( N ) . Group 1 ; One-day SRP/FDIS antibiotic , Group 2 ; One-day SRP/FDIS placebo , Group 3 ; SRP 2 week ( scale day 1 14 ) antibiotic , Group 4 ; SRP 2 week ( scale day 1 14 ) placebo . Treatment baseline perform protocol ( TP ) l , maintenance control record index microbiological diagnosis perform 3 month , 1 , 3 5 year post-treatment ( HP ) . All data , Measurements , microbiological diagnosis response questionnaires send CodeBookMaster ( PG ) follow measure session . Reliability test measurer ( HP ) every 12 month . Microbiology I ; Microbiological diagnosis perform treatment follow . This do clinical laboratory ( Telelab , Skien ) offer service Oral microbiology . Microbiology II : Concomitantly every sample take processed parallel sample obtain PBS . These sample process Dr Gunnar Dahlen Gothenburg use chequerboard . End Point evaluation - Choice Method/indexes Periodontal disease inflammatory , infectious disease destroy tooth attachment include bone fibre . Treatment aim halt retard destruction . At 3 month , 1 , 3 5 year CAL RAL parameter periodontal disease PD/BoP parameters inflammation evaluate statistically treat group . Pocket Depth ( PD ) bleed probe ( BoP ) surrogate parameter disease define `` loss attachment include bone '' . Periodontitis measure CAL Xrays = RAL . Since periodontal disease seem recur 3 - 4 year , suggest 5 year follow-up-study . Blinding I : To Project Leader one performs measurement , randomization group hide since research Coordinator ( N ) . N also keep track time schedule , appointment etc . A separate record patient name study number ( 1 - 160 ) keep N lock separate cabinet patient record . At measure appointment measurement send N code book master log measurement SPSS program statistical evaluation . Blinding II : To patient well hygienist , mechanical treatment patient get reveal since physically impossible hide fact treat one day , others 14 day . However , placebo/antibiotic treatment ensure blind patient hygienist . Thus total blinding apply project leader/measurer .</detailed_description>
