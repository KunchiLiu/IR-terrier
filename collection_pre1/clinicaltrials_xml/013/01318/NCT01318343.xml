	<brief_title>Analysis CoolSculpting Zeltiq Non-Invasive Cooling Abdominal Fat Using eZ App Large Applicator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Zeltiq Cooling Device use study ( i.e , CLN1 ) design non-invasively cool skin subcutaneous fat . The device provide cool control preset level ( i.e. , temperature ) define pre-programmed treatment profile provide continuous feedback temperature cool plate interface skin . The device also able provide warm control variable , preset temperature . The cooling device include applicator , component use apply cool warm treatment site , control unit house system controller , power source , hardware . Each applicator comprise least two thermoelectric cooler aluminum plate primary skin interface cool warm . The thermoelectric cooler control powered thermoelectric cooler controller part control system . The device allow well-controlled temperature apply maintain surface treatment area . The Zeltiq Aesthetics Cooling Device use study one applicator configuration . The vacuum applicator , include small amount vacuum pressure create massage effect . A disposable sleeve provide use applicator provide interface applicator skin . Sensors include disposable sleeve measure temperature interface provide feedback ensure appropriate control applicator temperature . For protection subject , safety feature incorporate device avoid unexpected excursion temperature . The device automatically terminate procedure measure temperature exceed minimum maximum program temperature one degree , i.e. , 1ºC colder minimum program cooling temperature 1ºC warmer maximum programmed temperature . Furthermore , device test extensively prior make available use clinical study . Electrical safety test establish standard ( IEC-60601 , UL-2601 ) perform extensive testing perform demonstrate device temperature reproducibility . Biocompatibility test performed material contact treatment site . The study intend evaluate large applicator Zeltiq Aesthetics non-invasive cooling device evaluate treatment low abdomen determine non-invasive cold exposure consistently result reduction fat use clinician environment represent routine clinical practice .</detailed_description>
