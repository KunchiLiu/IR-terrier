	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer fourth commonly diagnose malignant disease worldwide , estimate 1,023,000 new case 529,000 death year . The liver frequent site metastatic spread colorectal cancer , 25 % colorectal cancer patient liver metastasis time initial colorectal resection 50 % colorectal cancer patient develop liver metastasis course disease . The current standard care potential curative therapy colorectal liver metastases liver resection metastatic lesion . Surgical resection provide long term survival patient colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) liver metastasis . In report 1001 patient metastatic colorectal cancer Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center NY , USA , surgical resection liver metastasis result 3- 5-year survival rate 37 % 22 % , respectively . Advances pre- intra-operative imaging chemotherapy recent year increase overall survival 60 % 5 year liver resection . However , 80-90 % liver metastases unresectable time diagnosis usually due tumor location , multifocality , inadequate functional hepatic reserve patient 's overall condition . For patient , harbor unresectable liver metastasis , alternative treatment approach include neoadjuvant chemotherapy , local ablation therapy stereotactic radiation therapy . The recent availability neoadjuvant chemotherapeutic agent increase response rate double median overall survival time metastatic colorectal cancer 10 20 month . Recent study demonstrate neoadjuvant therapy allow 12.5 % patient unresectable CRC liver metastases significantly downstaged eligible hepatic resection . For unresectable CRC liver metastasis , local ablative therapy widely apply . Local ablative treatment refers variety intervention technique specifically target tumor directly destroy . Numerous method ablation develop include cryoablation , percutaneous ethanol injection , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) stereotactic radiation therapy . The widely employ non-radiation base local ablative treatment RFA induce thermal ablation pass high-frequency alternate current tumor utilize electrode place within tumor surround tissue . RFA apply percutaneously ultrasonic guidance directly laparoscopy open laparotomy . Local recurrence rate 44.4 % 18 month report Solbiati et al . CRC liver metastases median diameter 2.6 cm . For tumor great 4 cm local recurrence rate 68 % . RFA overall 3-year survival rate 28-46 % 5-year survival rate 25 % . However , patient advance hepatic decompensation , large tumor ( 3 5 cm ) , multifocal tumor generally consider poor candidate RFA . Conventional radiation therapy show useful palliation hepatic capsular pain , historically play minor role treatment patient unresectable liver metastasis . This attribute chiefly low tolerance whole liver radiation . The liver think relatively radiosensitive organ whole liver irradiation , difficult achieve radiation dos necessary eradicate gross tumor without cause radiation induce liver disease . Partial liver irradiation show promise . Limiting irradiation one-third liver three-dimensional ( 3D ) conformal radiotherapy technique , include intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) , several study show partial liver irradiation safe dose 50-72.6 Gy . However , dose escalation conventional radiation therapy technique risk injury adjacent abdominal organ . Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy ( SBRT ) emerge novel approach local ablation liver metastasis . SBRT provide conformal isodose distribution steep radiation dose gradient allow much high dos radiation conventional radiation therapy conformal radiotherapy technique deliver safely high precision focal liver metastasis minimize radiation dose normal liver adjacent organ . To achieve , precise localization target treatment require necessitates account tumor motion . SBRT technology utilize number technique accommodate tumor respiratory motion include motion-restrictive technique frame abdominal compression , well motion-compensating technique active breathe control tumor track . The motion-restrictive technique difficult patient withstand , limit patient able receive treatment . The motion-restrictive technique also necessitate use wide margin . Rusthoven et al . find gross tumor volume ( GTV ) plan target volume ( PTV ) expansion 15 mm necessary craniocaudal direction . Wide margin result irradiation substantial volume normal liver , potentially increase risk radiation-induced injury . Some study suggest motion-compensating approach active breathe control aid reduce margin require motion-restrictive approach , however , Korreman et al . suggest reduction may applicable use image-guidance within session . The CyberKnife robotic radiosurgery system ( Accuray Incorporated , Sunnyvale , CA ) advance platform deliver SBRT , provide therapeutic solution problem continuously track tumor treatment account organ motion due respiratory movement , use Synchrony respiratory track system ( Accuray Incorporated , Sunnyvale , CA ) . Utilizing continuous tumor tracking , margin expansion account motion uncertainty reduce , potential make safe effective treatment . The frameless nature CyberKnife continuous image guidance system eliminate need motion-restriction technique increase comfort availability treatment patient .</detailed_description>
