	<brief_summary>Acute liver failure rare dramatic disease , often affect young people , mark sudden loss liver function person without preexist liver disease . ALF-5755 show promote cell survival apoptotic oxidative stress , liver cell regeneration primary culture vivo . ALF-5755 may become , dramatic disease high unmet medical need , future therapy treatment patient suffer severe acute hepatitis ( SAH ) acute liver failure ( ALF ) due acetaminophen overdose , liver transplantation sole treatment absence spontaneous recovery . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy ALF-5755 versus placebo . A minimum 60 patient recruit study follow two treatment group : - Group A : approximately 30 patient receive ALF-5755 - Group B : approximately 30 patient receive placebo ( physiological saline solution : 0.9 % NaCl ) Patients receive 10 mg ( 25 ml ) ALF5755 placebo every 12 hour 3 day slow intravenous infusion 10 minute use automatic syrinx .</brief_summary>
