	<brief_summary>The main research hypothesis study , among patient Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) respond inadequately treatment SSRIs SNRIs , degree improvement , measure change baseline Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) significantly great among patient treat EB-1010 ( dose 50 mg/day 100 mg/day ) among treat placebo use sequential parallel comparison design . The secondary research hypothesis study , among patient MDD respond inadequately treatment SSRIs SNRIs , degree improvement depressive symptom , assess MGH Cognitive Physical Functioning Questionnaire ( MGH CPFQ ) significantly great among treat EB-1010 ( 50 mg/day 100 mg/day ) treat SSRI paroxetine .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must able give informed consent , ( require IRB/IEC ) , prior initiation protocol require procedure . Patients must able understand nature study , agree comply prescribed dosage regimen , report regularly schedule office visit , communicate study personnel adverse event concomitant medication use . Patients diagnosis major depressive episode define DSMIVTR criterion , base SCIDCT29 ; major depressive episode must deem `` valid '' use SAFER criterion interview24 administer remote , independent raters . Patients report history current depressive episode inadequate response 1 1 adequate SSRI SNRI treatment . An inadequate response define less 50 % reduction depressive symptom severity , assess MGH ATRQ administer remote , independent raters . An adequate trial define antidepressant treatment least 8 week duration least minimum dose specify MGH ATRQ . Patients must 17item Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAMD17 ) ( whose score derive HAMD28 ) 20 score ≥ 18 screen phase qualify inclusion . The HAMD28 administer study clinician screen baseline visit , remote , independent raters screen phase time SAFER interview . Patients must Body Mass Index ( BMI ) approximately 1840 . Patients must able reliably rat psychiatric scale require protocol base Investigator 's judgment . Patients must able understand read English . Placebo nonresponders define patient fail achieve least 50 % decrease MADRS score visit 8 ( Week 6 ) , AND MADRS score = &gt; 16 visit 8 ( Week 6 ) Men woman , age 18 65 inclusive . Meet DSMIVTR criterion ( Structured Clinical Interview DSMIVTR SCIDCT ) MDD , current . Treated one allow SSRIs SNRIs adequate dos ( define 20mg/day citalopram ; 10 mg/day escitalopram , 50mg/day sertraline ; 125 mg/day venlafaxine ; 60 mg/day duloxetine ) current episode least 8 week , , adequate dose last 4 week . Between screen baseline visit , patient must document less 25 % reduction QIDSSR score . Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy throughout study 4 week last dose investigational product manner risk pregnancy minimize . Adequate method define result low failure rate ( i.e. , less 1 % per year ) use consistently correctly implant , injectable patch hormonal contraception , oral contraceptive , IUD , doublebarrier contraception , sexual abstinence . Form birth control document screen baseline . WOCBP include female experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal ( define amenorrhea ³ 12 consecutive month ) ; woman hormone replacement therapy [ HRT ] document serum follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] level &gt; 35 mIU/mL ) . Even woman use oral contraceptive , hormonal contraceptive ( vaginal product , skin patch , implant injectable product ) , mechanical product intrauterine device barrier method ( diaphragm , condom , spermicide ) prevent pregnancy , practice abstinence partner sterile ( e.g. , vasectomy ) consider childbearing potential . WOCBP must negative urine pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) within 72 hour prior start investigational product . WOCBP unwilling unable use acceptable method avoid pregnancy entire study period [ 4 week last dose investigational product . WOCBP use prohibit contraceptive method meet establish acceptable medical standard . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Women positive pregnancy test enrollment prior investigational product administration . Sexually active fertile men use effective birth control partner WOCBP . Patients report prior inadequate response ( equal great 50 % decrease depressive symptom severity ) report inadequate response ( le 50 % decrease depressive symptom severity ) 1 prior adequate trial antidepressant treatment current depressive episode ( include monotherapy treatment distinct combination regimen ) therapeutic dose ( defined MGH ATRQ ) 2223 adequate duration ( minimum 6 week monotherapy ) . Patients report treatment adjunctive medication ( buspirone , atypical antipsychotic , lithium ) antidepressant therapy minimum 4 week current depressive episode . Patients current need involuntary commitment hospitalize within 4 week Screening Visit current major depressive episode .

More specifically , patient current Axis I diagnosis Patients experience hallucination , delusion , psychotic symptomatology current previous depressive episode . Patients meet DSMIVTR criterion significant substance use disorder within past six month , base SCIDCT . Patients receive newonset psychotherapy and/or somatic therapy ( light therapy , transcranial magnetic stimulation ) within 6 week screen , time participation trial .

Unstable medical illness include , cardiovascular , hepatic , renal , respiratory , endocrine , neurological , hematological disease . Subjects evidence history significant neurological disorder , include head trauma loss consciousness , history stroke , Parkinson 's disease , epilepsy disorder , condition low seizure threshold , seizures etiology ( include substance drug withdrawal ) , take medication control seizures , increase risk seizure evidence history EEG epileptiform activity ( exception juvenile febrile seizure ) .
