	<brief_summary>Low blood pressure hypotension important problem often see premature baby , especially low birth weight . Severe hypotension lead significant problem include brain bleeds , developmental delay , kidney liver problem , issue affect baby rest life . An important aspect management infant hypotension decision treat agent . Research conduct try find best medication use situation . Dopamine often use first , always prove effective , several concern side effect . This study look vasopressin , few side effect , first-line medication low blood pressure extremely low birth weight infant . Hypotheses Specific Aims : This study show superiority vasopressin dopamine preterm , extremely low birth weight infant hypotension within first 24 hour life . We specifically look ability raise blood pressure value , improve clinical symptom see , adverse effect , clinical outcome baby treat .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Dopamine Versus Vasopressin Treatment Low Blood Pressure Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypotension low birth weight ( LBW ) extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infant often encounter postnatal adaptation phase . Severe , prolonged hypotension contributes cellular dysfunction cell death . Systemic hypotension affect close half ELBW infant significant portion LBW infant . The true definition hypotension remain question . There linear association birth weight , gestational age , mean blood pressure blood pressure vary significantly first day life . The critical period tend first 24-36 hour life blood pressure tend rise significantly first 72 hour life regardless gestational age . Preterm infant suffer hypotension high incidence increase severity intraventricular hemorrhage ( IVH ) , periventricular leukomalacia ( PVL ) , long-term neurodevelopmental sequela compare normotensive preterm infant . Effects organ system result renal injury , hepatic injury , development necrotizing enterocolitis among complication . An important aspect management infant hypotension decision treat agent . Dopamine commonly use first-line therapy , issue efficacy side effect profile lessen favorability year . Few study compare dopamine agent first -line treatment . This study hop contribute literature information vasopressin potential first-line agent treatment neonatal hypotension low birth weight infant .</detailed_description>
