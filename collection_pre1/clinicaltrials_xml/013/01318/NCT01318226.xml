	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multiple-dose , multicenter , parallel-group study evaluate analgesic activity ATx08-001 , novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulator ( SPPARM ) , subject moderate-to-severe postherpetic neuralgia pain . Eligible subject randomize receive either placebo Atx08-001 . Study drug administer orally twice day 7 day . Subjects evaluate neuropathic pain intensity regular interval 6 hour period Day 1 follow first dose study drug . They discharge clinic complete diary assessment pain severity twice day home . Subjects ask return clinic Day 8 complete last set pain evaluation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety Analgesic Activity ATx08-001 Subjects With Postherpetic Neuralgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aestus identify novel selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor modulator ( SPPARM ) , promise potential treatment neuropathic pain . PPARs nuclear receptor control many cellular metabolic process readily modulate variety different drug . Drugs modulate target show improve blood glucose level level blood lipid , may reduce risk atherosclerosis . The primary objective study evaluate safety analgesic efficacy ATx08-001 dose 2.5 mg bid 7.5 mg bid compare placebo control moderate-to-severe postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) pain . The secondary objective : - To determine approximate time onset analgesia follow administration study drug - To determine approximate duration analgesia follow study drug administration - To determine percentage treatment responder among subject receive ATx08-001 Subjects give diary instruct record postherpetic neuralgia pain severity Numerical Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS - 12 ) `` past 12 hour '' 0 - 10 scale `` 0 '' pain `` 10 '' severe pain subject could imagine , morning night three consecutive day prior return Treatment Visit . The Treatment Visit consist in-clinic 6-hour observation period . To eligible dosing , immediately dose subject must report baseline score 4 great follow Numerical Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS-NOW ) question : `` How would rate pain RIGHT NOW use zero ten scale , zero equal pain ten bad pain imagine . '' Qualified subject administer study drug follow 6-hour observation in-clinic period . In addition Baseline pain intensity assessment conduct prior drug administration ( Time 0 ) , pain intensity score ( pain right ) assess use NPRS-NOW 30 minute , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 hour follow study drug administration . Pain relief compare Baseline assess time point use 5-point numerical pain relief ( NPR ) scale , 0 = relief , 1 = little relief , 2 = relief , 3 = lot relief , 4 = complete relief . Subjects discharge clinic end 6-hour observation period instruct record postherpetic neuralgia pain severity ( NPRS-NOW score ) pain relief ( PAR score ) 8 , 10 12 hour follow dose diary .</detailed_description>
