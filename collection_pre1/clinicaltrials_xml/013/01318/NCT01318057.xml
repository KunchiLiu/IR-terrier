	<brief_summary>Warfarin ( Coumadin ) prescribe `` blood thinner '' medication use make blood less thick people high risk form blood clot . Despite various method monitor drug , life-threatening bleeding common undesired effect might result patient death . Patients start warfarin therapy may require several week even month reach appropriate blood level warfarin . This blind practice could place patient high risk . There several demographic clinical factor significantly influence much warfarin patient need attain desire response . Genes , control hereditary trait , also important . Now , investigator know use information encode patient 's gene investigator able individualize therapy . Two gene consider involved warfarin response ( CYP2C9 VKORC1 ) . This study propose ascertain CYP2C9 VKORC1 variant present warfarin-treated Puerto Rican patient . To purpose , novel physiogenomic array comprise 384 variant 222 gene cardio-metabolic relevance use investigator able determine structure Puerto Rican population term ancestral contribution admixture may impact prevalence CYP2C9 VKORC1 variant . Secondly , investigator assess association variant clinical response order develop good method dose estimation . The expected result improvement warfarin therapy Puerto Ricans . The propose study fill gap knowledge warfarin pharmacogenetics , provide new information prevalence CYP2C9 ( metabolism ) VKORC1 ( sensitivity ) polymorphisms Puerto Ricans well role warfarin response variability observe admixed population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Warfarin frequently prescribe drug treatment prevention thromboembolic complication . Although many report publish past year different population worldwide , fundamental gap understand whether variation CYP2C9 VKORC1 gene account inter-individual variability response warfarin observe Puerto Rican patient . This study first step toward development DNA-driven personalize guideline warfarin dose optimization Puerto Rican patient thromboembolic complication . Guided strong preliminary data , application pursuit two specific aim : 1 ) Develop physiogenomic ( PG ) -driven admixture analysis 350 sample population warfarin-treated Puerto Rican patient use PG array order study pharmacogenetics warfarin Puerto Ricans 2 ) Determine whether combinatorial CYP2C9 VKORC1 genotype associate clinical phenotype warfarin therapy Puerto Rican patient . Under first aim , 350 DNA specimen warfarin-treated Puerto Rican patient consent participate study genotyped large-scale use novel Illumina-based PG-array 222 candidate gene relevant cardio-metabolic neuro-endocrine pathway order examine population structure Puerto Ricans create reference database individual admixture , allele frequency , linkage disequilibrium ( LD ) haplotypes pharmacogenetics study . Noteworthy , information remains determine Puerto Ricans . Under second aim , demographic clinically relevant non-genetic data retrospectively collect medical record patient order perform association analysis previously obtain CYP2C9 VKORC1 genotypes corresponding time achieve stable warfarin dose follow survival analysis technique Cox proportional hazard model . Accomplishment specific aim also give basis develop DNA-guided warfarin dose algorithm Puerto Rican use patient learn sample . The long-term goal generate valuable information genetic background Puerto Ricans order validate pharmacogenetic-driven warfarin dose algorithm admixed population . The propose research significant expect advance expand understand clinically relevant variant affect way people admix , under-served population respond warfarin . This important under-investigated area pharmacogenetics minority population potential applicability personalize warfarin therapy .</detailed_description>
