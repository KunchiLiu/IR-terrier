	<brief_title>Safety Study Homeo-GH ( Bone Marrow Derived Clonal Mesenchymal Stem Cell ) Treat Acute/Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease ( GVHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic MSCs use current human clinical trial nonclonal , i.e. , MSCs may type cell final stem cell product . Some concern exist heterogeneity nonclonal MSCs isolate expanded conventional density-gradient centrifugation method . Recently , develop new protocol , call subfractionation culture method ( SCM ) , generate single-cell-derived clonal MSC ( cMSC ) line whole bone marrow aspirate without employ centrifugation step mononuclear cell enzyme treatment process . This method allow u rapidly establish single-cell-derived human clonal MSC ( hcMSC ) line raw bone marrow aspirate establish library hcMSC line ( Song et al. , 2008 ) . The goal study evaluate safety allogeneic cMSCs establish SCM manufacture GMP facility . This phase I clinical trial multicenter , single dose study cMSC ( 1 x 10e6 cMSCs/Kg recipient 's bodyweight ) . Clonal MSCs infuse acute chronic GVHD patient via intravenous injection . Every patient receive treatment</detailed_description>
