	<brief_summary>Summary For ethical practical reason pre-licensure clinical efficacy phase III trial GSK Biologicals ' HPV-16/18 LI VLP AS04 vaccine use cervical intraepithelial grade 2 ( CIN2+ ) lesion surrogate efficacy endpoint cervical cancer . The long-term impact HPV vaccination cervical cancer well HPV-related non- cervical cancer , however , area warrant exploration post-licensure setting . Results multinational phase III trial demonstrate high vaccine efficacy CIN2+ associate HPV-16 and/or HPV-18 , significant vaccine efficacy CIN2+ CIN3+ irrespective HPV type lesion well evidence protection CIN2+ associate HPV type 31 45 [ Paavonen , et al . 2009 ] . Over time , vaccinate cohort benefit substantial reduction incidence cervical cancer consider impact oncogenic non-vaccine HPV type . This long-term study conduct evaluate long-term impact GSK Biologicals ' HPV-16/18 vaccine occurrence cervical pre-cancerous lesion cervical cancer follow objective : - To assess long-term efficacy HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine occurrence cervical cancer include immediate precursor ( CIN3+ ) : cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3 ( CIN3 ) adenocarcinoma situ ( AIS ) compare cohorts A C ( see ) . - To assess efficacy HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine occurrence follow potentially HPV relate non-cervical cancer vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia , vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia , anogenital neoplasia oropharyngeal neoplasia compare cohort A C ( see ) - To assess explanatory objective occurrence CIN3+ breakthrough case associate HPV-16 HPV-18 infection subject vaccinate HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine close surveillance cohort cross vaccinate cohort B ( see ) This prospective , observational cohort study undertaken originally 16-17 year-old Finnish female participate GSK Biologicals ' HPV-008 trial ( NCT00122681 ) regular clinical follow-up , divide Cohort A : Female subject Finland receive HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine HPV-008 study May 2004 May 2005 ( N=2409 ) , Cohort B : Female subject Finland receive Hepatitis A control vaccine HPV-008 study ( N=2399 ) . All subject offer HPV-16/18 L1 VLP AS04 vaccine screen cervical cancer end study ( age 21-22 ) : 50 % subject , choose take cross-over HPV vaccination HPV-008 study end . Referent Cohort C : A population-based reference cohort female subject Finland expose HPV vaccine ( either HPV vaccine trial , commercially available vaccine ; i.e . Cervarix Gardasil ) , enrol study May - September 2003 May - September 2005 , altogether 15536 subject ) . Prospective data collection start HPV screen invitation subject 2013 . Several analysis plan include analysis 8 year post-completion HPV-008 study ( 2020 ) provide total evaluation time approximately 15 year since first vaccination Cohort A . The study self-contained primary secondary endpoint . Data HPV-008 trial use address exploratory objective mention . Data collection perform use database University Tampere .</brief_summary>
