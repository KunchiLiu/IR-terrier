	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesise pre-application Qutenza® patch skin may reduce pain site Remodulin® SC infusion ( sit 1 2 week later site Qutenza pre-application ) , case would greatly improve quality life patient , enable many continue treatment . It may also provide new information support use Qutenza® patch prevent reduce pain produce inflammation . The present study explore efficacy single application Qutenza® ( capsaicin 8 % patch ) reduce site pain cause continuous SC infusion Remodulin® , pulmonary arterial hypertension patient , assess change subjective pain rating score and/or pain sensory testing .</brief_summary>
