	<brief_summary>There few therapeutic option patient active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) compare patient active Crohn 's disease ( CD ) investigator face persistent unmet need additional effective affordable therapy patient UC . Methotrexate ( MTX ) 25 mg weekly administer subcutaneously ( sq ) intramuscularly ( im ) efficient therapy induce maintain steroid free remission patient CD . To evaluate efficacy similar approach patient active ulcerative colitis investigator conduct double-blind , placebo control , randomize , multicenter , parallel group trial investigate safety efficacy 25 mg MTX apply subcutaneously weekly patient active UC , either fail 5-ASA therapy , steroid dependent intolerant respond azathioprine/6-mercaptopurine therapy response/ lose response infliximab prior study inclusion . The study design drug withdrawal trial include two period , Induction Period ( week 0-16 ) Maintenance Period ( week 17-48 ) . In open label Induction Period every patient receive steroid taper , MTX 25 mg sq weekly + daily folic acid 1 mg tablet induction clinical response remission . Patients respond open label MTX therapy steroid week 12-16 randomized week 16 1:1 Placebo sq weekly + daily folic acid 1 mg tablet + 2.4 g mesalamine MTX 25 mg sq weekly + daily folic acid 1 mg tablets+ 2.4 g mesalamine . The Specific Aims trial : ) To evaluate safety tolerability 25 mg MTX apply sq weekly time period 48 week ; ii ) To evaluate relapse-free survival MTX maintenance therapy compare placebo time period 32 week ; iii ) To evaluate efficacy MTX time period 16 week induce steroid free remission ; iiii ) To establish DNA , plasma serum library enable evaluation clinical pharmacogenomic model predict response MTX therapy patient UC . With 25-30 participate center actively enrol , investigator anticipate complete enrollment study time period 3 year . Completion trial define therapeutic value MTX UC , potentially change current therapeutic strategy UC .</brief_summary>
