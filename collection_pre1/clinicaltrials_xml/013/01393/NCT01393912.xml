	<brief_summary>This Phase I clinical trial evaluate crenolanib ( CP-868,596 ) , inhibitor Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor ( PDGFR ) -kinase child young adult newly diagnose diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma ( DIPG ) ( Stratum A ) recurrent , progressive refractory High Grade Glioma ( HGG ) include DIPG ( Stratum B ) . This study drug target commonly amplify region genome find DIPG pediatric high grade glioma ( HGG ) encode PDGF receptor kinase . An oral investigational agent crenolanib administer daily local radiation therapy ( RT ) Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma DIPG ( Stratum A ) , daily child recurrent/refractory HGG ( Stratum B ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : - To estimate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) crenolanib administer concurrently RT pediatric research participant DIPG - To estimate MTD crenolanib child young adult recurrent/refractory HGG include DIPG - To characterize pharmacokinetics crenolanib pediatric patient relate drug disposition toxicity Exploratory Secondary Objectives : - To characterize toxicity and/or adverse event associate chronic use crenolanib - To evaluate association specific polymorphisms drug metabolize enzyme pharmacokinetics crenolanib - To evaluate change phosphorylation target PDGF pathway activation peripheral blood mononuclear cell investigate possible relationship change , plasma drug level crenolanib outcome measure - To evaluate PDGFR , genotype , protein expression DNA amplification tumor tissue available - To investigate whether magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique reflect tumor pathophysiology ( metabolism , oxygenation , perfusion vessel wall integrity ) correlate clinical response - To characterize neural tract involvement tumor progression route pediatric brainstem glioma base upon anatomical magnetic resonance image diffusion tensor image - To assess pattern failure radiation therapy Stratum A participant . - To describe research participant ' parent ' perspective symptom quality life child enrol phase I trial - To describe quality life impact self-care activity parent pediatric research participant enrol phase I trial - To assess impact therapeutic alliance social support peace mind , hope , anxiety/depression quality life among parent pediatric research participant enrol phase I trial Stratum A- Appropriate dose RT administer 30-33 fraction approximately 6 week Stratum A patient . Treatment crenolanib start day RT continue daily Radiation Therapy maximum treatment duration 2 year . We plan treat maximum 5 cohort research participant ( dosage level 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) escalating dos crenolanib . A cycle define 28 day first 8 week therapy constitute dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) -evaluation period . Stratum B - Crenolanib administer orally daily basis continuously 28 day , define one cycle . The maximum treatment duration 2 year . We plan treat maximum 5 cohort research participant ( dosage level 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) escalating dos crenolanib . Dose escalation independent Stratum A escalation . The DLT evaluation period four week .</detailed_description>
