	<brief_summary>NOTE : This study recruit patient Myeloproliferative Neoplasms ( MPN ) . Dose escalation complete . The purpose study test new drug , call PU-H71 first time human , find effect , good bad , new drug patient cancer different dose level . PU-H71 block protein call Heat Shock Protein-90 ( Hsp90 ) . Hsp90 find normal cancer cell , may important cancer cell . Attacking Hsp90 stop function certain protein need cancer cell survive . The disease part study may especially sensitive attack Hsp90 , investigator see sign disease control patient MPN . This study currently enrol cohort expansion patient myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPN ) .</brief_summary>
