	<brief_summary>Background : - Sickle cell disease often cause crisis , episode pain . Many people sickle cell disease also pain crisis . Inflammation important part sickle cell pain . It may relate level nitric oxide . Nitric oxide gas body help relax blood vessel may relate pain sickle cell disease . Researchers want study relationship blood level nitric oxide pain people sickle cell disease . Researchers also want study certain gene express relate sickle cell pain . Objectives : - To collect blood sample genetic expression information study sickle cell pain relation nitric oxide level blood . Eligibility : - People least 18 year age sickle cell disease . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - This study require screen visit four study visit schedule 1 week apart . Each visit last 1 hour . - Participants screen medical history physical exam . They complete questionnaire pain level ( ) . They also provide blood sample genetic testing . - Participants breath test see much nitric oxide exhale . They also test ability detect small change temperature touch . - Participants keep diary record daily pain level pain medicine take . They write eat track food contain nitrate ( meat like ham bacon vegetable like beet spinach ) . - At four study visit , participant bring pain diary , provide blood sample , breath nitric oxide test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease systemic disorder whose proximate cause mutation beta-globin chain hemoglobin . Although characterized differ degree patterns clinical manifestation , major feature include severe episode pain . The sickle cell pain crisis one typical characteristic disease pain associate crisis report intense type clinical pain sickle cell disease display nociceptive neuropathic quality . Pain sickle cell disease widely experience poorly manage previously consider . In one community sample , 50 percent patient report experience pain half day study period . Painful crisis consist pain experience different area body , typically extremities , back , abdomen chest study suggest patient experience prodromal pre-crisis phase pain , last 24 hour develop typical feature pain crisis . The nature pain experience patient sickle cell disease well document mechanism sickle cell pain well understood . Objectives : The first objective study characterize genetic expression data sickle cell disease match control weekly time point 4 week period . The second objective measure level exhale Nitric Oxide ( eNO ) biomarkers sickle cell patient match control time point . The third objective evaluate experimental pain perception group . Population : By stratify patient pain level , study recruit sickle cell patient range symptom severity ( N=45 ) sex- , race- , ethnicity age-matched control ( N=45 ) without sickle cell trait NIH Patient Recruitment Referral Service . Design : This prospective , exploratory study steady state acute pain phase sickle cell patient . Participants undergo evaluation ( eNO blood collection ) weekly clinic visit keep pain diary 4 week first visit . All participant also undergo one session quantitative sensory test . Importance : The purpose study improve understand biochemical molecular genetic mechanism associate sickle cell pain characterize transcriptome sickle cell disease steady state pain phase . It hypothesize analysis transcriptome result panel biomarkers correlate severity level pain perhaps signal onset painful episode . The successful elucidation relationship may identify novel target intervention lead attenuation sickle cell pain , improve treatment less impact quality life functional status .</detailed_description>
