	<brief_summary>The morbidity spinal cord injury ( SCI ) increase significantly China . The method treat SCI patient sequela stage update poor . Though traditional rehabilitation therapy routine method treat SCI sequela stage , effect improve neurological disorder patient , dysfunction sense , motor , autologous adjustment blood pressure control urination defecation , perspiration , etc . unsatisfying . Rehabilitation Therapy prevent process muscle atrophy joint stiffness . However , repair damage nerve function . Studies show mesenchymal stem cell transplantation remarkably improve neurological function SCI animal without severe side effect . In study , investigator use mesenchymal stem cell derive umbilical cord treat 40 SCI patient ( 20 case early stage 20 case sequela stage ) . The investigator also follow-up ten patient receive rehabilitation another ten outpatients accept neither stem cell therapy rehabilitation . On basis , investigator compare efficacy two treatment .</brief_summary>
