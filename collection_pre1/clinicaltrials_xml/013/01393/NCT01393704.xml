	<brief_summary>The main purpose study compare blood loss time laparoscopic robotically-assisted laparoscopic myomectomy use different amount dilute vasopressin solution . Myomectomy surgical procedure remove fibroid uterus . Vasopressin synthetic drug use help decrease blood loss time gynecologic surgery ; although little know optimal dosage administration . The investigator plan perform randomized clinical trial patient schedule minimally invasive myomectomy . All patient get overall amount vasopressin . Patients assign chance one two group : one group receive high volume dilute vasopressin solution . The group receive low volume concentrate solution . The investigator collect information operative blood loss complication relate surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vasopressin Administration During Laparoscopic Myomectomy : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All surgeon enroll patient study experienced laparoscopic surgeon perform least 100 advanced laparoscopic procedure include hysterectomy myomectomies . Briefly , laparoscopic myomectomy technique follow : After gain peritoneal access place visual operative trocars , surgical site inspect carefully fibroid location identify . After inform anesthesia team vasopressin ( pharmaceutical company American Regent 20 units/ml ) inject , uterus infiltrate vasopressin . Patients randomize one two treatment group pre-operatively day surgery : 1 . One arm receive injection 200 ml total 0.05 units/ml dilute vasopressin solution ( total 10 unit Vasopressin use , dilution 20 unit vasopressin 400 ml normal saline ) . 2 . The second arm receive injection 30 ml total 0.3 units/ml dilute vasopressin solution ( total 10 unit Vasopressin use , dilution 20 unit Vasopressin 60 mL Normal Saline ) . The procedure do accord surgeon preference use various energy modality monopolar Harmonic Scalpel® ( Ethicon Endo-Surgery , Cincinnati OH ) , make incision uterus . The fibroid remove uterus examine . The incision close several layer laparoscopic standard suturing technique , hysterotomy site generally cover adhesion barrier ( Gynecare Interceed® ( Ethicon Women 's Health Urology , Somerville NJ ) Seprafilm® slurry ( Genzyme Biosurgery , Framingham MA ) ) . Blood Samples : As per routine , preoperative blood sample assess hematocrit level take great 2 week prior surgical date ; preoperative laboratory study obtain sample drawn day surgery . Postoperative blood sample assess hematocrit take sooner 4 hour surgery patient discharge day ; patient monitor overnight hospital , lab drawn postoperative day # 1 . Follow-up : Patients follow 8 week surgery ass occurrence postoperative complication . A member team ( health care worker research assistant train HIPPA procedure ) charge abstract data medical record enter information study database .</detailed_description>
