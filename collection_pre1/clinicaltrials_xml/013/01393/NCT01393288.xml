	<brief_summary>Every year , 5 million patient US experience postoperative nausea and/or vomiting ( PONV ) ambulatory set post-discharge nausea and/or vomiting ( PDNV ) common cause unanticipated hospital re-admissions . Similarly , million patient suffer chemotherapy induce nausea and/or vomiting ( CINV ) , one five patient discontinues chemotherapy reason . Thus , control nausea vomit remain major health concern investigator society . The investigatorsoverall goal understand nausea vomit optimize antiemetic selection order facilitate individualize patient care . Unfortunately , current antiemetic reduce incidence nausea one third . As result , antiemetic often combine , expose patient adverse event drug interaction without evidence effective combination . Moreover , remain unclear large amount inter-individual variability exist antiemetic responsiveness . 5HT3 , NK1 , GABA receptor target commonly prescribe anti-emetics . Furthermore , receptor many know genetic polymorphism , include several link incidence nausea vomit . Thus pharmacogenomic variation may part explain interindividual difference treatment response test proposal . Leveraging establish infrastructure UCSF Clinical Translational Science Institute , support 6 patient recruitment site , investigator enroll 1280 high risk patient three oral intervention distinct mechanisms action nausea vomit . Investigating nausea vomit ambulatory surgical patient excellent model trial owe high incidence , short observational period , ability standardize control potentially confound variable . In proposal , 100 % patient receive single intraoperative dose 4 mg ondansetron , similar 80 % patient receive prophylaxis common practice . Using factorial design , patient randomize receive one eight possible combination three intervention ( ondansetron , aprepitant , lorazepam ) versus placebo ( ond+aprep+lora , ond+aprep , ond+lora , aprep+lora , ond , aprep , lora , placebo ) . Thus , proposal 87.5 % ( 7 8 patient ) antiemetic coverage postdischarge period , considerably high common practice , 4 % patient antiemetic coverage discharge . The primary endpoint prevention nausea vomit within 48 hour ambulatory surgery . The advantage factorial trial design high efficiency systematically investigate multiple intervention allow u test potential interaction . It also ideal format simultaneous assessment pharmacogenomic interaction antiemetic proposal . To end , investigator collect DNA sample take advantage unique opportunity investigate effect variation candidate receptor gene context three treatment intervention PDNV . This approach may part explain inter-individual difference drug efficacy allow future screen at-risk patient . Specifically , investigator assess single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) copy number variant ( CNVs ) target receptor antiemetic test . Aim 1 : To determine efficacy three intervention prevention PDNV . Hypothesis 1.1 : Each intervention reduce incidence PDNV . Hypothesis 1.2 : Efficacy intervention independent efficacy combination derive efficacy individual intervention . Aim 2 : To determine drug response anti-emetics dependent upon genetic variance . Hypothesis 2 : Efficacy ondansetron , aprepitant lorazepam reduce PDNV differs 5HT3 , NK1 , GABA receptor gene variation , respectively .</brief_summary>
