	<detailed_description>Obesity important health problem modern civilization . In Western society , almost half adult population problem increase body weight . In Europe , obesity occur 10-20 % male 15-25 % female . In Poland , obesity present 20 % population . Products contain nutritional fiber use human thousand year . However , beta-glucan biologically active compound , present product , identify relatively lately . This substance polymer glucose present two form : 1,3D-1,6D 1,3D-1,4D . Water-insoluble beta-glucan ( 1,3D-1,6D ) immunomodulatory property . It stimulate host defense viral , bacterial parasitical infection bind specific receptor locate immune system cell surface many animal model . There data beta-glucan 1,3D-1,6D affect innate acquire immune response also humans . The aim study assessment influence beta-glucan 1,3D-1,6D add low-calorie diet insulin sensitivity expression select proinflammatory cytokine adipose tissue peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obese human normal glucose tolerance . The study group consist 40 subject mark overweight obesity ( body mass index , BMI &gt; 28 kg/m2 ) , without serious concomitant disease take drug affect glucose lipid metabolism , nonsmoker . Only volunteer , give write informed consent , receive full information aim design study research personnel recruit . At begin study , subject ' qualification project dietary intervention , investigator assess : - anthropometric measurement : BMI , waist-to-hip ratio ( WHR ) , full physical examination . - body composition Tanita TBF-511 Body Fat Analyzer . - glucose tolerance oral glucose tolerance test . - insulin sensitivity euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique . - clamp , additional 6 ml blood collect , PBMC isolation perform . - clamp , biopsy subcutaneous adipose tissue perform . - isolation mRNA PBMC adipose tissue perform . Then , expression select gene Real Time PCR In adipose tissue measure measure . - additionally , serum concentration ghrelin , peptide Y-Y3-36 , citruline intestinal fatty acid-binding protein assess . After initial visit , participant receive detailed instruction low-calorie diet , aim reduction 5-7 % body weight example menu 14 day . Then , participant randomly assign group receive beta-glucan preparation , addition low-calorie diet . Each group consist 20 subject . Subjects assign group receive beta-glucan , receive preparation ( BETA GLUCAN 1,3-1,6 Laboratoria Natury 500mg ) together detailed instruction usage . This preparation use non-prescription diet supplement , dose 500 mg daily indicate manufacturer . Analysis compliance dietary indication analysis body composition perform every 2 week . After 12 week low-calorie diet , without beta-glucan , examination perform begin study repeat .</detailed_description>
