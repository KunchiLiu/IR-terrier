	<brief_title>Intra-arterial Chemotherapy With Melphalan Treatment Retinoblastoma ( RTB ) Advanced Intraocular Stage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Retinoblastoma ( RTB ) frequent tumour eye early childhood commonest cancer first year life . Approximately 60 % case sporadic unilateral . Unilateral tumour usually diagnose advanced intraocular stage frequent treatment prescribe enucleation . This prevent disease progression important visual risk , also constitute mutilation , potentially devastate psychological effect patient relative . At diagnosis , patient affect RTB relative face important effect disease , threat life , although rare developed country , risk lose sight , depend uni- bilateral nature tumour , topography tumour tumour , still prevalent need enucleation treatment . In fact , almost advanced stage unilateral RTBs treat enucleation . In addition risk life patient 's sight associate treatment , also important take account risk eye . For select case advance intraocular involvement ( stage V Reese-Ellsworth classification ) enucleation would usually standard therapeutic approach , project propose alternative conservative treatment use intra-arterial chemotherapy melphalan , via direct administration catheterization ophthalmic artery . The treatment aim preserve eye ball visual acuity much possible patient , demonstrate extremely effective achieve volumetric reduction tumour , permit , necessary , subsequent conservative treatment , mainly brachytherapy anterior tumour thermotherapy laser diode posterior tumour . In case retinal detachment , significant volume reduction , achieve injection melphalan would , case , permit retinal reapplication would favour visual prognosis . This technique first describe David H. Abramson Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Memorial Hospital New York ( A Phase I/II Study direct Intra-arterial ( Ophthalmic Artery ) Chemotherapy Melphalan Intraocular Retinoblastoma ) . Here , study propose use technique first time outside New York city , clinical setting ( Retinoblastoma Unit , affiliate Oncology Development Department Ophthalmology Department Sant Joan de DÃ©u Hospital Barcelona ) . The attainment positive result , addition previously obtain New York project , could consolidate treatment alternative enucleation case advance intraocular RTB , open way future indication technique stage RTB .</detailed_description>
