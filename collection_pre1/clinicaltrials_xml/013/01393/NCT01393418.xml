	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate kidney biomarkers determine correlation Erythropoietin ( EPO ) level acute kidney injury cardiac surgery . An early biomarker kidney injury may helpful identifying , monitor manage patient risk kidney failure cardiac surgery . To evaluate Erythropoietin 's role predictor poor renal function immediate post-bypass period plan compare EPO level Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) serious complication cardiac surgery cardio-pulmonary bypass . AKI associate high mortality . Erythropoietin , hormone produce kidney , evaluate potential biomarker kidney injury . Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) study biomarker kidney injury . Early kidney injury detection long seek NGAL show promising biomarker . A troponinlike biomarker AKI easily measure capable early detection risk stratification would represent advancement ability differentiate acute kidney injury failure . Investigating EPO biomarker may prove increase predictive value clinical care cardiac surgery patient .</detailed_description>
