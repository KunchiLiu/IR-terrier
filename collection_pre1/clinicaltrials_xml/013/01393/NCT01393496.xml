	<brief_title>Effects Transfusion Thresholds Neurocognitive Outcome Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infants uniformly develop anemia prematurity frequently require multiple red blood cell transfusion ( RBCT ) neonatal intensive care . The criterion currently apply indicate RBCT population base expert opinion rather evidence conclusive data long-term effect RBCT practice exist . Both , give RBCT improve oxygen carry capacity restrict RBCT avoid RBCT associate risk cost potentially impair long-term development . The propose blind randomize control trial design power compare effect restrictive versus liberal red blood cell transfusion guideline long-term neurodevelopmental outcome ELBW infant . ELBW infant randomize receive RBCT accord liberal restrictive RBCT guideline , reflect current practice Germany aim clinically relevant difference mean hemoglobin concentration . The primary outcome measure incidence death major neurodevelopmental impairment determine 24 month age correct prematurity . Key secondary outcome incidence individual component composite primary outcome , mental physical developmental index score Bayley Scales Infant Development ( II edition ) , growth . Safety analyse assess incidence major disease prematurity . The result trial may help improve quality life patient reduce long-term health care cost .</detailed_description>
