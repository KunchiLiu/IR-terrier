	<brief_summary>This pilot study double-blinded , randomize control , two-centre trial subject receive 4 8 ( subcutaneous administer ) dose medication ( Omalizumab placebo ) ( dose dose interval calculate body weight baseline total serum IgE ) . During treatment period follow-up , clinical efficacy treatment assessed evaluation symptom , Quality Life questionnaire , morning Peak Expiratory Flow measurement , smell test , nasal endoscopy , CT-scan , peak nasal inspiratory flow spirometry . Biological activity evaluate measure peripheral local ( serum , nasal secretion , biopsy ) marker inflammation . Study hypothesis 1 . Evaluation efficacy safety anti-IgE ( Omalizumab ) patient nasal polyposis comorbid asthma . 2 . Exploration anti-IgE effect local systemic metabolism IgE nasal polyposis 3 . Clinical assessment IgE theory pathogenesis nasal polyp</brief_summary>
