	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure effect ranolazine ETT ( exercise treadmill test ) exercise duration four ethnic subgroup establish coronary artery disease risk factor ( ) metabolic syndrome : Caucasian , African American , Southeast Asian East Indian .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ranolazine , Ethnicity Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies show various ethnic subgroup differential risk development progression coronary artery disease . The East Indian population one high risk population coronary artery disease . Much increase risk driven development progression diabetes . Recent study show ranolazine favorable effect glycemic control . In addition , effective antianginal antiarrhythmic agent . The investigator propose pilot study look safety , tolerability efficacy agent patient establish coronary artery disease ( CAD ) risk factor metabolic syndrome various ethnic background . In particular investigator focus Caucasian , African American , Southeast Asian East Indian population .</detailed_description>
