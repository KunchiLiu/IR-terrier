	<brief_summary>Today , evident vitamin D ( VD ) widespread effect classical action relate bone mineralization calcium homeostasis1 . VD deficiency result impaired reproductive performance various specie animal , recently investigator show VD receptor ( VDR ) , activate ( CYP2R1 , CYP27A1 , CYP27B1 ) inactivating ( CYP24A1 ) enzymes expressed human testis , epididymis , seminal vesicle , prostate spermatozoon . Our follow functional study show VD increase intracellular calcium mature spermatozoon , hence may important spermatogenesis also sperm maturation . A new , yet unpublished cross sectional study 300 young healthy Danish men show men low level serum VD significantly low number normally develop motile spermatozoon . Hitherto , case male infertility classify `` idiopathic '' , infertile couple refer symptomatic treatment infertility clinic . These fertility treatment often physically demand female partner well expensive health care system . Any treatment might improve semen quality involuntary infertile men would beneficial infertile couple society general . Our finding VD may play role human semen quality yet test clinically . However , VD supplementation prove efficient open first time causal , safe cheap treatment least case `` idiopathic '' impaired semen quality . The investigator believe new human data support result VD deficient VDR KO animal study high proportion VD deficient Danish men provide sufficient evidence initiate randomize clinical trial VD supplementation infertile men . Infertile men also unfavorable altered level sex hormones high mortality fertile men . Since VD deficiency associate increased mortality , regulation aromatase , immune system , bone metabolism , glucose metabolism , cardiovascular system etc . suggest clinical trial may also able evaluate several secondary endpoint addition potential effect semen quality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vitamin D Supplementation Male Infertility : The CBG-study Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background In 2008 , approximately 8 % newborn child conceive assisted reproduction . Intracytoplasmatic sperm injection ( ICSI ) account ~50 % treatment mainly use case severely reduced semen quality . This many case likely cause prenatal factor adversely affect develop testicle , therefore unlikely treatment adult men able completely normalize semen quality . However , less would also clinically relevant . If reduce semen quality could improve prior assist reproduction less invasive treatment would need . Eg . classical vitro fertilization ( IVF ) rather ICSI , simple intrauterine insemination ( IUI ) rather IVF natural conception rather IUI . Several endocrine factor implicate sperm production maturation , little known potential role VD . VD key regulator calcium homeostasis bone mineralization , although expression vitamin D receptor ( VDR ) various tissue relate several diverse action . VD affect reproduction several animal specie , convincingly show rodent , VD deficiency male rat result reduced sperm count , female rat inseminate semen VD deficient male rat low fertility rate . The impaired reproductive performance reversible correct either supply VD normalize calcium level . Supported VDR knockout mouse , show decreased sperm count , reduce sperm motility histological abnormality testis , unlike VD deficient male rat partly restore calcium supplement . The investigator recently show expression VDR VD metabolize enzymes human testis , ejaculatory tract mature spermatozoon . The investigator subsequently show VD physiological concentration increase intracellular calcium spermatozoon . VD act rapid non-genomic response VD induce increase calcium may crucial spermatozoon , VD induce sperm motility acrosome reaction . Expression analysis spermatozoon fertile infertile men show men impaired semen quality few metabolize VD normal men ( p &lt; 0.0005 ) make presence one proteins potential marker semen quality . Furthermore , investigator complete cross sectional study 300 young men general population find low serum VD associate reduced sperm motility morphology . SETTING , SCIENTIFIC PLAN AND RECRUITMENT Participants include among men refer Department Growth Reproduction ( dept . GR ) , Rigshospitalet ( RH ) evaluation male infertility DESIGN This prospective , double blind , two-arm randomize controlled trial Group intervention : Each man receive 300,000 IU ( 7500 ug ) cholecalciferol ( D3 ) orally blood- semen sample perform DXA scan . Thereafter receive VD tablet 1,400 IU ( 35 ug ) + 500 mg calcium daily 3 month . Telephone control 4 week 3 month clinical control blood sampling perform , follow continued daily intake 1400 IU VD + 500 mg calcium 2 additional month . At end treatment five month inclusion men deliver two semen sample , blood sample drawn DXA scan perform . Group receive placebo : Will follow chain event , although VD replace placebo . PARTICIPANTS Screening ~700-800 infertile men perform . The investigator assume ~340 men exclude ~100 men wish participate . Thus , 300 men include study half randomize active VD treatment . The investigator expect small drop ( &lt; 20 ) high motivation adverse effect . ANALYSIS AND INTERVENTION Reproductive hormone growth factor analyze dept . GR , Rigshospitalet . An aliquot first blood sample analyzed inclusion study another keep analyzed time second blood sample end trial overcome interassay variation . Other serum analysis analyze department clinical biochemistry , Rigshospitalet . Semen analyse DXA scan perform dept . GR . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION AND STATISTICS In association study 300 participant investigator able detect significant dose response relationship VD status sperm motility morphology , find significant difference men low high VD level . Based result , investigator assume able increase serum level VD 50 nM setup . Including 150 men group enable u detect change sperm motility morphology 15 % 25 % change Inhibin B level . Intention treat principle use co-variate analyzes use analyze potential effect VD . BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS All analyse perform accord Good Clinical Practice guideline primary analysis intention-to-treat population , include patient underwent randomization receive first dose medicine day 1 . We analyze data 3 way . The primary analysis proceed accord randomize vitamin D calcium dose group assignment . The secondary analysis base stratify men accord subgroup analyse relation predefined primary secondary endpoint , last analysis try elucidate dose-response relationship . An author ( JHP ) statistician study unaware study-group assignment perform primary analysis . Data analysis quality The primary end point protocol change semen quality especially sperm motility follow sperm concentration , morphology semen volume . Multiple secondary endpoint exist initial investigation focus change follow secondary endpoint : Sperm DFI , pregnancy rate , Inhibin B , vitamin D calcium homeostasis . Subjects terminate participation visit 90 day visit day 150 include data analysis day 90 . Men deliver one semen sample miss data visit still include analysis . Men fever 3 month prior semen analysis consider potential confounder . Men meet criterion protocol exclude analysis . Those value carry forward analysis . A significance level 5 % use . For primary analysis Bonferronu-Holm p-value correction calculate additionally . For secondary analysis multiple test correction use . Instead result discuss view multiple testing situation . 1 . Analyses placebo versus active substance Between group analyse placebo versus vitamin D + calcium : The first step compare change primary outcome across two group placebo versus vitamin D + calcium . This analysis show significant difference group . For outcomes measure repeatedly , entail comparing estimate slope , rate change , outcome group . Mixed model allow correlation repeat observation baseline-day 1-day 90- day 150 man suitably incorporate parameter estimation . For endpoint measured baseline day 150 , pair t-tests used ass significant difference group determine whether mean change within group differs significantly zero . In case , data transform necessary meet model assumption . Afterwards , analysis conduct use multiple regression relevant confounders season , BMI , smoking , duration abstinence , time ejaculation motility assessment , fever etc . see change result For outcomes measure compare t-test parametric test day 1 , day 90 day 150 , group compare use non-parametric test Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney test . For Binary outcome data compare two group mean conditional logistic-regression analysis adjustment relevant confounders ( define significantly p &lt; 0.05 associate ) . 2 . Analyses stratification subgroup Subjects group accord BMI , calcium , season , semen quality , bonefactors , BMD vitamin D level effect placebo versus active substance evaluate day 90 day 150 . The subgroup analyse accordance normal clinical practice stratification appropriate group accord clinical ( 25OHD &lt; 25 nmol/l , BMI &lt; 25 , 25-30 , &gt; 30 etc . ) , tertiles/quartiles/quintiles highest/lowest versus remain baseline . 3 . Data analysis comparison change vitamin D calcium We also compare dose-response relationship change vitamin D calcium primary secondary endpoint placebo active substance group men . We determine delta value circulate vitamin D progenitor , calcium ion , total calcium albumin correct calcium start 90 day 150 day compare difference observe change primary secondary endpoint . We anticipate difference shape dose-response curve different endpoint i.e . parallel linear least transformation data . Afterwards , analysis conduct use relevant confounders season , BMI , smoking , duration abstinence , time ejaculation motility assessment etc . see change result . SCREENING AND TIME COURSE Men , investigate dept . GR due infertility screen eligibility study , meet criterion participation inform , consent allocate active treatment VD placebo . Allocation do minimization use minim avoid unbalanced grouping due randomization failure . Following variable balance : Sperm concentration , BMI , serum inhibin-B , VD level . ETHICS AND SIDE EFFECTS All patient fulfil investigation , invite study . They inform potential adverse effect , sign intoxication leave trial point without consequence . The trial run accordance `` good clinical practice '' . VD treatment give virtually side effect risk intoxication almost nonexisting suggested setting , relatively low dos VD close monitor VD calcium status . The participant expose oral VC/placebo , 2 DXA scan , 3 extra blood sample draw deliver 2 extra semen sample . All participant inform counsel accord VD status . PUBLICATION OF RESULTS All result , positive negative submit peer review scientific journal . Data successively obtain transferred statistical database . PRACTICAL ISSUES Dept . GR investigate annually 500 infertile men . Participants include group . The department clinical expertise , experience capacity perform investigation , except measurement blood sample , analyze department clinical biochemistry .
