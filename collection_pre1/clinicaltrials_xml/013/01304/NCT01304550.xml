	<brief_title>Evaluation Accuracy Masimo Pulse-Hemoglobin-Meter Monitor Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The chief objective study internally validate accuracy Masimo SpHb ( TM ) technology compare laboratory measurement Hb . We use Masimo SpHb monitor patient underwent open heart surgery , hepatic resection , kidney transplant aortic aneurysm repair since January 2009 . These patient also hemoglobin concentration measurement part arterial blood gas analysis perform laboratory evaluate intraoperative ventilation electrolyte change . We collate laboratory measurement Masimo SpHb value document anesthetic record .</detailed_description>
