	<brief_summary>Osteosarcoma common malignant bone tumor child adolescent . Because cure rate osteosarcoma remain stagnant past several decade despite numerous trial chemotherapy agent , novel therapy base understanding molecular pathogenesis osteosarcoma need . Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome ( RTS ) genetic disorder affect many part body result major skeletal abnormality . This disease also propensity increase risk develop cancer , particularly osteosarcoma . Two-thirds RTS patient high risk develop osteosarcoma . Therefore , important understand impact RTS skeletal phenotype ( measured calcium absorption bone mineralization ) order develop effective therapy battle osteosarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This laboratory experiment evaluate bone calcium deposition patient Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome ( RTS ) . This study include one study visit subject admit inpatient unit Pediatric GCRC TCH undergo comprehensive clinical evaluation team physician familiar RTS well bone-specific study divide four part . Procedures study may combine procedure H-9106 , another protocol patient RTS Dr. Wang . Subjects arrive GCRC TCH overnight fast . Per TCH pain management protocol , numb cream spray offer subject prior blood draw . Tylenol per TCH pain protocol allow . All food beverage consume GCRC pre-arranged study dietitian weigh GCRC nutrition staff . Additional food allow unless approve study dietitian . Subjects ask provide 3-day write dietary history well food preference GCRC study day . For first meal study day , subject consume 180 mL low-fat milk orange juice 20 microgram 46Ca add . ( If milk use vehicle isotope , 46Ca add 18-24 hour advance . ) Immediately breakfast , subject receive 5 mg 42Ca intravenously 2-3 minute . The begin infusion serve Time 0 . After infusion complete , catheter hub change preparation subsequent blood draw . Samples calcium isotope ratio measurement ( 0.5 ml whole blood ) obtain 6 , 12 , 20 , 40 , 120 , 180 , 240 , 480 minute infusion . GCRC provide weigh diet study day direct study dietitian . Each meal contain approximately 300 mg calcium snack provide negligible calcium . A complete 24-hour urine collection 8 hour aliquot perform GCRC start first void isotope give . After completion 24 hour period , subject discharge . They continue collect urine 8 hour aliquot additional 24 hour collect three spot urine sample day next 6 day . These sample mail CNRC research laboratory Dr. Steven Abrams analyze isotope ratio mass spectrometry analysis . Upon discharge , subject receive food scale instruction sheet record dietary intake next 3 day ( i.e. , weigh food record ) . While inpatient , study dietitian instruct family guideline record intake . After 3 day , food scale record return CNRC analysis .</detailed_description>
