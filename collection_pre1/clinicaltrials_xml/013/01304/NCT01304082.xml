	<brief_summary>When one receive local anesthetic , novocaine dental procedure , burn painful sensation experience upon injection local anesthetic . We try understand role pH ( acidic solution ) production pain local anesthetic administration . We hypothesize less acidic solution produce less burn . We also want determine whether pH solution affect rate onset local anesthesia . We recruit subject patient clinical indication lumbar medial branch ( LMB ) nerve block , procedure frequently perform Massachusetts General Hospital Center Pain Medicine . For patient , three nerve block administer adjacent spinal level , typically use either lidocaine bicarbonate-buffered lidocaine local anesthetic . We add saline control part research procedure provide lidocaine control location continue nerve block . This clinical procedure offer ideal opportunity compare effect three solution . There almost deviation standard clinical procedure . After injection solution , pain score administration medication record immediately . We also provide continuous stimulation ( pin tap ) local anesthetic injection record patient experience hypoesthesia ( reduced sensation ) anesthesia ( absent sensation ) . Finally , record pain score upon reinsertion needle mark precise location ( part clinical procedure ) one minute local anesthetic injection . All data collect single clinical visit . The study conclude 60 subject successfully test . Data review annually .</brief_summary>
