	<detailed_description>In Israel approximately 16,000 new case stroke per year recently stroke recognize Israeli health-care policy planner top priority disease . Individuals sustain stroke constitute large population significant need rehabilitation . The common symptom follow stroke paresis paralysis half body , contralateral side brain lesion . These individual experience difficulty perform basic activity daily life ( BADL ) dress walking , addition instrumental activity daily life ( IADL ) shopping cooking . Physical activity strongly recommend individual maintain functional level achieve rehabilitation . In addition regular physical activity prevent secondary condition heart disease , diabetes , obesity decrease risk recurrent stroke . Reduced physical activity also lead disuse atrophy cardiovascular de-conditioning , result deterioration person 's physical condition . However , recent finding suggest people stroke perform enough physical activity upper low extremity . The use Virtual Reality ( VR ) rehabilitation find potential encouraging active purposeful movement . Many researcher assess feasibility &amp; usability different VR system environments individual stroke . Costly VR system addition off-the-shelf video game console ( e.g . Sony PlayStation EyeToy , Nintendo Wii ) find great potential encourage active purposeful movement . However , date , limited number study investigate effectiveness VR therapy post-stroke . Since physical activity recognize main factor facilitate recovery post stroke important factor prevent recurrent stroke due fact individual stroke participate sufficiently physical activity . Their physical functional ability may deteriorate lead expensive hospitalization devastate outcome , therefore , I suggest carry study . STUDY OBJECTIVES : The overall aim study ass effectiveness use novel technology VR therapy promote participation daily physical activity individual stroke . A 'Community base ' VR program compare traditional therapy program promote daily physical activity lower upper extremity . METHODS : A Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) compare VR therapy traditional therapy apply . Eligible participant randomly allocate experimental control group . Blind assessor assess ability pre post 3-month intervention 3-month follow-up . Novel instrumentation VR system video-game console apply intervention experimental group accelerometer ( measure intensity duration movement ) utilize assess 'free-living ' daily physical activity upper low extremity group . In addition clinical assessment administer assess motor functional ability individual . The main hypothesis : 1 . Daily walk post intervention increase significantly VR therapy group compare traditional therapy group . 2 . Daily use weak upper extremity post intervention increase significantly VR therapy group compare traditional therapy group . 3 . Daily walk follow-up significantly high VR therapy group compare traditional therapy group . 4 . Daily use weak upper extremity follow-up increase significantly VR therapy group compare traditional therapy group . Secondary hypothesis ; 1 . Post intervention follow-up , motor functional ability weak upper extremity individual VR therapy group improve significantly compare motor functional ability weak upper extremity individual traditional therapy group . 2 . Post intervention follow-up , motor functional ability weak low extremity balance individual VR therapy group improve significantly compare individual traditional therapy group . 3 . Participation ADL post intervention follow-up significantly high VR therapy group compare traditional therapy group . 4 . The executive function individual post intervention follow-up significantly high VR therapy group compare traditional therapy group .</detailed_description>
