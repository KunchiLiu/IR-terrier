	<detailed_description>Fabry disease due alteration genetic material ( DNA ) cause deficiency alpha-galactosidase A enzyme . This enzyme aid breakdown elimination certain type fatty substance call glycolipids . These glycolipids normally present within body cell . When alpha-galactosidase A lacking , glycolipids build various tissue eye , liver , kidney , skin , muscle , heart , blood vessel . The build glycolipid level tissue , particularly globotriaosylceramide ( GL-3 ) , think cause clinical symptom associate Fabry disease . Fabry disease cause chronic kidney damage lead need dialysis kidney transplantation , chronic heart damage lead abnormal heart rhythms heart attack stroke early age , nervous system damage lead chronic pain , premature death . Because gene Fabry X chromosome ( men one X chromosome woman two ) , patient symptoms Fabry men many woman symptom may severe men . There currently FDA approve treatment available treat many symptom Fabry , involve intravenous infusion every week expensive . When start child therapy controversial expense inconvenience . Children significant pain gastrointestinal problem start therapy immediately , otherwise least teenager . Increasing evidence suggest even without overt symptom , significant , irreversible damage may occur childhood . However , determine whether damage present require biopsy . There simple measure disease severity . Many Fabry child complain exercise intolerance . In adult , investigator find decreased lung function ability exercise treadmill . Whether lung function exercise capacity abnormal child unknown . While lung function exercise test commonly part routine evaluation adult Fabry , yet child . The objective propose study accurately define lung exercise abnormality group 20 boys 8-18 year age Fabry disease treat enzyme replacement therapy ( Fabrazyme ) . This do several breathing test exercise treadmill . If breathing test abnormal , test would serve easy way evaluate child help decide therapy start monitor effectiveness therapy . Each person consent participate study require commit single study visit last approximately 4 hour Cedars-Sinai Medical Center . The participant expect wear loose fit clothing comfortable athletic footwear . As part research , participant ask participate following test : 1 . A pulmonary function test 2 . Exercise test . Results forward participant 's primary care physician . All subject must previously enrol Fabry Registry recommend standard care assessment order eligible pilot study .</detailed_description>
