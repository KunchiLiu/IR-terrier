	<detailed_description>This study base hypothesis disruption brain-gut axis irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) consequence increase degradation tryptophan along kynurenine pathway . The investigator aim fully characterize putative metabolic abnormality determine impact gastrointestinal ( GI ) central nervous system ( CNS ) signal examine relationship individual pathway metabolite , GI symptom cognitive processing IBS patient An increase degradation tryptophan along kynurenine pathway report depression IBS ( Clarke et al 2009a ; Fitzgerald et al 2008 ; Myint et al 2007 ) . Although study suggest alteration production quinolinic acid consequence disruption , actual level NMDA receptor agonist remain measured essential full characterization pathway disruption . The relevance strategy confirm study implicate peripheral quinolinic acid measure surrogate marker disease activity juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathy ( Rider et al 2002 ) . Moreover demonstrate increase plasma level neurotoxic metabolite influence CNS process ( Yan et al 2005 ) increase peripheral production kynurenine increase central quinolinic acid concentration ( Raison et al 2009a ) . A correlation alteration kynurenine pathway , GI disturbances cognitive outcome remain fully define . In study , investigator propose obtain complete profile plasma kynurenine pathway metabolite IBS patient without comorbid depression . Temporal instability symptom profile hallmark IBS represent considerable obstacle biomarker discovery ( Clarke et al 2009b ) . The preliminary data generate potentially used basis future grant application propose longitudinal study putative biomarker candidate . BACKGROUND/SIGNIFICANCE Irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) functional gastrointestinal disorder account 20 % case present gastroenterologist clinic western world unexplained female predominance ( Ersryd et al 2007 ) . Although typical symptom commonly experience general population , abdominal pain disturbance defecatory function experience IBS sufferer scale position disorder one leading cause work absenteeism presenteeism western society . Clearly burden place individual sufferer society whole substantial compound drain healthcare resource ( Clarke et al 2009b ) . Despite widespread prevalence disorder still poorly understood largely characterized lack reliable validated biological marker . This reflect reliance symptom base diagnostic criterion conjunction exclusion gastrointestinal disorder ( Drossman 2006 ) . Further complication arise form psychiatric comorbidity frequently observe among IBS population ( Spiller 2004 ) . It perhaps unsurprising treatment option inadequate advance understand disorder urgently require address unmet medical need sufferer . Tryptophan essential amino acid role precursor many biologically active agent ensure importance consideration variety disease state include schizophrenia ( Barry et al 2009 ; Schwarcz Pellicciari 2002 ) , depression ( Myint et al 2007 ) inflammatory bowel disease ( Forrest et al 2003 ) . Although much attention date focus production serotonin tryptophan , often-overlooked kynurenine metabolic pathway ( Appendix figure 1 ) consume 95 % available peripheral tryptophan mammal ( Clarke et al 2009a ) . The first step cascade involve conversion tryptophan kynurenine report suggest majority CNS concentration metabolite draw periphery ( Myint et al 2007 ) . This important consideration validates use plasma tryptophan metabolites biomarker study . This first rate limit step metabolic cascade catalyse either ubiquitous indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase ( IDO ) largely hepatic base tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase ( TDO ) . Crucially context stress related disorder like IBS depression , activity enzyme induce agent stress responsive-IDO inflammatory mediator TDO corticosteroid ( Ruddick et al 2006 ) . Once form , kynurenine essentially participate two important alternate metabolic scenarios-one lead formation neuroprotective kynurenic acid lead production neurotoxic quinolinic acid ( Ruddick et al 2006 ) . The neuroprotective effect kynurenic acid attribute competitive blockade NMDA receptor glycine co-agonist site . Conversely quinolinic acid excititoxic property due potent activation NR2A NR2B NMDA receptor subunit ( Schwarcz Pellicciari 2002 ) . Clearly imbalance production bioactive ligand could lead profound disturbance CNS glutamatergic signal thus affect glutamate-driven behaviour learn memory . Recent progress study IBS largely bring theoretical view condition disorder brain-gut axis ( Ohman Simren 2007 ) . Within construct , stressful insult think integral destabilization normal brain-gut axis signal . Higher brain centre involve process afferent GI signal communication change individual emotional state gastrointestinal tract ( Mayer 2000a ; Mayer 2000b ) . The emotional motor system , consist limbic system paralimbic structure medial prefrontal cortex , amygdala hypothalamus , one centre . The importance structure maintenance normal cognitive function implies brain-gut axis perturbation could manifest cognitive impairment across number domain . Other line evidence also support alter neuropsychological state IBS . An emerge body research point presence low grade inflammation disorder ( Barbara Stanghellini 2009 ; Clarke et al 2009b ) . It recently report baseline interleukin-6 level , cytokine consistently report elevated IBS ( Clarke et al 2009b ) , predictive cognitive symptom depression follow longitudinal study ( Gimeno et al 2009 ) . It also demonstrate patient chronic fatigue syndrome , disorder also link increased inflammatory mediator ( Raison et al 2009b ) , associate cognitive deficit ( Thomas Smith 2009 ) . Previous study laboratory highlight relationship inflammatory profile IBS increase degradation tryptophan along kynurenine pathway ( Clarke et al 2009a ; Fitzgerald et al 2008 ) . Moreover , cancer patient treat cytokine immunotherapy experience relate persistent cognitive alteration ( Capuron et al 2001 ) cognitive alteration accompany infection also present apyretic sick subject ( Capuron et al 1999 ) . The increase tryptophan degradation observe follow immunotherapy consider key mediator result neuropsychological alteration ( Capuron et al 2002 ; Raison et al 2009a ) . Cumulatively , study suggest IBS disorder possess molecular signature ( increase , inflammation disturb tryptophan metabolism ) indicative cognitive deficit . However , despite uncover molecular signature IBS , widespread acceptance brain-gut axis model high psychiatric comorbidity , comprehensive cognitive profile IBS patient population perform . The cognitive assessment report support cognitive phenotype disorder date focus singular aspect affective memory performance ( Kilkens et al 2005 ; Kilkens et al 2004 ) verbal IQ deficit ( Dancey et al 2009 ) . Moreover , , knowledge study correlate cognitive function mechanistically-oriented biomarkers . Before benefit correlation accrue however , complete assessment cognitive dysfunction IBS urgently require . The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery ( CANTAB ) computerize cognitive assessment program cover within remit broad section cognitive domain ( Fray Robbins 1996 ) . The battery validate assessment cognitive dysfunction across wide range disease state include psychiatric disorder anxiety ( Kaplan et al 2006 ) unipolar bipolar mood disorder ( Elliott et al 1996 ; Sweeney et al 2000 ) . Insights gain neuroimaging study IBS highlight high brain centre function abnormally syndrome ( Mayer et al. , 2008 ) use inform initial choice test apply IBS subject . Investigations disorder report inflammatory component chronic fatigue disorder assessment free recall , reaction time vigilance conjunction Stroop colour-word interference task measure distraction irrelevant stimulus yield interesting result ( Thomas Smith 2009 ) . The specific executive function assessment apply include Stocking Cambridge Task ( SOC ) assess subject 's ability rearrange set ball specify minimum number move minimum time intradimensional/extradimensional ( ID/ED ) attentional set shift task ( adapt Wisconcin Card Sorting Test ( WCST ) ) use assess subject ability maintain attention . CANTAB visual memory task spatial recognition memory task ( SRM ) pair associate learn task ( PAL ) use assess deficit memory ( Michopoulos et al 2008 ) . Taken together , test sensitive dysfunction across number different brain region ( Sweeney et al 2000 ) . Recently cognitive assessment available CANTAB battery use conjunction measure clinical insight ass association poor insight cognitive impairment schizophrenia ( Donohoe et al 2009 ) . This may also relevant IBS increase awareness concern bodily sensation GI function well establish ( Posserud et al 2009 ) . It also important rule alternative explanation alteration observe included task irrelevant thought related disease . Few attempt make link finding GI symptom putative biological marker candidate .</detailed_description>
