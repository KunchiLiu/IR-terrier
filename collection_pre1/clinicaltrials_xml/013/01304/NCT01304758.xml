	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety initial effectiveness MRI-guided focus ultrasound thermal ablation designate area brain patient suffer medication-refractory Essential Tremor , use ExAblate transcranial system . The ExAblate system medical device involves focus ultrasound system MRI scanner . ExAblate delivers pulse focus ultrasound energy , sonication , target tissue . In particular study target tissue unilateral thermal lesion create ventralis intermedius nucleus thalamus . The treatment begin series standard diagnostic MR image identify location shape tumor treat . The ExAblate computer use physician 's designation target volume plan best way cover target volume small spot call `` sonications '' . These treatment spot cylinder shape . Their size depend sonication power duration . During treatment , specific MR scan , process identify change tissue temperature , provide thermal map treatment volume confirm therapeutic effect . The thermal map use monitor treatment progress , confirm ablation proceed accord plan , thus close therapy loop . The ExAblate transcranial operate helmet-shaped transducer ( currently utilize 1000-element phased array transducer ) position subject head . The ExAblate transcranial system also include mean immobilize subject head , cool interface water , software CT analysis phase correction computation . The ExAblate transcranial system experimental device investigate study .</brief_summary>
