	<brief_summary>Respiratory muscle seem activate differently critically ill patient healthy person . Needle electrode would provide artefact-free signal information muscle activation . However , needle recording invasive technique limit feasibility clinical setting . Intention study investigate surface electromyography could use measure recruitment pattern ventilatory muscle .</brief_summary>
