	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacokinetics Kovacaine Nasal Spray</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine safety pharmacokinetics standard dose intranasal Kovacaine Mist 0.6 mL ( 18 mg tetracaine HCl 0.3 mg oxymetazoline HCl ) propose maximum recommend dental dose 1.2 mL ( 36 mg tetracaine HCl 0.6 mg oxymetazoline HCl ) . The primary objective determine either dose significantly change blood pressure reading ( systolic diastolic ) , pulse rate , oxygen saturation level baseline pretreatment value determine safety profile dos . The secondary objective establish pharmacokinetics oxymetazoline , tetracaine , major metabolite ( parabutylaminobenzoic acid ) follow intranasal administration dos . Each subject receive standard dose ( 3 spray nostril 4 minute pair spray ) follow 1 3 week later high dose ( 6 spray nostril ) .</detailed_description>
