	<brief_summary>Alpha-1 Antitrypsin ( AAT ) , trade name ( Glassia ® ) , explore phase I/II trial potential disease modify agent Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) base anti-inflammatory property . AAT acute stress reactant protein increase inflammation . In T1DM inflammation serve major role disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Safety Efficacy Intravenous Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AAT protein produce human liver secrete blood circulation . AAT , belong group serine protease inhibitor ( SERPINS ) acute stress reactant protein increase stress condition , include inflammation . AAT block serine protease enhance pro-inflammatory mediator ( i.e . IL-1 alpha , IL-6 , IL-8 , TNFalpha ) well induce production anti-inflammatory mediator ( i.e . IL-10 IL-1-receptor antagonist ) . In Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) inflammation serve major role disease progression . The inflammatory signature pattern patient appear present year clinical onset . Although circulating level AAT T1DM normal , majority case , activity AAT severely compromise non-enzymatic glycations , support conclusion serum protease inhibitory capacity reduce T1DM . It show different study , include vivo vitro AAT protective affect pancreatic islet . This demonstrated decrease progression diabetes non-obese diabetic ( NOD ) mouse well transplantation islet present viability activity ( insulin production ) presence AAT . More specifically , islet cell protect human AAT apoptosis , show reduced caspase-3 activity addition human AAT islet culture medium . Based mention anti-inflammatory property AAT side vivo vitro study indicate AAT may serve disease modify agent T1DM , present study suggest .</detailed_description>
