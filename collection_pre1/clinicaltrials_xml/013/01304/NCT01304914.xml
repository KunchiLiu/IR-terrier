	<detailed_description>This prospective , community-based longitudinal birth cohort study respiratory gastrointestinal pathogen detection Brisbane infant . The enrollment target 138 child take 2 year achieve , child follow second birthday , final year require specimen data analysis ; total duration study 5 year . Women recruit antenatally period two year study commencement ( mid-2010 ) . These hospital serve community north Brisbane , city almost 2 million people , every year roughly 5,200 ( RBWH ) 1,700 ( North West ) annual delivery respectively . The investigator follow 138 infant birth second birthday . Where family drop study lose follow-up , replace maintain overall person-time study . The progressive 2 year recruitment plan allow seasonal year-to-year variation respiratory virus activity . Eligible infant healthy term baby without condition predispose frequent severe infectious episode . Parents keep simple , daily , infection symptom diary , complete use tick box number , investigator request return 4-weekly basis . A similar diary use 12-month cohort study conduct Melbourne ( 2003-2004 ) excellent return rate acceptability study family . Study family contact monthly prefer method communication ( telephone , SMS , email ) encourage continue performance study task answer study related question . Parents ask identify acute respiratory illness ( ARI ) acute gastroenteritis ( AGE ) study child . These define : - ARI : presence least one yellow OR least two blue symptom single day ; - AGE : three watery looser-than-normal stool OR vomit single day . When ARI AGE occur , parent ask complete impact diary duration illness . Parents ask contact u event hospitalisation due cause . Parents ask provide consent hospital/GP release information allow study staff collect detail episode care . Cord blood also collect birth store later identification pathogen-specific antibody immune mediator link disease susceptibility . A respiratory stool swab collect study neonate within one day birth . At visit , investigator collect respiratory swab parent/s child - allow u compare presence pathogen neonate parent , time parent swab . Parents train process collect study swabs visit . All material instruction require process provide parent cost . Telephone visit support assist guide specimen collection available study parent stage study . Parents ask routinely collect two specimen day week initial visit , weekly end study . The specimen : - combine anterior naris swab , collect nostril use single , rayon-budded swab . The swab come transport tube contain VTM-soaked sponge base . The complete swab place transport tube VTM sponge squeeze bath swab ; - stool swab dirty nappy , collect handle use swab similar anterior naris swab . Both swab mail back Qpid Laboratory soon possible collection , use pre-addressed , reply post , pad envelope . All specimen batch test variety pathogen use validated PCR method develop Qpid . Samples child ARI AGE know agent identify , make available investigation presence yet unidentified virus .</detailed_description>
