	<brief_title>This Study Designed Evaluate PD/PK Safety Replagal Manufactured Two Different Processes .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2008 , change agalsidase alfa drug substance manufacturing process make . There change drug product formulation , manufacture site , manufacture process , container closure . An agalsidase alfa bioreactor manufacturing process ( agalAF1 ) utilize animal component-free medium replace previous roller bottle ( RB ) process . This study design provide PD/PK safety data . The assessment schedule design capture PK profile drug uptake blood well pharmacologic effect manifest course week . Each patient serve control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The patient must diagnose Fabry disease use follow criterion : The patient hemizygous male Fabry disease confirm deficiency αgalactosidase A activity measure serum , leukocytes , fibroblast confirm mutation αgalactosidase A gene . 2 . Patient male 18 65 year age , inclusive . 3 . Patient must willing remain clinic require study comply procedure evaluation study . 4 . At time confirmation study eligibility visit , patient must receive least 26 week treatment RB Replagal dose 0.2 mg/kg administer IV EOW . 5 . Patient provide informed consent . Patients naive ERT : 1 . Treatment naive patient must pretreatment plasma Gb3 level normal range ( value available ) . 1 . Patient unable venipunctured and/or tolerate venous access . 2 . Patient test positive antiagalsidase alfa antibody either screen confirmation eligibility visit . 3 . Patient preERT plasma Gb3 level within normal range ( value available ) . 4 . Patient participate Shire HGT investigational study . 5 . Patient currently dialysis , expect begin dialysis study , receive kidney transplant , renal transplant wait list . 6 . Patient unable comply protocol ( eg , clinical relevant medical condition make implementation protocol difficult , unstable social situation , otherwise unlikely complete study ) , opinion Investigator , otherwise unsuited study . 7 . The patient enrol another clinical study involve clinical investigation use investigational product ( drug device ) , except Canadian Fabry Disease Initiative , within 6 month prior receive first dose AF Replagal study time study . 8 . The patient previously receive AF Replagal prior study entry .</criteria>
