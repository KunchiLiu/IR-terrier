	<brief_summary>Trauma surgeon throughout US begin use recombinant activate factor VII ( rFVIIa ) control severe hemorrhage follow injury traditional measure fail . Despite promising result several small study , remain several unanswered question regard use relatively expensive product injured patient include : - The timing administration - Selection appropriate patient likely benefit - The effective dose injure patient - The potential need repeat dose - The need administration platelets correction acidosis prior administer first dose - The risk associate use rFVIIa include venous and/or arterial thrombosis - The potential rFVIIa cause aggravate post-injury organ failure and/or infectious complication - An analysis cost versus benefit The purpose study collect large sample patient multiple institution order address issue list .
