	<detailed_description>There several proven strategy prevention recurrent ischemic stroke , include use statin , treatment hypertension , anticoagulation patient atrial fibrillation . Preliminary analysis suggest 9-15 % Kaiser Permanente Northern California â€™ ischemic stroke patient receive optimal care secondary prevention stroke . The purpose study determine whether quality improvement ( QI ) intervention improve care receive stroke patient . This project consist randomize trial standardize stroke discharge order form improve adherence best practice secondary stroke prevention . The primary research question : Is secondary prevention intervention , focused implementation standardize pre-printed discharge order hospitalists , effective increase utilization follow evidence-based treatment 6 month discharge ischemic stroke : ( 1 ) treatment statin , ( 2 ) control hypertension , ( 3 ) anticoagulation patient atrial fibrillation . The primary outcome proportion patient receive optimal treatment , define three goal . The impact intervention measure change after-to-before intervention hospital compare non-intervention ( control ) hospital , institution unit analysis . Secondary analysis evaluate impact intervention component 6-month 1-year rate mortality , readmission stroke , cost care discharge .</detailed_description>
