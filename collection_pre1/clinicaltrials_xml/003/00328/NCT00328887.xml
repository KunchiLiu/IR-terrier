	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical study focus enhance patient 's anti-tumor immune response individual esophageal cancer alter genetic repertoire tumor express CD40L , activator dendritic cell . This accomplished endoscopic administration tumor AdcuCD40L , adenovirus gene transfer vector express cod sequence human CD40L cDNA . This study design assess hypothesis safe administer AdcuCD40L vector individual esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Transfer CD40 Ligand Gene ( AdcuCD40L ) Patients With Esophageal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal cancer deadly disease , slow advance therapy several decade , despite rapid increase incidence . Esophageal cancer estimate seventh common malignancy worldwide , incidence rate reach epidemic proportion select region Asia Africa . In United States , estimate 12,300 new case diagnosed 2000 , however , incidence adenocarcinoma esophagus currently rise faster human malignant tumor country . Despite advance surgical technique , chemotherapy , radiotherapy early detection , 12 % patient diagnosed esophageal cancer survive five year , cure rate dismal see cancer breast , prostate , colon , even lung . Survival follow treatment esophageal cancer stage dependent . This study direct towards augment host anti-tumor immunity use gene transfer activate dendritic cell ( DC ; cell immune system play central role initiate immune response ) tumor patient esophageal cancer . Based extensive pre-clinical data , two propose clinical trial protocol evaluate concept transient modification genetic repertoire esophageal tumor express CD40 Ligand ( CD40L ; potent activator DC ) induce accumulation activate DC within tumor , vivo interaction DC tumor cells/tumor antigens induce tumor-specific immunity . To assess concept , adenovirus ( Ad ) vector ( AdcuCD40L ) use transfer transiently express human CD40L cDNA esophageal carcinoma direct injection tumor . Phase I represent dose escalation study determine maximum tolerate dose vector include 12 individual unresectable , stage III IV esophageal cancer . Phase II randomize , double-blinded assessment biologic efficacy include 24 individual resectable , stage I-III disease undergo potentially curative resection . Together , protocol design assess two hypothesis . First , safe administer AdcuCD40L vector individual esophageal cancer . Second , intratumoral administration AdCUCD40L vector induce accumulation , tumor regional lymph node , activate DC , CD8+ T cell ( inflammatory cell ) , include T cell exhibit tumor-specific response , well systemic antitumor immunity .</detailed_description>
