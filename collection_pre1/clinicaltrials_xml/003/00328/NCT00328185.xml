	<brief_title>Allograft Fibrosis Following Pediatric Cardiac Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There recent evidence demonstrate significant racial disparity outcome follow pediatric heart transplantation.Differences fibrosis regulation may offer explanation differences.Just pathologic alteration cardiac connective tissue ischemic heart cardiomyopathy support view matrix play fundamental role ventricular function , likely forms cardiac dysfunction , follow heart transplantation , may also relate change extracellular matrix.Fibrosis identify allograft follow transplant , although degree significance relative cardiac function remain unclear.Many regulatory substance also identify microenvironment allograft follow transplant , role collagen deposition protease : anti-protease balance unclear well.It speculate individual , racial , regional disparity outcome follow pediatric heart transplantation may result underlie difference fibrosis.This turn influence tolerance recipient graft , ultimately , time graft failure ensue.Of 4227 pediatric heart transplant perform US 1987-2004,717 African-American.The 1-year graft survival differ among group ; 5-year graft survival significantly low among African-Americans compare racial groups.The median graft survival African-American recipient 5.3 year compare 11.0 year recipients.African-American recipient increase likelihood HLA mismatch , low median household income.After adjust disparity multivariate analysis , African-American race remain significantly associate graft failure.While cellular component myocardium extensively study , extracellular matrix less well examined understood.Processes synthesis , degradation , turnover important understanding physiology development remodel tissue pathology hypertrophy fibrosis.Collagen Fibroblasts responsible biosynthesis , assembly , maintenance extracellular matrix . Collagen one component extracellular matrix.While collagen protein serve primarily inert structural support connective tissue , also control multiple cellular parameter adhesion , migration , cell shape , cytoskeletal architecture , gene expression.Fibronectin protein extracellular matrix.Fibronectin primarily serve adhesive protein , facilitate cell adhesion fibrin , collagen , heparin , proteoglycans.Fibronectin important contact inhibition , cell movement , cell-substrate adhesion , inflammation , wound healing.Another function fibronectin may home lymphocytic cells.Allograft rejection associate infiltration inflammatory cell local deposition fibronectin.Performing immunohistochemical analysis collagen fibronectin determine degree fibrosis serial endomyocardial biopsy duration graft survival.This data determine correlation allograft fibrosis clinical parameter cardiac function , uncover difference degree fibrosis may exist racial groups.The interaction cell , immune mediator , growth factor , protein regulate fibrosis well documented clinical areas.Throughout transplant literature , several point fibrosis cascade identify potential important regulatory component . These include transform growth factor-β , tumor necrosis factor-α , plasminogen activator inhibitor , matrix metalloproteinase-2 , matrix metalloproteinase-9.All possibility affect production collagen fibronectin , degree allograft fibrosis.Transforming growth factor-β many properties.TGF-β potential value immunosuppressant tissue.It serve anti-inflammatory agent base ability inhibit growth T B cells.TGF-β ability regulate growth depend surround cell type whether growth factor present.TGF-β stimulates fibroblast chemotaxis proliferation.As potent stimulator collagen synthesis , regulate deposition extracellular matrix cell attachment it.It induces fibronectin , chondroitin/dermatin sulfate proteoglycans , collagen , glycoaminoglycans.TGF-β promotes formation secretion protease inhibitor , contribute collagen accumulation.TGF-β decrease collagenase , increase tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases , increase PAI-1 production.Studies do implicate TGF-β pathogenesis small-airway fibrosis characteristic obliterative bronchiolitis follow lung transplant.TGF-β expression high OB patient comparison patient without OB , positive TGF-β staining precede histologic confirmation OB 6 months.TGF-β implicate contribute factor overproduction collagen characteristic dilate cardiomyopathy.Administration neutralize antibody TGF-β show limit collagen accumulation wounds.Tumor necrosis factor-α cytotoxic monokine produce macrophage . TNF-α associate inflammatory response present follow exposure bacterial endotoxin.TNF-α produce within first three day wound healing.It facilitates leukocyte recruitment , induces angiogenesis , promote fibroblast proliferation.In animal model , prominent feature acute allograft rejection dense deposition fibronectin graft site.Administration anti-TNF-α serum host abrogate acute rejection prolong allograft survival.It accompany decrease intragraft TNF-α level down-regulated fibronectin mRNA expression.Certain serine protease think key regulator connective tissue turnover.Plasminogen activator generate plasmin , serine protease , activity number connective tissue macromolecule , include fibronectin , proteoglycan core protein , glycoprotein , collagen , well fibrin.Plasmin show initiate autoactivation proteinases.The activity plasminogen activator closely regulate specific inhibitors.The plasminogen activator inhibitor potentially one important regulator connective tissue degradation control rate plasmin generation local environments.PAI-1 deposit pericellularly function regulate pericellular proteolysis.The connective tissue matrix metalloproteinase family consist enzymes derive mesenchymal cell hematopoietic cells.They metal-binding proteinase secrete proenzyme form require extracellular activation.The MMPs divide subgroup , one interstitial collagenases.This group responsible regulate extracellular collagen.Their activity regulate secrete inhibitor , tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases , form high-affinity irreversible complex active form MMP.Whether matrix production degradation occur depends relative amount metalloproteinases inhibitor also complex interplay serum inhibitors.In disease state control mechanisms become uncoordinated , uaction nature MMP activity may one factor lead imbalance extracellular matrix.Studies show increased expression several MMPs cardiac , renal , pulmonary allograft rejection.In animal , allograft presence MMP-9 show low cellular infiltration fibrosis allograft harvest MMP-9 deficient recipients.The reverse true MMP-2 , suggest MMP-2 MMP-9 may play different role process allograft fibrosis rejection.By perform immunohistochemical analysis , determine various amount potential regulatory substance serial endomyocardial biopsy duration graft survival.This data allow u compare change regulatory factor degree fibrosis time.It enable u uncover difference regulation may exist racial groups.During isovolumetric contraction phase systole , ventricular wall pressure develop rapidly.During ejection phase , pressure transmit ventricular cavity.Associated ejection , geometric change occur ventricle.Transmission force ventricle must involve myocardial matrix.Of structural protein heart , collagen physical property necessary force transmission ventricle.One conclude complex system compose primarily collagen necessary least systolic stress distribution tether myocytes one another spatial translocation accompany systole.For proper ventricular function , contiguous myocytes must stretch near amount.This implies mechanism distribution stress throughout entire ventricular wall.It appear total amount collagen present , also distribution may important.Increases decrease collagen note various disease state affect cardiac function.The pathologic alteration intrinsic cardiac connective tissue ischemic heart cardiomyopathy support view extracellular matrix play fundamental role ventricular function.Ischemic damage myocardium blood flow-mediated , time-dependent process.Even absence tissue necrosis , reversible loss contractile function.Although myocytes morphologically damage stun , may lose interconnection damage collagen extracellular matrix.The individual cell move relative without generate coordinate , forceful contractions.In animal , study show systolic bulging , mural thinning , region absent connective tissue.With congestive cardiomyopathy , ventricular dilation , global wall thinning diffuse contractile dysfunction.Although significant component ventricular dysfunction may relate loss contractile mass , region connective tissue absence within normal myocardium animal models.The untethering myocytes lead defective , uncoordinated contractile activity.Similarly , loss damage intrinsic connective tissue may account characteristic global wall thinning.This may lead spiral progressive damage ; ventricular cavity enlarges , end-diastolic pressure increase , thereby cause injury connective tissue.In contrast congestive cardiomyopathy , form heart disease associate decrease compliance diminish diastolic filling.Increased collagen demonstrate hypertrophied hearts.Rather thin-walled dilated heart , animal model demonstrate mural hypertrophy small ventricular cavity.In patient hypertrophic , obstructive cardiomyopathy , biopsy septum reveal severe myocellular hypertrophy , myocyte disorganization , pronounce interstitial collagen deposition.There increase component disorganization arrangement.After quantify degree fibrosis various amount regulatory substance , correlate data clinical parameters.We compare change fibrosis time measurement cardiac function , graft survival .</detailed_description>
