	<brief_summary>The etiology schizophrenia remain unclear . Schizophrenia patient reveal positive symptom , negative symptom , cognitive impairment . In addition dopamine system hyperactivity , hypofunction N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor play role pathophysiology schizophrenia . Consequently , enhance NMDA receptor neurotransmission consider novel treatment approach . To date , several trial NMDA enhancer report . For example , sarcosine ( N-methylglycine , glycine transporter I inhibitor ) show therapeutic effect chronically stable patient also acutely exacerbated one added-on antipsychotic . In addition , sarcosine yield excellent safety profile , comparison current antipsychotic . It remain unclear whether NMDA enhancer , sarcosine , serve monotherapy schizophrenia . The aim project examine efficacy safety sarcosine monotherapy acutely-ill schizophrenic patient , compare effect 2 grams/day , effective dose , 1 gram/day , ineffective low dose .</brief_summary>
