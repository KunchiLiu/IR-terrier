	<brief_title>Cardiac SPECT With Rotating Slant Hole Collimator</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myocardial perfusion SPECT recognize effective clinical diagnostic imaging technique assessment myocardial perfusion coronary artery disease . It important clinical application SPECT image technique . The goal conduct clinical pilot study evaluate use RMSSH SPECT detection myocardial defect especially sick patient nuclear medicine clinic , emergence room , intensive care unit . Comparison clinical utility cardiac RMSSH SPECT technique conventional cardiac planar SPECT parallel-hole collimation also allow u evaluate potential application technique wider patient population . The objective study test hypothesis quantitative 99mTc myocardial perfusion RMSSH SPECT provide similar diagnostic accuracy patient cardiac disease conventional SPECT image technique .</detailed_description>
