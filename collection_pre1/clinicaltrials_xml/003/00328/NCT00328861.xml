	<brief_summary>Background : - Natural killer ( NK ) cell large lymphocyte ( type white blood cell ) important immune response cancer . - IL-2 ( Aldesleukin ) substance body make control growth function many type cell . The Food Drug Administration approve IL-3 treat metastatic melanoma kidney cancer . ( Metastatic disease cancer spread beyond primary site . ) Objectives : To determine safety effectiveness treat metastatic melanoma kidney cancer laboratory-treated NK cell IL-2 . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old metastatic melanoma kidney cancer previously treat high-dose IL-2 . Design : - Leukapheresis . Patients leukapheresis obtain NK cell treatment regimen . Blood collect needle arm vein direct cell separator machine white blood cell extract . The rest blood return patient needle arm . NK cell remove white blood cell treat re-infusion patient . - Chemotherapy . Starting 8 day infusion treat NK cell , patient receive intravenous ( IV , vein ) infusion cyclophosphamide fludarabine suppress immune system . - NK cell infusion . Patients receive 30-minute IV infusion NK cell 2 day last dose chemotherapy . - IL-2 therapy . Within 24 hour NK cell infusion , patient receive high-dose IL-2 15-minute IV infusion every 8 hour 5 day . A second cycle IL-2 give 14 day first . - Blood test biopsy . Patients frequent blood test treatment period may ask undergo biopsy ( surgical removal small piece tumor lymph node ) end treatment look effect treatment tumor immune cell . - Follow-up evaluation . Patients evaluate 4-6 week complete treatment . They physical examination , scan tumor site , blood test blood sample ( leukapheresis ) examine response treatment . Patients improve treatment return evaluation every month . Those whose tumor grow originally shrink may receive one additional treatment course .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Natural killer ( NK ) cell large granular lymphocyte critical effector cell early innate immune response pathogens cancer . - Previous current clinical investigation clearly demonstrate T lymphocyte mediate regression metastatic melanoma . However , patient cancer eligible type immunotherapy either resectable tumor available , TIL expand sufficiently , tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) proliferate exhibit sufficient tumor specific reactivity . - We recently develop technique vitro isolation expansion anti-tumor NK cell level suitable treatment cancer patient propose protocol evaluate therapy use NK cell . - In Surgery Branch pre-clinical experiment , evaluate lysis fresh melanoma cell digest , melanoma cell line , renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) line , normal peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) NK cell several patient demonstrate NK cell could lyse fresh melanoma digest , well melanoma cell line renal cell cancer ( RCC ) line , spar normal allogeneic autologous PBMCs . Objectives : - Determine ability administration autologous natural killer ( NK ) cell plus aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) follow non-myeloablative lymphodepleting preparative regimen mediate tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma kidney cancer . - Determine rate repopulation natural killer cell treat patient . - Determine toxicity treatment regimen . Eligibility : - Patients , 18 year age old metastatic melanoma metastatic kidney cancer previously receive high dose IL-2 , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 1 . - Patients may active systemic infection , coagulation disorder , major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system form autoimmune disease immunodeficiency . Patients must eligible receive high-dose IL-2 . Design : - Patients undergo apheresis 03-C-0277 ( Cell Harvest Preparation Surgery Branch Adoptive Cell Therapy Protocols ) obtain cell generation autologous natural killer cell . - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day IV ) day -8 -7 fludarabine ( 25 mg/m^2/day IV ) day -6 -2 . - On day 0 patient receive infusion autologous natural killer lymphocytes begin first cycle high-dose IL-2 ( 720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hour 15 dos ) . A second cycle IL-2 administer approximately 14 day later . - Clinical Immunologic response evaluate 4 6 week second cycle IL-2 . -Using small optimal Phase II design , two cohort patient , initially 16 cohort , enrol , least one first 16 patient clinical response ( partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) ) , accrual continue 29 patient , target 15 % goal objective response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients must previously receive high dose IL2 ( aldesleukin ) either nonresponders ( progressive disease ) recur . 2 . Patients great equal 18 year age , must measurable metastatic melanoma metastatic kidney cancer tumor reactive T cell available cell transfer therapy . 3 . Pathology metastatic melanoma metastatic kidney cancer confirm National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Laboratory Pathology . 4 . Patients gender must willing practice birth control four month receive preparative regimen . 5 . Clinical performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 0 , 1 . 6 .

Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less three time upper limit normal . 10 . Serum creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dl . 11 . Total bilirubin less equal 2.0 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert 's Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . 12 . Must willing sign durable power attorney . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Less four week elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , less six week since prior nitrosurea therapy . 2 . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect preparative chemotherapy fetus infant . 3 . Life expectancy less three month . 4 . Systemic steroid therapy require . 5 . Any active systemic infection , coagulation disorder major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system , evidence positive stress thallium comparable test , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease . 6 . Any form autoimmune disease ( autoimmune colitis Crohn 's Disease ) . 7 . Seropositive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immune competence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) 8 . Seropositive hepatitis B C antigen . 9 . Seronegative EpsteinBarr virus ( EBV ) . 10 . Patients eligible receive highdose Aldesleukin evaluate follow : 1 . Patients 50 year old great normal stress cardiac test ( stress thallium , stress multigated acquisition scan ( MUGA ) , dobutamine echocardiogram , stress test ) exclude . 2 . Patients history electrocardiogram ( EKG ) abnormality , symptom cardiac ischemia arrhythmia normal stress cardiac test ( stress thallium , stress MUGA , dobutamine echocardiogram , stress test ) exclude . 3 .
