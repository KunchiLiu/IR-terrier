	<brief_title>Safety Regular Diet First Meal Patients Who Underwent Surgical Treatment Gynecologic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paralytic ileus , temporary inhibition bowel motility , believe follow abdominal surgery . Surgeons customarily withhold postoperative oral intake return bowel function evidence presence bowel sound , pass flatus/stool , feel hungry . The major concern early oral intake would result vomit severe paralytic ileus subsequent aspiration pneumonia , wound dehiscence , anastomotic leakage . Recently , practice delay postoperative oral intake challenge evidence extensive gastrointestinal physiologic study examine contractile activity intestine . These data suggest concept postoperative ileus paralysis entire bowel complete absence functional contractile activity misleading . If postoperative ileus take place , usually transient significant clinically . Several possible clinical benefit early feed surgery exist include good wound healing , postoperative stress ulcer prevention , reduce sepsis , improve sense well , short length hospital stay , cost saving . Currently , practice early administration liquid diet surgery become widely accept . For early regular diet administration , propose additional benefit would lesser risk aspiration , fast recovery intestinal motility , good nutritional status . Patients surgery treatment gynecologic cancer deserve special attention regard generally high risk develop postoperative ileus due extensive and/or multiple intraabdominal surgical procedure include radical hysterectomy , pelvic lymph node dissection , surgical staging procedure . At time , group patient would benefit aforementioned positive effect early regular diet feeding . Comparisons : Regular versus liquid diet first postoperative meal first day surgery clinically early-stage gynecologic cancer .</detailed_description>
