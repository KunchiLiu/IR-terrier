	<detailed_description>Background : Existing criterion AS/SpA mod . New York , ESSG , Amor criterion classification and/or diagnosis spondyloarthritis limitation apply early disease . Moreover , MRI part establish criterion precise role MRI early axial disease fully define yet . Even less known sacroiliac ( SI ) change SpA patient peripheral symptom . A pilot study use data 'paper patient ' lead new candidate criterion early spondyloarthritis . Subsequently , member ASAS International Working Group decide conduct prospective multi-centre study evaluate ( validate ) new candidate criterion , assess performance diagnostic criterion . Aims study : 1 . To evaluate new candidate criterion axial SpA multi-centre setting . 2 . To assess potential role new candidate criterion use diagnostic criterion . To accomplish , inclusion consecutive undiagnosed patient mandatory long period follow-up . 3 . To compare criterion encompass whole group SpA ESSG Amor criterion criterion tailor either predominant axial disease predominant peripheral disease . To accomplish , patient predominant axial disease ( back pain ) also patient predominant peripheral disease ( arthritis/enthesitis ) include . Participating centre : All ASAS member work clinical practice invite participate study . More one ASAS member/ rheumatologist per centre may participate . Inclusion criterion : Include newly refer patient - onset symptom ( back pain / arthritis / enthesitis ) &lt; 45 year - undiagnosed* disease follow symptom : - chronic back pain ( duration back pain 3 month ) - / peripheral arthritis ( asymmetric arthritis / predominantly low limb ) - / enthesitis - / dactylitis - Definition 'undiagnosed ' : The patient refer department chronic back pain , arthritis , enthesitis dactylitis diagnose confidently refer physician/rheumatologist SpA definitely SpA . If refer physician/GP/rheumatologist suspect SpA certain , patient consider undiagnosed . Endpoints study : - Primary endpoint : diagnosis make rheumatologist ( ASAS member ) diagnostic work-up . This expert diagnosis serf preliminary gold standard various criterion compare . Final gold standard outcome ( diagnosis ) long-term follow . - Secondary endpoint : diagnosis make rheumatologist 2 5 year , respectively , first assessment . Thus , patient invite follow-up visit 2 5 year , respectively . Further study rule : - Include newly refer patient strictly consecutively long meet inclusion criterion . - The decision include patient base solely fulfilment inclusion criterion , make ideally make final diagnosis ( prospective study design ) . - Patients diagnose confidently correctly refer physician prior refer department include study . - If unable perform MRIs clinical set include patient undiagnosed chronic back pain . - If want include patient undiagnosed chronic back pain , perform MRI sacroiliac ( SI ) joint first 10 patient axial SpA first 10 patient non-SpA related ( mechanical ) back pain . In subsequent patient may perform MRIs need clinical ground . ( Explanation : minimum number MRIs SpA non-SpA patient several centre necessary obtain reliable result sensitivity specificity MRI early axial SpA . ) - MRI SI joint patient peripheral symptom perform select centre ( centre already indicate whether possible ) . - MRI result take provided local centre ( either read radiologist rheumatologist , whoever great experience ) . Results categorize 'presence absence active inflammatory lesion compatible SpA ' , 'presence absence chronic lesion compatible sacroiliitis/spondylitis ' . ( Selected centre invite send u MRIs validation locally perform reading ( intention increase quality data ) . - Plain radiographs SI joint lumbar spine mandatory patient undiagnosed chronic back pain . Previously take radiograph acceptable old 6 month . Results take provide locally either radiologist rheumatologist , whoever great experience . - At end diagnostic work , preliminary diagnosis must make ASAS rheumatologist do usual daily clinic . It important absolutely confident diagnosis stage since ) reflect daily practice , ii ) level confidence diagnosis assess well . ( It important include patient consecutively centre order avoid selection bias . ) The senior ASAS member supervise physician experience SpA her/his department participate study . - Patients peripheral symptom include meet inclusion criterion . Patients peripheral symptom history chronic back pain concomitant chronic back pain must undergo radiographic examination SI joint . Patients non-specific musculoskeletal pain arthralgia ( without arthritis ) include . Data documentation : The result clinical history , physical examination , blood test , radiograph , MRIs , diagnosis enter CRF locally ASAS member during/after diagnostic work-up . The diagnosis make local rheumatologist ( ASAS member experience colleague centre ) . The complete CRF send coordinate centre ( Berlin ) data check data entry . A copy CRF remain locally study centre . The name , date birth , address , telephone number must also keep locally centre since follow-up assessment 2 year 5 year plan . Sample size inclusion period : It estimate 400-500 patient SpA ( ca 250-300 axial 150-200 peripheral SpA ) complete data set need allow reliable comparison new candidate criterion establish criterion . Since prevalence SpA among newly refer patient unclear diagnosis varies centre centre calculation control group size ( thus total sample size ) bound inaccurate . Therefore , proposal centre recruit many consecutive patient possible indicated study coordinator stop inclusion . The study coordinator adequately terminate inclusion period complete CRFs send within reasonably short period time ( &lt; 2 week ) coordinate centre . Data entry data analysis do coordinate centre . DNA/RNA-analysis biomarker analysis : In addition clinical study aim arrive new classification diagnostic criterion , two group research perform laboratory experiment patient select centre : Genetic polymorphism gene product ( RNA ) potentially associate spondyloarthritis analyse Prof. Matthew Brown Brisbane , Australia . A second group researcher ( Prof. Walter Maksymowych , Canada , Prof. Mikkel Ostergaard , Denmark , Prof . Rob Inman , US , Prof. David Yu , US ) analyse several biomarkers cartilage break-down bone formation proteins serum and/or plasma . Data experimental project may potential diagnostic value future and/or may reveal novel insight pathophysiological mechanism spondyloarthritis . Longterm follow-up : A second follow-up visit patient 2 year first encounter also 5 year first encounter highly warrant since diagnosis may change time final diagnosis long-term follow important gold standard . Thus , record containing name , address , phone number patient include study must store locally study site . The patient best inform first visit follow-up assessment 2 5 year later envisage .</detailed_description>
