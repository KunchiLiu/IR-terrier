	<brief_summary>The overall goal study well understand cholesterol absorb utilized body ( metabolism ) serum cholesterol affect development harden artery ( atherosclerosis ) . The purpose aim 1 assess role amount different bile acid intestine affect absorption , synthesis digestion cholesterol . The effect bile acid fast gall bladder empty release hormone blood meal also study . The purpose aim 2 assess role phospholipid ( fat contain element phosphorus ) intestine affect absorption , synthesis digestion cholesterol normal people people genetic condition ( mdr3 deficiency ) affect phospholipid bile acid metabolism . The purpose aim 3 assess role material act like detergent call Pluronic F-68 known block absorption cholesterol . The purpose aim 4 determine cholesterol food cholesterol make body digested absorb differently .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cholesterol absorption play key role cholesterol homeostasis understanding lumenal event play key role absorption remain poorly understood . The aims present study fourfold : 1 ) To determine whether previously observe effect cholesterol absorption bile acid feed related change pool size intestinal transit meal stimulate gall bladder empty plasma cholecystokinin level . 2 ) To determine effect dietary sphingomyelin cholesterol absorption , micellar solubilization synthesis normal adult assess effect intralumenal cholesterol solubilization , absorption synthesis adult heterozygous mdr 3 deficiency ( defect lead low biliary phospholipid content ) . 3 ) To determine mechanism action non-ionic detergent , Pluronic F-68 , evaluate effect cholesterol solubilization distribution micelle vesicle , cholesterol absorption synthesis . 4 ) To evaluate intralumenal solubilization distribution within micelle vesicle biliary compare dietary cholesterol human assess impact ezetimibe treatment absorption endogenous exogenous cholesterol assess absorption human content biliary divert , rat lymph fistula model . For aim , subject study consume well-controlled diet outpatients combination human animal technique . Techniques employ human study include state-of-the art technique utilize stable isotope isotope ratio mass spectrometry , gas chromatography . Translational study animal use include novel technique measure fat absorption well use lymph fistula rat model assessment lipid absorption hamster assessment bile acid sterol synthesis . Integration animal/human technique provide tool characterize role modification intralumenal environment cholesterol solubilization human cholesterol absorption synthesis .</detailed_description>
