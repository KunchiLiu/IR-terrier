	<brief_summary>It anticipate use tissue oxygen monitoring measure brain tissue oxygen deltoid muscle oxygen provide precise information focal brain ischemia systemic hypoperfusion current technique measure blood pressure , heart rate intracranial pressure . Understanding relationship tissue oxygen tension collect brain deltoid muscle critically injured patient could lead broad understanding important metabolic cellular event occur follow severe injury change induce therapeutic intervention . Furthermore , use intervention design improve tissue hypoxia , measure low brain muscle tissue oxygen , may improve mortality neurological recovery systemic trauma head trauma compare current approach involve tissue metabolic monitoring .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Tissue Oxygen Monitoring Critically Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational , cohort study design investigate metabolic change brain deltoid muscle injured patient . Study objectives follow : - To establish critical , abnormal level tissue oxygen brain ( PbrO2 ) muscle ( PmO2 ) injure patient . - To correlate PbrO2 currently available diagnostic measure use head-injured patient , include ICP , mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) , CPP , SjO2 , CT finding , neurological examination , clinical outcome traumatic brain injury . - To correlate PmO2 base deficit measurement , standard physiologic variable , near infra-red oxygen level , infectious complication , outcome critically injured patient . Investigators enroll patient multisystem trauma include brain injury . In addition result obtain oxygen monitoring , data collect prospectively include : 1 . Baseline Characteristics- mechanism injury , arrival blood pressure GCS , result image procedure , age , gender , blood gas analysis , injury injury severity , operative procedure , 2 . ICU Care - MAP , ICP , CPP , base deficit , oxygen saturation , CVP , cardiac output , GCS score , short-term outcome data , infectious complication organ dysfunction . All physiological data download automatically continuously bedside monitor , ventilator , oxygen monitor via study-dedicated computer customize software ( Aristein Bioinformatics , Palo Alto , CA ) .</detailed_description>
