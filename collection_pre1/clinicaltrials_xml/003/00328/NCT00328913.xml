	<brief_summary>The aim study show evidence efficacy 5-HTP induce satiety reduce food intake ( confirmatory study ) . The primary objective present study determine : - effectiveness 5-HTP preparation satiety marker ( intake meal day ) The secondary objective present study determine effectiveness 5-HTP preparation : - food consumption ( amount composition ) free meal ( dinner ) ; - wellness one week supplementation ; - intermeal interval ; - body weight waist-hip ratio ( WHR ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect 5-Hydroxytryptophan ( 5-HTP ) Satiety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One physiological factor regulate food intake pattern satiety . Satiety define absence ingestive motivation , end next meal initiate ( Blundell et al. , 1996 ) . Food intake affect number physiological objective parameter blood know involved signalling satiety , glucose ( Melanson et al , 1999 ; Chapman et al , 1999 ; Campfield et al , 1996 ) , insulin ( Speechly et al , 2000 ) cholecystokinin ( CCK ) ( Gutzwiller et al. , 2000 ; Beglinger et al. , 2001 ; French et al. , 2000 ; Degen et al. , 2001 ; Burton-Freeman et al. , 2002 , 2004 ) . More recently , gastric hormone ghrelin identify marker hunger meal initiation ( De Graaf et al. , 2004 ) . Humans eat response metabolic physiological need . Humans also respond significant extent internal subjective emotional signal ( clue ) . The exact relation physiological internal signal subjective emotional internal signal know . Besides also external social factor modulate physiological-derived hunger satiety signal . Though regulation food intake study quite extensively , underlie mechanism elucidate yet still new factor involve regulation find . It known macronutrients lipid , proteins carbohydrate affect satiety differently , mechanism still clear either . Nowadays , food supplement become available suggest affect hunger satiety sensation , result long-term weight loss . For example dietary fibre know satiate effect . The food supplement 5-HTP use purpose well . The food supplement , already available United States Italy , investigate multiple indication migraine , depression , anxiety , fibromyalgia , hypertension , insomnia obesity . Different clinical study perform 5-HTP three decade . With respect lower food intake , 5-HTP study well . 5-HTP amino acid produce human body essential amino acid L-tryptophan , find food product . Its clinical value ability increase production serotonin . As potentially valuable supplement use clinically 30 year . 5-HTP occurs naturally two place â€“ human body seed Griffonia simplicifolia , West African medicinal plant . 5-HTP amino acid precursor serotonin . Normal level serotonin important emotional well-being , may play role appetite suppression , decrease carbohydrate fat intake . Only free plasma tryptophan cross blood brain barrier via carrier protein enter central nervous system ( CNS ) . Once CNS , tryptophan convert 5-HTP decarboxylated serotonin . The level , possible function , several neurotransmitter influence supply dietary product . A reduction tryptophan correlate reduction serotonin ( Curcio et al. , 2005 ) . The 5-HTP metabolism influence plasma tryptophan level , relate food intake . Serotonin synthesis directly dependent availability specific precursor tryptophan nutritional status . The effect 5-HTP intake food intake mood base serotonin production . Numerous study show long-term consumption 5-HTP ( level 900 mg daily ) reduce food intake result weight loss . In previous study Laboratoire Oenobiol moderately overweight men age 20-40 year , give 50 150 mg 5-HTP half hour lunch half hour dinner , reduce energy intake 300 mg 5-HTP compare placebo find . This supply acutely one day . The study report linear dose related effect , significant food intake inhibition effect 300 mg/day 5-HTP dose . The dose 100 mg/day produce statistically significant effect compare placebo . However , 100 mg 5-HTP could prove sufficient give chronic administration condition . In present study therefore subject supply 100 mg 5-HTP daily one week . Hunger satiety feeling , food intake wellness investigate . The study conduct overweight woman , assume group subject target group .</detailed_description>
