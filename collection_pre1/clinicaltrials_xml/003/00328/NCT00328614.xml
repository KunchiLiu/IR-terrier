	<brief_title>Samarium-153 With Neoadjuvant Hormonal Radiation Therapy Locally Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The likelihood prostate cancer cell metastasize bone early important influence natural history prostate cancer . Bone-targeted therapy , give sequentially hormonal therapy ( androgen suppression ) radiation therapy , prolongs progression disease clinically non-metastatic prostate cancer patient . The use Samarium-153 EDTMP conjunction hormonal therapy external beam radiation therapy never previously evaluate high risk clinically localized prostate cancer . Many patient high-risk prostate cancer develop progressive disease within 2 year therapy indicate subclinical metastatic disease may present time initial diagnosis . In high-risk patient , may therapeutic benefit combine hormonal therapy external beam radiation therapy Samarium-153 EDTMP treat localize subclinical bony disease , respectively .</detailed_description>
