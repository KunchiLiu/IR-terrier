	<brief_summary>We seek determine efficacy NAET® permanently eliminate milk allergy sample patient . We hypothesize subject experimental group show similar level allergy sensitivities initially nine diagnostic measure use . After receive NAET treatment , Experimental group demonstrate significant reduction milk sensitivity allergy compare control group final evaluation use diagnostic measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Milk ALLERGY ELIMINATION THROUGH NAET® ( Nambudripad 's Allergy Elimination Techniques ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Although several standard clinical technique use detect treat common allergic condition , one limit scope require follow repeat treatment protocol . The non-invasive system know NAET® generally limitation last twenty-three year demonstrate effective clinically thousand case . NAET® natural treatment utilizes standard medical diagnostic measure along kinesiolgocal , chiropractic oriental testing , procedure identify allergen , well intensity reaction allergens vary individual individual . Treatment consist sequence spinal manipulation specific thoracic lumbar spinal level along acupuncture acupressure configuration standard acupuncture point . Methods : In double blind study , 26 patient diagnosed milk allergy ( 13 male , 13 female , age range 18-65 year ) randomly assign 2 group : 1 . NAET®/Experimental group , 2 . Placebo/control group The study conduct 12 volunteer-clinicians NAET Research associate , divide six investigator group . Each group conduct designate sequential part study independently group , , blind group duration study . Subjects group ( Experimental Control ) evaluate immediatedly treatment eight week thereafter use follow nine diagnostic measure : Subjective history ( Allergy Symptom Rating Scale ASRS ) ; ALCAT Test ; antibody milk protein blood serum Immunoglobulins G , Immunoglobulins A , Immuno-globulins M , Immunoglobulins E ( IgG , IgA , IgM , IgE ) Elisa method ( enzyme link Immunozorbant Assay ) ; Intradermal test milk sensitivity . NSTRS ( Kinesiological muscle response test also know Neuromuscular Sensitivity Testing ) Pulse difference Rating Scale ( PDRS ) test two well train NST clinicians two different time treatment . Both group demonstrate allergic sensitivity whole milk test sample vary degree . After complete evaluation , Experimental group receive 2 NAET® treatment whole milk , two consecutive Saturdays . The Placebo group receive two treatment placebo sample day along experimental group two consecutive Saturdays well . At end treatment phase , group evaluate whole milk test sample use nine diagnostic measure . Results On nine diagnostic measure significant difference mean measure Experimental group , remain almost Placebo group . At 95 % CI , p-values less 0.05 test except IgG study ( p-value=1.30 ) . NSTRS PDRS evaluate two clinician different time evaluate intertester relability among two clinician two test . A significant correlation notice result tester receive two testing–NST PDRS ( p-value &lt; 0.0001 ) . Conclusion The study demonstrate efficacy eliminate reduce milk allergy use NAET® treatment protocol . This study also evaluate reliability perform two test procedure ( NST &amp; PDRS ) two independent examiner test subject milk two different time . There significant correlation result receive show , two clinician test subject independently , demonstrate good reliability well trained clinician performance two evaluation .</detailed_description>
