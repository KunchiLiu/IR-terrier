	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety BIO-K + CL1285 Prevention Antibiotic-associated Diarrhea Hospitalized Adult Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antibiotic-associated diarrhea ( AAD ) one frequent adverse event follow antibiotherapy lead cause diarrhea hospitalize patient . Ten 25 % AAD cause bacteria Clostridium difficile . A recent unicenter study conduct Maisonneuve-Rosemont hospital demonstrate preventive role Bio-K + CL1285 antibiotic-associated diarrhea Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea . Its preventive role think mainly restoration gastrointestinal flora affect part antibiotherapy . A wide body literature reveal clinical use probiotic , well control prospective study conduct large number subject perform . In light positive preliminary result obtain limited number patient AAD paucity well control clinical trial , wish undertake randomize , double blind , multicentre study evaluate efficacy safety Bio-K + CL1285 prophylaxis vs. placebo prevention antibiotic-associated diarrhea hospitalize adult patient . As secondary objective , also intend evaluate incidence Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea demonstrate BIO-K + CL1285 agent improve clinical outcome also reduce health care expenditure .</detailed_description>
