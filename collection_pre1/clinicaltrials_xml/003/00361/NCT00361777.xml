These symptom see many disorder well , complicate diagnosis . The reliability test currently use diagnose Cushing syndrome know . To test accuracy , subject study test positive Cushing syndrome evaluate NIH 2 year either confirm refute laboratory result . Patients 18 75 year age treat George Washington University Weight Management Program ( GWUWMP ) may participate study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , measurement body fat , blood test , oral glucose tolerance test . They also complete symptom checklist quality life questionnaire . Participants test Cushing syndrome saliva collection , 24-hour urine collection , dexamethasone suppression test ( DST ) . For DST take 1 mg dexamethasone night report GWUWMP next morning blood draw . All specimen blood , saliva , urine test cortisol level . People whose test result abnormal see NIH outpatient clinic medical history , physical examination , blood test ; bedtime saliva collection ; two 24-hour urine collection ; 2-day 2-mg DST , follow administration corticotropin-releasing hormone ( CRH ) . CRH naturally occur hormone cause cortisol level rise . Pre-treatment dexamethasone prevents CRH cause increase cortisol healthy people , patient Cushing syndrome . For 2-day DST , subject take 0.5 mg dexamethasone every 6 hour eight dos . Two hour last dose , CRH inject catheter ( thin plastic tube ) insert arm vein . Blood drawn give CRH measure dexamethasone cortisol level give CRH measure cortisol level . People whose test result normal see NIH . Those high cortisol level repeat urine saliva test every 2 8 week 24 month , 1-mg DST every 3 month routine clinic visit GWUWMP . People whose increased cortisol find due another condition besides Cushing syndrome refer evaluation possible treatment .

Thus , important screen treatable disorder prevent associate morbidity mortality . Because many sign Cushing 's syndrome common general population , information cost-effectiveness diagnostic efficiency various screening test would useful . This study evaluate diagnostic performance various screen test Cushing 's syndrome overweight patient recruit weight loss center additional sign disorder .
