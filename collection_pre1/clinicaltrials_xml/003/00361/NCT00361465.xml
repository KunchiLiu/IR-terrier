	<brief_summary>Dystonia rare disease lead severe handicap . It primary secondary origin . It characterize sustained muscle contraction , frequently cause twist repetitive movement abnormal posture . These disorder believe caused dysfunction basal ganglion ( BG ) circuitry , mechanism largely unknown . A good understanding disorder require significant improvement phenomenological description relation aetiology . We want identify specific motor signature different form dystonia . To aim , ask patient perform movement various complexity , record chronometric , kinematics EMG data . The characteristic patient ' movement compare match control subject . We examine abnormal co-activation distal proximal muscle evaluate characteristic loss selectivity motor command mobile vs. fix dystonia . Consistency motor output pattern compare three group patient . We also study possible cognitive limbic component disease , examine influence cognitive emotional load movement production . Eventually want refine criterion use classify different form disease , thus enable clinician well predict likely outcome particular therapeutic procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A major difficulty hinder progress understand dystonia fact accurate description motor sign associate different form disease presently lack . Indeed , different form disease yield symptom distinguish basis current clinical evaluation . We hypothesize multiple pathophysiological mechanism appear underlie motor symptom dystonia induce somewhat different behavioural expression disease , also respond differently deep brain stimulation . As proximal muscle involve postural limb stabilisation , propose study distal , also proximal contra-lateral diffusion motor command . Our hypothesis movement EMG pattern diverge depend aetiology disease task condition . In word , expect identify kinematics EMG signatures specific different form dystonia . One first step towards improve knowledge dystonia thus scrutinize motor output behavioural level , relate abnormal movement pattern specific aetiology disease . Thus , three group patient present dystonia know aetiology ( ON OFF dystonia Parkinson Disease , Primary dystonia , Secondary dystonia ) include study , well two group age-matched control subject . The first step experimental approach consist study kinematics EMG pattern movement perform different group patient . For study motor control upper limb , ask patient perform wrist movement isolation , association superimpose motor , cognitive emotional task . The organisation abnormalities movement low limb study follow rationale , whenever possible . Because occurrence involuntary movement many patient dystonia , behavioural recording perform use telemetric equipment . This guarantee patient pull captor , run risk get hurt recording session . The measure include reaction movement time , well angular displacement relevant joint bilateral EMG activity distal proximal muscle limbs . The spatio-temporal characteristic patient ' movement analyze use record chronometric , kinematics EMG data , compare age-matched control subject . Muscle activity movement record different level move contralateral limb thoroughly monitor overflow characteristic dystonia . Dystonic bradykinesia think related loss selectivity motor command , particular diffusion antagonist group . If hypothesis correct , expect observe abnormal co-activation antagonist group distal level . Because postural component dystonia , also expect see undue diffusion motor command proximal muscle . Finally , look sign mirror movement indicate perturbation inter-hemispheric motor inhibition . The abnormal co-activation antagonist proximal muscle increase double motor task condition , patient ask perform symmetrical different movement simultaneously two limb . Based hypothesis symmetrical coupling motor effector easier control asymmetrical pattern , require inter-hemispheric inhibition irrelevant movement , motor performance difficult diffusion motor command increase asymmetrical motor task . Under condition movement , consistency record pattern kinematics EMG data compare three group patient . Regarding secondary dystonia , whenever relevant , also correlate observe pattern exist cerebral lesion . We attempt find connection clinical phenotype patient measure movement parameter . For example , kinematics EMG data put relation main type symptom display patient ( mobile vs. fix dystonia ) , distribution symptom . The hypothesis dystonia pure motor disease test use double task experimental protocol . Patients request perform arm movement , 1 ) perform simultaneous cognitive task , count backwards detect specific visual stimulus , divert attentional resource .</detailed_description>
