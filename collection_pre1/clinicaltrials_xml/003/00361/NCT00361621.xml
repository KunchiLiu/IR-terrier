	<detailed_description>- This single arm phase 2 study CHOP/Rituxan plus VELCADE follow involved field radiotherapy design evaluate complete response chemotherapy determine PET scan follow six cycle therapy . One cycle equal 21 day . - For cycle , Day 1 , patient receive VELCADE intravenously , follow rituxan , follow CHOP chemotherapy . Before receive drug , patient give standard medication ( Tylenol , Benadryl ) help minimize side effect . They also continue take prednisone mouth day 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 . On Day 4 , patient receive another dose VELCADE . - Before begin every cycle study treatment , follow perform : Medical history ; physical examination ; routine blood test . After 3rd 6th cycle study treatment , patient test monitor status disease . These include PET scan , CT scan , standard blood test . - After 6 cycle chemotherapy , approximately 3 week radiation therapy begin . One month complete radiation therapy , patient return clinic physical exam blood test . One month later , follow evaluation occur : PET CT scan ; medical history ; physical exam ; routine blood test . - There follow-up visit every 3 month two year study treatment complete .</detailed_description>
