	<brief_summary>Approximately 15 percent couple experience infertility , yet abnormality detect man woman . In number couple , embryo unexpectedly slow growth stop growth completely . Some situation may genetically determine . For instance , portion case may cause poor egg quality relate genetic functional deficiency heretofore unidentified human maternal effect gene . A model develop unexplained fertility create mouse line lack critical maternal effect gene . ( Maternal effect gene produce mRNA protein accumulate egg require normal early embryonic development . ) This pilot project test hypothesis similar defect may cause human infertility . Thirty cubic centimeter blood collected 40 woman clinical history consistent defective maternal effect gene . DNA blood cell examine store . Some blood cell treat frozen grown laboratory produce DNA future . If certain mutation find , mean prevalence mutation less 10 percent , investigator may initiate another study 100 woman . If common mutation find least four patient , investigator seek collect DNA 150 normal fertile control woman comparison . This project purely investigational ; therefore , finding share participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The pilot investigation examine hypothesis human infertility may cause mutation human MATER gene . We determine prevalence mutation select group woman clinical infertility history consistent possible defect maternal effect gene . After obtain informed consent DNA 100 woman , relevant mutation MATER gene search single strand conformation polymorphism analysis .</detailed_description>
