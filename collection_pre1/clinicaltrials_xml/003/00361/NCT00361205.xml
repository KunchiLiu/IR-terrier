	<brief_summary>Patients Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) depend medication relief motor symptom , reason often assume medicate carefully . Overall , medication adherence good , subset 15 20 % case take less 80 % total prescribed dose . However , irregular time drug ingestion almost universal , perhaps contribute fluctuate symptom drug regimen complexity . Pulsatile dopaminergic stimulation basal ganglion implicate development manifestation motor complication advance PD . Irregular medication intake likely contribute peak troughs serum brain drug level . In disease , patient adherence prescribe medication improve simplify drug regimen , provide additional education , counsel behavioural approach provide reminder packaging . We test effect time medicine ingestion educational approach , patient give detailed additional information continuous dopaminergic theory .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Electronic Compliance Monitoring Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients attend regional movement disorder clinic idiopathic PD ( UK Brain Bank criterion ) prescribe one antiparkinson drug ( include dopamine agonist levodopa ) invite participate . Patients unable manipulate electronic pill monitor bottle , whose compliance would adversely affect use electronic pill monitor bottle ( e.g . reliant compliance aid ) exclude . The study receive ethic approval sign consent obtain . During study medication adjust accord clinical need . The increase levodopa equivalent unit study period calculate accord establish formula [ 12 ] . Baseline assessment unify Parkinson ’ disease rating scale ( UPDRS ) , Hoehn Yahr , Schwab England , mini-mental state examination , geriatric depression scale quality life score ( PDQ 39 ) perform . Clinical score blind patient group perform ‘ ’ state . The UPDRS 3 adverse event record visit . The quality life score ( PDQ 39 ) repeat final visit . All antiparkinson drug monitor two 3 month period ( educational intervention ) use electronic monitoring pill bottle ( MEMS® , Aardex , Switzerland ) , device record time date bottle opening . Patients randomly assign ( computer generate placed opaque envelope ) active ( counsel ) group give verbal write information continuous dopaminergic theory , write advice optimal medicine timing tailor drug regimen . The counsel explain health , brain dopamine constant , fluctuation Parkinson ’ medication minimise simulate normal dopamine level . Control patient receive standard care , also medication intake monitor use MEMS device . Timing compliance ( percentage dose take correct time interval ) calculate use time interval optimise pharmacokinetic profile , plus 25 % allowance , eg . 3 time daily medication satisfactory 6 10 hour . Selegiline 5mg twice daily exclude analysis second dose take lunchtime avoid sleep disturbance .</detailed_description>
