	<brief_title>Study Proton Pump Inhibitors ( PPI ) Prevent Strictures After Gastric Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( LYRGB ) show safe effective procedure treatment morbid obesity . However , common early complication LYRGB stricture gastrojejunal ( GJ ) anastomosis , occur 4 % - 27 % patient , usually within third post-operative month . This complication usually present progressive dysphagia lead daily vomit . Endoscopic balloon dilation treatment choice complication , multiple dilation often require provide complete resolution . The etiology GJ anastomotic stricture unknown probably multi-factorial . Some investigator hypothesize ischemia non-ischemia-related excessive scar formation cause stricture . The method construction anastomosis well seem impact , circular staple anastomosis may higher rate stricture linear stapler completely hand-sewn anastomosis . The route Roux limb ( antecolic v retrocolic ) appear affect complication . Several investigator demonstrate little acid production gastric bypass pouch . Despite data , acid secretion hypothesize predominant factor development GJ stricture . This hypothesis support part frequent find ulcer site stricture 55 % patient . The purpose study determine whether suppress acid production administration daily proton pump inhibitor early post-operative period reduce GJ anastomosis stricture rate . PLEASE NOTE : THIS STUDY DOES NOT PROVIDE SURGERY ( APPROPRIATE INSURANCE COVERAGE IS REQUIRED ) .</detailed_description>
