	<brief_summary>Childhood absence epilepsy ( CAE ) form generalize epilepsy syndrome . Clinically seizures manifest sudden , brief ( 3-15 second ) loss awareness follow quick recovery baseline . Keppra ( levetiracetam ) approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat partial seizure adult . It currently study child partial seizure . Absence seizures difficult detect clinically , therefore response therapy determine clinical observation 24 hour EEG recording . The researcher hope information learn well work treatment childhood absence epilepsy dose . This open-label , dose-ranging pilot study levetiracetam subject newly diagnose childhood absence epilepsy . Approximately 20 patient need study effectiveness dose requirement . Subjects must antiepileptic medication time entry study . Male female subject age 4 10 year age may participate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Efficacy Tolerability Levetiracetam Monotherapy Subjects With Childhood Absence Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 12 week ( 12 week treatment phase ) , dose range pilot study effectiveness levetiracetam treatment childhood absence epilepsy . It consist 1 phase . The treatment phase optimal medication dose define . Absence seizure often brief subtle postictal manifestation . As result , clinical observation alone inadequate assess seizure Therefore , subjective clinical response ( parental/caregiver assessment ) EEG recording important part evaluation treatment response . A 6 hour outpatient video-EEG study ( include 3 minute hyperventilation ) , follow 18 hour ambulatory EEG record - total 24 hour EEG record do treatment every 2 week dose plateau reach )</detailed_description>
