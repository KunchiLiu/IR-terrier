	<brief_summary>Introduction Temporal arteritis ( TA ) common primary vasculitis adult population . TA systemic multi-organ disease primarily involve cranial artery , especially temporal artery . The sign symptom disease variable therefore differential diagnosis often difficult . The annual incidence disease population age 50 Jerusalem 10 per 100,000 . Diagnosis base clinical finding confirm biopsy temporal artery , positive histologic finding arteritis . Though biopsy procedure minor accomplish local anesthesia , without morbidity . Along minor pain , serious complication - facial nerve injury , ptosis , stroke , local necrosis skin - report . A negative biopsy completely rule diagnosis TA segmental nature inflammation . Even one remove appropriate length artery ( usually 1-2 cm ) possibility exist involve segment may include biopsy report normal . It recently report color Doppler ultrasonography use diagnose TA . Arterial inflammation cause peri-vascular edema appear `` dark halo '' segmental stenosis temporal artery characteristic ultrasound finding suggestive TA . If dark halo sign , diagnosis TA support temporal artery biopsy avoid patient . The presence dark halo sign positive predictive value 50 % . As noted disease characterize segmental involvement artery avoid false negative biopsy , excision 3cm artery recommend , thereby increase morbidity , lead patient refuse procedure . Use ultrasound-guided biopsy artery may dramatically raise sensitivity specificity biopsy reduce requirement excise long segment artery . Objective The objective study examine use ultrasound-guided biopsy temporal artery diagnosis TA . Ultrasound-guided biopsy compare standard random biopsy generally use . Appropriate statistical method employ . Methods The Vascular Laboratory Shaare Zedek Medical Center perform approximately 200 Doppler ultrasound study temporal artery year request community-based physician . Some patient also refer biopsy temporal artery various surgical facility city . In collaboration refer physician , patient offer combined diagnostic Doppler ultrasound guide biopsy basis clinical guideline accord ultrasound finding describe . Patients suffer sign symptom consistent TA undergone previous temporal artery biopsy include . Patients suffer isolated polymyalgia rheumatica exclude . Patients already undergo steroid treatment exclude . Patients ultrasound study positive dark halo sign divide two group random basis obtain informed consent . One group undergo ultrasound-guided biopsy , undergo biopsy standard practice institution - 1-2cm length temporal artery excise preauricular area . If ultrasound negative , biopsy do set study . It expect 50 patient accrue 6-month study period . Differences outcome analyzed use Fishers exact test . Approval Helsinki committee Shaare Zedek Medical Center request .</brief_summary>
