	<detailed_description>Currently , many Americans suffer asthma . The exact mechanism airway inflammation lead asthma symptoms yet clearly explain . In previous study , person asthma appear different type inflammation lung . The reason difference remain mystery . Allergy known play role bronchospasm . Other mechanism discover . It known asthma heartburn correlate . Studies confirm direct relationship cough heartburn ( Gastroesophageal reflux ) . Other researcher determine asthma often worsened GER . Determination exact relationship two entity remain unclear . Heartburn may contribute airway inflammation asthmatic , result different pattern inflammation people without GER . In fact , adult-onset asthma may result primarily longstanding heartburn . This yet prove . This study evaluate heartburn may lead different type inflammation one 's airway . Additionally , goal study determine whether aggressive treatment heartburn result improvement symptom heartburn asthma also document improvement airway inflammation determine biopsy . The result study important directing future research relationship heartburn asthma may provide clue whether certain subtypes asthma may cause primarily GER . A total 30 subject study , randomized twice daily lansoprazole placebo . Study procedures follow : A. Esophageal study validate questionnaire : Patients evaluate validated SF-36 Quality Life Questionnaire , Mini-asthma Quality Life Questionnaire , GER Questionnaire . Patients undergo esophageal manometry pH detection 24- hour pH probe confirm presence pathologic GER . B. Bronchoscopy : After overnight fast , subject report bronchoscopy suite direct . Bronchoscopy bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) bronchial biopsy perform follow University Utah 's standardized protocol . Bronchoscopy endobronchial biopsy present minimal risk asthmatic airway perform appropriate , trained personnel . Conscious sedation intravenous remifentanyl propofol administer trained nurse experience conscious sedation . The nose pharynx anesthetize 1 % lidocaine administer nebulization lidocaine jelly administer topically nasal mucosa . Additional lidocaine administer via bronchoscope vocal cord , trachea , main carina mainstem bronchus . The total dose lidocaine exceed 400 mg. All subject continuous cardiac oxygen saturation monitor receive supplemental oxygen procedure sufficient maintain SpO2 &gt; 90 % . The subject place recumbent position bronchoscope introduce via nose . After pass vocal cord , bronchoscope introduce via right mainstem bronchus right middle lobe wedge segmental bronchus . ( Should , reason , right middle lobe inaccessible , procedure use wedge bronchoscope lingular segment leave lung . ) A 60 cc aliquot room temperature normal saline instill bronchoscope recover use syringe . This procedure repeat three time ( total lavage volume 240 cc ) recover volume pool measure . Forceps biopsies respiratory mucosa take trachea , main carina , bronchus intermedius right middle lobe area . Two six biopsy take site . Specific tissue site frozen store future use . Individuals randomize lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily placebo ( patient undergo lifestyle modification reflux ) 6 week . It determine previous study higher level acid suppression need result clinical improvement asthma . Patients monitor telephone regular interval . Rescue inhaler use , hospitalization , exercise tolerance , study compliance assess record document clinical progress . Patients ask maintain standard inhaler therapy ( especially inhale steroid ) . Any change therapy immediately report investigator . If subject experience acute flare , appropriate medication give patient stable return initial inhaler regimen . If patient remain stable medication throughout trial , repeat bronchoscopy perform 6 week . After 6 week , patient undergo bronchoscopy BAL/biopsies . Cytokine protein array repeat . Comparisons make intra-group therapy . Additional comparison inflammation bronchial hyper-responsiveness make group . Randomization allow investigator control change cytokine pattern due seasonal affect ( group reduce concentration Interleukin-5 similar pattern , likely seasonal due acid suppression ) . Primary outcome include change cellular infiltration bronch specimens lymphocyte . Secondary outcome include RNA expression change tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha BAL sample .</detailed_description>
