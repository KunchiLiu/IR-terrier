	<brief_summary>Chemotherapy lower white blood cell count weaken immune system long time . This put patient high risk get serious fungal infection internal organ blood . One infection cause mold call Aspergillus life threaten . Usually doctor give preventive antifungal therapy try low risk infection . Despite , patient still risk get fungal infection . This study thus design test Galactomannan - component cell wall Aspergillus hence detect treat fungal infection early .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Determine Whether Galactomannan Test Will Help Detect Fungal Infections Early Hence Start Treatment Early</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis invasive Aspergillosis ( IA ) remain challenge febrile neutropenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) recipient . Recent study show early diagnosis IA possible group high-risk patient . Serial screen circulate Galactomannan ( GM ) , epitopic determinant several antigen secrete Aspergillus early growth , show sensitive specific diagnosis IA . This test may help u detect IA early , thereby permit pre-emptive strategy initiate high-risk patient . In prospective , randomize , non-blinded study , seek compare outcome novel GM-guided anti-fungal strategy conventional empirical antifungal therapy . Patients randomized conventional arm undergo serial GM monitoring , receive standard anti-fungal prophylaxis standard empirical antifungal therapy accordance publish guideline . Patients randomize GM arm receive standard anti-fungal prophylaxis receive empiric anti-fungal therapy unless 2 GM reading positive . The study aim determine strategy permit target , pre-emptive therapy great risk , spare febrile patient without evidence fungal infection prolong fever unnecessary potentially toxic therapy . It also aim determine GM guide pre-emptive antifungal therapy use Amphotericin-B deoxycholate prevents development proven probable invasive aspergillosis ( IA ) . The study also prospectively evaluate ( blinded fashion ) use realtime polymerase chain reaction ( RT PCR ) assay cohort patient receive GM serial monitoring , investigate role diagnosis treatment monitor invasive Aspergillosis .</detailed_description>
