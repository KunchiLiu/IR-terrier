	<brief_summary>Certain type cell locate bone marrow may help body recover injury . These cell may able help body repair heart muscle damage heart attack . NX-CP105 new investigational drug make special type bone marrow cell , come another person . NX-CP105 approve sale general use Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , study first time NX-CP105 give human being . This study conduct see side effect associate NX-CP105 whether NX-CP105 may help body repair heart muscle damage heart attack . Three different dos NX CP105 test study , start low dose first . Patients decide participate study heart catheterization procedure narrow tube insert artery ( type blood vessel ) groin pass heart . A second narrow tube insert vein ( type blood vessel ) groin pass heart . A device pass second tube . This device use inject NX-CP105 cell directly heart muscle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Bone Marrow Derived Cells Treat Damaged Heart Muscle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient go three phase study . The first screening/baseline phase , second treatment phase , third follow-up phase . - The procedure require SCREENING/BASELINE PERIOD do doctor 's office outside hospital . - Patients ask past medical condition medicine take . - Patients ask often get chest pain . - Patients complete physical examination . - Patient vital sign ( temperature , blood pressure , pulse breathe rate ) weight measure . - Patients give blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine routine laboratory test , see infected certain virus ( HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , CMV ) test determine blood type . A pregnancy test do patient capable get pregnant . - Patients electrocardiogram ( ECG - painless heart beat trace ) . - Patients ask walk fast six minute . - Patients x-ray type test call nuclear scan ( SPECT ) heart . A small amount radioactive material inject vein test , allow doctor evaluate blood flow heart . - Patients echocardiogram , procedure use sound wave look position , size , movement heart valves heart wall , well direction blood flow within heart chamber . A solution improve ability echocardiogram device look heart inject vein part procedure . - Patients ask wear Holter monitor ( small ECG machine ) 24 hour wear around neck Velcro pouch shirt pocket . The monitor attach chest three small adhesive patch use collect heart beat information . Patients take patch 24 hour return monitor study doctor . - During TREATMENT PERIOD patient keep hospital least 3 day receive new investigational drug ( NX-CP105 ) . - Patients need admitted hospital day thet receive study drug ( bone marrow cell ) . During time patient procedure call cardiac catheterization . The study doctor make small puncture groin area numb local anesthetic ( similar Novocaine use dentist ) . Two thin catheter ( tube ) place groin area , one vein one artery ( large blood vessel ) . Blood thinner give procedure help prevent blood clot . A series thinner tube ( catheter ) insert first tube carefully push heart chamber . These catheter use produce 3-dimensional color map ( NOGA ) show heart damage . When map complete , catheter take new device needle tip run tube . Using map heart , doctor inject NX CP105 part heart look like damage . - After NX-CP105 inject , tube remove . After procedure , patient another echocardiogram look heart problem may happen procedure . Patients admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) least 24 hour . Patients remain hospital least 72 hour ( 3 day ) receive NX-CP105 . - Before leave hospital , patient another physical examination , include vital sign measurement ECGs . Blood urine laboratory safety sample collect - The FOLLOW-UP PERIOD last 12 month . Patients ask return study doctor regular visit Day 7 , Day 14 , Day 21 , 2 month , 3 month , 6 month 12 month receive NX CP105 . At study visit , patient ask following thing : - Answer question symptom since last study visit , include chest pain . - Have physical examination . - Have vital sign measure . - Give blood routine laboratory test . - Have ECG . - Wear Holter Monitor 24 hour ( except 6 12 month visit ) . - Have six minute walk test ( 3 6 month visit ) . - Have nuclear scan ( SPECT ) heart ( 3 6 month visit ) . - Have echocardiogram ( 3 6 month visit ) . - Patients also admit hospital another cardiac catheterization NOGA mapping procedure come back 3 month follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
