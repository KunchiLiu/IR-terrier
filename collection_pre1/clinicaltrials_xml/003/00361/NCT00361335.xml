	<brief_title>A Study Safety Effectiveness Golimumab Participants With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Despite Methotrexate Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , double blind ( neither investigator participant know treatment receive ) , placebo-controlled ( inactive substance compare study medication test whether study medication real effect clinical study ) , multicenter , 5-arm ( treatment group ) study golimumab 2 dos ( give without MTX period 30 minute ) least 48 week patient active RA despite concurrent MTX therapy . The study consist treatment period golimumab IV infusion ( IV Period ) range 48 week approximately 140 week , assume enrollment period approximately 92 week , long-term optional extension period ( Extension Study ) golimumab SC injection give 24 week . The end study time last participant completes Week E-40 visit ( Extension Study ) safety follow-up assessment . For IV Period , participant randomly assign 1 5 treatment group 1:1:1:1:1 ratio ( approximately 125 patient per group ) . At Week 16 Week 24 , joint assessment result use allow participant enter early escape dose regimen adjustment , respectively , blind fashion . Treatment unblinded 48-week database lock participant give option participate Extension Study receive SC injection 50mg golimumab ( without MTX ) every 4 week additional 24 week . Safety monitor throughout study . The entire study duration ( IV Period plus Extension Study ) participant range 88 week 192 week , assume enrollment period approximately 92 week .</detailed_description>
