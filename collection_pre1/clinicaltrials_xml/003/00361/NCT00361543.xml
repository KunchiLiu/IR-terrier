	<brief_summary>The aim project investigate use Raloxifene ( new form estrogen ) treatment woman schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . Raloxifene Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator ( SERM ) , mean affect central nervous system ( CNS ) effect estrogen ( eg . improve emotional symptom , memory , information processing concentration ) , without adversely affect reproductive tissue/organs breast , uterus ovary . The investigator conduct double-blind , placebo control , three month study compare psychotic symptom response woman schizophrenia group . One group receive standard antipsychotic medication plus 120mg Raloxifene , second group receive standard antipsychotic medication plus oral placebo . Hypothesis 1 : That woman receive adjunctive Raloxifene would quicker recovery psychotic symptom , measure rating scale , compare woman receive adjunctive placebo . Hypothesis 2 : That Raloxifene group would well cognitive improvement placebo group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Estrogen hypothesise protective woman early onset severe symptom schizophrenia ( Hafner , 1991 ; Seeman , 1992 ) . This 'estrogen hypothesis ' derive epidemiological , clinical animal study . Following result study , investigator conduct study ( Kulkarni et al 1996 ) group premenopausal woman schizophrenia give 0.02mg oral estradiol adjunct antipsychotic drug treatment eight week , compare progress similar group receive antipsychotic drug . The group receive estrogen make significantly rapid recovery acute psychotic symptom also report improvement general health status . Subsequently , investigator conduct four week double-blind , placebo-controlled study , use 100mcg estradiol skin patch . The investigator find 12 premenopausal woman receive estradiol adjunct significantly low total PANSS BPRS score 12 woman receive placebo patch plus antipsychotic medication . The major potential risk use estrogen long term adjunctive treatment premenopausal woman schizophrenia appear potential harmful effect estrogen action breast uterine tissue . Our study brief reason , investigator use estrogen without progesterone eight week four week period . With recent advent Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators , particular Raloxifene Hydrochloride , potential harness positive estrogenic effect CNS neurotransmitter system without affect breast uterine tissue . While CNS effect Raloxifene fully study , action mediate bind estrogen receptor thereby regulate gene expression ligand , tissue gene specific . By inference , Raloxifene would expect impact dopamine serotonin pathways similar fashion conjugate estrogen . A study ( Nickleisen et al 1999 ) effect Raloxifene cognition healthy , postmenopausal woman find slight increase verbal memory performance one month high dose treatment , difference find 12 month treatment . There study woman cognitive impairment treatment effect would likely apparent . Similarly , clinical study date investigate effect Raloxifene psychotic symptom . To end , investigator put forward investigator initiate clinical trial proposal investigate effect adjunctive Raloxifene psychotic symptom woman schizophrenia . This , therefore , study follow Pilot Study area , increase Raloxifene 60mg 120mg daily . The aim project study effect Raloxifene adjunct antipsychotic medication woman schizophrenia mean develop novel , safe adjunctive treatment woman schizophrenia improve quality life .</detailed_description>
