	<detailed_description>We study patient severe burn , define 2nd 3rd degree burn cover &gt; 40 % total body surface area ( TBSA ) . We propose study burn child Shriners Burns Hospital . The Shriners census approximately 50 child severe burn treat every year . We study patient immediately prior third surgical procedure , approximately 12-15 day injury . One half patient give fenofibrate ( 5 mg/kg/day ) daily deliver feed tube time consent follow admission 12-14 day post-burn . This length time injury ensure untreated patient large accumulation hepatic TG . Because `` control '' group patient elevate liver TGs , `` experimental '' group hepatic TGs lower fenofibrate . By study patient day operation , possible remove staple use skin graft without risk loss adhesion graph , thereby ensure safety MRS. Femoral line insert surgery also utilized , patient generally receive full transfusion surgery , minimize study relate blood loss . In addition liver , study muscle burn patient . Patients studied brief fast state . The fasted four hour prior study study . Their TPN immediately reconnected follow study . The surgical team Shrine place 3Fr , 8 cm polyethylene catheter ( Cook , Inc. , Bloomington , IN ) femoral vein femoral artery local anesthesia day surgery . Both femoral catheter use blood sampling , femoral arterial catheter also use indocyanine green infusion determination leg blood flow . Systemic concentration indocyanine green measure central vein , standard procedure multi-lumen subclavian line patient . Patency catheter maintain saline infusion . Patients infused stable ( non-radioactive ) isotope tracer glucose , phenylalanine palmitate 8 hour . After 4 hour , without interruption tracer infusion , infusion insulin start maintain rate 1.5 mU/kg•min final 4 h. Blood glucose concentration measure throughout insulin infusion glucose infuse necessary maintain basal plasma glucose concentration . A biopsy quadriceps obtain Bergstrom needle beginning study , 4 h ( immediately insulin infusion ) end 4 h insulin infusion . We use A-V balance technique address relation tissue fatty acid TG metabolism insulin responsiveness glucose uptake myofibrillar mitochondrial protein synthesis net protein balance . b . Subjects Patients admitted burn unit within 48 h injury . Fluid resuscitation provide previously describe ( 94 ) . Within 48 h admission , burn wound excise subsequently graft autograft cadaveric allograft . Patients typically return operate room reharvesting donor site every five seven day . The experiment propose perform day prior third surgery day 12-15 , femoral catheter normally inserted time access surgery . Enteral feed Vivonex TEN ( Sandoz Nutrition Corp , Minneapolis , MN ) start within 24h admission continue patient capable food mouth . All patient eligible study unless one exclusion criterion list apply . c. Procedures From day 1 day 22 patient maintain enteral feeding high carbohydrate/amino acid mixture ( Vivonex , Novartis , Minneapolis , MN ) . Vivonex contain 300 kcal/serving follow caloric breakdown : 82.3 % carbohydrate , 15 % protein , 2.7 % fat ( linoleic acid ) . Patients give 25 kcal/kg Vivonex plus additional 45 kcal/kg percentage point total body surface area burn . One half patient give fenofibrate ( 5 mg/kg/day - maximum daily dose ) time first tracer study time second tracer study . The tracer study subject commence catheter femoral artery vein place surgical team , necessary , since majority patient wil pre-existing line place clinical reason . The catheter use sample peripheral vein infusing , previous study ( e.g. , 4 ) . Enteral administration mixture carbohydrate amino acid ( Vivonex ) stop four hour prior study , start immediately follow study . On day tracer infusion amount liver muscle TG liver glycogen determine MRS. After metal staple remove , patient transport clinical MRS facility UTMB Dept . Radiology , measurement perform ( see detail ) , After obtain baseline sample , tracer infusion start described Figure 2 . Half patient high tissue TG give nicotinic acid ( 500 mg orally ) start period 2 low FFA level acutely . In group give fenofibrate ( 200 mg/d ) propranolol 0.5mg/kg every 6 hour low FFA , half infused heparin ( 0.5 U/kg•min , 2.8 U/ kg prime IV ) dose sufficient activate lipoprotein lipase , thereby elevate plasma FFA , affect blood coagulation . After baseline blood sample femoral artery , femoral vein , peripheral vein collect , 8 hour continuous infusion primed-constant infusion 6,6-d2-glucose ( 0.08 mg/kg•min , prime = 6.8 mg/kg ) d5-phenylalanine ( 0.20 µmol/kg•min , prime = 8.0 µmol/kg ) give order quantify hepatic glucose production protein synthetic rate , respectively . In addition , 2 hour protocol , U-13C16-palmitate ( 0.16 µmol/kg per minute ) start NaH13CO3 prime ( 150 µmol/kg ) order quantify hepatic fatty acid uptake oxidation . These tracer infusion also maintain throughout 8 hour tracer study . Blood sample ( 2- 12 ml ) take artery , femoral vein peripheral vein simultaneously 120 , 180 , 210 , 225 240 minute ( see Appendix 2 full timeline ) . Muscle tissue biopsy obtain start period 1 , 4 hour period 1 measure protein kinetics also determine biochemical parameter . Then , period 2 start . At start period 2 , prim , constant infusion 15N-phenylalanine start maintain throughout period 2 . The different tracer phenylalanine use quantify plasma protein synthetic rate use tracer protocol period 1 . We previously show two phenylalanine tracer yield result ( 70 ) . The tracer technique enable u measure primary endpoint insulin responsiveness liver , i.e. , endogenous glucose production synthetic rate albumin fibrinogen . At 4 hour , hyperinsulinemia initiate infusion insulin rate 1.5 mu/kg•min , result circulating level approximately 200 uU/ml ( 5 ) . This rate infusion base previous experience insulin infusion burn patient ( e.g. , 1-5 ) . We anticipate considerable variation baseline insulin concentration , low rate infusion use , result `` hyperinsulinemia '' patient would likely baseline concentration others . Consequently , choose rate infusion result clear-cut difference baseline `` hyperinsulinemic '' value . Further , although insulin infusion anticipate insulin concentration also variable , endpoint assess term magnitude change baseline value subject . This statistical approach minimize concern regard subject variability . The dosage select previously show protein metabolism responsive rate infusion ( 5 ) , maximally-effective dose ( 4 ) . Blood glucose concentration monitor throughout second period , glucose infuse ( necessary ) maintain glucose concentration baseline level . Since baseline concentration glucose vary , mean hyperinsulinemia glucose concentration likely differ subject , select approach way insulin concentration differ period 1 2 , thereby simplify interpretation change substrate protein kinetics period 1 2 . The sampling schedule period 1 , include time biopsy ( i.e. , 4 h period 2 ) . Leg blood flow measure indocyanine green infusion , ad describe previously ( 14 ) . Whole-body indirect calorimetry perform quantify whole-body carbohydrate fat oxidation .</detailed_description>
