	<brief_summary>Intermittent Preventive Treatment malaria infant promise strategy reduce incidence clinical malaria child age 1 year . It likely implement malaria control strategy Tanzania use sulfadoxine/pyremethamine SP . SP fail first line treatment clinical episode malaria government policy drive change use Artemesin Combination Therapy ( ACT ) . The main ongoing Kilimanjaro IPTi study look alternative SP use IPTi . Currently , evidence use drug IPT , SP continue IPT pregnancy infant . This study propose measure efficacy SP chlorproguanil/dapsone ( CD ) , symptomatic 6- 59 month old child use standard methodology . These study drug main IPTi study . This help u see efficacy SP CD sick child relate efficacy treat asymptomatic child IPTi . In addition proposal aim test efficacy SP give 2-10 month old asymptomatic infant ( target group IPTi ) . Evidence suggest asymptomatic malaria infection low parasitaemia high cure rate symptomatic infection high parasitaemia even marker resistance highly prevalent . This second study aim quantify difference produce evidence help policy maker know drug use IPTi change . Both study open label run concurrently Hale , Korogwe district near main Kilimanjaro IPTi site Tanzania .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Rational This part multicentre trial look antimalarial resistance within series Intermittent Preventive Treatment malaria Infants ( IPTi ) study . IPTi promise intervention reduce malaria infant malaria endemic country . 3 dos antimalarial drug give first year life asymptomatic infant time 2nd 3rd Diptheria , Tetanus Pertusus immunisation 9 month age time measles immunisation . In current Kilimanjaro IPTi study compare 3 antimalarial ( Mefloquine MQ , sulfadoxine/pyremethamine SP chlorproguanil/dapsone CD ) placebo IPTi 2 transmission zone . Two published study use SP IPTi show different efficacy intervention . The first study ( Schellenberg et al 2001 ) show 62 % reduction clinical case malaria second ( Chandramohan et al , 2005 ) show 25 % reduction clinical case malaria . The two site differ several way , first carry area moderate low transmission moderate rate SP resistance Tanzania latter carry area intense seasonal malaria low rate SP resistance Ghana . The current IPTi study carry site high transmission expect high rate SP resistance . Data site 100km away indicate SP efficacy 55 % ( Mutabingwa et al , 2001 ) . There data SP study drug ongoing study site . In addition evidence ( Personal communication Chandramohan 2005 ) outcome ( Adequate Parasite Response ( APR ) ) asymptomatic parasitaemia infant well symptomatic 6-59 month old child use SP . For reason plan novel study examine efficacy SP asymptomatic 2-10 month old infant , target age group IPTi . The main objective component drug resistance study understand relationship efficacy antimalarial drug use IPTi long term effect IPTi incidence clinical malaria . Schellenberg et al ( 2005 ) . observe 36 % reduction incidence clinical malaria second year life SP IPTi group compare placebo group even though last course SP IPTi give 9 month age ( Schellenberg et al , 2005 ) . This suggest SP IPTi area moderate malaria transmission moderate level resistance SP ( +/-25 % ) IPTi may enhance development immunity malaria . In contrast , study Ghana area high seasonal malaria transmission low resistance SP ( &lt; 10 % ) show 20 % increase incidence clinical malaria high parasite density ( &gt; 5000 parasites/ml ) SP IPTi group compare placebo group . The nature relationship drug resistance long term effect IPTi malaria remain unclear . Parasite clearance rate depend efficacy antimalarial drug host immunity . Host immunity depend age - immunity infant likely low immunity 1-4 year old child . Parasite clearance rate depend parasite density , multiplicity infection , type host response - factor differ clinical episode malaria asymptomatic parasitaemia . The interaction antimalarial drug host response clinical episode malaria likely different asymptomatic malaria parasitaemia . Although infant mild illness exclude IPTi administration routine EPI clinic , majority infant asymptomatic receive IPTi . Thus result standard WHO vivo drug sensitivity study conduct 6-59 month-old symptomatic child unlikely applicable 2-10 month old mostly asymptomatic infant receive IPTi . However , empirical evidence support refute assertion . In order understand relationship level drug resistance long term effect IPTi , exact level drug resistance IPTi target infant need establish related IPTi efficacy . Thus modify WHO vivo drug resistance study 2-10 month old asymptomatic infant need conduct part Kilimanjaro IPTi study comparison make efficacy SP estimate standard WHO 6-59 month WHO vivo efficacy study . Objectives We therefore propose 2 study follow objective : 1 . Enumerate drug efficacy SP CD study area use standard WHO vivo drug efficacy methodology symptomatic child age 6-59 month , 2 . Enumerate efficacy SP asymptomatic 2-10 month old use modify WHO vivo drug efficacy methodology , target population IPTi 3 . Determine difference efficacy use SP different indication , ie use symptomatic asymptomatic child . Methods Study 1 standard vivo WHO drug efficacy study look parasite positive symptomatic child age 6 59 month treat SP CD . They follow 1,2 3 , 7,14,21 28 day . At visit blood slide filter paper collect . Endpoints day 28 recrudescence rate . Study 2 modify vivo drug efficacy study age group directly affect IPTi , namely 2-10 month age . Asymptomatic child follow day 1 , 2 , 3,7,14 , 21 28 . Endpoint day 28 recrudescence rate . Blood slide filter paper take day 7 , 14 28 unless child fever report fever last 48 hour . Sample size study subject Table 1 Study Arm Expected ( assume ) rate adequate parasitological response day 28 ( APR ) Acceptable 95 % confidence limit ( precision ) Sample Size need base expect APR acceptable precision Total sample size ( correct assume 10 % loss follow-up 10 % nonadherence ) 6-59 month symptomatic child SP 60 % +/-6 % 292* 330 CD 805 +/-7.5 % 131 145 2-10 month asymptomatic child SP 75 % +/-7.5 % 146* 161 *SP study number calculate detect 15 % difference APR day 28 symptomatic 6-59 month old child asymptomatic 2-10 month old child 80 % power 5 % significance level use ratio 2 symptomatic case 1 asymptomatic case . Children attend single health dispensary ( Hale dispensary , Korogwe District , Tanga Region , Tanzania ) age 6-59 month fever history fever within precede 48 hour ask take part . If fit entry criterion ( see attach protocol ) consent , enrol standard WHO vivo efficacy study . Asymptomatic child age 2 10 month attend MCH clinic immunisation weigh invited take part 2-10 month efficacy study eligible study consent enrol study . Study Site The project take place Hale Dispensary , government dispensary offering primary care MCH service population 8,000 , average 30 new birth month . Hale situate Korogwe district , Tanga region , northeastern Tanzania lowland high malaria transmission . It less 10 km IPTi study site . Ethical consideration It expect first line antimalarial drug policy change November 2006 SP lumefantrine/arthemeter . After date ethical continue 6-59 month study symptomatic child . However asymptomatic child ethical continue SP use continue asymptomatic woman IPTp adopt strategy Tanzania , SP use IPTi . Therefore plan carry SP efficacy 6-59 month study symptomatic child soon possible national policy change completion study halt . The 2-10 month old asymptomatic study run concurrently completion . In study second line drug lumefantrine/arthemeter child treatment fail . Clinical safety subject paramount . We encourage mother bring child review follow period ever child sick . We budget transport allowance mother help make journey necessary . We ensure 24 hour access member study team time . This person able call medical staff cover clinical trial activity Korogwe District Hospital advice possible emergency transfer hospital assessment . An emergency vehicle standby 24 hour day .</detailed_description>
