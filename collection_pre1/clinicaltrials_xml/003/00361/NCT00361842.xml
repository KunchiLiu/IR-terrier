	<brief_title>Multicenter Study Of CPX-1 ( Irinotecan HCl : Floxuridine ) Liposome Injection In Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CPX-1 Liposome Injection liposomal formulation fix combination antineoplastic drug irinotecan HCl floxuridine . The two drug present inside liposome fix 1:1 molar ratio . CPX-1 develop mean deliver preserve fix 1:1 molar ratio two drug . This ratio find vitro vivo model cancer synergistic anti-cancer activity preservation delivery ratio important ratio two drug find antagonistic additive . Both floxuridine irinotecan HCl active chemotherapeutic agent , approve clinical use United States Canada colorectal cancer . Current practice routinely administer 5- fluorouracil irinotecan combination regimen first second line treatment without mean preserve synergistic ratio .</detailed_description>
