	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause irreversible blindness develop country throughout world.The beneficial therapeutic effect Photodynamic Therapy ( PDT ) treatment AMD modest . The treatment benefit PDT may moderate PDT-induced , non-selective effect choroidal circulation ( result hypoxia-induced stimulation angiogenesis increase vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) production ) , direct injury retinal pigment epithelium , subretinal fluid/hemorrhage post-treatment inflammation secondary PDT . There potential supplemental Avastin ( VEGF inhibition ) intravitreal Triamcinolone Acetonide ( ITA ) treatment ( non-specific membrane stabilizing , anti-neovascular , anti-inflammatory activity ) could minimize effect process , enhance efficacy PDT . Presently , PDT , current gold standard , combination Avastin and/or Kenalog widely use exactly fashion may become standard care without necessary randomize clinical trial . However , treatment benefit intervention uncertain safety profile . This randomize , control trial address potential supplemental therapeutic effect intravitreal injection Triamcinolone Acetonide and/or Avastin conjunction photodynamic therapy treatment sub-foveal CNVM secondary AMD .</detailed_description>
