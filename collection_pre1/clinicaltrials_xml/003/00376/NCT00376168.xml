	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease , prevalent lysosomal storage disorder , cause mutation human glucocerebrosidase gene ( GCD ) lead reduce activity lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase thereby accumulation substrate glucocerebroside ( GlcCer ) cell monocyte-macrophage system . This second trial utilize recombinant active form lysosomal enzyme , glucocerebrosidase , ( human prGCD ) express purify bioreactor system transform carrot plant root cell line .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase III Trial Assess Safety Efficacy Plant Cell Expressed GCD Patients With Gaucher Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , randomize , double-blind , parallel group , dose-ranging trial ass safety efficacy prGCD 30 untreated patient Gaucher disease .
