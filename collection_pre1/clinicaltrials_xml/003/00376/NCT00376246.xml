	<brief_title>Effect Ezetimibe Flow-Mediated Brachial Artery Reactivity Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>24 subject recruit . Exclusion criterion presence know metabolic syndrome well history coronary artery disease , hypertension , diabetes , cardiomyopathy tobacco use . Study conduct double blind placebo control crossover trial . Subjects randomize 2 group . 1st group receive Ezetimibe 2 week follow washout ( medication ) period 4 week follow placebo 2 week . 2nd group receive Ezetimibe placebo reverse order interspaced 4-week washout period . Each subject evaluate 2 visit end intervention period ( Ezetimibe placebo ) . Visits occur 2 8 week enrollment . Subjects ask fast 12 hrs visit . During visit , subject undergo brachial artery reactivity study ( BART ) consumption standardize high cholesterol meal 3 6-hour point meal . The standardized high cholesterol meal consist 2 Egg McMuffin® sandwich . This meal weigh 276 g contains 34g protein , 60g carbohydrate , 22g total fat 470 mg cholesterol 290 Calories . Subjects also blood draw serum lipid measurement perform BART procedure ( total 3 BART 3 blood sample collection per patient per visit ) . Brachial artery reactivity study conduct per follow protocol : - Equipment - Echocardiography system w/vascular software 2-D imaging , Doppler high-frequency vascular transducer . - Initial image - Subject place temperature-controlled room ( 22Cº ) . With subject position supine , leave brachial artery image 5 cm antecubital crease longitudinal plane twice . Blood pressure heart rate also measure . - FMD - 12.5 cm blood pressure cuff place antecubital fossa leave arm , baseline flow velocity obtain pulsed Doppler . Thereafter , artery occlude cuff inflation 50 mm Hg systolic pressure 5 minute subsequently deflate . The longitudinal image obtain 1 min cuff release . - FMD w/NTG - 10 min baseline study , FMD NTG obtain . 0.4 mg sublingual NTG tablet give subject 4 min later , FMD image repeat described . - Analysis - Photographic image end-diastolic frame obtain . Images analyze 2 independent investigator blind subject 's identity temporal sequence image . Arterial diameter brachial artery longitudinal plane image clear visualization anterior posterior intimal/lumen interface determine caliper measurement . FMD quantify percent diameter change post-occlusion arterial diameter measurement relative mean 2 correspond baseline measurement . Similar analysis perform FMD follow administration NTG . Lipid test perform use VAP® test include VLDL , LDL , HDL IDL lipoprotein fraction well Triglycerides , Lipoprotein A , CRP Homocysteine . Statistical analysis conduct follow : group value percent change arterial diameter express mean +/- SD . 2- tailed pair t-test used compare change individual subject . Two-tailed non-paired t-test use compare value group . The analysis FMD - lipid lower correlation perform use paired test parametrically distribute data Wilcoxon matched-pair sign rank test nonparametrically distribute data compare baseline data change variable end study within group . The test use compare baseline characteristic receive ezetimibe receive placebo group . Correlation variable test use univariate multitivariate analysis . The result present mean ± SD andmedian ( 25-75 percentile ) .</detailed_description>
