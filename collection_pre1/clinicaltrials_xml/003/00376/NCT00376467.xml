	<brief_summary>This proposal , develop framework GIMEMA , permit : - evaluate activity toxicity imatinib treatment Ph+ acute lymphoblastic leukemia ; - evaluate molecular response treatment , monitor molecular status remission case achieve molecular response . The GIMEMA activate network centralize biological sample ( bone marrow peripheral blood ) diagnosis new ALL patient . This permit identify , particular , Ph + and/or BCR/ABL + case within 5 day diagnosis , thus permit treat patient accord different program basis presence Ph chromosome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Imatinib show specific activity ABL protein- tyrosine kinase vitro vivo level . The compound exert direct inhibition proliferation BCR/ABL+ve cell , cell line derive ALL CML patient , induce apoptosis . Induction apoptosis imatinib observe also primary sample leukemic cell obtain Ph+ve ALL patient . Since activate BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase present nearly patient CML 25-30 % ALL , two disease ideal target verify potential therapeutic activity ABL specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor . So far limited experience therapeutic benefit imatinib ALL patient refer . In one study , 10 treat patient receive prior chemotherapeutic treatment leukemia . Imatinib administer daily oral therapy patient treat outpatient basis . Different dosage test : 300 , 400 , 500 mg/day 28 day . Some respond patient show prolonged myelosuppression , minority require hospitalization , side effect appear acceptable . Although result demonstrate Imatinib , single agent , active BCR/ABL +ve ALL , able induce high response rate , however response appear short . This occur mainly patient advance leukemia , thus could hypothesize early relapse , patient , may due pre-existing resistance develop resistance Imatinib . In vitro study well limited preclinical experience show enhanced antileukemic effect Imatinib combination cytotoxic drug , thus clinical trial aim ascertain , mainly previously untreated patient , optimal dosage best duration treatment maximal therapeutic benefit test agent , combine conventional chemotherapy , could really enhance antileukemic activity . The Gimema Group run two distinct study among protocol verify antileukemic activity safety imatinib Ph+ve and/or BCR/ABL +ve ALL : Study A : Imatinib post-consolidation therapy adult ( &gt; =18 &lt; =60 yr ) ALL patient 1st CHR ; Study B : Imatinib without chemotherapy remission induction elderly ( &gt; 60 year ) ALL patient . This proposal , develop framework GIMEMA , include : 1. centralization biological sample ( bone marrow peripheral blood ) diagnosis new ALL patient , identify , particular , Ph + and/or BCR/ABL + case ; 2. evaluation molecular response treatment , monitor molecular status hematological remission case CR ; 3. treatment adult patient induction consolidation treatment already use past GIMEMA Ph+ ALL , also possibility historical control versus patient treat `` imatinib era '' . Study A : Imatinib Ph +ve and/or BCR/ABL +ve adult ( age &lt; 60 year ) ALL patient first CHR induction consolidation treatment . Aimed verify activity safety STI 571 administer induction consolidation therapy Ph+ve and/or Bcr/Abl+ve ALL patient 1st CHR ( +CMR ) . A cohort 38 patient enrol . All Gimema Centers join study . Quantitative Rt-PCR assay mandatory start Imatinib treatment . Patients receive out-patients basis Imatinib p.o . dosage 400 mg x 2/daily 6 month . After complete 6-months therapy , absence safety concern , patient may receive additional therapy Imatinib , provide , opinion investigator , patient benefit treatment . Study B : Imatinib induction treatment newly diagnose Ph+ and/or Bcr/Abl+ elderly ( age &gt; 60 year ) ALL patient . Aimed verify activity safety Imatinib combine steroid induction phase elderly ( &gt; 60 year ) Ph+ve and/or Bcr/Abl+ve ALL patient . A cohort 53 patient enrol . All Gimema Centers join study . The cytogenetic and/or molecular diagnosis must obtain within 5 day diagnosis . Patients receive Imatinib p.o dosage 400 mg x 2/daily 30 day out-patients basis . After complete induction therapy patient may receive additional therapy Imatinib , provide , opinion investigator , patient benefit treatment .</detailed_description>
