	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether patient great loss dopamine transmission due cocaine dependence pre-treatment PET MRI scan fail respond substance abuse treatment . This study also determine whether patient respond treatment experience recovery dopamine function . This study include free brain image behavioral intervention . Compensation provide brain scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Previous study show cocaine dependence associate decrease dopamine release response psychostimulant challenge . We recently complete study demonstrate loss pre-synaptic dopamine function associate choice self-administer cocaine presence alternative reinforcer . This finding consistent animal model reinforcement show dopamine transmission serf modulate reward base behavior , case , allow adaptive response make presence compete reinforcer . The previous study perform non-treatment seek cocaine dependent subject use inpatient laboratory model measure choice cocaine . Thus , goal present proposal investigate association realistic setting cocaine dependent patient face choice use cocaine alternative reinforcer present therapeutic setting . The Community Reinforcement Approach voucher incentive treatment cocaine dependence show success number control study . Since basis therapy reduce reinforce value cocaine increase density alternative , healthy reinforcer , choose correlate outcome treatment measure presynaptic dopamine function . We propose scan cocaine dependent patient [ 11C ] raclopride oral methylphenidate order measure dopamine release . Patients scan treatment 12 week therapy . We predict patient great loss dopamine transmission pre-treatment scan fail respond treatment . Furthermore , hypothesize patient respond treatment experience recovery dopamine function , measure post-treatment scan . In addition , subject enrol study undergo functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) spectroscopy study order ass differences neuronal integrity , learning , impulse control .</detailed_description>
