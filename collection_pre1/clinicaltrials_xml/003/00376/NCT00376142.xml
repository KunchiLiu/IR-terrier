	<brief_title>Translating Clinicians ' Beliefs Into Implementation Interventions ( TRACII )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It consistent find change clinical practice unpredictable slow haphazard process . Over last decade considerable body literature review suggest range intervention ( e.g . reminder system , interactive education ) effective change health care professional ’ behaviour . However , study substantial heterogeneity intervention use , targeted behaviour , study setting make generalising finding routine healthcare setting problematic − underlie generalisable taxonomy either research service setting characterise individual , setting intervention . The assumption clinical practice form human behaviour describe term general theory relate human behaviour offer basis taxonomy Implementation Research . For example , effectiveness intervention may influence factor health professional ’ belief perceive control practice – generalisable concept use across different context . Two step necessary design theory−based intervention behaviour change trial : Step 1 ) The identification modifiable factor underlie professional behaviour order identify process target intervention ( process modelling ) Step 2 ) To gain understanding intervention might work thus optimise ( intervention model ) . Our previous work focus Step 1 . The next step develop intervention change belief base identified theoretical predictor , focus present study . We develop intervention change salient belief distinguish high low intenders , use previously identify GPs salient belief predict intention prescribe antibiotic patient uncomplicated sore throat . Design Theoretical framework : Theory Planned Behaviour Methods : Postal questionnaire survey Clinical behaviour : Prescribing antibiotic uncomplicated sore throat Participants : General Practitioners We develop sample frame list general practitioner supply Primary Care Groups North East England . We sample recruit sufficient general practitioner sample size experiment . Previous work applicant identify salient belief GPs distinguish intend prescribe antibiotic . Based information ( on−going work produce taxonomy clinical behaviour potential psychological behavioural technology ) select develop two intervention design address change discriminative belief prescribe antibiotic sore throat . The intervention evaluate three arm randomise controlled trial embed questionnaire survey , use postal method . The questionnaire package administer two occasion . For administration questionnaire package , two reminder mail non−responding clinician . In light experience response rate previous study plan offer £10 incentive subject increase response rate . Subjects receive letter invitation , study package include : set instruction , individually package set material measure behavioural simulation ( patient scenario ) , behavioural intention process measure ( Questionnaire ) ask read order . On second administration package also contain intervention , GPs ask open prior complete outcome process measure .</detailed_description>
