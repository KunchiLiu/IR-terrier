	<brief_summary>Study purpose The purpose study show addition valsartan top establish therapy reduce recurrence atrial fibrillation patient history recent atrial fibrillation associate cardiovascular diseases/comorbidities . Primary objective To demonstrate , patient history recent atrial fibrillation treat best recommended therapy , addition valsartan 320 mg superior placebo reduce atrial fibrillation recurrence . Study design The GISSI-AF prospective , multicenter , randomize , double blind , placebo control study . Patients history atrial fibrillation centrally randomize 1:1 ratio receive either valsartan placebo . GISSI-AF pragmatic trial , broad selection criterion mimic real clinical practice much possible . Since special examination procedure require trial , economic impact National Health Service minimize use resource likely optimize . The enrollment period last 12 month . The patient follow 12 month study entry All prescribed treatment AF underlie cardiovascular disease , include ACE-inhibitors , amiodarone betablockers , allow : - patient stable treatment least one month - current guideline hypertension treatment apply - patient start ARBs study</brief_summary>
