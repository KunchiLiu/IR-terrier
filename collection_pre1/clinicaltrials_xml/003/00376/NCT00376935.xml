	<brief_title>Effectiveness Palifermin Increasing CD4 Counts Treatment-Experienced HIV Infected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) dramatically improve clinical outcome HIV infect adult ; however , people potent ART experience poor recovery CD4 count despite maximum suppression viral load . Such uncontrolled HIV infection associate reduced ability human body create new T cell ( thymopoiesis ) . HIV infect adult experience reduced thymopoiesis increase risk clinical disease progression . The thymus primary site CD4 cell development ; research suggest keratinocyte growth factor ( KGF ) may enhance thymus activity individual exhibit reduce thymopoiesis . Palifermin modify version naturally occur KGF approve treat people hematologic malignancy . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy palifermin increase CD4 count , enhance thymopoiesis , treatment-experienced HIV infect adult suppress viral load low CD4 count . This study last 24 week . Participants randomly assign one four arm : - Arm A participant receive placebo - Arm B participant receive palifermin 20 mcg/kg - Arm C participant receive palifermin 40 mcg/kg - Arm D participant receive palifermin 60 mcg/kg Participants receive intravenous dos assign intervention Days 1 , 2 , 3 . All participant must remain current ART regimen duration study . ART provide study . There six study visit , occur Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 . All visit include targeted physical exam blood urine collection .</detailed_description>
