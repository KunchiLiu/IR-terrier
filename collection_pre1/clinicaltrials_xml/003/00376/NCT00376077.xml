	<brief_summary>Childhood immune thrombocytopenia purpura ( ITP ) disorder characterize production antibody platelet , result enhance destruction platelet . Most child ITP present low platelet count ( PC ) minimal bleed . Very rarely child may present severe life-threatening bleed , bleed head . In case important PC raise quickly possible . The combination corticosteroid intravenous gammaglobulin ( IVIG ) commonly use management severe bleed child ITP quickly raise PC yet treatment combination test use IVIG alone . If show combination agent result quick rise PC use IVIG alone would support use combination therapy emergency situation . As ethically conduct study patient life-threatening bleeds , plan study patient ITP PC le 20 X 109/L , without life threaten bleeding . Eligible patient randomize one 2 regimen ( IVIG + placebo IVIG + IV corticosteroid ) . The study design double-blind trial , patient treat physician aware regimen patient randomize . PC 's measure surrogate measure bleed risk ; bleed score ( score generate observe patient bleed symptom ) use grade bleeding severity , adverse effect treatment monitor mean questionnaire throughout study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Study IVIG vs. IVIG With High Dose Methylprednisolone Childhood ITP .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rarely child immune thrombocytopenia purpura ( ITP ) present severe life-threatening bleeding . In case important platelet count raise quickly possible . Several study show IVIG corticosteroid raise platelet count , study examine combination IVIG corticosteroids compare IVIG alone raise platelet count childhood ITP . Yet despite lack conclusive evidence indicate steroid give together IVIG effective , combination treatment often give child present life-threatening bleed , e.g . intracranial bleed . In addition presume great effectiveness give two agent together also evidence show combination IVIG steroid may beneficial effect , addition great effectiveness raise platelet count . This include reduce side effect IVIG . We propose compare effectiveness combination IVIG corticosteroid IVIG alone raise platelet count child ITP platelet count le 20 x 109/L . Patient eligible conjunction treat physician decide treated IVIG . In way require intravenous regardless study participation . The primary outcome rise platelet count reflect platelet count 24 hour . Hypothesis : IVMP IVIG , administer together , 1. increase PC faster , 2. minimize adverse effect IVIG , 3. lead sustain increase PC ( long time need retreatment ) If show combination agent result quick rise PC , would support justify use combination therapy emergency situation . Study Proposal Methods : We propose prospectively evaluate 2 treatment regimen patient childhood ITP : Regimen A : Placebo follow IVIG 1 g/kg ( Gamunex® Immune Globulin Intravenous [ Human ] , 10 % ; Bayer ) * x 1 dose Regimen B : Combination therapy ( IV MP ( Solu-Medrol® , Upjohn ) 30 mg/kg ( max . 1 g ) 30 min follow IVIG 1 g/kg ( Gamunex® Immune Globulin Intravenous [ Human ] , 10 % ; Bayer ) * x 1 dose *Gamunex give accord manufacturer 's guideline . Gamunex demonstrate safely effectively administer mean rapid infusion protocol whereby give period 2 hour ( although case need give slow rate longer period time ) .</detailed_description>
