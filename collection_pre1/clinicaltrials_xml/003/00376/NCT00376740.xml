	<brief_title>Effectiveness Zoledronic Acid Prevention Osteoporosis Early Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Letrozole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Letrozole aromatase inhibitor use treatment hormone receptor positive metastatic breast cancer postmenopausal women.It recently approve use many country adjuvant therapy early breast cancer ; often use adjuvant regimen follow 2-3 year tamoxifen treatment extend adjuvant therapy 5 year tamoxifen . Letrozole inhibit conversion androgen estrogens vitro vivo . Plasma level estradiol relate estrogen compound postmenopausal patient receive letrozole suppress 95 % baseline often undetectable.The estrogen deprivation woman receive letrozole may cause increase bone resorption bone loss.Studies compare tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor , adjuvant therapy show increase fracture rate , decrease bone mineral density patient receive aromatase inhibitor . Zoledronic acid intravenously administer bisphosphonate inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption . Intravenous bisphosphonates effective reduce rate skeletal complication , include fracture , patient metastatic breast cancer tumor give every week . Small clinical trial give evidence osteoporosis effectively treat one two dos intravenous zoledronic acid per year . This study determine effect give zoledronic acid every 6 month bone mineral density patient receive letrozole adjuvant therapy early breast cancer receive adjuvant tamoxifen least 2.5 year . Patients randomize receive zoledronic acid either start letrozole therapy bone mineral density T score drop - 2 standard deviation occurrence non-trauma related fracture .</detailed_description>
