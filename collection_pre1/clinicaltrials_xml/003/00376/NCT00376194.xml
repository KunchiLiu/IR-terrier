	<brief_summary>This study examine whether DMSA , oral chelating agent remove mercury metal body , beneficial child autism . DMSA commonly use treat autism , although never test control study proof help child disorder . Support use base single-case report benefit chelation DMSA . This study help determine whether DMSA useful treat autism . Children 4 10 year age autism spectrum disorder weigh least 33 pound , detectable , toxic , level mercury lead blood , previously receive chelation therapy may eligible study . Participants complete medical history , behavioral psychological assessment physical examination . Blood , hair , urine stool sample collect test . Because DMSA remove mineral body need , zinc iron , well toxic lead mercury , participant take daily multivitamin supplement start 1 month begin chelation therapy continue duration treatment . After 1 month supplementation regimen , child assign receive DMSA placebo 12 week , divide six 2-week cycle . They take assign drug 3 time day day 1 , 2 3 cycle continue multivitamin every day . The child see clinic immediately first , third sixth cycle . At checkup , parent guardian answer set question child 's autism symptom , physical health medication side effect . Blood , urine stool sample collect laboratory testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mercury Chelation Treat Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chelation metal widely use community treat individual Autism Spectrum Disorder ( ASD ) , survey estimate 1 12 child autism undergone chelation . This widespread use reflect hypothesis many case ASD cause exposure thimerosal , ethylmercury-based compound use previously US vaccine preservative routine childhood immunization . The prevalent use chelation therapy stand stark contrast lack scientific clinical evidence efficacy , create public health imperative empiric data . Thus propose control trial effect chelation core behavioral symptom overall functioning child ASD . The present investigation double-blind , randomize placebo-controlled study oral chelate agent meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid ( DMSA ; succimer ) among 120 child , age four ten year , meet criterion ASD . Pre- post-treatment behavioral rating use evaluate efficacy chelation . In addition , child undergo comprehensive medical history , physical examination laboratory analysis . Our objective quantify difference behavioral function chelation treatment group placebo control group . Analysis mercury level course treatment use confirm expect DMSA-induced excretion mercury identify difference among child extent excretion . Our primary hypothesis , average relative control group , child ASD undergo chelation DMSA show great improvement communication social behavior .</detailed_description>
