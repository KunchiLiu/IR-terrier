	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well education without physical therapy intervention work prevent lymphedema woman stage I , II , III breast cancer undergo axillary lymph node dissection ( surgery remove lymph node find armpit region ) . Lymphedema condition extra lymph fluid build tissue cause swell arm leg lymph vessel block , damage , remove surgery . A personalized physical therapy intervention education material may better education material alone prevent lymphedema woman breast cancer undergo axillary lymph node dissection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To test , group randomize control trial , efficacy program versus education reduce incidence lymphedema . II . To compare severity lymphedema , term change arm circumference site great difference continuous variable two intervention . III . To assess agreement patient ' self-report swelling ( mild , moderate , severe ) extent circumferential measurement difference treat side contralateral arm site great difference . IV . To compare health-related quality life ( Factional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Breast [ FACT-B ] +4 score ) two intervention . V. To characterize adherence lymphedema prevention exercise , lymphedema knowledge , range motion . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Six week surgery , patient receive brief initial post-operative care session describe lymphedema risk prevention oral instruction write material . Patients complete physical assessment questionnaires 6 week 6 , 12 , 18 month . Patients also contact telephone 9 15 month . ARM II : Patients receive lymphedema education complete physical assessment questionnaires Arm I . Patients also complete personalized physical therapy intervention , receive refrigerator magnet , 15-minute video reinforces information exercise .</detailed_description>
