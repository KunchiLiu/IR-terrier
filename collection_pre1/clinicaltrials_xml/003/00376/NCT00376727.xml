	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose cetuximab treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cetuximab Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose cetuximab patient advance solid tumor . Secondary - Evaluate safety tolerability drug patient . - Develop detail scale assessment rash patient . - Investigate potential predictor response use correlative study patient tissue , buccal mucosa , blood sample . - Obtain preliminary efficacy data evaluate relationship efficacy grade rash . - Correlate downstream marker ( e.g. , pMAPK , pAKT , Ki-67 ) presence epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) polymorphisms clinical response and/or survival . - Examine level downstream marker protein buccal cell obtain pre- post-treatment . - Correlate basal p27 expression level response and/or survival . - Determine presence K-RAS mutation influence response survival outcome . - Correlate presence absence mutant K-RAS tumor DNA shed patient plasma response and/or outcome . - Correlate level cytokines chemokines rash clinical response . OUTLINE : This open-label , dose-escalation study . Patients receive cetuximab IV 90 minute weekly 4 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos cetuximab maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . At least 6 patient treated MTD . Patients undergo blood buccal mucosa collection baseline prior course 2 3 treatment molecular correlative study . Archival tumor tissue specimens also use molecular correlative study . Immunologic correlative study perform use patient blood sample . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 20 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed write informed consent Histologically cytologically proven advanced solid tumor curable surgery , radiation therapy standard chemo , immuno , hormonal therapy . A specific primary cancer need identify ( i.e. , unknown primary eligible ) . Patients must receive least one prior regimen ( chemotherapy and/or radiation ) metastatic disease . There limit number prior therapy . Any prior chemotherapy must complete least 4 week prior start study therapy . Previous radiation therapy must complete least 2 week prior start study therapy . All side effect prior therapy must resolve prior start study therapy . Patients ZUBROD performance status 02 ( see Appendix 1 ) . Patients must measurable disease evaluable disease . Patients must estimate survival least 3 month . Patients asymptomatic treat brain metastasis ( surgical resection radiotherapy ) may include neurologically stable steroid least 4 week . Patients &gt; /= 18 year age . Patients reproductive potential must agree use effective contraceptive method treatment 3 month afterward effect cetuximab unborn fetus unknown . Patients must adequate hematologic function define : ANC &gt; /= 1,500/mm3 , platelet &gt; /= 100,000/mm3 . Patients must adequate hepatic function define SGOT &lt; /= 3 x institutional UNL serum bilirubin &lt; /= 2.0 mg/dL . Patients must adequate renal function define serum creatinine level &lt; /= 1.6 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance &gt; /= 40 ml/min . Female patient pregnant breastfeeding effect cetuximab unborn fetus unknown . Documentation negative pregnancy test prior treatment required woman reproductive potential . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include limited ongoing infection active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis still require steroid . Patients receive prior cetuximab therapy , prior therapy drug target EGF receptor ( include , limited , Iressa , Tarceva , Herceptin , CI1033 , etc . ) , prior therapy monoclonal antibody . Patients receive prior chemotherapy within 4 week radiation therapy within 2 week prior start study therapy . Prior hypersensitivity reaction chimerized murine monoclonal antibody therapy . Patients may receive chemotherapy , radiation therapy , biologic therapy study .</criteria>
