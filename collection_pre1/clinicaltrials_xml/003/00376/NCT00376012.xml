	<brief_summary>Title : Randomized clinical trial ass efficacy short course intermittent regimens treatment HIV-associated tuberculosis Phase : Phase III trial Population : 300 HIV positive patient tuberculosis . Number Sites : Four 1 . Tuberculosis Research Centre , Chennai 2 . Government General Hospital , Chennai 3 . Government Hospital Thoracic Medicine , Tambaram 4 . Government Rajaji Hospital , Madurai Study Duration:36 month Study Objective : To study efficacy standard RNTCP Category I regimen ( 2EHRZ3 / 4RH3 ) control arm vs. extend continuation phase regimen 2EHRZ3 / 7 RH3 treatment pulmonary extrapulmonary TB HIV positive patient . 2 . To study relationship stage HIV disease response anti-TB treatment . 3 . To study recurrence nature ( relapse/re-infection ) detail use RFLP analysis . Study Design : It two arm prospective randomize open label control clinical trial stratify random allocation base CD4 count sputum smear grade . All enrol patient treat accord RNTCP guideline intensive phase . In continuation phase , Cat I patient stratify CD4 count smear grade , randomly allocate either standard RNTCP regimen , alternative extend regimen ( 2EHRZ3/4RH3 2EHRZ3/7RH3 ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Course Intermittent Regimens Treatment HIV-Associated Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All HIV positive patient seek care one study center , age 15 year , suffer serious illness , non-pregnant diagnose TB briefly explain treatment trial.Patients willing participate trial ask provide write consent . Patients refuse participation study manage accord RNTCP guideline . All patient provide write consent participate treatment trial interview social worker use standard questionnaire . Patients anti-retroviral drug exclude study . Blood sample collect patient meet initial eligibility criterion test laboratory eligibility criterion . Laboratory investigation include complete heamogram , Renal function test , Liver function test , random blood sugar , urine albumin urine sugar . Patients fulfill laboratory criterion ( hemoglobin &gt; 70 g/L , granulocyte count &gt; 1.1 X 109/L , platelet count &gt; 100X 109/L , serum alanine amino transferase concentration &lt; 2.5 time upper limit normal , serum creatinine concentration &lt; 1.1mg % , random blood sugar &lt; 140 mg/dl ) enrol study . Randomization Dosing : All patient enrol treatment trial receive supervise directly observe treatment intensive phase . At treatment initiation , patient counsel importance treatment regularity . While patient undergo intensive phase treatment , randomize either standard regimen extend regimen soon CD4 result available . Randomization do accord permuted block scheme block four , stratify CD4 count ( &gt; 200 â‰¤200 ) smear grade ( 0 , 1+ , 2+ , 3+ ) . The treatment assignment list generate start trial sequentially number sealed envelope contain treatment assign prepared independently . The treatment regimens arm trial follow : Category I RNTCP regimen 2EHRZ3/4RH3 Trial regimen 2EHRZ3/7RH3 Category II RNTCP regimen 2SEHRZ3/1EHRZ3/5EHR3 Category III RNTCP regimen 2HRZ3/4RH3 . All anti-TB drug administer per RNTCP strategy DOTS . Patients reside Chennai Madurai attend respective centers/ sub-centers three time week intensive phase treatment ( first two/three month ) week continuation phase ( four seven month ) . Dosages per RNTCP manual may modify patient extremely debilitate ( weight &lt; 30 kg ) . Patients treatment arm receive 10 mg Pyridoxine treatment day Co-trimoxazole DS 1 tablet daily . During chemotherapy , patient call clinic monthly clinical evaluation . During follow-up visit clinic ( monthly 24 month , every 3 month ) , patient thoroughly evaluate likely drug toxicity information adverse effect record standardized toxicity chart . Compliance therapy measure check treatment card , DOTS provider notebook empty drug packet . Additionally , spot urine examination perform check acetyl isoniazid rifampicin level monthly . Statistical analysis : The intention-to-treat approach use analyze data primary secondary end point . Annual interim analysis do ensure timely identification significant risk benefit patient . Comparisons categorical variable do chi-square test Fisher 's exact test . Continuous variable compare test Wilcoxon 's rank sum test . Survival estimate make Kaplan-Meier method . Comparison Kaplan-Meier survival curve make log-rank test . Multivariate analyse perform use Cox 's proportional Hazards model .</detailed_description>
