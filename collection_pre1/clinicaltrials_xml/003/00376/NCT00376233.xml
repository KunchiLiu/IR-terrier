	<brief_summary>Increasing evidence suggest modulate effect cannabinoids time onset , severity , outcome schizophrenia . Efforts discover underlie pathomechanism lead assumption gene x environment interaction include premorbid genetical vulnerability worsen effect continue cannabis use . For main characteristic psychoactive delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol affinity biological membrane , know disturbed schizophrenia patient genetic high-risk population . Here assess hypothesise association premorbid lipid disturbance metabolic effect external cannabinoids schizophrenia . Intensity niacin ( methylnicotinate ) skin flushing , indicate disturb prostaglandin-mediated process , use peripheral marker lipid-arachidonic acid pathway investigate cannabis consume non-consuming schizophrenia patient healthy control . Methylnicotinate apply three concentration onto forearm skin . Flush response assess three minute interval 15 min use optical reflection spectroscopy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Niacin Flushing Marker Cannabis Effects Arachidonic Acid Pathways Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects Niacin skin test perform acutely ill consecutively admit schizophrenia patient suffer two psychotic episode . All meet DSM-IV criterion paranoide schizophrenia . Diagnosis make two independent experienced psychiatrist support structured clinical interview ( SCID IV ) ( Wittchen et al 1997 ) . Majority patient treat mostly atypical neuroleptic drug . The patient population subdivide one group use cannabis regular basis ( ≥ 0,5 g/d , least 3 month ) prior admission , another group never use cannabis apart unique trial . Cannabis consume patient use drug alcohol regular basis . Psychiatric symptom assess use Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) ( Overall Gorham 1962 ) , Scale Assessment Positive Symptoms ( SAPS ) ( Andreasen 1984 ) , Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) ( Andreasen 1983 ) , Symptom Check List 1990 Revised ( SCL 90-R ) ( Kaplan et al 1998 ) . Patients compare healthy volunteer recruit newspaper advertisement include one group cannabis user ( duration dose cannabis use patient ) one group without cannabis experience . Controls interview in-depth rule current psychiatric diagnosis psychiatric personal family history . As patient , SCL 90-R also apply control . All cannabis-using participant test positive cannabinoids urine time niacin test . Subjects current history skin disorder ( eczema , atopical dermatitis , psoriasis ) recent treatment steroid non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug ( e.g . acetylsalicylic acid ) exclude study niacin testing . The study approve Ethics Committee Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena . All participant give write informed consent participate study . Niacin skin test protocol Methylnicotinate ( C7H7NO2 , 99 % , Sigma-ALDRICH Chemie GmbH , Germany ) apply simultaneously three dilution ( 0.001 M , 0.01 M , 0.1 M ) 50 µl skin inner side forearm use chambered plaster epicutaneous testing . After 90 sec plaster remove . Skin flush quantify 15 minute methylnicotinate exposure 3-min interval , start 90 sec removal methylnicotinate patch . Methylnicotinate solution freshly prepared test prevent influence sunlight . Reflection spectroscopy Optical reflection spectroscopy ( ORS ) apply described detail Smesny et al 2001 . Skin content oxygenate blood assessed handheld optical reflection spectrometer ( spectral range : 400 nm 700 nm , area measurement : diameter 5 mm ) , use oxyhemoglobin ( HbO2 ) absorption double peak 542 nm 577 nm . Each measurement repeat three time ( within 10 sec ) average . Spectroscopic data process automatically create difference spectra subtraction pre-stimulation reflection intensity ( also measure three time ) test intensity . Two Gaussian curve fit HbO2-absorption double peak . The area result sum curve take measure current skin flushing ( measure arbitrary unit [ a.u. ] ) . Data analysis We plan conduct repeated measure analysis variance ( ANOVA ) TIME ( 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 min ) methylnicotinate CONCENTRATION ( 0.001 M , 0.01 M , 0.1 M ) within-subject factor GROUP ( patient , control ) CANNABIS ( cannabis user , cannabis non-user ) subject factor . GENDER , AGE treat co-variates . For post-hoc comparison single value , Mann-Whitney-U-Tests calculate . Psychopathological rating SCL 90-R compare group use univariate ANOVA group factor ( GROUP , CANNABIS ) co-variates ( AGE , GENDER ) . Furthermore , effect cannabis use SAPS , SANS , BPRS investigate within patient group . In order explore possible association age psychopathological rating skin flushing , Spearman correlation coefficient calculate . Due high number calculate coefficient significance level set p &lt; 0.01 .</detailed_description>
