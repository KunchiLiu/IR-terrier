	<brief_summary>Antimalarial chemoprophylaxis reduce morbidity mortality malaria child . However , approach malaria control implement widely concern possible effect development resistance natural immunity . Intermittent preventive treatment ( IPT ) may able achieve beneficial effect chemoprophylaxis without drawback . Recently , show IPT give Senegalese child age five year three occasion malaria transmission season reduce incidence clinical malaria approximately 90 % . However , uncertain intervention effectively deliver . Therefore , 26 Maternal Child Health ( MCH ) trek clinic Upper River Division , south River Gambia , average catchment population 400-500 child 5 year age , randomly allocate receive IPT MCH trek team IPT dispenser ( village health worker , traditional birth attendant community mother base primary health care village ) . Treatment single dose sulfadoxine /pyrimethamine ( SP ) plus three dos amodiaquine give study subject monthly interval three occasion month September , October November . The primary end point incidence clinical attack malaria detect passive case detection , cost-effectiveness delivery method . Important secondary endpoint coverage equity coverage IPT prevent malaria morbidity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3 . OBJECTIVES The objective trial study effectiveness cost-effectiveness two approach administration intermittent preventive treatment Gambian child - distribution village volunteer EPI trek team . 5 STUDY DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY The unit randomization catchment population monthly EPI trek clinic . There 33 trek clinic total south bank URD 27 rural . The rural trekking clinic select randomization . 26 rural cluster ( two merge give even number ) stratify health facility catchment area ( Gambissara , Basse , Fatoto ) . Constrained randomization use ensure balance within strata regard distribution PHC key village population size . The bednet coverage URD estimate 65 % . However , enumeration , detail bed net usage community assess . In collaboration malaria control programme , facilitate provision bed net household without one . At begin rainy season permethrin provide household bednets . 5.1 Malaria card After enumeration complete , database contain list eligible child establish . The database use generate list participate study child village . A record system use appropriate visual aid devise use IPTc dispenser . This consist `` malaria card '' hold mother guardian child IPT register hold IPTc dispenser staff DHT trekking team . On malaria card hold mother , compound number study number write Arabic English , together child 's name name parent . The dosage trial medication give indicate malaria card register use coloured circle semi-circles ( full circle one tablet semi-circle half tablet ) . The register hold IPTc dispenser DHT staff contain similar information malaria card . When child present health facility medication , DHT staff IPTc dispenser examine malaria card study subject . Medication give study subject correct identification match information malaria card hold mother register hold IPTc dispenser DHT . It envisage DHT staff IPTc dispenser take part study pay modest salary supplement contribution project . However , detail payment discuss EPI unit Basse DHT . 5.2 Cross-section survey In December , end malaria transmission season , cross-sectional survey child less 6yrs undertaken 26 cluster . A questionnaire determine asset rating wealth index complete . Information demographic , bed net usage , socio-economic status , health seek behaviour utilisation pattern profile collect , clinical history obtain physical examination perform , include abdominal palpation splenomegaly measurement height , weight axillary body temperature . 5.3 Distribution tablet 5.3.1 Distribution tablet villages Each key PHC village health post staff community health nurse . There 29 PHC village majority village health worker traditional birth attendant . The three town basic health facility ( Basse , Fatoto Gambisara ) exclude evaluation , trial focus community study area . The trial medication administer IPTc dispenser base PHC village . The IPTc dispenser distribute trial medication central point ( usually health post ) first Wednesday month September , October November . Mothers carers ask bring child central point morning IPTc dispenser available distribute drug . When child present central point medication , IPTc dispenser identify study subject use malaria card hold mother match information malaria card register . When satisfied correctly identify study subject information malaria card match register , correct dosage trial medication give study subject . The first dose treatment take direct supervision IPTc dispenser mark register malaria card show child receive tablet . The remain two dos give mother guardian child clear instruction administer drug . 5.3.2 Distribution tablet trek clinic A member MCH trek team ( designate IPTc officer ) 3 basic health facility ( Basse , Fatoto Gambissara ) identify EPI team give responsibility delivery IPT trekking clinic , allocate randomization deliver IPTc . Thus , EPI team deliver IPTc trek clinic others . The date monthly treatment write Arabic English `` malaria card '' . To ensure child receive dos IPTc , different colour `` malaria card '' issue child village child receive medication IPTc dispenser allocate receive medication MCH trek clinic . IPTc dispenser IPTc officer teach give medication child correct colour card . At end malaria transmission season , total number complete treatment dose child trial take record . Compliance check rolling basis throughout study assess number correct dose medication receive . In addition , urine sample collect random sample 100 child month two-week period follow administration IPTc test presence SP urine use Eggelte dipstick . 5.4 Morbidity surveillance rainy season Passive surveillance malaria maintain throughout transmission season . 5.5 Surveillance severe malaria Records keep admission study child Basse Fatoto Health Centres . Physicians nurse base facility ask look child severe malaria , admission attribute malaria carefully document . 5.6 Surveillance overall cause specific mortality Deaths investigate use postmortem questionnaire technique cause death establish wherever possible . 5.7 Nested case control study To estimate effect inequality wealth malaria morbidity prevention intermittent treatment , -a nest case control approach use determine distribution malaria morbidity relation two measure socioeconomic status - wealth rating scale asset index . 5.8 Study cost-effectiveness A cost-effectiveness analysis undertaken societal perspective , mean cost effect , matter accrue , measure value . 5.8.1 Programme cost : The cost two mode deliver IPTc assess use bottom-up 'ingredients ' approach involve identification resource require two mode delivery . 5.8.2 Resource saving : The mode delivery compare respect resource saving result few child treat malaria related illness result good IPTc coverage . 5.8.3 Cost-effectiveness : For mode delivery , two cost-effectiveness ratio calculate : ( ) cost per child fully adhere treatment ; ( ii ) cost per case malaria avert . In addition , net cost-effectiveness ratio calculate subtracting resource save total programme cost divide relevant outcome measure . The incidence malaria cost compare two delivery arm cost per additional case avert calculate . 5.9 Equity The impact different delivery strategy alleviate ( exacerbate ) three form equity measure . Equity outcomes cost delivery mode also compare use benefit-incidence analysis . 5.9.1 Equality utilization adherence : To determine impact term IPT coverage , level adherence also compare across two delivery strategy ; cross-section survey use . 5.9.2 Equality access : Here measure whether household opportunity benefit mode delivery . This involve define measure financial access , geographical access , informational access cultural/gender barrier access . Approximately 25 compliers 25 non-compliers sub-sample 12 cluster interview factor influence access delivery strategy . 5.9.3 Benefit-incidence-analysis : Utilization access data rich poor household compare cost provide service . This involve use benefit-incidence-analysis analyze impact government expenditure poverty . 5.9.4 Cost-effectiveness data collection : Health service cost data include capital cost , consumables , salary etc . collect careful review health facility record consultation administration staff . Costs community collect use interviewer administer questionnaire recently develop GMP PhD student .</detailed_description>
