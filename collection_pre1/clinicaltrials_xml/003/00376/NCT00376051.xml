	<brief_summary>Frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD ) common cause early-onset dementia . FTLD characterize multiple behavioral symptom include mental rigidity , irritability , emotional blunting , disinhibition , apathy , aggression . These behavioural disturbance particularly important increase caregiver burden may lead early institutionalization . While cause FTLD largely unknown , great deal evidence suggest brain chemical call serotonin regulates many behaviour disturb FTLD . Our objective therefore determine whether dysfunction brain 's serotonin system responsible behavioural problem among FTLD patient . We hope take first step towards scientific understand behavioural symptom FTD , use finding support large study optimize treatment target behavioural disturbance FTLD use antidepressant citalopram . Citalopram increase transmission serotonin ; plan use medication determine whether difference serotonin system function FTLD patient display different level behavioural disturbance . Patients give citalopram blood drawn 2 3 hour determine plasma level hormone cortisol prolactin time . These hormone good indicator serotonergic function central nervous system . We expect patient low level serotonergic function severe behavioural disturbance less responsive treatment citalopram . Following first test day , provide patient 6-week supply citalopram , assess change behaviour end treatment . This study aim obtain good understanding change serotonin system relate behavioural symptom FTLD patient . Using information pilot study , plan large study determine whether certain behaviour respond treatment citalopram , , determine whether possible predict patient , base individual characteristic , likely respond treatment . This methodology therefore provide scientific rationale treatment FTLD , also provide guidance ongoing , individualized therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : A hallmark frontotemporal lobar degeneration ( FTLD ) associate behavioural disturbance ( BPSD ) , include disinhibition , aggression , apathy , agitation , depression , inappropriate affect . Current evidence suggest secondary change serotonergic system may key many symptom FTLD . Our primary objective evaluate ability serotonergic dysfunction , measure oral citalopram challenge , predict subsequent behavioural response pharmacotherapy citalopram . As secondary objective , explore relationship specific BPSDs level serotonergic dysfunction . Hypotheses : We predict patient FTLD respond citalopram pharmacotherapy show great dysfunction serotonergic system , measure citalopram challenge , patient respond . This hypothesis evaluate vivo use peak change plasma concentration cortisol prolactin indicator serotonergic dysfunction follow oral citalopram challenge . Research Plan : A consecutive sample patient attend FTLD clinic exhibit significant BPSD recruit study.Because serotonin promote cortisol prolactin secretion via hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , hormone show reliable marker serotonergic function . Their level therefore measure blood sample take baseline 2 3 hour administration 20 mg citalopram . Changes cortisol level citalopram administration use primary measure serotonergic functioning . We expect find inverse correlation cortisol response citalopram challenge severity BPSD accord total Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( NPI ) score . Subsequent citalopram challenge , participant treat BPSD open-label citalopram ( 20-40 mg ) 6 week . At end period , patient re-assessed NPI . The magnitude response , base change NPI score , correlate citalopram challenge test result . It expect patient show severe serotonergic dysfunction well response daily citalopram treatment . Relevance : The result study scientific understand neurochemical basis underlie BPSD FTLD . To date , treatment FTLD patient rely largely understanding treatment dementia , due lack research area FTLD . Therefore , work may aid development targeted therapy specific FTLD .</detailed_description>
