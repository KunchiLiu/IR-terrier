	<brief_summary>Restenosis require reintervention still limitation percutaneous coronary angioplasty . Despite use Drug elute stent ( DES ) , rate restenosis remain 7 % 16 % diabetic patient , make challenge problem interventional cardiology . Still , clinical trial , attempt successfully limit neointimal formation coronary stenting . Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) , like pioglitazone ( pio ) rosiglitazone , novel class oral antidiabetic agent currently use treat patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . These agent increase insulin sensitivity , , favorable effect blood glucose level lipid profile treat patient . Beyond metabolic action , TZDs show exhibit antiinflammatory antiatherogenic effect vascular cell vitro limit lesion development various animal model arteriosclerosis . Moreover , TZDs inhibit VSMC proliferation migration , 2 critical process neointimal formation coronary stenting . Data rodent model suggest TZDs limit intimal proliferation vascular injury , clinical study type 2 diabetic coronary artery disease ( CAD ) patient , TZDs show reduce neointimal formation well restenosis coronary stent implantation . Still , remain unclear extend effect depend metabolic action drug might mainly due improvement glycemic control . Recently report prevention restenosis type 2 diabetic patient ( T2DM ) use TZDs publish . All use BMS endoprosthetic device . None evaluate use TZDs combination DES . Aim study evaluate efficacy pioglitazone prevention in-stent restenosis successful implantation sirolimus-eluting coronary stent treatment de-novo `` complex '' coronary vessel disease patient T2DM stable coronary artery disease . Study primary end-point late-loss 9 months.Secondary end-point include binary restenosis MACE 1 , 9 12 month , stent thrombosis 12 month .</brief_summary>

Safety Tolerability 12.1 Definition Adverse Events ( AE ) An AE define untoward medical occurrence clinical investigation subject administer pharmaceutical product ; necessarily causal relationship treatment . An AE therefore unfavourable unintended sign ( e.g. , abnormal laboratory find ) , symptom , disease temporally associate use medicinal product , whether consider related medicinal product . 12.2 Definition Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) A serious adverse event ( SAE ) define untoward medical occurrence dose : 1 . Results DEATH . 2 . Is LIFE THREATENING . • The term `` life threaten '' refers event subject risk death time event ; refer event hypothetically might cause death severe . 3 . Requires inpatient HOSPITALIZATION prolongation exist hospitalization . 4 . Results persistent significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY . 5 . Leads CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT . 6 . Is IMPORTANT MEDICAL EVENT satisfies follow : - May require intervention prevent item 1 5 . - May expose subject danger , even though event immediately life threaten fatal result hospitalization . - Includes event synonym describe Takeda Medically Significant List ( Table A ) : Table A Takeda Medically Significant List Term Acute respiratory failure/acute respiratory distress syndrome Hepatic necrosis Ventricular fibrillation Acute liver failure Torsade de point Anaphylactic shock Malignant hypertension Acute renal failure Convulsive seizures Pulmonary hypertension Agranulocytosis Pulmonary fibrosis Aplastic anemia Confirmed suspect endotoxin shock Toxic epidermal necrolysis Confirmed suspect transmission infectious agent product Stevens-Johnson syndrome 12.3 Severity AEs The different category intensity ( severity ) characterize follow : Mild : The event transient easily tolerate subject . Moderate : The event cause subject discomfort interrupt subject 's usual activity . Severe : The event cause considerable interference subject 's usual activity . 12.4 Causality AEs The relationship AE study drug assess use follow category : Definite : An AE follow reasonable temporal sequence administration drug ( include course treatment withdrawal drug ) AND satisfy follow : - Reappearance similar reaction upon readministration ( rechallenge ) . - Positive result drug sensitivity test ( skin test , etc ) . - Toxic level drug reveal measurement drug concentration blood another body fluid . Probable : An AE follow reasonable temporal sequence administration drug ( include course withdrawal drug ) AND involvement factor drug , underlie disease , complication , concomitant drug , concurrent treatment reasonably exclude . Possible : An AE follow reasonable temporal sequence administration drug ( include course withdrawal drug ) AND possible involvement drug argue although factor drug , underlie disease , complication , concomitant drug , concurrent treatment also may responsible . For example , similar report past , include report analogue , occurrence event could predict pharmacologic action chemical structure drug . Not relate : An AE follow reasonable temporal sequence administration drug reasonably explain factor , underlie disease , complication , concomitant drug , concurrent treatment . 12.5 Relationship Study Procedures Relationship ( causality ) study procedure determine AEs . The relationship assess `` Yes '' investigator considers reasonable possibility event due study procedure . Otherwise , relationship assess `` No '' . 12.6 AE Reporting At study visit , investigator ass whether subjective AEs occur . A neutral question , `` How feeling since last visit ? '' may ask . Subjects may report AEs occur time study . All subject experience AEs , whether consider associate use study medication , must monitor symptom subside clinically relevant change laboratory value return baseline satisfactory explanation change observe . All AEs document AE page CRF , whether investigator concludes event relate drug treatment .
