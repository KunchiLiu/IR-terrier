	<brief_summary>This study compare implant technique sensory training determine method may improve ability swallow reduce risk choke . Many people brain injury neurological disorder experience difficulty swallowing . Past study show electrical pulse apply muscle increase sensory stimulation throat help . Patients age 18 90 brain injury neurological disorder trouble swallow 6 month long may eligible study . Patients undergo physical examination , pregnancy test , exam throat speech physician . Fiber-optic endoscopic evaluation swallow sensory test involves flexible tube pass nose back throat allow observation voice box . Videofluoroscopy , X-ray head neck , do patient swallow . Patients experience trouble upper esophagus may undergo additional procedure , include manometry measure pressure change back throat , reevaluation fiber-optic tube . Patients study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , use strong magnetic field obtain image body . Patients lie table slide enclose tunnel scanner . The scan take 20 25 minute . Patients assign randomly one two group : intramuscular group , stimulation device implant neck , vibrotactile group , receive vibrotactile stimulator . All patient 10 training session device , plus follow-up . Those patient first group undergo surgery , general anesthesia , implant . Three week follow implant procedure , patient come NIH stimulator turn programmed learn use device . Those patient second group 2 3 week train use vibrotactile device , take home use . All patient return NIH 3 month ensure proper use device , visit follow-up 6 month 12 month test questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Implanted Neuroprosthesis With Sensory Training Improving Airway Protection Chronic Dysphagia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine implanted neuroprosthesis improve airway protection swallow chronic pharyngeal dysphagia great degree sensory training . The implanted neuroprosthesis provide intramuscular stimulation many 8 hyo-laryngeal muscle . Stimulation coincident button press initiation patient control eat regular interval saliva swallow day and/or night . Sensory train include vibrotactile stimulation neck coincident swallow patient control assist swallow eat saliva swallow day . Study population : Persons chronic ( great 6 month ) dysphagia risk aspiration secondary neurological injury , stroke chronic neurological disease currently require enteric feed severe dietary restriction risk aspiration . Design : A Phase 2 clinical trial random assignment two treatment group blind assessment treatment outcome . Both treatment group undergo 2 week device train speech pathologist . The implant group undergo train start 3 week implantation . They receive prescriptive training level muscle stimulation establish swallow . Patients trained press switch control stimulation swallow . The sensory training group receive amount training provide sensory stimulation coincident attempt swallow . Outcome measure : Blinded assessment risk aspiration videofluoroscopy use NIH Swallowing Safety Scale , patient administration Functional Oral Intake Scale ( FOIS ) Dysphagia Swallowing Quality Life Outcomes Tool ( SWAL_QOL ) prior treatment 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month follow treatment . Patient administration FOIS SWAL_QOL 24-months .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusive age 18 90 . History cerebral vascular accident ( CVA ) , brain injury chronic neurological disease Parkinson disease multiple sclerosis history chemoradiation treatment head neck cancer result chronic dysphagia . Evidence pharyngeal phase dysphagia place patient risk aspiration . Risk aspiration frank aspiration base medical history evidence swallow study . Absence aspiration cause exclusion risk aspiration deem present due impair pharyngeal phase swallow judge expert experienced evaluation dysphagia . The patient may demonstrate evidence aspiration risk aspiration consistency , perhaps secondary pharyngeal retention . Aspiration define passage food , liquid , secretion trachea level vocal fold . Impaired pharyngeal phase swallowing may evidence pharyngeal delay , reduce hyolaryngeal elevation , reduce laryngeal closure , reduce pharyngeal clearance bolus . Signs pharyngeal delay include temporary pool material vallecula eventual spill pyriform sinus . Reduced hyolaryngeal elevation identify larynx protected epiglottal lowering remain opens bolus swallow videoendoscopy . Reduced pharyngeal clearance see videoendoscopy bolus remain vallecula and/or pyriform sinus . Other criterion inclusion subject meet criterion aspiration videofluoroscopy limit number swallow necessitate radiation exposure , noncompliant NPO status : 1 . Not bolus enter esophagus reduce open upper esophageal sphincter , result pool bolus pyriform sinus spill airway . 2 . Many patient dysphagia several year , learn cough bolus hypopharynx spit , thus prevent aspiration continue unable ingest food liquid . This manage accumulation saliva spit cup throughout day . In way although swallow aspirate examination ; rather clear back remain bolus mouth . 3 . Other sign risk aspiration observation liquid food remain pyriform sinus , wet gurgle sound phonation indicate pool vocal fold cough bolus already enter trachea attempt swallow . Duration Dysphagia 6 month . A score 2 great NIH Swallowing Safety Scale . Participants may health problem diabetes mellitus , arteriosclerotic coronary vascular disease history smoking . These cause automatic exclusion , examine individual basis otolaryngologist determine potential risk benefit individual participant . Prior history tracheostomy cause exclusion . Patients currently tracheostomy exclude . Restricted oral intake . Patients demonstrate current dependence alternate mean nutrition hydration ( PEG , PEJ ) ; however , PO intake cause exclusion . Adequate cognitive skill demonstrate MiniMental State Examination ( MMSE ) score great equal 23 . Stable medical status . To determine patient stable medical status prior admission , patient ask provide letter physician state patient medically stable may participate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects Severe Very Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder ( COPD ) . Definition Severe COPD FEV ( 1 ) /FVC ratio le 70 % FEV ( 1 ) 30 less 50 % predict . The definition Very severe COPD FEV ( 1 ) /FVC ratio le 70 % FEV ( 1 ) less 30 % predict . Spirometry perform accord standard American Thoracic Society use reference value include correction race . HIV positive immune compromise . This essential increase risk immune reaction implantation foreign device patient immune compromise . Such patient would much great risk infection implantation device . Participation would likely lead need explanation second surgery . Patients pacemaker , deep brain stimulator indwell electrical device . History rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder , progressive supranuclear palsy , dementia , peripheral neuropathy , multiple system atrophy amyotrophic lateral sclerosis . Severe oral phase swallow deficit , due loss tongue control , prevent bolus retention oral cavity . No aspiration risk aspiration previous assessment preliminary study . An esophageal motility disorder prevent food liquid adequately move esophagus stomach . Pregnant woman exclude participation study involve radiation exposure . Current psychiatric disorder depression . Examples psychiatric disorder exclude : somatoform disorder , conversion disorder , schizophrenia bipolar disorder . Inability coordinate button press swallow ( determined screening ) .</criteria>
