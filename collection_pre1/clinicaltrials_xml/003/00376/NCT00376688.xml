	<brief_title>Temsirolimus Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall activity ( define complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease [ SD ] &gt; = 24 week ) weekly 25 mg intravenous dose temsirolimus patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer . II . To compare activity temsirolimus patient locally advance metastatic breast cancer whose primary tumor mutation phosphoinositide-3-kinase , catalytic , alpha ( PIK3CA ) phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) gene whose tumor mutation PIK3CA gene . III . To examine correlation antitumor activity temsirolimus alteration expression gene PI3K pathway primary tumor biopsy specimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute weekly . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
