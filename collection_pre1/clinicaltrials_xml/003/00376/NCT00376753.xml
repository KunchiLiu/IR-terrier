	<brief_summary>This study examine compare brain activity people focal hand dystonia ( FHD ) healthy volunteer obtain knowledge underlie cause FHD . Patients dystonia muscle spasm cause abnormal posture try perform movement ; FHD affect hand fine finger movement . During fine finger movement , brain control muscle process call surround inhibition . This process may impair people hand dystonia , lead uncontrolled overactivity muscle impair motor function . Healthy volunteer patient FHD 18 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen physical neurological examination . In series three experiment conduct single clinic visit , participant undergo transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) perform finger movement . A wire coil place subject 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse travel scalp skull cause small electrical current outer part brain . The stimulation may cause muscle , hand arm twitching , may affect movement reflex . During stimulation , subject ask contract one finger . In addition TMS , subject surface electromyography . For test , sit chair hand place pillow lap . The electrical activity three muscle right hand record electrode ( small metal disk ) tap skin muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : In sensory system , neural mechanism call surround inhibition ( SI ) sharpen sensation create inhibitory zone around central core activation . This principle describe visual system first , evidence similar mechanism primary motor cortex ( M1 ) involve movement generation control , especially precise motor task . Dystonia generally regard motor execution abnormality due dysfunction cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical motor loop . Using transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , recent finding point highly task-specific impairment motor cortical inhibition patient focal hand dystonia ( FHD ) . The goal research proposal understand underlie physiology relate different inhibitory pathway movement generation control . To achieve goal , different mode voluntary contraction examine healthy control patient FHD prospect new option treatment . STUDY POPULATION : We intend study 100 adult patient FHD 100 healthy volunteer outpatient basis . DESIGN : Participants perform contraction first dorsal interosseous muscle ( FDI ) . At rest , EMG-onset ( premotor ) , phasic tonic contraction single TMS pulse ( Experiment 1 ) double TMS pulse ( Experiment 2 ) apply primary motor cortex ass activation-induced change cortical excitability abductor pollicis brevis muscle ( APB ) , activate . Additionally influence visual feedback short intracortical inhibition ( SICI ) test Experiment 3 . In Experiment 4-8 interhemispheric ( IHI ) , ventral dorso-lateral premotor-motor intracortical inhibition assess . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome measure Experiment 1 difference MEP peak-to-peak amplitude motor condition . The primary outcome measure Experiment 2 , 5 , 6 , 7 8 difference normalize MEP peak-to-peak amplitude motor condition FHD patient healthy volunteer . In Experiments 1 2 , change MEP peak-to-peak amplitude different force level ( 10 % versus 20 % ) second outcome parameter . The primary outcome parameter Experiment 3 change MEP peak-to-peak patient healthy volunteer tonic contraction without visual feedback . In Experiment 4 , Hmax/Mmax ratio primary outcome parameter .</detailed_description>
