	<brief_title>Bioidentical 'Natural ' Hormone Evaluation Early Menopause</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In spite warning regard safety adverse event widely publicize Women 's Health Initiative ( WHI ) , woman continue seek hormone replacement therapy variety reason . Increased cardiovascular event identify WHI important concern consider menopausal hormone replacement . There belief 'natural ' bioidentical hormone replacement therapy could provide safe alternative widely use synthetic hormone replacement therapy . However , never study rigor health care provider adequately advise patient seek 'natural ' bioidentical hormone therapy . This feasibility pilot study design prospective double blind study compare 4 group woman within 7 year menopause . There 10 woman 4 group total 40 woman enrol woman treat 12 month . The Long-Term Goal provide health care practitioner consumer evidence-based recommendation use bioidentical hormone replacement . The Short-Term Goal pilot study determine feasible conduct study bioidentical hormone obtain information could lead large definitive study . We would like provide safety information bioidentical hormone use evaluate surrogate marker cardiovascular disease ( lipid level ) , secondary evaluation breast ( mammogram ) uterus ( endovaginal ultrasound ) , collect information bone preservation . The information gain trial provide information future trial test hypothesis bioidentical hormone replacement therapy provide safe alternative standard hormone replacement therapy : To determine bioidentical hormone replacement therapy associate improved lipid profile ( surrogate marker cardiovascular disease ) compare Prempro . This determine evaluate lipid level baseline 12-month treatment period . Secondary hypothesis also evaluate future include : 1 . To determine bioidentical hormone replacement therapy provide improved short-term risk profile uterine breast health compare Prempro . This accomplish require mammogram endovaginal ultrasound baseline end 12-month treatment period . 2 . To determine bone loss use bioidentical hormone replacement compare Prempro . This aim evaluate Dexa bone scan baseline 12 month . Subjects randomly assign one four arm study 12 month treatment . The standard care arm consist 10 woman receive double blind fashion low-dose Prempro . There 3 treatment arm consist different combination E2 estradiol and/or E3 estriol , combine bioidentical progesterone . These 3 arm 10 subject randomize bioidentical hormone deliver double blind fashion . Since gold standard treatment conventional arm ( Prempro ) , compare bioidentical arm gold standard . This comparison occur end 12 month treatment . In pilot study , also wish collect preliminary data comparison 3 bioidentical hormone arm conventional arm . This necessary currently anecdotal evidence E3 alone without combination E2 may constitute adequate therapy spite low biological activity estrogen receptor . The use high dos E3 without E2 common use complementary alternative practitioner . It expect small pilot study bioidentical hormone provide adequate short-term safety profile cardiovascular , breast uterine health provide guidance large trial long duration . It also expect bone density may maintain bioidentical hormone replacement compare Prempro . There may sufficient number determine significance control arm treatment arm ; however , expect collect useful information future trial . It assume equivalence likely determine base sample size .</detailed_description>
