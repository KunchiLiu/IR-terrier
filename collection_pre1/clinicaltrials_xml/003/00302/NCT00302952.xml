	<brief_title>Lovastatin Treatment Mildly Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RA characterize persistent inflammation peripheral joint , cause pain , stiffness , swell , warmth . The inflammation may cause progressive joint damage destruction , result deformity loss function . Both traditional biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) prescribe RA patient control exist inflammatory symptom affect long-term prognosis . However , DMARD use expensive , long-term safety DMARDs unknown . Lovastatin HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ( also know statin ) use low level cholesterol fat blood . The purpose study examine safety efficacy lovastatin control inflammation individual RA mildly active RA disease despite treatment . Participants randomly assign one two study arm ( Experimental Placebo ) . There four study visit 12 week . At visit , physical exam , vital sign measurement , medication history , pregnancy test ( applicable ) , blood collection occur . Additional safety blood test occur Week 2 . Tender swollen joint count Physician Global Assessment occur study entry Week 12 . Participants also ask complete self-assessments study entry Week 12 .</detailed_description>
