The intervention period consist five four-month performance period . For period , trained reviewer collect medication , blood pressure reading , comorbid condition , medication allergy , lifestyle recommendation VA electronic health record system sample eligible patient physician ' panel . After final performance report , implement 12-month washout period . To determine impact incentive intervention period , perform repeated-measures longitudinal analysis use hospital random effect . We evaluate rate change proportion patient meet study measure time intervention group physician . We assess post-washout performance use linear analysis cluster hospital . To evaluate unintended consequence incentive , examine incidence hypotension physician ' panel . Status : The study complete . The primary finding publish September 2013 Journal American Medical Association ( JAMA ) . We currently prepare manuscript describe finding study 's secondary aim .</detailed_description>
