	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION This project assess scintigraphic diagnosis pathophysiology right heart strain acute pulmonary embolism . The primary purpose validate various scintigraphic method pulmonary angiography standard reference ( purpose A ) . Furthermore , project examines relative contribution 1 ) vascular obstruction , 2 ) vasoactive mediator , 3 ) co-morbidity generation right heart strain ( purpose B ) . BACKGROUND FOR PURPOSE A Acute pulmonary embolism life threaten condition . Early intervention lifesaving treatment associate severe side effect . Thus , establish accurate diagnosis necessary . Clinical presentation physical examination proven insufficient purpose . This also true basic diagnostic investigation , e.g . electrocardiography , arterial blood gas analysis chest x-ray , consider standard test patient symptoms consistent cardiopulmonary disease . For several decade lung scintigraphy consider cornerstone diagnosis acute pulmonary embolism . Planar two-dimensional image pulmonary perfusion obtain use gamma camera intravenous injection radiolabelled microparticles , depict perfusion defect cause e.g . pulmonary embolus . Similarly , ventilatory function assess two-dimensionally planar scintigraphic image follow inhalation radioactive gas aerosol . Lung scintigraphy certain limitation , primarily relate image interpretation . The PIOPED criterion , base combine ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy , gain global acceptance , often inconclusive give rise misunderstanding . A different set interpretation criterion , provide PISA-PED study group , base solely perfusion image . Opposite PIOPED criterion , PISA-PED criterion always conclusive exhibit high sensitivity specificity . The latter , however , gain widespread acceptance PIOPED criterion . It remain uncertain set criterion well confirm exclude diagnosis acute pulmonary . A prospective trial evaluate PIOPED criterion ( original revise ) PISA-PED criterion valid standard reference therefore seem appropriate . The resource demand single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) recently subject renew interest diagnosis acute pulmonary embolism , remain unclear whether technique offer additional information compare conventional planar imaging . SPECT offer three-dimensional image , otherwise technique similar method describe planar image . Combining PISA-PED criterion SPECT image yet test prospective trial , seem highly relevant . Since diagnosis often suspect several time patient , ability distinguish acute chronic change scintigrams essential . It , however , unclear extend fast scintigraphic change resolve . This great implication scintigraphic control patient recover acute pulmonary embolism . A trial regard statement require reliable method test whether patient suffer acute pulmonary embolism : standard reference . Pulmonary angiography traditionally conceive standard reference acute pulmonary embolism , new study employ technique . BACKGROUND FOR PURPOSE B Right heart strain common find acute pulmonary embolism . It result sudden increase pressure pulmonary circulation . Ultrasonographic examination heart echocardiography suitable demonstrate condition find patient acute pulmonary embolism associate considerably bad prognosis . The degree right heart strain exclusively determine extension size embolus . There substantial evidence influence co-morbidity release vasoactive mediator extend right heart strain . The exact interplay three factor completely understood human . Albeit , significant implication therapy , since pharmacological manipulation vascular tone pulmonary circulation possible . This treatment , however , without risk , well-designed study yet address issue patient acute pulmonary embolism . Several case report successful treatment vasodilation , e.g . inhale nitric oxide , publish . A profound understand etiology acute right heart failure acute pulmonary embolism therefore desirable . What individual contribution 1 ) clot burden , 2 ) release vasoactive mediator , 3 ) co-morbidity ? Recently , acute pulmonary embolism divide three category depend clinical presentation echocardiographic finding : 1 ) massive ; patient suffers cardiac arrest cardiogenic shock . Most authority agree patient treat fibrinolytic agent . 2 ) Non-massive ; sign shock right heart strain . In patient indication fibrinolytic agent . 3 ) Sub-massive ; manifestation shock echocardiographic finding consistent right heart strain . The indication fibrinolytic treatment last group unresolved . This study address whether simple method , e.g . peripheral blood sample perfusion scintigraphy determine primary mechanism generation right heart strain individual patient . A later ( yet plan ) intervention study base abovementioned knowledge could address follow question : Should patient sub-massive pulmonary embolism receive treatment fibrinolytic agent ( case major clot burden minor degree pulmonary vasoconstriction ) vasodilator ( minor clot burden , major degree pulmonary vasoconstriction ) ?</detailed_description>
