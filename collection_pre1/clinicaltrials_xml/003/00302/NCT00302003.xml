	<brief_summary>This phase III trial study well combination chemotherapy work give radiation therapy and/or additional chemotherapy treat young patient newly diagnose Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill cancer cell . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) give together radiation therapy may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Investigate paradigm response-based therapy low-risk Hodgkin 's lymphoma eliminate involved-field radiotherapy ( IFRT ) patient achieve complete remission ( CR ) initial chemotherapy . II . Investigate whether 3 course doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine , prednisone , cyclophosphamide ( AV-PC ) treatment low-risk Hodgkin 's lymphoma sufficient induce CR least 80 % patient . III . Investigate whether patient experience low-risk relapse initial treatment chemotherapy alone successfully treated salvage regimen comprise ifosfamide vinorelbine ditartrate dexamethasone , etoposide phosphate , cisplatin , cytarabine ( IV/DECA ) IFRT . IV . Maintain overall survival patient low-risk Hodgkin 's lymphoma 97 % . V. Determine prognostic significance early response measure fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) gallium first course chemotherapy . VI . Evaluate prognostic significance elevation erythrocyte sedimentation rate C-reactive protein time diagnosis patient low-risk Hodgkin 's lymphoma CR rate relapse rate chemotherapy alone . VII . Determine frequency severity late effect therapy , include thyroid dysfunction , infertility , cardiotoxicity , second malignant neoplasm . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . INITIAL CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 10-30 minute cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1-2 , vincristine IV day 1 8 , prednisone orally ( PO ) day 1-7 , filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 3-7 9-14 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) proceed observation . Patients achieve partial remission proceed radiotherapy . Patients low-risk relapse achieve CR initial chemotherapy proceed salvage chemotherapy follow radiotherapy . Patients stable disease disease progression go study . SALVAGE CHEMOTHERAPY : Patients receive ifosfamide IV continuously day 1-4 , vinorelbine ditartrate IV 6-10 minute day 1-5 , G-CSF SC IV begin day 6 continue blood count recover . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course . Patients receive dexamethasone IV 15 minute every 12 hour , etoposide phosphate IV 3 hour every 12 hour , cytarabine IV 3 hour every 12 hour day 1 2 ; cisplatin IV 6 hour day 1 ; G-CSF SC IV begin day 3 continue blood count recover . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course . Patients proceed radiotherapy . INVOLVED-FIELD RADIOTHERAPY ( IFRT ) : Beginning 4 week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo IFRT daily , 5 day week , 2.8 week . Patients achieve CR go study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
