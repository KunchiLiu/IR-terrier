	<detailed_description>Mechanical reperfusion acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) target optimal revascularization epicardial artery also aim improved myocardial salvage . The goal reperfusion therapy shift include reperfusion downstream level capillary bed , might appropriate hypothesis term `` time dependent open artery open microvascular hypothesis . '' Failure achieve myocardial reperfusion despite presence patent coronary artery term `` no-reflow '' phenomenon attribute microvascular dysfunction . It become apparent clinical outcome associate patency epicardial artery , also patency microcirculation . Persistent impairment microcirculation associate poor clinical outcome . Complete reperfusion AMI setting necessitate reopen consecutive vascular compartment way coronary circulation . But , embolization follow percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) situ microthrombi generation microvascular level make goal difficult achieve . For reason , mechanical intervention epicardial coronary artery without use distal protection would n't enough achieve ideal reperfusion ultimate ( microvascular ) level . At point , become evident need develop competent feasible reperfusion strategy help u achieve reperfusion complete possible level . Hypothesis : Complementary intracoronary streptokinase administration primary PCI may provide improvement myocardial perfusion dissolve microvascular thrombus [ situ form embolized proximal site ( spontaneous follow PCI ) ] fibrin . Improvement microvascular perfusion may translate reduction infarct size improvement leave ventricular function long term .</detailed_description>
