	<brief_title>Blood Pressure Lowering Effects Grape Juice</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated blood pressure ( BP ) among common important risk factor atherosclerosis . A number non-pharmacological therapy successfully apply prevent development elevate BP reduce elevate BP . For example DASH Study show diet rich fruit , vegetable low fat dairy product , reduce saturate fat , total fat cholesterol , substantially lower blood pressure normotensive hypertensive individual . Within past three year number small clinical trial suggest suggest drink purple grape juice period 6-12 week may lower blood pressure individual elevate blood pressure . Other clinical trial show Concord grape juice improve function vascular endothelium , possibly provide explanation beneficial effect . However , need prospective , control study determine whether grape juice beneficial effect blood pressure . The present study compare effect drinking Concord purple grape juice ( 7 ml/kg 16 oz/day 70 kg person ) effect calorie-matched placebo 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure , blood pressure reactivity , vascular function men woman category `` pre-hypertension '' ( define blood pressure great 120/80 , less 149/89 mmHg Stage 1 hypertension ( define blood pressure great 140/90 , less 160/100 ) . This study specifically recruit patient systolic blood pressure 130-159 mmHg diastolic blood pressure 85-99 mmHg . The study double blind crossover design order treatment randomize ( grape juice first placebo first ) . A dietician provide subject formal instruction low salt diet , current recommend initial therapy patient Stage 1 hypertension . After 1-week run-in period , subject consume beverage 8 week 4-week rest period treatment . Blood pressure measure treatment period use 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure record . After treatment period , measure change blood pressure induce psychological challenge ( mental arithmetic computer task ) cold pressor test . In order gain insight potential mechanism benefit , also examine effect beverage consumption endothelial function , stiffness central aorta , fast glucose insulin , body weight , marker systemic inflammation , include CD40 ligand C-reactive protein . Finally , store plasma sample future investigation potential effect grape juice cardiovascular system . We hypothesize Concord grape juice favorable effect blood pressure compare placebo .</detailed_description>
