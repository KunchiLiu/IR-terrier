	<detailed_description>Concerta specifically develop replace three time day immediate release ( IR ) methylphenidate ( MPH ) . The clinical advantage offer novel compound go beyond ease administration . By avoid peak valley serum level associate IR MPH , treatment Concerta minimize adverse effect peak break symptom valley secure clinical coverage throughout day , minimize risk adverse effect serum fluctuation occur multiple dose IR formulation MPH . This unique pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic profile Concerta potentially particularly advantageous treatment adult ADHD ) adult ADHD tend forgetful ; b ) forgetfulness make self administration treatment three time day difficult ; c ) forgetfulness lead poor compliance drop effect time attendant detrimental effect clinical control quality life . Subjects randomize pharmacy CONCERTA continue MPH IR TID ratio 4:1 . This study include : 1 ) six-week design document response rate 2 ) assessment impact either MPH IR Concerta functional capacity 3 ) careful assessment safety tolerability</detailed_description>
