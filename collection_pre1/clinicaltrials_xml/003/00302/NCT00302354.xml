	<brief_summary>This double-blind , placebo-controlled study , three-period crossover study examine likeability single dose OROS MPH ( CONCERTAÒ 90mg ) single dose Long-acting MPH ( RITALIN LAÒ 90mg ) . Hypotheses follow : Hypothesis 1 : OROS-MPH ( CONCERTAÒ ) later SODOS-MPH ( RITALIN LAÒ ) Tmax ( time Cmax ) . Hypothesis 2 : The subjective feeling detection likeability would great SODOS-MPH ( RITALIN LAÒ ) equivalent total dose OROS-MPH ( CONCERTAÒ ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Double-blind Randomized , Placebo-controlled , Crossover Study Single Doses OROS Methylphenidate Hydrochloride ( CONCERTA ) Long-acting Methylphenidate Hydrochloride ( RITALIN LA ) Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our recent work suggest potential euphoriant risk associate MPH may moderate oral delivery system longer delivery system may safer immediate release one . OROS-MPH 's pharmacokinetic profile use increase delivery MPH day ( ascend pharmacokinetic curve ) . It design replace IR-MPH TID treatment . Another new long-acting MPH formulation spheroidal oral drug absorption system ( SODAS ) . SODAS-MPH consist capsule two type bead 1 1 ratio . Evaluating whether different long act formulation MPH differ rate onset MPH action ( plasma level ) high clinical , scientific public health relevance . Since rate delivery MPH key factor previously associate detection likeability MPH .</detailed_description>
