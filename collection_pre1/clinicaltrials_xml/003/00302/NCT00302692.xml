	<brief_summary>Advances medical care increase proportion elderly Americans enable remain physically active . This result unprecedented increase number geriatric patient admit trauma center . The elderly constitute 23 % trauma center admission , 36 % trauma death . This disproportionately high mortality attributable high prevalence pre-existing condition , particularly , cardiac disease . Multi-system injury result critical cardiac stress . Although beta-blockade show decrease morbidity mortality patient risk myocardial infarction elective surgery , use trauma patient potential underlying cardiac disease previously study . We hypothesize routine administration beta-blockers resuscitation reduce morbidity mortality elderly trauma patient , risk , underlie cardiac disease . This study randomize , prospective clinical trial . One cohort receive routine trauma intensive care , , care plus beta-blockade completion resuscitation . The primary outcome mortality . Secondary outcome include MI , length stay , organ dysfunction , cardiac , complication . Changes outcome may due reduction myocardial oxygen demand heart rate . Laboratory study demonstrate circulate inflammatory cytokine contribute cardiac risk trauma patient , production influence adrenergic stimulation . We measure circulate IL-6 , TNF alpha , IL-1beta , measure NF-kB p38 MAP kinase activation peripheral blood leukocyte , determine effect beta-blockade production inflammatory marker . Finally , wide variation patient response beta-blockers attribute genetic variability adrenergic receptor . Therefore , identify single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPS ) within beta-adrenergic receptor , determine effect mortality response beta-blockade . This study provide first randomize , prospective trial design reduce morbidity mortality elderly trauma patient risk cardiac disease . The laboratory genetic component provide additional insight may explain treatment effect , lead new therapeutic strategy , potential lead additional area investigation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methods Proposed Research 1 . Study Design : Prospective , randomized clinical trial . 2 . Study Overview : All trauma patient admit ICU &gt; 55 year age primary diagnosis injury screen admission study candidate . Patients exclude non-survivable injury , receive comfort care , advance directive limit aggressive care , heart block , severe asthma , bradycardia ( &lt; 60 bpm ) , beta-blocker therapy , acute evolve myocardial infarction . Informed consent obtain . Some patient may unable provide consent . In case , consent obtain legal surrogate . Consented patient randomized experimental control group . Study procedures commence end-points resuscitation meet 12 hour , define cessation transfusion fluid bolus requirement , systolic blood pressure &gt; 100 mm Hg , heart rate &lt; 130 bpm , adequate urine output , resolve base deficit . The experimental group receive beta-blockers adjust keep heart rate 60-80 bpm end resuscitation hospital discharge . A formal algorithm develop purpose , inserted admission order sheet . Briefly , achieve initially titration intravenous esmolol hydrochloride patient remain goal heart rate stable dose 24 hour , IV PO metoprolol . Therapy withhold event hypotension ( &lt; 100 mmHg ) , decrease cardiac index ( &lt; 2.0 L/min/m2 ) accompany sign inadequate end-organ perfusion . The control group receive standard care injured geriatric patient . Such patient routinely provide beta-blocker therapy . However , beta-blockers use treatment excessive tachycardia , dysrhythmias , post myocardial infarction management , clinically indicate . 3 . Baseline Data Collection : Will include ; age , gender , demographic information , co-morbid condition , pre-injury medication , mechanism injury , Injury Severity Score , Abbreviated Injury Severity Score ( AIS ) . In intensive care unit , pulmonary artery catheter routinely insert critically injure elderly trauma patient respond initial resuscitation . Patients PAC complete hemodynamic profile ( PAWP , CVP , MAP , PAM , CI , SV , SVRI , PVRI , LVSWI ) O2 transport profile ( SvO2 , DO2I , VO2I ) record . Laboratory study include serum lactate , base deficit , CBC , electrolytes , coagulation profile . Blood also obtain measure baseline level marker inflammation ( IL-6 , IL-1 , TNF ) , cardiac injury ( troponin ) , well peripheral blood leukocyte isolation measurement p38 MAP kinase NF-kB activation , genotyping . 4 . Resuscitation Daily Management : Our intensive care unit close unit staffed group six dedicate faculty , certification critical care . Treatments , include resuscitation end-points , management fluid/electrolytes , ventilator therapy , wean , evaluation/treatment fever/sepsis , pain/sedation , nutrition , well management specific injury type , provide accord establish clinical protocol , thus reduce eliminate treatment bias potentially confound management variation . 5 . Outcome Measures : 1 . Mortality : The primary outcome mortality . All patient follow time enrollment study completion . Therefore , duration follow-up vary 1-23 month . 2 . Cardiac Events : ICU record ( flow chart , lab , ECG ) screen daily evidence dysrhythmia , ischemia/MI , hypotension . Diagnosis MI base clinical symptom , ECG change , cardiac biomarkers , autopsy data , available . Studies detection myocardial infarction demonstrate incidence dependent type , frequency , time diagnostic test , well criterion use . Our study base determination MI consensus document Joint European Society Cardiology/American College Cardiology Committee redefinition MI.47 The timing diagnostic test base AHA guideline myocardial infarction surveillance high intermediate risk patient major surgical procedure . Accordingly , ECG obtain baseline , daily two day , surgical procedure , ICU discharge . Biochemical marker obtain baseline , surgical procedure , daily two day , day 4 day ICU discharge ( whichever come first ) .26 Classification cardiac event do individual blind group assignment . 3 . Infection/Organ Dysfunction : ICU record screen daily evidence infection ( fever , alter WBC , pneumonia , abdominal abscess , UTI , line sepsis ) . Sepsis MOD calculate individual blind group allocation . 4 . Length Stay : ICU stay , ventilator day , hospital stay record . 6 . Laboratory Procedures : 1 . Serum Troponins : Serum cardiac troponin I determine ELISA . 2 . Inflammatory Markers : WBC 's isolated whole blood centrifugation , nuclear protein isolated measure NF-kB nuclear translocation . Nuclear protein extract assay ELISA TransAM NF-kB p65 activation assay determine degree NF-kB activation follow LPS stimulation . The amount translocate NF-kB standardized total protein content , determined standard Bradford assay.48 Activation p38 MAP kinase conduct p38 MAP kinase assay kit . Briefly , monoclonal phoso-specific antibody p38 MAP kinase ( Thr180/Tyr182 ) use selectively immunoprecipitate active p38 MAP kinase cell lysates . The result immunoprecipitate incubate ATF-2 fusion protein presence ATP kinase buffer . This allow immunoprecipitated active p38 MAP kinase phosphorylate ATF-2 . Phosphorylation ATF-2 Thr71 measure Western blot use phosphor-ATF-2 ( Thr71 ) antibody . IL-6 concentration plasma determined conventional ELISA , use OptEIATM Sets . Briefly , plate coat monoclonal antibody specific IL-6 . Standards sample added well , IL-6 present bind immobilize antibody . The well wash incubated room temperature avidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate mixed biotinylated anti-human IL-6 antibody . The well wash TMB substrate solution add produce color change . The microwell absorbances read 450 nm . The concentration IL-6 directly proportional color intensity test sample . 3 . Sequencing Beta-Adrenergic Receptor Genotype : The Ser49Gly Arg399Gly SNP ’ adrenergic receptor amplify polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Genotypes assay pyrosequencing DNA sequence analysis . Genomic DNA extract whole blood ammonium acetate-ethanol precipitation yield quantify comparison stain intensity relative lane contain know concentration standards.49 Fragments contain SNP ’ individually PCR-amplified genomic DNA use thermal profile , reaction condition , primer sequence specific SNP . All genotype determine pyrosequence analysis use PSQ 96 SNP Software . Each SNP assay specific primer sequence , enable score heterozygote alternate homozygote equal reliability . Amplification condition establish optimized two dozen locus laboratory past two year . The addition new candidate SNPs become routine matter . We utilized protocol generate genotype data 20 SNP ’ 600 individual publish five manuscript past several year .</detailed_description>
