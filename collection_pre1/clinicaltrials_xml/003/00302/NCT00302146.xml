	<brief_summary>This study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) compare people Gaucher disease Gaucher disease carrier parkinsonism , family member , use dopamine brain comparison healthy normal volunteer people Parkinson disease . PET assess organ function measure metabolism . In study , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use conjunction PET help well interpret understand information glean PET . People 21 year age old follow condition may eligible study : - Gaucher disease parkinsonism - Parkinsonism family history Gaucher disease - Gaucher disease family history parkinsonism - Gaucher disease carrier parkinsonism family history parkinsonism - Unaffected people family history Gaucher disease parkinsonism - Healthy volunteer Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Personal family medical history - Physical examination - PET scan : The subject lie table slide PET scanner head position properly scanner . A catheter insert vein . An initial scan do obtain image radionuclides inject . Radioactive water inject catheter subject ask question order stimulate blood flow certain area brain show part brain activate . Fluorodopa infuse catheter 3 minute . The PET scan last 2 hour . - MRI scan : This test use magnetic field radio wave obtain image organ . The subject lie still bed middle circular scanner 30 minute .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) Imaging People With Gaucher Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An association Gaucher disease parkinsonism demonstrate concurrence parkinsonian manifestation patient Gaucher disease increase incidence glucocerebrosidase ( GBA ) mutation subject parkinsonism various ethnicity . Furthermore , significant number obligate confirm Gaucher carrier parkinsonian manifestation . Thus , alteration GBA appear common risk factor previously think development sporadic Parkinson disease relate disorder . However , affect at-risk individual , identification characterization early parkinsonian manifestation , rate progression symptom study objectively . We propose in-vivo study employ multiple image modality well define phenotype GBA-associated parkinsonism , follow disease progression , identify at-risk individual . The subject include patient Gaucher disease Gaucher carrier parkinsonian manifestation , clinically unaffected at-risk individual carry GBA mutation , have/ first degree relative parkinsonism . The control group consist individual Gaucher disease parkinsonian symptom , relatives probands without GBA mutation , PD patient without GBA mutation , healthy volunteer . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) 6- [ F-18 ] Fluoro-L-Dopa ( 6FD ) use evaluate presynaptic dopaminergic function , 6FD uptake putamen striatum employ measure neuronal structural integrity substantia nigra . Each subject screen MRI rule-out anatomic brain abnormality , delineate area interest PET scan . Subjects also undergo transcranial ultrasonography ( TCS ) ass substantia nigra non-invasively . The result PET scan TCS keep confidential , communicated individual family involve study . In addition imaging study , patient undergo physical neurological examination , neurocognitive evaluation , olfactory testing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The study include adult subject age 21 old carry GBA mutation . The two major study group include subject parkinsonism unaffected subjedcts yet risk first degree family member parkinsonism . Controls include subject without GBA mutation , sporadic PD healthy volunteer family history parkinsonism Gaucher disease . Healthy Volunteers Control subject match age , gender handedness statistical purpose . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The subject exclude study : 1. severe cognitive deficit impair decision make 2. unable medically unsafe withdraw current medication , subject SSRIs psychoactive drug . 3. pregnant nursing . All woman child bear potential undergo pregnancy test . 4 . With history neurologic condition stroke focal brain lesion may result parkinsonian manifestation . Individuals MRI finding exclude study .</criteria>
