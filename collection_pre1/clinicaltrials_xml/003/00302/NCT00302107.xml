	<brief_summary>Objective : To study efficacy tolerability mirtazapine ( Remeron ) treatment PTSD . Research Design : This 8-week randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled treatment trial mirtazapine treatment PTSD define Clinical Assessment PTSD Scale ( CAPS ) . Methodology : After sign informed consent meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion , patient randomize either mirtazapine versus placebo 8-week duration . During study pharmacist maintains randomization log verifies order placebo mirtazapine look-a-like tablet . Patients ' symptom , side effect compliance assess bi-weekly . Based symptomology occurrence side effect , investigator increase medication 15 mg increment , tolerate , maximum therapeutic benefit achieve , exceed 45 mg/day . The dosing bedtime . Compliance assess bi-weekly pill count week 4 week 8 . Patients give supportive clinical management clinic visit . An investigator available telephone 24 hr day case emergency . Patients may see often need . Efficacy measure follow assessment scale : Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( Ham-A ) , Clinical Global Impression Severity Illness ( CGI-s ) , Clinical Global Impression Improvement ( CGI-I ) , Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) , CAPS , Treatment Outcome PTSD rating scale ( TOP-8 ) , Davidson Trauma Scale ( DTS ) . Clinical Significance : Mirtazapine show promise treat PTSD open label trial . This study next step prove mirtazapine 's efficacy treatment PTSD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Title : A Placebo-Controlled Study Mirtazapine PTSD OIF/OEF Veterans Veterans Southwest Asia Conditions Sponsor study : VA Merit grant Research Setting : Subjects recruit mental health primary care outpatient clinic inpatient unit . The informed consent process conduct private setting . Rating scale laboratory procedure also perform private setting . Purpose study include hypothesis test : The primary objective evaluate efficacy tolerability mirtazapine ( Remeron ) treatment PTSD . Primary Hypothesis test : Veterans PTSD improvement symptomatology 8 week treatment mirtazapine compare treated placebo . Background , include result relevant research , gap current knowledge . PTSD common mental illness , afflict 3 percent person , 12 million North Americans . PTSD common consequence disaster , rape , auto accident , violent crime , half trauma victim suffer acute symptom . One fourth victim acute PTSD progress develop chronic PTSD .

Preliminary clinical data open study one small placebo-controlled study mirtazapine treatment PTSD suggest mirtazapine effective may unique pharmacological profile treat PTSD . Potential Benefits research subject knowledge gain : The actual patient participant may benefit reduction underlie psychiatric symptom . There substantial potential knowledge PTSD treatment gain cumulative data gather study may improve health care veteran nonveterans future . Definition population study justification : The population study outpatient veteran current PTSD , diagnose use MINI . Patients may recruit mental health , inpatient unit Primary Care Outpatient Clinics , however ; majority study intend outpatient . The justification use PTSD population new treatment PTSD need , particularly combination medication since monotherapy rarely fully effective . Number subject : 100 subject enrol . Subjects must meet following inclusion exclusion criterion order randomize . Subject inclusion criterion : - Diagnosis PTSD , confirm MINI CAPS - Age 19 old - No substance abuse/dependence previous 4 week ( except nicotine caffeine ) - Free psychotropic medication 2 week ( except 4 week fluoxetine ) - Clinically normal physical laboratory examination ( lab profile list ) . Liver function test ( LFTs ) 2.5 time normal limit allow . - Women childbearing potential must use medically approve method birth control ( condom , birth control pill , Depo-Provera , diaphragm spermicides ) - Signed informed consent - Male female , race ethnic origin Exclusion criterion : - Lifetime history bipolar I , psychotic , cognitive disorder - Actively suicidal , homicidal , psychotic - History sensitivity mirtazapine - Unstable general medical condition - Score 6 Question # 10 MADRS regard suicidal ideation - Women pregnant , plan become pregnant breastfeed study Exit Criteria ( One need exit ) : - Completion study - Severe intolerable side effect mirtazapine/placebo treatment - Acute development suicidal ideation , homicidal ideation psychotic symptom - Symptoms worsen ( Score 7 ( much bad ) CGI-I . - Participant 's explicit request exit study - The need additional psychotropic drug , study drug adjunctive medication specify protocol , control subject psychiatric symptom . - The subject become pregnant course study . - Investigator 's judgment longer best interest patient continue study .</detailed_description>
