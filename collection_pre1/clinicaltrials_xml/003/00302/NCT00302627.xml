	<detailed_description>Pamidronate improve bone mass numerous disorder bone . Other bisphosphonates , well pamidronate , proven beneficial steroid-related bone disorder . Steroid treatment major cause bone loss organ transplantation . Small , short-term study suggest pamidronate prevents bone loss kidney heart transplant recipient . Many bisphosphonates use patient decreased kidney function . However , pamidronate give patient . This advantage pamidronate kidney heart transplantation frequent occurrence decrease kidney function group . Another advantage pamidronate administer intravenously . Oral bisphosphonates commonly produce esophagitis , challenge problem transplant population . Potential side-effects pamidronate include transient hypocalcemia , lymphopenia , low-grade fever , myalgias nausea . Recently , rare case proteinuria kidney failure report cancer patient receive high-dose pamidronate . Although side effect report type patient receive pamidronate , safety concern warrant scrutiny transplant population . In addition bisphosphonate treatment , supplementation calcium vitamin D may preserve bone organ transplantation . Prior study compare bisphosphonates calcium vitamin D regimen . However , combination regimen include treatment may preserve bone mass well single treatment . Data regard treatment combination bisphosphonate , calcium , vitamin D lack kidney heart transplantation . Comparison ( ) : In prospective , open-label , single arm trial , Pamidronate ( 60-90 mg ) administer within 2 week kidney heart transplant every 6 month 2 year . Participants prescribe vitamin D 800 units/d calcitriol 0.25 microgram/d serum creatinine great 2 mg/dl , calcium carbonate 1500 mg/d . The primary outcome bone mineral density measure dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry baseline year 1 2 . Fracture event serum calcium , parathyroid hormone , creatinine , dipstick proteinuria also measure .</detailed_description>
