	<brief_summary>Background : - Radiation therapy temozolomide ( anti-cancer drug ) standard therapy treat brain tumor call glioblastoma . - The drug valproic acid , currently approve treating seizure , show laboratory test increase radiosensitivity glioma cell . Objectives : -To determine effectiveness add valproic acid standard treatment radiation therapy temozolomide treat glioblastoma . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age old glioblastoma multiforme previously treat chemotherapy radiation . Design : - This Phase II trial enroll 41 patient . - Patients receive radiation therapy brain day , Monday Friday , 6 1/2 week . - Patients take temozolomide day mouth , Monday Friday , period radiation treatment . Starting 4 week radiation therapy , patient take temozolomide day 5 day every 28 day total six cycle . - Patients receive valproic acid mouth twice day begin 1 week prior first day radiation therapy continue completion chemotherapy radiation therapy . - Patients follow-up visit 1 month complete therapy , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year . Follow-up include physical examination , blood test magnetic resonance imaging brain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Valproic Acid With Temozolomide Radiation Therapy Treat Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Histone deacetylase inhibitor ( HDACi ) recently show enhance radiosensitivity glioma cell vitro vivo . - Valproic acid also recently demonstrate potent HDAC . - Valproic acid long clinical history patient without brain tumor know cross blood-brain barrier . However , use valproic acid combination temozolomide radiotherapy patient high-grade glioma never test . OBJECTIVES : -The primary measure efficacy progression free survival overall survival . ELIGIBILITY : - Patients great 18 year old - Diagnosis glioblastoma multiforme - Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . - Patients previously treat chemotherapy radiation DESIGN : - This Phase II trial determine efficacy valproic acid combination external beam radiation therapy temozolomide patient high-grade glioma . - Patients treat external beam radiation therapy standard manner temozolomide give daily radiation . The valproic acid administer daily begin one week prior first day irradiation continue completion chemoradiation . - We anticipate accrual trial 41 patient take approximately 1 year .</detailed_description>
