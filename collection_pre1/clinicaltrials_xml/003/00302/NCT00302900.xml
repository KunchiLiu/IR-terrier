	<brief_summary>Many individual experience negative reaction donate blood , include dizziness , lightheadedness , faint . Such reaction may discourage donate . This study evaluate effectiveness pre-donation water consumption muscle tense exercise donation reduce negative reaction among new blood donor . This study also evaluate whether reduce negative reaction increase likelihood donor return give blood future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Negative Reactions First Time Blood Donors Encourage Subsequent Blood Donations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe potentially dangerous shortage blood supply increasingly common United States . As population age stringent donor eligibility restriction enforce , blood shortage expect worsen . One way meet increase demand blood recruit new blood donor . Ideally , individual would become lifelong donor , contribute six time per year hundred unit blood within lifetime . Unfortunately , less half new donor provide second donation . Many individual donate blood experience dizziness , weakness , lightheadedness , severe case , faint . As result negative reaction , many individual never donate blood . Preventing reaction may effective way encourage subsequent blood donation . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness consume water prior donation perform muscle tense exercise donation way reduce negative reaction new blood donor . The study 's long-term goal provide blood collection agency simple inexpensive strategy prevent negative reaction enhance donor retention . This study enroll American Red Cross blood donor donate blood twice previously . Participants randomly assign one follow four group : 1 ) pre-donation water consumption muscle tense exercise donation ; 2 ) pre-donation water consumption ; 3 ) pre-donation muscle tense exercise ; 4 ) treatment . Participant reaction assess time donation self-report phlebotomist rating , well self-report 24 hour follow donation . Participants ' subsequent donation history track two year review American Red Cross national donor database .</detailed_description>
