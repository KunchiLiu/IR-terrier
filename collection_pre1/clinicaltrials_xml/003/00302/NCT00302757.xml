	<brief_summary>The study evaluate additional use radioimmunotherapy 90-Yttrium label monoclonal antibody target lymphoma cell two dose reduce condition regimen allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -identical donor . Radioimmunotherapy allow increase anti-lymphoma effect condition allogeneic graft may confer potent graft versus lymphoma effect rescue potential hematopoietic side effect radioimmunotherapy . The study evaluate feasibility toxicity approach also analyze disease response survival patient treat .</brief_summary>
