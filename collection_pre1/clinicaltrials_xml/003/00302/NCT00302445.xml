	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Evaluate Efalizumab Combination With UVB Moderate Severe Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label , single arm , phase IV study evaluate study efficacy efalizumab combination NB-UVB . After screen , review inclusion exclusion criterion obtain informed consent , 20 subject two site ( 10 subject per site ) enter study . The estimated rate accrual two subject per month per site total five month . The estimated date study conclusion , include follow-up January 2007 . Weeks 1-12 efalizumab administer subcutaneously week combination NB-UVB three time per week . At week 12 , NB-UVB discontinue . Weeks 13-24 efalizumab monotherapy continue determine whether relapse occurs . Relapse define 50 % decrease total improvement PASI score baseline . Weeks 25-36 subject follow safety . Patients transitioned appropriate treatment discretion investigator and/or observe closely . Subjects moderate severe plaque psoriasis often require one therapy treat disease . Because different mechanism action , think combined efalizumab NB-UVB may effective ( percent subject achieve PASI 75 12 week ) rapid onset either treatment alone . This study examine combine efalizumab NB-UVB phototherapy twelve week . Then , NB-UVB discontinue efalizumab continue additional twelve week determine achieve effect combination therapy sustain monotherapy . The follow-up observation period 25-36 week choose permit adequate amount time observe sign disease rebound and/or adverse event discontinuation efalizumab insure subject treat condition appropriately .</detailed_description>
