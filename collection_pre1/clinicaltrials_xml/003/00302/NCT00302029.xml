	<detailed_description>The objective study : ( 1 ) determine prevalence cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection risk factor infection adolescent male ; ( 2 ) prospectively define incidence evaluate risk factor acquisition CMV infection adolescent male ; ( 3 ) provide preliminary data duration magnitude CMV urine , saliva , blood subject seroconvert study . Approximately 1000 male age 12 17 year recruit adolescent clinic Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center , Vanderbilt University , University Texas Medical Branch Galveston order obtain 225 CMV-seronegative subject ( 75 site ) complete Prospective Risk Factor Analysis . Patient participation last minimum 24 month 8 schedule visit prospective seroepidemiology study . Patients seroconvert invited join viral load analysis portion study , consist 8 schedule visit 12 month period . The maximum duration study 36 month , depend time seroconversion entry viral load analysis . The study divide 3 part : Seroprevalence , Prospective Risk Factor Analysis , Prospective Viral Load Analysis . In Seroprevalence portion study , subject complete informed assent parent guardian consent , small amount ( 10 mL ) blood obtain subject evaluation CMV antibody commercial ELISA . Participants give CMV fact sheet . Subjects contact phone result CMV antibody test implication . They give opportunity receive fact sheet discuss information study personnel , desire .
