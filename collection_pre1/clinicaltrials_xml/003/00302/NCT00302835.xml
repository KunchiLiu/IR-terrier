	<detailed_description>Background : The association intake non-phenacetin-containing analgesic occurrence chronic renal failure still controversially discuss . A new epidemiologic study plan conduct Germany Austria . Methods/design : The objective international , multicenter case-control study evaluate association end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) use non-phenacetin-containing analgesic particular emphasis combine formulation . A targeted sample 1000 new ( incident ) dialysis patient , age less 50 year , plan recruit January 1 , 2001 December 31 , 2004 . The age limit choose avoid contamination study population phenacetin-containing analgesic extent possible . Four control subject per ESRD case , match age , sex , region select population live region case come . Lifetime exposure analgesic potential renal risk factor record single face-to-face interview . A set aid introduce reinforce memory study participant . A standardized , pre-tested interview questionnaire ( participant ) , medical documentation sheet ( physicians dialysis centre ) , logbook activity ( dialysis centre ) use collect necessary data . Quality management consist standardized procedure , ( re- ) training supervision interviewer , regular check incoming data completeness plausibility . The study scientifically independent govern international Scientific Advisory Committee bridge gap sponsor company investigator . Also advisory group assist manage committee study . All relevant German Austrian nephrological association support study , study design carefully review approve Kidney Foundation Germany . Discussion : The study expect answer main research question end 2005 . There however high potential various bias try address adequate measure . One limitation however overcome : The methodologically need age-limitation study make easy generalize result age group 50 year . It might suggest repeat study person 50 year 10 year contamination phenacetin use early life likely outgrown .</detailed_description>
