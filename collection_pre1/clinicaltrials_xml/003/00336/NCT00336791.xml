	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To prospectively evaluate predictive accuracy previously discover gene expression profile-based test foretell pathologic complete response ( pCR ) preoperative paclitaxel/FAC ( 5-fluorouracil , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide ) chemotherapy stage I-III breast cancer . 2 . To evaluate genomic predictive test specific paclitaxel/FAC regimen also predict increased sensitivity FAC chemotherapy . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To discover molecular profile associate pCR FAC chemotherapy alone 2 . To establish prospectively collect gene expression profile data bank breast cancer future study 3 . To compare pCR rate patient receive 6 course FAC receive sequential paclitaxel /FAC chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluate Predictive Accuracy Gene Expression Stage I-II Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The new test study measure presence absence 12,000-15,000 human gene cancer use `` DNA chip '' technology . All therapeutic treatment receive part standard care . Only biopsy Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) test investigational . Before chemotherapy , need routine clinical lab test part standard care . These test may include x-ray computed tomography ( CT ) scan liver lung , bone scan mammogram , ultra sonogram breast find extent cancer time diagnosis . Blood test ( 1-2 tablespoon ) perform FAC ( 5-fluorouracil , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide ) FEC ( 5-fluorouracil , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide ) chemotherapy end least every 2 week weekly paclitaxel therapy make sure safe receive treatment . All test part good clinical care consider investigational . During treatment FAC FEC chemotherapy , see physician every 3 week . During weekly paclitaxel treatment see physician every 4-6 week . Additional visit may necessary depend clinical course . During study , ask fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) cancer breast lymph node . The FNA procedure involve insertion small needle tumor suction ( aspirate ) cell cancer 3-4 time one session . A physician train method perform procedure . It could do time diagnosis cancer make may do later time point . The needle aspiration do start chemotherapy cancer . A DNA chip test call transcriptional profiling perform FNA specimens M. D. Anderson Houston ( TX , USA ) . The test do try predict individual likely response paclitaxel/FAC chemotherapy . This study do see accurate test . The chemotherapy response prediction test develop investigator Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. ( Cambridge , MA , USA ) clinical scientist M. D. Anderson . This research may lead development commercial diagnostic test . Only patient need chemotherapy improve chance cure may participate study . Whether would benefit chemotherapy decide physician . During study 18-24 week chemotherapy give surgery . It clear several large clinical study chemotherapy work equally well regardless whether receive breast surgery . By give chemotherapy surgery , researcher study cancer respond well treatment . You may expect 80-90 % time cancer shrink 15-30 % time cancer completely disappear breast lymph node time finish chemotherapy . Many patient experience complete disappearance cancer cure . The purpose research find individual develop test could identify time diagnosis . About 5-10 % patient experience shrinkage cancer may experience growth tumor . If tumor grow treatment , switch another chemotherapy , may receive radiation treatment , may surgery . What best option need decide treat physician . You randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two treatment group . - Participants first group receive weekly treatment chemotherapy drug paclitaxel vein . After completion 12 paclitaxel treatment , receive 4 additional treatment FAC FEC combination chemotherapy . The FAC FEC treatment give every 3 week . You physician decide together FAC FEC appropriate treatment . Both treatment believe equally effective FAC longer treatment require 72-hour infusion whereas FEC give one day . The total length treatment 24 week breast lymph node surgery . - Participants second group receive 6 treatment ( 6 time 3 = 18 week ) FAC FEC surgery . Those patient still cancer breast lymph node time surgery may receive additional chemotherapy surgery paclitaxel similar drug call docetaxel . One large clinical study show addition 4 course paclitaxel 4 treatment AC ( doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide ) chemotherapy improve survival . This reason may recommend receive paclitaxel docetaxel treatment surgery . Whether need additional postoperative chemotherapy need discuss physician . After complete treatment , contact ( phone letter ) every 6 month 10 year find well cancer come back . This research generate large database molecular abnormality find breast cancer . Researchers study presence absence 12,000-15,000 human gene cancer patient participate study . This information along clinical feature cancer store database . The age race patient well long-term outcome treatment also include database . Other information health family history cancer may add database future . However , name , address date birth part research database . The molecular data clinical information use learn cause breast cancer develop best individual therapy future patent . This investigational study . The chemotherapy receive experimental . Paclitaxel , FAC FEC combination commercially available drug approve FDA treat newly diagnose breast cancer . A total 273 patient take part multicenter study . Up 150 may enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

Patients must intact measurable residual cancer ( mammogram , ultra sonogram physical exam ) breast . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine beta Human chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) ) prior initiation chemotherapy . 2 . Patients adequate organ function tolerate chemotherapy . 3 . Patient must willing undergo onetime pretreatment research FNA biopsy 1 . Patients complete lumpectomy , segmental mastectomy modify radical mastectomy , therefore longer measurable cancer leave breast eligible . 2 . Patients stage IV , metastatic breast cancer eligible . 3 . Patients anthracycline paclitaxel chemotherapy contraindicate , example Patients pregnant lactate eligible .</criteria>
