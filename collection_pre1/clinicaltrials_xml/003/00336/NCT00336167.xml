	<brief_title>Bezafibrate Trial CPT2 Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fatty acid main source energy non-glucodependent tissue fast prolonged exercise . Carnitine Palmitoyltransferase ( CPT ) 1 2 key-enzymes regulation mitochondrial FAO , govern entry long-chain fatty acid within mitochondrial matrix . CPT2 deficiency among common inherited disorder mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation ( FAO ) . The neonatal infantile form CPT2 deficiency life-threatening disease hepatocardiomuscular presentation . The adult form present recurrent attack rhabdomyolysis , mostly trigger prolonged exercise , fasting , infection , usually consider `` mild '' disease . However , patient commonly suffers permanent muscle weakness , and/or frequent ( weekly , sometimes daily ) attack rhabdomyolysis , occasionally result severe episode acute renal insufficiency , rarely sudden death . Difference clinical severity distinct form CPT2 deficiency correlate extent vitro data . Thus , measure fibroblast lymphocyte , residual CPT2 activity long-chain fatty acid oxidation ( LCFAO ) usually less 10 % control value neonatal infantile form , often 20 % control adult form . Clinical management CPT2-deficient patient remain poor , often succeed significantly improve clinical condition . Treatment mostly rely far restriction lipid intake limitation fast exercise . We decide year ago set project pharmacological therapy disease , base upon vitro test pharmacological agent potentially able increase residual enzymatic activity CPT2-deficient cell line . Some best `` candidate '' drug PPAR agonist , use since two decade hypolipidemic drug . PPAR alpha transcription factor belong superfamily steroid-thyroid nuclear receptor , show regulate constitutive expression CPT2 gene protein adult mouse heart liver mediate up-regulation CPT2 gene response fibrates mouse liver . We recently show bezafibrate , PPAR alpha agonist , able restore close normal apparent CPT2 activity LCFAO fibroblast culture myoblasts several patient adult form CPT2 deficiency . Therefore , purpose current application test vivo potentially beneficial effect bezafibrate therapy cohort 12 patient adult form disease . All patient clinically manage either 2 research group involve project , namely Neurology department l'hospital Pitié-Salpétrière Genetics department l'hospital Necker-Enfants Malades . Patients fulfil inclusion criterion first submit 6-month period clinical biological survey , write registration clinical symptom , measurement CK activity month . The initial examination include ) muscular testing , ii ) measurement CPT2 activity , LCFAO , quantitation CPT2 transcripts lymphocytes fresh small sample skeletal muscle , iii ) assay acylcarnitines , compound accumulate upstream metabolic block , blood . Bezafibrate thereafter daily supply 400 600 mg dose , accord renal function , 6 month . Follow-up focus muscular symptomatology hepatic , muscular , renal tolerance treatment . At end clinical trial , patient submit examination similar initial one , include second muscle biopsy use measurement CPT2 activity , LCFAO , amount CPT2 transcript . It emphasize , first time , therapy impact directly cause disease ( defective enzyme activity ) consequence ( accumulation cell lipid defective energy production ) .</detailed_description>
