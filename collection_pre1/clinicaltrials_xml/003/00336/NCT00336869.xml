	<detailed_description>Emerging evidence indicate ethnicity-specific difference profile biochemical , metabolic physiological perturbation associate obesity . The implication ethnic difference remain defined . Several epidemiologic study show vascular disease cardiovascular complication , carry significantly high morbidity mortality African Americans compare Caucasians.1-3 These observation may partly explain high prevalence cardiovascular disease risk factor , essential hypertension , diabetes mellitus , tobacco use among African Americans.4-6 However , pathophysiological process underlie racial predisposition fully elucidated.7 It likely etiologic basis ethnic disparity cardiovascular disease multi-factorial involve dynamic gene-environment interaction variance behavior social context critical determinant . The propose Program recognize importance incorporate biological factor social determinant analysis cardiovascular disparity</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Our methodological approach involve random digitdialing crosssectional survey 4000 Metro Atlanta area AA white resident ( age 3065 year ) . This aim focus use wellvalidated survey instrument examine selfreported perception psychosocial stress , neighborhood segregation factor health belief related weight/weight control . These parameter assess relation differential prevalence three major outcome : ( 1 ) selfreported maladaptive cardiovascular behavior predispose obesityrelated CVD ( ie high fat/sodium low fruit/vegetables dietary intake physical inactivity ) ; ( 2 ) obesity ; ( 3 ) hypertension . This study address follow research question : Are observe racial difference maladaptive health behavior ( diet/inactivity ) MetS component ( obesity , hypertension ) associate : ) perceive psychosocial stress , , depression , neighborhood factor health beliefs around weight weight control modify relationship ?</criteria>
