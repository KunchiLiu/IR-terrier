	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare functional outcome recovery follow surgical non surgical treatment potentially unstable , isolated fibula fracture . Secondary objective compare re-operation rate , time union complication two treatment group . The primary research question : 1 . Does surgery provide good functional outcome compare non operative treatment undisplaced , unstable fracture ? 2 . Do patient fracture return activity faster operative non operative treatment ? 3 . Are complication common operative non operative care ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Operative Versus Non Operative Treatment Unstable Ankle Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The controversial ankle fracture Weber B fracture fibular ( lateral malleolar ) fracture begin level ankle mortise extend proximal lateral . This fracture exist isolate fracture lateral malleolus , bimalleolar injury lateral medial malleoli fracture . When malleoli fracture , ankle lose bony support unstable . In contrast , lateral malleolus injure , Weber B injury may either stable unstable . When ankle subluxed dislocated injury , ankle clearly unstable . However , ankle initially subluxed , assessment stability difficult . Stability isolate lateral malleolar fracture depend upon status medial , deltoid , ligament . Further complicate matter , deltoid ligament may intact , partially torn , completely torn spectrum stability injuries.Previous study rely upon assessment tenderness ligament determine instability , may differentiate partial complete tear . In North America , surgeon would agree markedly unstable definitely unstable ankle fracture best treat surgically.Therefore , Weber B fracture involve fracture medial lateral malleolus best treated surgical stabilization . Furthermore , Weber B fracture involve lateral malleolus , present lateral subluxation talus , definitely unstable require fixation . In contrast , controversy exists surgeon regard optimal mean treat undisplaced potentially unstable fibula fracture . Many surgeon recommend routine operative fixation , others recommend routine non-operative treatment.A clear rationale exist type treatment . The important factor treatment include maintain reduction talus within ankle mortise . Even 1 mm displacement lateral shift talus affect ankle joint load lead dysfunction potentially arthritis . Other issue include potential benefit earlier mobilization rehabilitation .</detailed_description>
