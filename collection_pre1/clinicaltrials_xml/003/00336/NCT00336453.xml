	<detailed_description>Influenza identify major health problem young child . Influenza related hospitalization high child le 24 month age child age 24-59 month high rate medical care utilization due influenza . Recently , note death attributable influenza even previously healthy child . Recent CDC recommendation reflect grow awareness impact influenza child state virtually child less 18 year age receive annual influenza vaccination . Currently available license trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIVs ) prepare virus grow embryonated hen ' egg . Alternative substrate vaccine production desirable order reduce vulnerability expand influenza vaccine supply . Recombinant DNA technique allow expression influenza hemagglutinin ( rHA ) baculovirus vector insect cell culture . Advantages technique include speed production , absence egg protein , highly purified product .</detailed_description>
