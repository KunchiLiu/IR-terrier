	<brief_title>Efficacy Prophylactic Itraconazole High-Dose Chemotherapy Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With advance chemoradiotherapy , survival patient , especially child , malignant disease improve . However , prognosis still poor conventional chemotherapy patient advance high-risk tumor diagnosis . Outcome advance high-risk pediatric solid tumor advance neuroblastoma , high-risk brain tumor , recurrent pediatric solid tumor still satisfactory conventional chemotherapy . In context , investigator explore possible efficacy high-dose chemotherapy ( HDCT ) autologous stem cell transplantation ( ASCT ) patient high-risk relapsed pediatric solid tumor . Efficacy HDCT ASCT well demonstrate high-risk neuroblastoma , high-risk brain tumor , recurrent pediatric solid tumor . Therefore , , HSCT ASCT important treatment modality treatment variety pediatric solid tumor poorly respond conventional chemotherapy . However , although HDCT ASCT improve survival patient high-risk tumor , variety clinical issue associate HDCT ASCT present cause significant morbidity even mortality . The frequent cause morbidity associate HDCT ASCT infection . Once high-dose myeloablative chemotherapeutic agent administer , hematopoietic cell bone marrow die prolong marrow aplasia unavoidable even autologous hematopoietic stem cell infusion take time infused stem cell reconstitute sufficient hematopoietic function . In addition , high-dose chemotherapy result severe gastrointestinal mucosal damage facilitate bacterial and/or fungal infection via damage mucosal barrier . Therefore , infection major cause morbidity mortality associate HDCT ASCT . Common pathogens associated infection HDCT ASCT bacteria fungi . To reduce chance infection therefore , reduce morbidity mortality severe infection , various prophylactic antibiotic include antibacterial , antifungal , antiviral agent use accord standard guideline allogeneic stem cell transplantation . However , autologous transplantation solid tumor hematologic recovery rapid immune suppression less severe allogeneic transplantation , standard guideline use prophylactic antibiotic whereas infection important cause morbidity . Standard guideline use prophylactic antifungal agent also available . While institute use anti-fungal agent prophylactically , others use antifungal agent empirically neutropenic fever persist despite empirical use antibacterial agent . HDCT pediatric solid tumor generally intensive , therefore , usually cause severe mucositis adult tumor . Severe mucositis facilitate fungal infection via damage mucosal barrier ( mainly Candida specie ) . Therefore , use prophylactic anti-fungal agent may reduce morbidity mortality associate HDCT ASCT pediatric solid tumor . However , randomize clinical study evaluate efficacy prophylactic use anti-fungal agent date . Itraconazole one newly develop antifungal agent many physician start use itraconazole first-line antifungal agent management neutropenic fever immunocompromised patient . However , efficacy prophylactic itraconazole establish child solid tumor , especially receive HDCT ASCT . In context , go evaluate efficacy prophylactic use itraconazole child high-risk solid tumor HDCT ASCT . `` Prophylactic '' group treat itraconazole ANC fall 500/uL regardless infection `` Empirical '' group treat itraconazole high fever persist despite treatment first-line anti-bacterial agent .</detailed_description>
