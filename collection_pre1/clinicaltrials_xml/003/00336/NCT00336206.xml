	<brief_title>Low Dose Alemtuzumab Consolidation Maintenance Patients With B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fludarabine ( F ) alone combination cyclophosphamide ( FC ) curative treatment patient CLL , patient eventually relapse . Therefore medical need look consolidation follow maintenance therapy able prolong response duration shift anti-tumor therapy induce partial remission complete remission eradicate minimal residual disease complete - still PCR-positive – responder . There standard consolidation therapy available moment role consolidation CLL recently acknowledge research field major importance B-CLL ( Schering global advisory board meeting , Lisbon Nov 2005 ) . Possible treatment option high-dose chemotherapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation ( role however remain uncertain lack worldwide consensus ) monoclonal antibody therapy antigen express CLL cell . Alemtuzumab direct CD52-antigen present high density CLL cell may therefore suitable treatment residual disease . Alemtuzumab show significant remission rate patient fludarabine refractory CLL sub analysis reveal high effectiveness antibody clear CLL cell peripheral blood bone marrow . These finding suggest Alemtuzumab might ideal candidate eliminate minimal residual disease post-remission treatment anti-tumor therapy use maintenance therapy . The efficacy Alemtuzumab consolidation therapy CLL easily measure . There evidence several study treatment Alemtuzumab negative impact stem cell mobilization . Therefore , autologous stem cell transplantation still remain treatment option patient still detectable disease primary cytoreduction follow consolidation therapy Alemtuzumab . Side effect s.c. Alemtuzumab heavily pretreated patient advanced disease tolerable manageable . Data suggest safety profile antibody even favorable less pretreated patient GCLLSG study suggest wash-out period 8 week possibly also low dose necessary avoid severe infectious problem . Campath administration start 2-month wash period Fludarabine show feasible good tolerate . Based collective data obtain pilot phase II study , subcutaneous consolidation dose 30 mg weekly previously treat untreated CLL patient induction Fludarabine combination seem safe effective dose . The propose study aim evaluate efficacy low dose treatment Alemtuzumab regard follow question : Does consolidation therapy low dose Alemtuzumab result prolong time disease progression comparison patient receive treatment ? Is possible turn PR CR ? Does maintenance therapy Alemtuzumab translate progression-free survival benefit compare patient treatment ? How safety profile patient treat low dose Alemtuzumab MRD elimination maintenance therapy ?</detailed_description>
