	<brief_title>PerioWave Re-Treatment Protocol Compared Scaling Root Planing ( SRP ) Single Treatment With PerioWave</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The key question whether scale root planing ( SRP ) follow one two dos photodynamic disinfection use 0.01 % MB result improve outcome persist time adult chronic periodontitis compare subject SRP alone . This study mean pivotal nature evaluation photodynamic disinfection . Primary Endpoint The primary outcome interest study improvement stabilization clinical attachment level . The clinical attachment level distance mm cemento-enamel junction base sulcus periodontal pocket measure periodontal probe . In order prevent study bias endpoint measurement perform single examiner throughout course study . A clinically significant difference consider : 1 ) A measurement difference 0.4 mm treatment group Secondary Endpoints The secondary objective assess effect photodynamic disinfection clinical symptom include reduction probe depth decrease bleed probing .</detailed_description>
