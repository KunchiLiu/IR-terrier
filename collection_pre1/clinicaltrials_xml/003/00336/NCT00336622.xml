	<brief_summary>The purpose randomize clinical trial examine efficacy splint ( fabricate versus off-the-shelf splint ) exercise ( nerve tendon glide versus exercise ) intervention alter clinical course Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ( CTS ) . We hypothesize fabricate splint nerve tendon gliding exercise condition would yield best functional outcome 4 8 week posttesting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Wrist/Hand Splints Tendon/Nerve Gliding Exercises Carpal Tunnel Syndrome : A RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose randomize clinical trial examine efficacy splint exercise intervention alter clinical course Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ( CTS ) . Specifically , aim study test efficacy : ( 1 ) splint , position wrist metacarpal phalange ( MCP ) joint 0 degree conjunction tendon nerve gliding exercise , ( 2 ) splint position wrist MCP joint 0 degree exercise ( 3 ) prefabricate wrist cock splint position wrist 20 degree extension tendon nerve glide exercise , ( 4 ) usual care , prefabricate wrist cock-up splint position wrist 20 degree extension exercise decreasing symptom increase function people clinically diagnose CTS . The specific hypothesis study : ( 1 ) Subjects randomize Experimental Condition 1 perform good Subjects randomize Experimental Condition 2 ; perform good randomize Experimental Condition 3 , turn perform good Subjects randomize Usual Care . In order , Subjects demonstrate : 1 . Significant decrease CTS symptom measure Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Symptom Severity Scale 4 week Posttest compare baseline decrease 8 week Post-Posttest . 2 . Significant decrease upper extremity disability measure Disability Arm , Shoulder , Hand ( DASH ) questionnaire 4 week Posttest compare baseline decrease 8 week Post-Posttest . 3 . Significant increase functional ability measure functional sensibility ( Moberg Pick-Up Test ) , grip strength ( dynamometer ) pinch strength ( pinch meter ) 4 week Posttest compare baseline .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>( 1 ) least 18 year age ; ( 2 ) positive Tinels , Phalens , complaints nocturnal numbness tingling . ( 3 ) English speaking . The exclusion criterion ; ( 1 ) diagnose neuropathy CTS past year ( 2 ) pregnant ( 3 ) steroid injection carpal canal past 3 month ( 4 ) thenar atrophy ( 5 ) prior carpal tunnel release . Pregnant woman exclude study . There increased incidence CTS pregnant woman ; however symptom usually decrease pregnancy . Thus , would difficult determine intervention effective symptom resolve birth child . The physician rule pregnancy patient report . Also , minor include study CTS diagnosis common minor .</criteria>
