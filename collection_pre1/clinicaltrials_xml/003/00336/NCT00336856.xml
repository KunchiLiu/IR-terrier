	<criteria>Patients must consent study Patients must advance , surgically unresectable CRC , fail first line metastatic regimen , within 12 month start protocol therapy . Patients must measurable disease There must histologic confirmation adenocarcinoma colon rectum . Patients must Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 Estimated life expectancy least 12 week . One prior therapy metastatic disease permit . Recurrence within 12 month adjuvant therapy FOLFOX similar regimen ( i.e FLOX , CapOX ) consider one regimen allow study There must evidence adequate organ function Patients history prior noncolorectal malignancy eligible diseasefree ³ 5 year prior study entry deem physician low risk recurrence . Age &gt; 18 yr . Any prior therapy irinotecan cetuximab EGFR target agent . Any systemic therapy administer metastatic locally recurrent colorectal cancer within 28 day study treatment . Patients consider candidate surgical resection metastatic and/or locally advanced disease . Any histology adenocarcinoma colon rectum . Serious concomitant medical condition , opinion investigator , would compromise safety patient compromise patient 's ability complete study . Evidence central nervous system metastases Pulmonary fibrosis interstitial pneumonitis General Medical Concerns History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation result study render subject high risk treatment complication . Serious , uncontrolled , concurrent infection . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior Day 0 , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study ; fine needle aspiration core biopsy within 7 day prior Day 0 . Line placement ( i.e Infusaport PICC ) consider major surgery . Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy Prior severe infusion reaction monoclonal antibody . Significant history uncontrolled cardiac disease ; i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction ( within prior 6 month ) , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy decrease ejection fraction . Patients Gilbert 's Syndrome Prior study enrollment , woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must advise importance avoid pregnancy trial participation potential risk factor unintentional pregnancy . In addition , men enrol study understand risk sexual partner childbearing potential practice effective method birth control . All WOCBP MUST negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior first receive investigational product . If pregnancy test positive , patient must receive investigational product must enrol study . In addition , WOCBP instruct contact Investigator immediately suspect might pregnant ( e.g. , miss late menstrual period ) time study participation . The Investigator must immediately notify BMS event confirm pregnancy patient participate study .</criteria>
