	<brief_title>Study Comparing Safety Efficacy Cethromycin Clarithromycin Treatment Community-Acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower respiratory tract infection remain one leading cause death worldwide . Increasing rate antibiotic resistance newer , pervasive pneumonia-causative pathogen contribute statistic . Currently available macrolide antibiotic treatment community-acquired pneumonia slowly lose effectiveness , result need develop new drug fight resistant infection . In study , compare safety efficacy common macrolide , clarithromycin , new ketolide , cethromycin .</detailed_description>

Other barbiturate may use careful monitoring Subjects currently receive likely require follow medication period Evaluation 1 4 : systemic antibiotic therapy , rifampin rifabutin Immunocompromised subject , subject receive immunosuppressive agent , subject know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection history acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) define condition CD4+ Tlymphocyte count &lt; 200 . Subject know suspected central nervous system ( CNS ) disorder predisposes seizures/lower seizure threshold ( e.g. , severe cerebral arteriosclerosis , epilepsy ) Previous treatment cethromycin Subjects sign septic shock ( e.g. , mental confusion , severe hypoxemia , severe hypotension , condition require intensive care unit [ ICU ] admission )</criteria>
