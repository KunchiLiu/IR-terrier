	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Celecoxib may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor block enzyme need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Celecoxib may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving celecoxib together fluorouracil radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give celecoxib together fluorouracil radiation therapy work treat patient stage II stage III rectal cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine cyclo-oxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) overexpression patient resectable stage II III rectal cancer treat neoadjuvant celecoxib , fluorouracil , radiotherapy . - Determine whether administration celecoxib , COX-2 inhibitor , result change tumor ( COX-2 overexpressing ) level eicosanoids surround normal tissue . - Determine great change protein gene expression post-treatment biopsy compare pretreatment biopsy great tumor ( COX-2 overexpression ) surround normal tissue . - Determine whether patient express great degree change gene protein expression likely respond therapy . - Assess toxicity concurrent treatment celecoxib , fluorouracil , radiotherapy . OUTLINE : This pilot study . Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily begin 5 day prior radiotherapy continue completion radiotherapy . Patients undergo radiotherapy 5 day week 5 week . Patients also receive concurrent fluorouracil IV continuously 5 week . Patients undergo radical resection 4-10 week completion chemoradiotherapy . Patients undergo tumor biopsy baseline time surgical resection . Patients also undergo blood urine collection baseline , 5 day initiation celecoxib , 7 day initiation celecoxib combination fluorouracil radiotherapy , time surgical resection . The specimen evaluate COX-2 expression , eicosanoid production , gene protein expression use immunohistochemistry , microarray , mass spectrometry . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 28 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
