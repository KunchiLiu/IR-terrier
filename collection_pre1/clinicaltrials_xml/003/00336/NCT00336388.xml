	<brief_title>Use Rapid Diagnostic Tests Malaria Case Management Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria cause estimate 300-500 million infection 1 million death per year , predominantly child &lt; 5 year old sub-Saharan Africa . In part malaria endemic sub-Saharan Africa , clinical presumptive diagnosis , often base presence fever , primary mean diagnose malaria . Clinical diagnosis sensitive poorly specific , leading substantial over-diagnosis . Personnel supply perform microscopic examination blood smear person suspect malaria ( current gold standard diagnosis malaria ) available health facility . Over-diagnosis subsequent over-treatment patient result clinical diagnosis lead increase drug pressure may facilitate development drug resistance P. falciparum , malaria parasite responsible associate morbidity mortality sub-Saharan Africa . This may also increase cost , particularly shift inexpensive antimalarial ( chloroquine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ) newer , expensive artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) ( artemether plus lumefantrine , also know Coartem® ) . Over-diagnosis also expose patient unnecessary risk adverse drug event , among patient , leaf real cause illness untreated . Rapid diagnostic test ( RDTs ) use immunochromatographic method detect antigens derive malaria parasite lysed blood . RDTs generally report achieve field sensitivity specificities &gt; 90 % detection Plasmodium falciparum density 100 parasites/μL blood . RDTs easy use interpret , require electricity special equipment , ship store ambient condition . We hypothesize use RDTs improve malaria diagnosis compare use clinical diagnosis alone . Having access test quickly confirm excludes presence malaria parasites enable health care worker ( HCW ) determine whether antimalarial appropriate . If test result use manner , number unneeded antimalarial prescription diminish , thus reduce potential development drug resistance . However , whether HCWs actually use RDT result unknown . Prior research demonstrate result microscopy often ignore , HCWs often rely clinical impression diagnose malaria prescribe treatment . This study seek describe behavior perception associate use RDTs diagnosis malaria among patient &gt; 5 year age health facility Bondo Kericho Districts Kenya , area low high malaria transmission . The specific objective : 1 . To evaluate impact RDTs introduce context newly implement malaria case management guideline use ACTs compare new malaria case management guideline use ACTs clinical diagnosis malaria diagnosis prescribing practice HCWs care patient &gt; 5 year age . 2 . To evaluate HCW performance adherence newly implement guideline use RDTs . 3 . To analyze cost health facility treat patient fever two management strategy ( RDTs + ACTs compare clinical diagnosis + ACTs ) treatment guideline correctly follow base actual HCW adherence new guideline . 4 . To evaluate sensitivity specificity RDTs hand HCWs health facility Kenya compare expert microscopy compare RDTs performance hand train study laboratory technician . 5 . To evaluate factor influence acceptability RDTs HCWs . 6 . To evaluate factor influence acceptability RDTs patient . 7 . To evaluate programmatic implication RDT introduction . This trial generate important public health information regard use RDTs malaria case management . The study finding use guide provider training , development community Information , Education Communication strategy , intervention . These data valuable country sub-Saharan Africa prepare introduction new drug treatment policy consider method improve malaria diagnosis .</detailed_description>
