	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm advanced/metastatic colorectal cancer . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) great 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients must receive prior therapy ( set ) 5FU , CPT11 , oxaliplatin . Patients may receive prior erbitux bevacizumab , require . Patients must receive least one prior chemotherapy regimen advance disease . Tumor must accessible core biopsy begin treatment patient high intratumoral TS expression level prior begin treatment . Age &gt; 18 year . Because dose AE data currently available use vorinostat patient great 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable . Life expectancy &gt; 12 week . ECOG performance status 02 ( Karnofsky &gt; 50 % ; see Appendix A ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; 3,000/µL absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/µL platelet &gt; 100,000/µL hemoglobin &gt; 9 mg/dL total bilirubin within 1.5 x normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) great equal 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine great equal 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 Eligibility patient receive medication substance know affect potential affect activity pharmacokinetics vorinostat determine follow review principal investigator . ( A list medication substance know potential interact select CYP450 isoenzymes provide Appendix B . ) Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . INR ≤ 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless receive therapeutic anticoagulation Patient highly unlikely conceive indicate least one `` yes '' answer follow question : Patient male agree use adequate method contraception duration study , 30 day last dose study medication . Patient surgically sterilize female . Patient postmenopausal female ≥ 45 year age &gt; 2 year since last menses . Patient nonsterilized premenopausal female agree use 2 adequate barrier method contraception prevent pregnancy agree abstain heterosexual activity throughout study 30 day last dose study medication . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover AEs due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent within 28 day study entry . Patients may receive anticancer therapy ( cytotoxic , biologic , radiation , hormonal replacement ) study . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition vorinostat . These compound include sodium butyrate , trichostatin A ( TSA ) , trapoxin ( TPX ) , MS27275 depsipeptide . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study vorinostat HDAC inhibitor agent unknown potential teratogenesis . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother vorinostat , breastfeed discontinue mother treat study therapy . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction vorinostat . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Patient systemic steroid stabilize equivalent ≤ 10 mg/day prednisone 4 week prior start study drug . Patient acute infection require intravenous antibiotic , antiviral , antifungal medication within 2 week prior start study drug . Patient active hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . Patient history GI surgery procedure might , opinion investigator , interfere absorption swallow study drug . Patient prescription nonprescription drug product know influence CYP3A4 discontinue prior day 1 dosing withheld throughout study 2 week last dose study medication . Refer Appendix B list commonly use moderate potent CYP3A4 modifier require washout period . Patient prior cancer treatment HDAC inhibitor ( e.g. , Depsipeptide , MS 275 , LAQ824 , PXD101 , valproic acid ) . Patients receive agent indication , e.g. , epilepsy , may enroll trial 30 day washout period .</criteria>
