	<detailed_description>Introduction : As person age chance develop certain disease harden artery ( atherosclerosis ) , diabetes , depression , osteoporosis memory loss ( Alzheimer 's disease ) increase . One theory might explain age increase risk develop disease involve concept call oxidative stress . Oxidative stress process occur inside cell body . All cell body constantly undergo various biochemical reaction , important cell 's life cycle . Byproducts biochemical reaction molecule call free radical pro-oxidants . Pro-oxidants damage cell lead cell death . Cells also molecules call antioxidant , neutralize pro-oxidants protect cell continue function normally . Oxidative stress occur imbalance pro-oxidants compare antioxidant . Other study show disease harden artery , depression , osteoporosis Alzheimer 's associate elevated level free radical pro-oxidants inside cell . It possible measure level pro-oxidants cell use blood test . Objectives : The purpose study determine reliable reproducible measurement also define `` normal '' value range value healthy people . It hope able define normal range value oxidative stress look people aforementioned disease measure level oxidative stress look correlation two . If show direct correlation level oxidative stress disease begin try develop medicine target area hopefully prevent lessen degree disease . Tests Evaluations In study look healthy participant age 30 old undergo blood test allow u measure marker oxidative stress . Participants also undergo test specifically design look evidence early multi-organ disease . These exam include evaluation lung function ( spirometry test ) , exercise capacity ( use stationary bike ) , bone density scan look osteoporosis , ultrasound artery neck ( carotid ) artery arm ( brachial ) , nerve conduction study , bio-impedance ( Body fact composition ) several questionnaire assess memory mood . The participant require one screen visit follow visit undergo test .
