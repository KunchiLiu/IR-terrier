	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy major cause visual impairment United States . Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) manifestation diabetic retinopathy produce loss central vision . Data Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study Diabetic Retinopathy ( WESDR ) estimate 15 year know diabetes , prevalence diabetic macular edema approximately 20 % patient type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , 25 % patient type 2 DM take insulin , 14 % patient type 2 DM take insulin . In review three early study concern natural history diabetic macular edema , Ferris Patz find 53 % 135 eye diabetic macular edema , presumably involve center macula , lose two line visual acuity two year period . In Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) , 33 % 221 untreated eye available follow-up 3-year visit , edema involve center macula baseline , experience 15 letter decrease visual acuity score ( equivalent double visual angle , e.g. , 20/25 20/50 , term `` moderate visual loss '' ) . In ETDRS , focal photocoagulation ( direct treatment microaneurysms grid treatment diffuse edema ) eye clinically significant macular edema ( CSME ) reduce risk moderate visual loss approximately 50 % ( 24 % 12 % , three year initiation treatment ) . Therefore , 12 % treated eye develop moderate visual loss spite treatment . Furthermore , approximately 40 % treated eye retinal thicken involve center macula baseline still thicken involve center 12 month , 25 % treated eye 36 month . Although several treatment modality currently investigation , demonstrate mean reduce risk vision loss diabetic macular edema laser photocoagulation , demonstrate ETDRS , intensive glycemic control , demonstrate Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) blood pressure control , demonstrate UKPDS . In DCCT , intensive glucose control reduce risk onset diabetic macular edema 23 % compare conventional treatment . Long-term follow-up patient DCCT show sustain effect intensive glucose control , 58 % risk reduction development diabetic macular edema DCCT patient follow Epidemiology Diabetes Interventions Complications Study . The frequency unsatisfactory outcome respect proportion vision improvement follow laser photocoagulation eye diabetic macular edema prompt interest treatment modality . One treatment par plana vitrectomy . These study suggest vitreomacular traction , vitreous , may play role increase retinal vascular permeability . Removal vitreous relief mechanical traction vitrectomy membrane stripping may follow substantial resolution macular edema correspond improvement visual acuity . However , treatment may applicable specific subset eye diabetic macular edema component vitreomacular traction contribute edema . It also require complex surgical intervention inherent risk , recovery time , expense . Other treatment modality pharmacologic therapy oral protein kinase C inhibitor use intravitreal corticosteroid investigation . The use antibody target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , current study , another treatment modality generate considerable interest , currently investigate phase 3 trial choroidal neovascularization age-related macular degeneration ( pegaptanib ranibizumab ) diabetic macular edema ( pegaptanib ) . Increased VEGF level demonstrate retina vitreous human eye diabetic retinopathy . VEGF , also know vascular permeability factor , demonstrated increase vessel permeability increase phosphorylation tight junction protein , show increase retinal vascular permeability vivo model . Anti-VEGF therapy , therefore , may represent useful therapeutic modality target underlie pathogenesis diabetic macular edema . Bevacizumab currently approve treatment metastatic colorectal cancer , publish case report widespread clinical use suggest efficacy treatment neovascular age-related macular degeneration macular edema associate diabetes central retinal vein occlusion . To date , evidence ocular inflammation adverse event note association intravitreal injection bevacizumab . However , study conduct evaluate efficacy safety . In view widespread use bevacizumab , study important conduct . From public health perspective , intravitreal bevacizumab study also important conduct relatively low cost bevacizumab drug . As noted early , bevacizumab market systemic use colon cancer . The dose use eye fraction systemic dose cost $ 25 $ 50 per dose . The two dos bevacizumab evaluate study 1.25 mg , dose commonly used clinical practice , 2.5 mg , also use though less commonly . A low dose 1.25 mg would create difficulty dilution accuracy injection small volume . The optimal interval bevacizumab dose know . Six week select study believe effect last longer . Retinal thicken visual acuity measure 3 6 week provide requisite information judge duration effect . There expect beneficial cumulative effect multiple dos . A total two dos , space 6 week apart , select study primary outcome 3 week second dose . The decision whether proceed phase 3 trial base observation substantial reduction retinal thicken bevacizumab-treated eye compare laser-treated eye least suggestion benefit visual acuity , plus safety profile minimal risk . Description : The study involve enrollment subject 18 year age diabetic macular edema . Subjects one study eye randomly assign equal probability ( stratify visual acuity ) one 5 treatment group : Laser photocoagulation baseline 1.25 mg intravitreal injection bevacizumab baseline 6 week 2.5 mg intravitreal injection bevacizumab baseline 6 week 1.25 mg intravitreal injection bevacizumab baseline ( sham injection 6 week ) 1.25 mg intravitreal injection bevacizumab baseline , laser photocoagulation 3 week , intravitreal injection 1.25 mg bevacizumab 6 week Follow-up include 10 visit 4 day , 3 week , 6 week , 4 day follow 6 week , 9 week , 12 week , 18 week , 24 week , 41 week 70 week . At visit , visual acuity ocular exam complete eye , OCT perform study eye ( except 4-day visit ) . During first 12 week , treatment DME give . During week 13-24 , treatment depend response treatment give first 12 week . After 24 week , follow-up safety treatment investigator 's discretion .</detailed_description>

Able willing provide inform consent . EXCLUSION A subject eligible follow exclusion criterion ( 413 ) present : 4 . Significant renal disease , define history chronic renal failure require dialysis kidney transplant . 5 . A condition , opinion investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure , cardiovascular disease , glycemic control ) . 6 . Participation investigational trial within 30 day randomization involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry . 7 . Known allergy component study drug . 8 .
