	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : 1 . To assess resectability rate patient undergo gemcitabine plus Avastin-based chemoradiation follow pancreaticoduodenectomy adenocarcinoma pancreas . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To assess disease free survival overall survival 2 . To assess margin resection rate ( R0 vs. R1 ) patient 3 . To assess pattern failure</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine design disrupt growth cancer cell , cause cancer cell start die . Avastin design prevent slow growth tumor damage effect blood vessel growth tumor . Before treatment start , complete physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) drawn test , urine test perform . Chest x-rays compute tomography ( CT ) scan abdomen do . Women able child must negative blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , receive gemcitabine week , Avastin every 2 week , radiation 5 time week . Gemcitabine Avastin give Saturdays , radiation give Monday Friday week . You receive treatment outpatient 6 week . You receive gemcitabine needle vein Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 ( +/- 2 day ) . You receive Avastin needle vein every 2 week Days 1 , 15 , 29 ( +/- 2 day ) . On day receive drug , receive Avastin 30-90 minute gemcitabine 40 minute . The first dose Avastin give 90 minute . If reaction ( fever/chills ) , next dose give 60 minute , reaction occurs , dose give 30 minute . If experience reaction Avastin infusion , may give acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) mouth and/or diphenhydramine ( Benadryl ) vein 30 minute dose decrease risk reaction . Radiation give Monday Friday 5 1/2 week . Each day treatment , lie treatment table . The radiation therapist help position body radiation go right place . A machine deliver radiation . It take 15-20 minute receive radiation treatment day . If day radiation miss , day make end treatment ( end 28 day ) receive full amount radiation . During study , physical exam weekly receive chemoradiation , every week receive chemotherapy surgery , every 4 month follow-up period . You blood draw ( 1-2 tablespoon time ) routine test weekly basis receive chemoradiation , every week take Avastin surgery 3 month , every 4 month follow-up period . The possible development side effect closely monitor could require extra blood and/or urine sample . You may also physical exam , blood urine test , x-ray , scan complete chemoradiation part study , depend upon medically need evaluation ongoing therapy . The overall effect treatment evaluate least 8 week ( +/- 2 day ) completion chemoradiation . A chest x-ray CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis perform , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Some participant surgery remove part pancreas , need . The reason wait least 8 week allow safe period time pas last dose Avastin prevent bleeding surgery . It may also help decrease risk postoperative complication , include bleed poor wound heal . This research study allow participant receive 3 infusion Avastin chemoradiation part study . If treatment show benefit , doctor may continue give additional infusion Avastin every 2 week ( +/- 2 day ) 3 month surgery . After Avastin treatment , chest x-ray , abdominal CT scan , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test every 4 month surgery 2 year check status tumor . This investigational study . The study drug commercially available FDA approve , use together radiation experimental . Avastin FDA approve colon lung cancer evaluate FDA pancreatic cancer . Gemcitabine FDA approve pancreatic cancer . Avastin provide free charge study , however cost infusion drug responsibility and/or insurance company . The cost gemcitabine radiation consider standard care , responsibility and/or insurance company . Up 31 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
