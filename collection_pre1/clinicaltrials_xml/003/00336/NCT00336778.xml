	<brief_summary>We hypothesize simple bridging ARV regimen tend select virus low replicative capacity may tend stabilize CD4 cell count HIV viral load might option consider patient MDR HIV . This strategy provide bridge desperately need await development new therapy use combination give best chance achieve complete virologic suppression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Pilot Study ART Bridging Regimen Highly Experienced Patients Unable Achieve Viral Suppression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bridge pilot , single-arm , open-label , study assess ability 3 FDA approve anti-retroviral drug decrease replication capacity HIV virus order stabilize CD4 cell count HIV RNA viral load . All subject prescribe three-drug combination lamivudine ( 3TC ) + tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) + nelfinavir ( NLV ) The `` Bridge Study '' pilot , study assess ability 3 FDA approve anti-retroviral drug decrease replication capacity HIV virus order stabilize CD4 cell count HIV RNA viral load . All subject receive three-drug combination lamivudine ( 3TC ) +tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) +nelfinavir ( NLV ) The study enroll 12 subject 48 week study . Major entry criterion include : HIV+ Men woman 18 year age currently fail antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy HIV-1 RNA VL &gt; 10,000 fail multiple treatment regimen due resistance and/or intolerance . Genotype must demonstrate resistance 3 major class ARV 's - PI 's , NNRTI 's , NRTI 's .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Men woman age &gt; 18 year age . 2 . Ability willingness give write informed consent . 3 . HIV1 infection document licensed ELISA test kit confirm either Western blot , HIV1 culture , HIV1 antigen , plasma HIV1 RNA , second antibody test method ELISA prior study entry . 4 . Patient fail multiple treatment regimen due development viral resistance/and intolerance . 5 . Patient 's provider feel patient exhaust currently available treatment option highly unlikely regimen ( include one contain T20 ) could construct would result sustained virologic suppression time . 6 . Evidence MDR virus ( broad 3 class resistance ) base result MDRHIV qualify screen genotypic resistance test history previous genotypic resistance test . 7 . The follow screening laboratory value obtain within 30 day prior study entry : HIV1 RNA BDNA &gt; 10,000 copies/mL 1 . Active drug alcohol abuse dependence , opinion investigator , would interfere adherence study requirement . 2 . History illness , opinion study investigator , might confound result study pose additional risk administer study drug subject . 3 . Acute therapy serious infection serious medical illness potentially life threaten require systemic therapy and/or hospitalization . NOTE : Subjects serious infection serious medical illness must complete acute therapy least 7 day prior study entry . Subjects infection medical illness ( e.g. , vaginitis , folliculitis , bronchitis , pharyngitis , thrush ) must receive appropriate therapy prior study entry ( time restriction ) . 4 . Significant Renal Insufficiency calculate creatinine clearance &lt; 50 5 . Upon review medication history genotypic resistance testing , study investigator feel would inappropriate enroll patient protocol .</criteria>
