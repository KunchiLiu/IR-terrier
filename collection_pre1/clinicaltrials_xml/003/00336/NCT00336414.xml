	<brief_title>Five-Year Actively Controlled Clinical Trial New Onset Juvenile Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Nephritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific objective : The propose project aim improve treatment approach rare , severe disable paediatric rheumatic disease ( PRD ) . This goal achieve Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation ( PRINTO ) international network whose main function provide scientific base current PRD treatment evidence base data exist literature , drug support industry . This 5-year project , involve 185 partner 46 country ( 110 21 EU States 75 25 extra-EU States ) , randomise clinical trial ( RCT ) juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus ( JSLE ) : 5-year phase III single-blind , RCT child newly diagnose , WHO class III , IV JSLE proliferative nephritis : PDN oral cyclophosphamide ( CYC ) versus high dose intravenous ( iv ) CYC versus intermediate dose iv CYC , follow maintenance azathioprine . The JSLE RCT aim find treatment regimen associate low occurrence flare low drug relate toxicity . The retention treatment use main measure effectiveness . Methodology : The present protocol natural follow previous work conduct PRINTO . In particular RCT foreseen protocol model successful completion early phase trial MTX juvenile idiopathic arthritis , use validate JSLE outcome measure evaluation response therapy . It basic premise protocol , without ) involvement international paediatric rheumatology community , ii ) innovative type mechanism describe herein , study would never conduct . Objectives . The goal current protocol therefore natural follow-up objective achieve previous grant , particular , project design discern new model successful conduct clinical trial child rare disease , develop standardize validated measure evaluation response therapy JSLE . The propose trial JSLE ( oral cyclophosphamide [ CYC ] versus intermediate dose intravenous [ iv ] CYC versus high dose iv CYC ) follow maintenance therapy azathioprine [ AZA ] ) , serve model successful run early phase clinical trial severe disable rare disease childhood . The ultimate aim trial provide evidence-based information clinical utility drug management rare paediatric condition .</detailed_description>
