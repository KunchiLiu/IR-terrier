	<brief_title>The Erythropoietin NeuroProtective Effect : Assessment CABG Surgery ( TENPEAKS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass surgery ( CABG ) perform year 500,000 patient US almost 30,000 patient Canada treat coronary artery disease . However , complicate significant postoperative risk neurologic sequela , include stroke neurocognitive dysfunction ( NCD ) . Clinically overt stroke , may see 1-4 % patient , far less common NCD , report approximately 50-75 % patient discharge , 20-50 % 6 week 40 % five years.Human recombinant erythropoietin ( rh-Epo ) approve population prophylactic use reduce blood transfusion , become agent intense interest neuroprotection result vitro data , animal experiment , , two promise preliminary trial human patient . There , however , pilot data estimate appropriate dose treatment effect rh-Epo NCD specifically . It imperative refine estimate control group incidence rate , treatment effect test variability CABG , well demonstrate feasibility safety study protocol , prior embark large randomize control trial power adequate sample size investigate efficacy rh-Epo reduction peri-operative NCD . We propose six month prospective study CABG patient investigate feasibility safety three prophylactic dos human recombinant erythropoietin ( rh-Epo ) randomize , placebo control study . The four study arm : placebo , 375 U/kg , 750 U/kg , 1500 U/kg human recombinant erythropoietin intravenously divide three dos , day , day day surgery . The primary outcome pilot study feasibility patient safety measure ICU Hospital length stay , 28 day cause mortality , incidence morbidity include pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) , stroke , myocardial infarction , re-operation , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary thromboembolism . The secondary outcome incidence neurocognitive dysfunction among four study arm placebo rh-Epo dose . As well , little known pharmacology rh-Epo cross blood-brain barrier . In patient receive spinal anesthetic addition general anesthetic part normal care , CSF analyze rh-Epo concentration , compare drug dose serum level .</detailed_description>
