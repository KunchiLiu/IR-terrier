	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together azacitidine treat patient nasopharyngeal cancer nasal natural killer T-cell lymphoma recur ( come back ) near place original ( primary ) tumor , usually period time cancer could detect spread part body . Drugs use chemotherapy , vorinostat azacitidine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Vorinostat azacitidine also may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving vorinostat together azacitidine may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Define toxicity profile escalate dos suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid ( SAHA ) give conjunction fix dose 5 Azacytidine ( 5AC ) ( azacitidine ) patient locally recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma natural killer ( NK ) -T cell nasal lymphoma . II . Define biologically optimal dose SAHA give conjunction fix dose 5AC patient locally recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma NKT cell nasal lymphoma base evidence Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) lytic induction tumor biopsy plasma . III . Study effect 5AC pharmacokinetic SAHA patient locally recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma NK-T cell nasal lymphoma . IV . Assess effect SAHA histone acetylation measure tumor peripheral blood mononuclear cell patient locally recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma NK-T cell nasal lymphoma V. Assess effect 5AC EBV promoter demethylation measure tumor patient locally recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma NK-T cell nasal lymphoma . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study vorinostat ( SAHA ) . Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-10 vorinostat orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond disease may continue treatment discretion principal investigator . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SAHA maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine .</detailed_description>
