	<brief_summary>Mastocytosis disorder characterize presence excessive number mast cell skin , bone marrow internal organ . It affect child adult , male females individual ethnic background , although precise demographic information affect population available rare disorder . Mastocytosis child generally limited skin follow self limited course , disorder hematopoietic stem cell associate somatic mutation c-kit gene patient adult-onset disease . There know curative therapy patient systemic mastocytosis . Recent research study identify several subtypes disease distinct clinical pathologic feature , however , precise understanding incidence well molecular pathology different disease subtypes lack . This study aim examine molecular cellular pathological aspect disease patient mastocytosis correlate finding clinical presentation prognosis . Patients undergo routine history physical examination , diagnostic test order dictated patient 's clinical presentation . Blood bone marrow obtain diagnostic research purpose . Genetic analysis c-kit gene regulate mast cell growth differentiation perform . It hop finding obtain study help design novel therapy mastocytosis disorder mast cell play critical role .</brief_summary>
