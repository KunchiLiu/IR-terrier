	<brief_summary>Rationale : Standard therapy anaplastic oligodendrogliomas mixed oligoastrocytomas include radiation chemotherapy . However , due potential long-term central nervous system toxicity radiation , researcher speculate may better reserve radiation therapy progressive disease . In addition , patient anaplastic oligodendroglioma mixed oligoastrocytoma unusually chemosensitive tumor . Previous research indicate brain tumor patient deletion 1p chromosome high response chemotherapy drug temozolomide .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Patients With Newly Diagnosed Anaplastic Oligodendroglioma Mixed Oligoastrocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Temozolomide demonstrate clinical antitumor efficacy malignant glioma relapse initial diagnosis . This drug appear less adverse effect compare drug use brain tumor . Therefore , temozolomide often well tolerated brain tumor patient compare brain tumor drug . The current study build previous research test efficacy chemotherapy alone patient anaplastic oligodendroglioma mixed oligoastrocytoma . Purpose : This study evaluate response rate , disease size change patient , survival without disease growth , patient anaplastic oligodendroglioma mixed oligoastrocytoma treat temozolomide . Quality life also assess patient population treat study regimen . Treatment : Study participant treat drug temozolomide . This drug administer oral pill . Temozolomide take seven consecutive day follow seven day without drug . This treatment schedule seven day temozolomide follow seven day continue throughout study . Several test exams give closely monitor patient . MRI scan perform every 8 week measure disease response . Temozolomide study drug give study participant total 8 week four cycle . However , treatment discontinue due disease growth unacceptable adverse event .</detailed_description>
