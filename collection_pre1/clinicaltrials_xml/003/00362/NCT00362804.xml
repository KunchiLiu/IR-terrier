	<detailed_description>Since 1950 's , antipsychotic use mainstay treatment control symptoms schizophrenia . However , soon introduction become apparent substantial number individual show less optimal response drug - many 30 % schizophrenic use conventional antipsychotic derive little benefit . Furthermore , 'atypical ' generation antipsychotic clozapine prove beneficial partial responder represent cornerstone treatment-resistant schizophrenia , offer response rate low 30 % show inadequate response . Moreover , many individual decline clozapine option , tolerate . For reason , augmentation strategy play important role treatment antipsychotic partial responder . We systematically review different augmentation option , reach conclusion strategy theoretically speculative empirically unsupported . At time though , recognize augmentation strategy common practice clinical setting . With many individual show partial response antipsychotic treatment ( typical atypical ) , become practical reality effort offer improvement . Often , come form add one even antipsychotic , although evidence approach less compelling neuroimaging centre caution approach . With variety potential augmentation strategy available , chosen focus tetrabenazine ( TBZ ) , currently license Canada management hyperkinetic movement disorder . The choice TBZ augmentation strategy arise several line investigation : - TBZ , like reserpine , pre-synaptic monoamine-depleting agent inhibitor vesicular monoamine transporter , hence act dampen abnormal dopamine release patient already primary post-synaptic D2 block compound , case ( vary degree ) antipsychotic currently available . - There anecdotal report reserpine , indicate augment response patient show partial response antipsychotic ( atypical , well typical ) partial responder . - TBZ appear low-affinity post-synaptic D2 effect , still well 80 % threshold one begin see motor side effect . - TBZ inherent anti-dyskinetic property , thereby offer additional secondary benefit . We propose carry control double-blind trial , use TBZ off-label patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder partially responsive antipsychotic . We feel choice approach empirically sound , fact , offer advantage common approach add several antipsychotic . Our decision maintain focus dopaminergic system arise grow body evidence dopamine blockade , particularly level D2 receptor , central antipsychotic activity , combination lack current evidence support distinct advantage incorporate system . Given limit success augmentation strategy schizophrenic patient date , evidence efficacy safety combination add considerably option might consider clinical setting . This information could also prove useful shape investigation related pharmacology schizophrenia development future compound .</detailed_description>
