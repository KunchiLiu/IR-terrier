	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Azilsartan Medoxomil Participants With Mild Moderate Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension affect approximately 50 million individual United States . As population age , prevalence hypertension continue increase broad effective preventive measure implement . Data Framingham Heart study suggest lifetime risk develop hypertension among 55- 65-year-old individual great 90 % . According World Health Organization , hypertension common attributable cause preventable death develop nation , uncontrolled hypertension greatly increase risk cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure . Despite availability hypertension treatment , hypertension remain inadequately control ; one third patient continue maintain control successfully . To help address matter , Seventh Report Joint National Committee Prevention , Detection , Evaluation , Treatment High Blood Pressure propose aggressive intervention hypertension management potent antihypertensive agent combination therapy . Takeda Global Research &amp; Development Center , Inc. develop TAK-491 ( azilsartan medoxomil ) treat mild moderate essential hypertension . Azilsartan medoxomil prodrug rapidly hydrolyze activity moiety , azilsartan , angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist . This study propose evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability multiple dos azilsartan medoxomil five dose level subject mild moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension . Individuals want participate study require provide write informed consent . Study participation anticipate 11 week . Multiple procedure occur visit may include fasting , blood collection , urine collection , vital sign include sit stand blood pressure pulse , body height weight , physical examination , electrocardiogram Outside study center , participant require wear ambulatory blood pressure monitoring device approximately 24 36 hour interval .</detailed_description>
