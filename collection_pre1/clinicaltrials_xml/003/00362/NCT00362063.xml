	<brief_summary>The purpose propose study investigate effect rhGH treatment glucose , protein fat metabolism GHD child . Specifically , investigator measure rate glucose production , gluconeogenesis , glycogenolysis , insulin sensitivity glucagon response treatment rhGH . In addition , investigator study change protein fat metabolism pre post rhGH therapy child GHD . The finding GHD child compare control group age sex match healthy child . Hypotheses : H1- The fraction glucose derive gluconeogenesis decrease glycogenolysis increase post-absorptive state untreated GHD child compare healthy child . H2- Treatment rhGH change overall glucose turnover normalize abnormal partition gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis GHD child . H3- GH replacement reduce urea production increase estimate protein synthesis , thus optimize availability amino acid growth . H4- Untreated child GHD overnight fast increased glucagon challenge response decrease 8 week treatment rhGH . Specific Aims : In healthy newly diagnose GHD child investigator : 1 . Measure Glucose Production Rate ( GPR ) 2 . Determine fraction glucose derive gluconeogenesis glycogenolysis 3 . Estimate insulin sensitivity 4 . Measure proteolysis protein oxidation 5 . Determine glucagon challenge response overnight fast . The above-mentioned parameter re-evaluated child GHD 8 week rhGH therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Growth Hormone Glucose Protein Metabolism Children With Growth Hormone Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) increase insulin sensitivity may present hypoglycemia infancy . Treatment recombinant human growth hormone ( rhGH ) reduce risk hypoglycemia decrease insulin sensitivity . The investigator hypothesize , GHD cause decrease fraction glucose derive form gluconeogenesis conversely glycogenolysis insulin sensitivity increase , GHD child compare healthy control . The investigator anticipate total glucose production unaffected rhGH therapy . Therefore , GDH subject treat rhGH 8 week increase fraction glucose derive form gluconeogenesis decrease form glycogenolysis decrease insulin sensitivity . To test hypothesis , 10 healthy 10 GHD child study use stable isotope [ U-13C ] glucose Mass Isotopes Distribution Analysis ( MIDA ) . The investigator specifically measure rate glucose production , gluconeogenesis , glycogenolysis , insulin sensitivity glucagon response overnight fast . In addition , investigator measure change protein oxidation , proteolysis fat metabolism use stable isotope [ 15N2 ] urea , [ 1-13C ] leucine concentration free fatty acid b-hydroxybutyrate . The GHD group study time diagnosis 8 week rhGH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The study population consist child newly diagnose growth hormone deficiency ( GHD ) , age 117 year . The clinical evidence provide one follow criterion : delay bone age , growth deceleration , short stature ( 2 SD bellow mean subject 's age ) and/ height than1.5 SD predict midparental height . The biochemical diagnosis GHD establish abnormal growth hormone stimulation test low IGF1 IGFBP3 ( growth factor ) . The growth hormone stimulation test perform follow standard Endocrinology Clinic protocol . The growth hormone stimulation test consider `` gold standard '' diagnose Growth Hormone Deficiency . This test part standard clinical practice diagnose GHD . An abnormal test define post stimulation Growth Hormone level less than10 ng/mL . The control group include healthy child age 117 year , take medication normal weight height growth factor ( IGF1 IGFBP3 ) . '' The exclusion criterion include group age less 1 17 y/o , evidence anemia ( hemoglobin less tan 12 mg/dl ) , use medication directly impact blood sugar ( steroid , oral contraceptive etc ) , history proof chemical abuse , lack supportive family environment , allergies local anesthetic elevate liver enzymes . The GHD child head MRI , child evidence tumor space occupy lesion exclude . GHD subject adrenal insufficiency hypothyroidism . consider study .</criteria>
