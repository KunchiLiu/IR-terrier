	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , Gliadel wafer O6-benzylguanine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give Gliadel wafer together O6-benzylguanine work treat patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gliadel Wafer O6-Benzylguanine Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Define activity Gliadel® wafer combination 5-day infusion O6-benzylguanine patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . - Define toxicity Gliadel® wafer combination 5-day infusion O6-benzylguanine patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients undergo surgical resection tumor follow placement Gliadel® wafer . Within 6 hour completion surgery , patient receive 1 hour high dose infusion O6-benzylguanine follow low dose continuous infusion 5 day . Every 48 hour repeat infusion high dose 1 hour administer total 3 dos . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS Histologically confirm recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( include gliosarcoma ) confirm , earlier , intraoperative pathological diagnosis frozen section Evidence unilateral , single focus measurable Central Nervous System ( CNS ) neoplasm contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan supratentorial measure ≥ 1.0 cm diameter PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS Greater equal 18 year old Life expectancy great 12 week Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 % Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,000/millimeters ( mm ) ³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Total Serum Bilirubin &lt; 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) &lt; 3 time ULN Blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) &lt; 1.5 time ULN Creatinine &lt; 1.5 time ULN Negative pregnancy test Recovered effect major surgery Patients legal guardian must give write , informed consent . PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY At least 2 week since prior surgical resection ( conduct ) recover , unless unequivocal evidence tumor progression At least 4 week since prior radiotherapy chemotherapy ( 6 week nitrosoureas ) , unless unequivocal evidence tumor progression.. However , patient treat chemotherapeutic agent etoposide would normally retreat short interval ( eg , 21 day , 7 day schedule ) may treat usual starting time even less 4 week last prior dose chemotherapy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients recover surgery Patients neurologically stable 2 week prior study entry Patients poor medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease well acute infection treat intravenous antibiotic Frequent vomit medical condition could interfere oral medication intake ( e.g. , partial bowel obstruction ) Patients history another primary malignancy currently clinically significant currently require active intervention Known HIV positivity AIDSrelated illness Pregnant nursing woman Women childbearing potential use effective method contraception . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test 24 hour prior administration study drug practice medically approve contraceptive precaution . Men advise use effective method contraception Patients take immunosuppressive agent prescribed corticosteroid Patients prior treatment Gliadel Wafers .</criteria>
