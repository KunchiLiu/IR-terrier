	<brief_summary>The management pain endure patient skin graft complex . Pain single distress symptom difficult manage , often under-treated . These patient may experience pain two type wound : original injury `` skin-donor '' site , area healthy skin skin surgically remove use cover original injury . As section skin remove standardized , wound create donor site uniform provide model acute wound . Opioids ( morphine ) backbone treat moderate severe pain experienced patient . But due potentially severe side effect patient experience sufficient relief treatment , optimal treatment schedule still seek . Topically applied morphine provide effective safe analgesia several clinical model . We , therefore , wish apply treatment modality onto skin-graft donor wound . If find effective could appeal non-invasive method treat pain type wound .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Administration morphine knee joint best-studied clinical procedure document use topically-applied opioids . When 1-5 mg morphine inject knee joint , patient experience pain relief 24 hour , whereas similar dos give systemically ( i.e . intravenously ) effective 2-4 hour . Furthermore , analgesic effect reverse opioid antagonist naloxone inject knee joint . Both finding indicate effect mediate local opioid receptor knee joint . Peripheral analgesic effect opioids detectable normal tissue appear minute hour initiation inflammation . This suggest opioid receptor already present peripheral nerve terminal normal condition functional . Research application opioids skin wound sparse primarily perform palliative care patient . These report demonstrate topical opioid gel ( morphine diamorphine ) provide rapid effective relief . In patient pain subside within 20 minute application long-lasting ( 7-8 hour ) effect . Fundamental aspect regard topical application opioids onto skin wound still lack . For example , issue optimal dose dose-effect relationship investigate . We hope determine study .</detailed_description>
