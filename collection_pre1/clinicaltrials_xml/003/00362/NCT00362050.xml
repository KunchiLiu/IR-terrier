	<brief_summary>The trial identify best dose synthetic peroxide RBx11160 treat uncomplicated malaria . Patients treat 7 day daily dose 50 , 100 200 mg RBx11160 . The study design assess antimalarial activity safety 3 dose level RBx 11160 administer daily 7 consecutive day . The primary endpoint time 90 % parasite clearance . In future regulatory study , RBx 11160 likely administer combination another antimalarial agent since development plan follow current recommendation WHO treatment uncomplicated malaria . However , critical gather data RBx 11160 use monotherapy adult patient suffer acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria . In malaria-endemic region , adult population define basis immune status rather legal age consent . Thus , patient young 13 year age enrol provided consent obtain legal guardian accordance local practice regulation . This study conduct compliance International Conference Harmonization ( ICH ) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RBx11160 Phase II Dose Ranging Study RBx/MMV05-06</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , double-blind , multicenter , randomize , parallel-group , dose-ranging study antimalarial activity safety 3 ( 50 , 100 , 200 mg ) RBx 11160 dose level administer single dose orally 7 consecutive day patient acute uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria ( mono-infection ) . At least 255 patient randomize 4 study site South East Asia , India Africa . Each investigational site enroll 60 90 patient yield approximately 65 `` per protocol '' patient treatment arm . Patients randomize 1 3 dose group . Patients administer RBx 11160 match placebo tablet require maintain study blind . The study divide 3 main period include Pre-Treatment Period ( Screening/Day 0 ) , Treatment Period ( Days 0 6 ; Day 0 first day study medication dose ) , Post-Treatment Period ( Day 14 +/- 1 day ; Day 21 +/- 1 day ; Day 28 +/- 2 day ) . Patient participation least 28 ( ± 2 ) day follow first dose study medication . Patients hospitalize least 4 day ( Days 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) , may remain hospital live vicinity study site study duration . If patient discharge hospital Day 3 , he/she return study site authorize study staff member visit patient Days 4 5 administer study medication perform indicate assessment . The patient return study site study visit Days 6 ( last dose study medication administration ) , 14 , 21 , 28 . If adverse event report study unresolved Day 28 , patient follow additional 30 day resolution event determination medical management deem necessary . Similarly , investigator instruct patient return study site untoward event occur within 30 day complete study medication .</detailed_description>
