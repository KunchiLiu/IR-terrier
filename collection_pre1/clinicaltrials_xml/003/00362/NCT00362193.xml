	<brief_title>Glycemic Relapse Prevention : Maintenance Dose Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent large randomize controlled trial proven tight glycemic control reduce microvascular macrovascular complication diabetes . Reduction complication also lead great cost saving healthcare society . However , difficult translate success large randomize control trial everyday practice . A recent cross-sectional analysis 95 clinician reveal 40.5 % type 2 diabetes patient glycated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) less 7 % . The disparity care large trial primary care office largely due difference resource available typical medical office . Practical , sustainable way maintain tight glycemic control need everyday practice . While diabetes improvement program successful acutely lower HbA1c long-term effectiveness program disappoint . Approximately 40 % return routine care complete intensive diabetes improvement program experience relapse glycemic control within one year . Some proportion relapse likely due patient 's inability maintain adherence key self-care behavior - diet , exercise , self-monitoring blood glucose medication regimen . The purpose study well understand prevention glycemic relapse . The primary aim study assess relative effectiveness three management approach , vary frequency , prevent glycemic relapse glycemic control achieve participation intensive diabetes improvement program . This study determine optimal frequency intervention need prevent glycemic relapse patient type 2 diabetes . The author hypothesize high intensity intervention lead decrease glycemic relapse dose dependent fashion .</detailed_description>
