	<brief_title>Safety Tolerability Study Levetiracetam Treat Patients With Status Epilepticus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Status epilepticus ( SE ) disorder high mortality morbidity . There strong indication ongoing seizure activity substantially reduce chance good outcome . This imply optimal treatment SE start soon possible . Unfortunately , treatment option limit often base little evidence . Besides , current treatment option hamper serious side-effects like respiratory depression impair consciousness . Therefore , advent new effective anti-epileptic drug ( AEDs ) great potential interest treatment SE . Presently , new AEDs mainly use later stage SE time disease often difficult control . The characteristic one recently introduce anticonvulsant i.e . levetiracetam seem provide number fortunate property application first-line treatment SE . The complicate side-effects “ classical ” AEDs , like decrease cardiorespiratory function level consciousness hardly present . Besides , levetiracetam may lower need benzodiazepine , reduce chance respiratory depression benzodiazepine higher dos . Due remarkable synergism first-line administered benzodiazepine , levetiracetam may therefore reduce need intubation ICU treatment . Besides , may enhance immediate cessation seizure , prolong anti-seizure activity benzodiazepine provide neuroprotective property . The sustained efficacy levetiracetam would suggest long term sequela secondary neurological damage , may also reduce . Levetiracetam IV recently show safe healthy volunteer , become available iv application clinical practice , early 2006 . To date , hardly data available applicability medical emergency like SE . We propose first step execute phase II study tolerability safety intravenous levetiracetam patient SE . Current first-line treatment SE consist standardized administration benzodiazepine . For study propose apply regimen together iv administration levetiracetam add-on therapy .</detailed_description>
