	<brief_summary>Enteroaggregative E. coli ( EAEC ) bacterium cause diarrhea . The purpose study : determine much EAEC need cause diarrhea healthy person , determine genetic factor important causing diarrhea , see body 's defense control EAEC . Participants include 25 healthy adult , age 18-40 . Volunteers assign 1 4 dose level group 5 volunteer . One volunteer group receive sodium bicarbonate placebo solution . Volunteers admit University Clinical Research Unit 8 day . Volunteers receive therapy levofloxacin treat infection either develop diarrhea Day 5 remain asymptomatic . Study procedure include saliva , blood , fecal sample collection . An optional study procedure include intestinal biopsy . Participants involve study related procedure 223 day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Enteroaggregative Escherichia coli ( EAEC ) cause diarrhea traveler industrialize nation develop country , child develop country , patient HIV . Although infection respond antibiotic therapy , increase antibiotic resistance widespread nature infection limit utility antibiotic . The development EAEC-specific vaccine would useful prevention travel-associated EAEC diarrhea decrease EAEC-associated mortality young child US develop country . The first objective study perform dose-escalation study EAEC 042 infectivity healthy adult volunteer high producer IL-8 seronegative EAEC . The study identify dose EAEC 042 need future study EAEC 042 phase I-II EAEC vaccine study . The second objective study identify humoral , secretory , cellular immune response EAEC 042 specific antigen associate EAEC infection . Study participant include 25 healthy volunteer , age 18-40 , great Houston area . Study participant assign 1 4 possible dose level group 5 volunteer . Each study group consist 4 volunteer receive EAEC 1 volunteer receive sodium bicarbonate placebo solution . Safety data result review safety monitoring committee begin next high dose group . If dose result least 3 4 infected volunteer give group , next high dose administer . Instead , concentration repeat validation dose . Healthy volunteer screen outpatient presence -251 AA SNP genotype IL-8 gene promoter . Once volunteer screen determine eligible participate study , volunteer sign consent form admit University Clinical Research Unit . The volunteer ingest determine concentration EAEC 042 placebo observe symptoms infection . All volunteer receive therapy levofloxacin eradicate infection either develop diarrhea Day 5 remain asymptomatic . Volunteers discharge hospital Day 7+/-1 . Saliva , blood , feces collect secretory , humoral , cellular immune response EAEC . An optional procedure consist obtain jejunal colonic biopsy prior challenge ( Day -13±2 ) Days 4±1 24±3 post challenge . Volunteer participation endoscopy study optional requirement rest study . The primary endpoint study include : diarrheal illness exposure EAEC , shed EAEC exposure , IgG secretory IgA ( slgA ) seroconversion EAEC dispersin . The secondary endpoint study include : increase fecal marker intestinal inflammation include cytokine lactoferrin description jejunal colonic immune response EAEC infection .</detailed_description>
