	<brief_summary>This study concern psychological physiological development infant . Specifically , researcher interested baby able group similar object , like animal vehicle , category . This study investigate whether motion aid categorization process allow early demonstration competency . Previous study demonstrate ability categorize stationary object image object , present 6 month age . This study make three experiment test : 1 . The infant 's ability categorize photographic stimulus . 2 . The infant 's ability categorize move stimulus . 3 . The infant 's ability transfer knowledge move photographic stimulus . Initially , ability 3- 6-month-old infant compare . It also possible 9-month-old infant test . Data consist look time measure ( level attention display ) heart rate . The ability infant transfer category knowledge support view motion source information object categorization .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Motion Infants ' Ability Categorize</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The major objective research well understand early development perceptual categorization . The proposed work design examine emergence infant ' ability access internal categorical representation . Representation refers simply store information influence later behavior . Categorization refers treatment discriminable object equivalent way . Even young infant appear able visually categorize diverse set discriminable pattern object . Much less know , however , infant internally represent utilize information . The present set study design probe ontogeny category representation infancy . The methodological strategy use first study consist expose infant entirely novel configuration object fix amount time later analyze infant ' examination manipulation object become familiar . Infants expose novel category object home 2-month period . Later , laboratory procedure , 5-month-old infant test familiar object similar test object . A second study utilize eye-tracking technology examine nature infant ' eye movement visually encode individual member complex category animal vehicle . Finally , third study conduct examine relation individual difference infant ' category learn subsequent variability language learning later childhood .</detailed_description>
