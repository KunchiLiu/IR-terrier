	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome consist five concurrent condition increase risk heart disease , stroke , diabetes . Persons metabolic syndrome usually high triglyceride low HDL level overweight . Low fat , high carbohydrate diet may provide cholesterol-lowering benefit obese individual non-obese individual . The purpose study compare effect low fat , high carbohydrate diet versus moderate fat , moderate carbohydrate diet heart , blood vessel , cholesterol level individual metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Metabolic Syndrome characterize elevated insulin level , excess body fat waist , elevate level glucose blood pressure , dyslipidemia . Dyslipidemia Metabolic Syndrome characterize high level triglyceride , low level HDL cholesterol , average LDL non-HDL cholesterol . Individuals elevate LDL cholesterol traditionally advise follow low fat , high carbohydrate diet . However , research show diet adequately regulate cholesterol level individual dyslipidemia . A diet consist moderate amount fat carbohydrate may beneficial individual dyslipidemia metabolic syndrome . The purpose study compare effect diet moderate fat carbohydrate versus low fat , high carbohydrate diet cholesterol level , inflammatory factor vascular response individual metabolic syndrome . During initial screening period , participant follow American Heart Association ( AHA ) Step 1 diet cholesterol level test eligibility criterion Metabolic Syndrome . Before randomized , eligible participant frequently sample intravenous glucose tolerance test ( FSIVGTT ) , abdominal CT scan measure fat content two location two brachial artery reactivity test . The FSIVGTT provide information whether participant insulin sensitive insulin resistant . The CT scan measure fat content abdomen liver . The brachial artery reactivity test measure blood flow brachial artery arm . This 7-month study consist two 1-month feeding period , rest month two feed period 4-month follow-up diet free-living setting . In Month 1 , participant randomly assign follow either moderate fat , moderate carbohydrate diet low fat , high carbohydrate diet . Participants receive prepared food study visit twice week . Weight vital sign measure study visit , blood collect baseline , Weeks 3-1/2 4 . A brachial artery reactivity test , use ultrasound measure artery size blood flow arm , perform twice Week 4 . In Month 2 rest period , participant follow AHA Step 1 diet home . In Month 3 , participant switch diet study procedure evaluation repeat Month 1 . During follow Months 4 7 , participant continue follow second assign diet , responsible prepare food . They meet dietician week 1 month learn prepare meal home . During 4-month period , blood collection , vital sign measurement , review medical history diet continue monthly visit . At end Month 7 , participant undergo two brachial artery reactivity test . As October , 2010 , 148 screen 71 eligible randomize . Seven discontinue prior completion 64 complete 7 month study . The intervention complete analyse ongoing .</detailed_description>
