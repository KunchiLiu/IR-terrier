	<criteria>1 . Has patient give informed consent accord local requirement trialrelated activity ? Trialrelated activity procedure would perform routine management patient 2 . Is patient cancer patient breakthrough pain ? 3 . Is patient age ≥18 year ? 4 . Has patient receive least past month either oral morphine , oxycodone , hydromorphone transdermal fentanyl treatment background pain ? 5 . Is current dose schedule background opioid patient equivalent 60500 mg oral morphine/day transdermal fentanyl 25200 µg/hour ? For conversion table . 6 . Is background pain generally stable average control mild level ( define ≤4 11 point NRS ) background opioid ? 7 . Is BTP ( ) general severe pain intensity patient judge he/she need additional analgesic ( apart background pain analgesic ) normally last 15 minute ? 8 . Does patient general use stable , fixedschedule , opioid regimen least three BTP episode per week four BTP episode per day ? * 9 . Has patient obtain least partial relief BTP ( ) his/her usual immediaterelease strong opioid , i.e . oral morphine , oxycodone , hydromorphone transmucosal fentanyl ? 10 . Is patient able use intranasal drug ? 11 . Does patient use adequate contraceptive precaution ( contraceptive pill , implant injection intrauterine device ) trial period ? 12 . Did patient negative pregnancy test inclusion study FT016IM FT017IM ? All exclusion criterion must answer `` '' patient participate trial . 1 . Does patient recent history substance abuse ? 2 . Is patient pregnant nursing trial period ? 3 . Has patient neurological psychiatric impairment may compromise data collection ? 4 . Has patient severe hepatic impairment ? ( Investigator 's judgement accord local practice ) 5 . Has patient recent therapy , could potentially alter pain response analgesic degree , need background opioid less 60 mg morphine morphine equivalents/day le 25 µg/hour transdermal fentanyl number BTP episodes less three per week trial period ? 6 . Has patient facial radiotherapy ? 7 . Has patient treat MAO inhibitor within last 14 day ? 8 . Does patient use Methadone Buprenorphine ? 9 . Does patient impair respiratory function extent , may severely increase risk clinically relevant respiratory depression BTP fentanyl treatment ? 10 .
