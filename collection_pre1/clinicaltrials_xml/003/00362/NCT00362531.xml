	<detailed_description>Idiopathic membranous nephropathy ( IMN ) one common form nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) adult usually treat corticosteroid combination cytotoxic drug especially cyclophosphamide cyclosporine . However , effect satisfy side-effects immunosuppressive agent often worry problem . Tacrolimus , new immunosuppressive agent , prove effective treat refractory NS especially FSGS . Whether effective IMN report . We therefore undertook multi-center , control study investigate efficacy safety profile tacrolimus compare cyclophosphamide treatment patient idiopathic membranous nephropathy nephrotic syndrome .</detailed_description>
