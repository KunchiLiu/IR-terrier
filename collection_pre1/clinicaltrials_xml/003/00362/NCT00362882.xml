	<brief_summary>This trial study two different schedule docetaxel bortezomib compare well work treat patient progressive recurrent non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving docetaxel together bortezomib may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To compare efficacy tolerability sequential v concurrent docetaxel bortezomib patient previously treat , progressive recurrent , advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECOND OBJECTIVES : I . To compare time progression patient previously treat NSCLC treat regimen . II . To compare 1-year overall survival patient treat regimen . III . To compare toxicity regimens patient . IV . To determine pharmacokinetics docetaxel context study . TERTIARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine level expression molecular marker regulate docetaxel bortezomib correlate clinical response overall survival patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) number prior chemotherapy treatment ( 1 v &gt; 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 60 minute day 1 bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive docetaxel arm I bortezomib IV 3-5 second day 2 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria : No prior malignancy except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient diseasefree 5 year . Histologically cytologically confirm nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Progressive recurrent NSCLC treatment 1 prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimen metastatic disease . Prior neoadjuvant/adjuvant chemotherapy and/or concurrent chemoradiation earlystage disease allow . At least 4 week since prior chemotherapy ( 6 week mitomycin C nitrosoureas ) recover . No prior docetaxel bortezomib Prior epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor therapy allow . Prior paclitaxel allow At least 4 week since prior major surgery recover . At least 2 week since prior concurrent enzymeinducing anticonvulsant . No concurrent hormonal therapy , biologic therapy , radiotherapy measurable lesion . Concurrent palliative radiotherapy smallfield nonindicator lesion ( e.g. , painful bony metastasis ) allow . Measurable disease* &gt; = 1 unidimensionally objectively measurable lesion , include following : Lung mass ( measurable chest xray , tomograms , CT scan ) Enlarged lymph node Liver metastasis ( measurable discrete focal lesion radionuclide CT scan , ultrasound ) Metastatic abdominal mass ( measurable CT scan &gt; = 1 perpendicular diameter ≥ distance cut ) Measurable disease must outside previous radiation field new lesion must present . Life expectancy &gt; = 12 week Progressive disease within previously radiate field allow . [ Note : *Measurable disease DOES NOT include bone metastasis nonfocal liver metastasis ] . No symptomatic untreated brain metastasis require steroid . Asymptomatic , previously treat ( surgical resection radiotherapy ) brain metastasis allow provide neurologically stable &gt; = 4 week since prior steroid .
