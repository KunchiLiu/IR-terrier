	<brief_summary>Many patient already harbor drug-resistant HIV require interruption HAART due poor compliance , poor quality life , toxicity development resistance . In patient interruption HAART negative impact patient immune status due reemergence wild-type virus general pathogenic HIV isolate contain resistance mutation . There need `` bridge '' antiretroviral regimen might prolong time conventional HAART whilst wait new regimen either fully suppressive less toxic less demanding patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Virological failure associate appearance resistant mutation still common patient receive HAART . When HAART fail patient clinician choose three different course action : 1 . Switch therapy new salvage regimen base result resistance test . Success new salvage regimen maximize new regimen include antiretroviral drug without cross-resistance previous fail drug , preferably , new class drug . In general , rescue regimen complicate patient due high pill burden ; frequent dosing sometimes need parenteral therapy ( Enfuvirtide ) . 2 . Stop therapy . This strategy feasible patient relatively preserve immune function . Time antiretroviral therapy would highly dependent previous nadir CD4 cell count ( low nadir , rapidly patient lose CD4 cell ) . In patient multidrug resistant virus strategy use goal achieve virus reversion towards wild-type form . Reversion towards wild-type virus would theoretically `` resensitize '' HIV prior fail drug . Unfortunately , number investigation suggest loss CD4 cell count occur time therapy might regain start rescue therapy . In addition , reversion towards wild type virus appear associate favourable outcome rescue therapy . 3 . Maintain failing therapy . This strategy potential advantage decrease rate CD4 cell loss . It know certain mutation HIV decrease viral fitness produce less pathogenic virus . Consequently , compare wild-type virus , CD4 destruction decrease presence resistance mutation . The important risk inherent strategy accumulation new antiretroviral mutation regimen maintain . Due cross-resistance among antiretroviral drug , accumulation new mutation decrease chance success new salvage regimen . Choosing among three different strategy depend number important factor . 1 . Availability antiretroviral drug active resistant HIV isolates . Clinicians would prone switch new salvage regimen new regimen contain new class drug and/or least three drug without cross resistance antiretroviral include fail regimen . This scenario likely first second regimen failure . However , third regimen failure possibility include least three active drug dramatically decrease . For deep salvage possibility construct viable rescue regimen often depend enrol patient clinical trial new antiretroviral ( example CCR5 inhibitor ) . Enrolment trial often imply patient wait undefined period time trial start . 2 . Willingness patient switch complicate regimen . After second regimen failure , rescue therapy involve high pill burden , frequent dosing , substantial number case , need parenteral therapy enfuvirtide . In situation possible patient prefer start new therapy due negative impact new regimen quality life . 3 . Immune status patient . In patient low CD4 cell count stop therapy put patient risk develop opportunistic disease . In general patient clinician reluctant stop therapy current CD4 cell count 200-250 cells/mL . Apart set virological failure HAART interruption might need patient well controlled viral replication ( HIV viremia persistently 50 copies/ mL ) . Possible reason HAART interruption scenario : 1 . Toxicity current regimen . 2 . Patient desire ( example travel abroad ) . 3 . Poor quality life related treatment issue . 4 . Poor adherence current HAART regimen impend risk develop resistance mutation . When patient stop HAART due reason , wild-type HIV re-emerges consequent loss CD4 cell . Depending immune status patient prior CD4 cell nadir time therapy might quite limited .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>HIV1 infection document confirmed positive HIV1 antibody test and/or positive PCR HIV1 RNA . Adult patient ( 18 year age ) . Available genotype ( current historical ) show M184V ( ≥ 2 TAMs K65R ) . CD4 cell count ≥ 350 cells/mL . Patient request HAART interruption due following : 1 . Patient receive suppressive HAART regimen problem adherence , quality life toxicity AND alternative simpler , less toxic regimen ( typically patient substantial resistance good virological control receive multiple antiretrovirals ) . 2 . Due resistance , patient receive nonsuppressive HAART regimen patient willing change new , already available , complicate optimized salvage regimen ( typically 3rd 4th line therapy ) . For woman childbearing potential , negative urine pregnancy test screen visit . Agreement take part study sign inform consent . Patients receive nonregistered antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug . Patients &lt; 50 HIVRNA copies/mL receive NNRTI . Serum HBsAg positive patient receive antiHBV active nucleoside/nucleotide . Hypersensitivity one component dosage form TDF FTC , previous history intolerance one drug . Known history drug abuse chronic alcohol consumption clinician opinion contraindicates participation study . Women pregnant breast feeding female childbearing potential use adequate method contraception accord investigator 's judgment . Current active opportunistic infection document infection within previous 4 week . Documented active malignant disease ( exclude Kaposi sarcoma limit skin ) . Renal disease creatinine clearance &lt; 50 mL/min . Concomitant use nephrotoxic immunosuppressive drug ( stop prior enrollment ) Receiving ongoing therapy systemic corticosteroid , Interleukin2 ( IL2 ) chemotherapy . Patients include study accord investigator 's criterion .</criteria>
