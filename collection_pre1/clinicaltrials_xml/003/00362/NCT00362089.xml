	<brief_summary>Pregnant lactate woman receive n-3 fatty acid start week 15 gestation 4 month post-partum ( pp ) comparison control group , get information adequately healthy nutrition pregnancy lactation . The amount fat newborn measure skinfold thickness , ultrasound , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . It hypothesise reduction arachidonic acid intake increase n-3 LC PUFAs ( long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ) via supplement contain docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) could lead less expansive fat tissue development first year life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The prevalence overweight obese child adolescent dramatically increase last two decade . In Germany every 5th school child overweight 4 - 8 % child obese . Recent study suggest fatty acid maternal nutrition may impact fat tissue development fetal period . Animal study show reduction arachidonic acid intake , high intake n-3 LC PUFAs ( i.e . DHA EPA ) result low n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio food cause less expansive fat tissue development first year life . In vitro study personal observation animal study also show n-6 fatty acid ( i.e . arachidonic acid ) stimulate differentiation preadipocytes adipocytes whereas n-3 fatty acid ( i.e . DHA EPA ) contrary effect . The impact maternal fatty acid pattern early fat tissue development clarify intervention study . Therefore plan recruit 204 pregnant woman 14th week gestation . They randomly assign intervention control group . The intervention group receive n-3 LC-PUFAs ( DHA EPA ) fish oil capsule 15th week gestation 4 month pp , control group get nutrition counsel accord recommendation German Society Nutrition time period . Blood sample pregnant lactate woman , umbilical cord blood , placental tissue blood newborn collect fatty acid analysis . Body fat mass newborn determine delivery 4 month pp via skinfold measurement , ultrasound , MRI . The hypothesis newborns group `` supplement '' mother less expansive fat tissue development child mother control group . This would innovative primary preventive approach period increase prevalence overweight obese child adolescent .</detailed_description>
