	<brief_title>Carboplatin Temozolomide ( Temodar ) Recurrent Symptomatic Residual Brain Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Surgery radiation often use treatment brain metastasis , tumor brain originate part body . It currently unknown whether patient survival time progression would experience additional benefit addition chemotherapy . Previous research appear suggest chemotherapy regimen may improve outcome patient brain metastases previously treat radiation . The current study evaluate research question provide patient recurrent symptomatic residual brain metastasis carboplatin temozolomide , two chemotherapy agent . Temozolomide demonstrate clinical antitumor efficacy malignant glioma test efficacy several type cancer . This drug appear less adverse effect compare commonly use cancer drug . Recent research indicate temozolomide also efficacy brain metastasis . In addition , previous research indicate carboplatin 's lack severe toxicity patient disease . Treatment : Study participant treat carboplatin temozolomide . Carboplatin administer intravenous infusion . Temozolomide give oral pill . Before drug administer , study participant undergo pre-treatment evaluation physical neuropsychological examination , neuro-imaging , laboratory test , quality life assessment , procedure . Carboplatin give two consecutive day . Temozolomide take study participant daily five consecutive day . Both treatment schedule repeat every 28 day . Several test exams give throughout study closely monitor patient . Study treatment discontinue due disease growth unacceptable adverse event .</detailed_description>
