	<brief_summary>After gynecologic surgery , may difficult void ( urinate ) . This problem usually short-term normal function return within day week . For reason , patient may require drainage bladder catheter immediately surgery . Currently office , use two different test see well able urinate quickly catheter remove . The purpose study see void test well gynecologic surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Two Postoperative Techniques Used Predict Voiding Efficiency After Gynecologic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative void dysfunction commonly encounter follow gynecologic surgery . This dysfunction usually short term , normal function return within day . Following uro/gynecologic surgery , patient require drainage either transurethral suprapubic catheter immediate postoperative period . Within practice , prefer drainage transurethral catheter . At point surgery , urethral catheter remove normal bladder function allow resume . At present , generally accept regimen ass void efficiency . In practice , currently employ two regimen ass void efficiency expedite catheter removal . In one technique , catheter remove patient 's bladder allow fill spontaneously . Patients ask void experience strong urge . The voided volume record post-void residual ( PVR ) measure transurethral straight catheterization . In second technique , patient 's bladder retrogradely fill 300 cc sterile fluid catheter remove . They ask void within 15 minute instillation void volume measure . The PVR obtain transurethral straight catheterization . In case , patient void &gt; 2/3 total volume ( voided volume + residual ) trial consider `` pass '' catheter remove . If patient void &lt; 2/3 total volume , trial consider `` failed '' indicative urinary retention . In case catheter replace . We aim assess ability technique accurately predict void efficiency determine one technique superior .</detailed_description>
