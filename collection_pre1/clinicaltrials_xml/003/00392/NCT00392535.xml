	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . It yet know schedule intensity-modulated radiation therapy effective treating patient prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study side effect three schedule intensity-modulated radiation therapy compare well work treat patient localized prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety efficacy conventional v hypofractionated high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy patient localized prostate cancer . - Determine side effect regimens patient . - Determine whether hypofractionated radiotherapy schedule improve therapeutic ratio either improve tumor control reduce normal tissue side effect . - Compare acute late treatment-related gastrointestinal urological toxicity patient . - Determine different prostate-specific antigen-related endpoint local failure distant metastasis . - Extend database patient treat escalated dos dose-volume histogram ( DVHs ) normal tissue risk relate common toxicity endpoint . - Develop model estimate normal tissue complication probability ( NTCP ) rectum bladder hypofractionated well conventional dose-escalated radiotherapy schedule . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize , pilot study . Patients stratify accord risk seminal vesicle involvement ( low-risk v moderate-risk high-risk ) . - Hormone therapy : Patients receive androgen-deprivation therapy comprise injection luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist monthly 3-6 month oral cyproterone acetate begin week first LHRH agonist injection continue least 2 week LHRH agonist injection . Within one week last LHRH agonist injection , patient proceed radiotherapy . - Radiotherapy : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo conventional high-dose intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) 37 fraction 7.5 week . - Arm II : Patients undergo hypofractionated high-dose IMRT 20 fraction 4 week . - Arm III : Patients undergo hypofractionated high-dose IMRT 19 fraction 3.8 week . In arm , treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess periodically study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 15 year . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,163 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
