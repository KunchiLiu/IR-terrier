	<brief_title>High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) Ablation System Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common sustain cardiac arrhythmia affect estimate 2.2 million person United States ( US ) . In addition debilitating , AF identify lead risk factor stroke . AF often associate structural heart disease , substantial number AF patient little detectable structural heart disease . A patient AF 5 time likely stroke general population . Recently , demonstrate significant portion AF patient ( 80 % - 95 % ) arrhythmia originate one four pulmonary vein ( PV 's ) . Furthermore , show isolation arrhythmia ablation , majority patient ( 50-70 % ) , eliminate markedly reduce episode AF . Currently , number modality investigate treat AF . They include radiofrequency , laser , thermal , cryo , microwave , ultrasound ablation target area atrium and/or PVs . Comparison ( ) : Clinical success High Intensity Focused Ultrasound ( HIFU ) Ablation Pulmonary Vein Isolation treatment Atrial Fibrillation , compare medical therapy anti-arrhythmic drug ( AADs ) .</detailed_description>
