	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether new investigational malaria vaccine safe , well tolerated effective experimental exposure malaria give healthy people previous exposure malaria . The vaccine consist modify form relatively common virus , adenovirus , render incapable replicate modify deliver malaria gene interest body 's cell allow cell manufacture protein encode gene present body 's immune system natural presumably effective way .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NMRC-M3V-Ad-PfCA Vaccine - Clinical Trial 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The vaccine , call NMRC-M3V-Ad-PfCA ( key : NMRC + Multi-antigen Multi-stage , Malaria Vaccine + Adenovectored + P. falciparum CSP &amp; AMA1 antigens ) , combination two recombinant adenovirus-derived construct ( adenovectors ) , one express pre-erythrocytic stage antigen circumsporozoite protein ( CSP ) express erythrocytic stage antigen Apical Membrane Antigen 1 ( AMA1 ) , 3D7 strain P. falciparum . The vector attenuate , replication-deficient adenovirus derive wildtype serotype 5 adenovirus deletion several gene . The vaccine formulate buffered saline solution ( Final Formulation Buffer = FFB ) . This Phase 1/2a , randomize , open-label , dose-escalating trial NMRC-M3V-Ad-PfCA vaccine administer intramuscularly healthy , malaria-na√Øve adult volunteer . All volunteer seronegative ( &lt; 1:500 , luciferase-based neutralizing antibody assay ; VRC , Bethesda ) adenovirus serotype 5 . In first part study ( dose-escalation phase , Part A ) , 1 x 1010 particle unit ( pu ) per construct 2 x 1010 pu total administer six volunteer single dose ass safety , 4 week later , 5 x 1010 pu per construct 1 x 1011 pu total dose ( five-fold dose escalation ) administer six additional volunteer . In second part study ( regimen-comparison phase , Part B ) , three regimen administration compare : one dose , two dos administer ten day apart , two dos administer 16 week apart . Separate group receive one dose individual component vaccine ( NMRC-MV-Ad-PfC NMRC-MV-Ad-PfA ) . Following immunization , volunteer participate regimen-comparison phase well several non-immunized control volunteer ( serve infectivity control ) challenge P. falciparum sporozoites order ass vaccine efficacy non-immunized control challenge time . The proposed design regimen-comparison phase provide information direct selection appropriate dose regimen subsequent study , also indicate whether two constituent antigen , co-formulated , act synergistically , independently , interfere induction antigen-specific immune response protective immunity .</detailed_description>
