	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine Kallmann syndrome ( KS ) idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( IHH ) affect reproductive hormone . These disorder cause defect Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone ( GnRH ) secretion . GnRH hormone release small gland brain call hypothalamus . When GnRH release , signal another gland brain , pituitary , secrete reproductive hormone influence testosterone level sperm production . This study involve detailed evaluation 8-24 hour stay hospital . In study , male age 16 old IHH detailed evaluation involves overnight study hospital . Some men ( 18 year old ) may continue receive treatment pulsatile GnRH . This treatment replace hormone absent IHH result normalize testosterone typically effective develop fertility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim study : - To identify men woman hypogonadotropic hypogonadism define spectrum abnormality GnRH secretion patient . - To study physiology control reproductive system human male female . - To determine relationship glucose metabolism testosterone level men hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . - To characterize neuroendocrine metabolic phenotype subject IHH use information make genotype-phenotype correlation . Despite variability trigger , timing , pace sexual maturity specie , specie utilize final pathway hypothalamic secretion GnRH initiate maintain reproductive axis . Thus , GnRH require reproductive competence human . The classic study Knobil colleague 1970s clearly demonstrate pulsatile release GnRH hypothalamus prerequisite physiologic gonadotrope function , continuous stimulation result paradoxical decrease gonadotrope responsiveness . Absence , decrease frequency decrease amplitude pulsatile GnRH release result clinical syndrome hypogonadotropic hypogonadism ( HH ) . Deficient GnRH secretion may occur isolation ( idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism [ IHH ] ) , association anosmia ( Kallmann syndrome [ KS ] ) result variety structural functional lesion hypothalamic-pituitary axis . The phenotypic expression GnRH deficiency human demonstrate considerable heterogeneity , suggest patient IHH KS may represent part spectrum isolate GnRH deficiency oppose represent discrete diagnostic subset . Defining physiology GnRH critical understanding clinical heterogeneity isolate GnRH deficiency . This protocol utilize disease model HH increase understand physiology GnRH secretion . Examining baseline characteristic patient isolated GnRH deficiency allow determination normal requirement endogenous GnRH secretion human . Recent study reveal association hyperinsulinemia low testosterone level men . This finding demonstrate normal physiological condition well insulin resistant state . However , causal nature directionality relationship yet understood . Specifically , low testosterone level cause insulin resistance result hyperinsulinemia vice versa . Because insulin resistance important risk factor cardiovascular disease well type 2 diabetes , important investigate relationship implication may prevention therapeutic intervention disorder .</detailed_description>
