	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn regulation reproductive hormone adult men . We would like understand role testosterone estradiol play control release LH ( lutenizing hormone ) FSH ( follicle stimulate hormone ) . Testosterone estradiol come testis , LH FSH release gland head call pituitary . Men involve study detailed evaluation involve overnight stay hospital frequent blood sampling . The men study also receive medication affect level various hormone body . This allow researcher learn various hormone influence . Men participate study receive medical evaluation monetary compensation . Information gather study help development new treatment infertility potentially new hormonal form contraception .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In United States 10-15 % couple seek evaluation infertility , male factor identify approximately 50 % case . To date , however , infertility research focus female partner majority instance etiology male infertility remain poorly understood inconsistent elevation FSH level . Given spermatogenesis highly dependent FSH secretion , project focus delineate feedback control FSH human male . Such study , although difficult perform human , critical understanding pathophysiology male infertility , also determine feasibility hormonal approach male contraception . In protocol , study normal , GnRH-deficient agonadal men employ reversible sex steroid ablation , physiologic sex steroid replacement manipulation GnRH input pituitary permit non-steroidal , sex steroid , GnRH-dependent component FSH regulation selectively elucidate .</detailed_description>
