	<brief_summary>The main purpose research study collect information learn effective erlotinib ( tarceva ) combination either bevacizumab sulindac treat patient squamous cell carcinoma head neck . Erlotinib bevacizumab target therapy drug control tumor growth target specific abnormality sometimes find cancer cell . Erlotinib target epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , bevacizumab target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . Sulindac non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) block G protein-coupled receptor laboratory evidence show associate cancer cell growth EGFR activity . The bevacizumab administer study commercially market formulation drug . Previous research head neck cancer suggest erlotinib alone anti-cancer activity . This research study design see well erlotinib work combination bevacizumab sulindac head neck cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Participants randomize either Arm A : erlotinib plus bevacizumab , Arm B : erlotinib plus sulindac . Participants equal chance place group . - Medication Arm A : erlotinib plus bevacizumab : Participants take erlotinib pill orally day . Bevacizumab give intravenously day one treatment cycle ( treatment cycle last three week ) . Urine test perform every three week test kidney function . - Medication Arm B : erlotinib plus sulindac : Participants take erlotinib pill orally day . Sulindac take orally twice day . - Physical exam perform treatment cycle include vital sign general health question . We take participant blood pressure every 2 week first 6 week . After point , take every 3 week often necessary . Blood test perform include chemistry hematology . - After every 2 cycle , repeat CT scan , MRI , and/or PET scan perform along either chest x-ray CT scan ensure tumor participant lung . We may also bone scan may tumor participant bone , abdominal CT scan may tumor liver , head CT scan MRI may tumor brain . - After final treatment participant see clinic see side effect drug within 30 day stop drug . - Participants research study long receive clinical benefit study drug , develop excessive side effect disease progression . After treatment discontinue , follow participant closely 30 day every 1-2 month .</detailed_description>
