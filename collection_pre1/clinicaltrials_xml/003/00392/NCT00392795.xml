	<brief_summary>The primary purpose proposal identify potentially modifiable risk factor long-term cognitive impairment ( i.e . development delirium exposure sedative analgesic medication ) ICU patient . The investigator quantify independent contribution risk factor incidence long-term cognitive impairment , control establish risk factor include age , pre-existing cognitive impairment , apolipoprotein E ( apoE ) genotype . Quantifying contribution modifiable risk factor pave way development preventive and/or treatment strategy reduce incidence , severity and/or duration long-term cognitive impairment improve functional recovery patient critical illness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The BRAIN Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) Study : Bringing Light Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Among Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) survivor , subsequent cognitive functional decline great threat meaningful recovery . Six small cohort indicate alarm 30 % 80 % increasingly million ICU survivor develop acquire long-term cognitive impairment ( LTCI ) functionally equivalent mild/moderate dementia may last year . Additionally , major deficit health-related quality life ( HRQL ) , functional status , `` ICU accelerate '' frailty common , especially elderly . A lead potentially modifiable risk factor devastate outcome may ICU delirium , predictor high mortality , high cost , poor cognitive function discharge . Additionally , heavy prolonged exposure potent psychoactive medication routinely administer high dos ventilate patient may last yet preventable cognitive functional effect . In proposal , Aims 1 3 determine whether delirium independent risk factor incidence , severity , and/or duration LTCI ( Aim 1 ) impair HRQL ( Aim 3 ) ICU survivor . Likewise , Aims 2 4 determine whether degree exposure sedative analgesic medication ICU patient independent risk factor incidence , severity , and/or duration LTCI ( Aim 2 ) impair HRQL ( Aim 4 ) . The study prospective cohort study enrol 800 mechanically ventilated medical surgical patient 3 diverse medical center 39 month period comprehensive follow-up test 3 12 month hospital discharge . This study quantify whether delirium sedative/analgesic exposure indeed risk factor LTCI HRQL , control covariates age , medical versus surgical ICU admission , pre-existing cognitive impairment , sepsis , apoE genotype . This pave way development preventive and/or treatment strategy reduce long-term cognitive impairment improve functional recovery old young ICU patient decades come . Major threat recovery ICU survivor acquire cognitive functional decline last year , especially old patient . To pave way future preventive interventional strategy , cohort determine degree delirium potent sedatives analgesic risk factor long-term cognitive impairment functional decline follow critical illness .</detailed_description>
