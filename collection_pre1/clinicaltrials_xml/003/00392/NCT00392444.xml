	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Advanced Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess efficacy sunitinib malate , term response rate ( complete partial ) , patient malignant pleural mesothelioma . II . Assess toxicity , safety , tolerability drug patient . III . Assess duration response stable disease , stable disease rate , progression-free survival , median overall survival rate . OUTLINE : This multicenter , nonrandomized , open-label study . Patients stratify accord prior cytotoxic chemotherapy ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
