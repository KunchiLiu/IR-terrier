	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , tegafur-uracil , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . Sometimes , surgery , tumor may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . It yet know whether chemotherapy effective observation treat colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study tegafur uracil see well work compare observation treat patient stage II colorectal cancer completely remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tegafur-Uracil Observation Treating Patients With Stage II Colorectal Cancer That Has Been Completely Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy adjuvant tegafur-uracil v observation patient curatively resect stage II colorectal cancer . Secondary - Compare relapse-free overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare occurrence adverse event patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , control study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo observation . - Arm II : Patients receive oral tegafur-uracil day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 7 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2,000 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
