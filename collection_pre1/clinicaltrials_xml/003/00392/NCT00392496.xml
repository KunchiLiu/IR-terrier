	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Mediastinal Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient relapse refractory , diffuse mediastinal , large B-cell lymphoma treat sunitinib malate . II . Determine toxicity drug patient . III . Determine effect drug peripheral blood biomarkers , circulate endothelial cell , precursor patient . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive sunitinib malate orally daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week maximum 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
