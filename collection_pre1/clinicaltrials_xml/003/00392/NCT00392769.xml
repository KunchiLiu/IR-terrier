	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn cetuximab help control disease patient recurrent endometrial cancer . Primary Objective : 1 . To determine overall disease control rate cetuximab patient progressive recurrent endometrial cancer . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine duration disease control , time disease progression , survival cohort patient . 2 . To determine nature degree toxicity cetuximab cohort patient . 3 . To correlate biologic marker response therapy tissue available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) large protein play important role tumor growth . When EGFR stimulate `` overexpressed , '' series chemical reaction happen result tumor `` tell '' grow . Researchers know EGFR overexpressed many type endometrial cancer . Cetuximab design block receptor , may help stop slow growth tumor patient whose endometrial cancer come back . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . If test do recently , may need repeat . Your complete medical history record . You physical exam , include pelvic exam measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) . Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test , test kidney liver function , pregnancy test woman able child . The pregnancy test must negative allow take part study . You chest x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan abdomen pelvis ( stomach hip area ) measure tumor . If find eligible take part study , receive cetuximab week needle vein . Each treatment cycle 4 week long . In first week first treatment cycle , receive cetuximab 120 minute ( 2 hour ) . For additional treatment , receive cetuximab 60 minute . During infusion 60 minute infusion end , closely watched sign allergic reaction . You receive diphenhydramine ( similar antihistamine ) vein , 30-60 minute receive cetuximab infusion . This order low risk side effect study drug may cause . Your doctor may decide low dose diphenhydramine later dose . Before cycle therapy 1 month treatment end , physical exam . Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . CT scan MRI repeat every 2-3 cycle end treatment . If tumor chest , chest x-ray repeat every 2-3 cycle end treatment . If partial complete response ( tumor shrink disappears completely ) disease stable ( tumor neither grown shrunk ) , CT MRI repeat 4 week later check response . You able keep receive additional treatment cycle long benefit . If disease get bad experience intolerable side effect , take study . After complete treatment study , status health disease check . Your doctor decide often check-ups occur . You may return M. D. Anderson follow-up exam , choose come clinic , contact phone see . This investigational study . Cetuximab commercially available FDA approve treatment colorectal cancer . Its use treatment endometrial cancer study experimental . Up 40 patient take part study . Up 30 patient enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must sign approve informed consent . 2 . Histologically confirm progressive recurrent endometrial cancer ( endometrioid , serous , clear cell , mixed malignant Mullerian tumor , mixed histology ; grade ) . 3 . Patients must fail least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen recurrent disease ( include chemosensitizing radiation ) . 4 . All patient must measurable disease . Measurable disease define lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long dimension record ) . Each lesion must &gt; 20 mm measure conventional technique , include palpation , plain xray , CT , MRI , &gt; 10 mm measure spiral CT. Ascites pleural effusion consider measurable disease . If measurable disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature confirm cytology/histology . 5 . Patients must Zubrod performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . 6 . Patients must either child bear potential negative pregnancy test within 7 day treatment . Patients consider child bear potential surgically sterile ( undergone hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal great 12 month . 7 . Patients must pretreatment granulocyte count ( i.e. , segment neutrophils + band ) &gt; 1,000/Fl , hemoglobin level &gt; /= 9.0 gm/dL platelet count &gt; 75,000/Fl . 8 . Patients must adequate renal function document serum creatinine &lt; /= 2.0 mg/dL . 9 . Patients must adequate hepatic function document serum bilirubin &lt; /= 2.5 mg/dL , regardless whether patient liver involvement secondary tumor . 10 . Aspartate transaminase ( SGOT ) must &lt; /= 3x institutional upper limit normal unless liver involved tumor , case , aspartate transaminase must &lt; /=5 x institutional upper limit normal . 11 . Prior begin therapy , least 4 week must elapse since prior chemotherapy , surgery , radiation therapy investigational therapy . Patients receive palliative radiation therapy exempt 4 week wait period . 1 . Patients uterine sarcoma . 2 . Patients isolated recurrence ( vaginal , pelvic , paraaortic ) amenable potentially curative treatment radiation therapy surgery . 3 . Patients severe concurrent disease , would make patient inappropriate entry study , include significant hepatic , renal , gastrointestinal disease . 4 . Patients history prior malignancy except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , cancer patient diseasefree least five year . 5 . Patients active uncontrolled systemic infection . 6 . Patients history uncontrolled cardiac disease ; i.e. , uncontrolled hypertension , unstable angina , recent myocardial infarction ( within prior 6 month ) , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , cardiomyopathy ejection fraction 40 % . 7 . Patients receive prior therapy specifically directly target EGFR pathway . 8 . Patients experience prior severe infusion reaction monoclonal antibody . 9 . Patients pregnant breast feed . 10 . Presence clinically apparent untreated central nervous system metastasis . 11 . Patients carcinomatous meningitis . 12 . Patients deep venous arterial thrombosis ( include pulmonary embolism ) within 6 week study entry . Patients may maintenance anticoagulation therapy . 13 . Patients previously document human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . 14 . Patients currently receive chemotherapy radiation therapy .</criteria>
