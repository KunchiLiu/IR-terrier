	<brief_summary>Manganese ( Mn ) essential metal require normal growth development . However , exposure high Mn level toxic brain . The objective project identify neonatal young pediatric population increase risk excessive brain Mn deposition alter cognitive motor development base dietary parenteral Mn exposure , make sound evidence-based recommendation appropriate Mn supplementation monitoring infant young child receive parenteral nutrition ( PN ) . Our study design test hypothesis , compare unexposed age-matched control , infant young child receive prolonged Mn-supplemented PN increase deposition Mn brain low score neurodevelopmental , cognitive psychophysiological assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims design test hypothesis three developmentally distinct population : 1. preterm infant 2. full term infant Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) require prolong PN 3. old infant young child home PN . Mn neurotoxicity investigate longitudinal assessment cognitive ( executive functioning battery ) , neurodevelopmental ( Bayley III Scales Infant Development ) , psychophysiological ( event-related potential ) measure correlate brain deposition Mn use technique magnetic resonance ( MR ) relaxometry vulnerable population infant receive Mn-supplemented PN age-matched control . This proposal address clinically relevant unexplored link nutritional practice , brain Mn deposition neurodevelopmental sequelae at-risk population infant young child utilize state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technology neurodevelopmental assessment technique . The potential increase brain Mn accumulation infant , inference , potential health risk associate elevate brain Mn burden , represent crucial , unexplored issue exposure susceptibility . The potential contribution Mn toxicity poor outcome infant dependent extend time PN fully acknowledge study . Improved understanding relationship Mn exposure developmental outcome undoubtedly lead altered clinical practice careful monitor Mn intake blood and/or brain Mn level high risk infant . Our study also contribute improve understanding value non-invasive MR image monitor pediatric patient PN .</detailed_description>
