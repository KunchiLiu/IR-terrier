	<brief_summary>Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ALI/ARDS ) severe lung condition cause respiratory failure . Individuals ALI/ARDS often require use respirator artificial breathing machine , know mechanical ventilator , intensive care unit ( ICU ) . Past research show improved short-term clinical outcome result use protective mechanical ventilation technique lung . This study evaluate effect low tidal volume ventilation , aspects critical illness ICU care , long-term clinical outcome individual ALI/ARDS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-Term Results Mechanically Ventilated Individuals With Acute Lung Injury/Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALI/ARDS life-threatening condition involve inflammation lung fluid accumulation air sac , lead low blood oxygen level respiratory failure . Common cause include pneumonia , septic shock , lung trauma . Symptoms usually develop within 24 48 hour original injury illness , patient require immediate care intensive care unit ( ICU ) . The main form treatment ALI/ARDS delivery oxygen continuous level pressure damage lung mechanical ventilation . Past research show low tidal volume ventilation ( LTVV ) , protective ventilator management technique lower volume oxygen administer , improve short-term clinical outcome individual ALI/ARDS . However , long-term impact LTVV remain unknown . The purpose study evaluate effect LTVV long-term outcome individual ALI/ARDS . This study enroll individual admit ICU recently diagnose ALI/ARDS . Once enrol , participant ' medical record review demographic medical information . Participants examine determine level cognition delirium . Questionnaires use assess participant 's status prior ICU admittance , include level hearing , physical functioning , quality life , employment , live status . Questionnaires give participant well close contact increase reliability feedback . While ICU , participant receive normal clinical care . Data laboratory test , mechanical ventilator setting , arterial blood gas value , medical status collect throughout ICU stay . Information regard medical staff-to-patient ratio use different medical treatment therapy also collect review medical record interview nurse . Follow-up evaluation , last approximately four hour , occur 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 month follow ALI/ARDS diagnosis . At follow-up visit , participant undergo physical examination , standardized survey test use assess medical outcome , organ impairment , pulmonary function , mental function , quality life . If participant unable return research clinic follow-up evaluation , visit may occur home phone . The original 2-year follow-up duration , participant consent , subsequently extend allow 5-year follow-up . In recruit previously consent participant 5-year follow-up extension , randomize select recruitment strategy ( e.g. , different mail telephone strategy ) order gain insight regard effective method recruit participant .</detailed_description>
