	<brief_summary>As preeclampsia disease specially affect young primiparous woman , due fact find previously several study prevalence 12 % , ensure confidence 95 % power 80 % , necessary include total 190 woman ( 95 arm ) , therefore plan recluse total 200 pregnant woman currently attend outpatient clinic HGOIA pregnancy control week 20 gestation . From one woman clinical research team obtain obstetric , anthropometric clinical record follow current regulation Ecuadorian Public Health Ministry . All woman include detailed prenatal control every 4 week week 20 pregnancy , include gestational age , weight , umbilical perimeter , uterine altitude , fetal cardiac frequency maternal blood pressure . In addition , schedule visit urine test do ( discard proteinuria ) , also venous blood sample ( 10 ml ) heparinized tube take immediately transported Biomedical Center centrifugation plasma isolation . During week 20 , woman assign ( use randomize number table ) one follow group : ) intervention group , receive two capsule 100 mg coenzyme Q10 twice daily delivery ; b ) control group , receive two capsule correspondent placebo twice daily delivery . Both , active placebo capsule manufacture provider ( Jarrow Formulas , Los Angeles , CA , USA ) guarantee weight , size , odor color similar . Absolutely woman participate study know contact information clinical team allow request medical care frequent need , independently establish obstetrical control . Preeclampsia diagnosis perform clinical researcher base persistent high blood pressure high 140/90 mmHg proteinuria high 300 mg/24 hour . Coenzyme Q10 measure use high performance liquid chromatography equipment ( HPLC ) method previously describe validate group . The hypothesis group receive CoQ10 supplementation less case preeclampsia compare placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research conduct collaboration Experimental Pharmacology Cellular Metabolism Biomedical Center Central University Ecuador Department Obstetric Pathology Gynecology Obstetrics Hospital `` Isidro Ayora '' ( HGOIA ) Quito , Ecuador . It propose descriptive , prospective , double blind , randomize placebo control experimental study identify cause-effect rather effectiveness treatment , approval Bioethics Committee ( COBI ) Biomedical Center well Bioethics Committee HGOIA , one possible woman include study , careful detailed lecture explanation objectives procedures one researcher invite take part ask sing respective inform consent . As preeclampsia disease specially affect young primiparous woman , due fact find previously several study prevalence 12 % , ensure confidence 95 % power 80 % , necessary include total 190 woman ( 95 arm ) , therefore plan recluse total 200 pregnant woman , primigravida , young 25 year old history disease related cardiovascular , endocrine , metabolic reproductive system , currently attend outpatient clinic HGOIA pregnancy control week 20 gestation . Those woman positive inclusion criterion accept participate study randomize one treatment group . From one woman clinical research team obtain obstetric , anthropometric clinical record follow current regulation Ecuadorian Public Health Ministry . Women history hypertension , currently take kind medication , want participate study exclude . All woman include detailed prenatal control every 4 week week 20 pregnancy , include gestational age , weight , umbilical perimeter , uterine altitude , fetal cardiac frequency maternal blood pressure . These information collect clinical record HGOIA special designate form useful later data entry electronic database ( Epi Info V6.04 ) . In addition , schedule visit urine test do ( discard proteinuria ) , also venous blood sample ( 10 ml ) heparinized tube take immediately transported Biomedical Center centrifugation plasma isolation . Plasma aliquots 500 ul frozen -80Â°C analysis . During process sample protect direct light aluminum foil extreme temperature refrigerate flask . Samples receive Biomedical Center identify code ; therefore biochemical analysis also perform blind fashion . During week 20 , woman assign ( use randomize number table ) one follow group : ) intervention group , receive two capsule 100 mg coenzyme Q10 twice daily delivery ; b ) control group , receive two capsule correspondent placebo twice daily delivery . Both , active placebo capsule manufacture provider ( Jarrow Formulas , Los Angeles , CA , USA ) guarantee weight , size , odor color similar . The different bottle woman prepare member team relate clinical control woman , careful control number tablet bottle take later analyze accomplishment treatment . The blind code obtain intervention start responsibility principal investigator end study . Absolutely woman participate study know contact information clinical team allow request medical care frequent need , independently establish obstetrical control . In addition , part study attention HGOIA mandatory . Preeclampsia diagnosis perform clinical researcher base persistent high blood pressure high 140/90 mmHg measure two time patient rest least 10 minute mercury sphygmomanometer two time ( Riester , Germany ) proteinuria high 300 mg/24 hour two cross diskstip 3-24 hour apart . Coenzyme Q10 alpha tocopherol measure use high performance liquid chromatography equipment ( HPLC ) method previously describe validate group . In brief , plasma sample process HPLC equip reverse phase ODS-C18 column ( 5 um , 150x4.6 mm ) respective guard column ( 5 um , 10x4.6 mm ) . Mobile phase methanol/ethanol ( 40:60 v/v ) previously filter continuous flow 1ml/min . The UV detector set wavelength 275 nm . Samples ( 0.5 ml ) mix 0.5 ml sodium dodecyl sulphate ( SDS ) 20 % 50 ul CoQ9 solution ethanol internal standard . Later add 2 ml methanol/propanol solution ( 95:5 v/v ) vorterex vigorously 30 second , , 5 ml hexane add vorterex 60 second . Organic aqueous solvent separate centrifugation low speed ( 1000 g 5 min ) . Four half ml organic phase transfer another vial dissecatted continuous nitrogen flow reconstitute ethanol . Prepared sample immediately analyze kept time ice protect form light . Measurements perform duplicate average value use statistical analysis . Intra inter assay variation coefficient , well recover percentage calculate ensure uniformity assay . Also , total cholesterol , well , low high cholesterol lipoprotein measure use spectrophotometer . Primary endpoint number preeclampsia case group , severity disease quality newborn ( weight , height , cephalic perimeter gestational age bear ) .</detailed_description>
