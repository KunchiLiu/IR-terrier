	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation common complication pulmonary resection . Patients develop atrial fibrillation require additional treatment likely stay hospital longer period time increase cost associated operation . We propose randomize controlled trial see oral amiodarone give one week surgery prevent atrial fibrillation pulmonary resection . We plan evaluate incidence atrial fibrillation patient receive preoperative amiodarone compare incidence atrial fibrillation patient receive preoperative amiodarone .</brief_summary>
