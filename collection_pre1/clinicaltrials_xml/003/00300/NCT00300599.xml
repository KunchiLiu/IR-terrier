	<brief_summary>Sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) briefly mean cessation breathe sleep least 5 time per hour . Sleep-disordered breathing affect 9 24 % middle-aged overall 4 % middle-aged male suffers Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSAS ) i.e . SDB associate daytime sleepiness . Several major epidemiological study show SDB independent risk factor systemic hypertension also associate cardiovascular complication heart failure , stroke , sudden death . The mechanisms linkage Sleep-disordered breathing cardiovascular disease fully determine surge sympathetic nerve activity see end apneic episode accompany large rise systemic arterial blood pressure ( BP ) . The increased level muscle sympathetic nerve activity diminish nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy . Numerous study find hypercoagulable state term increase clot factor platelet activity , impaired fibrinolysis coronary artery disease , ischaemic stroke , sleep-disordered breathing . Common carotid artery intima-media thickness ( IMT ) show correlate traditional vascular risk factor may predict likelihood acute coronary event stroke . Recently , carotid artery intima-media thickness show positive correlation severity sleep disorder breathing . Despite robust evidence show improvement symptom , cognitive function quality life patient obstructive sleep apnea treat nasal continuous positive airway pressure , conflict short-term data whether continuous positive airway pressure reduce blood pressure patient obstructive sleep apnea . This randomize control study aim assess long-term effect nasal continuous positive airway pressure 1 ) 24 hr systemic blood pressure ; 2 ) Coagulation state ; 3 ) Carotid artery intimal medium thickness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects Methods : We propose carry prospective , randomize control study 100 consecutive patient newly diagnose obstructive sleep apnea syndrome , define overnight sleep study show Apnea- hypopnoea index ( AHI ) &gt; or=5 per hour sleep plus Epworth sleepiness scale ( ESS ) ≥10.1 The patient recruit Respiratory Clinic , Prince Wales Hospital ( PWH ) , Shatin . Sleep assessment : Overnight diagnostic polysomnography ( PSG ) [ Healthdyne Alice 4 , USA ] perform Prince Wales Hospital , Hong Kong every subject first night record electroencephalogram , electro-oculogram , submental electromyogram , bilateral anterior tibial electromyogram , electrocardiogram , chest abdominal wall movement inductance plethysmography , airflow measure nasal pressure transducer [ PTAF2 , Pro-Tech , Woodinville , WA , USA ] supplement oronasal airflow thermister , finger pulse oximetry previous studies.2,3 Sleep stage score accord standard criterion Rechtshaffen Kales.4 Apnoea define cessation airflow &gt; 10 second hypopnea reduction airflow &gt; 50 % &gt; 10 second plus oxygen desaturation &gt; 3 % arousal . Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ( ABPM ) : All patient obstructive sleep apnea syndrome fit Ultralite Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ( Spacelabs Medical , Redmond , WA ) via arm cuff out-patients normal activity monitor 48 hr prior commencement continuous positive airway pressure conservative treatment . The patient ' arm circumference measure biceps level appropriate size arm cuff apply . The machine program cuff inflation measurement every 30 minute 48 hr remove bathing . Patients ask abstain caffeine-containing product time continue normal daily activity . Patients record time retire bed subsequent time wake order identify sleep period . Data gather 6pm second evening discard allow acclimatization analysis perform second 24 hr data ( 6pm 6am ) .5 Data manually check artifact respiratory fellow , blind treatment status patient . Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring repeat patient significant OSAS 3 , 6 , 12 month study . Conservative treatment 6 month follow continuous positive airway pressure 6 month vs Concurrent continuous positive airway pressure+ Conservative treatment 12 month : Following confirmation significant obstructive sleep apnea syndrome overnight sleep study Apnoea hyponea index ≥ 5/hr Epworth Sleepiness Scale ≥10 completion baseline Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring , patient interview physician duty randomize computer either Group 1 ) Conservative treatment first 6 month follow therapeutic Continuous positive airway pressure next 6 month Group 2 ) Conservative treatment plus therapeutic Continuous positive airway pressure 12 month . As sleepiness main indication Continuous positive airway pressure treatment , decide randomize placebo control design feasible long-term study . The research nurse responsible randomization patient different treatment arm participate outcome assessment , conduct different team nurse aware randomization status patients.6,7 Group 1 : After confirmation significant obstructive sleep apnea syndrome , patient informed nature disease need start treatment . They encourage ) avoid sleep deprivation sufficient hour sleep every night ; b ) sleep lateral position ; c ) avoid sedative alcohol consumption ; ) lose weight follow home diet prescribed dietitian.8 The patient review respiratory clinic 1 , 3 6 month re-assess sleepiness &amp; body mass index . Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring repeat 3 , 6 , 12 month . On completion conservative treatment evaluation include ambulatory blood pressure monitor 6 month , patient group 1 start therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure treatment , outline group 2 , overnight continuous positive airway pressure titration study . Group 2 : Patients therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure arm give short trial continuous positive airway pressure therapy Autoset ( Resmed , Sydney , Australia ) device approximately 30 minute acclimatization afternoon . Each patient give basic CPAP education programme respiratory nurse supplement education brochure.2 Attended continuous positive airway pressure titration perform Autoset auto-titrating device second night polysomonograph study . All patient prescribe Horizon LT 8001 continuous positive airway pressure device ( De Vilbiss , Somerset , PA , USA ) time counter record machine run time . The continuous positive airway pressure pressure patient set minimum pressure need abolish snoring , obstructive respiratory event airflow limitation 95 % night determine overnight Autoset continuous positive airway pressure titration study . 2,3 The patient follow Respiratory clinic 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month objective continuous positive airway pressure compliance measure time counter . All patient arm follow Respiratory clinic regularly objective continuous positive airway pressure usage measure time counter . Other outcome assessment : Prior commencement conservative treatment nasal continuous positive airway pressure , patient go several measurement . These include assessment subjective sleepiness Epworth sleepiness scale ( ESS ) ,9 quality life Calgary Sleep Apnoea Quality Life Index ( SAQLI ) , 10 hemostatic assay ( DD , TAT , fibrinogen , vWF : ag ) ,11 evaluation carotid artery initimal medium thickness.12-14 The ESS questionnaire specific symptom daytime sleepiness patient ask score likelihood fall asleep eight different situation different level stimulation , add total score 0 24.9 The Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index ( SAQLI ) 35 question organize four domain : daily function , social interaction , emotional functioning symptom fifth domain , treatment-related symptom , record possible negative impact treatment . It contain item show important patient sleep apnea design measure outcome clinical trial sleep apnea.10 The early version Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index ( SAQLI ) apply previously study Chinese obstructive sleep aonoea patient continuous positive airway pressure 2 updated version apply study.15 Carotid artery intimal medium thickness assess B-mode Doppler accord standardized scanning protocol right leave carotid artery use image far wall distal 10 mm common carotid artery describe Woo et al previously.12-14 Carotid scan analyzed computerize edge-detection system previously describe validated.12,16 Two end-diastolic frame select , digitize , analyzed mean intimal medium thickness , average read 2 frame calculate right left carotid artery .
