	<brief_summary>This 2-phase study determine safety treat patient malignant melanoma genetically engineer HyperAcute-Melanoma vaccine . It establish proper vaccine dose examine side effect potential benefit treatment . The vaccine contain kill melanoma cell contain mouse gene cause production foreign pattern protein-sugars cell surface . It hop immune response foreign substance stimulate immune system attack patient 's cancer cell similar protein without sugar pattern , cause tumor remain stable shrink . Patients 18 year age old malignant melanoma may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , urinalysis , chest x-rays CT scan . MRI , PET , ultrasound scan may obtain need . Participants receive twelve vaccination two week apart . The vaccine inject skin , similar way tuberculosis skin test give . Phase I study treat successive group patient increase number vaccine cell evaluate side effect treatment determine optimum dose . Phase II look beneficial effect vaccine give high dose find safe Phase I . Monthly blood sample draw 6 month vaccine treatment . In addition , patient follow-up visit schedule every 3 month remain first year ( 6 month ) vaccination every 6 month next 2 year follow test procedure evaluate treatment response side effect : Medical history physical examination Blood test X-rays various scan ( nuclear medicine/CT/MRI ) FACT-G Assessment questionnaire measure impact treatment patient 's general well-being . The questionnaire administer begin treatment , monthly treatment , follow-up visit complete treatment . It include question severity cancer symptom ability perform normal activity daily life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According statistic American Cancer Society , estimate 55,000 individual diagnose malignant melanoma 8,000 die disease year Unites States despite current therapy . This protocol attempt exploit approach melanoma vaccine therapy use naturally occur barrier xenotransplantation human attempt vaccinate patient melanoma The expression murine alpha ( 1,3 ) galactosyltransferase [ alpha ( 1,3 ) GT ] gene result cell surface expression alpha ( 1,3 ) galactosyl-epitopes ( alpha-gal ) membrane glycoprotein glycolipids . These epitope major target hyperacute rejection response occur organ transplant non-primate donor specie man . Human host often pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibody bind alpha-gal epitope lead rapid activation complement cell lysis . The pre-existing anti-alpha-gal antibody find individual think due exposure alpha-gal epitope naturally express normal gut flora lead chronic immunological stimulation . These antibody may comprise 1 % serum IgG . In Phase I/II trial , patient advance stage melanoma undergo series twelve intradermal injection trivalent vaccine compose irradiated allogeneic melanoma cell line ( HAM-1 , HAM-2 HAM-3 ) . These cell line transduce recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus ( MoMLV ) -based retroviral vector express murine alpha ( 1,3 ) GT gene . Endpoints study include determination dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , tumor immunological response .</detailed_description>
