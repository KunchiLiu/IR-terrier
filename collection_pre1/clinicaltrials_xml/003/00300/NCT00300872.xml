	<brief_summary>Sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) briefly mean cessation breathe sleep least 5 time per hour . SDB common disorder affect 9 24 % middle-aged overall 4 % middle-aged male population suffers Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSA ) i.e . Sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) associate daytime sleepiness . Several major epidemiological study show SDB independent risk factor hypertension also strongly associate heart failure stroke . The mechanism linkage SDB cardiovascular consequence fully determine . Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) soluble 34-46 kD angiogenic heparin-binding glycoprotein . This cytokine regulate multiple endothelial cell function include vascular permeability vascular tone data suggest may contribute atherosclerotic process . Recent study show increased plasma serum concentration Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) patient OSA correlation VEGF concentration severity OSA , indexed minimum oxygen saturation level frequency upper airway obstruction per hour sleep . A recent non-randomized study small sample size show significant decrease Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) concentration patient nocturnal hypoxia improve 1 year nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy . Despite robust evidence show improvement symptom , cognitive function quality life obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) patient treat nasal CPAP , nevertheless conflict data whether Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) reduce daytime blood pressure ( BP ) patient OSA . Two randomize placebo control study show reduction 24-hr systolic diastolic blood pressure ( BP ) obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) patient 1 month nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy investigator show benefit . This randomized , sham-placebo control study aim assess 1 ) effect nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) period 3 month 24 hr blood pressure ( BP ) ; 2 ) whether change BP plasma Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) relate baseline severity obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) compliance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects Methods : We propose carry prospective , randomized sham placebo-controlled parallel study 140 consecutive patient newly diagnose OSA , define overnight sleep study show apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; 10 per hour sleep plus excessive daytime sleepiness two follow symptom : choke gasp sleep , recurrent awakening sleep , unrefreshed sleep , daytime fatigue impair concentration.1 The patient recruit Respiratory Clinic , Prince Wales Hospital , Shatin , HK . Sleep assessment : Overnight diagnostic polysomnography ( PSG ) [ Healthdyne Alice 4 , USA ] perform every subject first night record electroencephalogram , electro-oculogram , submental electromyogram , bilateral anterior tibial electromyogram , electrocardiogram , chest abdominal wall movement inductance plethysmography , airflow measure nasal pressure transducer [ PTAF2 , Pro-Tech , Woodinville , WA , USA ] supplement oral thermister , finger pulse oximetry previous studies.2-4 Sleep stage score accord standard criterion Rechtshaffen Kales . 5 Apnoea define cessation airflow &gt; 10 second hypopnea reduction airflow &gt; 50 % &gt; 10 second plus oxygen desaturation &gt; 3 % arousal . Following confirmation significant obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSA ) overnight sleep study apnea hypopnea index ( AHI ) &gt; 10/hr , patient interview physician duty randomize 2 group receive either nasal therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment sham continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , via balanced block design , completion record 24 hr ambulatory blood pressure ( BP ) . Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ( ABPM ) : All patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) fit Ultralite Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ( ABPM ) ( Spacelabs Medical , Redmond , WA ) via arm cuff out-patients normal activity monitor 48 hr prior commencement therapeutic sham continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment . The patient ' arm circumference measure biceps level appropriate size arm cuff apply . The machine program cuff inflation measurement every 30 minute 48 hr remove bathing . Patients ask abstain caffeine-containing product time continue normal daily activity . Patients record time retire bed subsequent time wake order identify sleep period . Data gather 6pm second evening discard allow acclimatization analysis perform second 24 hr data ( 6pm 6am ) .6 Data manually check artifact respiratory fellow , blind treatment status patient . Forty-eight hrs end therapeutic sham continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) 3 month , patient fit Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring ( ABPM ) machine procedure repeat . Measurement blood sample : Fifteen ml fast venous blood take patient overnight PSG . Plasma separate within 2 hour refrigerate centrifuge , aliquoted store -70C assayed . Plasma VEGF measure quantitative enzyme-linked immunoassay technique use commercially available kit ( R &amp; D Systems , Abingdon , UK ) . Serum lipids check report Vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) also increase patient hyperlipidemia , without atherosclerosis.7 Therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) v Sham placebo : Patients therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) sham continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment arm offer 30-minute daytime trial nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment . Each patient give basic continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) education program respiratory nurse supplement education brochure.4 The nurse fit comfortable continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) mask wide range selection patient , give short trial continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy Autoset ( Resmed , Sydney , Australia ) continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) arm approximately 30 minute acclimatization afternoon . Attended continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) titration perform Autoset auto-titrating device second night PSG study group randomize therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) arm.2-4 All patient therapeutic continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) arm prescribe Horizon LT 8001 continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) device ( De Vilbiss , Somerset , PA , USA ) time counter record machine run time . The continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) pressure patient set minimum pressure need abolish snoring , obstructive respiratory event airflow limitation 95 % night determine overnight Autoset continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) titration study . The patient randomize subtherapeutic continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) arm CPAP unit set low pressure ( 4 cm water pressure ) 6 extra 4mm hole insert collar main tube end mask allow air escape prevent carbon dioxide rebreathing.8,9 They give trial 30 minute acclimatization start continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) home . All patient arm follow Respiratory clinic separately 1 month 3 month objective continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) compliance measure time counter . Although 2 different treatment arm explain patient information , patient aware whether receive therapeutic sham continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . The research nurse responsible randomization patient different treatment arm participate outcome assessment , conduct different team nurse aware randomization status patients.9 At end study ( ie 3 month ) , patient subtherapeutic continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) arm readmitted AutoSet continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) titration establish long-term therapeutic pressure . Other outcome assessment : Prior commencement nasal therapeutic sham continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , patient go several measurement . These include assessment subjective sleepiness Epworth sleepiness scale ( ESS ) 10 , quality life Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index ( SAQLI ) .11 The ESS questionnaire specific symptom daytime sleepiness patient ask score likelihood fall asleep eight different situation different level stimulation , add total score 0 24.10 The Calgary Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index ( SAQLI ) 35 question organize four domain : daily function , social interaction , emotional functioning symptom fifth domain , treatment-related symptom , record possible negative impact treatment . The Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index ( SAQLI ) high degree internal consistency , face validity judge content expert patient construct validity show positive correlation Short Form-36 Health Survey questionnaire ( SF-36 ) improvement score patient successfully complete 4 week ' trial continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) .11 It contain item show important patient sleep apnea design measure outcome clinical trial sleep apnea , apply previously Chinese obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) patient continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . 4 All patient complete Epworth Sleepiness Score ( ESS ) Sleep Apnea Quality Life Index ( SAQLI ) baseline , 1 month 3 month treatment .</detailed_description>
