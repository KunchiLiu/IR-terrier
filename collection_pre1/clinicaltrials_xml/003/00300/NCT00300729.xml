	<brief_title>Effect Celecoxib Survival Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study ( CYCLUS trial , CY-cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor , Chemotherapy , LUng cancer , Survival ) prospective randomize double-blind multicenter trial . Patients randomize receive celecoxib dose 400 mg b.i.d . placebo . Primary endpoint trial survival . Secondary endpoint : quality life , progression-free survival , toxicity , cardiovascular event , biological parameter ( plasma VEGF proteomics ) . The rationale behind study consist preclinical observation antitumor effect celecoxib NSCLC . Inhibition angiogenesis proliferation well increase apoptosis demonstrate . In addition , pilot study show combination chemotherapy celecoxib feasible . No unexpected toxicity record trial . Furthermore , randomize study indomethacin , prednisolone placebo type advance cancer , mainly gastrointestinal , show survival advantage patient receive antiinflammatory treatment . Chemotherapy give accord current standard participate institution . In practice , patient usually receive either carboplatin + gemcitabine carboplatin + vinorelbine . Treatment duration chemotherapy 4 cycle ( cycle length 3 week ) absence tumour progression prohibitive toxicity . Treatment study drug start first day cancer chemotherapy . Maximum treatment duration one year . Treatment stop early case objective tumor progression , serious toxicity consider related study drug patient want stop treatment . The size study base hypothesis celecoxib could prolong median survival 8 week compare 7.5 month placebo group . With standard statistical requirement ( type I error 5 % , type II error 20 % ) , calculate number patient 760 . The study support Swedish Lung Cancer Study Group organize multicenter trial , participation seven university hospital six small hospital . The number new case NSCLC stage IIIB-IV performance status 0-2 Sweden around 1200/year . It expect 20 % patient could include study , would make completion possible three year . The study open randomization May 31 , 2006 . Recruitment patient lower expect . The study close randomization May 31 , 2009 , originally plan . 319 patient include . Since maximum duration treatment study drug one year , code break May 31 , 2010 . Data analysis plan take place summer autumn , 2010 .</detailed_description>
