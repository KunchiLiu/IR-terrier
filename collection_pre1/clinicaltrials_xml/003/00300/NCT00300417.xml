	<brief_summary>This study test safety experimental vaccine prevent West Nile virus infection . The virus spread mainly mosquito bite . Symptoms include high fever , headache , neck stiffness , stupor , muscle weakness , vision loss , numbness paralysis . Rarely , infection lead permanent nerve damage possibly death . The vaccine use study make DNA code West Nile virus protein . Injected muscle , DNA instruct body make small amount West Nile virus protein . This study see body create resistance immunity protein . Participants get West Nile virus vaccine . Healthy normal volunteer 18 65 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test various infection medical problem . Women able become pregnant give pregnancy test . Women pregnant breastfeeding may participate . Anyone receive vaccination Yellow Fever Japanese Encephalitis virus past may participate research study . Participants receive three injection experimental vaccine , first first study day ( Day 0 ) , second Day 28 , third Day 56 . The injection give device call BiojectorÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) 2000 delivers vaccine skin muscle without use needle . On day injection , subject give diary card take home recording temperature symptom side effect 5 day . They return clinic 2 week injection , bring complete card time . In addition injection , subject follow test procedure clinic visit : - Medical history , need , physical examination : Day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 32 - Vital sign weight : Day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 32 - Lymph node exam : Day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 - Blood sample : Day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 24 32 - Pregnancy test ( woman ) : Day 0 week 4 , 8 32 - Urine sample : Day 0 week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 The blood urine test health check . Some blood sample also use study immune response vaccine gene test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study West Nile Virus Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I open-label study evaluate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity recombinant DNA vaccine , VRC-WNVDNA020-00-VP . The hypothesis regimen safe human administration elicit high titer neutralize antibody response prior WNV DNA vaccine . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability humans investigational vaccine healthy young adult healthy old adult . Secondary exploratory objective relate immunogenicity study vaccine . Product Description : VRC-WNVDNA020-00-VP composed single closed-circular DNA plasmid encodes WNV viral protein precursor transmembrane ( prM ) envelope ( E ) CMV/R promoter . Vaccine vial supply 4 mg/mL . Each DNA vaccination 1 mL vaccine administer intramuscularly ( IM ) deltoid muscle use Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System ( Biojector ) . Subjects : A total 30 healthy adult enrol two group : Group 1 comprise 15 healthy adult 18 50 year old Group 2 comprise 15 healthy adult 51 65 year old . Study Plan : All subject receive 3 injection schedule show schema . The protocol require nine clinic visit three telephone follow-up contact . Study Duration : 32 week clinical follow participant . A long-term follow-up contact Week 52 may include interim medical history research blood draw ; subject may opt long-term contact occur telephone , e-mail mail interim medical history . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint safety tolerability regimen . The secondary immunogenicity endpoint WNV neutralize antibody , WNV specific antibody measure ELISA , WNV-specific T cell response measure intracellular cytokine staining ( ICS ) assay ELISPOT . Other immunogenicity assay Week 32 may also complete exploratory evaluation , well Week 52 blood sample collect .</detailed_description>
