	<brief_title>Computer-assisted Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) With Zimmer LPS Flex Knee System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study determine clinical outcome biomechanical gait performance patient receive Zimmer Legacy® LPS Flex Knee system use computer-assisted surgical technique . Pre post-operative clinical gait variable compare within computer-assisted group . These comparison also make computer-assisted surgical group conventional surgical group receive knee implant . This study provide evidence whether difference two surgical procedure respect complication infection dislocation , rate level functional recovery , blood loss , operate time , degree radiographic correction quality duration post-operative pain stiffness .</detailed_description>
