	<brief_summary>The study compare safety efficacy investigation nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) , dexelvucitabine ( DFC ) , approve NRTI , lamivudine ( 3TC ) HIV treatment-experienced patient resistant 3 class antiretroviral therapy ( NRTIs , PIs NNRTIs ) . Patients meet eligibility requirement new 'optimized ' background regimen ( OBR ) select investigator base prior ARV treatment history result HIV genotype phenotype test perform screening period . In addition treatment new OBR , patient randomize receive treatment either DFC 3TC blind fashion . There 50 percent chance patient receive DFC 3TC . Treatment study may continue 96 week . Patients inadequate response therapy 16 week option change OBR option switch receive study medication ( i.e. , DFC 3TC 3TC DFC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized , Double-Blind Study Comparing Dexelvucitabine ( DFC ) Lamivudine ( 3TC ) Subjects With Resistance NRTIs , PIs , NNRTIs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study compare safety efficacy investigational nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) , dexelvucitabine ( DFC ) 200 mg daily , approve NRTI , lamivudine ( 3TC ) 300 mg daily treatment experience patient HIV resistant 3 class antiretroviral therapy ( NRTIs , PIs NNRTIs ) . Patients meet eligibility requirement new 'optimized ' background regimen ( OBR ) select base prior treatment history , result HIV genotype phenotype perform screen . In addition OBR patient randomize receive one one ratio DFC 3TC blind fashion . The OBR may include approved HIV treatment except 3TC , FTC , ddI , d4T ddC . Medications available expanded access may also available select patient . Treatment study continue 96 week primary endpoint 24 48 week therapy . Patients inadequate response therapy 16 week option change OBR option switch study medication ( DFC 3TC 3TC DFC ) . A total 250 patient enrol .</detailed_description>
