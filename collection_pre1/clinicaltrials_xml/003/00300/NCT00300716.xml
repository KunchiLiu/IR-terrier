	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective pilot project conduct clinical trial ass efficacy memantine treatment cognitive dysfunction multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . We hypothesize MS patient cognitive impairment treat memantine demonstrate improvement performance neuropsychological test battery compare placebo treated patient . Background Significance : Cognitive dysfunction major cause disability multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . The estimated prevalence cognitive dysfunction MS population 45 % 65 % . MS patient cognitive dysfunction few social interaction , sexual dysfunction , great difficulty household task higher unemployment normal cognition . At present , effective pharmacological symptomatic treatment cognitive dysfunction MS. One agent may benefit treat condition N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist memantine . Memantine NMDA antagonist show effective treat Alzheimer 's disease . Glutamate toxicity implicate pathogenesis variety neurologic disease , include MS. Glutamate receptor activation may involve mediation neural injury neuronal dysfunction . By block NMDA receptor , memantine may improve neuronal function , explain symptomatic improvement Alzheimer 's patient , slow progressive neuronal death , potentially result slow cognitive decline Alzheimer 's patient . The pathogenesis cognitive dysfunction MS relate least part extent cerebral demyelination , axonal loss atrophy . Some cognitive dysfunction reversible . Reduction inflammation result improvement cognitive performance . What role NMDA receptor glutamate toxicity may play cognitive dysfunction uncertain , give lack treatment cognitive dysfunction MS , perform pilot trial memantine MS clearly warrant . Overall Design : This placebo-controlled , double-blinded , randomize , parallel-group pilot study 16 week duration MS patient cognitive impairment . There 73 patient per treatment arm among site . The intervention arm receive 20 mg memantine day . Randomization treatment arm stratify age CVLT score . A double-blind , placebo control trial critical perform even pilot trial . Both learn placebo effect likely improve cognitive performance subject . An open label trial would likely show improvement patient result would interpretable . Memantine : Both memantine placebo provide Forest Laboratories Inc . Scheduled Visits : Visit 1 : The subject receive consent form . After sign , visual acuity test . The Multiple Sclerosis Screening Neuropsychological Questionnaire ( MSNQ ) Modified Neuropsychiatric Inventory ( MNPI ) give primary caregiver present , patient instruct primary caregiver fill return next visit . They receive first half neuropsychological test battery , include Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test ( PASAT ) California Verbal Learning Test II ( CVLT-II ) . They also receive Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) . Women childbearing potential ask give urine sample pregnancy test ( beta HCG ) . At point , patient inform whether meet full criterion enrollment . If qualify receive second half neuropsychological test ( Controlled Oral Word Association Test , Stroop Color And Word Association Test , Symbol Digit Modalities Test Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System ) . This visit last approximately 1½ hour patient qualify study 2 hour qualify . Visit 2 : The subject receive Fatigue Severity Scale ( FSS ) , Modified Fatigue Impact Scale ( MFIS ) , Medical Outcomes Study 36 Item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) Perceived Deficits Questionnaire ( PDQ ) Multiple Sclerosis Quality Life Inventory ( MSQLI ) . A physical exam neurological exam perform . Memantine placebo pill dispense ; neurological exam include Expanded Disability Status Scale , 25 foot time walk nine-hole peg test . The start dose memantine 5 mg daily . The dose increase 5 mg increment 10 mg/day ( 5 mg twice day ) , 15 mg/day ( 5 mg 10 mg separate dos ) , 20 mg/day ( 10 mg twice day ) 4 week continue 20 mg rest study . In case intolerable side effect titrate dose dose decrease previously tolerate dose . This visit last 1 1/2 hour . Telephone follow-up : Four telephone follow-up visit carried-out enrolled subject Visits 2 3 . These occur two week Visit 2 four , seven , eleven week Visit 2 . These call review study procedure , check compliance report side effect . The person call different person administers neuropsychological test . The total time telephone visit 15 minute . Side effect evaluation visit : If unexpected side effect occur , subject evaluate physical exam neurological exam . This visit last approximately 1 hour . Relapses document adverse event evaluation include EDSS , time walk 9 hole peg test . Visit 3 : Subjects return clinic final assessment 4 week last telephone follow-up visit . At visit , subject complete full neuropsychological test battery . The SF-36 PDQ , BDI , FSS , MFIS administer . The MSNQ MNPI give caregiver . A repeat neurological physical exam perform . This visit last 2 ½ hour .</detailed_description>
