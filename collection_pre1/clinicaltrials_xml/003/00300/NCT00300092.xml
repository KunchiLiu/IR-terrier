	<brief_summary>Study objective : Fingertip injury common pediatric population . Considerable controversy exist whether prophylactic antibiotic necessary repair injury . Our goal estimate rate bacterial infection among pediatric patient distal fingertip injury overall compare rate bacterial infection among subgroup treat without prophylactic antibiotic . Methods : This prospective randomize control study pediatric patient present urban child 's hospital trauma distal fingertip require repair . Patients randomize two group : receive prophylactic antibiotic ( Cephalexin ) receive antibiotic therapy . Repairs perform standardized fashion patient re-evaluated emergency department 48 hour phone 7 day later . The primary outcome study incidence infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MATERIAL METHODS Study design , Setting Selection Participants This prospective randomize control trial conduct urban child 's hospital Emergency Department 56,000 visit annually . The Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve study prior subject enrollment . The study period September 2000 July 2004 . All patient 18 year age present Emergency Department fingertip injury distal distal interphalangeal joint eligible participate . Patients exclude study time injury repair great eight hour , patient diabetes , oncologic disorder , immune deficiency , bleed disorder , use steroid regularly , present grossly contaminate wound , currently take antibiotic , previous allergic reaction cephalosporin . The study formulate equivalence trial demonstrate non-inferiority repair without versus prophylactic antibiotic . The rate infection 7 day repair primary outcome variable . Determination target sample size base combination practicality maximum difference infection rate consistent equivalence . It judge feasible enroll 160 subject course study . Sample size 80 per group would 80 % power conclude 95 % certainty infection rate two group equivalent . This calculation base upper 1-sided 95 % confidence limit difference infection rate , percent infect 6.25 % group , maximum allowable difference result equivalence 10.6 % . Intervention All wound treat follow standardized protocol.9 , 10 First , degree injury record . Fingertips classify one five category : laceration ( damage nailbed ) , simple laceration , loss skin pulp , partial amputation complete amputation . Subungal hematoma drain cautery . Hand x-ray obtain detect fracture , dislocation , foreign body . Lacerations irrigate 500cc normal saline digital block 1 % lidocaine ( epinephrine ) . Devitalized tissue remove . Skin laceration nail bed injury repair chromic gut . Xeroform gauze apply repaired finger bulky dress secure . A tetanus booster give patient 's immunization up-to-date . At discharge study participant give standard wound care instruction sheet schedule follow-up appointment 48 hour . Subjects tell return immediately Emergency Department notice sign symptom infection , include presence redness , warmth , tenderness , swell , discharge fever . All wound repair resident , fellow , and/or attend physician Emergency Department . In-service training provide Emergency Department prior start study periodically study period assure consistency repair process . If wound repair resident fellow , attend Emergency Department provide direct supervision . After standard wound repair , eligible patient ( caregiver ) approach enrollment . Interpreters provide caregiver 's patient 's primary language English . If caregiver appropriate study subject agree , inform consent obtain . Participants randomize one two group use randomization list prepare advance PROC PLAN within Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) .11 Subjects assign Group 1 receive antibiotic fingertip repair . Group 2 receive prophylactic antibiotic ( Cephalexin 50 mg/kg three time daily ) , upon discharge 7 day . Cephalexin choose antibiotic choice majority wound infection cause gram positive organism ( Staphylococcus Streptococcus specie ) . The full 7-day course antibiotic dispense study subject prior discharge . The cost antibiotic cover General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . A 48-hour follow-up visit schedule subject tell one primary investigator would contact phone 7 day . Subjects receive instruction keep hand elevate , keep dress clean dry , leave dressing place return Emergency Department immediately sign symptom wound infection develop . At follow-up visit phone call , one three study investigator evaluate presence infection , compliance antibiotic , wound heal . Infection determine presence erythema , tenderness , warmth , purulent discharge , regional lymphadenopathy , fever . Subject compliance antibiotic regime record 48 hour 7 day repair . Compliance determine phone follow-up ask caregiver measure amount antibiotic leave bottle ask number dos administer . Data Collection Processing Study data collect initial visit physician repair wound . Data 48 hour 7 day phone follow-up collect one three primary investigator . All data record standardized data collection form enter computerized Microsoft Excel spreadsheet . All hospital chart review primary investigator close study quality assurance purpose . Statistical Methods The two group compare age , gender , time injury , place injury , mechanism injury , finger involve , presence fracture , complexity injury , level training treat physician , laceration experience treat physician , number suture place , use 2-sample t-test Wilcoxon rank sum test continuous variable Fisher 's exact test Chi square test categorical variable . The rate infection 7 day repair calculated treatment group , along exact binomial 95 % confidence interval . To assess equivalence two treatment , difference D = infection rate No Antibiotic Group minus infection rate Antibiotic Group calculate . The upper limit 1-sided 95 % confidence interval D use estimate maximum amount infection rate without antibiotic may exceed prophylactic antibiotic . Additional analysis include comparison dropout complete study demographic variable wound repair characteristic , comparison without infection identify potential predictor infection group assignment . NCSS 2004 software use equivalence testing.12 Statistical test compare group characteristic 2-sided consider significant p &lt; 0.05 , use SAS software , version 8.11 DATA ANALYSIS Characteristics Study Subjects A total 146 subject initially enrol study . The study terminate earlier expect staff issue . Eleven participant withdraw prior study completion . Those complete study include four subject could reach phone follow-up , three subject receive antibiotic study period reason infection fingertip , two subject insufficient data available analysis , one subject receive antibiotic prior repair one subject request withdrawn study prior completion . These eleven subject significantly older complete study ( 6.0 +/- 3.8 vs. 3.1 +/- 2.7 year , p=0.001 ) , similar baseline characteristic . In addition , subject equally distribute 2 group : 6/75 ( 8 % ) Group 1 ( No Antibiotic ) 5/71 ( 7 % ) Group 2 ( Antibiotic ) ( p=1.0 ) . A total 135 subject complete study , 69 assign Group 1 ( No Antibiotic ) 66 assign Group 2 ( Antibiotic ) . Baseline characteristic two group show Table 1 . Values tabulate mean + s.d . continuous variable number percent categorical variable . No statistically significant difference baseline value find two treatment group . At 7 day interview , percent report consume least 75 % prescribed dose 86.2 % ( 95 % CI : 75.3 % , 93.5 % ) . Results At 7 day repair , one subject treatment group infection . The subject No Antibiotic Group treat oral antibiotic subject Antibiotic Group treat intravenous antibiotic . Both make full recovery . The infection rate ( 95 % confidence interval ) 1.45 % ( 0.04 % , 7.81 % ) No Antibiotic Group 1.52 % ( 0.04 % , 8.16 % ) Antibiotic Group , statistically significant ( p=1.00 ) . The upper limit 1-sided 95 % confidence interval difference rate 4.9 % indicate 5 % chance infection rate subject treat antibiotic would exceed subject treat antibiotic 4.9 % . Although number infection small meaningful statistical comparison , examination two infected case reveal number suture considerably large among uninfected subject . The number suture two infected subject 8 9 ( mean=8.5 ; standard deviation=0.7 ) mean ( S.D . ) uninfected subject 4.9 ( 2.0 ) . After completion study , chart review reveal four infection present beyond seven-day window ( Days 7-14 ) , three Antibiotic Group one No Antibiotic group . Interestingly , 41 % wound involved fracture none become infected .</detailed_description>
