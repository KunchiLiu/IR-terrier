	<brief_title>Left Main Coronary Artery Stenosis Angioplasty With Taxus Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery bypass graft reference treatment leave main coronary artery disease . With advancement technology particularly drug-eluting stent , in-stent restenosis dramatically decrease possible extend indication complexes lesion leave main coronary artery stenosis . In particular situation , center perform percutaneous coronary angioplasty ( PCI ) drug-eluting stent acceptable result term safety efficacy . However , procedure perform isolated site evaluate multicenter trial.The aim study assess safety efficacy PCI Taxus-stent french multicenter trial evaluate clinical angiographic outcome patient long-term follow-up .</detailed_description>
