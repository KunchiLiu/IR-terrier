	<brief_summary>About 90 % patient haemato-oncologic malignancy lose body muscle mass also lose weight either due chemotherapy induce nausea/vomiting high catabolic state due fever , sepsis chemotherapy . This impact tremendously day hospital also treatment-related complication . Studies Human Growth hormone ( hGH ) show increase lean body mass adult patient AIDS animal model cancer . At time , vitro study show hGH effect tumor cell growth . This study design see use hGH immunocompromised patient haematological malignancy prevents loss muscle mass weight loss extent . This blind 1:1 , randomise study include 150 patient whereby patient either receive hGH placebo . The doctor nurse know drug patient receiving . Both hGH placebo give intravenously ( patient receive intravenous antibiotic haemopoietic support ) subcutaneously ( platelet 20 x 109/L ) The treatment start first day treatment continue 6 week .</brief_summary>
