	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Bamako , Mali ( West Africa ) , collect blood sputum sample establish normal value laboratory test result among Malians . Researchers start new initiative study HIV tuberculosis Africa , use Mali model country . In order perform study , scientist need know constitute normal laboratory value among population . People develop country may dramatically different laboratory value live developed country , currently little information available distinguish normal abnormal result Malians . This study establish normal range provide basis future HIV tuberculosis research Mali . Additionally provide blood sputum sample researcher study different scientific question relate HIV Tuberculosis infection . Healthy volunteer people infect HIV tuberculosis , , 18 year age older live Bamako , Mali , may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test . Participants provide blood sputum sample , , laboratory analysis . Blood collect needle insert arm vein , sputum collect participant cough deeply spit cup . Participants may agree provide sample one time return visit basis . Returning visit may schedule daily weekly . Subjects may continue participate duration 4-year study , provide medical history physical examination update year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV tuberculosis major health issue develop world - HIV tuberculosis affect several million people worldwide . Individually together two disease kill people infection , bad suffer occur African continent . Mali West African state awakening reality issue . While tuberculosis always major problem Mali , recently HIV incidence begin increase . We commence new research initiative study HIV tuberculosis Africa , use Mali model country . However , little baseline epidemiological , hematological , immunological microbiological data help distinguish normal abnormal result ; establish normal population baseline value necessary facilitate future research . We collect whole blood sputum sample establish baseline value , purpose facilitate ongoing future HIV tuberculosis research . Specifically , sample use determine normal hematological , immunological parameter Malian people . In addition , use sample optimize routine specialize research assay . Sputum sample use bacteriological genetic study intend optimize study relate tuberculosis .</detailed_description>
