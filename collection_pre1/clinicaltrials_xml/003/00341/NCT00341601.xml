	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Korea , examine people susceptible tuberculosis ( TB ) others strain M tuberculosis ( bacteria cause TB ) difficult treat become resistant drug treatment . The study compare blood sample medical information patient different kind tuberculosis healthy volunteer identify patient bacterial characteristic contribute disease susceptibility , treatment failure , disease recurrence multi-drug resistance . Healthy volunteer patient tuberculosis 20 year age old may eligible study . Subjects recruit among patient receive treatment tuberculosis National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital Republic Korea healthy people visit government health care center annual medical checkup . The latter include people TB cure ; people expose TB , currently sign disease ; expose TB . Participants tuberculosis undergo follow test procedure : - Medical history , include past treatment TB , review medical record - Interview home work - Sputum collection test kind TB bacteria present genetic study bacteria - Drug treatment TB - Blood draws part regular patient care , HIV testing , genetic study - Chest x-rays part routine patient care - In patient recurrent disease , examination strain bout disease determine recurrence organism infection new strain . Healthy volunteer undergo follow test procedure : - Brief medical history - Blood draw look exposure TB genetic study - Review previous x-ray look active TB</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This natural history study seek determine mycobacterial host factor involve failure antituberculous chemotherapy , disease recurrence , development multidrug resistance M. tuberculosis . Despite optimal treatment directly-observed short-course therapy ( DOTS ) , 5-10 % compliant patient `` cure '' tuberculosis relapse , usually within year completion therapy . In Korea , DOTS practice , relapse rate report 15 20 % . In individual patient , failure eradicate disease contribute directly development drug-resistance low overall cure rate . While factor patient drug compliance HIV status extensively study relation rate relapse ; host genetic factor specific relevance infect mycobacterial strain yet investigate detail . Identification patient characteristic specific strain M. tuberculosis associate relapse evolution drug resistance would greatly facilitate development treatment protocol might avoid complication . Our study population consist subject pulmonary tuberculosis receive treatment study site . Healthy volunteer select genotypic control population . All subject tuberculosis enrol study follow periodic chart review data extraction treatment follow-up participating study site . For 2.5 year complete drug treatment , tuberculosis recurrence among study subject identify use periodic chart abstraction follow-up phone call every 6 month determine 2 year recurrence rate tuberculosis ( TB ) . M. tuberculosis isolates may collect subject recurrent TB analyze distinguish relapse re-infection . Study subject ask provide 10 mL blood 5 30 mL sputum acid-fast bacillus ( AFB ) smear culture entry . Sputum culture M. tuberculosis isolates test drug resistance ( DR ) . The research staff may use molecular DR test confirm agar-growth DR result . In addition , subject ask series medical history question include history prior tuberculosis , antituberculous treatment , disease contact , risk factor associate tuberculosis ; ask give consent allow clinical research staff abstract treatment regimen result inpatient outpatient medical chart duration participation study ( treatment follow-up ) .</detailed_description>
