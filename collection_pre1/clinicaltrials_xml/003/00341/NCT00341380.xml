	<brief_summary>This study investigate operative technique reduce risk tumor spread result lung cancer surgery . Recent study indicate tumor cell may release bloodstream due handle lung surgery , cause disease spread patient whose tumor previously confine lung . This study examine whether order pulmonary vein ( vessel carry blood lung heart ) artery ( vessel carry blood heart lung ) tie surgery affect risk tumor spread disease recurrence . Patients 18 year age older operable Stage I Stage II non-small cell lung cancer evidence tumor spread beyond lung may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , blood test , chest X-ray , possibly mediastinal evaluation . This test involve insert tube chest cavity look sign disease spread beyond lung . All participant undergo standard surgery lung cancer . During procedure , pulmonary artery pulmonary vein tie ; study , patient randomly assign either artery vein ligate first . Patients follow every 6 month two year blood test X-rays look disease recurrence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The VALID study design obtain information regard factor associate risk recurrence resection early stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . Until recently , clearly identify prognostic factor stage disease . Recent development sensitive molecular assay provide way study effect circulate tumor cell clinical outcome . Preliminary study show tumor cell detect mean lymph node bone marrow associate increase risk recurrence . Preliminary study also indicate level circulate tumor cell blood stream effect intraoperative factor , i.e . sequence vessel ligation . The main objective study investigate influence intraoperative sequence vessel ligation affect tumor recurrence survival . In addition , also investigate use molecular assay detect circulate tumor cell surrogate endpoint occurrence distant metastasis and/or death surgery NSCL . Several molecular marker proven value case series rigorously test association clinical endpoint interest , tumor recurrence survival . We believe study may lead important answer spread tumor cell occur novel detection method use predict patient outcome .</detailed_description>
