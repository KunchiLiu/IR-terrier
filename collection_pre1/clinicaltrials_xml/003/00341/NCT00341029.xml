	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Duke University Durham , NC , determine whether drug Adderall methylphenidate affect genetic material child attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . One small study show take methylphenidate ADHD may result high level certain type change genetic material contain white blood cell . The change see directly link increase risk disease , indicate possibility kind damage may link increased disease may result take methylphenidate . The study also examine whether type change might occur child treat Adderall . Children age 6 12 symptom ADHD may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , psychiatric examination , IQ test , physical examination , electrocardiogram . Parents teacher complete questionnaire rate severity child 's ADHD . Qualified child diagnose ADHD appropriate candidate treatment either Adderall methylphenidate-based drug ( e.g. , Concerta , Metadate , Focalin , Ritalin Ritalin LA ) may select study . At baseline visit ( Visit 0 ) , parent complete questionnaire rate severity child 's ADHD . The child vital sign check ( pulse , blood pressure , breathe rate , height , weight temperature ) blood sample drawn . The child randomly assign treatment either Adderall methylphenidate product . After baseline visit , participant undergo follow test procedure : Dose Optimization Visits ( visit 1-4 ) In first 4 week study , dose methylphenidate Adderall adjust weekly doctor determine dose strength work best individual child . In addition , follow procedure do visit : - Child 's vital sign check . - Parents complete questionnaire severity child 's ADHD . - Parent child describe impact symptom child 's functioning . - Parents complete form common side effect study drug . Follow-up Visits ( visit 5-6 ) Children return clinic month ass health adjust medication dose , need . The visit similar dose optimization period , follow additional procedure visit 6 : - A blood sample obtain measure whether medication affect child 's genetic material . - A physical examination do check child 's health . - Information provide parent assist plan child 's treatment study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Longitudinal observational study pediatric ADHD patient , subtype . This study part large comprehensive investigation initiate fund National Institute Child Health Human Development aid understanding report association methylphenidate treatment elevate frequency type chromosome damage . Population : 60 diagnose ADHD child , age range 6-12 year inclusive , pharmacological treatment stimulant medication indicate . 30 child initiate treatment methylphenidate-based product 30 initiate treatment Adderall Adderall-XR . Study group assignment randomize , two drug consider clinical community fully interchangeable . Primary Objective : To determine frequency micronuclei ( marker numerical structural chromosomal damage ) , sister chromatid exchange ( indicator DNA damage ) , chromosomal aberration lymphocytes pediatric ADHD patient prior 3 month uninterrupted drug therapy . These endpoint , time frame , compatible investigate effect initiation phase treatment ; additional study NIH institute ( NIMH , CDC ) investigate effect chronic treatment stimulant medication comprehensive picture potential treatment-induced chromosomal damage ADHD subject obtain . Secondary Objective : In pediatric ADHD patient treat methylphenidate-based product Adderall , determine flow cytometric measurement frequency micronucleated erythrocyte serve biomarker cytogenetic damage lymphocyte evaluate standard light microscope technique .</detailed_description>
