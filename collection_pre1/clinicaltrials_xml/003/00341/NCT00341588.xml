	<brief_summary>The incidence testicular germ cell tumor ( TGCT ) increase twentieth century particular concern primarily affect young men . It common cancer among U.S. male age 25-34 . The well-described risk factor cryptorchism ( undescended testis ) , family history TGCT , personal history TGCT . To good understand environmental genetic determinant TGCT risk , case-control study conduct among member U.S. arm force . The study include men donate blood sample Department Defense Serum Repository ( DoDSR ) 1989 2000 . All DoDSR donor develop GCT match DoDSR donor develop TGCT . Approximately 1,080 men TGCT , 1,080 control , 2,160 mother include study . The DoDSR serum sample test organochlorines level , gonadotropin level , viral antibody titre . Each participant donate saliva specimen use examination genetic susceptibility . Each participant also complete questionnaire concern variety possible risk factor physical activity , medical history , medication history , risk factor . The mother participant invited participate completing questionnaire concern perinatal exposure event donate saliva sample . The three main objective study : - determine whether environmental endocrine modulators ( i.e. , chlorinate pesticide polychlorinated biphenyls ) relate risk GCT , , whether effect augment risk factor . - determine whether genetic susceptibility GCT exist characterize environmental risk factor related susceptibility . - determine whether distinct cause GCT relate tissue structure tumor risk factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence testicular germ cell tumor ( TGCT ) increase good part twentieth century particular concern primarily affect young men . Though tumor relatively infrequent population whole , TGCT common cancer among U.S. male age group 15-34 year . Despite increase TGCT rate , etiology still poorly understood . The well describe risk factor TGCT cryptorchism , family history TGCT personal history TGCT . Therefore , order understand well environmental genetic determinant TGCT risk , case-control study conduct among member U.S. Armed Forces . The study include men donate blood sample Department Defense Serum Repository ( DoDSR ) year 1989 2003 . All DoDSR donor develop GCT match DoDSR donor develop TGCT . A total 1682 serviceman enrol study ; 754 case 928 control . Of participant , 1303 men ( 77 % , 590 case , 713 control ) donate buccal cell sample . In addition serviceman , total 1090 mother servicemen enrol 952 ( 87 % ) provide buccal specimen . The DoDSR serum sample assay level organochlorines pesticide , polychlorinated biphenyl congener , insulin-like growth factor gonadotropins steroid hormone . DNA isolate buccal cell specimen thus far genotyped polymorphysms hormone metabolism immune function pathway , immune function pathway , insulin-like growth factor pathway single nucleotide polymorphisms 8q24 locus . In addition , genome-wide association study complete . Statistical analysis questionnaire data continue .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The identification men diagnosis testicular germ cell tumor ( TCGT ) accomplish link database maintain Department Defense . Potential case initially identify Defense Medical Surveillance System ( DMSS ) . Matched control identify DMSS . Criteria Cases include : Age 17 45 year time confirm TGCT diagnosis . Age least 18 year time study enrollment . The existence prediagnostic serum sample 1mL great DoDSR . On active duty time diagnosis . Donated serum sample DoDSR year 1989 2003 . Criteria Control Identification : Case subject match case men age , ethnicity , date serum donation men DoDSR never diagnosis TGCT ( control men ) . Criteria Control Men include : No previous diagnosis TGCT . Donated serum sample DpDSR year 1989 2003 . Alive study initiation . On active duty time case 's diagnosis .</criteria>
