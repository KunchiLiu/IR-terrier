	<brief_summary>This study conduct University Hospital Lund University Malmo , Sweden , collaboration U.S. National Institute Child Health Human Development . The study try identify genetic cause impaired sperm production male infertility . It focus possible role MTHFR CBS gene , regulate absorption metabolism vitamin , folate infertility . If nutritional intake metabolism vitamin relate male infertility , cause infertility would potentially curable . Fertile infertile men 20 45 year age may eligible study . Criteria include follow : - Fertile men : men whose partner young age 40 attend Lund University prenatal clinic ; father one pregnancy stop birth control achieve present pregnancy ; achieve present pregnancy le 12 month unprotected intercourse . - Infertile men : men refer Scandian Andrology Centre whose infertility unexplained , whose partner young age 40 regular sexual intercourse without contraception least 12 month without achieve pregnancy . All participant follow test procedure : - Complete questionnaire provide information reproductive medical history recent dietary history ; - Provide blood sample analysis red cell folate , plasma folate , plasma homocysteine , plasma B12 , genetic evaluation ; - Provide semen sample routine analysis , include volume , sperm concentration , sperm motility , sperm morphology . In addition , infertile men undergo physical examination review medical record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It evident genetic variation play substantial role etiology male infertility . Studies child father intracytoplasmic sperm injection ICSI reveal mutation AZF region Y chromosome link male infertility . Mutations gene may also involve . Candidates would include gene androgen receptor , follicle-stimulating hormone , luteinizing hormone , gene involve regulation spermatogenesis sperm motility . Mutations mitochondrial DNA link poor sperm motility raise possibility type male subfertility may inherit female line . We propose assess role folate/homocysteine status MTHFR CBS gene variant infertile men Sweden know cause infertility whose wives/partners appear fertile . We propose perform study Sweden since Sweden , unlike U.S. , present mandate enrichment flour foodstuff folate .</detailed_description>
