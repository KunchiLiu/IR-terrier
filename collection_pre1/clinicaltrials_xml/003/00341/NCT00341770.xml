We plan perform direct microelectrode nerve record sympathetic innervation lower leg directly assess SNS activity examine potential role regulation metabolic rate development obesity . Measurements perform basal state , response glucose feeding ( 75 g OGTT ) , response standard meal , response glucose/insulin infusion . These study also help disassociate effect insulin glucose stimulation SNS activity . The association postprandial change SNS activity subjective rating hunger fullness also study .
