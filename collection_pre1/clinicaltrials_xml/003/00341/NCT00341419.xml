	<brief_summary>This study characterize gene mutation responsible pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( PXE ) correlate disease manifestation males female . PXE inherit disorder affect connective tissue part body . Calcium mineral deposit connective tissue , cause change skin , eye , cardiovascular system gastrointestinal system . Some effect PXE cause serious medical problem , others less impact . Symptoms often appear earlier severe female male , way predict disorder progress give individual . Candidates study recruit PXE International , organization provide patient support support research disease . The organization collect biological sample medical information patient family member help research disease . Families sample patient , parent , least one sibling may eligible study . Grandparents extend family member may include certain instance . Participants provide blood sample , sample cell scrap inside cheek ( buccal cell ) medical history . The sample analyze gene variant finding correlate disease sign symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Pseudoxanthoma elasticum ( PXE ) autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterize mutation ATP-binding cassette transporter , ABCC6 . - PXE know patient two mutate allele ABCC6 gene , significant question remain segregation disease , presentation male versus female correlation mutation clinical phenotype . Objectives : - The objective examine role variant ABCC6 gene PXE . Eligibility : - Samples study participant obtain PXE International BioBank . - Families select sample parent least one sibling addition proband . Design : - Participants DNA sequence identify variant genotyped link marker follow segregation mutant allele compare result clinical outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A representative set collect family study . No subject within family exclude . Families select sample parent least one sibling addition proband . The sibling include affected unaffected . If grandparent available also type help phase determination . Extended relative select multiple generation family .</criteria>
