	<detailed_description>Background : Uterine leiomyomas lead cause hysterectomy United States , account 200,000 procedure year . Most epidemiologic study uterine leiomyoma show parity protective association leiomyoma , mechanism know . Both epidemiologic data data animal model indicate protective association artifact result reduce fertility among woman fibroid . We hypothesize process uterine regression follow delivery result loss small fibroid due selective apoptosis transform cell extensive remodel entire uterus . Study Objectives : Monitor fibroid pregnancy postpartum uterine regression ass loss fibroid change size fibroid . Methods : Add postpartum ultrasound examination exist epidemiologic study pregnant woman . The parent study document fibroid number , size , location 7 week ultrasound examination . With additional postpartum ultrasound propose , data fibroid number , size , location pregnancy postpartum uterine regression collect approximately 400 woman . A subsample 30 woman also MRI postpartum ultrasound order evaluate sensitivity ultrasound image . Significance : This study provide first data fibroid change parturition/postpartum uterine regression large sample woman . If small fibroid disappear time , document process result `` natural regression '' tumor premenopausal woman . Insights biology process may useful develop treatment could use nonpregnant woman fibroid induce tumor regression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants Right From The Start Study must 18 year old old , pregnant , enrol 10 week gestation , plan carry pregnancy term , plan move delivery , English speaking . Those found fibroid either 7week , 22week ultrasound examination eligible postpregnancy study . A small substudy 30 woman MRIs evaluate sensitivity ultrasound image include participant single fibroid find early pregnancy ultrasound . EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR MRI : Exclusion criterion MRI weight great 250 pound , currently pregnant , metal specific type body ( artificial hip , clip brain aneurysm , medical implant ear , metal fragment eye , pacemaker ) , history claustrophobia , previous severe reaction MRI contrast , chronic kidney disease . A severe reaction would consist bronchospasm ( shortness breath/difficulty breathe ) shock ( sudden loss blood pressure ) . Risk le 1/100,000 Gd base contrast material . Any potential subject history kidney disease exclude study .</criteria>
