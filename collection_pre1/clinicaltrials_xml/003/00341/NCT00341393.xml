	<brief_summary>This study evaluate system predict effectiveness antiretroviral treatment African HIV clinic standard test method measure viral load , RNA polymerase chain reaction , available affordable . Without accurate test monitor viral load , treatment decision often base insufficient clinical immunologic information . This study see combine analysis patient ' antiretroviral treatment history , adherence treatment , clinical finding simple laboratory test predict whether treatment effectively lower viral load . An effective monitoring system could reduce number patient keep ineffective treatment prolong period time well reduce development drug resistance . HIV-infected patient 18 year age old follow Adult Infectious Disease Clinic Makerere University , Kampala , Uganda , take antiretroviral treatment 6 month may eligible study . Participants ' medical chart review medical history take , include question treatment history , adherence treatment , change symptoms . A blood sample drawn determine viral load , CD4+ CBC count , , necessary , anti-viral resistance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Routine virological monitoring HIV-infected patient antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) currently affordable available African HIV clinic use standard method RNA polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Alternative cheap technology quantify viral load still await . Therefore majority patient monitor clinically sometimes immunologically . Decisions switch second-line ART treatment failure base upon insensitive ( virological failure ) clinical immunological criterion , suggest World Health Organization ( WHO ) . We hypothesize use combination detail treatment adherence history change clinical laboratory parameter , virological failure success may predict majority patient take ART typical African HIV clinic . Using monitor algorithm patient classify accord likelihood failure , would possible reduce number viral load require ART clinic time increase detection fail virologically , enable switch new effective regimen earlier would possible use WHO criteria . Therefore , protocol team propose cross-sectional study patient treat busy African HIV clinic . We include protease-inhibitor ( PI ) -naive patient first-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) base ART treatment 6 month . Each patient undergo structure interview , note review blood take complete blood count , CD4+ , viral load genotypic phenotypic anti-viral resistance testing ( necessary ) . Treatment , adherence , clinical laboratory parameter would individually collectively assessed ability predict virological failure use various statistical procedure include classification regression tree ( CART ) analysis . From , monitor algorithm would refine . Its performance would compare current WHO recommendation switch therapy see proportion patient fail virologically could switch earlier use system extra cost . Such monitoring system could reduce number patient allow fail first-line regimen prolong period time , affordable increase cost . This could , therefore , reduce evolution transmission drug resistance significantly prolong effectiveness roll ART Africa .</detailed_description>
