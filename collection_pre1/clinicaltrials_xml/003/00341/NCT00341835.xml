	<brief_summary>This study search gene greatly increase risk develop lung cancer conjunction cigarette smoke environmental agent , . Lung cancer second common cancer diagnose among men woman lead cause cancer death United States . It frequently give example cancer determine environment , certain occupation , dietary habit . Yet researcher long hypothesis people vary risk become affect exposed factor . Also , evidence show lung cancer family may due combined effect inheritance major gene cigarette smoking . Individuals confirm diagnosis lung cancer family history lung cancer may eligible enroll family study . Family member ask one following : - Complete questionnaire personal medical history , lifestyle , diet . - Have blood draw vein arm . - If family member biopsy schedule one , give permission obtain medical record portion store tissue . - If relative die cancer , sign release form allow researcher get copy medical pathology record , tissue sample surgery . If family member agree , may recontacted answer question health family , annual telephone conversation . Follow-up questionnaire may send participant , determine new cancer develop family . In event new cancer , classification family may change low-risk intermediate risk-level intermediate-risk high-risk level . Follow-up continue , get information tumor death . Also , newsletter lung cancer family occasionally distribute participant . In future , Internet also provide information family .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death US , represent significant burden health care resource . Accumulated evidence suggest genetic susceptibility component lung cancer , gene-environment interaction important . While major breakthrough make understanding genetic susceptibility basis cancer , study identify specific major locus affection lung cancer risk notably lack . The high case fatality rate ( 14 percent 5-year survival rate ) low resection rate ( 25 percent ) make study lung cancer family particularly challenge difficult collect adequate number biospecimens DNA analysis . Only collaborative effort identify , accrue , genotype familial lung cancer ( FLC ) family successful characterize genetic basis familial lung cancer . This project part multi-center , multi-investigator , interdisciplinary team highly experience genetic epidemiology , gene mapping , lung biology , cancer molecular genetics , know Genetic Epidemiology Lung Cancer Consortium ( GELCC ) form identify lung cancer susceptibility gene ( ) estimate gene-environment interaction etiology neoplasm order elucidate strategy prevention , control clinical management disease identification genetically high-risk individual . Confirmation genetic predisposition lung cancer may possible use linkage analysis localize putative susceptibility gene specific chromosomal region . The strength linkage analysis dependent upon recruitment multiple large kindred tissue sample available history tumor incidence exist two , preferably , generation . Our strategy combine informative pedigree preferably eventually 500 pedigree . This strategy yield substantial increase power cost-effectiveness usual strategy site work independently genotyping many marginally informative family . To date strategy appear successful , result first 52 genotyped family result significant evidence favor linkage region chromosome 6q suggestive evidence several region . We believe ongoing data collection analysis preliminary result also fruitful . Recently , National Cancer Institute fund ongoing project competitive renewal ( 5 year ) multi-center R01 support data collection work sit besides NHGRI NCI . All data collection direction P.I . data collection site fund respective grant contract . NHGRI investigator contact study subject NHGRI employee receive fund grant . Because disorder complex high likelihood cause multiple locus , multiple parametric non-parametric method analysis employ . Heterogeneity take account analysis , environmental covariates , effect smoking . Only statistical analysis perform NHGRI site , laboratory work range genotyping , sequence , array CGH , model organism experiment method occurs site part collaboration .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All individual histologically confirm diagnosis lung cancer family lung cancer eligible enroll family study . Five major histologic type lung cancer , i.e. , adenocardinoma , squamous cell , small cell , large cell , unspecified nonsmall cell carcinoma include . In addition lung cancer patient , LSU also contact patient newly diagnose bronchus tracheal cancer target hospital area request enrollment study . In addition , several site include LSU , Mayo Clinic Karmanos Cancer Institute also collect DNA sample unaffected , geographically ethnically match control . For purpose study , eligible family must meet minimum criterion familial lung cancer : least 2 firstdegree relative family lung cancer . Priority give highly loaded pedigree family affect person onset disease early age ( less 50 year ) . Lung cancer case may live deceased . Relatives lung cancer define first seconddegree relative cousins index case eligible participate study familial relationship might provide useful linkage information . Adult participant must physically able tolerate removal 25 40 ml blood , buccal brush sample cheek . Children 5 year old must able physically tolerate amount blood draw equal 4ml/kg weight . Adults must willing complete selfadministered environmental exposure questionnaire , participant must able consent study procedure ( appropriate assent/parental consent ) . Biological specimen , include blood sample , archive tumor block medical record obtain patient treat various hospital collection sit individual strong family history lung cancer ( either affect unaffected ) either selfreferred physician refer study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Excluded study family individual within family meet minimum criterion describe . Individuals sign Consent Form exclude , family necessary member sign Consent Form may exclude . MAYO also exclude patient ( 1 ) speak English , ( 2 ) nonUS citizen resident ( 3 ) diagnose uncommon tumor type among specified type ( e.g . ) mix cell unspecified nonsmall cell lung cancer , carcinoid , sarcoma lymphoma lung bronchus ) . This do MAYO family study piggyback onto casecontrol study . No fetus , prisoner institutionalize individual enrol . While study target pregnant woman , contact many family mail able exclude pregnant woman . Additionally , participant 's physician health care clinic draw blood sample longdistance participant therefore determine risk woman fetus . UMHS also exclude child research participant site .</criteria>
