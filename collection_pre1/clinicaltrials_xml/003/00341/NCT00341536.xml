	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Prospective Diet Lifestyle Cohorts Delhi , Kerala , Kolkota , India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Cancer research develop country receive adequate attention spite great potential improve understanding gene environmental exposure diet etiology cancer . Specifically , Indian dietary cohort would substantially expand intake range variety different food lifestyles adequately explore , e.g. , spice , type oil , lentil , vegetarianism ( tie religion rather healthy life-style ) , type physical activity . Indians also distinct cancer incidence pattern . Establishing cohort allow u study multiple cancer outcomes well disease end-points ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease diabetes ) , avoid potential bias result differential recall past diet subject , critical concern case-control study assess nutritional intake . As measurement various biological marker integral component study , important collect biological specimen prior illness treatment . This particularly important India case may present late stage disease . Because study magnitude complexity carry India , I propose pilot study determine feasibility conduct large cohort study India . The pilot study consist three part : 1 ) evaluation logistical issue ; 2 ) characterization diet ; 3 ) evaluation issue relate follow-up end-point ascertainment . In Part A pilot study 4,000 subject . This part study evaluate logistical issue , include questionnaire administration , collection , storage , analysis . Response rate questionnaire , collection biospecimens center ability carry propose research evaluate well . Part B pilot study consist characterization Indian diet determine within- between-person variability intake subset 1,400 subject ; evaluation determine whether Indians estimate food quantity accurately ; assess degree measurement error select nutrient ; ascertain whether use multiple form intake instrument combination biomarkers may categorize intake less error . In Part C pilot study , issue relate follow-up end-point ascertainment 1200 subject evaluate . In addition , evaluation likelihood cancer chronic disease remain completely undiagnosed owning lack access health care ; ass movement pattern traceability Indian population ; well evaluation cancer registry coverage determine whether supplementary activity require .</detailed_description>
