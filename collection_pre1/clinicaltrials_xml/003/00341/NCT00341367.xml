	<brief_summary>This study attempt identify gene may increase decrease likelihood sciatic pain ( shoot pain leg ) persist 1 year treatment herniated spinal disc . Many protein nerve , spinal cord , brain involved processing pain . These protein vary slightly different people . Animal study show rat mice certain type proteins experience chronic pain sciatic injury type . Better information role gene pain processing may lead test risk chronic pain specific individual effective treatment approach . This study include people participate Maine Lumbar Pain Study natural history spinal pain . The Maine study include patient treat sciatic pain cause herniated disc . In study , patient improve medical treatment refer surgery remove disc . Of referred surgery , 275 elect operation , 232 . One year surgical consultation , leg pain reduce 81 percent patient underwent surgery . Of declined surgery , 56 percent improve 1 year . This study look genetic difference non-surgical group might reveal difference among improve . Participants provide blood sample ( approximately 2 tablespoon ) genetic test . They also provide information ethnic background parent grandparent . Different gene variant occur different ethnic group , information ethnic background help researcher know gene variant look . Participants complete questionnaire smoking history , protein brain responds nicotine may also play part decrease increase pain . Also , surgeon believe smoke interfere spinal bone healing . Information study help resolve question .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many patient persistent pain one year herniated lumbar disc even disc surgically remove shrink spontaneously . We hypothesize risk persistent pain modify common variation gene relate inflammation pain processing . We propose collect blood DNA analysis 500 patient follow 10 year onset severe sciatica Maine Lumbar Spine Study . Based pain research literature , Human Genome database , gene study NIAAA 's Laboratory Neurogenetics , prioritize approximately 100 candidate gene variant affect function protein . We type patient ' DNA variant compare clinical data genotype candidate gene see common variant increase decrease risk chronic pain . The primary phenotype variable amount persistent leg pain one year pain onset , Identification association , replicate future study , may help prioritize target drug treatment identify genetic test predict prognosis acute sciatica assist treatment choice .</detailed_description>
