	<brief_summary>The Polish breast , ovarian endometrial cancer study complex molecular epidemiologic study expect enroll 2,500 breast cancer , 450 ovarian 450 endometrial cancer case 2,500 control Warsaw Lodz , two major city Poland . This large population-based study combine state-of-the-art technique exposure assessment collection biological specimen allow study wide range biomarkers . Exposure information obtain detailed personal interview , anthropometric measurement , physical activity monitor , collection dust sample participant home . The collection biological specimen include blood sample process cryopreserved whole blood , serum+ blood clot , plasma+buffy coat+red blood cell ; 12-hour overnight urine ; paraffin embed tumor normal tissue ; fresh tissue tumor , non-neoplastic breast tissue mammary fat tissue . Subject enrollment start June 2000 expect continue January 2003 breast cancer case control June 2003 ovarian endometrial cancer case . As May 2002 , identify 2,207 breast , 138 ovarian 235 endometrial cancer case 2,327 control . The response rate interview 81 % breast , 90 % ovarian 83 % endometrial cancer case 70 % control . Most woman agree interview agree provide biological specimen ( 90 % cancer case control agree provide blood sample ) , anthropometric measurement ( 95 % breast cancer case control ) wear physical activity monitor ( 79 % breast cancer case 90 % control ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Polish breast , ovarian endometrial cancer study complex molecular epidemiologic study conduct two major city Poland ( Warsaw Lodz ) enrol 2,386 breast cancer case 2,503 control , expect enroll 400 ovarian , 600 endometrial cancer case 600 additional control September 2004 . This large population-based study combine state-of-the art technique exposure assessment collection biological specimen allow study wide range biomarkers . Exposure information obtain detailed personal interview , anthropometric measurement , physical activity monitor , collection dust sample participant ' home . The collection biological specimen include blood sample process cryopreserved whole blood , serum+ blood clot , plasma+buffy coat+red blood cell ; 12-hour overnight urine ; paraffin embed tumor normal tissue ; fresh tissue tumor , non-neoplastic breast tissue mammary fat tissue . Subject enrollment start June 1 , 2000.The last day diagnosis eligible breast cancer case December 31 , 2003 . The final response rate interview breast cancer component study 79 % breast cancer case 69 % control . Among woman agree interview , agree provide biological specimen ( 84 % breast cancer case 92 % control agree provide blood sample ; 82 % case 89 % control agree provide urine sample ) , anthropometric measurement ( 95 % breast cancer case 93 % control ) wear physical activity monitor ( 76 % breast cancer case 84 % control Warsaw study site ) . The final participation rate interview ovarian endometrial component study 78 % ovarian , 80 % endometrial cancer case . Of woman , 85 % ovarian 86 % endometrial cancer case agree provide blood sample . Urine sample , anthropmetric measurement , physical activity monitor data collect ovarian endometrial case . We currently work first manuscripts breast cancer component study . We complete DNA extraction first genotype assay . In addition , construct tissue microarrays use formalin fix tumor sample breast cancer case invasive cancer perform number immunohistochemical/immunofluorescence stain evaluate etiologic heterogeneity breast cancer risk factor tumor type . For ovarian/endometrial component study , complete DNA extraction subject , incite first analyse endometrial study . Determination first genotypes ovarian/endometrial component construction tissue microarrays endometrial case plan 2005- 06 .</detailed_description>
