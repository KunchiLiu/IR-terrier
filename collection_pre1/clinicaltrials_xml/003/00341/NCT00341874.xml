	<brief_summary>The incidence hearing impairment India Pakistan high United States . This attribute several factor , include infection high rate inbreeding may result homozygosity rare recessive mutation . The average family size large India Pakistan compare United States . In addition , 1 billion people India population size Pakistan approximately 148 million . The ability detect linkage greatly enhance extend inbred family . It estimate many 45 % - 60 % marriage Pakistan close relative ( vast majority marriage first cousin ) . While percentage consanguineous marriage high India compare Pakistan , population size India much large . Hearing impairment result abnormal ear development , abnormal ear function yet little known molecular mechanism involve development homeostasis inner ear . Although gene several recessive deafness locus identify , still many family segregate deafness ascribe one currently know gene . The purpose study continue identify gene cause nonsyndromic hereditary hearing impairment enrol family segregate deafness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Syndrome Hereditary Hearing Impairment - Gene Mapping : India/Pakistan Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : One objective study genetically map identify mutate gene human hereditary hearing loss . A second objective study function gene auditory system use mouse model . Human hereditary hearing impairment result abnormal ear development , abnormal ear function . Although gene numerous deafness locus map identify , still many family segregate deafness monogenic trait mutant allele ascribe one currently report deafness gene . In order map identify novel mutate gene associate hearing loss human , continue ascertain large family segregate syndromic nonsyndromic deafness monogenic trait . Study population : This study ascertain subject consanguineous Pakistani family segregate hearing loss consist nonsyndromic syndromic form deafness genetic etiology . Since majority Pakistani marriage first cousin , tend bring together recessive mutation hear loss multiple affected individual within single family line , advantage genetic study . A year ago stop ascertain family India . We continue ascertain affected unaffected Pakistani family member age 2 year . Adults provide inform consent child agree participate study . We ascertain gender Pakistani race ethnicity . Design : Subjects screen consented collaborate Associate Investigator Pakistan . After consent , subject undergo history physical , audiological assessment testing , vestibular assessment testing , blood urine analysis test , along blood sample buccal swab sample use genomic DNA extraction . Probands time ascertainment initially assume form nonsyndromic deafness . Additional test may perform depend history physical individual deafness gene identify . Data functional study animal model may also point concomitant clinical feature along hearing loss . These additional test may include : photographs videotape subject body face ; eye vision examination suspect known eyesight problem relate genetic hearing loss mutation , EKGs and/or Echocardiograms suspect known heart problem relate genetic hearing loss mutation . Urine blood analysis may request individual genetic nephritic issue infertility . For example , deaf female individual family subsequently discover Perrault syndrome , recessive disorder characterize hearing loss ( usually initial manifestation ) ovarian dysgenesis/primary amenorrhea , additional evaluation would conduct definitive diagnosis Perrault syndrome . Such evaluation would include pelvic ultrasound scan measurement serum estrogen gonadotropin . Similarly , family , hear impaired male may ask fertility since possibility male infertility family segregate Perrault syndrome remain open question . For genetic analysis , genomic DNA extract blood sample buccal swab affect unaffected member family segregate hereditary hearing loss genetically screen polymorphic marker ( STRs SNPs ) linkage know deafness locus . The hearing phenotype child ( &gt; 2 year old ) , adolescent adult subject assign basis performance audiological examination . Genomic DNA family deafness find unlinked known deafness locus use genome wide screen ~ 950,000 SNP marker distribute across entire human genome identify novel deafness locus . Alternatively , DNA sample affect unaffected individual undergo whole exome sequencing ( WES ) whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) focus potentially pathogenic variant locate chromosomal region marker genetically link deafness . Subsequently , novel deafness gene positionally identify function study . Outcome measure : Novel deafness locus gene associate hearing loss identify provide new insight mechanism require sound transduction human [ 1 ] . Data study likely basis commercially available test early diagnosis timely genetic counseling risk couple well development strategy preserve hear prevent hearing loss .</detailed_description>
