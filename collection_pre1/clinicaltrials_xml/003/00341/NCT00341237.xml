	<brief_summary>This study conduct NIEHS University North Carolina Medical Center create maintain biorespository contain genetic material ( DNA ) 20,000 individual recruit North Carolina . These sample allow scientist look difference individual DNA . These difference know associated condition disease date , purpose study test difference possible susceptibility ( protection ) common condition asthma , cardiovascular disease , cancer many others . Many difference study environmental response gene . These gene determine various way human respond toxic substance environment , diet lifestyle ( e.g . exercise vs. exercise ) , exposures substance , e.g . therapeutic . Participants recruit general NC population health fair , study drive community venue corporation , patient clinic within University North Carolina health care system . Participants also visit one two location Research Triangle area volunteer study . All participant ask provide blood sample basic information gender , race ethnicity , compensate time receive $ 20 . DNA extract blood , encrypt secret identification number , place registry 's biorepository . The registry exist 25 year . During time , DNAs available researcher look difference DNAs describe . Participants certain difference might ask participate future study people DNA difference . The future study likely involve fill questionnaire participate telephone survey , may involve interview physical examination laboratory evaluation , include blood test . Participants ask update contact information year 25 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Environmental Polymorphisms Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We establish registry-based cohort repository biological ( e.g . blood , urine , saliva , etc . ) environmental ( e.g . household dust ) specimens ( approximately 20,000 participant ) donate specimen link donor identity , contact information , basic demographic personal identification number ( PIN ) . Specimens available investigator cod form anonymously screen presence single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) mutation DNA , use standard genotyping method well whole genome sequencing ( WGS ) whole exome sequencing ( WES ) , difference hormone , dietary factor , and/or chemical toxin blood urine . Once participant genotypes interest identify , investigator apply re-identification specimen ask participant participate follow-up phenotyping study process know phenotype-by-genotype . Participants may also select participate follow-up study base upon difference biological ( e.g . urine , saliva , etc . ) environmental ( e.g . household dust ) specimens , exposure disease state interest assessment family history disease , occupational , socioeconomic status , lifestyle data collect various health exposure survey . As survey implement , data survey use identify participant participation follow-up study base upon genotype , exposure , disease state . To investigate feasibility establish cohort , name Environmental Polymorphisms Registry ( EPR ) , conduct pilot study ( Environmental Polymorphisms Study EPS ) two University North Carolina ( UNC ) Healthcare clinic , ( February-August 2001 ) . The EPS assess willingness outpatient participate genetic study sort identify potential problem might arise enrol much large 20,000- participant registry ( EPR ) . Recruitment rate high , 77 % patient approach enrol registry . Based result , decide proceed recruitment EPR . EPS participant specimens incorporated large EPR EPS EPR protocols merge one protocol . EPR participant recruit enrolled NIEHS Clinical Research Unit ( CRU ) , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Clinical Center , various healthcare clinic , general public . The latter include university campus , health fair , study drive hold various location ( e.g. , corporation , community center , community event , etc . ) EPR website . Participants ask donate blood DNA isolation archive . Participants may also ask donate biological environmental specimen researcher investigate whether significant change genetic material , hormone , dietary factor , and/or chemical toxin blood urine . Consent administer participant tell specimen use genetic biochemical screening project , contact annually update contact information , may recontacted participate voluntary follow-up study donate additional specimen . EPR participant may also give opportunity complete EPR Health Exposure Survey , order collect health , family history disease , environmental exposure , socioeconomic status , lifestyledata . Information collect survey use well characterize EPR population , make useful answer research question relate gene environment interaction . Participants may contact participate follow-up study base upon data collect survey .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Adults ( great equal 18 year age ) minor ( age 817 year old ) eligible enroll Environmental Polymorphisms Registry . Participants must able understand provide write informed consent ( adult participant parent/ guardian minor ) assent ( minor ) participate . There inclusion exclusion criterion .</criteria>
