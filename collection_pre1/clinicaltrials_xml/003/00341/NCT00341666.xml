	<brief_summary>This study , conduct NIH University Bamako Mali , Africa , study effect concurrent infection malaria filariasis patient ' immune response . Lymphatic filariasis cause infection small parasitic worm call Wuchereria bancrofti acquire mosquito . The worm may cause illness many infect , , cause swell arm , leg , breast genitalia , may progress permanent swell referred elephantiasis . Malaria cause Plasmodium falciparum , another parasite spread mosquito . It cause fever , headache , body ache weakness , , untreated , cause severe illness death . The 8-month study analyze measure immune function blood cell people without filarial infection become infected malaria . The goal study see filarial worm infection affect immunity malaria . Results analysis immune function person malaria without filaria infection compare harbor filaria malaria infection also result healthy control subject . Healthy individual patient malaria filarial infection 1 8 year age 18 65 year age live N'Tessoni healthy individual live Bamako , Mali ( control ) , may eligible study . Participants blood sample collect follow study : - A blood sample collect begin study . Individuals find filarial worm infection second sample drawn nighttime filarial worm present blood . Treatment filaria infection offer infected individual end study . - A second sample collect malaria season . Subjects interview health malaria season re-tested filarial malaria infection finger-prick test . Those test positive malaria offer treatment begin immediately collection donate blood sample.. - A third sample collect end malaria season . Subjects interview health re-tested filarial malaria infection finger prick test . Those positive result either infection offer treatment collec ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response Regulation People Infected Concurrently With Malarial Filarial Parasites</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Residents malaria-endemic region frequently expose variety parasites concurrently malarial parasite . In Mali , lymphatic filariasis co-exists several region highly endemic malaria . Because chronicity filarial infection associate bias towards development adaptive immune response dominate Th2 cytokine , pre-existing filarial infection potential alter immune response towards incoming malarial parasite , clearance consider dependent robust Th1 response . Conversely , immune response filarial parasite may modulate presence malarial parasite . The goal study determine effect concurrent infection malarial filarial parasite innate adaptive immune response homologous heterologous antigen . We characterize response peripheral blood mononuclear cell antigens derive filarial ( Wuchereria bancrofti ) malarial ( Plasmodium falciparum ) parasites group individual without filarial infection follow malaria transmission season , repeatedly expose malarial parasite , determine co-infection filarial parasite affect cellular humoral response malarial filarial antigen . These study may provide basis modify treatment strategy mass treatment malaria region co-endemic lymphatic filariasis .</detailed_description>
