	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Argentina Hospital Espa ol de la Plata Hospital Franc de Buenos Aires , collaboration NHLBI , investigate possible genetic factor lead in-stent restenosis . A stent wire mesh tube surgically place open block artery . The stent stay artery permanently , hold open improve blood flow . In case block coronary artery , stent improves blood flow heart muscle , relieve symptom chest pain shortness breath . Sometimes re-growth tissue within stent , call in-stent restenosis , lead narrow artery , decrease blood flow , recurrence symptom . Genetic analysis may allow identification patient may increase risk in-stent restenosis lead method prevention treatment . Patients 18 year age old undergoing coronary endarterectomy ( surgery remove plaque artery ) treat in-stent restenosis Hospital Espa ol de la Plata Hospital Franc de Buenos Aires may eligible study . Participants blood sample drawn undergo coronary endarterectomy . Tissue remove patient 's artery stent surgery analyze gene expression profile genotyping . The result study along information patient ' medical history .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our laboratory investigate genetic basis vascular disease , in-stent restenosis . We hypothesize patient in-stent restenosis abnormal expression cell cycle regulatory inflammatory gene lead accelerate development vascular lesion follow angioplasty , genetic component underlie individual difference vascular injury . We conduct investigation human subject in-stent restenosis , entitle CardioGene Study . The objective CardioGene study identify genetic profile patient risk in-stent restenosis . The CardioGene study complete enrollment 465 patient December 2004 . Analysis blood gene expression profile , proteomic genotyping data currently ongoing . All analysis conduct use peripheral blood . Concurrent analysis restenosis tissue sample would valuable define molecular genetics disease . In complementary study endartectomy tissue , collect diseased restenosis tissue remove patient part routine clinical care . We also collect blood time tissue harvest genomic analysis , addition clinical data . Genomic data compare CardioGene study finding , purpose validation well detailed understand biology restenosis , investigation molecular mechanism restenosis tissue sample .</detailed_description>
