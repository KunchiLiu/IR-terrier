	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Hematologic Response Rate ( Rate Which Hemoglobin Level Rises ) PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Given Dose 80,000 Units Once Weekly Cancer Patients With Anemia Who Are Receiving Chemotherapy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When compare propose study dose current literature , initial study dose 80,000 Units administer per week equivalent individual dose 1142 Units/kg body weight 70 kg patient . It also common clinical practice anemic cancer patient treat dose PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 40,000 Units weekly . This study open-label , non-randomized pilot study cancer patient non-myeloid malignancy hemoglobin &lt; = 11 g/dL plan receive least 12 week chemotherapy . The objective study evaluate hematologic response , safety , clinical outcome PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 80,000 Units give subcutaneously ( skin ) weekly anemic cancer patient receive chemotherapy . If , time hemoglobin &gt; 13 g/dL , PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) therapy hold hemoglobin &lt; = 12 g/dL , resume 60,000 Units weekly . The dose also reduce hemoglobin rise &gt; 1.3 g/dL 2 week period . Additionally , incidence anti-erythropoietin antibody baseline end study/early withdrawal study patient receive minimum two dos PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) least one-month period evaluate . Rarely , antibody erythropoietin may form patient types disease ( e.g. , autoimmune disease , rheumatoid arthritis , anemia chronic disease ) response exposure erythropoietin product Epoetin alfa necessitate discontinuation erythropoietin agent medical treatment may include blood transfusion . Hemoglobin level , vital sign ( blood pressure ) occurrence severity adverse event assess throughout study . PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) give dose 80,000 Units subcutaneously ( skin ) 12 week . The PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) dose monitor throughout study dose withheld reduce necessary maintain hemoglobin level rate hemoglobin rise .</detailed_description>
