	<brief_summary>The nuclear power plant accident Chornobyl release large quantity Iodine-131 radioisotope iodine atmosphere , contaminate thousand square kilometer expose million people . For study , well-defined subset Ukrainian child age 0-18 year utero time accident identify examine well-trained specialist thyroid disease every two year least three cycle . The study collaborative effort research Ukraine United States . The cohort include approximately 13,000 person child 1986 , thyroid measure radioactivity week immediately follow accident ( whose mother measurements take child utero ) . Under rigid research protocol subject receive diagnostic thyroid examination , include palpation , ultrasound scanning , thyroid hormone laboratory test , , indicate , fine-needle aspiration biopsy . Interview information regard residential , health , diet lifestyle history also collect . All subject follow thyroid cancer morbidity mortality . Thyroid cancer confirm expert pathology examination tissue . In addition analysis thyroid radiation measurement make May-June , 1986 , effort make reconstruct person 's exposure estimate radiation dose thyroid . This involve reconstruction deposition pattern environmental pathway radioiodines , location , dietary characteristic , lifestyle person throughout exposure period . The aim study carry valid credible assessment early late morphologic functional change thyroid gland person expose radiation radioactive material release consequence Chornobyl nuclear power plant accident . The emphasis dose- time-specific change . In course study possible risk factor examine include dietary iodine intake 1986 , ingestion potassium iodide thyroid protection shortly accident .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The nuclear power plant accident Chornobyl release large quantity Iodine-131 radioisotope iodine atmosphere , contaminate thousand square kilometer expose million people . For study , well-defined subset Ukrainian child age less 18 year utero time accident identify follow . The main cohort screen thyroid disease every two year 4 cycle 1998 2007 , another cycle resume 2011 ( fifth cycle ) , underway . The utero cohort screen 2003-2006 also screen since 2011 . The study collaborative effort researcher Ukraine United States . The main cohort include approximately 13,000 person child 1986 , thyroid measure radioactivity week immediately follow accident . Under rigid research protocol , subject receive diagnostic thyroid examination , include palpation , ultrasound scanning , thyroid hormone laboratory test ( first four cycle ) . If indicate , refer fine-needle aspiration biopsy . Interview information regard residential , health , diet lifestyle history also collect . All subject follow thyroid cancer morbidity . Thyroid cancer confirm expert pathology examination tissue obtain surgery . The utero cohort include total 2,582 individual . In addition starting 2003 , ~ 7,000 parent member main cohort age 10 time accident interview order increase accuracy recall . These individual list new subject . Altogether , 23,143 individual accrue study . In addition analysis thyroid radiation measurement make May-June , 1986 , radiation dose thyroid estimate draw data reconstruction deposition pattern environmental pathway radioiodines , location , dietary characteristic , lifestyle person throughout exposure period . For utero subject , fetal dose estimate base mother thyroid dose . The aim study assess early late morphologic functional change thyroid gland person expose young age radiation radioactive material release consequence Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident , emphasis dose-and time-specific change . There several amendment protocol : transition 2008 cancer case ascertainment use passive form follow-up base linkage National Cancer Registry Ukraine ( NCRU ) still continue thefifth cycle screening ; sub-study involve additional follow-up examination cohort member diagnose benign nodular thyroid pathology one early four active screening cycle ; genetic study ( gene expression germline SNP study ) thyroid cancer Ukrainian cohort expose radioiodines Chernobyl fallout child adolescent ; recently , pilot study genomic characterization thyroid cancer ( 2013 ) .</detailed_description>
