	<brief_summary>An NCI goal identify every human gene predisposes people cancer . Recent study HIV-1 indicate genetic polymorphism affect susceptibility viral infection allele may racially restrict , range racial ethnic group include study . We propose examine genetic determinant infection hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) ethnically diverse population injection drug user ( IDUs ) . HBV HCV important cause hepatocellular carcinoma , little known genetic factor alter susceptibility infection . Subjects recruit diverse inner-city neighborhood part University California , San Francisco 's Urban Health Study . Since 1986 , study successfully recruit evaluated IDUs street-based setting . About half participant African-American , one-third white , 10 % Latino , remainder Asian Native American . The mean duration drug use exceed 20 year . About 80 % subject evidence HBV infection similar prevalence HCV infection anticipate . We enroll 1500 subject 13 month period . Archived , unlinked serum specimen may obtain previous enrollee increase sample size , need . Highly exposed-uninfected subject ascertain basis serologic test virus , well duration frequency injection drug use . These highly exposed-uninfected subject compare infected subject regard frequency genetic polymorphism ( chemokines , chemokine receptor , human leukocyte antigen , others ) , collaboration scientist NCI 's Laboratory Genomic Diversity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An NCI goal identify every human gene predisposes people cancer . Recent study HIV -1 indicate genetic polymorphism affect susceptibility viral infection allele may detect study small number highly exposed-uninfected subject . Because allele may racially restrict , range racial ethnic group include study . We propose examine genetic determinant infection hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) ethnically diverse population injection drug user ( lDUs ) . HBV HCV important cause hepatocellular carcinoma , little known genetic factor alter susceptibility infection . Subjects recruit diverse inner-city neighborhood part University California , San Francisco 's Urban Health Study . Since 1986 , study successfully recruit evaluated IDUs street-based setting . About half participant African-American , one-third white , 10 % Latino , remainder Asian Native American . The mean duration drug use exceed 20 year .
