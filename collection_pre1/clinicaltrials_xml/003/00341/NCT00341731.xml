We propose conduct twin study investigate possibility environmental factor important development PCOS phenotype . Twin study consider gold standard determine extent heritability trait . The proposal describe Step 1 large , multi-step study . The major goal step 1 identify large cohort twin pair , least one member pair likely PCOS . Participants study come Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry ( MATR ) . Many ( 3283 ) potential participant already identify base answer preliminary MATR screening questionnaire . Out approximately 7145 twin woman reproductive age complete MATR screen questionnaire , 1803 woman report irregular period , 954 report ovarian cyst , 526 report irregular period ovarian cyst . Many woman last group likely PCOS . They represent 7.4 % total sample , match current estimate PCOS prevalence ( 4-7 % ) reproductive age woman . We also add new twin pair meet criterion ( irregular period evidence PCOS cystic ovary ) recruit MATR take preliminary survey . According MATR statistic , 33 % twin pair monozygotic ( MZ , identical ) . Therefore , approximately 174 526 woman likely PCOS member MZ pair . Step 1 propose study consist telephone survey 3282 woman irregular period and/or ovarian cyst . The survey conduct MATR . The instrument use contains series simple direct question take 10 minute complete .
