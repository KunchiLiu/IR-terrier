	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Johns Hopkins University School Public Health Baltimore , Maryland , determine accurately injection drug user report needle-sharing behavior . Needle-sharing major cause blood-borne disease , include HIV hepatitis . Therefore , good understand behavior critical devising strategy reduce disease spread way . Research needle-sharing behavior rely heavily user ' self-reports . This study compare self-reports result DNA test show whether needle use one individual . Injection drug user 18 year age old participate Baltimore Needle Exchange Program ( BNEP ) recruit study . Syringes distribute user BNEP collect use test differentiate single versus multiple user . The finding compare participant ' response whether share needle syrinx . Participants visit clinic every 6 month interview , include question mental physical health , drug use , sexual activity knowledge HIV ( virus cause AIDS ) AIDS . After interview , small amount blood drawn test HIV , hepatitis , syphilis infectious disease . Some blood store future test . Participants return clinic 4 week interview blood draw get test result . At time , offer referral drug treatment , free condom , advice drug use safer sex opportunity ask question health . Participation study may continue 5 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Self-Reported Needle Sharing Among Injection Drug Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Needle share major cause blood-borne disease make understand needle share behavior imperative devising strategy reduce disease burden . A DNA-based method , use highly informative genetic marker short tandem repeat ( STRs ) propose gold standard measure identify single-use multi-use syrinx . Self-reports needle sharing , main source share information research , compare genotypic result validate response risk behavior . Genotypic information four autosomal STRs use differentiate DNA single versus multiple individual syringe exudate obtain injection drug user ( IDUs ) Baltimore needle exchange program ( BNEP ) study ALIVE II . Detecting three distinct allele autosomal STR syringe exudate provide evidence syringe share least two individual . Matching probability use match genotypic profile individual ( ) check return syringe allele ( ) observe syringe exudate , mixture discrimination probability use measure likelihood single vs. multi genome syringe sample . Behavioral surveillance document rapid spread infectious disease needle sharing among high-risk sub-population IDUs critical global public health along development implementation timely intervention .</detailed_description>
