	<brief_summary>Ionizing radiation efficiently induce chromosomal aberration ( CA ) several study CA conduct among small group flight crew . However , study evaluate unstable aberration reflect recent exposure , long-term cumulative cosmic radiation exposure . Chromosome paint fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) widely use establish cytogenetic method detect stable aberration translocation . Thus , FISH use estimate chromosomal damage cumulative radiation exposure . No large study flight crew utilize FISH conduct date . We propose study measure CA use FISH group pilot estimate high comic radiation exposure base flight history , i.e. , long duration fly international route , comparison group university faculty minimal fly history . These measurement use determine pilot elevate frequency CA ( specifically stable translocation ) compare university faculty . In addition , frequency CA examine relation cumulative cosmic radiation dose determine dose-response relationship . Individual cumulative dos calculate pilot flight history use computer program develop FAA estimate cosmic radiation accounting change altitude latitude , 11-year solar cycle time flight . We collect information age , lifestyle factor , diet , health history , family cancer history , medical radiation exposure personal interview self-administered dietary questionaire . These factor may affect CA frequency plan adjust statistical analysis . Pilots identify base Allied Pilots Association roster faculty commercial company maintain database university faculty , include Chicago area . Potential participant notify study mail recruited/screened eligibility telephone . We compensate participant $ 100 time . A field station set medical health clinic convenient participant , interview Will conduct peripheral blood sample collect . Participants notify overall study result may request personal CA result end study . Participants may also choose additional blood drawn , however blood sample anonymized link back participant . Genotypic variant DNA repair ( possibly ) gene evaluate effect CA frequency .</brief_summary>
