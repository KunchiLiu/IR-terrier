	<brief_summary>Chordoma uncommon ( 400 case/year U.S. ) potentially fatal bone tumor derive remnant embryonic notochord . It occur primarily axial skeleton mean age diagnosis 55 year , range early childhood 70 year . This tumor usually present advanced stage associate mortality high due local destruction distant metastasis . Chordoma rare African-Americans typically sporadic ; report tumor arise congenitally within member family . Recently , identify study one large family 10 relative three generation chordoma ; inheritance pattern suggest transmission mutation autosomal dominant gene . Using information family , tentatively nap gene long arm chromosome 7 . To confirm finding , fine map clone gene , need study additional chordoma family . In effort identify family , develop collaboration four SEER registry cover population Detroit , Los Angeles , Iowa , New Mexico . Each registry identify chordoma case diagnose since 1988 invite ( next kin decease case ) participate study . Through 1997 , registry identify total 140 chordoma case , 96 living . The registry invite patient ( next kin ) participate study . The study component include completion self-administered personal family medical history questionnaire , retrieval medical record pathology report pertain chordoma , collection paraffin-embedded chordoma tissue buccal mucosal cell genetic study . NCI carry data collection activity study subject identify Detroit registry . NCI also conduct buccal cell collection component study patient identify three registry . These three registry carry study activity patients/next kin send data slide prepare paraffin block NCI . NCI analyze questionnaire data determine unusual pattern cancer chordoma medical condition appear cluster family chordoma patient .
