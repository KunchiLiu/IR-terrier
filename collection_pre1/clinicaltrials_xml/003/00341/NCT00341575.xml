	<brief_summary>This study , conduct NHGRI M.D . Anderson Cancer Center Houston , Texas , develop statistical approach model family social structure apply model explore role family social structure participation genetic test counseling , disclosure test result adjustment risk status . With recent genetic advance ability test hereditary illness , method provide understand family social structure structure affect dissemination genetic risk information increasingly important . The data study collect M.D . Anderson Cancer Center part study family communication family function regard genetic test hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer ( HNPCC ) . Relatives people HNPCC likely general population get colon cancer type cancer inherit gene alteration ( mutation ) predispose disease . This alteration pass parent child . In M.D . Anderson Cancer Center study , telephone interview conduct 80 adult member 16 extended family know gene alteration predispose HNPCC . These participant include people diagnose HNPCC syndrome cancer , unaffected family member risk carry gene mutation HNPCC , spouses . Participants interview feeling , mood , cop style , relationship spouse , relative , friend , willingness genetic testing , feeling beliefs colon cancer , cancer screen genetic test counseling .
