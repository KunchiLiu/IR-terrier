	<brief_summary>The important risk factor asthma inner-city home may exposure cockroach allergen . In previous study , researcher report extermination alone , without resident education professional cleaning , reduce allergen level inner-city home . This result contradict early finding scientist . This study seek confirm researcher ' early result , determine intensive effective extermination must . The study last one year include 60 infested , multi-unit rental home North Carolina , divide three group . In Treatment-1 group , researcher North Carolina State University set insecticide bait initial follow-up visit , high standard treatment . In Treatment-2 group , one five commercial pest-control company randomly assign treat home accord 12-month , pre-paid contract . The third group control group receive extermination treatment . In home , researcher periodically survey resident , monitor cockroach number , monitor allergen level dust sample . If study successful , use plan future asthma prevention trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cockroach Allergen Reduction Extermination Alone Low-Income , Urban Homes : A Randomized Control Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence suggest exposure cockroach allergen might important risk factor asthma inner-city household . Contrary student literature , recently report cockroach extermination alone-without professional cleaning occupant education-reduced cockroach allergen level inner-city home . This important finding extermination alone would much less expensive easy implement comprehensive intervention . The primary objective study validate previous find cockroach extermination alone significantly reduce cockroach allergen level inner-city home . The secondary objective determine level expertise effort extermination would require achieve significant allergen reduction . The study design 3-arm , randomize control trial . Sixty cockroach-infested , multi-unit rental home randomly assign either control group one two treatment group . The Treatment-1 group , test efficacy extermination , receive insecticide bait placement staff Urban Entomology Department North Carolina State University ( gold standard study ) . The Treatment-2 group , test effectiveness extermination , receive extermination 1 5 commercial pest control company randomly assign home . Study staff assist home occupant obtain 12-month , prepaid contract . Periodically home , study staff administer questionnaire , set cockroach trap monitor cockroach number , sample dust monitor cockroach allergen level . Treatment-1 home receive extermination NCSU staff baseline need , determine cockroach trap count . Treatment-2 home receive extermination commercial applicator accord term contract . In NIEHS laboratory Dr. Zeldin , dust sample analyze concentration cockroach allergen Bla g 1 Bla g 2 . Statistical analysis compare cockroach allergen concentration change treatment group relative change control group . The percentage home concentration reduce 8.0 2.0 unit allergen per gram dust-the propose threshold asthma morbidity allergic sensitization , respectively-will also compare group . The result study , prove consistent previous work , use NIEHS plan future primary secondary asthma prevention trial . With exception NCSU staff , field laboratory work carry staff Dr. Zeldin 's clinical program .</detailed_description>
