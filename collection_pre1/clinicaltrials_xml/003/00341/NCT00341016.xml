	<detailed_description>Leukemia hold special place study radiation-related cancer bone marrow one tissue sensitive carcinogenic effect ionize radiation . Radiogenic leukemia short latent period among radiation-induced cancer , appearance suggest solid tumor may follow . These characteristic also contribute considerable significance radiation protection . There , nevertheless , important gap exist knowledge radiation-induced leukemia , gap derive characteristic study atomic bombing Hiroshima Nagasaki , study effect medical irradiation study nuclear worker ; study provide information date . The gap include presume reduction risk result dose-fractionation low dose-rate , well time- response function first five year exposure . The study describe herein intend fill gap . The Chornobyl accident expose hundred thousand people radiation , notably involved cleanup operation . The second phase case-control study ionize radiation leukemia conduct cohort approximately 100,000 Ukrainian `` liquidator '' involve cleanup work follow accident Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant northern Ukraine occur April 26 , 1986 . The cohort restrict liquidator first work around power plant 1986 1990 resident , first register Chornobyl State Registry , Kyiv City one five oblasts ( major civil division ) comprise study area . This cohort , consist male work age , receive mean bone marrow dose approximately 80-100 milli-gray ( mGy ) low moderate dose rate , send earlier receive high dos . The primary objective study investigate leukemia risk function radiation ; constitute probably large epidemiologic study conduct date among working-age male , group particular concern establish occupational radiation safety standard . The primary scientific objective propose study evaluate whether doserelated increase risk leukemia among liquidator , compare observe risk per unit dose see atomic bomb survivor , expose essentially instantaneous radiation . A secondary objective identify modifier risk , include time since exposure , age exposure , etc . The field work second phase study , extend case ascertainment 2001 2006 complated . As result second phase , total of75 confirm case leukemia 12 case multiple myeloma ascertain . We currently process database construction , dosimetric calculation data analysis leukemia , manuscript preparation . The small sub-study uncertainty associate human factor start upon SSIRB approval .</detailed_description>
