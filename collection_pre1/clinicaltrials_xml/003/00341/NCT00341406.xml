	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Stanford University Palo Alto , California , examine insulin metabolism cardiovascular risk alter response weight loss . Insulin natural hormone cause cell remove glucose ( sugar ) blood . People insulin-sensitive remove glucose efficiently . People insulin-resistant require insulin remove glucose blood . Adult volunteer recruit study advertisement local newspaper community around Stanford University . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Insulin sensitivity testing : Before begin study , participant test insulin sensitivity . For test , two small catheter ( plastic tube ) place two vein - one infusing glucose , insulin , sandostatin ( drug block insulin secretion pancreas ) , one draw blood sample . The infusion do 3 hour . Blood sample collect , , end study measure well cell remove glucose blood response insulin . - Research diet : Participants assign low-calorie diet tailor individual 's metabolic rate . The diet contain either 40 60 percent total calorie carbohydrate , 40 20 percent fat , rest protein . People type 2 diabetes take diabetes medicine diet 45 50 percent carbohydrate , 35 40 percent fat , rest protein . - Meal profile : Before begin diet 4 month diet , participant test effect various study diet control blood sugar fat . On day test , participant physical examination provide medical history . Then , small catheter place vein . Blood sample draw breakfast hourly 8 hour . - Participants diabetic randomly assign take one three diabetes medication - rosiglitazone , glucophage , sulfonylurea compound - help control blood glucose level . - Magnetic resonance imaging : This diagnostic test use strong magnetic field radio wave show structural chemical change tissue . During scan , participant lie table narrow cylinder contain magnetic field , wear ear plug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . He speak staff member via intercom system time procedure . In addition procedure , patient may ask fat cell biopsy . This do determine whether insulin-resistant people few fat cell fat per cell insulin-sensitive people . For test , small piece fat tissue surgically remove , local anesthetic , area low abdomen . With participant 's consent , genetic testing may do fat tissue sample look gene may link central obesity insulin resistance . Some participant may ask follow additional 3 month completion study continue weight loss program . The follow-up include weekly visit weight measurement review food record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Little know turnover adipose cell fat depot normal animal human subject . However , microarray analysis adipose cell gene expression high risk insulin-resistant human subject suggest reduced rate adipose cell turnover associate enhance adipose cell size systemic insulin resistance . New technology permit detailed analysis adipose cell size include detection small cell may process active differentiation . We propose examine relationship adipose cell size distribution systemic insulin resistance obese human subject . Adipose tissue biopsy obtain Stanford University protocols consent form approve Stanford University IRB . Only procedures already perform subject protocol use .</detailed_description>
