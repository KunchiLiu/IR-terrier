	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetic ( non-insulin-dependent ) five time likely suffer initial myocardial infarction ( MI ; heart attack ) compare nondiabetics.Female diabetic particular , high mortality rate coronary artery disease ( CAD ) male diabetics.C-reactive protein measurement clinical setting enhances detection individual high risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , provide additional predictive value . We propose study effect supervise exercise diet intervention cardiovascular disease risk postmenopausal diabetic woman . We recruit 35 postmenopausal , sedentary type 2 diabetic undergo 3 month exercise dietary intervention . They exercise 3 time week 30 min supervise set . Exercise mode aerobic self-selected ( i.e . treadmill , bike ) intensity level 50-85 % VO2peak . Blood glucose monitor exercise . The dietary intervention consist 6 meeting register dietitian . The study design test follow hypothesis : - Cardiovascular disease risk measure different follow 3-month exercise diet intervention . - H1 : Blood marker coronary artery disease risk , measure CRP , TC , LDL , TG , FG , fast insulin , HbA1c , different follow 3-month exercise diet intervention . - H2 : Anthropometric measure coronary artery disease risk , measure WHR , different follow 3-month exercise diet intervention . - H3 : Resting blood pressure , measure SBP DBP , different follow 3-month exercise diet intervention . - H4 : Total body fat , measure DXA , different follow 3-month exercise diet intervention . - Health-related measure different follow 3-month exercise diet intervention . - H1 : Cardiorespiratory fitness , measure maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) different follow 3-month exercise diet intervention . - H2 : Bone-mineral density , measure DXA , different follow 3-month exercise diet intervention . - H3 : Dietary measure ( total daily kcal , daily fat kcal ) different follow 3-month exercise diet intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Recruitment : Participants sign research recruitment mail list UCSF/Mt . Zion Osteoporosis Center mail CHR approve recruitment letter briefly describe study purpose eligibility criterion . Only individual 's name address mail list ; medical information . Medical record access . Telephone screen take place ESS Department USF . A script follow . - Pre Post-Testing : Interested subject candidate schedule meet Dr. Orri Dr. Thompson USF provide write informed consent complete health history questionnaire ( see appendix ) evaluate CV risk . They obtain write medical notification physician state adequate diabetic control clear begin exercise program . Once select , measurement HT , WT , WHR , SBP , DBP take place ESS lab USF . - Blood draw : Subjects arrive UCSF GCRC 12-hr fast . The blood variable obtain include : CRP , TC , LDL-C , HDL-C , TG , FG , fast insulin ( HOMA calculate marker insulin resistance ) , HbA1c . Approximately 2 tablespoon blood drawn . - Bone mineral density : BMD measurement ( dual X-ray absorptiometry , DXA ) take place General Clinical Research Center UCSF follow blood draw . A snack provide subject prior enter DXA scan area . - Cardiorespiratory fitness : Maximal exercise test use treadmill protocol Exercise Physiology Laboratory UCSF General Clinical Research Center . Tests conduct Dr. Orri , Dr. Thompson , Joanne Krasnoff , M.S . The Naughton protocol use grade increase 3.5 % every 2 min , speed remain 2 mph warmup . The subject continue volitional exhaustion exercise technician terminate test end designate American College Sports Medicine ( ACSM ) . All participant 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) test session monitor dysrhythmias ischemia . Heart rate blood pressure monitor every 2 minute . Rating perceived exertion ( RPE ) assess every minute test . Maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) , well maximal level blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory exchange ratio ( RER ) , RPE record end test use determine exercise training intensity . Expired gas collect throughout test CO2 O2 volume analyze calculation oxygen uptake use Quinton QMC computerize gas analysis system ( Quinton Instruments , Bothell WA ) . All exercise technician CPR first-aid certified . - Body composition BMD : Per cent body fat ( % BF ) BMD determine use dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) . All scan do GE-Lunar Prodigy ( Madison , WI ) . Variables interest DXA scan % BF , total fat mass , lean body mass ( LBM ) , bone mineral density g/cm2 . - Exercise intervention : The 3-month exercise intervention take place Millberry Union fitness center UCSF , time per week 30 min session , accompany certified fitness professional train work special population . All standard emergency procedure follow trained UCSF staff . - Exercise program design : Study participant require complete 36 exercise session 12 week program . They exercise minimum 3 time per week 30 min , accompany certified fitness professional train work special population . Participants wear HR monitor instruct maintain intensity range 50-85 % VO2peak obtain max testing . During initial phase training ( first 4 week ) , participant unable exercise continuously 30 minute perform intermittent exercise bouts 10 minute follow 5 min rest . Mode exercise self-selected involve large muscle group , incorporate combination follow machine : treadmill , stationary cycle , elliptical , Stairmaster , row ergometer . - Blood glucose monitoring : Participants instruct consume snack 30-60 min exercise . Prior begin exercise session , subject monitor blood glucose verify 100 250 mg/dl , absence hypo/hyperglycemic symptom ( 6 ) . In addition , subject monitor 30 min post-exercise verify BG &gt; 70 mg/dl . Juice protein snack ( peanut butter &amp; cracker ) available subject case post-exercise hypoglycemia . The exercise supervisor aware subject take medication promote insulin production carry glucagon pen . Late-evening exercise session avoid order prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia . - Dietary intervention : The subject receive six 30-min nutrition group counsel session dietitian . Sessions 1 6 involve instruction prepare 3-day dietary log , session 2-5 consist select topic ( i.e . dietary recommendation , low sodium diet , blood glucose control ) .</detailed_description>
