However , association autoimmune disease farm extensively investigate , exposure data currently available study extremely limit . One major challenge conduct population-based research autoimmune diseases case ascertainment . Self-report previous diagnosis show unreliable . This protocol outline strategy confirm self-reported diagnosis systemic autoimmune disease ( rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , scleroderma , Sjogren syndrome ) within Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) cohort . The confirmed case constitute refine case group allow etiologic analysis pesticides farming-related exposure possible risk factor diseases use data already collect . The code also use nest case-control study could design collect additional exposure data ( example , silica-related exposure ) .</detailed_description>
