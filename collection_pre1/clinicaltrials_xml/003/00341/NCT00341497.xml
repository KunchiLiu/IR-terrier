	<brief_summary>The purpose determine extent genetic damage oral mucosal lesion ascertain study , whether specific genotype associate genetic damage observe oral mucosal lesion , whether extent genetic damage change time , factor ( e.g . smoking ) contribute change . Genetic damage indicator include among others DNA adduct formation , particularly related tobacco smoke carcinogens polycyclic aromatic hydocarbons . The genotypes interest focus affect carcinogen metabolism , ( e.g. , ( CYP family ) , may also include related growth factor , cell cycle control , DNA repair . Microsatellite instability another key indicator damage plan examine . This study undertaken due paucity data type oral lesion see general dental practice limit knowledge natural history lesion . Persons enrol red and/or white oral lesion identify 6 Dental Clinics VA Medical Centers . The VA Centers involve : Washington , DC ; Atlanta , GA ; Durham , NC ; San Francisco , CA ; Danville , IL ; San Antonio , TX . When dentist find red white lesion course routine outpatient examination care , obvious cause denture frictional lesion could rule , normal standard care lesion biopsy , patient consider enrollment study . The study describe patient , consent sign , patient receive intraoral examination identify characterize oral lesion , lesion photograph , oral epithelial cell sample take site rest oral mucosa , patient interview use standard questionnaire request information sociodemograhic , medical , lifestyle factor , particularly tobacco alcohol use part study protocol , patient receive biopsy part normal care . The biopsy report obtain small piece biopsy material need patient diagnostic purpose . The subject return every 4-6 month reassessment lesion determine lesion return . The patient complete questionnaire visit lifestyle factor tobacco alcohol use could reassess . Also oral epithelial cell scraping obtain visit . This study particularly valuable longitudinal data collect data collect time use standard procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Biomarkers Oral Cancer study undertaken well understand role genetic lifestyle factor natural history oral premalignant lesion . The purpose study determine extent genetic damage oral mucosal lesion ascertain study , whether specific genotype associate genetic damage observe oral mucosal lesion , whether extent genetic damage change time , factor ( e.g . smoking ) contribute change . This study particularly valuable longitudinal data collect time use standardized procedure . Persons enrol study red and/or white oral lesion identify 6 Dental Clinics VA Medical Centers . When dentist find red white lesion course routine outpatient examination care , obvious cause denture frictional lesion could rule , normal standard care lesion biopsy , patient consider enrollment study . The study describe patient , consent form sign , patient receive intraoral examination identify characterize oral lesion , lesion photograph , oral epithelial cell sample take site rest oral mucosa , patient interview use standard questionnaire request information sociodemographic , medical , lifestyle factor , particularly tobacco alcohol use part study protocol . The patient lesion biopsied part normal care . The biopsy report obtain , small piece biopsy material need patient diagnostic purpose . The subject return every 4-6 month reassessment lesion determine lesion return . The patient complete questionnaire visit lifestyle factor tobacco alcohol use could reassess . Also , oral epithelial cell scraping obtain visit .
