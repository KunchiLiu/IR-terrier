	<brief_summary>This case-control study plan investigate link solar radiation gene damage , host factor , DNA repair proficiency cutaneous malignant melanoma ( CMM ) risk . The hypothesis impair DNA repair proficiency associate increase risk CMM due unrepaired DNA damage , particularly subject dysplastic nevus , poor tan ability genetic susceptibility . The study review RO1 Grant National Cancer Institute 1995 . Subject enrollment , include clinical evaluation , epidemiologic questionnaire , skin blood sample collection , complete 1999 approximately 180 melanoma case 180 control identify Italy . The study protocol consent form include measurement genetic biochemical factor DNA repair capacity . DNA repair proficiency measure lymphocytes host cell reactivation assay , sun exposure evaluate mean detailed questionaire . Photographs back subject take allow nevus count . Minimal erythemal dosage measure subject estimate skin sun sensitivity 24 hour skin 's UV-irradiation . Skin color ascertain inner side forearm mean Minolta chromometer . The aim protocol continue analysis biological sample already collect , originally outline study protocol . In particular , plan measure polymorphisms gene may lead susceptibility melanoma . Initially concentrate variation gene involve repair damage DNA , plan look broad group candidate susceptibility gene .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The original case-control study plan investigate link solar radiation gene damage , host factor , include also genetic variant , DNA repair proficiency cutaneous malignant melanoma ( CMM ) risk , subject Mediterranean area , characterize wide range pigmentary characteristic intense sun exposure . This study review funded R01 grant National Cancer Institute 1995 . Subject enrollment , include clinical evaluation , epidemiologic questionnaire , skin blood sample collection , complete 1999 approximately 180 melanoma case 180 control identify Italy . The study protocol consent form include measurement genetic biochemical factor , DNA repair capacity . DNA repair proficiency measure lymphocytes host cell reactiviation assay , sun exposure evaluate mean detailed questionnaire . Minimal erythemal dosage measure subject estimate skin sun sensitivity 24 hour skin 's UVirradiation . Skin color ascertain inner side forearm mean minolta chromometer . The aim protocol continue analysis biological sample data already collect , originally outline study protocol . However , original sample size small preclude specific analysis gene-environment interaction crucial understanding etiology melanoma . We identify collaborator willing share data sample u increase power statistical analysis . We obtain approval ( amendments 02-C-N035 approved November 2006 , September 2008 , December 2010 , June 2011 ) use DNA sample data collect four study conduct investigator University L'Aquila , Italy , University Genoa , Italy , Istituto Valenciano de Oncologia , Valencia , Spain , New York University School Medicine , respectively . We obtain approval stipulation August 2014 also include sample data collect Papa Giovanni XXII Hospital Bergamo , Italy University Athens , Greece . We respond stipulation ask include sample University Padua Hospital Clinic Barcelona within study . We currently analyze gene several pathway , include pigmentation , DNA repair , immune-related function involve transition nevus melanoma ( gene cell cycle , telomere , signal pathway , etc ) . With additional sample plan conduct GWAS analysis melanoma Mediterranean country molecular analysis melanoma tissue lesion improve classification disease association melanoma progression .</detailed_description>
