	<brief_summary>In collaborative effort Health Research Board , national organization medical research Republic Ireland , individual neural tube defect ( NTDs ) facial cleft defect parent study . With exception well-described syndrome case NTDs facial cleft inherit Mendelian fashion . Nearly incident case occur family prior history defect . The observed recurrence risk family NTD child 10-12 fold high general population suggest inherited factor modify risk . Historically , incidence NTDs Ireland 5-8 fold high USA . The aim study identify gene ( ) involve defect use standard genetic epidemiology approach , transmission disequilibrium test gene mapping strategy . We initially evaluate gene know involved folate metabolism pattern formation ( development body ) . The major outcome measure aggregate allele frequency case group compare control . Biochemical parameter red cell plasma also measure . Comparisons make presence genetics variant , biochemical parameter clinical phenotype .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Eligible participant child adult NTD parent reside Republic Ireland , Northern Ireland United Kingdom NTDs define include form spina bifida aperta ( meningocele , meningomyelocele ) , encephalocele , anencephaly , rachischisis , iniencephaly lipomeningocele . Hydrocephalus , hydranencephaly , dermal sinus spina bifida occulta qualify NTDs . For oral cleft , eligible participant child adult facial cleft Ireland parent . All family NTDs cleft recruit study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Those know syndrome exclude analyzed separately . Cases biologic parent available exclude component triad ( case , mother father ) analysis , although data NTD case may useful study component .</criteria>
