	<brief_summary>This study try identify gene gene responsible myopia ( nearsightedness ) examine relationship myopia near work . Myopia common eye disorder world , affect one four Americans . Several study indicate myopia inherit . The condition tend cluster family , study family condition may facilitate find exact cause . Caucasian Americans African Americans myopia general good health may eligible study . People family history myopia several generation along one parent side , one sibling myopia prefer . People severe disease involve myopia , Stickler Marfan syndrome , retinitis pigmentosa diabetic retinopathy may participate . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Eye examination , include refraction - Blood draw genetic study possibly establishment cell line ( collection cell grown laboratory original tissue specimen ) future research - Myopia Family Study Questionnaire personal medical information questionnaire provide information medical condition may influence development myopia ; vision status spouse child , parent sibling , spouse parent siblings - Risk Factor Questionnaire ( Jewish Orthodox community ) ass amount near work activity do childhood</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Myopia nearsightedness , condition result inability see distant object clearly , affect one four Americans common eye disorder world enormous public health economic impact . Depending epidemiologic definition , 3-19 % acquire blindness ascribed myopia . Evidence exist myopia complex disorder significant genetic component well potential environmental influence . Implicating genetic factor , Sorsby et al . find trait correlation monozygotic twin nearly twice dizygotic twin zero control pair . A study , Chen et al. , Chinese twin pair find high concordance rate myopia ( 92.2 % ) monozygotic twin concordant close-work habit , difference le one hour per day spend study reading , compare monozygotic twin discordant close-work habit ( 79.3 % ) . The two study suggest additive interaction zygosity close-work habit . Since tendency myopia cluster family , study family myopia open possibility identify gene ( ) responsible pathogenesis myopia . These gene could provide molecular tool investigation inherit myopia may also provide start point elucidate mechanism influence near work progression myopia . The goal proposal identify region human genome contain gene responsible non-syndromic myopia utilize pedigree identify Myopia Family Study genotype generate Dr. Dwight Stambolian 's laboratory University Pennsylvania well Center Inherited Disease Research . Pedigree collection ongoing several geographic region include Lakewood , NJ , collection Orthodox Jewish family , Lancaster County , PA collection Amish family , Philadelphia , recruitment family African American Chinese American background . Pedigrees Caucasian descent also collect Philadelphia . All data collection direction Dr. Stambolian fund grant NEI ; NHGRI fund use data collection , NHGRI investigator contact study subject . Because disorder complex high likelihood cause multiple locus , multiple parametric non-parametric method analysis employ . Heterogeneity take account analysis , environmental covariates , effect near work , possible .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The subject population adult individual child , good health exception myopia . Subjects choose base upon vision history extend family . Preferred subject family myopia pass several generation along one parent side , one sibling affect myopia , one parent affect . Specific eligibility requirement index case include : 1 . Cycloplegic refraction 1.00 spherical equivalent ( long 1.00D high meridian astigmatism present ) bad eye age 50 consider myopic ; 2 . Manifest refraction 1.00 spherical equivalent ( long 1.00D high meridian astigmatism present ) bad eye age 50 consider myopic ; 3 . No history systemic ocular disease might predispose myopia include premature birth ; 4 . The index case familial history myopia either parent child close relative ( suggest genetic influence ) ; 5 . In event parent index case myopia , prefer one parent affect myopia . Some bilineal family may collect necessary achieve desire sample size , unilateral family prefer . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Excluded University Pennsylvania study severe disease involve myopia , Stickler Marfan syndrome , ocular disease Retinitis Pigmentosa , diseases may secondarily cause myopia diabetes retinopathy prematurity . Records eye examination obtain prior onset systemic ocular disease accept . Individuals complete Risk Factor Questionnaire state bear month prematurely include study . Individuals myopic one eye unaffected ( ulnilateral myope ) include study . Individuals sign Consent Form exclude , family necessary member sign Consent Form exclude . No fetus , pregnant woman , prisoner institutionalize individual enrol . Generally , myopia associate mental impairment , although careful consideration give determine cognitive understanding potentially impaired person appropriate enrollment order assure protection human right optimize .</criteria>
