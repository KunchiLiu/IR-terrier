	<brief_summary>We propose study prevalence thyroid nodule cancer relation radiation dose , define cohort Kazakhstan resident expose child radioactive fallout atomic bomb test neighbor Semipalatinsk Test Site ( STS ) . The population near STS believe receive radiation dose fallout much high experienced population comparable size US . The study population define cohort 20,000 resident , half , 1960 , reside heavily-exposed village ; half live lightly-exposed village . The population rural , diet heavily dependent upon fresh milk household local cow therefore likely lead ingestion radioactive iodine fallout . The study two part . The first part involve cytogenetic assay radiation biodosimetry purpose peripheral lymphocyte obtain blood sample donate 40 cohort member individual radiation dose estimate . Blood sample collect 25 putative high-dose 15 low-dose cohort member process cytogenetic assay use fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) stable chromosome aberration peripheral lymphocyte . This biodosimetric validation assay , carry Nailya Chaizhunusova , chief cytogenetics Scientific research Institute Radiation Medicine Ecology , collaboration Dr. Tracy Yang NASA Johnson Space Center Houston , Texas . It possible detect gamma radiation dose low 150 mGy . The second part involve thyroid screen ultrasound select village . The population screen comprise 100-1500 member study cohort expose young child high fallout level , equal number comparable age expose little fallout .

	<detailed_description>We propose study prevalence thyroid nodule cancer relation radiation dose , define cohort Kazakhstan resident expose child radioactive fallout atomic bomb test neighbor Semipalatinsk Test Site ( STS ) . The population near STS believe receive radiation dose fallout much high experienced population comparable size US .

The population rural , diet heavily dependent upon fresh milk household local cow therefore likely lead ingestion radioactive iodine fallout . The study two part . The first part involve cytogenetic assay radiation biodosimetry purpose peripheral lymphocyte obtain blood sample donate 40 cohort member individual radiation dose estimate , electron paramagnetic resonance ( EPR ) assay 110 stored tooth sample . The two technique complementary . Blood sample collect 25 putative high-dose 15 low-dose cohort member process cytogenetic assay use fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) stable chromosome aberration peripheral lymphocyte . This biodosimetric validation assay , carry Nailya Chaizhunusova , chief cytogenetics Scientific research Institute Radiation Medicine Ecology , collaboration Dr. Tracy Yang NASA Johnson Space Center Houston , Texas . It possible detect gamma radiation dose low 150 mGy . The EPR investigation take advantage repository teeth extract local dentist medical dental program 1966-67 1999 , store , catalogue collaborator Kazakhstan ( connection study ) . Tooth sample identify village exposure , individually within village . However , identity donor , therefore age exposure history , know collaborator Kazakhstan ; therefore possible compare EPR result gamma dose estimate calculate basis exposure history . It intend EPR assay carry National Institute Standards Technology purchase order agreement . The second part involve thyroid screen ultrasound select village . The population screen comprise 1000-1500 member study cohort expose young child high fallout level , equal number comparable age expose little fallout .

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects select accordance research aim project . The majority wholebody bone marrow radiation dose estimate high available among subject child time major fallout event . Few presumably lowexposure subject need null control . All subject bear 1940 1948 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects must medical history include radiation therapy highdose diagnostic radiography treat cancer .</criteria>
