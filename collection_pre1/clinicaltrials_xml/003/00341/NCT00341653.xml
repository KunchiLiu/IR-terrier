	<brief_summary>We propose add collection buccal cell school-based cohort 7th grader Wuhan , large industrial city China . The cohort study conduct Wuhan Public Health Anti-Epidemic Station ( Li Yan MD , director principal investigator ) . The cohort study design look several outcome . One initiation smoking . The second respiratory health relation active passive smoking environmental exposure prevalent Wuhan . The respiratory outcomes include change pulmonary function , asthma respiratory symptom . Collection buccal cell noninvasive method obtain DNA . The addition genetic sample enable u examine candidate gene association asthma childhood respiratory illness within interest well-characterized Chinese population . In addition , provide capability examine gene environment interaction respect common environmental exposure Wuhan . The ability examine gene-environment interaction help identify relatively subtle effect pollutant environmental tobacco smoke become common exposure due major increase smoking among Chinese men . Other exposures interest Wuhan indoor coal burn high ambient exposure particules , ozone nitrogen oxide . The propose study approve human subject committee Wuhan Public Health Anti-Epidemic Station .</brief_summary>
