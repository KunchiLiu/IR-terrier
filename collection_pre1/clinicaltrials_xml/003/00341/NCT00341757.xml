Validated cancer outcome assign ICD-9 code nosology team follow double-blinded protocol . A certainty level assign cancer outcome base type confirm medical record , evidence microscopic confirmation malignancy consider certain . Statistical analysis determine FHCQ1 sensitivity , specificity , predictive value , perform , account level certainty . Predictors cancer report accuracy examine use multivariate regression .</detailed_description>
