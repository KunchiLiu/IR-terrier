	<brief_summary>This study examine genetic basis psoriasis psoriatic arthritis . It known gene play important role determine get psoriasis psoriatic arthritis . This study look specific gene variant ( allele ) run family condition , find often people condition without . Participants study identify dermatology service University Michigan Medical Center , Ann Arbor Veterans Affairs Medical Center , University Kiel , Henry Ford Hospital . Additional family provide National Psoriasis Foundation Tissue Bank . They include people psoriasis psoriatic arthritis , , addition family member patient . Only family age patient disease onset 40 year include . Patients include lesion cover 1 percent total body surface area least two skin , scalp , nail , joint lesion diagnose psoriasis . Healthy volunteer also enrol control subject . Participants undergo follow procedure , follow : Patients psoriasis people without psoriasis multiple family member disease - Skin evaluation - Photographs lesion documentation Patients psoriatic arthritis people without psoriatic arthritis multiple family member disease - Joint evaluation possibly ultrasound - Joint X-rays review exist X-rays Patients psoriasis , psoriatic arthritis , healthy volunteer - Blood draw 30 milliliter . Some blood collect used test rheumatoid factor C-reactive protein patient psoriatic arthritis . - Periodic questionnaire update health status information</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The aim study examine role HLA killer immunoglobulin-like receptor ( KIR ) natural history psoriasis vulgaris . Psoriasis chronic inflammatory disease skin feature autoimmune disease , previous study reveal association certain HLA class I alleles , notably HLA-Cw*0602 . Natural Killer ( NK ) cell unique group lymphocytes involve surveillance kill foreign infected cell mechanism involve recognition HLA class I molecules extremely diverse set receptor NK cell surface . A major group receptor KIRs . Thus , relationship KIR/HLA genotype psoriasis biologically plausible , indeed previous data laboratory show strong association activate gene KIR2DS1 KIR2DS2 development psoriatic arthritis , well-recognized complication psoriasis . Dr. James Elder colleague University Michigan identify cohort 560 family dermatology service University Michigan Medical Center , University Kiel , Henry Ford Hospital , National Psoriasis Foundation Tissue Bank . Individuals well characterize clinically , information race , ethnicity , age onset , current age , history inflammatory bowel disease and/or autoimmune disorder obtain . The large size cohort provide substantial statistical power , major importance KIR/HLA association study .</detailed_description>
