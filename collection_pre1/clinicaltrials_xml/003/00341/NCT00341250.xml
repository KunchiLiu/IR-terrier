	<brief_summary>This study test experimental vaccine call AMA1-C1 child see safe reduces episodes malaria parasitemia ( parasite blood ) child expose malaria . Malaria affect 300 million 500 million people worldwide year , cause 2 million 3 million death , mostly among child le 5 sub-Saharan Africa . It lead cause death illness among general population Mali West Africa . Increasing drug resistance malaria parasite widespread resistance mosquito ( insect transmit parasite ) pesticides reduce ability control malaria strategy . A vaccine could reduce illness death malaria would valuable new resource fight disease . AMA1-C1 experimental vaccine develop NIAID . Tests AMA1-C1 87 healthy people United States Mali find serious harmful side effect vaccine . Two- three-year-old child live Don gu bougou Bancoumana , Mali , general good health may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Participants randomly assign receive two injection ( shot ) either AMA1-C1 Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccine call HiberixÂ® ( Registered Trademark ) , approve use Mali . All shot give thigh muscle . Before first shot , small blood sample obtain make sure child well see antibody malaria parasite . The second shot give 4 week first . After shot , participant observe clinic 30 minute . They return clinic 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 14 day shot physical examination . Blood sample draw visit check side effect vaccine measure response . During rainy season second vaccination , subject come clinic month examination . Any child ill disease could malaria blood sample collect fingerstick test malaria learn malaria parasite cause infection . Every fourth visit fingerstick sample take regardless whether child sick . If child becomes sick time study , bring clinic examination ...</brief_summary>
