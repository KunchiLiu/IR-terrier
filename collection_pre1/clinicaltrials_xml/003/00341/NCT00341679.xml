	<brief_summary>This study define major genetic risk protective factor idiopathic inflammatory myopathy ( IIM ) , group immune disorder affect connective tissue muscle . It also identify new environmental risk factor IIM identify immune response myositis related disease . There many form IIMs , cause disease unknown . However , scientist suspect result people genetic factor predispose them-that , put great risk-are expose certain environmental trigger . Some trigger include food , drug , biologics ( vaccine prevent disease ) , medical device occupational exposure . Patients , include child 18 , diagnosis myositis , relate autoimmune disease , rheumatic disease , well blood relative , control subject good health already recruit study . The evaluation consist one outpatient visit patient 's doctor , obtain medical history conduct physician examination . Patients spend 20 30 minute answer write question . There blood collection 6 tablespoon . If major change patient ' medical condition , ask return second outpatient evaluation determine whether blood test antibody , show immune response , change . Blood sample collect used laboratory research study . The sample identify code , identify information remove . During study , researcher explore possible environmental risk factor , include study infectious non-infectious agent . They analyze blood genetic marker test certain antibody . Laboratory result evaluate relate sign , symptom , severity patient ' illness . That would help researcher well understand pattern diseases outcomes patient . This study direct benefit patient . However , result study make available patient ' doctor use appropriate care . Also , hop information gain help people future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Studies Natural History Pathogenesis Autoimmune/Connective Tissue Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals develop chronic harmful inflammation association self-reactive autoantibody T cell say autoimmune disease . The cause diseases unknown thought occur genetically susceptible individual exposure select environmental agent . There many form disease , focus one rare poorly-studied group autoimmune disorder , know Idiopathic Inflammatory Myopathies ( IIM ) . This heterogeneous group diseases include polymyositis , dermatomyositis related disorder . This natural history protocol design continue study disease begin evaluation relate connective tissue disorder associate environmental exposure . We plan delineate important group patient familial case , obtain useful material investigation clinical presentation , etiology , pathogenesis , immunologic abnormality autoimmune/connective tissue disease . Clinical data patient blood , urine tissue specimen collect refer physician send u . The blood sample separate cell plasma , frozen place cell plasma bank . Often diagnosis IIM confuse illness ( adult-onset dystrophy ) , therefore , also include patient illness ( refer preliminary diagnosis IIM unknown myopathy ) , include patient autoimmune disease . In order understand fully genetic risk factor disease , family member select patient several blood relative autoimmune connective tissue disease also study . In summary , natural history protocol attempt , series hypothesis-testing hypothesis-generating study , obtain new information regard clinical presentation , risk protective factor , pathogeneses prognostic feature myositis related condition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Recruitment study invitation . INCLUSION CRITERIA : For primary autoimmune myositis study population , child ( less 18 year age ) adult ( 18 year age ) require diagnosis myositis relate autoimmune rheumatic disorder . Family member need blood relative proband diagnosis autoimmune disease . Normal volunteer gender racematched subset autoimmune subject control need specific study . Normal volunteer good health , without recognize systemic rheumatic disorder autoimmune disease , take antiinflammatory medicine , include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) corticosteroid . For subject : ability subject parents/legal guardian provide inform consent aspect study full protocol information provide . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Exclusion criterion protocol subject : 1. medical illness judgment investigator allow safe blood draw clinical evaluation need study participation ; 2. cognitive impairment ; 3. inability give inform assent consent . Exclusion criterion normal volunteer : Recognized systemic rheumatic disorder autoimmune disease , history cancer take antiinflammatory medicine , include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) corticosteroid , severe trauma , infection vaccination within 8 week .</criteria>
