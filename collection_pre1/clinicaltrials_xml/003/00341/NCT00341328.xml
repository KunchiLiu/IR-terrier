	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety Mycobacterium w new lung tuberculosis patient . Mycobacterium w strain bacterium use vaccine adjunct drug leprosy . This agent also find useful treatment lung tuberculosis limit number patient . We conduct study category-I patient ( As per World Health Organization , Geneva classification tuberculosis ) lung tuberculosis see efficacy also see change immunological parameter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Immunomodulator Adjunct Therapy New Pulmonary Tuberculosis ( Category I ) Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mycobacterium w recently introduce immunomodulator , find useful rapid kill Mycobacterium leprae . It improve clearance Mycobacterium leprae body thereby useful reduce duration therapy significantly multibacillary leprosy . Mycobacterium w share antigens Mycobacterium leprae well Mycobacterium tuberculosis . Mycobacterium w also find useful prevention tuberculosis experimental animal . Previous study efficacy Mycobacterium w immunomodulator pulmonary tuberculosis patient show faster sputum conversion rate patient give Mycobacterium w adjuvant therapy along standard anti-tuberculosis treatment . It faster remarkable sputum convert capacity . Similar study conduct pulmonary TB category -II [ Re-treatment per Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme ( RNTCP ) , Govt . India ] patient show improved cure rate . Mycobacterium w commercially available brand name `` Immuvac '' injection 0.5 ml multi-dose vial approve use immunomodulator Mycobacterium leprae patient leprosy . Each vial 500 million heat-killed bacillus buffer solution . It manufacture Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. ; Ahmedabad , Gujarat-382 210 , India . In clinical trial one dose consist 0.1 ml give intradermal injection , contain 100 million bacillus . A total 6 dos give Intensive Phase ( per RNTCP , Ministry Health Family Welfare , Govt.of India ) treatment . Two injection upper arm day-0 subsequently one injection day 14,28,42 56 . No injection give Continuation Phase ( per RNTCP , Ministry Health Family Welfare , Govt.of India ) treatment . As commercially available therapeutic use TB patient immunomodulator.Therefore investigate Mycobacterium w efficacy TB patient `` double-blind placebo-controlled randomized clinical control trial '' fashion . We conduct trial Category-I pulmonary TB Patients ( per RNTCP , Ministry Health Family Welfare , Govt.of India ) , assess outcome form clinical improvement , sputum conversion immunological parameter . This multi-centric trial sponsor Department Biotechnology , Ministry Science Technology , Govt . India Cadila Pharmaceuticals Ltd. , India .</detailed_description>
