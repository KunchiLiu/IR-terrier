	<brief_summary>The objective study characterize gene associate either susceptibility resistance development nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) Chinese population incidence NPC high 50 100,000 . NPC remain unique model human malignancy understand multi-step carcinogenic process involve ubiquitous virus ( Epstein-Barr virus ) , environmental carcinogen , NPC susceptibility gene . Up 95 % NPC patient early late stage disease IgA antibody direct EBV virus VCA ( viral capsid antigen ) . Environmental factor also implicate significant risk factor development NPC . In addition , certain allele HLA gene show association NPC , perhaps concert family T-cell receptor gene ( TCR ) . Other data suggest microsatellite marker Chromosome 6 may associate NPC-disease associated gene .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study characterize gene associate either susceptibility resistance development nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) Chinese population incidence NPC high 50 100,000 . NPC remain unique model human malignancy understand multi-step carcinogenic process involve ubiquitous virus ( Epstein-Barr virus ) , environmental carcinogen , NPC susceptibility gene . Up 95 % NPC patient early late stage disease IgA antibody direct EBV virus VCA ( viral capsid antigen ) . Environmental factor also implicate significant risk factor development NPC . In addition , certain allele HLA gene show association NPC , perhaps concert family T-cell receptor gene ( TCR ) . Other data suggest microsatellite marker Chromosome 6 may associate NPC-disease associated gene . We use `` triad '' approach attempt dissociate genetic environmental viral association NPC incidence . Blood sample collect volunteer ( probands ) family member ( spouse child and/or parent patient ) two site Guangxi Province , China : Cancer Research Control Institute Wuzhou City ; Cang Wu County Cancer Hospital , locate 20 mile Wuzhou . All case EBV/IgA/VCA positive . These triad sample provide control haplotypic information case control . A database pertinent clinical family information create questionnaire fill hospital staff interviewer . Blood separate plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) . Plasma test Wuzhou Center EBV/IgA/VCA . The PBMCs viably frozen transport LGD NCI/FCRDC , transform lymphoblastoid cell line extraction DNA . At LGD DNAs screen informative polymorphism candidate gene DNA genotyping method . Association analyse perform detect linkage informative polymorphisms candidate gene DNA genotyping method . Association analyse perform detect linkage informative polymorphisms clinical family data . If marker associate development NC find , potential application diagnostics therapy . Further , identification allelic polymorphism gene role NPC progression would offer definitive tie gene carcinogenic process . Following study , sample maintain repository curated central Laboratory database . Loss destruction sample wil record database impact study participant way . We understand study subsequent completion protocol require additional OHSR/IRB approval prior commencement .</detailed_description>
