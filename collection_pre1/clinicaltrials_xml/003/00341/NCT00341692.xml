	<brief_summary>Breast cancer common cancer among woman United States . Breast cancer research hamper difficulty collect normal breast tissue . In study , researcher obtain sample normal breast tissue organ donor collect risk-factor data next-of-kin . The purpose study learn normal breast develop respond stress know increase woman chance develop breast cancer . Following breast-tissue donation 20 volunteer , surgical technician make small incision skin tissue breast remove several sample measure one-inch . Technicians also take sample uterine line estimate date last menstrual period . The tissue send National Cancer Institute laboratory research study .

	<brief_title>Studying Normal Breast Tissue Cancer Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot project , fund Breast Cancer Faculty Infrastructure Award , would determine feasibility obtain sample normal breast tissue organ donor collect risk factor data next-of-kin . The underlying goal initiative determine association stage breast development , risk factor breast cancer , gene expression . The study investigator member DCEG , CCR Transplant Resource Center Maryland ( TRC ) , non-profit organization certify HCFA state process organ tissue donation Maryland . Trained staff social worker employ TRC routinely obtain consent donation next-of-kin also obtain consent study . The exist consent form organ tissue donation also include informed consent donation tissue research . Following organ procurement 20 volunteer , train surgical technician employ TRC routinely assist intra-operatively , sterilely remove tissue breast quadrant split sample ; one portion embed OCT snap frozen liquid nitrogen fix 10 % buffer formalin . Samples adipose tissue , blood , urine endometrium ( menstrual dating ) also obtain . MES conjunction SMH BKV ass sample histopathologically determine quantity quality macromolecule ( RNA , DNA , protein ) contain within tissue . Pending demonstration feasibility general approach , pursue additional funding large study optimize procedure . We stop recruit patient .</detailed_description>
