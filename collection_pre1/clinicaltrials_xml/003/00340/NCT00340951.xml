	<brief_summary>This study evaluate ability lung transplant recipient react transplanted organ . Previous research indicate immune test identify whether people risk chronic rejection transplant lung . Certain parameter , , physical property involve immune system , may cause acute chronic rejection lung , may lead chronic rejection , condition scar worsens lung function . If parameter identify distinguish found healthy subject , information gain help medical professional provide individualized treatment work immune system . Short-term long-term survival lung transplant recipient may thus improve . Patients lung transplant recruit clinical transplant coordinator . Normal control subject recruit flyer newspaper advertisement . Collection blood sample do Duke University Medical Center . Blood collection do patient undergo routine pretransplant posttransplant blood test , extra blood collection require . Control subject undergo three blood collection 8-week period . They compensate time participate , rate $ 5 initial blood draw , $ 10 second one , $ 15 third one . A small amount blood involve , 3 tablespoon . The blood cell DNA ( contain genetic material ) isolate analysis . Patients ' DNA sample collect identified code , identify information remove . The sample may use future new test develop . This study direct benefit participant . However , study , find patient inherit risk disease likely cause early death disease treat , researcher attempt notify patient . Overall , hop information gather enhance researcher ' understanding test best identify patient risk develop chronic rejection transplant lung .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Immune Parameters Predict Acute Chronic Rejection Lung Recipients ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study provide insight immune mechanism involve pre- posttransplant response lung recipient determine short- long-term graft outcome predict allow potential intervention . We assemble panel assay test various function immune response investigate immune mechanism involve acute chronic rejection ( CR ) . Our overall hypothesis measurment pre- posttransplant immune response donor HLA antigens/peptides predict graft outcome . Our goal determine immune parameter [ ELISpot ] , intracellular T regulatory cell ATP synthesis identify lung recipient high risk develop AR sub-clinical rejection . Sub-aim : To determine correlation cytokine genotype ELISpot result T regulatory cell level activity recipient high risk develop acute rejection comparison normal subject cohort . A second hypothesis recipient experience AR episode remain responsive donor antigen show increase reactivity donor HLA peptides high risk develop CR . Our goal determine immune parameter ( CFSE responder frequency response donor peptide assay CFSE , ELISpot , T regulatory cell level , ATP synthesis ) identify lung recipient high risk develop CR distinguish immune parameter normal subject cohort . If successful , provide clinician information necessary individualization immunosuppression intervention aim improve short long-term graft outcome .</detailed_description>
