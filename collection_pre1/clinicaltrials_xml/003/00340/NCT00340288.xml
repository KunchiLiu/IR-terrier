	<brief_summary>Uterine leiomyoma , commonly call fibroid , major health concern woman reproductive age . The objective study describe herein investigate growth dynamic uterine leiomyomas clinically relevant population woman . We test hypothesis uterine leiomyomas heterogeneous term growth characteristic clinical symptom outcomes , difference leiomyoma growth dynamic discriminate molecular marker cellular phenotype . Participants include 300 premenopausal woman ( great 18 year old ) least one uterine leiomyoma . The inclusion criterion patient enrollment confirm diagnosis leiomyoma ultrasound . At least one leiomyoma must equal great 2 cm diameter uterus must enlarge size typical eigth week pregnancy . After enrollment informed consent , T1- T2-weighted magnetic resonance image ( MRI ) scan conduct begin first visit 3 , 6 , 12 month . Each patient physical exam , provide urine blood sample MRI visit , respond initial extensive telephone-administered questionnaire follow abbreviate monthly questionnaire update . A number enrol woman require surgical intervention ( hysterectomy/myomectomy ) standard care . If surgery outcome woman enrol study , MRI conduct surgery surgical pathologist map uterine leiomyoma comparison MRI . Leiomyoma sample analyze histopathological molecular change correlate growth . Because hysterectomy myomectomy common outcome woman leiomyomas , anticipate tissue available least 100 300 woman study . For woman opt surgery , also administer brief ( le 5 minute ) questionnaire clarify reason elect surgery . Upon completion data collection , able compare leiomyoma growth function multiplicity location ; examine relationship leiomyoma growth clinical symptom outcome ; identify molecular , cellular , pathological characteristic leiomyomas differ growth dynamic ; examine endocrinological parameter lifestyle factor related differential growth dynamic uterine leiomyoma . The data may use establish clinical severity scale establish diagnostic marker currently available uterine leiomyoma .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Women include study must least 18 year age , premenopausal , speak English , one uterine leiomyoma least 2 cm diameter utuerus must enlarge size typical 8th week pregnancy . Note selcetion criteia set recruit woman surgical intervention likely outcome , surgery requirement study inclusion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Women exclude pregnant potential safety concern associate image image contrast enhancement . If woman become pregnant study , wil option stay study , pelvic ultrasound scan place MRI scan . Women take likely start take GnRH therapy exclude therapy , use treatment method leiomyoma , sometmes induces regression . Women great 52 inch circumference great 350 pound exclude large fit imaging equipment . Women intrauterine device ( IUD ) exclude metal device create 'shadowing ' MR image , make accurate measurement interpretation leiomyoma MRIs difficult . Women exclude prior myomectomy , take oral contraceptive . The inclusion woman premenopausal age ( great 18 year old ) study dictate nature condition .</criteria>
