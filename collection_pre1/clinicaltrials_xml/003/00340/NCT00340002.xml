	<brief_summary>A major goal perinatal care accurately diagnose fetal anomaly prior birth . This capability allow clinician make prudent decision regard antepartum care , delivery site , postnatal therapy . Three-dimensional ultrasound recent technology provide new way evaluate fetus . This technique allow one scan digital ultrasound volume dataset , visualize organ different perspective , measure volume , render anatomical feature computer processing . However , accurate characterization fetal anomaly technique must interpret relation normal fetal anatomy different stage pregnancy . We continue develop image reference library fetal anatomy identify key diagnostic feature three-dimensional ultrasound . A cross-sectional observational study 1,400 fetus catalog broad spectrum congenital malformation various gestational age . The protocol include 400 example normal fetal anatomy three-dimensional ultrasonography . All case place digital image database . For anomaly category , volume reconstruction compare normal anatomy specific gestational age . Key diagnostic finding document correlated postnatal outcome . We anticipate result permit improved diagnostic interpretation congenital defect throughout pregnancy .</brief_summary>

However , accurate characterization fetal anomaly technique must interpret relation normal fetal anatomy different stage pregnancy . We continue develop image reference library fetal anatomy identify key diagnostic feature three-dimensional ultrasound . A cross-sectional observational study 7,000 fetus catalog broad spectrum congenital malformation various gestational age . A subset fetuses enrol protocol also examine Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) identify potential advantage limitation image modality compare 3DUS diagnosis congenital anomaly . The protocol include 400 example normal fetal anatomy three-dimensional ultrasonography . All case place digital image database . For anomaly category , volume data acquire specific gestational age . Key diagnostic feature document correlated postnatal outcome . Postnatal correlative study may include ultrasound , MRI , X-ray , computerize tomography ( CT ) , photography . We anticipate result permit improved diagnostic interpretation congenital defect throughout pregnancy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All pregnant subject recruit informed consent either Hutzel William Beaumont Hospitals . The study population arm protocol involve pregnant woman great equal 15 year . CROSSSECTIONAL ARM OF PROTOCOL NORMAL FETUS SUBJECTS : 3DUS STUDIES : No fetal anomaly suspect 2DUS . Excellent visualization normal fetal anatomy 2DUS . Accurate date criterion 1st trimester scan and/or menstrual history . FETAL MRI STUDIES : Gestational age 1842 menstrual week . No known fetal abnormality . CROSSSECTIONAL ARM OF PROTOCOL ABNORMAL FETUSES : 3DUS STUDIES : Congenital anomaly suspect 2DUS . Accurate date criterion 1st trimester scan and/or menstrual history . FETAL MRI STUDIES : Gestational age 1842 menstrual week . Suspected fetal abnormality . POSTMORTEM STUDIES : Suspected fetal abnormality prenatal ultrasound . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : CROSSSECTIONAL ARM OF PROTOCOL NORMAL FETUS SUBJECTS : 3DUS STUDIES : Poor visualization fetus due technical factor ( e.g . obesity , surgical scar ) . History noncompliance prenatal visit current prior pregnancy . FETAL MRI STUDIES : Inability patient fit bore MRI system . Metallic implant would increase risk patient . Previous occupational exposure metal shop . History claustrophobia . CROSSSECTIONAL ARM OF PROTOCOL ABNORMAL FETUSES : 3DUS STUDIES : Poor fetal visualization technical factor ( e.g . obesity decrease amniotic fluid ) . FETAL MRI STUDIES : Inability patient fit bore MRI system . Metallic implant would increase risk patient . Previous occupational exposure metal shop . History claustrophobia . POSTMORTEM STUDIES : Refusal sign inform consent postmortem image study .</criteria>
