	<detailed_description>In 1976 accidental explosion chemical plant 16 mile north Milan result contamination local population 2 , 3 , 7 , 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-para-dioxin ( TCDD ) .

The Seveso accident provide unique opportunity epidemiological investigation exposure high record human , exposure involve TCDD without contaminant , cohort involve surround area enumerate . There inter-individual variation action gene involve TCDD effect human cell . The quality human AH receptor , CYP1A1 arnt genotype example susceptibility marker may identify subject high risk TCDD-related disease . A hypothesis could explain inconsistent association TCDD exposure cancer genetic susceptibility may influence individual adversely affect TCDD exposure . The study three phase . The first pilot/validation study 126 highly expose expose subject . The second case-control study 100 individual chloracne 100 control . The field component phase one two complete . The third final phase plan case-control study TCDD-related cancer include approximately 125 case 125 control . Using different method estimate TCDD level detection limit , find , approximately 20 year accident , plasma TCDD still elevate subject expose area , particularly woman , negatively associate IgG plasma level . Subjects develop chloracne accident high TCDD level , evidence TCDD-related long-term toxicity . The analysis expression key gene aryl hydrocarbon receptor ( AhR ) pathway , necessary TCDD effect , show significant reduction AhR expression increase plasma dioxin level . Cytochrome P450 gene SNPs haplotype associate variable TCDD-related gene inducibility . On-going study examine proteomics gene expression pattern ( microarray ) expose subject compare exposed individual , frerquency ( 14 ; 18 ) translocation lymphocytes subject . The study include questionnaire/interview biospecimen collection ; 73 ml blood obtain participant .</detailed_description>
