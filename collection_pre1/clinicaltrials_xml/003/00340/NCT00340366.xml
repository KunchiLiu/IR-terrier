	<brief_summary>This study examine body metabolizes micronutrient , vitamin , pregnancy genetic make-up influence metabolism . Vitamin B12 folate level pregnancy link birth defect , neural tube defect , orofacial cleft , congenital heart disease . Other micronutrient level may relate birth defect pregnancy complication . This study characterize pattern micronutrient status pregnancy compare genetic variant biochemical parameter . Information relationship gene vitamin metabolism may help doctor advise woman nutritional requirement pregnancy protect health health baby . This study collaboration NIH Trinity College Dublin , Ireland . Women Irish origin 18 year age old receive prenatal care Coombe Women 's Hospital Dublin may enrol . Fathers also may participate . Upon enter study , female participant complete questionnaire relate food vitamin intake , alcohol consumption , smoke behavior , use medication , provide blood sample . Additional blood sample collect routine clinic visit 24 34 week pregnancy , delivery 6 week 2 month baby 's birth . Permission request obtain blood sample umbilical cord birth remove baby . Fathers baby also ask answer short questionnaire provide DNA sample genetic study . To collect DNA , sterile cotton swab rub around inside mouth obtain cheek cell DNA extract .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A number genetic polymorphism influence human folate , vitamin B12 relate micronutrient level . Vitamin B12 folate level pregnancy link birth defect include neural tube defect , orofacial cleft , congenital heart disease . Additionally , related analytes , homocysteine , may relate birth defect pregnancy complication . The behavior maternal serum micronutrient relate analytes throughout human pregnancy well describe . In study , aim characterize pattern micronutrient status pregnancy . We plan perform biochemical analysis serial blood sample collect 500 pregnant woman five interval span early pregnancy post partum period . We also characterize neonatal micronutrient status use specimen umbilical cord blood . These blood specimen , well buccal swab specimen collect father , also evaluate measure influence genetic variant metabolite level . The major outcome measure longitudinal maternal micronutrient level aggregate alleel frequency among family triad . Comparisons make presence genetic variant , biochemical parameter , clinical phenotype . At late date also plan study metabolic genetic parameter large cohort healthy individual . Characterizing biochemical genetic variant provide insight metabolic process normal complicated pregnancy .</detailed_description>
