	<brief_summary>This study , do collaboration Johns Hopkins University School Public Health Baltimore , Maryland , examine role gene development atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) patient undergo kidney dialysis . The rate illness death CVD among patient dialysis extraordinarily high , account 50 percent death . Blood level inflammatory marker elevate patient , strongly predict illness death CVD . The discovery gene variant related inflammatory process atherosclerotic CVD may lead good medical treatment improve survival patient end-stage kidney disease . Participants John 's Hopkins University 's CHOICE ( Choices Healthy Outcomes Caring End-Stage Renal Disease ) program include study . Blood sample previously collect patient analyzed laboratory gene might associate inflammatory process atherogenesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The CHOICE ( Choices Healthy Outcomes Caring End stage renal disease ) study national prospective cohort study 1,041 incident dialysis patient age 19 95 recruit 81 dialysis clinic October 1995 June 1998 , overseen Johns Hopkins University School Public Health . The discovery genetic association offer potential direct clinical management order prevent ASCVD ( Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ) improve survival patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Objectives : In Collaboration investigator CHOICE cohort , propose assess role variant gene related inflammatory process atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) incidence . Eligibility : Eligibility independent age , race , ethnicity , gender . However , participant cohort less 19 year age . Design : Frozen buffy coat 871 patient send LGD , DNA extract . Singles nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) within cod region , upstream downstream regulatory region intronic region candidate gene genotyped . The first candidate gene study include IL6 , IL10 , TGFB1 , Beta Fibrinogen , LTA , STAT3 . Blood sample relevant clinical data provide Johns Hopkins University School Public Health , Department Epidemiology numerical code link sample clinical data . While Johns Hopkins University retain patient identifier information , LGD way identify person blood , subsequent DNA , clinical data obtain . The sample maintain repository curated central Laboratory database . Destruction loss clinical sample data record database impact study participant way . At completion protocol , retain sample future use . We understand study subsequent completion protocol require additional OHSR/IRB approval prior commencement .</detailed_description>
