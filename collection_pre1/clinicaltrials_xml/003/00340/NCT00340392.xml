	<brief_summary>Background : - Cancer stem cell breast cancer identify small population tumor cell whose self-renewal mechanism highly deregulate . This deregulation seem necessary cancer develop . - These cell identify certain surface marker overlap marker associate normal embryonic stem cell . Objective : To isolate tumor stem cell use method generally use isolate human embryonic stem cell . Eligibility : - Tissue sample obtain human cooperative network . - Samples include normal tissue individual opportunistic disease individual cancer . Design : Breast cancer stem cell isolate , grown laboratory characterize .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cancers compose heterogeneous population cell vary degree proliferative capacity ability reconstitute tumor transplant nude SCID mouse . Recently , cancer stem cell identify small population tumor cell possess stem cell property self-renewal pathway highly deregulate . This deregulation seem prerequisite development cancer .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The tissue sample come human cooperative network . They set criterion . We request tissue sample individual normal well cancer . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The tissue sample come human cooperative tissue network ask normal sample individual n't opportunistic disease .</criteria>
