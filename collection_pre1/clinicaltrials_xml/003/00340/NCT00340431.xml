	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety two experimental malaria vaccine healthy volunteer examine immune response . Safety assess compare vaccine side effect group volunteer receive increase dos vaccine ( dose-escalating study ) . Immune response evaluate comparing level antibody production dose . ( Antibodies infection-fighting protein produce immune system . ) The two vaccine study contain different type malaria protein call MSP1 : one type MSP142FVO MSP1423D7 . Malaria parasites spread person person mosquito . There four type malaria parasite . The vaccine test study design work Plasmodium falciparum , parasite responsible death child due malaria sub-Saharan Africa . The vaccine stimulate body produce antibody prevent P. falciparum enter person 's red blood cell . Healthy normal volunteer 18 50 year age may eligible 12-month study , conduct Quintiles Phase 1 Services Lenexa , Kansas . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Participants receive three dos vaccine-on first day study ( day 0 ) , 1 month ( day 28 ) , 6 month ( day 180 ) -through injection arm muscle . The first group subject receive 5 microgram vaccine , second group receive 20 microgram , third group receive 80 microgram . All participant observe clinic 30 minute immunization immediate reaction vaccine keep record temperature reaction side effect experience 6 day vaccination . At various interval throughout study , participant undergo brief physical examination blood test . Women childbearing potential urine pregnancy test day injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Experimental Vaccine Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase 1 clinical trial evaluate safety immunogenicity two asexual blood stage vaccine Plasmodium falciparum malaria , MSP1 ( 42 ) -FVO/Alhydrogel MSP1 ( 42 ) -3D7/Alhydrogel , healthy adult volunteer . Between 2-3 million death occur year result malaria . Most deaths result P. falciparum malaria , child five year age , sub-Saharan Africa . A safe effective vaccine would reduce morbidity mortality secondary P. falciparum infection would valuable resource fight disease . The merozoite surface protein 1 ( MSP1 ) first protein identify surface blood stage parasite . A portion MSP1 carry newly invade erythrocyte surface parasite . Clinical symptom malaria human due asexual blood stage . Therefore , vaccine design protect individual illness due asexual stage P. falciparum infection inhibit parasite invasion erythrocyte . The MSP1 ( 42 ) /Alhydrogel vaccine use five preclinical animal trial clinically significant risk identify . The study conduct Quintiles Phase I Services ( Lenexa , KS ) . We evaluate three dose level MSP1 ( 42 ) -FVO/Alhydrogel MSP1 ( 42 ) -3D7/Alhydrogel vaccine ( 5 micro g , 20 micro g , 80 micro g ) . Sixty healthy male non-pregnant female volunteer age 18 50 enrol . Ten volunteer group receive 5 micro g , 20 micro g , 80 mirco g dose either MSP1 ( 42 ) -FVO MSP1 ( 42 ) -3D7 vaccine intramuscular injection open label study month 0 , 1 , 6 . The group stagger adequate safety evaluation perform prior dose escalation . The duration study 12 month per volunteer . The primary objective trial determine frequency severity vaccine-related adverse event dose . The secondary objective determine dose generate high serum antibody level homologous MSP1 ( 42 ) antigen Day 42 .</detailed_description>
