	<brief_summary>The propose research intend construct set tissue microarrays contain different type normal lung cancer tissue study gene associate lung cancer . Thus far generated lung cancer tissue arrayusing paraffin embed archival tissue 300 lung turmors tissue 100 adjacent normal tissue . Four- micrometer thickness section cut tissue array use survey gene expression status array tumor use immunohistochemistry methody . We currently perform IHC study ot 1 ) determine protein expression correlation gene expression patterms ovserved use cDNA array . 2 ) Analyze protein expression chromosome remodel pathyway non-small cell lung cancer . And 3 ) determine association gene expression lung tumor stage clinical outcome . The current protocol need complete study production neuroendocrine tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research intend construct set tissue microarrays contain different type lung cancer tissue study gene associate lung cancer . In study , lung tissue array generate use paraffin embed archival tissue contain adjacent normal tissue tumor approximately 300 non-small cell lung cancer 100 neuroendocrine tumor lung . Corded tissue 0.6 um diameter take tumor array onto recipient paraffin block generate lung tumor specific microarray . Four-micrometer thickness section cut tissue array use survey gene expression status array tumor use fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH , situ hybridization , and/or immunohistochemistry method . Additionally , approximately 20 section cut primary tumor block isolate genomic DNA analysis genetic change array tumor sample . The goal proposal 1 ) generate single tissue block contain multiple tumor , 2 ) allow rapid efficient analysis gene expression large number sample use single tissue section , 3 ) correlate molecular change tumor clinical pathological feature disease . Due experimental nature research fact tumor obtain archival tissue AFIP , investigator report result gene expression back subject . To date , sample need protocol reach patient accrual survival status patient well molecular analysis use construct lung tissue microarrays continue foreseeable future .</detailed_description>
