	<brief_summary>We propose conduct population-based case-control study facial cleft ( cleft lip palate ) Norwegian newborn . Cleft lip palate one common type birth defect , genetic environmental cause suspect . This project combine test recently-discovered gene associate facial clefting personal interview mother soon birth . With information expect able ass combine role genetic susceptibility environmental exposure causation facial cleft . We plan enroll 750 case 1100 control five year . This provide 2:1 ratio control case large sub-category facial cleft ( cleft lip without cleft palate ) . This study conduct collaboration US National Institute Environmental Health Sciences , Norwegian Institute Public Health/Medical Birth Registry . Norway offer unique opportunity carry study . First , Norwegian baby facial cleft treat one two medical center expense national government . Our collaboration two clinic provide access virtually every case bear country . Second , Medical Birth Registry maintain file newborn baby , control infant randomly draw whole population . Random population control gold standard study , seldom feasible . Third , blood sample Norwegian newborn send one laboratory analysis PKU . Our collaboration PKU laboratory permit mother control infant consent study baby 's blood without submit baby additional needle stick . Mothers case control initially contact physician , ask participate telephone interview . With consent , mother also ask provide biological sample analysis gene predispose facial cleft . We collect cheek swab control mother infant . Case mother ask provide additional blood sample cheek swab intensive study genetic factor within family . Protection privacy paramount . Mothers case infant give option receive individual result , consult panel ethicist expert agree information beneficial . Analysis presentation data carry jointly US Norwegian investigator .</brief_summary>
