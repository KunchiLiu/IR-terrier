	<brief_summary>This study construct tissue microarrays ( TMAs ) pertain childhood cancer . TMA technology recently develop one allow evaluate hundred tissue sample simultaneously DNA , RNA , protein level . The goal identify potential molecular signature . Cancer drug discovery currently focus identify drug target molecular level . Such drug would selective specific protein signal pathway directly involve origin tumor . However , origin cancer among adults differs cancer diagnose child . The overall approach pharmaceutical industry develop drug likely aim low-incidence cancer , childhood cancer . Thus , researcher study propose create childhood cancer TMA include specimen wide range solid tumor present poor prognosis patient . This TMA would turn use identify antibody lead develop molecularly target drug would reach clinical trial adult . TMAs create robotically . Small tissue core take paraffin-embedded tissue block implant new paraffin block . The recipient block process produce several hundred specimen evaluate single glass slide . Specimens represent 17 distinct kind pediatric solid tumor use study . Also include sample plexiform neurofibroma-that , benign growth nervous connective tissue . Tissue specimens come patient age 25 young time diagnosis cancer plexiform neurofibroma . No procedure perform sole purpose obtain tissue study . The TMA develop study commercialize . The result individual whose tumor specimen use array send patient treat physician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Childhood Cancer Plexiform Neurofibroma Tissue Microarray Molecular Target Screening Clinical Drug Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cancer drug discovery focus identify molecularly target drug selective specific protein signal pathway directly involve tumorigenesis . This new paradigm alters approach clinical drug development childhood cancer emphasis therapeutic target present common epithelially-derived adult cancer , different pathogenesis . The pharmaceutical industry unlikely undertake target discovery program low incidence cancer , childhood cancer . Therefore , pragmatic approach development molecularly target drug child require . Objective : Construct childhood cancer tissue microarrays ( TMA ) screen select appropriate molecularly target agent clinical development childhood cancer . Eligibility : Ten twenty representative specimen ( paraffin block ) 25 histologically distinct pediatric solid tumor plexiform neurofibromas collect . Design : Using robotic arrayer , three 0.6 mm core tissue block donate one 3 recipient paraffin TMA block ( CNS tumor , sarcoma , embryonal tumor ) . Standard immunohistochemical technique apply 5 micro section TMA block use validated antibody direct specific protein target interest . If great 8 20 tumor specific histological type cancer positive , 95 % probability true proportion positive specimen exceed 20 % . The result TMA target assessment guide selection molecularly target drug pediatric phase I clinical trial POB Pediatric Phase I/Pilot Consortium selection candidate tumor activity test phase II clinical trial . If clinical response observe phase I II trial tumor type express target TMA , return original paraffin block perform Laser Capture Microdissection produce reverse-phase lysate protein microarrays assess activation state target signal pathway investigate role target protein tumorigenesis responsive childhood cancer .</detailed_description>
