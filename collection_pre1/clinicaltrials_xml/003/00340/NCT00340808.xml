	<brief_summary>This study , sponsor NCI Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) , collect tissue sample woman cancer endometrium ( line uterus ) . Researchers use sample learn endometrial cancer develop new treatment method prevention . Women endometrial cancer suitable candidate surgery prior retroperitoneal surgery pelvic abdominal radiation therapy may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood test , endometrial biopsy ( surgical removal small tissue sample ) dilation curettage ( D &amp; C ) . Participants undergo hysterectomy ( surgery remove uterus ) along removal fallopian tubes ovary . This standard surgical treatment endometrial cancer . Lymph node pelvis near main blood vessel abdomen also remove determine disease spread node . If cancer find involve site , cancer area may also remove ; examination tissue determine therapy beyond surgery need . Before surgery , patient complete 20-minute questionnaire include question background , reproductive history , menstruation menopause , certain surgery , birth control pills hormone replacement therapy , drug medicine , weight height , smoking , medical history , family history cancer . Some tissue remove surgery , plus urine sample collect catheter bag surgery , blood drawn surgery follow-up visit 6 week 3 year surgery , send GOG Tissue Bank Columbus , Ohio . This bank store , process , distribute biological specimen patient agree participate study conduct GOG . Patients follow-up visit 6 week surgery , every 6 month next 2 year , follow annually next 7 year , total 10-year follow-up . The visit include examination question health status treatment receive visit . Patients whose cancer return worsen undergo another tumor biopsy , possible , time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Staging Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GOG-210 molecular surgico-pathological staging study endometrial carcinoma . The overall goal pilot protocol improve outcome and/or quality life patient endometrial cancer . This fundamental goal accomplish development accurate model risk , identification candidate target therapeutic intervention utilization individualize treatment base molecular characteristic identify tumor tissue , normal tissue and/or readily accessible biological fluid , like serum urine . This molecular surgico-pathological staging study structure collect tissue , urine , serum , epidemiologic clinical data approximately 3,500 patient endometrial cancer identify participate GOG institution . All patient surgically-pathologically stag , consistently evaluate , treat need , follow 10 year surgery document treatment outcome . A series independent integrate research project undertaken utilize high-throughput methodology ( e.g. , genomics proteomics ) traditional technique ( e.g. , immunoassay ) examine cellular extracellular factor , include chromosome , DNA , RNA , proteins , lipid carbohydrate . The result obtain comprehensive laboratory test perform clinical specimen clinical epidemiologic data collect GOG-0210 patient represent endure resource endometrial cancer research study factor control growth spread endometrial cancer , predict response therapy risk disease spread , recurrence overall survival patient disease . This first implementation NCI-developed epidemiologic questionnaire , allow GOG protocol systematically uniformly collect demographic epidemiologic data enhance analytic capability study . If successful , study serve model protocol implement epidemiologic questionnaire .</detailed_description>
