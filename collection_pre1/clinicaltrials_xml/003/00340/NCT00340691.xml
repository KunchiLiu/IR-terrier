	<brief_summary>This study examine : 1 ) safety effectiveness drug doxycycline reduce number Mansonella perstans ( Mp ) worm blood infected patient , 2 ) effect doxycycline follow albendazole ivermectin treatment lymphatic filariasis , cause parasitic worm Wuchereria bancofti ( Wb ) . Both Mp Wb small filarial worm spread mosquito . Some people infect Mp Wb . Although people become ill infection parasite , develop symptom . Wb cause swelling arm , leg , breast , scrotum , progress permanent swell leg arm call elephantiasis . Mp cause itching , swell , fever , headache , symptom . Ivermectin albendazole medicine use treat lymphatic filariasis . They eliminate Wb parasite blood affect Mp . Doxycycline use treat many kind infection also recently show reduce number filarial worm several type filarial infection . The drug may useful Mp infection well . Residents Sabougou nearby village Mali infect Mp parasite , 14 65 year age , good health , pregnant breastfeeding , weigh least 40 kg ( 88 lb ) may eligible study . They may may also infect Wb . Candidates screen brief medical history physical examination blood test look infection Mp Wb . Participants undergo complete physical examination medical history . Blood drawn routine blood test . Participants randomly assign one four treatment group , follow : 1 ) doxycycline 6 week ; 2 ) doxycycline 6 week follow single dose albendazole ivermectin give 6 month begin doxycycline treatment ; 3 ) single dose albendazole ivermectin give 6 month begin doxycycline treatment ; 4 ) treatment . Only patient infect Wb receive albendazole ivermectin treatment . All participant , whether receive doxycycline , come clinic every day 6 week .

	<brief_title>Doxycycline Treat Mansonella Perstans Infection Patients With Without Lymphatic Filariasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mansonella perstans ( Mp ) infection common area Africa endemic Wuchereria bancrofti ( Wb ) , causative agent lymphatic filariasis . The clinical immunologic contribution Mp infection set unknown , part lack response Mp standard antifilarial therapy . The recent discovery bacterial endosymbionts ( Wolbachia ) number filarial specie , include Mp , lead new therapeutic option reduce microfilaremia . Volunteers age 14 65 screened order identify 240 volunteer ( 160 Wb+Mp+ 80 Wb-Mp+ ) participation open label randomize trial doxycycline ( 200 mg daily 6 week ) . Wb+Mp+ subject randomize receive single dose treatment albendazole ivermectin 4 month completion doxycycline treatment treatment . Clinical , parasitologic immunologic assessment perform prior initiation treatment 6 month 1 year 3 year follow initiation treatment . The efficacy doxycycline treatment reduce Mp microfilaremia assess subject without Wb coinfection . In addition , effect subsequent administration albendazole/ivermectin Mp clearance assess coinfected subject .</detailed_description>
