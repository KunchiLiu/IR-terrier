	<brief_summary>Study evaluate utility prospective HLA-B*5701 screening incidence abacavir hypersensitivity ( ABC HSR ) 1800 previously ABC-naive adult HIV-1 Europe , Australia country applicable . The study two ( co-primary ) objective : ) determine screen HLA-B*5701 prior ABC-containing HAART result low incidence clinically-suspected HSR versus current standard care ( genetic screening ) ii ) determine screen HLA-B*5701 prior ABC-containing HAART , result significantly low incidence immunologically-confirmed HSR versus current standard care ( genetic screening patch test ) . The study consist 28-day screening period , randomised observation period ( Day 1 Week 6 ) , subject experience suspect ABC HSR subset ABC-tolerant subject , epicutaneous patch test ( EPT ) assessment period . Eligible subject randomise one two study arm : Current Standard Care Arm ( prospective genetic screening : Control ) Genetic Screening Arm ( prospective genetic screening ) . Subjects identify HLA-B*5701 positive prospective Genetic Screening Arm receive ABC exclude study . Subjects experience suspect ABC HSR 6-week observation withdrawn ABC-containing product undergo EPT patch test 6 week later .</brief_summary>
