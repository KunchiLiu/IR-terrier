	<detailed_description>Recent cohort study demonstrate reduced breast cancer risk among woman history fracture low bone mineral density ( BMD ) . In Study Osteoporotic Fractures , standard deviation increase distal radius BMD associate 50 % increase risk three year follow-up , Framingham study , woman high quartile metacarpal bone mass 3.5-fold high risk woman low quartile . The impact severity time bone loss risk investigate , extent risk factor ( family history , lifestyle , exogenous hormone ) modify relationship BMD unknown . To elaborate research question , conduct follow-up study postmenopausal woman volunteer Fracture Intervention Trial ( FIT ) , trial bone-enhancing drug alendronate . The BFIT follow-up study include 15,595 22,695 FIT volunteer . Surviving member FIT contact ascertain incident cancer provide update risk factor fracture history self-administered questionnaire . To supplement baseline serum sample , use nest case-control approach collect buccal cell specimens biomarker measurement , include endogenous hormone genetic polymorphism involve either bone growth ( e.g. , vitamin D receptor ) hormone metabolism ( e.g. , CYPI7 , COMT ) . Operative pathology report use validate self-reported cancer . The social security number contact names provide FIT participant baseline facilitate comprehensive follow-up National Death Index search could locate . This large cohort include extensive baseline information major breast cancer risk factor , thus ideal evaluate potential interaction BMD effect BMD cancer site . Endometrial cancer report occur frequently among woman history fracture , previous study investigate relationship BMD . We investigate whether proximal femur BMD predict breast cancer risk ; whether breast cancer risk factor among postmenopausal woman modify relationship BMD ; whether BMD predict cancer risk ; whether biomarkers offer etiologic clue BMD cancer risk . Currently , examine : 1 ) relationship serum adipocytokines endometrial cancer risk , 2 ) relationship serum estrogens metabolite postmenopausal breast cancer risk . The baseline follow-up data collection additional biospecimens enable u answer important question BMD cancer .</detailed_description>
