	<brief_summary>Background : Alveolar soft part sarcoma ( ASPS ) rare tumor . ASPS resistant chemotherapy radiation . ASPS characterize slow growth . Currently vitro vivo model ASPS exist use experimental therapeutic study biological investigation . Primary Objectives : Acquisition blood tissue patient ASPS . Acquisition blood healthy control comparison blood patient ASPS . These control sample obtain study NCI Frederick Protocol OH99-C-N046 . Eligibility : Subjects age diagnosis primary metastatic alveolar soft part sarcoma undergo medically indicate surgery disease . Design : Patients Alveolar Soft Part Sarcoma ( ASPS ) eligible study . Biopsy tissue obtain additional sample time medically indicated procedure . Blood sample may collect initial visit follow-up visit . Specific risk describe separate consent obtain time biopsy . Tumor sample blood sample process and/or store use research effort laboratory Dr. David Vistica , National Cancer Institute , Frederick , MD . Additionally , blood sample obtain healthy volunteer comparison patient ASPS . These control sample obtain National Cancer Institute Frederick Protocol OH99-C-N046 .</brief_summary>
