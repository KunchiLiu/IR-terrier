	<brief_summary>This study determine whether certain gene alteration serve marker early detection prostate cancer . Prostate cancer often diagnose detect high level protein call prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) blood . Other condition also cause elevate PSA level , however , additional test need distinguish benign cancerous prostate condition . Patients 40 75 year age refer Howard University Hospital Washington , D.C. , Madigan Army Medical Center Tacoma , Washington , ultrasound needle biopsy diagnose prostate cancer may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure time biopsy visit : - Blood collection : Patients 10 milliliter ( 2 teaspoon ) blood drawn . - Prostate massage : Patients rectal examination prostate massage . For latter procedure , physician lightly massage prostate gland 15 second . After massage , patient provide urine specimen . - Biopsy : A small sample tumor tissue remove surgically examination microscope . Patients whose initial biopsy show cancer cell , advise repeat biopsy future give blood , urine , biopsy specimen time next biopsy . Patients diagnosed prostate cancer undergo surgery remove tumor small sample tumor tissue set aside study look substance may help predict prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In U.S. , screen prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) widespread consider effective early detection screen prostate cancer although problem associate use . Only 30-40 % men elevate PSA diagnose cancer initial biopsy . The 60-70 % diagnose either benign prostatic hyperplasia low-or high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia ( LGPIN HGPIN ) . Due persistent elevate PSA level , men undergo repeat biopsy many subsequently diagnose cancer ( false negative rate biopsy pathological diagnosis benign LGPIN report 13-19 % HGPIN 50-70 % ) . We propose conduct pilot study evaluate whether ( ) addition molecular marker ( e.g. , tumor-specific gene methylation GSTPI , CD44 , Annexin II , Caveolin 1 ) detectable serum and/or urine sediment prostatic massage improve prediction prostate cancer ( ii ) addition tumor-specific gene methylation detectable core-needle biopsy specimen improve sensitivity core-needle biopsy diagnosis prostate cancer among patient screen two Urology clinic locate Howard University , Washington , DC Madigan Army Medical Center , Tacoma , WA . Preliminary study show detection hypermethylated gene urine sediment prostatic massage men elevate PSA ( great 4ng/ml ) improve specificity PSA 73 % 98 % . Further , DNA hypermethylation tumor-specific gene also identify serum . In laboratory , develop assay evaluate DNA hypermethylation several gene show important prostate carcinogenesis . These assay highly sensitive ( able detect 20 tumor cell methylated DNA ) specific ( distinguish methylated normal DNA ratio 1 tumor cell 10,000 normal cell ) , could serve add value current prostate cancer screen modality .</detailed_description>
