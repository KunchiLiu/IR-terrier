	<brief_summary>This study examine existence genetic region believe bring risk inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , subtypes Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . It identify location chromosome responsible hereditary IBD linkage analysis , technique genetic research occurrence disorder family evaluate alongside know genetic disorder . The project also fine map gene examine possible gene associate IBD . IBD chronic often disable disorder gastrointestinal tract , affect 500,000 Americans . Both Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis share many characteristic , abdominal pain , bloody diarrhea , fever , fatigue , malnutrition . But main factor distinguish subtypes depend location depth inflammation . Tests analysis generally pinpoint difference two , sometimes major overlap characteristic , diagnosis know indeterminate IBD . The exact cause IBD know , genetic environmental factor know contribute risk disease . The single important environmental risk factor smoke exposure time diagnosis make . Also , several genetic risk factor ethnicity , family history , polymorphisms-abilities take different forms-in NOD2 gene . Patients diagnosis IBD family member 5 year age old diagnosis may eligible study . Participants ask complete questionnaire health , ethnic background , religion , habit , family medical history , medication . Information also seek diagnosis , course , complication , treatment IBD , well risk factor . In addition , collection blood use DNA preparation , storage lymphocyte , information immunology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Using epidemiological , statistical , molecular genetic technique , proposal design investigate existence genetic region believe confer risk inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , consist two subtypes , Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . The project derive study population , consist IBD physician confirm affected probands family member , Johns Hopkins University , University Chicago , University Pittsburgh . The project consist multiple part . The first part reanalysis exist genome wide linkage data IBD family 377 genotyped microsatellite marker data incorporates covariate data analysis , goal identify new refining previously identify region linkage . Eventually may extend include new family type genome wide scan marker . The second part project consist fine map IBD3 locus ( HLA region chromosome 6p ) , show evidence linkage UC patient . Fifty-two microsatellite marker span affected child trio effort identify potential marker allele may associate UC , use IBD3 locus genotyped study population consist 240 UC father-mother-affected child trio effort identify potential marker allele may associate UC , use transmission disequilibrium test , identify potential haplotype may confer increased risk develop UC , use likelihood-based approach move window adjacent marker test excessive transmission . Additional candidate gene within IBD3 examine , polymorphism also test potential significant association . Eventually second part may extend fine map association analysis candidate gene and/or candidate region .</detailed_description>
