	<brief_summary>We conduct interdisciplinary case-control/sib-pair study lung cancer design explore genetic determinant lung cancer smoking . The study include biospecimen collection well exposure information power address main genetic effect gene-environment interaction . This integrate proposal design address two major issue : genetic determinant lung cancer smoker genetic determinant smoking . Other important issue address study marginal additional cost main design . The study achieve excellent power study main effect genetic factor relatively common good power formal test interactive effect . Using case-control design , questionnaire , medical record abstraction , blood collection , investigate : main effect gene lung cancer risk ; gene-environment gene-gene effect lung cancer etiology ; gene effect smoke persistence ; gene effect ever-never smoke ; gene-psychological interaction smoke behavior . In addition , collect viable lymphocyte study subject tumor , metaplastic normal tissue sample 100 surgical case . With data tissue , able study : genetic instability lung cancer tissue relation specific exposure , genotype , persistence smoking , clinical presentation lung cancer ; histologic characteristic lung cancer relation genotype , gene expression , somatic mutation , smoking ; functional assay viable lmphocytes relation genotype , gene expression . Finally , identify lung cancer-affected sibling case , unaffected sibling sibships . This sample permit u : replicate association find case-control sample alternative analytical method base transmission statistic ; address population stratification issue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This interdisciplinary multicenter case-control study lung cancer situate Milan Italy , design explore genetic determinant lung cancer smoking . We enrol newly diagnose lung cancer case within defined area around Milan Italy , population-based control area . The study include biospecimen collection well epidemiological clinical data . This integrate proposal design address two major issue : genetic determinant lung cancer genetic determinant smoking . Other important issue arc address study marginal additional cost main design . The study achieve excellent power study main effect genetic factor relatively common good power formal test interactive eftects . Using case-control design , questionnaire , medical record abstraction , blood collection . investigate : - main effect gene lung cancer risk - gene-environment gene-gene effect lung cancer etiology - gene effect smoke persistence - gene effect ever-never smoke In addition , collect viable lymphocyte study subject tumor , metaplastic normal tissue sample least 400 surgical case . With data tissue , study : - genetic instability lung cancer tissue relation specific exposure , genotype , persistence smoking , clinical presentation lung cancer ; - histologic characteristic lung cancer relation genotype , gene expression , methylation . somatic mutation , smoking ; - functional assay viable lymphocyte relation genotype , gene expression Moreover . collect clinical report treatment , quality life , recurrence , toxicity , survival case consent . With material able link genetic profile case data therapy efficacy , toxicity survival , contribute improvement treatment lung cancer .</detailed_description>
