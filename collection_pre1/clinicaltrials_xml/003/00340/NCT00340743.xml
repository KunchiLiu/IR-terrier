	<brief_summary>This study examine risk protective effect dietary factor temporary genetic damage cell line gastrointestinal tract blood cell . Some food , include well do meat , may increase genetic damage cell , others , yogurt vegetable , may reduce genetic damage . This study may provide new information influence diet increase decrease risk develop cancer , particularly colorectal cancer . The study conduct General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) University North Carolina . Nonsmoking , English-speaking , healthy adult 18 45 year age may eligible 4-week study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Interview : Participants complete questionnaire include information diet , habit , past present health , family history . - Diet : Participants adhere strictly diet provide dietician GCRC 4 week study . All meal provide GCRC . All meal contain well-done meat contain yogurt , cruciferous vegetable , include broccoli cabbage , chlorophyllin tablet . Chlorophyllin compound food protect genetic damage . - Urine sampling : Participants collect urine sample morning except Saturday Sunday . - Stool sampling : Participants collect two stool sample study , one second week another fourth week . - Blood draw : About 2-1/2 tablespoon blood drawn week research purpose . The blood test effect eat food different diet use study . - Rectal biopsy : Four pinch biopsy , size grain rice , take rectum week research purpose . For procedure , forceps insert shallowly rectum collect tissue . The effect different diet colon cell measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer one common form cancer worldwide second lead cause cancer death United States . Given frequency occurrence poor prognosis many afflicted individual , prevention disease major public health priority past decade . However evidence epidemiological study yet explain tremendous excess risk develop country , trend tentatively attribute lifestyle dietary factor . In past year , consumption red meat particular , meat product , attract considerable attention epidemiological , clinical , experimental study , increase focus certain class compound find cooked meat , heterocyclic amine . Heterocyclic amines substance form pyrolysis amino acid creatine meat cook high temperature , particularly pan-frying . Heterocyclic amine level increase cook temperature , type shape cook piece meat , degree brown surface , cook method . In several epidemiological study , include study Harvard , International Agency Research Cancer ( IARC ) , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) , individual long-term exposure heterocyclic amine diet increase risk colorectal cancer colorectal adenoma , respectively . However , study heterocyclic amine human show positive association colorectal cancer risk , clear consensus regard association lack . Based implication epidemiological study , researcher NCI recently conduct series control feeding study aim relate short-term exposure heterocyclic amine fry meat consumption transient change urine mutagenicity level . These study provide evidence meat fry high temperature result significant short-term increase exposure mutagen . However , whereas urine mutagenicity appear good short-term measure exposure heterocyclic amine diet , unclear whether compound induce genetic damage colonic epithelial cell human . Against background , propose conduct feed study include examination colon tissue evidence transient DNA damage detect single cell gel electrophoresis ( comet ) assay follow experimental intake fry meat . This study provide direct evidence previous study whether genetic damage colon epithelium lymphocytes related dietary intake heterocyclic amine . The use comet assay detect effect diet transient DNA damage novel type control feeding study , particularly respect monitoring effect diet colon epithelial cell . We also monitor effect fry meat ingestion DNA damage lymphocytes detect change urinary mutagenicity relate dietary regimen .</detailed_description>
