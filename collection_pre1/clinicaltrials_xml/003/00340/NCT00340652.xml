	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Children 's Hospital Boston Brigham Women 's Hospital Boston , examine natural history infant development first year life different type infant feeding may affect development . During pregnancy , baby expose female hormone estrogen mother . Estrogen affect development breast milk production , well development uterus , ovaries possibly hormonally responsive organ male female . Between 6 12 month age , effect reduce . Breast milk infant formula may contain compound act like female hormone body may prolong estrogen effect . This study examine natural history estrogen activity infant different feed regimen , breast milk , cow 's milk , soy milk serve preparation large study effect soy formula estrogen activity infant . Full-term female baby ( 37 41 week gestational age birth ) 0 12 month age male baby birth 6 month age weigh 2501 4499 gram ( 5.5 10 pound ) birth chromosomal abnormality , major malformation , endocrine problem may eligible study . Males must palpable testis . Babies feed diet breast milk , soy milk , cow 's milk include . Study procedure include follow : - History baby 's dietary intake since birth , provide parent ; - Ultrasound measurement uterus , ovary , breast female baby ; testis , prostate , breast male ; thymus , thyroid , kidneys baby ; - Measurements baby ' weight , length , head circumference .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Term newborns anatomic sonographic evidence utero estrogen exposure . Over first six month year life , influence maternal hormone wane , finding recede . Soy infant formula contain large amount isoflavones ( daidzein genistein ) occupy estrogen receptor act estrogens laboratory . A food substance estrogen activity might prolong effect maternal hormone , interfere hormonal homeostasis child . This cross-sectional pilot study undertaken order establish method future multi center study design ass potential effect soy formula estrogen activity infant . In pilot study ( SEAD 1 ) , 156 examination full-term infant , age 0-12 month one three feeding regimen ( soy formula , breast milk cow 's milk formula ) complete see exposure soy estrogen compare breast milk non-soy formulas prolongs anatomical evidence estrogen exposure response . A schedule visit SEAD 1 include Appendix A . In addition SEAD 1 , two cross-sectional study ( SEAD 2 SEAD 3 ) undertaken evaluate anatomical evidence physical examination ( SEAD 2 ) ass hormonal biochemical status full-term infant age 0-12 month ( SEAD 3 ) . These study conduct Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) parallel SEAD 1 study . Further detail SEAD 2 3 present protocol . The purpose SEAD 1 pilot study twofold . The first develop finalize recruitment collection procedure preparation large , comprehensive trial biological response child soy formula without estrogenic isoflavones . The second study natural history estrogen activity infant variety feed regimen .</detailed_description>
