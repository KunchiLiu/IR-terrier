	<brief_summary>The Pima Indians Arizona high prevalence incidence type 2 diabetes population world . Prospective analysis population identify insulin resistance defect early insulin secretion risk factor development disease . A recent longitudinal analysis track development diabetes 17 Pima Indians demonstrate insulin action early insulin secretion deteriorate individual progress normal impaired glucose tolerance diabetes . These result suggest inherent ( apparent normal glucose tolerant subject progress diabetes likely genetic basis ) acquire ( evident individual progress NGT IGT diabetes possibly environmental origin ) defect insulin action secretion contribute pathogenesis type 2 diabetes . To identify genetic environmental determinant diabetes plan study Pima Indian family determine : ( 1 ) gene segregate metabolic risk factor diabetes might therefore genetic marker type 2 diabetes ( 2 ) mechanism mediate genetic environmental determinant insulin resistance impair insulin secretion . Volunteers study admitted clinical research ward undergo several test determine body composition , oral intravenous glucose tolerance vivo insulin action .
