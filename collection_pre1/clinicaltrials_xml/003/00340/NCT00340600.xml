In 1992 , Congress pass bill ( H ; .R . 4178 ) mandate continue follow-up DES-exposed cohort mother , daughter , son grandchildren . The National Cancer Institute , collaboration five field center , reassemble previously study cohort DES-exposed unexposed mother , daughter son , identify subject document exposure status study previously , familial link within cohort . Standardized baseline questionnaire mail cohort member ascertain risk cancer disorder . Pathology report collect report cancer preneoplastic condition . Three separate phase follow conduct . Patients Registry Research Hormonal Transplacental Carcinogenesis University Chicago add follow-up effort mail questionaire use third phase follow-up . A cohort daughter woman expose exposed DES utero add study assess effect DES third generation woman . The purpose study whole continue follow-up , mean mailed questionnaire medical record collection , begin first phase study . Concern arisen DES-exposed daughter may high risk breast cancer . Exposure high level endogenous estrogen utero hypothesize increase risk breast cancer DES potent estrogen . Cancer risk son also continue assess , especially increased risk prostate cancer . Since offspring expose DES utero currently reach late forty , cancer rate begin rise , important continue follow-up cohort determine long-term increase cancer risk . We plan add biospecimen collection component study . We propose conduct pilot study , nest within ongoing combine cohort DES-daughters , Boston University determine feasibility recruit woman participate study phlebotomy investigate potential difference hormone metabolites methylation pattern germline DNA 60 sample represent three group woman : expose high dos DES prenatally , expose low-doses DES prenatally , unexposed . Hormone metabolites DNA methylation assess relation DES exposure . Hormone metabolite measure NCI Frederick laboratory . DNA methylation assess Dr. Shuk-Mei Ho , Jacob G. Schmidlapp Chair Department Environmental Health , Director Center Environmental Genetics , Co-Leader Hormonal Malignancies Program Joint Cancer Center , College Medicine University Cincinnati , OH , Stephen Chanock laboratory NCI . The finding pilot study may profound implication mechanism endocrine disruption fetus influence human health . IRB approval data collection protocol receive Boston University .</detailed_description>
