	<brief_summary>The overall goal project identify strategy reduce lung cancer incidence mortality . Using high-risk occupational cohort , specific objective 1 ) establish biologic specimen bank data bank use validation refinement potential early marker lung cancer , 2 ) establish cohort study environmental ( include dietary ) genetic risk factor lung cancer . Lung cancer lead cause death malignant neoplasm United States many country around world . Potential strategy reduce incidence mortality lung cancer include new method early detection identification alteration etiologic factor . The Yunnan Tin Corporation ( YTC ) , locate Yunnan Province southern China , large , nonferrous-metals industry , formed 1883 nationalized establishment People 's Republic 1949 . It involve principally production tin mine around city Gejiu . The tin miner YTC extremely high rate lung cancer . Among high risk , define miner 40+ year old 10+ year underground mining and/or smelt experience , one percent per year develop lung cancer . These extraordinary lung cancer rate result combine exposure radon , arsenic , tobacco smoking form cigarettes and/or bamboo water pipe . The study population development biologic specimen bank study early marker lung cancer YTC miner consider high risk lung cancer base occupation exposure ( 40+ year old 10+ year underground smelt experience ) . Currently number 7,000 , high-risk group target annual lung cancer screen program YTC past 20+ year . For high-risk miner , sputum sample collect annually , read cytologic interpretation , store Saccomanno 's solution future early marker research . Screening chest x-ray also obtain . Subjects follow annually determine develop lung cancer . Diagnostic workup suspicious case include additional sputum sample histology specimen ( ) , use diagnostic purpose also retain future research . Additional biologic specimen also obtain screenees etiologic research , include one-time collection whole blood , urine , toenail clipping . Finger stick blood buccal smear DNA also seek .</brief_summary>
