	<brief_summary>Background : Over 80 % hemophiliac population become infected HIV prior 1985 also co-infected HCV . Thus , hemophiliacs represent important population study natural history chronic viral infection . Moreover , high rate co-infection make ideal group assess interaction virus relationship viral specific immune response clinical progression . Although hemophiliac poulation unique , co-infection chronic viral pathogen become increasingly common , particularly amongst intravenous drug user , account approximately 25 % HIV-1 epidemic United States . Objectives : The aim study determine polymorphism promoter region TH1 Th2 cytokine associate ( 1 ) intracellular cytokine level CD4 + Tcells , ( 2 ) Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) viral load , ( 3 ) clinical progression HIV1 AIDS hemophiliac . Eligibility : The current proposal investigate host genetic factor relate HIV-1 HCV immunopathogenesis study child adolescent enrol Hemophilia Growth Development Study ( HGDS ) .
