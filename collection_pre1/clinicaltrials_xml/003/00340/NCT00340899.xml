	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Gestational age 6 22 week first visit base patient last menstrual period report patient . High risk group : presence specific risk factor preterm delivery , pregnancyinduced hypertension intrauterine growth retardation . Low risk group : normal pregnancy risk factor preterm delivery , pregnancyinduced hypertension intrauterine growth retardation ( control population , select 6 22 week prenatal care clinic ) . The rationale include group 5070 % preterm delivery occur patient without risk factor preterm birth . Consent participate study . Patient able attend Perinatal Research Center prenatal care participation study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Preterm labor , preterm PROM , preeclampsia impair fetal growth time recruitment . Any maternal fetal condition require termination pregnancy . Known major fetal anomaly fetal demise . Active vaginal bleeding . Multifetal pregnancy great equal 3 fetus . Serious medical illness ( renal insufficiency , congestive heart disease , chronic respiratory insufficiency , etc ) . Severe chronic hypertension ( require medication ) . Asthma require systemic steroid . Patient require antiplatelet nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug . Active hepatitis . Lack consent .</criteria>
