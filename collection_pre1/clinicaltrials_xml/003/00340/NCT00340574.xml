	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety efficacy experimental malaria vaccine AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® ( Registered Trademark ) determine whether new , additional component vaccine may increase effectiveness . Malaria debilitate potentially fatal blood disease transmit parasite find certain mosquito . The AMA1-C1 vaccine design create immune response parasite prevent disease . The purpose study determine whether additional component-protein piece know CpG- improves immune response vaccine without cause problematic side effect . Volunteers must healthy adult 18 45 year old . Individuals malaria past recently travel area malaria endemic exclude study . Candidates screen physical examination , blood test , medical history . Participants involve three-stage study . In first stage , group participant receive either high dose vaccine alone low dose combine CpG protein . In second stage , different group participant receive high dose vaccine alone high dose combine CpG . In third stage , large group participant receive high dose vaccine alone high dose combine CpG . The vaccine inject muscle upper arm , participant receive three dos vaccine 28 day dos monitor possible reaction side effect . Participants monitor 30 minute injection record symptom experience six day receive dose . In addition , participant examine course six month trial physical exam blood urine test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : This study evaluate safety immunogenicity experimental malaria vaccine AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® ( Registered Trademark ) , ability TLR-9 agonist CPG 7909 oligodexoynucleotide ( ODN ) augment antibody response vaccine alter Th1/Th2 bias . The vaccine preparation study contain equal mixture AMA1 two different clone Plasmodium falciparum ( FVO 3D7 ) , produce separately recombinant protein express Pichia pastoris ( PpAMA-1 FVO PpAMA-1 3D7 ) . Bulk PpAMA-1 antigen purified culture medium transform yeast grown 60L fermenter . The correctly fold PpAMA-1 purified mixture combination affinity , ionic , hydrophobic gel filtration chromatography . Purified PpAMA-1 FVO PpAMA-1 3D7 subsequently mixed adsorb onto aluminum hydroxide gel ( Alhydrogel® ( Registered Trademark ) ) . The CPG 7909 ODN formulation use study ( CPG 7909 ) manufacture Coley Pharmaceutical Group . Subjects randomly assign receive Alhydrogel® ( Registered Trademark ) formulate vaccine without CPG 7909 point use formulation . Research Environment : The study conduct University Rochester Vaccine Treatment Evaluation Unit ( VTEU ) . Subjects : Subjects study healthy adult age 18 45 year history malaria recent travel malaria-endemic area . Subjects enrol three consecutive dose-escalation cohort review Safety Monitoring Committee cohort . Subject participation : Subjects receive three vaccination AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® ( Registered Trademark ) vaccine formulate Alhydrogel® ( Registered Trademark ) without CPG 7909 adjuvant 2 month ( 0 , 1 , 2 month ) intramuscular ( IM ) injection . Subjects multiple blood sample obtain next 6 month . Variables Investigated : Samples test bind antibody AMA1 ability inhibit growth plasmodium vitro . In addition , antigen-specific activate B cell peripheral blood enumerate , well relative ratio antigen-specific Th1-like Th2-like T cell . Risk/Benefits : The risk participate study associate administration AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® ( Registered Trademark ) CPG 7909 , include local pain , systemic inflammatory response include fever influenza-like symptom , induction autoimmune response . As investigational vaccine , unknown risk . Subjects may derive benefit participation study . Development effective vaccine prevent malaria important societal benefit . Confidentiality : Volunteers code number identify name .</detailed_description>
