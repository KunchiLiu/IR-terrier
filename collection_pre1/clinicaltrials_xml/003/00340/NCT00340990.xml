	<brief_summary>This study , conduct University Mali capital city Bamako , investigate body reacts infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) , organism cause tuberculosis . Tuberculosis major global health problem whose solution require development effective vaccine . However , incomplete understand immunity MTB acquire measure limit vaccine development . This study focus certain immune system cell - CD4+ T cell - appear important fighting tuberculosis . Individuals 16 year age old expose either tuberculosis HIV , , may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test , review medical record laboratory test , , medically indicate , chest x-ray . Individuals whose medical record indicate past history tuberculosis positive test exposure tuberculosis tuberculin skin test . For test , drop fluid place skin see immune system react substance , indicate previous exposure MTB . Participants come University Mali 10 time 1-year period - 7 time within first 3 month study every 3 month 1 year enrollment . At study visit , ask medical history donate 75 milliliter ( 1/3 cup ) blood , total 830 mL entire year . More blood may request participant 's immune system react strongly MTB laboratory test . No 450 mL ( 2 cup ) blood would collect every 6 week ; amount Red Cross limit regular blood donation every 6 week . The blood sample use test measure level immunity tuberculosis . Genetic test may perform blood cell help interpret special test immunity . Because HIV-infected people include study , finding may also provide information HIV render vulnerability opportunistic infection , include tuberculosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis daunt global health problem . The solution require development effective vaccine . But incomplete understanding Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( MTB ) immunity-how acquire , measured-limits vaccine development empiric rather rational approach . New perspective need . Most individual infect MTB never actually develop active tuberculosis . Similarly , individual treat tuberculosis BCG vaccination also protect subsequent disease . These individual may say immune . One approach obtain great understand MTB immunity study individual discover mechanisms immunity mediate protection disease . Because already know CD4+ T cell critical component MTB immunity , study CD4+ T cell response MTB infection immune individual reasonable start point . To determine CD4+ T cell subset CD4+ T cell immune response important , compare individual prior exposure ( immunity ) MTB individual active tuberculosis . Because HIV infection interfere CD4+ T cell response MTB , dramatically increase risk acquire MTB infection develop disease . Under circumstance easy discern mechanism relevant MTB immunity exaggerate MTB-specific response . In study aim identify CD4+ T cell subset responses correlate MTB immunity . We anticipate correlation yield new insight mechanism MTB immunity relevant vaccine development . In addition , examine MTB immunity set HIV coinfection , anticipate new insight mechanisms HIV cause disease .</detailed_description>

CATEGORYSPECIFIC MTB INCLUSION CRITERIA : Group A ( HIV/MTB [ BCG ] ) HIV ELISA ( 2 ) negative ; BCG vaccinate TST ( 2 ) less 15 mm Group B ( HIV+/MTB [ BCG ] ) HIV ELISA/WB ( 2 ) positive ; BCG vaccinate TST le 5 mm Group C ( HIV/MTB [ pulm ] ) HIV ELISA negative ; pulmonary MTB Group D ( HIV/MTB [ diss ] ) HIV ELISA negative ; disseminate MTB Group E ( HIV+/MTB [ pulm ] ) HIV ELISA/WB positive ; pulmonary MTB Group F ( HIV+/MTB [ diss ] ) HIV ELISA/WB positive ; disseminate MTB EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Age le 18 year ( risk induce protocolrelated anemia ) Hg le 7.5 g/dL Latent MTB infection ( evidence TST great 5 mm HIV infect great 15 mm HIV uninfected ) arm A B . Past history treat MTB infection Known underlie bleed disorder ( due risk bleed venipuncture ) Psychiatric illness might interfere study compliance Use immunomodulators ( include corticosteroid IL2 ) cytotoxic agent ( include hydroxyurea ) within 45 day sign consent time study Small difficult access antecubital vein make venipuncture difficult</criteria>
