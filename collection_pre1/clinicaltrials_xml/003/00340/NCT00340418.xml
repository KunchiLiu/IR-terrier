	<brief_summary>This study explore way lung transplant reject . A series experiment evaluate difference airway gene expression . Lung transplantation become important option patient advance lung disease . More 10,000 patient received date , 1,200 transplant operation perform worldwide year . Although short-term survival continue improve , 5-year survival rate le 50 % . Most posttransplant death directly directly cause chronic lung rejection , condition scar worsens lung function . . Patients age 18 old receive lung transplant , undergo bronchoscopy part usual care transplant , pregnant may eligible study . Bronchoscopy procedure perform study do doctor special train . They take total 30 60 minute . During bronchoscopy , patient lie flat bed . They awake follow instruction . First breathe Xylocaine ( lidocaine ) , anesthetic mist , 8 10 minute . That lessen discomfort small flexible tube call bronchoscope guide back patient 's mouth nose breathe tube . When flexible tube place , patient able speak . They receive medication Versed ( midazolam ) , make relaxed remember procedure , fentanyl , decrease possibility feeling pain . These medication give narrow tube feed small needle place vein arm . The risk tube place vein include bleed , swell , redness , pain . Side effect medication may include stomach upset , heart palpitation ( awareness heartbeat ) , change blood pressure . Patients carefully monitor heart rate , blood pressure , breathing , oxygen level . During bronchoscopy , procedure call bronchoalveolar lavage do , small amount germ-free salt water inject bronchoscope lung immediately suction back , thus wash line airway check infection rejection transplant lung . About 1 2 tablespoon fluid collect analysis . Also , endobronchial brush biopsy may perform . A small brush remove cell surface airway . These cell send laboratory Duke University Health system analyze signal cell may eventually lead scar chronic rejection lung . Then , endobronchial forceps biopsy perform , one two small piece , size grain rice , line lung 's large airway remove . A small surgical tool like tweezer pass lung . Risks biopsy may include bleeding , injury lung , air leak lung . This study direct benefit participant . However , hop information gather enhance researcher ' understand lung rejection occur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Lung Allograft Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung transplantation emerge viable therapeutic option care patient advance pulmonary parenchymal pulmonary vascular disease . Currently , 10,000 patient receive lung transplantation approximately 1200 transplant operation perform worldwide year . Short term survival lung transplantation continue improve since widespread application procedure one-year survival center approach 80 % . Unfortunately , long-term outcome lung transplantation disappoint five-year survival 50 % . Most posttransplant death due directly indirectly development chronic allograft rejection , affect approximately 50 % five-year survivor . Acute rejection major risk factor development chronic rejection . Chronic lung rejection lead condition irreversible fibrosis obliteration small medium size bronchiole know obliterative bronchiolitis ( OB ) . Very little know pathogenic mechanism lead development OB . Furthermore , unclear acute rejection lead development chronic rejection patient . In order well understand mechanism OB propose series experiment design evaluate difference airway gene expression series lung transplant recipient without acute rejection .</detailed_description>
