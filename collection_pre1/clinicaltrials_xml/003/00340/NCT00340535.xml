	<brief_summary>This study examine whether genetic difference among individual affect blood level certain chemical call DBPs showering . Chemicals chlorine ozone use kill germ water . These chemical may react organic matter water form chemical call disinfection byproduct , DBPs . Although people usually expose DBPs drink tap water , chemical may also penetrate body shower . This study see whether level DBPs shower vary among individual depend difference gene code enzyme call GSTT1 , CYP2D6 , CYP2E1 , break DBPs . This study , sponsor Centers Disease Control Prevention National Institutes Health , conduct University Pittsburgh 's Center Clinical Pharmacology . Healthy adults 18 45 year age smoke cigarettes take medicine may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history blood urine test . Participants give diary record foods eat much water drink 2 day study appointment . The following activity schedule appointment day : - Measurements blood pressure , height , weight , pregnancy test woman - Questions alcohol consume medication take last 48 hour - Review food water diary - Interview demographic information ( name , address , date birth , etc . ) information , sex , height , weight . Subjects also ask anything , exercise , might affect breathing , since breathe problem rare side effect chlorzoxazone , drug use study . - Urine sample collection - Blood draw insertion small catheter ( plastic tube ) allow additional blood draws test procedure without repeat needle stick - 10-minute shower private bathroom - Blood sample collection 10 minute shower 30 minute shower - Dose chlorzoxazone ( drug use treat muscle pain ) - Interview subject 's exposure water - Light breakfast - Blood urine collection 2 hour chlorzoxazone dose - Lunch - Observation drug side effect 2 hour , longer need Seven blood sample total 75 milliliter ( 5 tablespoonful ) blood collect study . The blood test chemical call trihalomethanes see break . The urine sample test chemical call haloacetic acid , find tap water treat chlorine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Genetic Differences Levels Water Disinfection Byproducts Blood After Showering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Disinfection byproduct drink water ( DBP ) inadvertently create chlorine interact organic compound untreated water . DBP implicate elevate risk several type cancer . Until recently , ingestion consider major route exposure . However , NCI collaborative study Spain show link bladder cancer exposure DBP water shower bathing . However , little known mechanism action . Almost drinking water disinfect chlorine contains measurable level DBP . The DBP find great concentration trihalomethanes [ ( THM ) ; chloroform , bromoform , bromodichloromethane , dibromochloromethane ] . Previously , collaborator CDC measure change blood THM level shower bathing , ingest water . Showering result large increase , wide range increase among subject similar exposure . Enzyme variant due genetic polymorphism may responsible difference . We plan assess association presence enzyme variant ( genetic polymorphism ) increase trihalomethanes blood people expose DBP showering . The study conduct General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) , Center Clinical Pharmacology ( CCP ) , University Pittsburgh , Dr. Robert Branch , Director . Approximately 250 volunteer identify Dr . Branch 's ongoing research program . These subject pre-screened normal standard blood panel genetic polymorphisms interest . From pool pre-screened individual , recruit approximately 100 people enzyme variant differ activity . We ask 100 volunteer provide seven 10-mL blood sample two urine sample , take 10-minute shower study site ( CCP Pittsburgh , PA ) . Blood sample analyze trihalomethane concentration , red blood cell enzyme activity . To study activity enzyme CYP2E1 , administer single dose chlorzoxazone , muscle relaxant metabolize enzyme . We measure enzyme activity analyze blood sample collect 2 hour post-administration . We conduct brief interview volunteer obtain demographic information might impact dose THM . We collect ambient air sample , shower participant analyze level THMs . A water sample collect shower analyzed level THM haloacetic acid . We ask 10 randomly select study subject repeat study activity quality control purpose . Levels THM blood showering , rate decrease blood concentration , analyzed respect presence genetic polymorphism select enzymes , phenotypic activity . Blood THM level also compare various demographic physiologic measurement . To test intra-individual variation several measure , ten randomly select participant ( stratified sex , i.e . 5 male 5 female ) ask conduct study twice , two study appointment separate least week .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The study population comprise nonsmoking male female age range 1845 year . The age range select limit variability activity important enzyme system . EXCLUSIONS CRITERIA : Persons lung condition exclude inhalation major route exposure trihalomethanes . Liver condition exclude potential risk possibly associate chlorzoxazone administration . Pregnant lactate woman exclude participation study , multiple reason , major one possible ( unknown ) adverse health risk chlorzoxazone exposure . In addition , exclude person chronic condition diabetes chronically use medication , Orinase others . These person exclude due unknown effect disease enzyme system investigation avoid possible adverse effect study , include chlorzoxazone administration .</criteria>
