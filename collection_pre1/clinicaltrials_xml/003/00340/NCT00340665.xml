	<brief_summary>This study , conduct University Pennsylvania Newborn Nursery , Children Hospital Philadelphia , Exton Specialty Care Center , examine different infant diet may affect estrogen activity baby . During pregnancy , baby expose female hormone estrogen mother . Estrogen play key role development breast milk production , well development uterus . The effect hormones see baby examine . Between 6 12 month age , effect reduce . Breast milk infant formula may contain compound act like female hormone body may prolong estrogen effect . This study two part . Part 1 study physical development baby feed different way . Part 2 study hormone level baby differ depend fed . Babies may participate one part . Part 1 include baby 0 6 month age ; part 2 include baby 0 12 month age . In part study , parent may choose baby evaluate one four time . Full-term infant ( age 37 41 week gestational age ) birth 12 month age weigh 2501 4499 gram ( 5.5 10 pound ) birth chromosomal abnormality , major malformation , endocrine problem may eligible study . Male infant must palpable testis . Infants feed diet breast milk , soy milk , cow milk include . Study procedure include follow : Part 1 - Feeding history : parent provide information baby dietary intake since birth . - Length , weight , head circumference : baby measurement take . - Physical examination : baby physical maturity assess examination skin , breast , external sex organ . - Breast secretion : baby breast bud gently press physical examination look milky-white substance baby produce first year life . If substance appear , specimen collect . - Vaginal cell : baby girl , open vaginal area gently swab sterile Q-tip ass maturity vaginal lining . Part 2 - Feeding history length , weight head circumference measurement describe . - Urine : urine sample collect cotton diaper urine collection bag . - aliva : saliva sample collect gently swab inside baby mouth 1 hour morning feeding remove leave milk . - Hair : lock hair , 1/2-inch wide 1 2 inch long take 12-month old baby . - Blood : infant small blood sample collect heel-stick . This study serve basis later study infant formula affect infant growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Term newborns anatomic sonographic evidence utero estrogen exposure . Over first six month year life , influence maternal hormone wane , finding recede . Soy infant formula contain large amount isoflavones ( diadzein genistein ) occupy estrogen receptor act estrogens laboratory . A food substance estrogen activity might prolong effect maternal hormone , interfere hormonal homeostasis child . Two cross-sectional pilot study ( SEAD 2 SEAD 3 ) undertaken order establish method future , multi-center study design ass potential effect soy formula estrogen activity infant . Another cross-sectional pilot study ( SEAD 1 ) undertaken evaluate anatomical evidence detect ultrasound conduct The Children 's Hospital Boston . Details SEAD 1 study present protocol . In first pilot study ( SEAD 2 ) , 84 examination full-term infant , age 0-6 month one three feeding regimen ( soy formula , breast milk cow 's milk formula ) conduct . This study establish protocol examine sample method use later trial investigate whether exposure soy estrogen compare breast milk non-soy formulas prolongs anatomical evidence estrogen exposure response . In addition physical examination , vaginal cell collect cytology analysis . Breast nipple secretion , present , also collect analyzed protein sugar level . In second pilot study ( SEAD 3 ) , 372 evaluation full-term infant conduct parallel first study . SEAD 3 assess hormonal biochemical status full-term infant age 0-12 month . This study establish protocol sample method use collect urine , saliva , serum , hair sample . Endogenous hormone level testosterone , estradiol , isoflavone level ( genestein diadzein ) measure serum result compare non-serum test ( urine , saliva hair ) . The purpose two pilot study twofold . The first develop finalize recruitment collection procedure preparation large , comprehensive trial biological response child soy formula without estrogenic isoflavones . The second study natural history estrogen activity infant variety feed regimen .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : SEAD 2 3 1 . Full term infant define age 3741 week gestational age birth . Ultrasound evidence reliable reporting last menstrual period ( LMP ) infant 's mother . 2 . Can categorize one feed definition . 3 . Birth weight 25014499 gram . 4 . Age 06 month SEAD 2 , age 012 month SEAD 3 5 . For SEAD 3 , 12months age interval , subject must first haircut . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : SEAD 2 3 1 . Chromosomal aberration 2 . Major malformation 3 . SEAD 2 : Nonpalpable testis ( male ) 4 . Presence endocrinopathy ( i.e. , ambiguous genitalia , congenital hypothyroidism ) This natural history study child must healthy order participate study . Therefore , child exclude study know chromosomal aberration , major malformation endocrinopathy . Testicular development important endpoint study therefore male exclude SEAD 2 testis palpable .</criteria>
