	<detailed_description>The Division Cancer Prevention Control ( DCP , formerly DCPC ) , extramural contract 10 U.S. clinical center , evaluate effectiveness screen prostate , lung , colorectal ovarian cancer ( The PLCO Trial ) . In 1996 NCI Executive Committee approve expansion PLCO Trial collect additional material conduct additional study . About 74,000 men 74,000 woman , age 55-74 year , randomize 50/50 basis screen usual care arm . Additional blood collect screened subject saliva buccal cell control subject . Pathologic tissue obtain case develop cancer select related disease ( e.g. , colon polyp , benign prostatic hyperplasia ) . Additional questionnaire-based risk disease-related information also collect , confirmation disease status medical record . Genetic , biochemical questionnaire-based risk information relate development cancer diseases population . Volunteers provide sample study routinely receive individual result Additional Investigation . Subjects request information , however , provide research result . In 2009 NCI Executive Committee approve Extended Follow-up subject beyond original 13-year follow-up period . Participants reconsented release record single NCI-Designated Central Data Collection Center ( CDCC ) , administer annual mailing contain annual study update questionnaire brief ( 1-2 page ) risk factor questionnaire . Individuals consent release identifier CDCC follow passively linkage state cancer registry National Death Index . This protocol Review Application ( 1 ) collaboration intramural scientist Division Cancer Epidemiology Genetics ( DCEG ) Additional Studies ( 2 ) coordination , collaboration DCP , Extended Follow-up .</detailed_description>
