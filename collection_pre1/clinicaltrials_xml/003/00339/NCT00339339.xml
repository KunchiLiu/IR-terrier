	<brief_summary>This study determine whether placement composite ( white ) dental restoration ( filling ) increase concentration bisphenol A ( BPA ) metabolites saliva urine . These compound estrogenic-like property raise concern safety . Small amount chemical leach dental sealant detect saliva soon sealant apply . Dental composite also contain compound . U.S . Commissioned Corps officer need filling part regular dental treatment select composite ( white ) restoration instead amalgam ( metal ) may include protocol . Participants recruit among officer receive dental care commission officer dental clinic Rockville , Md . Participants complete 15-minute interview gather information recent diet eating pattern . They also provide 3 4 urine saliva sample , collect dental restoration treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Levels Bisphenol A Urine Saliva Following Placement Composite Restorations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A study Olea et al 1996 report quantity specific estrogenic compound , Bisphenol A ( BPA ) , bis-glycidyl methacrylate ( bis-GMA ) Bis-A-dimethacrylate ( bis-DMA ) saliva associate placement certain dental sealant . This report raise concern regard safety dental sealant composite restoration . In subsequent study bis-GMA find stable , bis-DMA show hydrolyze BPA , likely account BPA detect extract certain sealant . Another study report detectable amount triethylene glycol dimethacrylate ( TEGDMA ) BPA diglycidyl ether ( BADGE ) release sealant saliva . All compound show deleterious effect specific endpoint vitro various endocrine disruptive effect animal model , although result consistent across animal strain , mode administration , diet unknown factor . Detectable level plasma show . Since insufficient data leachability concentration body fluid compound associate composite filling human important determine whether detectable level compound associate placement composite restoration , , whether level sufficiently maximum acceptable reference dose establish EPA . For bisphenol A maximum acceptable dose 0.05 milligram per kilogram body weight per day ( US EPA , 1993 ) . The National Institute Dental Craniofacial Research , National Toxicology Program National Institute Environmental Health Sciences , Commissioned Officers Dental Clinic Dentists unique opportunity conduct collaborative investigation Commissioned Officers Dental Clinic ( CODC ) Rockville , MD involve commission officer need dental restoration . This study determine whether placement composite restoration associate presence compound saliva . This particularly timely since number composite restoration place dentist practice U.S rapidly increase 80 million composite restoration place 1999 ( ADA , 2001 ) . It relevance U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Officers Dental Clinic ( CODC ) CODC place composite material dental clinic want ensure commissioned officer receive best safe possible dental care .</detailed_description>
