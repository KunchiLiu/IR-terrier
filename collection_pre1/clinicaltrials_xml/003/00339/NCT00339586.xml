	<brief_summary>Current chemotherapy advance non-small cell lung cancer , amenable curative local treatment ( surgery chemoradiotherapy ) , modest life-prolonging effect improve quality life . There however potential long-term cure patient . Chemotherapy also produce variable often significant toxicity . Current retrospective evidence suggest significant clinical response obtain patient whose cancer cell EGFR TKD mutation treat EGFR TKI . The ease administration toxicity profile TKI compare favourably chemotherapy , even single agent example gemcitabine The present study establish clinical benefit rate TKI first line treatment patient EGFR mutation thus estimate proportion patient might benefit prolonged period treatment modest toxicity profile .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>First-Line EGFR-1 Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Patients With NSCLC With Mutant EGFR Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients stage IV NSCLC patient advance locoregional disease ( stage III ) general incurable low probability long-term survival . Current systemic treatment good PS patient ( PS 0-1 ) consist cisplatin doublet ( e.g . cisplatin plus second drug : vinorelbine , gemcitabine , paclitaxel , docetaxel ) . The median one year survival obtain treatment range 8-10 month 25 - 35 % respectively ( 1,2 ) . Progression-free survival median 5 month less randomized study ( 3 ) . Response rate obtain less 25 % metastatic disease 75 % advanced locoregional disease . Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( RTKI 's ) active drug patient NSCLC pre-treated cisplatin and/or docetaxel contain chemotherapy ( 2,4 ) . Recently show EGFR1 kinase inhibitor erlotinib add best supportive care ( BSC ) prolong survival compare BSC alone patient advance NSCLC fail 1st 2nd line chemotherapy ( 5 ) . A small number preliminary report indicate objective response rate RTKI 's first line treatment patient population advance NSCLC could around 20 % ( 6 ) , The objective ( mainly partial ) response phase II study pre-treated patient range 10 - 15 % accord level pre-treatment control disease ( stable disease ) improvement symptom without demonstrated objective response report high 40 50 % ( 2,4 ) . The addition RTKI 's placebo current standard doublet ( e.g . cisplatin , gemcitabine taxol/carboplatin ) show impact response rate , time treatment failure survival large phase III randomise trial advance NSCLC patient select EGFR expression ( 7,8 ) . Recently , mutation intracellular EGFR kinase domain increase sensitivity receptor RTKI 's discover ( 9,10 ) . These study suggest response/resistance treatment could strongly correlate presence/absence mutation . It presently unclear whether patient achieve stable disease RTKI treatment receptor mutation , nature mutation could biological pathway modulate responsiveness/resistance . Mutations observe 10 % less tumours examine . Most mutation EGFR kinase domain find adenocarcinoma non-smokers minimal smoker . Recent data establish EGFR mutation find 30 % adenocarcinoma lung smoke history maximally 15 year . The probability find mutation approximately 50 % never-smokers adenocarcinoma ( 11 ) . In contrast rather low objective response rate , clinical benefit rate treatment RTKI around 40 % general population non-small lung cancer ( 9,10 ) , account mutational analysis . EGFR gene amplification might another determinant sensitivity , biological factor lead disease stabilisation patient non-activated EGFR presently unknown . Several humanized monoclonal antibody ( huMoAb ) inhibit EGFR-1 receptor develop well . Of , cetuximab ( ErbituxÒ ) develop extensively , especially head neck ( 12 ) colorectal cancer ( 13,14 ) , , fully humanize antibody ( huMoAb ) ( ABX-EGF , EMD 72000 ) development . Cetuximab assess NSCLC , especially combination first-line second-line chemotherapy ( 15 ) , data currently available respect single agent activity . The two type currently available drug target EGFR-1 , RTKI 's gefitinib erlotinib huMoAb cetuximab ABX-EGF , generally well tolerate devoid significant grade 3-4 toxicity . While strong indication major response obtain RTKI ’ could strongly correlate presence tyrosine kinase domain mutation addition know mechanism action drug ( 16,17 ) , present yet clear monoclonal antibody direct extracellular domain receptor . Some recent data suggest EGFR gene amplification might also correlate response TKI ( 18 ) . Patients Stage IV advance stage III NSCLC present incurable first-line chemotherapy palliative life prolong effect cost variable toxicity . On hand response rate TKI patient NSCLC carry mutant receptor probably high infer comparison prevalence mutation response rate agent unselected population ( 16 ) . It seem therefore reasonable explore first-line set potential EGFR-1 target therapy , drug favourable toxicity profile might induce prolonged palliation . There currently data would suggest delay chemotherapy patient population well control condition limited time period ( sufficient evaluate efficacy novel first-line treatment ) might affect efficacy subsequent chemotherapy . There also data suggest prior administration drug target EGFR-1 induce resistance subsequent chemotherapy . The distinct respective mechanism action drug chemotherapy also suggest likely . In disease prostate cancer oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer , availability hormonal treatment permit prolonged time long-term disease control limit discomfort . It possible similar scenario could obtain anti-EGFR treatment NSCLC carry mutant EGFR . Therefore seem justified expand previous second-line phase II experience anti-EGFR strategy patient incurable stage III-IV NSCLC without prior therapy mutant EGFR . The informed consent towards patient entry study clearly state first-line standard care chemotherapy , lead small overall survival benefit compare supportive treatment participation current study delay treatment within tightly control setting . In current trial RTKI erlotinib use . Prior experience drug obtain phase II III study . In phase II setting , unselected pretreated population , response rate 12.3 % median survival 8.4 month could obtain ( 19 ) . In phase III , placebo-controlled study , combination erlotinib concurrent chemotherapy provide survival advantage ( gemcitabine cisplatin TALENT ( 20 ) paclitaxel carboplatin TRIBUTE ( 21 ) . Several hypothesis explain result : lack selection patient ; antagonism cytostatic cytotoxic agent ( negative interaction chemotherapy give concurrently ) ; chemotherapy EGFR inhibitor target cell population since chemotherapy directly indirectly affect EGFR function/expression thereby reduce effect EGFR inhibitor . These result contrast significant survival benefit see phase III randomize placebo-controlled study NSCLC follow failure 1st 2nd line chemotherapy ( BR21 ) . The response rate 9 % erlotinib treat patient , significant increase progression free survival ( 8 9,7 wks ) increase survival ( 4.7 mth 6.7 mth , p &lt; 0.001 ) . In study biological parameter correlate response ( mutation status , EGFR gene amplification EGFR immunohistochemistry ) still study . Survival benefit correlate best presence EGFR expression immunohistochemistry EGFR gene polysomy ( 22 ) .</detailed_description>
