	<brief_summary>This study , conduct collaboration Johns Hopkins University School Medicine , explore genetic influence susceptibility atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) . Atherosclerosis chronic narrowing artery cause incremental buildup fatty substance lining wall artery . This study examine role gene related inflammatory process incidence ASCVD level chemokines ( protein involve inflammation ) . DNA sample , chemokines level relevant clinical data patient enrol Johns Hopkins 's sibling family heart study analyze specific gene marker . The study include : Nurse Model Black Families Risk Heart Disease ; Genotypic Determinants Aspirin Response High Risk Families ; Coronary Disease Detection Thallium SPECT Fast CT. All enrol patient consent DNA use test genetic factor may predict cardiovascular disease contain patient identifier information .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Atherosclerosis chronic inflammatory disease classically trigger hypertension , diabetes , smoke elevate cholesterol . It hypothesize genetic predisposition play crucial role individual 's susceptibility risk factor Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) identify functional mediator key inflammatory gene . Objectives : To determine frequency haplotype SNP combination proximal promoter region MCP-1 , MCP-3 gene , eotaxin gene patient risk factor CVD sibling . To determine MCP-1 level affect population Coronary artery disease sibling certain haplotype determine functional association MCP-1 level haplotype frequency . Eligibility : Eligibility criterion enrollment sib family study include : 1 ) sib 1st degree family member heart disease , 2 ) ability give inform consent participate study , 3 ) age 18 year old , 4 ) ability speak English Spanish . The entire set 2,000 sample available LDG analyze . No subject exclude . Design : DNAs derive properly consent subject enrol three protocol sponsor Johns Hopkins Heart Study send LGD use test specific marker MCP-1 , MCP-3 , eotaxin chemokine family locate C-C chemokine cluster chromosome17q11.2 . A minimum 11 SNPs examine . Sib-pair analysis utilized identify associate marker . Linear regression use analyze association genetic variation chemokine level . Haplotype assign unrelated individual use maximum likelihood approach . The DNA sample , chemokine level , relevant clinical data provide John Hopkins University School Medicine cod link . Following study , DNAs maintain repository curated central Laboratory database . Loss destruction sample annotate database impact study participant way . We understand study subsequent completion protocol require additional OHSR/IRB approval prior commencement .</detailed_description>
