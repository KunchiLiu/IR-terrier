	<brief_summary>This study continue follow-up patient systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) control subject enrol Carolina Lupus Study University North Carolina ( UNC ) Lupus Nephritis Study . SLE severe , chronic , disable autoimmune disease significantly affect health quality life . The disease often affect young middle-aged adult , therefore also affect work disability . There currently little information work-related disability relate SLE . The goal current study : - Determine health work status patient control Carolina Lupus Study UNC Lupus Nephritis Study ; - Develop test method obtain disease data university- community-based physician study area ; - Examine association sociodemographic , work-related factor , disease damage , work disability among SLE patient control ; - Assess role demographic socioeconomic factor , psychosocial attribute , potentially modifiable behavior environmental factor ( e.g. , smoking , occupational exposure , medication compliance ) disease damage measure , increase severity disease among African-American patient . Patients control subject enrol Carolina Lupus Study University North Carolina Lupus Nephritis Study eligible protocol .

	<detailed_description>Systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) severe , chronic , disable autoimmune disease significantly affect health status quality life . Since disease occurs often young middle-aged adult , SLE also affect work disability . However , currently little information work-related disability longitudinal , population-based study SLE . The Carolina Lupus Study large ( 265 case , 355 control ) case-control study SLE eastern North Carolina South Carolina .

Funding propose follow-up provide The National Institute Arthritis Musculoskeletal Diseases ( NIAMS ) , NIH Multidisciplinary Clinical Research Center Rheumatologic Diseases African Americans ( Project C - Genetic environmental influence development progression lupus nephritis ) . Patient contact follow introductory letter describes propose follow-up study interview plan begin late 2003 . This letter provide participant opportunity ( via toll-free phone number ) decline contact study . The 30-minute telephone interview cover hospitalization , current health status , work disability issue , change exposure since 2001 follow-up interview .
