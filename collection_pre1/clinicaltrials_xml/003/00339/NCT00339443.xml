	<brief_summary>We propose conduct pilot study among 30 volunteer Division Cancer Epidemiology Genetics ( DCEG ) order : ( 1 ) select urine pH strip closely correlate urine pH measure pH meter New England Bladder Cancer Study , ( 2 ) calibrate urine pH strip use Spanish Bladder Cancer Study pH measure pH meter , ( 3 ) compare DNA yield buccal cell obtain two different method : mouthwash v toothbrush-rinse method . Information collect pilot study use select optimize sample collection protocols New England Bladder Cancer Study . At time enrollment , study participant ask provide information age , gender , height , weight , consumption antacid calcium supplement , whether ate , drank brush teeth last hour previous buccal cell ample collection . In addition , measure urine pH four different pH strip twice day ( early morning dinner ) week record measurement diary . During week , ask collect two spot urine sample day Monday Thursday ( early morning dinner ) , one Friday morning , bring work cooler . Also , ask collect continuous 24-hour urine sample one three first day week . Urine sample e pick lab personnel BioReliance , pH measure laboratory four pH strip pH meter . Buccal cell sample collection complete first last day urine sample collection period . The first day , study participant ask provide water rinse sample brush inside cheek toothbrush , week later ask provide mouth wash sample consist two consecutive rinse Scope mouthwash . All sample questionnaire data unlinked personal identifier sample collection complete . Participants compensate $ 100 inconvenience participate complex study time .</brief_summary>
