	<brief_summary>Iodine-131 ( 131I ) radioisotope Iodine contain fallout atmospheric nuclear weapon test among radionuclides likely release nuclear reactor accident . In spite nearly 50 year experience , risk thyroid disease , especially thyroid cancer , attributable exposure 131I remains unknown , although carcinogenic potential x-ray gamma-ray exposure thyroid reasonably well know . The available data also indicate child face great risk radiation-induced thyroid cancer adult . The nuclear power plant accident Chernobyl release large quantity 131I radioisotope iodine atmosphere , contaminate thousand square kilometer expose million people . It propose well-defined subset Belarussian child age 0-18 year time accident examine well-trained specialist thyroid disease least biennially 30 year . A cohort 15,000 child identify , thyroid measure radioactivity week immediately follow accident . Under rigid research protocol child receive complete diagnostic thyroid examination , include palpation , ultrasound scanning , thyroid hormone laboratory test , fine-needle aspiration , appropriate . Cancer determine expert pathology examination tissue . In addition analysis thyroid radiation measurement make May-June , 1986 , effort make reconstruct person 's exposure estimate radiation dose thyroid . This involve reconstruction deposition pattern environmental pathway radioiodines , location , dietary characteristic , lifestyle person throughout exposure period . The data analyze evaluate relationship , , thyroid disease , especially cancer , radiation dose thyroid , emphasis dose 131I . The primary focus dose-response analysis person-year incidence data stratification sex , age exposure , geographic area , time , age risk . Confounding factor , e.g. , use potassium iodide ( KI ) prophylactic measure , evaluate controlled analysis , uncertainty dose estimate take account . In addition produce risk coefficient thyroid cancer thyroid diseases child function sex age time exposure , expect analysis contribute new knowledge carcinogenic effectiveness 131I comparison x-ray gamma radiation . This information fill major gap world 's knowledge radiation effect , provide guidance radiation protection public health policy wherever nuclear reactor operation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The nuclear power plant accident Chornobyl release large quantity Iodine-131 radioisotope iodine atmosphere , contaminate thousand square kilometer expose million people . For study , well-defined subset Belarusian child age 18 year time accident identify examine well-trained specialist thyroid disease every two year three cycle . The study collaborative effort researcher Belarus United States . &lt; TAB &gt; The cohort include approximately 12,000 person child 1986 , thyroid measure radioactivity week immediately follow accident . Under rigid research protocol subject receive diagnostic thyroid examination , include palpation , ultrasound scanning , thyroid hormone laboratory test . If indicate , refer fine-needle aspiration biopsy . Interview information regard residential , health , diet lifestyle history also collect . All subject follow thyroid cancer morbidity mortality . Overall , 163 cancer identify . Interviews mother subject le 10 year age time accident whose memory event proved inadequate increase total accrual 13,552 . Based thyroid radiation measurement make May-June , 1986 , information ( reconstruction deposition pattern environmental pathway radioiodines , location , dietary characteristic , lifestyle person throughout exposure period ) , person radiation dose thyroid estimate . The aim study assess early late morphologic functional change thyroid gland young person expose radiation radioactive material release consequence Chornobyl nuclear power plant accident , emphasis dose- time-specific change . Active screen thyroid cancer end September 2006 . The third final thyroid screening examination complete September 2006 , identify 163 case thyroid cancer examination period . Subject accrual screening longer ongoing . Thyroid cancer case ascertainment underway linkage Belarusian Cancer Registry . A paper publish radiation dose response prevalent thyroid cancer analyse incident cancer case thyroid disease ongoing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We include 3,000 individual bear Belarus April , 26 , 1986 March , 31 , 1987 expose internal external source ionize radiation prenatal early postnatal period due Chernobyl fallout . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For purpose individual dose reconstruction need establish childmother pair cohort member conduct personal dosimetric interview child mother . We anticipate eligible subject decease time cohort construction . Deceased subject include cohort . Excluded interview study subsequent followup study decease , locate , refuse participate study , provide informed consent .</criteria>
