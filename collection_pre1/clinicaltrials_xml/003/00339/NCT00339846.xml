	<brief_summary>This study determine whether patient craniofrontonasal syndrome ( CFNS ) mutation gene call ephrin-B1 ( EFNB1 ) . CFNS one group condition call craniosynostosis syndrome result closure one fibrous joint bone skull brain growth complete . Because premature closure , brain able grow natural shape ; instead , growth area skull joint yet close . In CFNS , result malformation skull face . It known EFNB1 mutation cause CFNS , study see gene change present patient disorder . This study include patient family member affect CFNS . Participants 1 2 teaspoon blood draw genetic study . A second blood sample may request research . Some blood may use establish cell line later study . This involve grow white blood cell blood sample . The cell keep laboratory make DNA frozen later use study craniosynostosis . Patients may also medical record review relate gene change clinical feature CFNS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The scientific objective study determine patient Craniofrontonasal Syndrome ( CFNS ) contain mutation ephrin-B1 ( EFNB1 ) gene Xq12 . We use mutational analysis EFNB1 principal tool study genetics CFNS . Previously , map CFNS locus 13 cM region Xp22 use linkage analysis 12 unrelated CFNS family 2 affect family member 2-4 generation . More recently two report 23 independent CFNS patient mutation EFNB1 locate Xq12 . Hence , either CFNS display genetic heterogeneity least two gene ( one Xp22 EFNB1 ) previous linkage analysis inaccurate CFNS patient EFNB1 mutation . We previously collect large number cod blood sample patient DFNS . We propose sequence EFNB1 12 previously publish CFNS family well 6 additional family , 22 sporadic CFNS patient , two CFNS patient chromosomal anomaly . We send letter physician refer CFNS patient u past molecular study . This letter outline recent development identify EFNB1 CFNS gene . We would like utilize refer physician liaison lab CFNS patient . Through refer physician , invite patient family join new study interested obtain genetic testing result . All result confirm CLIA-certified lab prior give patient refer physician .</detailed_description>

EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor ) assent . We generally review brief clinical description refer physician potential research subject determine subject appropriate enter study .
