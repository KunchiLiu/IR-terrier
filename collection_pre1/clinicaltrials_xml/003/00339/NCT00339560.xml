	<brief_summary>The key aim study include estimation possible risk associate history gallstone , bacterial infection biliary tract , medical history , diet , use tobacco alcohol , obesity , reproductive factor , family history cancer . Information use examine risk pattern ) seperately anatomic subsite ; b ) among patient gallbladder cancer vs. control undergo cholecystectomy gallstone ; c ) among patient bile duct cancer vs. Hospital control without cancer undergo surgery removal bile duct stone . We also attempt ascertain reason cancer undergo surgery removal bile duct stone . We also attempt ascertain reason rise incidence biliary tract cancer Shanghai . Serum collect subject analyze estrogen hormone , vitamin C E , cholesterol , bacterial antibody ( include salmonella typhi , paratyphi , escherischia coli ) . Bile fluid culture aerobic bacteria , gallstone analyze color , cholesterol , evidence bacteria infection . A major challenge biliary tract cancer research determine cancer risk factor differ gallstone biliary duct stone disease , since many people gallstone ( biliary duct stone ) develop cancer .</brief_summary>
