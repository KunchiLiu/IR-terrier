A short Screening Questionnaire administer adult HU resident invitation extend HUs eligible participate study . A field data collection visit schedule follow week , resident 's convenience . The collection visit conduct two member team ( include field interviewer conduct screening/recruiting visit ) consist administration inform consent form Data Collection Questionnaire , completion home observation form , collection interior dust exterior soil sample , conduct nondestructive paint lead analysis interior exterior wall . Soil dust sample ship analytical laboratory lead allergen analysis . Extensive survey design , procedure , report detail provide National Survey Lead Hazards Allergens Housing : Protocol Sample Design Report ( Attachment A ) . It anticipate study provide allergen-specific data regarding : 1 ) housing condition , demographic factor , climate facilitate evaluation regional , ethnic , socioeconomic , housing characteristic difference indoor allergen burden ; 2 ) estimate indoor allergen exposure U.S. population ; 3 ) baseline data use stimulate future study attempt correlate allergen exposure disease outcome . The study yield lead hazard data : 1 ) estimate number percent home dust soil lead level select threshold ; 2 ) identify source lead dust housing ; 3 ) permit future analysis lead hazard control strategies cost , include associated policy regulatory guideline .</brief_summary>
