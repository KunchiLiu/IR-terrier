	<brief_summary>This study identify chemical protein marker blood people carry human T-lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) , virus associate various pathology , include increase risk adult rare aggressive cancer call adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) . The study also examine difference marker onset ATL . ATL report every area HTLV-1 common , include Caribbean part Japan , West Africa , Middle East , South America , Pacific Melanesia . Risk factor disease largely unknown seem vary among affected different endemic region . People acquire infection early life think high risk infect later . In Japan , men seem great risk woman , evident among black population Caribbean Brazil . Findings study increase understanding cause ATL identify difference tumor characteristic course disease across geographical area . Study subject draw among participant eight study HTLV-1 carrier , include 1 ) Jamaica Mother-Infant Cohort Study , 2 ) Jamaica Family Study , 3 ) Jamaica Food Handlers Study , 4 ) Miyazaki Cohort Study Japan , 5 ) Nagasaki Cohort Study Japan , 6 ) Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study Cancer Cardiovascular Disease , 7 ) HTLV Outcome Studies United States , 8 ) GIPH Cohort Study Brazil . Stored blood sample previously collect patient study develop ATL analyze immunologic genetic factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Adult T-Cell Leukemia/Lymphoma Among Carriers HTLV-1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To characterize molecular marker risk adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma ( ATL ) , whose incidence rate differs greatly across geographic area , propose examine prevalence level viral host immune response marker well protein expression pattern 57 subject subsequently develop ATL 171 match control subject participate various prospective study carrier human T-lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) . Informative marker study include provirus load , HTLV-I antibody titer , anti-Tax protein , clonality HTLV-I infected lymphocyte ( viral marker ) , total immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , neopterin , soluble CD30 , soluble interleukin-2 receptor ( sIL2-R ) , EBV antibody profile ( host immune marker ) , proteomics . These marker select base measurability majority specimen , availability validate assay , relevance biology T-cell malignancy , use cross-sectional comparison HTLV-I carrier non-carriers Japan Caribbean . We utilize central laboratory validate , standard assay specimen . The result , unlinked personal identifier , analyze use generalize estimating equation . The finding understand etiology ATL , differences natural history HTLV-I infection across geographic area . While pursue theme try identify host viral marker associate ATL , unique aspect proposal pool ATL case , extremely rare malignancy , multiple epidemiologic study international collaboration , order achieve adequate statistical power perform valid comparison tumor characteristic across geographic area .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : CASES : Incident ATL case identify various study cohort . For Jamaica Family Study , prevalent case enrol , include case occur among initially unaffected family member . The diagnosis ATL follow universal criterion cohort . For case , one prediagnostic specimen analyze . If one prediagnostic specimen , select early drawdate serum/plasma DNA specimens available . Whenever available , one postdiagnostic specimen also consider analysis longitudinal change marker level . CONTROLS : Fro index case , 2 age , sex , screenmatched asymptomatic HTLVI carrier select control , within cohort case arise ( risk set sample ) . For Jamaica Family Study , control subject select unrelated subject ( spouse incidental recruit unrelated index case ) one two populationbased study unrelated subject ( i.e. , food handler study motherinfant cohort study ) . For control , specimen collect close time pre postdiagnostic phlebotomy case analyze .</criteria>
