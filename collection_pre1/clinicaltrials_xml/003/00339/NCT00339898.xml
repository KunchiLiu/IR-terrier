	<brief_summary>This study determine whether result test call reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) correlate clinical outcome patient Ewing sarcoma , use help identify patient high risk metastasis ( spread cancer beyond original site ) . This companion study another NCI trial ( AEWS0031 ) , examine effectiveness intensify chemotherapy regimen patient Ewing sarcoma . The primary purpose AEWS0031 determine : 1 ) chemotherapy give every 2 week cure patient Ewing sarcoma similar tumor chemotherapy give every 3 week ; 2 ) certain biological characteristic tumor predict well chemotherapy work . Many , , patient Ewing sarcoma metastasize cured standard radiation , surgery , chemotherapy treatment . Most patient whose tumor spread , however , cured standard treatment . A goal future therapy identify patient high risk metastasis give intensive therapy , , conversely , patient low risk relapse receive less toxic treatment . Patients enrol AEWS0031 eligible companion study . No additional procedure require ; RT-PCR testing perform blood bone marrow sample collect AEWS0031 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Clinical evidence metastatic disease time diagnosis indicator poor prognosis Ewing 's sarcoma . Patients non-metastatic disease presentation think good prognosis metastatic disease . Unfortunately , patient appear non-metastatic presentation may relapse initiate complete standard therapy Ewing 's sarcoma . Evidence metastatic disease may determine radiographic study biopsy potential site ( ) disease . It possible identify submicroscopic Ewing 's sarcoma cell blood bone marrow , yet prognostic value find unclear . OBJECTIVES : To determine incidence RT PCR positivity blood bone marrow patient enrol COG AEWS0031 correlate clinical outcome RT PCR positivity . ELIGIBILITY : Concurrent enrollment COG AEWS0031 . DESIGN : This Companion Biology Study , enrol approximately 500 patient . All specimen evaluate translocation , anticipate approximately 30 % specimen RT PCR positivity . Specimens collect time diagnosis , prior cycle 2 chemotherapy , prior initiation local control , end therapy/follow . Batched specimens provide NIH Cooperative Human Tissue Network ( CHTN ) . Following completion COG trial appropriate follow period , RT PCR positivity compare clinical outcome determine prognostic value .</detailed_description>
