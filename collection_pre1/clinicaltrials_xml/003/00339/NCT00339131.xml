	<brief_title>ULTRATRACE Iobenguane I 131 Patients With Malignant Pheochromocytoma , Paraganglioma , Metastatic Carcinoid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iobenguane , also know MIBG , use many patient type cancer cause know neuroendocrine tumor , pheochromocytoma , paraganglioma , carcinoid . Iobenguane absorb neuroendocrine tumor cell . The radioactive portion study drug , Ultratrace iobenguane , form iodine call I 131 . The I 131 absorbed tumor iobenguane , radioactivity kill tumor . The type iobenguane study call Ultratrace new way form iobenguane make . This study first time Ultratrace iobenguane give patient . The purpose study give low dose iobenguane find drug safe , measure long take drug absorbed pass body , see much radioactivity absorb different type tissue body .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients enter one two study arm depend type neuroendocrine tumor . Arm P patient must : Have biochemical histopathological diagnosis either adrenal pheochromocytoma extraadrenal paraganglioma ( biochemical diagnosis include plasmafree metanephrines 24hour urine test catecholamines/metanephrines ) Disease metastatic recur follow surgery Have CT scan perform ( later measurement disease volume core lab ) within 90 day administration study drug without intervention CT iobenguane I 131 image . Arm C patient must : Have histopathological diagnosis carcinoid , plasma chromogranin A ( CgA ) 24hour urine test 5hydroxyindoleaceticacid ( 5HIAA ) Disease metastatic recur follow surgery Have CT scan perform ( later measurement disease volume core lab ) within 90 day administration study drug without intervention CT iobenguane I 131 image . All patient Arm P Arm C must also meet follow inclusion criterion : Provide write informed consent willing comply protocol requirement Are least 18 year age If female , childbearing potential documented history ( e.g. , tubal ligation hysterectomy ) post menopausal minimum 1 year without menses If female childbearing potential , negative serum HCG pregnancy test within 24 hour prior receive iobenguane I 131 If female childbearing potential , agree use acceptable form birth control , define abstinence use IUD , oral contraceptive , barrier spermicide , hormonal implant , throughout study period â€¢ Females nursing Documented history significant allergy require medical intervention shellfish , Xray contrast medium , iodine/iodides , iobenguane Administered radioisotope within 5 effective halflives radioisotope prior study enrollment Karnofsky performance status &lt; 60 Serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal AST/SGOT ALT/SGPT &gt; 3 time upper limit normal Has receive investigational compound and/or medical device within 30 day admission study Has medical condition circumstance would significantly decrease chance obtain reliable data , achieve study objective , complete study and/or post dose followup examination Is determined Investigator patient clinically unsuitable study Has receive medication inhibits uptake iobenguane I 131 within 2 week prior administration study drug . Patients must take tricyclic antidepressant relate drug within 6 week prior enrollment .</criteria>
