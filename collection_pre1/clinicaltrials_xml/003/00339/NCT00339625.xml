	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The primary objective Polyp Prevention Trial ( PPT ) determine whether low fat , high fiber , high vegetable fruit eating plan decrease recurrence adenomatous polyp large bowel . Secondary objective PPT include 1 ) evaluate effectiveness intervention program respect participant achievement dietary goal ; 2 ) examine relation dietary change biochemical marker blood ; 3 ) assess impact intervention quality life indicator . BACKGROUND : Nearly 60,000 men woman die large bowel cancer United States year , make second leading cause death malignant disease country . The evidence diet play key role large bowel carcinogenesis strong growing . The PPT undertaken unlikely , respect diet large bowel cancer , combination animal research , clinical investigation employ non-neoplastic endpoint , observational epidemiologic study would sufficiently persuasive influence public health policy . A large body ecologic , analytic epidemiologic , human metabolic , animal experimental data suggests three dietary factor increase risk large bowel cancer : high dietary fat , low dietary fiber , low vegetable fruit intake . Previous dietary intervention study generally focus single nutrient . The PPT unique three dietary factor investigate simultaneously intervention realistic , comprehensive dietary pattern change . NCI investigator adopt multiple-goal dietary intervention strategy PPT several reason : people eat food , isolated nutrient ; may unknown protective food constituent encompass single-nutrient intervention ; may well important synergistic effect various food component best capture comprehensive , multifactor dietary pattern . Moreover , embrace three promise dietary hypothesis simultaneously , PPT intervention intend maximize possibility reduce polyp recurrence . The direct demonstration effect diet large bowel neoplastic process would major advance . Large bowel adenoma ( polyp ) present unique opportunity conduct intervention trial high prevalence lesion general population ( 30 % adult 50 year age ) , high polyp recurrence rate ( least 10 % annually ) undergone adenoma removal , strong link adenoma cancer ( so-called adenoma-carcinoma sequence ) . It generally accept large bowel adenoma obligate precursor lesion large bowel cancer . An intervention reduce recurrence large bowel polyp would thus strong likelihood reduce incidence large bowel cancer . DESIGN : The PPT randomize , control trial carry eight Clinical Centers United States . The Data Nutrition Coordinating Center ( DNCC ) Westat , Inc. , Rockville , Maryland . The target sample size 2000 permit detection 90 % power reduction 24 % polyp recurrence rate . The dietary goal intervention arm 20 % calorie fat , 18g fiber/1000 kcal , 5-8 serving fruit vegetable ( exact number base caloric intake ) . The usual ( control ) diet , base data national survey , expect comprise approximately 35 % calorie fat , 10-15 g per day dietary fiber , 3.5 serving vegetable fruit daily . The overall strategy intervention program reduce calorie fat replace calorie fruit vegetable grain thus increase dietary fiber intake . The intervention program , pattern approach use feasibility phase Women 's Health Trial , integrate nutrition education behavior modification technique . Although initial counseling session carry one-on-one PPT nutritionist , intervention group member participate group counsel first year . The control group offer nutrition intervention program since general strategy adopt group minimum interference customary diet collect nutritional data consider necessary appropriate comparison nutrition intervention group . Subjects control group expect maintain usual diet . Three different dietary assessment instrument use PPT : modify Block/NCI Food Frequency Questionnaire ( FFQ ) , Four Day Food Records ( 4DFR ) , 24 Hour Recalls . Participants undergo colonoscopy one ( T1 ) four ( T4 ) year study . Over 280 endoscopists participate PPT carry T1 T4 colonoscopy . Although recurrence one adenoma primary endpoint study , also possible relate dietary intervention number , size , histotype polyp . Because polyp ( 10-15 % ) tend miss baseline , primary analytic interval ( sample size calculation base ) T1 T4 . The presence one adenoma qualify colonoscopy -- key eligibility factor PPT -- determine Clinical Center trial pathologist previously orient central pathologist PPT pathologic criterion . The number , size , location adenoma baseline determine participate endoscopists . To standardize histologic diagnosis use endpoint ascertainment , PPT require histologic type extent atypia determine central pathologist lesion remove baseline , T1 , T4 . Blood specimen collect participant annually ; analyze 20 % participant sample ( individual diet record analyze ) lipid , carotenoid , vitamins A E. Blood specimen also available analysis include hormone molecular genetic analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Men woman time randomization 35 year age old remove within 6 month randomization one adenomatous polyp confirm histologically Clinical Center trial pathologist . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Persons follow characteristic ineligible study : Carcinoma polyp remove baseline endoscopy . High grade dysplasia consider carcinoma purpose study eligibility . Failure examine cecum baseline colonoscopy . Incomplete removal polyp baseline colonoscopy . Surgical removal polyp . Familial polyposis polyposis syndrome . Adenomatous polyp discover age 35 . History large bowel cancer , include intramucosal carcinoma . History histologically radiographically confirm inflammatory bowel disease ( ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease ) . History large bowel resection . Weight move 150 % desirable weight accord 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance Tables . Use lipidlowering drug pharmacologic dos last month . Major lifelimiting condition reduce likelihood complete 4year followup . Already consume dietary pattern similar intervention eating plan . Any dietary practice , behavior , attitude would substantially limit adherence intervention program . Participation clinical study may interfere participation PPT . Unable unwilling sign inform consent form . Found unreliable uncooperative provider dietary information prerandomization period . Able give reasonable assurance remain Clinical Center area duration study .</criteria>
