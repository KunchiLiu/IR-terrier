	<brief_summary>Human T-lymphotrophic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) endemic southern Japan Caribbean , disease manifestation differ across geographic region . Though age , gender , route infection may determine natural history infection , observe geographic difference also may , part , reflect distinct genetic background host evidence distribution human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) presence environmental factor . Studies already complete ongoing show notable difference incidence prevalence HTLV-I associate disease underscore need comparative study analyse area . This prospective new study blood donor Jamaica provide u opportunity address many hypothesis regard HTLV-I transmission pathogenesis Caribbean comparison ongoing cohort study HTLV-I carrier Japan . This study - identify host factor associate HTLV-I carrier status HTLV-I pathogenesis . - directly calculate incidence HTLV-I associate disease population . - examine role HTLV-I pathogenesis common infectious agent . Approximately 5,000+ blood donor come National Blood Transfusion year screen HTLV-I serology . Of agreed participate , HTLV-I carrier age- , sex-matched HTLV-I-negatives invite University West Indies clinic full study enrollment . Study participant give standardized questionnaire , full physical examination , phlebotomy ( 25-30 mL ) , follow every year interim health status additional phlebotomy . All subject receive ophthalmologic examination detection uveitis ocular disease . Some subject refer neurologist , hematologist dermatologist , accord sign symptom . Approximately 1200 HTLV-I carrier 600 HTLV-I negative recruit longitudinal follow-up next 5-year period . Two type analysis conduct : comparison HTLV-I-positive HTLV-I-negative subject , comparison among HTLV carrier high level viral load low level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History HTLV-I Infection : Prospective Follow-up Cohort Blood Donors Jamaica</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Southern Japan Caribbean endemic human T-lymphotropic virus type I ( HTLV-I ) infection . In area , however , epidemiology HTLV-I appear differ . Various observation population-based study indicate difference host immune response virus infection likely result different frequency disease manifestation across geographic region . While gender , age route infection may partly determine host immune response , observed geographic difference may also reflect , part , host genetic background evidence distribution human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) presence environmental factor . The reported difference underscore need comparative study endemic area . In addition , analyse large , pool data HTLV-I carrier different geographic area need ensure statistical power study gene-environment interaction extend use molecular marker . However , exist population-based study Japan Caribbean unfortunately comparable respect study subject 's age gender distribution . In order address issue , propose study blood donor Jamaica , enroll large number HTLV-I positive HTLV-I negative , consist subject comparable exist Japanese study respect age sex . The propose study provide basis comparative study HTLV-I carrier Japan Jamaica comprehensive analysis host genetic background HTLV-I associated illness Black population .</detailed_description>
