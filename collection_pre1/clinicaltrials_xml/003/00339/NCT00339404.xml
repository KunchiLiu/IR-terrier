	<brief_summary>In collaboration member The International Melanoma Consortium , propose study melanoma family lack mutation cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2 ( CDKN2 p16 ) gene , cyclin-dependant kinase 4 ( CDK4 ) . CDKN2 CDK4 gene encode presume tumor suppressor gene , mutant form know cause increase susceptibility melanoma . The purpose present study confirm existence identify additional gene ( ) involve heritable melanoma ( cutaneous ocular ) precursor lesion ( atypical nevus ) linkage analysis gene mapping strategy . It clear risk develop atypical nevus and/or melanoma strongly influence genetic environmental factor ( e.g . sun exposure ) . Characterization gene could provide important insight inheritance , pathogenesis , treatment increasingly important disease .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Inclusion study restrict family contain least three CMM case DNA available genotyping , CDKN2A CDK4 involvement exclude . All family must mutation negative CDKN2A CDK4 . This study also include family least one case ocular two case cutaneous melanoma , least 2 ocular melanoma ( except occur parent child ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any family show evidence haplotype share 9p21p22 region , CDKN2A locate , also exclude .</criteria>
