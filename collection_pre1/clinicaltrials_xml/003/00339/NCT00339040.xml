	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Novel Human Papillomavirus Vaccine HIV Infected Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genital HPV infection common sexually transmit infection world may lead genital wart , anogenital dysplasia , invasive cancer . HIV infected people others compromise immunity great risk HPV-related complication . In particular , researcher concern risk HPV infection woman , may infect male partner , especially partner engage anal intercourse . HIV infected woman tend multiple type HPV ( associate great risk HPV-related disease ) , less likely clear HPV-related condition , likely progress HPV-related disease . The quadrivalent HPV ( type 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 ) L1 virus-like particle ( VLP ) vaccine test study safe generally well tolerate previous study conduct healthy HPV-exposed adolescent , young adult , old woman . However , still unclear vaccine safe elicit similar immune response young child . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity novel quadrivalent HPV ( Types 6 , 11 , 16 , 18 ) L1 VLP vaccine HIV infect child 7 12 year age . This study two stage last least 108 week . In Stage I , participant stratify CD4 percentage ( CD4 % ) nadir CD4 % study screening ( Stratum A : CD4 % Nadir &lt; 15 CD4 % ≥ 15 screening , Stratum B : CD4 % Nadir ≥ 15 &lt; 25 CD4 % ≥ 15 screening , Stratum C : CD4 % Nadir ≥ 25 CD4 % ≥ 25 screening ) . Within stratification group , randomly assign one two arm . During Stage I , Arm A ( QHPV : Quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine ) participant receive 3 dos vaccine , Arm B ( Placebo/QHPV ) participant receive 3 dos placebo . Participants know whether receive vaccine placebo . Participants receive assign intervention study entry Weeks 8 24 . At Week 96 , Stage II begin , study participant tell receive vaccine placebo Stage I . Arm A participant receive additional dose vaccine Week 96 ; Arm B participant receive dos vaccine Weeks 96 , 104 , 120 . Over course study , least 12 study visit . A physical exam blood collection occur visit ; medical history occur select visit . After vaccination , participant observe least 30 minute monitor allergic reaction possibly result vaccination . For 15 day follow vaccination , parent guardian ask complete `` report card '' detail child 's sign symptom . Three day vaccination , parent guardian study participant contact telephone ask adverse event child may experience .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Children age ≥ 7 &lt; 12 year age . A confirmed diagnosis HIV infection , define two positive assay two different sample . The two result may combination follow : age : Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) PCR age &gt; 4 week : p24 antigen detection age &gt; 18 month : license ELISA ( Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ) confirmatory Western Blot CD4 % ≥ 15 time screening require ( Note minimum requirement , Stratum C CD4 % need ≥ 25 ) . For Strata A B : Currently stable ( ≥ 3 month ) highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) regimen , define three antiretrovirals least two different therapeutic class , therapy combination azidothymidine , lamivudine , abacavir . For stratum C antiretroviral therapy require . Parent legal guardian able willing provide sign informed consent . Negative urine pregnancy test sensitive 25 International Unit ( IU ) betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( HCG ) girl menstruate ( child bear potential ) . Female study volunteer participate sexual activity could lead pregnancy must agree use two reliable method contraception , one must barrier method . A barrier method contraception ( condoms cervical cap ) together another reliable form contraception ( condom , spermicidal agent ; diaphragm cervical cap spermicide ; intrauterine device [ IUD ] ; hormonalbased contraception ) must use study . Condoms recommend appropriate use contraception method effective prevent HIV1 transmission Males participate study must attempt impregnate woman , participate sperm donation program . Males engage sexual activity could lead pregnancy must use condom . Exclusion Criteria Body temperature ≥ 101 F ≥ 38.3 C , orally determine , within 72 hour prior first subsequent injection . Subjects may vaccinate time next seven day thereafter , provide site investigator satisfy febrile illness end . Total bilirubin ≥ 5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) screening . Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) ≥ 5 x ULN screen absence explain cause ( determine site investigator ) screening . Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5 mg/dL screening . Absolute neutrophil count ≤ 750 cells/mm3 screening . Hemoglobin ≤ 9.9 g/dL screening . Platelet count ≤ 75,000 cells/mm³ screening . Presence acute opportunistic nonbacterial bacterial infection require therapy time enrollment ; subject may enter he/she stable appropriate antiinfective therapy . Chemotherapy active malignancy . Other know suspected disease immune system , immunosuppressive therapy . Prior treatment immunosuppressive immunomodulation therapy within 60 day screen . Prior treatment three weeklong course corticosteroid ( ≥ 2.0 mg/kg ≥ 20 mg total prednisoneequivalent ) within one year screening ; systemic ( oral parenteral ) steroid ( ≥ 2.0 mg/kg ≥ 20 mg total prednisoneequivalent ≥ 3 day ) within 30 day study entry . Prior vaccination inactivate vaccine receive within two week dose study vaccine , vaccination may plan two week dose study vaccine . Prior vaccination live vaccine receive within three week dose study vaccine , vaccination may plan two week dose study vaccine . Prior diagnosis sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) , genital wart , juvenile recurrent papillomatosis . History severe allergic reaction ( e.g. , swell mouth throat , difficulty breathing , hypotension , shock ) require medical intervention . Known allergy vaccine component , include aluminum , yeast , BENZONASE™ ( nuclease , Nycomed [ use remove residual nucleic acid vaccine ] ) . Previous treatment immune globulin preparation bloodderived product within six month prior first injection none may plan study . Known coagulation disorder would contraindicate Intramuscular ( IM ) injection . Any clinically significant disease ( HIV infection ) clinically significant finding screen medical history physical examination , investigator 's opinion , would compromise outcome study . Breastfeeding .</criteria>
