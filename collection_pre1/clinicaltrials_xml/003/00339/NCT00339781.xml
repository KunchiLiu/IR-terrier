	<brief_summary>This study , conduct St. Bartholomew 's Hospital , London , England , determine whether cell pass mother offspring pregnancy increase decrease child 's risk develop type 1 diabetes . Previous research show certain cell pass mother child pregnancy may affect child 's chance develop autoimmune disease . The cell mother may persist child 's blood year birth stimulate child 's immune system way may either increase decrease chance child develop diabetes . This study determine whether cell present identical twin , one twin type 1 diabetes . Participants British Diabetic Twins Study England may eligible participate . Of twin pair study , one must type 1 diabetes must free disease . The twin ' mother must alive willing provide blood sample . For female twin , child must alive willing provide either blood buccal cell sample ( cheek swab ) . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Both twin twin pair provide blood sample collect single occasion . - The mother twin pair provide blood sample collect single occasion . - Children female twin provide single sample either mouth blood . For child young 12 year age , cell sample collect inside mouth ( buccal ) use toothbrush . The child stroke inside ( cheek ) mouth toothbrush ten time side , spit collection vial , immediately rinse mouth water add rinse sample collection vial . Children 12 year age may provide either buccal cell sample blood sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Type 1 diabetes one several autoimmune disease unclear etiology discordance rate identical twin 30-40 % , even many year follow-up . This intermediate discordance rate indicate clearly genetic factor play susceptibility type 1 diabetes , genetic contribution come HLA locus . However , discordance rate also mean , non-genetic factor , possibly environmental , lead development disease one two genetically identical individual . No consensus exist nature putative environmental difference , remarkable occur twin generally share intrauterine , family school environment . Recent evidence suggest development certain autoimmune disease , particularly scleroderma , may influence microchimerism : Both fetomaternal microchimerisms ( persistence fetal cell maternal circulation birth child ) maternofetal microchimerism ( persistence maternal cell child 's circulation year birth ) suggest create abnormal environment might stimulate development autoimmunity genetically susceptible individual . The reverse also possible , i.e. , abnormal cell may stimulate immune system way autoimmunity develop . Identical monozygotic ( MZ ) twin discordant type 1 diabetes offer unique experimental model test hypothesis quantitative difference persistent maternofetal microchimerism influence development type 1 diabetes genetically susceptible individual . This study use pair MZ twin discordant type 1 diabetes already participate British Diabetic Twins Study conduct Dr. David Leslie St. Bartholomew 's Hospital London , UK . If mother twin ( female male ) offspring female twin ( ) available study , ask provide single blood sample ( twin , mother , offspring great 12 year age ) buccal cell sample ( offspring less equal 12 year age ) DNA purify . This confirm origin chimeric cell ; since cell pass mother offspring pregnancy , require ( DNA ) sample mother twin ( male female ) participate study . But since opposite true , cell also pass offspring mother pregnancy , require ( DNA ) sample female twin ' offspring determine true origin chimeric cell . The DNA use HLA genotyping identify nonshared HLA allele use develop specific assay persistence maternal DNA twin ' circulation quantitative PCR mother 's genotype CD3+ cell isolate twin . Since traffic chimeric cell bi-directional , twin offspring may chimeric cell fetal maternal origin circulation . To confirm origin chimeric cell , blood buccal cell collect offspring twin genotyped compare genotype twin ' mother . Blood drawn DNA purify Dr. Leslie 's group London ; genotyping quantitative PCR perform Dr. Artlett 's group Thomas Jefferson University , Philadelphia , study microchimerism since 1998 . Results study may provide evidence support microchimerism influential factor development type 1 diabetes . Evidence support concept would important addition literature `` environmental '' factor influence type 1 diabetes etiology , also suggest potential immunosuppression strategy type 1 diabetes prevention .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA : The twin subject focus study great equal 12 year age diabetes discordance must present great 5 year . The subject must able understand sign inform consent document , thus severe mental incapacity exclusion criterion . Female twin must currently pregnant miscarriage abortion . Identical twin pair ( female male ) must undergo organ bone marrow transplantation , blood transfusion time live . There health status criterion participate study , except note . Patients may preexist condition . There age limit offspring twin . Subjects exclude base gender , ethnicity , race religion .</criteria>
