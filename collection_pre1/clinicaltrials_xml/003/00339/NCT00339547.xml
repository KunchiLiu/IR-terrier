	<brief_title>Risk Factors Uterine Fibroids : A Case Control Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine leiomyoma lead cause hysterectomy United States , account 200,000 procedure year . Leiomyoma common condition many tumor asymptomatic . It known woman fibroid develop clinical symptom . In 1996-1999 NIEHS Uterine Fibroid Study enrol 1245 randomly select premenopausal woman , age 35 49 , randomly select membership role George Washington University Health Plan , large prepay health plan Washington , D.C. Slightly half participant African American . Participants ask prior diagnosis uterine leiomyoma , 87 % examine abdominal/transvaginal ultrasound screen uterine leiomyoma . Sixty-two percent 1245 either prior diagnosis leiomyoma sonogram evidence condition . Study Objectives : 1 . Monitor fibroid-related symptom time ( Two follow-ups five-year period ) . 2 . Measure proportion woman undergo major medical intervention ( hysteroscopic resection , uterine artery embolization , laser coagulation , myomectomy , hysterectomy ) . 3 . Identify risk factor increase symptom severity . 4 . Identify risk factor treatment intervention . Methods : Premenopausal participant Uterine Fibroid Study ( 1996-1999 ) recontacted twice year 2001 - 2005 obtain information leiomyoma-related symptom medical surgical treatment . Data collect computer-assisted telephone interview . Medical record ultrasound MRI examination major medical surgical intervention abstract verify medical follow-up treatment . Significance : The presence leiomyoma identify ultrasound screen condition asymptomatic . However , data available allow clinician predict woman experience morbidity . This longitudinal study trace disease progression , identify factor relate increase symptom severity medical/surgical treatment . The finding could use develop systematic scoring system use identify woman high risk .</detailed_description>
