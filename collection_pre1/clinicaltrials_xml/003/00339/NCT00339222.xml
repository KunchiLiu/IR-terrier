	<brief_summary>During course case-control study melanoma conduct Bufalini Hospital , Cesena , Italy year 1994-1996 , 20 family 2 3 melanoma case identify study . The area study conduct show steep increase melanoma incidence Mediterranean population year 1987 1997 . Clinical characteristic melanoma family study similar typically described fair-skinned population , relevant mutation cod region know candidate gene melanoma find . Lack finding could due modest number family small number affect CMM case examine . We exclude possibility alteration intron , splice site promoter region . Also epigenetic factor could affect expression gene product study . Alternatively , germline alteration gene ( ) candidate gene analyze may play important role melanoma predisposition population . A large number family need test hypothesis . These additional family could provide important contribution understand melanoma development . In fact , population generally host characteristic usually associate high risk melanoma ( e.g. , light skin color , red hair , blue eye , multiple freckle , tendency sunburn , etc . ) relative high frequency dysplastic nevus melanoma . The main objective study recruit family Bufalini Hospital , Cesena , Italy order reach large sample size . Recently , 16 potential melanoma-prone family identify patient 's physician ' referral Dermatologists Bufalini Hospital . The dermatologist maintain close relationship member family confident subject would willing participate study contact . The first goal study contact family group verify willingness participate study . In addition , new family could identify recruit . We propose conduct pilot project . We estimate recruitment approximately 25 family 2 melanoma case first -degree relative one-year period , include 16 family already identify approximately 10 new kindred . At end pilot phase determine feasibility continue recruitment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To date 557 subject , include case melanoma unaffected relative , recruit family study melanoma Bufalini Hospital , Cesena , Italy , University ofl'Aquila , L'Aquila , Italy , Istituto Valenciano de Oncologia , Valencia , Spain . Clinical characteristic melanoma family study similar typically described fair-skinned population . In original study Bufalini Hospital , 7 % family analyze show carry mutation CDKN2A gene , know candidate gene melanoma , mutation additional susceptibility gene identify . The possibility alteration intron , splice site , promoter region exclude . Also , epigenetic factor could affect expression gene product study . Alternatively , germline alteration gene ( ) candidate gene may play important role melanoma predisposition population . We begin genome-wide scanning first 47 family . There evidence linkage either chromosome 9 chromosome 1 , previously show susceptibility locus melanoma . We extend sample size also include melanoma-prone family Italian investigator . We perform fine mapping locus appear interesting first linkage analysis . We confirm previous association disease publish manuscript report null result . Some family also analyze together family worldwide linkage genome-wide association study goal identify locus potentially important melanoma etiology . Moreover , individual study analyze presence variant susceptibility gene pigmentation , DNA repair , pathways together melanoma sample case-control study ( 02-C- N ( 35 ) . Finally , family three affected individual ongoing exomic sequencing goal identify novel locus associate melanoma susceptibility . More 100 subject sequenced date . We identify potentially important candidate gene melanoma investigate additional family melanoma case verify whether replicate finding . This protocol propose continue recruitment family order reach large sample size future analysis . The additional family could provide important contribution understand melanoma development . In addition , protocol proposes continue recruit subject tissue study subgroup Bufalini Hospital Cesena , Unviersity I ' Aquila , Italy Istituto Valenciano de Oncologia , Valencia , Spain . To date , 98 subject enrol study . The study aim investigate progression nevus melanoma cross sectional study melanoma case . The tissue study component focus comparison gene expression , somatic mutation , genetic variant , proteomics profile normal skin , common melanocytic nevus , dysplastic nevus , melanoma tissue sample individual ( familial sporadic case ) . Each subject complete interview base questionnaire sun exposure , pigmentation , sunsensitivity , family medical history , melanoma risk factor donate blood sample .</detailed_description>
