	<brief_summary>This study evaluate structure error self-reporting instrument diet , follow Observing Protein Energy Nutrition Study ( OPEN ) conduct 1999 2000 . The OPEN study , large kind , result wealth nutritional biomarker data-measurable indicator change organisms level molecule cell . A biomarker could help understand environment disease related disease risk . Furthermore , finding show relative estimate disease risk may weaken food frequency questionnaire 24-hour questionnaire . Scientists long recognize self-reported information questionnaire interview contains error , uncertainty structure error . For propose study , food record food checklist-adjusted food frequency questionnaire compare previously use questionnaire , determine whether new study instrument present less chance measurement error . The result may provide good tool study nutritional epidemiology , , incidence aspect disease nutrition . OPEN study participant invite follow-up . Patients complete 1999-2000 study currently pregnant liquid weight loss diet may eligible study . The original study recruit men woman 40 69 year age . A letter summary result original OPEN study send 482 participant . Both Food Record food checklist , call Daily Food List , instrument give . The Food Record ask participant record food beverage consume . The Daily Food List ask respondent write number time limited number food category consume . In addition , respondent ask complete National Cancer Institute Diet History Questionnaire ( DHQ ) , identical one complete original OPEN study , regard previous 12 month . Participants randomly assign one two group . All receive four study mailing 3-month period : DHQ , First 4-Day Food Record ( 4-day FR ) , Second 4-day FR , Booklet 7-Day Food Lists ( 7-day FL ) , latter listing select food participant mark consume reporting day . Study Group A receive DHQ , first 4-day FR , second 4-day FR , 7-day FL . Study Group B receive DHQ , 7-day FL , first 4-day FR , second 4-day FR . Within 10 day receive DHQ , participant call schedule appointment 30- 45-minute visit . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Complete Physical Activity Questionnaire ( telephone move local area unable attend visit ) - Have weight measure - Be ask whether recently develop certain medical condition , experience dramatic change diet , gain special education nutrition The completion time instrument dietary assessment approximately follow : - DHQ-60 minute . - Each 4-day FR-80 minute ( 20 minute day ) . - 7-day FL-35 49 minute ( 5 7 minute day ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recontacting Participants Observing Protein Energy Nutrition ( OPEN ) Study : Re-OPEN</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NCI carry extensive research surveillance activity rely self-reported dietary information questionnaire interview . Although scientist long recognize information contain error , considerable uncertainty remain structure . The interpretation find NCI 's nutritional epidemiology surveillance effort critically dependent assessment dietary measurement error . We evaluate measurement error previously conduct Observing Protein Energy Nutrition Study ( OPEN ) conduct 1999 2000 . This study , large study kind , use unbiased biomarkers dietary intake ( doubly label water energy 24-hour urinary nitrogen protein ) ass measurement error dietary assessment method commonly use epidemiology surveillance research around world . The landmark finding indicate relative risk estimate nutritional epidemiology may severely attenuate use food frequency questionnaires conventional use 24-hour dietary recall reference measurement may lead severe underestimate extent attenuation . Key question remain regard whether finding hold diverse population , dietary-report physical activity instrument , across vary nutrient food group , measurement error affect relative risk exist prospective cohort . In light OPEN study finding , would like re-contact participant , already wealth nutritional biomarker data , order ass structure measurement error respect two self-reported dietary assessment instrument : food record food checklist-adjusted food frequency questionnaire . Our intent evaluate whether instrument might favorable measurement error structure food frequency questionnaire , thereby provide well tools nutritional epidemiology .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : As followup previous study NCI SSIRB approval , recruitment new participant . In original OPEN study , recruit sample men woman 4069 year age . This age group represent likely recruit largescale epidemiological study diet cancer . It group seek assess measurement error problem dietary assessment instrument .</criteria>
