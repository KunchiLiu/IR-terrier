	<brief_summary>This study , sponsor jointly National Cancer Institute Tehran University Medical Sciences , explore cause cancer stomach esophagus ( tube run mouth stomach ) Northern Iran . This unique area study follow reason : - Some high rate esophageal cancer world report northeastern Iran 109 case per 100,000 men 175 case per 100,000 woman year 40 time high rate cancer United States . - In area Iran , unlike area world , disease affect woman men . - Within 300 mile along southern border Caspian Sea , rate fall 10 case per 100,000 people per year . The high rate disease area , unique geographic distribution case , exceptionally high rate woman make Northern Iran promise site study esophageal stomach cancer . Patients 30 year age old refer upper gastrointestinal disease Atrak Clinic Gonbad , Golestan Province , Iran , suspect esophageal cancer may eligible study . In addition , control subject 30 year age old certain specify disease recruit patient refer four hospital Gonbad Taleghani Clinic . After give informed consent , participant undergo follow procedure : - Interviews , include question age , ethnicity , education , demographic data ; habit , tobacco , opium , alcohol consumption ; personal family medical history ; diet , special attention food preservation , cook method , drink water ; physical activity ; occupational residential history ; body measurement ; sign symptoms upper gastrointestinal disease ; oral hygiene ; animal contact ; transfusion history ; family socioeconomic status . - Blood draw ( 15 milliliter , 1 tablespoon ) genetic chemical test marker may predict get disease . - Hair nail sampling identify mineral compound whose exposure may relate esophageal cancer . - Endoscopy evaluate health esophagus stomach . This test perform case patient control participant give permission . Before examination , subject swallow liquid numbs throat may give medicine vein promote drowsiness . The subject swallow tube ( endoscope ) doctor look esophagus stomach take sample tissue look disease . The tissue sample examine microscopically store possible future genetic testing relate diagnose determine risk esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This case-control study ( first phase GEMINI project ) primarily focus explore etiology ( etiology ) squamous cell carcinoma esophagus northern Iran . Esophageal gastric cancer , together , responsible 1,000,000 annual death world . In 1996 , cancer stomach esophagus rank first second respectively , among frequent cancer Iran , exclude skin cancer . Some high incidence rate esophageal cancer world report Northeastern Iran , Northern Gonbad , Age Standardized Rates ( ASR ) 109/100,000 men 175/100,000 woman ( 1 ) . These rate approximately 40 time higher see US . In area , unlike area world , incidence high woman men . Additionally , within 300 mile along southern border Caspian Sea , rate fall 10/100,000 . The high rate EC world , unique geographical distribution case , exceptionally high rate among woman make Northern Iran intrigue site study disease . An upper-GI referral clinic ( Atrak Clinic ) already establish Gonbad , Golestan Province , DDRC researcher conduct feasibility study clinic . For case-control study , local internist health system worker refer suspect case esophageal cancer Clinic . All patient undergo endoscopy biopsy ascertainment diagnosis . Patients histologically confirm esophageal squamous cell carcinoma esophagus consent join study enrol case . There two control group study , one select neighborhood case subject one patient refer Atrak Clinic cancer . The neighborhood control group serve primary control group . Both case control interview undergo collection biological specimen include blood , hair nail . Free ( optional ) endoscopy also offer neighborhood control . A four-year accrual 300 case , 600 neighborhood control 300 clinic control expect . Environmental risk factor ( include life-style , habit , nutritional status ) assess questionnaire objective measurement biological specimen . The role genetic polymorphism study use genomic DNA case control . A subset sample collect case control use evaluate gene expression pattern , use microarray analysis , difference serum protein pattern , use SELDI analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Cases : Cases recruit studied Atrak Clinic , Gonbad City . All patient refer Atrak Clinic suspect EC . Patients 30 year age Gonbad , Minodasht , Kalaleh , Ramyan , AzadShahr , MaravehTappeh , surround village histopathological diagnosis confirm ESCC consent join study enrol case . Controls : Controls recruit one four hospital city ( Shohada , Motahary , Khatam , Borzouieh ) , major referral outpatient clinic ( Taleghani Clinic ) . Controls select patient 30 year age refer four hospital city Taleghani Clinic . Only patient refer certain disease select control . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Controls : No association tobacco alcohol consumption , main know risk factor esophageal cancer ( lung cancer , cardiovascular disease . Not cause major change diet lifestyle long time ( major GI disease , chronic malignancy , diabetes ) .</criteria>
