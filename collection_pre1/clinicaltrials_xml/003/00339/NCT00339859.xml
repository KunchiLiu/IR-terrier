	<brief_summary>The Laboratory Human Carcinogenesis Pharmocogenetics Section Genetic Epidemiology Branch conduct lung cancer case-control study Baltimore , Maryland . The primary hypothesis study determine mutagen sensitivity , p53 induction apoptosis culture lymphocyte predictive lung cancer risk . While study examine mutagen sensitivity , none assay well-studied epidemiological setting . Because methodological issue describe herein , propose development new assay , study view pilot therefore hypotheses generate . The design molecular epidemiology study specifically develop test reliability validity mutagen sensitivity assay , case-control study need assess possibility case bias ( i.e. , result vary due concurrent presence lung cancer rather risk ) . Importantly , protocol establish resource allow validation assay also study biomarkers gene-environment interaction , especially related DNA repair . Th secondary goal study 1 ) demonstrate gene-neuro-behavioral interaction smoke addiction control 2 ) ass relationship sex-steroid metabolism estrogen exposure lung cancer risk . Cases histologically confirm lung cancer reside Baltimore surround area . They identify six hospital Baltimore . Cases recently diagnose blood collect prior chemotherapy radiation therapy . Because requirement obtain sample treatment ( surgical case least two month surgery ) , recognize case ascertainment reduce , critical data ass difference eligible ineligible subject collect tumor registry . Two control group use , first hospital-based ( frequency match age , gender , race , smoke hospital ) second population-based ( frequency match age- , gender race ) . The first control group allow u examine risk factor lung cancer independent smoking ( odds ration smoke = 1.0 ) , second allow result extrapolate general population also use validate phenotyping assay . The strategy recruitment allow u over-sample woman African Americans , examination data entire study group , ass difference subgroup . Cases control receive structure , person interview assess prior medical cancer history , tobacco use , alcohol use , current medication , occupational history , family medical history , menstrual history estrogen use , recent nutritional supplement caffeine intake , socioeconomic status . The questionnaire also include Fagerstrom index nicotine dependence ( FTND ) , Center Epidemiologic Studies Depression ( CES-D ) scale , modify version Horn-Waingrow Reasons Smoking ( RFS ) Scale . The phenotypic marker study assess DNA repair cellular response use lymphocyte culture expose vitro radiation , bleomycin , benzo ( ) pyrene-diol-expoxide N-methyl-nitrosurea measure induction chromosomal aberration , p53 induction apoptosis . DNA case control also use genetic polymorphism analysis carcinogen metabolism , relate dopaminergic system nicotinic receptor . Tumors case evaluate estrogen progesterone receptor . The target accrual number total subject 1,200 100 case combination gender race ( Caucasian- African Americans ) , match 100 hospital-based population-based control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The Laboratory Human Carcinogenesis conduct observational non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) case-control study Baltimore , MD . This molecular epidemiology study develop test reliability validity mutagen sensitivity assay , case-control study need assess possibility case bias . Importantly , protocol establishes resource allows study additional biomarkers gene-environment interaction . Upon recruitment , case control receive structure , person interview assess prior medical cancer history , use tobacco electronic cigarette , alcohol use , current medication , occupational history , family medical history , menstrual history estrogen use , recent nutritional supplement caffeine intake , socioeconomic status . Specimen collection consist one-time blood sample and/or mouthwash collect cheek cell ( oral cell ) one-time urine sample . In addition , cancer surround non-cancer tissue surgically remove need diagnosis may obtain case , well current medical information medical record . Primary cell culture may establish available fresh tumor tissue . The phenotypic marker study assess proficiency DNA repair lymphocyte culture expose vitro radiation , bleomycin , benzo ( ) pyrene-diol-epoxide measure induction chromosomal aberration , p53 apoptosis . DNA buffy coat cheek cell use analysis germline variation form Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ( SNPs ) gene involve DNA repair , innate immunity , cell cycle control , angiogenesis , apoptosis , cytokine , nicotine addiction , inflammation , hormone metabolism microRNA . Additionally , IRB approval receive 2010 include study multi-institution genome-wide association study ( GWAS ) lung cancer African Americans . Tumors case evaluate estrogen progesterone receptor , somatic mutation , gene expression . Urine , plasma , serum tissue sample metabolomics analyze untargeted approach . Objectives : 1 . To determine mutagen sensitivity , p53 induction , apoptosis culture lymphocyte predictive lung cancer risk . 2 . To determine relationship sex-steroid metabolism , estrogen exposure , lung cancer risk . 3 . To investigate develop phenotypic predictive marker lung cancer risk survival , base mutagen sensitivity , polymorphic marker , gene expression , metabolomics . 4 . To investigate racial disparity associate lung cancer risk survival . 5 . To examine relationship circulate cytokine risk survival lung cancer establish robust method cytokine detection . 6 . To generate accurate measure ancestry use ancestry informative marker analysis integrate variable study health disparity 7 . To conduct study metabolomics serum , plasma urine purpose discover novel marker risk , diagnosis prognosis . We use ultraperformance liquid chromatography couple mass spectrometry ( UPLS-MS ) search small molecular weight endogenous metabolite classify cancer predict outcome . This novel approach biomarker discovery also leverage non-invasive process biospecimen collection . Tumor correspond non tumor tissue correspond patient also test use method extend discovery novel tumor metabolite . Further , metabolites vitamin D examine serum sample lung cancer case control assess relationship circulating level Vitamin D metabolites cancer risk survival . This analysis couple test Vitamin D pathway SNPs correspond patient determine certain SNPs also associate level vitamin D. 8 . To evaluate biomarkers cancer diagnosis prognosis circulate tumor DNA 9 . To evaluate microbiome ( microbe ) present lung tissue use situ hybridization fix tissue complete Mayo Clinic collaborator . The collaborator receive information sample tissue origin . 10 . To collect data biospecimens patient receive low dose CT screen part lung cancer diagnosis . This purpose investigate non-invasive biomarkers lung cancer diagnosis prognosis . Low-dose CT screening offer UMMS VA purpose early lung cancer detection . These screen guideline per CMS guideline , i.e. , age 55-77 , &gt; =30 pack-years smoke quit smoking 15 year less . Such high-risk patient offer annual screening . 11 . To culture lung cancer specific microbiome-bacteria human lung cancer . This work , part , conduct collaborator Dr Paul Owrin , expert culture microbial specie human tissue . These sample , approximately 10 per year , de-identified patient information . Eligibility : - Histologically confirm NSCLC diagnose within past 2 year ( case ) . - Frequency match case accord age ( 5-year interval ) , gender , race ( population-based control ) . - Born United States , resident state Maryland - Subject Characteristics : - Speaks English well enough interview - Physically mentally capable perform interview ( i.e. , must able hear interviewer , mentally comprehend interviewer question , verbally respond ) - Has never interview control study - Does currently reside institution prison , nursing home , shelter - No history cancer non-melanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix ( population-based control ) - Has residential work phone within home ( population-based control ) Design : - Case/Control ; Observational - Planned statistical analysis : Risk association genotype cancer/survival assess use unconditional logistic regression model , covariate adjustment , appropriate . - Number subject enrol : Target accrual 6000 subject , consist 450 cases/each gender African Americans 800 cases/each gender Caucasians . An equal number control select category case base combination gender race . - For patient undergo low dose CT screen participate hospital protocol , enroll patient `` positive '' scan attend either UMMS VA hospital follow .</detailed_description>
