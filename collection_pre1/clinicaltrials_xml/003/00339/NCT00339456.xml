Absolute CD4+ Tcell count great equal 125/mm ( 3 ) within 30 day randomization ( For patient status postsplenectomy , also CD4+ Tcell great 20 % ) . If CD4+ T cell count less equal 200 cells/mm ( 3 ) , patient must receive PCP prophylaxis . Receiving least 3drug HAART recent viral load test prior screen less 500 copies/ml . Patients must receive 3 drug HAART contain NNRTI , abacavir PI least 90 day prior enrollment least 1 PI efavirenz 30 day prior enrollment . A viral load le 50 copies/ml prior enrollment . Age least 18 year . For woman childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) require within 14 day prior randomization . Laboratory value ( within 30 day prior randomization ) : 1 . AST 5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) . 2 . Total direct bilirubin 2 X ULN unless pattern consistent Gilbert syndrome patient receive indinavir . 3 . Creatinine 2.0 mg/dL . 4 . Platelet count least 50,000/microliters . Written consent participate trial . Patient financially capable purchase drug uninterrupted least 72 week ( duration study ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Concurrent malignancy , disease state , require cytotoxic chemotherapy . Symptomatic significant HIVrelated illness , opportunistic infection malignancy mucocutaneous Kaposi sarcoma . A history AIDS defining opportunistic infection mucocutaneous Kaposi sarcoma candida treat tuberculosis . Use experimental antiretroviral less equal 6 month prior enrollment . An exception may make hydroxeurea accord judgment Principal Investigator . Pregnancy breastfeed . Significant cardiac , pulmonary , kidney , rheumatologic , gastrointestinal , CNS disease detectable routine history , physical examination , screen laboratory study .

Active substance abuse history prior substance abuse may interfere protocol compliance compromise patient safety . Refusal practice safe sex use precaution pregnancy ( effective birth control barrier contraceptive abstinence ) . Known history laboratory evidence chronic hepatitis B infection include surface antigen positivity . Receiving salvage HAART , i.e . evidence clinical resistance license antiretrovirals indicate clinical progression , elevate viral load decline CD4+ T cell count receive antiretroviral therapy , receive suboptimal antiretroviral therapy prior HAART . Patients currently receive nevirapine abacavir exclude .</criteria>
