	<brief_summary>This study , conduct National Cancer Institute University Oklahoma , look change cervix cell sample may sign cervical disease . Human papilloma virus , HPV , common infection genitalia woman usually go away . If HPV infection go away , might turn cancer cervix , although rare . This study examine many HPV infection go away persist lead cervical cancer . Women 18 year age old refer colposcopy ( examination vagina cervix use instrument magnify lens ) University Oklahoma follow Pap smear diagnosis may eligible study . Women one follow diagnostic category : - Cancer : Stage 1-2 . - Precancer : Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN3 ) . - HPV-infected : Positive 13 know cancer-causing HPV type , diagnose cancer CIN3 . - Normal : Negative cancer-causing HPV normal tissue laboratory result . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Questionnaire : Covers demographic information ( age , race , ethnicity , marital status , etc . ) , pregnancy history , menstrual sexual history , contraceptive history , hormone medication history , medical history , smoke history , physical development , family history , health care access . - Blood test : 2 tablespoon blood drawn . - Colposcopy . - Procedure collect sample cervical cell fluid HPV test research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For past twenty year , large epidemiologic natural history study play crucial role achieve current understanding cervical neoplasia . We know human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection necessary sufficient cause cervical cancer . Cervical pathogenesis evolve follow : normal 'yields ' oncogenic HPV infection 'yields ' precancer 'yields ' invasive cancer . The majority woman oncogenic HPV infection develop cancer , HPV infection , even associate cellular change , regress 1-2 year , probably eradicate control cellular immune response . Morevoer , invasive cancer precancer histologically welldefined , histological classification low-grade lesion , well define HPV infection , heterogeneous poorly reproducible . Identifying woman high risk cancer prior neoplastic progression therefore challenge . At present , unable predict accuracy HPV infection progress among majority regress . Currently , cytologic , histologic , extent , HPV DNA assay basis triage , treatment , follow-up . While approach permit successful cervical cancer prevention effort , million woman diagnose year HPV infection , inability distinguish progress regress , many woman over-treated result . It therefore etiologic interest public health benefit develop method identify HPV-infected woman risk progress precancer invasion . To develop accurate reproducible division precursor lesion ( HPV infection precancer ) require gain knowledge molecular distinction progressive disease state . Our goal therefore comprehensively assess biomarkers risk progressive cervical neoplasia , thus develop new set biomarkers distinguish high risk cervical cancer benign infection . Specifically , initially implement cross-sectional study develop comprehensive list potential risk biomarkers examine cervical tissue woman normal , HPV infection , precancer , cancer . They measure gene expression profile gain accurate comprehensive vivo picture cervical neoplasia carcinogenesis . We propose validate promising identify candidate biomarkers prospective design assess predictive value key outcomes related progression ( HPV persistence , diagnosis precancer ) non-progression ( HPV clearance ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All woman refer cervical colposcopy University Oklahoma consider eligible study . These woman categorize four group : ( ) cancer , ( ii ) precancer , ( iii ) HPVinfected , ( iv ) normal . Cancers limit woman diagnose early cancer ( Stage 12 ) minimize potential disease effect . Precancers define woman diagnose histologically cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 ( CIN3 ) . This highly specific wellreproduced diagnosis effectively represent carcinoma situ . All woman test DNA positive 13 know oncogenic HPV type ( HPVinfected ) , diagnose CIN3 cancer ( stage ) place HPVpositive group . This group therefore encompass HPVinfected woman diagnose either cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 ( CIN1 ) , CIN2 , low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion ( LSIL ) , atypical squamous cell undetermined significance ( ASCUS ) , atypical glandular cell underdetermined significance ( AGUS ) , find cytologically normal . Women refer colposcopy clinic find negative oncogenic HPV normal upon histological diagnosis eligible normal control ; approach ethical method collect biopsy essentially `` normal '' woman many benign `` look alike '' condition rule colposcopy clinic . While group may random sample general population , use specimen woman control ensure group woman truly confirm neoplasia . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Women attend clinic solely vaginal colposcopies exclude study . Women 18 year age pregnant visit also exclude study . In addition , woman prior treatment ( woman come clinic followup visit subsequent treatment ( woman come clinic followup visit subsequent treatment woman come initial clinic visit follow pretreatment chemotherapy radiation ) exclude . All woman know HIV AIDS exclude study . This information readily available unless woman previously see University Oklahoma clinic . This event consider rare ; recent study HIV AIDS University Oklahoma population terminate due lack HIV/AIDS detect population .</criteria>
