	<brief_summary>This study , conduct jointly National Cancer Institute Kaiser Permanente Center Health Research Northwest ( KPCHRN ) Portland , Oregon , lay groundwork future study identify precursor endometrial cancer ; , condition precede development cancer line uterus . The diagnosis endometrial hyperplasia ( condition abnormal proliferation endometrial tissue ) include precursor endometrial cancer , well many benign condition . Currently , three method classify endometrial cancer precursor suggest base endometrial hyperplasia finding , know classification best predicts cancer risk . This study examine surgical specimen hyperplasia cancer woman diagnose endometrial cancer least 2 year diagnosis endometrial hyperplasia . Investigators estimate percentage case different degree hyperplasia , assess subsequent cancer develop . This allow rank hyperplasia lesion accord cancer risk identify lesion represent immediate cancer precursor . They also review patient medical chart information relate cancer risk treatment . Study participant include woman enrol KPCHRN 40 year age old diagnose endometrial cancer least 2 year diagnose endometrial hyperplasia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Three system propose classify endometrial carcinoma precursor , currently unclear system best predict cancer risk reproducible . The optimal surrogate endpoint endometrial carcinoma therefore unknown . The pathologic diagnosis endometrial hyperplasia ( EH ) include suspected immediate precursor many mild , highly reversible proliferation . We propose exploratory study assess feasibility investigate EH source endometrial carcinoma surrogate endpoint . We conduct nest case-control study within large , population-based health care plan . We identify case , define woman diagnose EH least one year diagnose endometrial carcinoma severe atypical hyperplasia hysterectomy , computerize search plan databases . We retrieve slide match biopsy hysterectomy carcinoma diagnose . Women age 40 old plan member receive biopsy curettage diagnosis EH 1970 2002 eligible case . We perform initial histologic review case index biopsy slide assess two type misclassification know affect diagnosis EH : ) false-negative endometrial carcinoma ( i.e. , prevalent carcinoma time EH diagnosis ) b ) false-positive EH ( i.e. , benign , non-hyperplastic lesion ) . From case physical record link computer record , collect data histopathologic classification EH lesion subsequent carcinoma ; descriptive data ( e.g. , patient weight , parity , menopausal status ) ; summary relevant treatment follow-up procedure ( e.g. , hormone therapy additional clinical procedure ) . We select control , define woman diagnose EH develop endometrial carcinoma undergo hysterectomy follow-up interval equivalent follow-up interval case . Controls individually match case age EH diagnosis , date EH diagnosis , duration follow-up , also counter-matched base original EH diagnosis . After select 3 control per case , assemble data control : histologic review original slide , descriptive data medical record database , treatment follow-up procedure data link database . These data use estimate cancer risk associate specific EH classification , identify patient clinical factor might modify risk , explore predictor EH , explore molecular factor might influence probability develop carcinoma diagnosis EH .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All woman member KPNW health plan 1970 2003 risk develop endometrial carcinoma eligible . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Women consider ineligible substantial gap KPNW coverage year index biopsy diagnosis date ( case ) censor date ( control ) . NCI KPNW review otherwise eligible woman coverage gap identify substantial gap determine eligibility individual basis .</criteria>
