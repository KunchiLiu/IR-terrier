	<brief_summary>This study analyze blood sample identify substance associate development breast cancer . It determine : - Women diagnose benign breast condition relate considerably increase risk breast cancer likely certain gene variant woman diagnose condition related little increased breast cancer risk - Women benign breast condition subsequently develop breast cancer likely certain gene variant woman similar benign condition develop breast cancer . This study examine blood sample premenopausal woman underwent breast biopsy ( removal small piece breast tissue microscopic examination ) four hospital Grand Rapids , MI , 1977 1987 find benign breast disease . The woman , agree participate study marker breast cancer , also provide blood sample interview information breast cancer risk factor , family history breast cancer , use medication , history medical condition . This study retrieve biopsy report woman , determine later develop breast cancer , perform genotyping blood sample . The information study may help future diagnosis treatment breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prevention treatment intraepithelial neoplasia benign pre-malignant condition become important focus NCI 's 2015 goal eliminate suffer death due cancer , although little known factor influence development frank malignancy high risk benign/precursor condition . The Radiation Epidemiology Biostatistics Branches NCI propose evaluate contribution inherit genetic variation benign pre-malignant breast condition , subsequent breast cancer risk woman diagnose condition , Breast Cancer Serum Bank , unique biospecimen resource house NCI since 1995 . Premenopausal participant ( N=2632 ) biopsied average age 27 1977-1987 , ( many diagnose high risk benign breast condition ( moderate/florid breast hyperplasia atypia ) ) interview provide blood sample . Participant biopsy report obtain review recoding , participant trace vital status breast cancer development ( expect n = 240 case ) . Variants gene relate hormone metabolism cell signal , process implicate development premalignant breast condition , gene associate cell cycle control apoptosis , thus possibly related progression breast cancer among woman premalignant breast condition assess NCI Central Genotyping Facility . We remarkable opportunity study address scientific question regard breast carcinogenesis mechanism relatively little cost . Greater comprehension influence inherit factor distinct step biological pathway , first normal tissue benign high risk breast tumor , hence breast cancer , contribute understand molecular mechanism shape breast cancer development , hold promise discovery delivery sound risk-adapted intervention woman high risk premalignant condition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Potentially eligible premenopausal woman include 2636 previous concurrent ( within 60 day ) diagnosis breast cancer time initial benign breast biopsy ( study entry ) least 4 mls serum store Frederick biorepository . Of 2636 , four woman code indicate `` refuse study '' `` followup '' variable , despite evidence consent original study , omit future use study data specimen . Participants also require Caucasian African American ( 2599 98.6 % ) , pathology report successfully retrieve participate hospital review . All sample size subsequently cite text take inclusion criterion account , cite objective 2 also incorporate adjustment loss followup .</criteria>
