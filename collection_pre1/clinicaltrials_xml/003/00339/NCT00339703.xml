	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether serum resistin level asthmatic elevate . We recruit subject allergy/immunology clinic prior diagnosis moderate severe persistent asthma addition subject see evaluation drug allergy . Based inclusion exclusion criterion , subject place control asthma group . Each subject undergo one blood draw main lab WHMC , return lavender top tube allergy/immunology clinic EIA resistin assay . The patient brief encounter physician determine date history asthma symptom prior participate exhale NO test . The entire subject encounter take place one clinic visit , require follow visit part study . The great risk subject blood draw , exhale NO completely non-invasive test . Plasma subject store –70° freezer one month . Samples analyze resistin level use EIA assay run monthly . Mean value serum CRP , serum glucose , serum resistin , exhale NO compare use student T-test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Resistin part FIZZ ( find inflammatory zone ) family gene , first characterize murine model extensively study potential link type II diabetes obesity . The murine FIZZ gene family consist three relate gene product : ) FIZZ-1 Relm-a found adipocytes lung tissue , b ) FIZZ-2 Relm-b find gastrointestinal tract , c ) FIZZ-3 Resistin also find adipocytes.1 Mouse model show resistin link obesity insulin resistance , thiazolidinedione show decrease resistin expression mouse adipocytes.2 Distribution FIZZ gene product human similar mouse model : ) Relm-a find adipose , heart , lung , b ) Relm-b find gastrointestinal tract , c ) Resistin find adipocytes interestingly , also find circulate macrophages.3 Given finding correlate obesity diabetes mouse model , several study do human attempt illustrate link . A study compare middle age type II diabetic match control find serum resistin level increase diabetic group ( 16.6 v 13.5 , p &lt; 0.004 ) , elevation independent adiposity , BMI , insulin resistance . Elevation C-reactive protein ( CRP ) diabetic group factor consistently correlate elevation resistin level study.4 A second study compare old ( 60-75 year age ) type II diabetic also find significant elevation serum resistin diabetic group independent gender , insulin resistance , BMI , blood pressure , total cholesterol . Interestingly , study find association plasma glucose concentration serum resistin levels.5 Although seem direct link resistin insulin resistance human , data suggest role insulin systemic inflammation commonly associate diabetes . Adipocytes know source inflammatory cytokine TNF-a IL-6 . TNF-a show elevated obesity , many acute phase reactant cytokine associate diabetes metabolic syndrome.6 In addition , resistin show induce VCAM-1 , ICAM-1 , long pentraxin 3 ( marker vascular inflammation ) mouse model . The resistin related induction VCAM-1 partially block statin , indicate role resistin vascular inflammation may contribute atherosclerosis coronary artery disease see diabetic metabolic syndrome.7 Given effect vascular inflammation , resistin may important cytokine involved common inflammatory pathway see diabetic asthmatic . Like diabetes , asthma disease mark chronic inflammation . The inflammation associate asthma predominantly illustrate airway , however , study show induced bronchoconstriction asthma illicit systemic response elevation CRP think mediate IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-a via activate macrophages.8,9 In addition , CCL2 contribute airway hyper-reactivity cell migration , thiazolidinedione show inhibit IL-1b TNF-a induced expression CCL2 lung.10 Finally , recent study illustrate IL-4 IL-13 induction Relm-b via STAT-6 response allergic asthma.11 The level serum resistin human asthmatic currently unknown , may represent important systemic marker inflammation disease . Relating level serum resistin disease state conjunction measurement serum CRP glucose would important aspect understanding potential systemic inflammatory implication asthma . In addition , unpublished data exhale NO show positive correlation asthma could use strengthen evidence systemic inflammation airway inflammation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion asthmatic group consist follow : ( ) male nonpregnant female , ( b ) 1865 year age , ( c ) asthma define moderate severe persistent NHLBI guideline , characterize least daily symptom , night symptom least weekly , FEV1 6080 % predict . Newly diagnose asthmatic , poorly control asthmatic , hospitalize patient asthma flare may also consider separate arm study . Inclusion criterion control group consist follow : ( ) male nonpregnant female , ( b ) 1865 year age . Exlusion criterion asthmatic group consist follow : ( ) current use oral steroid statin , ( b ) serious concurrent disease process , limited diabetes , coronary artery disease , vasculitis , would effect level systemic inflammation . Exclusion criterion control group consist follow : ( ) current use oral steroid statin , ( b ) prior diagnosis asthma , clinical symptom consistent asthma reactive airway disease , ( c ) serious concurrent disease process , limited diabetes , coronary artery disease , vasculitis , would effect level systemic inflammation .</criteria>
