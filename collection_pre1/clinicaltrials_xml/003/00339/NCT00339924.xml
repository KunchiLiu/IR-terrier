	<brief_summary>This study develop survey instrument measure primary care physician ' knowledge variation human genetics , belief biologic genetic difference accord patient ' race ethnicity , knowledge use clinical decision making . Genomics research today primary care physicians responsible translate new genetic knowledge , drug therapy , single multiplex genetic test clinical practice . Physicians board certify general internist , include practice teach research teach hospital urban area United States , may eligible study . Participants recruit invitation information letter mail leader local chapter physician organization , letter e-mail sent qualify general internist database , e-mail sent academic physician practice teach medicine medical school meet inclusion criterion . The number participant estimate 96 first phase study . The researcher especially interested general internist provide general preventative health care service patient various racial , ethnic , ancestral background . This study use qualitative methods-focus group semistructured interviews-and quantitative method . Two pilot focus group session , eight member , plan Washington , D.C. Other setting study Atlanta , Detroit , Los Angeles , Philadelphia . Those location select base population density , availability several teach hospital diverse patient population , availability physician meeting study requirement , need address important region nationwide . The focus group separate region self-identified race-for example , one group consist African American internist Atlanta another white internist Atlanta . The facilitator general internist race . Each focus group session , last 90 minute , audiotaped transcribed verbatim . Data focus group analyze theme phrase , scale develop assess response . Then scale review two panel expert . One panel expert genetics human genetic variation , social scientist survey researcher expert develop survey . For semistructured interview , two physician participate give focus group invite participate , base engagement discussion interest project . This face-to-face interview 60 90 minute . A total 32 interview conduct . After scale revise , second pilot study do . For study , 3,500 primary care physician invite participate web-based survey use scale . It anticipate sufficient sample size examine property scale . The propose timetable study 2 year . Benefits participate study include participant ' increase understanding human genetic variation awareness physician understand use race ethnicity practice medicine . Also , information gain useful improve physician ' training . There compensation participation . Each physician receive $ 150 , participate focus group semistructured interview receive $ 150 session .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In recognition emerge social scientific research related assessing complex relationship self-identified race , ancestral origin genetic component disease , important study physician health professional knowledge human genetic variation interpret apply race , ethnicity human genetic variation clinical decision making . Primary care physicians responsible translation new genomic knowledge , include use pharmacogenomic multiplex genetic test clinical practice . Understanding health professional knowledge , beliefs practice provide important data further health service research . The Physicians Understanding Human Genetic Variation study ( PUHGV ) three-phase , mixed-method study use qualitative ( focus group semi-structured interview ) quantitative method ( web-based survey ) . The first phase study use qualitative method investigate racial ethnic difference physician understand use genetics , race ethnicity practice assist develop Health Professionals Genetic Education Needs Exploration survey instrument ( HP GENE ) . Bonham Sellers develop pilot Human Genetic Variation-Health Professionals Knowledge , Beliefs , Use Scales ( HGV-HP ) measure physicians knowledge human genetic variation ( HGV-HP Knowledge ) , beliefs biologic genetic difference base upon patient race ethnicity ( HGV-HP Beliefs ) , use construct clinical decision making approach ( HGV-HP Use ) . The HGV-HP Scales component large HP GENE survey instrument . The second phase study pilot instrument random sample United States general internist diverse racial ethnic background geographic area United States assess psychometric property scale investigate role incentive recruit physician participate web survey . Informed pilot test instrument , third phase study conduct national survey use instrument scale health professional different health discipline .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The population interest phase study currently practice , board certify general internist , allopathic osteopathic , whose office United States . Investigators select population multiple reason . General internist frontlines health care delivery become increasingly responsible translation genomic knowledge clinical practice . Further , select general internist phase study consistent population include Phases I II study . Lastly , limit pool potential respondent general internist help minimize cost associate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : We exclude physician address outside continental United States , well , physician active practice ( see patient &lt; 10 % time ) , decease , retired prior randomly select sample . Because question surround clinical decision make key component survey , imperative include practice physician sample .</criteria>
