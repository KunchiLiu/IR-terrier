	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Korle-Bu Hospital Accra , Ghana , help elucidate role lifestyle genetic factor prostate cancer risk . There strong variation risk prostate cancer throughout world . The rate disease among African Americans world high . In United States , incidence prostate cancer 70 percent high African Americans white Americans death rate African Americans almost double white Americans . The reason excessive risk unknown , genetic lifestyle factor suggest . Because Africans African Americans share similar genetic ancestry vastly different lifestyle , good understand rate risk factor profile prostate cancer among Africans provide important clue cause disease . This study try assess incidence prostate cancer West African nation Ghana . The study two component : - Clinical survey The method diagnosis Korle-Bu evaluate incidence prostate cancer 5-year period estimate . - Screening detection survey A survey 1,000 men 50 74 year age estimate prevalence asymptomatic undiagnosed symptomatic prostate cancer Accra population . The clinical survey use data cancer logbook medical record Korle-Bu Hospital Ghanaian National Census derive estimate prostate cancer incidence within Accra . The estimate low , since base men diagnose treated Korle-Bu include men asymptomatic disease , men diagnose elsewhere , men without access medical care . The screen detection survey assess presence asymptomatic unrecognized symptomatic prostate cancer use PSA test digital rectal examination random sample 1,000 men general population Accra . This provide high estimate disease prevalence . The two estimate provide approximation true incidence rate disease Accra . Comparison data similar data community survey African Americans provide insight reason excess risk prostate cancer African Americans .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The key aim study assess burden prostate cancer Ghana evaluate impact prostate cancer among West Africans compare among African Americans , whose report incidence rate among high world . West Africans African Americans share genetic ancestry different lifestyle environmental exposure . The study aim achieve establish low upper bound true incidence prostate cancer capital city Accra . The secondary aim study establish epidemiological , biochemical , genetic profile West Africans comparison African Americans provide etiologic clue prostate cancer . DESIGN : The study consist two component : 1. clinical survey , 1. divide five-year retrospective , 2. 3-year prospective phase , 2. population screen survey .</detailed_description>
