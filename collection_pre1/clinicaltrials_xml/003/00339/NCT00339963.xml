	<brief_summary>This study use genomics-based technology , DNA microarrays , precisely diagnose subset lymphoma , leukemia multiple myeloma patient . There many attempt classify lymphoid cancer way useful clinical diagnosis treatment . Although broad diagnostic category reliably define , patient within category distinct clinical course , suggest classification could divide molecular ( genetic ) subtypes . For example , 40 percent patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma achieve long-term disease remission follow combination chemotherapy apparently cure , whereas remain 60 percent die disease . Similarly , patient follicular lymphoma develop aggressive disease within year diagnosis , others stable disease 10 20 year . Although distinction clinical course disease recognize , study determine molecular ( genetic ) basis variability . This study try define new molecular diagnostic category diseases correlate clinical feature , include treatment response , disease remission overall survival follow chemotherapy . This retrospective study use clinical data tissue sample participate center Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project LLMPP ) . New patient recruit study . Biopsy material , include fresh frozen OTC-embedded lymphoma biopsy material , viably frozen sample peripheral blood cell leukemia patient , viably frozen sample bone marrow aspirate multiple myeloma patient collected pathologist participate LLMPP . RNA genomic DNA extract tumor sample . A variety technology use characterize genome cancer cell , include lymphochip microarrays array-based comparative genomic hybridization ; Southern blot PCR translocation gene previously implicate malignancy ; PCR DNA sequence method analyze base change genome cancer cell . Clinical information initial diagnosis disease relapse take exist database and/or patient chart . Gene expression correlate clinical data . If small number gene find strongly predict clinical outcome , quantitative RT-PCR assay use Taqman technology may develop alternative DNA microarray analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Current diagnosis lymphoid malignancy rely upon morphological appearance cancer cell supplement molecular marker . Within diagnostic category , clinical course responses patient therapy variable , suggest exist diagnostic category may harbor one disease entity . Recent genomic technology allow comprehensive molecular analysis expression genome cancer cell . DNA microarray analysis gene expression lymphoma reveal distinct molecular subtypes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma new molecularly-defined lymphoma subtypes divergent clinical outcome . To extend genomic analysis lymphoid malignancy , form consortium cooperate institution term Lymphoma/Leukemia Molecular Profiling Project ( LLMPP ) . The clinical center participate LLMPP send de-identified lymphoma , leukemia multiple myeloma sample NCI gene expression profiling , array-based comparative genomic hybridization cancer gene resequencing . An additional site , The National Cancer Center Singapore , send de-identified sample tumor tissue patient lymphoma . Objective : Assess gene expression genomic scale lymphoma , leukemia multiple myeloma sample relationship somatic genetic alteration . Eligibility : Diagnosis lymphoid malignancy one LLMPP participate institution , include specimen originate clinical site submit LLMPP participate sit The National Cancer Center Singapore . Design : This entirely retrospective study . All tumor biopsy contain malignant cell analyze obtain previously patient diagnose and/or treat one institution participate LLMPP The National Cancer Center Singapore . Clinical data also send patient study purpose correlate gene expression measurement clinical outcome . The goal effort define new molecular diagnostic category diseases clinically relevant gain new insight molecular pathway active malignancy . The home institution provide clinical data tissue sample obtain local approval clinical research committee study .</detailed_description>
