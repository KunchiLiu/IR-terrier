	<brief_summary>This study create database clinical biological research use future study , information obtain lung transplant recipient . The database consist genetic material clinical outcome use future genotyping study , , study regard genetic makeup individual . Lung transplantation become important option patient advance lung disease . More 10,000 patient received date , 1,200 transplant operation perform worldwide year . Although short-term survival continue improve , 5-year survival rate le 50 percent . Most post transplant death directly directly cause chronic lung rejection , condition scar worsens lung function . Patients evaluate lung transplant Duke University Medical Center may eligible study . For develop database , small amount blood , 3 tablespoon , collect patient . Blood collection research do time blood drawn necessary test . The blood cell DNA ( contain genetic material ) isolate analysis . Patients ' DNA sample collect identified code , identify information remove . Patients may ask donate additional blood sample lung transplant researcher would like reexamine blood . This study direct benefit participant . However , study , find patient inherit risk disease likely cause early death disease treat , researcher attempt notify patient . Overall , hop information gain study help medical professional learn immune activation see reactivity lung transplant patient change time . If specific genetic risk could identify , might lead individualized treatment work immune system . Short-term long-term survival lung transplant recipient may thus improve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lung transplantation emerge viable therapeutic option care patient advance pulmonary parenchymal pulmonary vascular disease . Currently , 10,000 patient receive lung transplantation approximately 1200 transplant operation perform worldwide year . Short-term survival lung transplantation continue improve since widespread application procedure one-year survival center approach 80 % . Unfortunately , long-term outcome lung transplantation disappoint five-year survival 50 % . Most posttransplant death due directly indirectly development acute chronic rejection . Acute rejection define presence perivascular mononuclear inflammatory cell . Obliterative bronchiolitis ( OB ) describe fibrosis obliteration small medium size bronchiole , histological manifestation chronic lung rejection . Bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome ( BOS ) think correlate development histological OB cause allograft dysfunction exclude . The diagnosis OB base primarily decline spirometry exclusion alternative diagnosis bronchoscopy biopsy , i.e . development clinical BOS . Since introduction BOS nomenclature , numerous study validate clinical prognostic importance syndrome verify correlation histological OB . Chronic rejection describe histological pattern fibrous obliteration endothelial epithelial structure allograft . A similar pattern histological fibrosis observe type solid organ transplant ( e.g. , obliterative arteriopathy heart transplant , BOS lung transplant ) , occur despite use currently available , primarily T-cell base , immune suppression . The rate chronic rejection vary considerably type organ transplant . By five year transplantation histological fibrosis occur approximately 20 % kidney , 40 % heart 60-80 % lung recipient . Thus , lung transplantation characterize unusually high incidence chronic graft rejection manifest BOS . Because high rate acute chronic lung transplant rejection , research design well correlate clinical outcome genetic risk rejection critical improving patient outcomes . We recently complete study demonstrate two single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) Asp299Gly Thr399Ile ( polymorphisms human Toll 4 gene associate endotoxin hyporesponsiveness ) associate decreased acute rejection lung transplantation . We hypothesize SNPs associate either increase decreased innate adaptive immune activation critical determine clinical outcome regard acute chronic rejection lung transplant . If specific genetic risk rejection transplant could identify , might lead highly tailored immunosuppressive regimen improve clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
