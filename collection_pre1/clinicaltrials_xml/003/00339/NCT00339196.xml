	<detailed_description>Chromatin Demethylation Apart histone acetylation deacetylation , promoter hypermethylation another important relevant mechanism involve gene transcription regulation ( review Herman , 2003 ) . Chromatin remodel might thus also target use nucleoside analogue , 5 azacytidine decitabine , reactivate gene transcription DNA demethylation ( Silverman , 2001 ) . Recently , VITRO study , induction gene expression 5 AzaC obtain primary AML MDS cell DNA methylation dependent independent mechanism ( SCHMELZ , 2005 ) Again , AzaC demonstrate capable induce clinical hematological response patient MDS . A control study conduct US Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALBG ) report high response rate , low incidence leukemic transformation prolong survival compare supportive care alone patient Silverman , 2002 . Another confirmatory Phase 3 study ongoing . AzaC , combination valproic acid , leukemic cell line ( HL60 MOLT4 , demonstrate synergistic activity induce gene reexpression ( reactivation p21 CIP1 ) synergistic effect term growth inhibition , induction apoptosis ( Yang H , 2005 ) . Histone Acetylation Numerous investigator group try elucidate molecular mechanism underlie ATRA induced differentiation NB4 cell , fresh APL cell , APL mouse , APL patient ( Melnick 1999 ) . One main issue understand crucial role PML RARα fusion protein differentiation response RA . It observe first therapeutic concentration ATRA result reformation PML nuclear body associate cleavage PML RARα fusion protein . Disappearance fusion product act dominant negative regulator RA target gene transcription give explanation rerun differentiation process . The dominant negative role PML RARα secondly explain association fusion protein N-CoR-SMRT-Sin3 corepressor complex , lead histone deacetylase ( HDAC ) activity recruitment lack target gene transcription ( REDNER , 1999 ) . Of interest , similar recruitment corepressor HDAC activity report fusion gene leukemia , include PLZF RARα , AML1 ETO , CBFß MYH11 , TEL AML1 acute leukemia . In PML RARα APL cell , therapeutic concentration ATRA allow release corepressor HDAC activity , histone acetylation , chromatin remodeling , transcription target gene potentially responsible terminal granulocytic differentiation ( REDNER , 1999 ; DILWORK , 2001 ) . From point view , ATRA therapy APL first example gene target therapy specifically target pathogenic genetic abnormality human leukemia . In VITRO vivo resistance ATRA-induced differentiation observe patient PLZF RARα leukemia relate potent recruitment corepressor HDAC activity APL subset , compare classical PML- RARα APL ( two corepressor bind site PLZF instead one PML ) . Very interestingly , recently demonstrate PLZF RARα leukemic cell actually completely resistant differentiation induction , especially appropriate COSTIMULI give . First , cell differentiate presence high concentration ATRA ( 3 microM instead 1 microM ) . Secondly addition HDAC inhibitor ( trichostatin A ) restore ATRA sensitivity 1 microM ( KITAMURY 2000 ) . Thirdly G CSF signal may force cell undergo terminal differentiation ( JANSEN 2001 ) . HDAC inhibitor also show able induce remission transgenic model therapy resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia ( He 2001 ) . The sensitivity HL60 cell , display chromosomal rearrangement involve RARα locus , RA induce differentiation may relate observation . One may hypothesize unknown COSTIMULI include chromatin remodel event contribute RA sensitivity HL60 cell . From therapeutic point view , observation lead evaluate non target transcriptional therapy combine ATRA non target HDAC inhibitor and/or cAMP inducer non APL leukemia . Among known HDAC inhibitor ( trichostatin A , trapoxin A , butyrate , oxamflatin , depsipeptide , MS 275 ) , sodium phenylbutyrate successfully administer combination ATRA patient clinically ATRA resistant APL ( WARRELL , 1998 ) . This case report represent first example target transcriptional therapy human leukemia . It recently demonstrate valproic acid ( VPA ) belong HDAC inhibitor family ( PHIEL , 2001 ) . Valproic acid short chain fatty acid widely use anticonvulsant mood stabilizer . The characteristic delay response VPA teratogenic potential lead long time proposal act modulation gene expression . It also report VPA activate AP1-dependent transcription ( ASGHARI , 1998 ; Chen , 1999 1 ; Yuan , 2001 ) upregulate bcl 2 ( Chen , 1999 2 ) . VPA also recently demonstrate capable induce differentiation F9 teratocarcinoma cell , know also capable differentiate presence RA cAMP ( WERLING , 2001 ) . Finally , VPA might sensitize neoplastic cell pro apoptotic stimulus inhibition glutathione ( GSH ) reductase , enzyme require maintain high cellular level reduce GSH ( Moog , 1996 ) , inhibition NF-κB pathway ( ICHIYAMA , 2000 ) . Interestingly , also show lithium chloride ( another mood stabilizer ) act synergistically ATRA induce terminal differentiation WEHI-3B leukemia cell . As observed combination ATRA G CSF , observe synergism appear related prevention RAR protein loss usually observe ATRA exposure ( Finch , 2000 ) . Of interest , VPA single agent administer combination ATRA recently demonstrate capable induce clinical hematological response patient treat myelodysplastic syndrome ( KUENDGEN , 2004 ) . In study , pretreatment VA seem require positive effect ATRA . Retinoic Acid : Retinoids represent large group compound structurally relate vitamin A ( retinol ) . They act bind activate specific nuclear receptor , bind DNA . Retinoic acid ( RA ) , natural acidic derivative retinol , key differentiate factor involve specific phase embryonic development , differentiation visual system , ( interest ) hemopoietic granulocytic maturation ( CORNIC , 1994 ) . In VITRO , RA demonstrate capable induce granulocytic differentiation HL60 cell line . This cell line establish 1977 patient AML . The cell largely resemble promyelocytes induce differentiate terminally . Some reagent , include RA , cause HL60 cell differentiate granulocyte-like cell , others monocyte/macrophage-like cell . The HL60 cell genome contains amplify c-myc proto-oncogene c-myc mRNA level decline rapidly follow induction differentiation ( BIRNIE , 1988 ) . Recurrent alteration gene cod RA alpha receptor ( RARα , locate chromosome 17q12 ) associate acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) subset . The common RARα gene alteration reciprocal ( 15 ; 17 ) chromosomal translocation observe vast majority acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) correspond AML-M3 subset French-American-British ( FAB ) classification . This translocation fuse RARα gene PML gene ( locate chromosome 15q21 ) , result PML- RARα fusion product . Variant translocation fuse RARα gene partner include PLZF chromosome 11 , NPM chromosome 5 , NuMA chromosome 11 , STAT5 chromosome 17 , rarely occasionally report . The causal role RARα fusion protein ( least PML- RARα PLZF- RARα ) APL demonstrate murine model ( KOGAN , 1999 ) . It show fusion protein may act dominant transcriptional repressor APL cell ( Melnick , 1999 ) . The NB4 cell line establish 1991 patient APL ( LANOTTE , 1991 ) . This cell line widely use study biology disease . Conversely HL60 , NB4 carry ( 15 ; 17 ) translocation . As HL60 cell , RA capable induce granulocytic differentiation NB4 cell lead cell death terminal induction apoptosis . These differentiate effect confirm vivo use different murine model APL ( KOGAN , 1999 ; He , 1999 ) . Based pre-clinical observation , oral all-trans RA ( ATRA ) successfully administer APL patient . In patient relapse APL , front-line therapy ATRA ( 45 mg/m2/day ) induce vivo differentiation leukemic promyelocytes abnormal granulocyte still carry PML- RARα fusion , result approximately 90 % hematological remission 20 % molecular remission rate assess specific PML- RARα RT-PCR negativation ( Huang , 1988 ; CASTAIGNE , 1990 ; DEGOS,1995 ) . This represent first example differentiation therapy human leukemia . Unfortunately , beneficial effect observe patient AML subtypes treat ATRA use similar dosage schedule . Following result obtain relapse APL patient , ATRA evaluate combination chemotherapy front-line treatment newly-diagnosed APL patient . Several controlled trial establish ATRA-chemotherapy combination current standard therapy newly-diagnosed APL . Apparently , best result obtain ATRA chemotherapeutic agent administer simultaneously . Other therapeutic intervention might consider increase RA sensitivity RA-resistant cell . Actually , explanation RA resistance include RA-induced increased expression cytochrome P450 isoforms ( CYPs ) , RA-induced increase expression cytoplasmic RA-binding protein type II ( CRABP-II ) , overexpression P-glycoprotein ( P-gp ) , acquire mutation ligand-binding region RARα gene . Agents interact ATRA metabolism , HIV-1 protease inhibitor ( indinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir ) inhibit CYPs P-gp compete ATRA CRABP-I binding , could enhance induction differentiation RA-resistant cell ( IKEZOE , 2000 ) .</detailed_description>
