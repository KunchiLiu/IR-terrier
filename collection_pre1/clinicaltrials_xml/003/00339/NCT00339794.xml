	<brief_summary>This study , conduct American Academy Family Physicians ( AAFP ) National Human Genome Research Institute , characterize family physician ' attitude practice related genetics complex disorder . As front line care Americans , family medicine central role see new finding genetics lead disease prevention health improvement . The information gain study could useful understand shape dissemination genetic medicine way improve standard primary care practice . Members AAFP randomly select organization 's membership record invite participate two-phase study . The first phase web-based survey AAFP member . In second phase , sub-sample complete survey re-contacted ; half member enrol year-long web-based curriculum relate medical genetics , half choose enroll curriculum . Survey question relate physician ' practice , knowledge , opinion implication genomic medicine . Survey area include family history taking ; opinion future genetics family medicine ; information physician practice ; physician 's skill , attitude knowledge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although evidence base genetic susceptibility marker complex disorder ( e.g. , diabetes , hypertension , obesity ) clinical utility relate genetic test demonstrate , sign suggest genetics become increasingly relevant integrate family medicine . In recognition emerge genomic innovation potential improve primary care practice , American Academy Family Physicians ( AAFP ) , collaboration National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI ) , make genomic medicine topic 2005 Annual Clinical Focus curriculum . The AAFP one large medical organization membership comprise group 56,400 active family physician deliver care broad array practice setting rural urban community around United States , Puerto Rico , Virgin Islands Guam . This study seek take advantage plan AAFP 's clinical focus genomics characterize family physician ' attitude practice related genetics complex disorder . This information could useful understand shape dissemination genetic medicine way improve standard primary care practice . To end , propose conduct two phase research activity . In first phase , web-based survey conduct member AAFP . In second phase , sub-sample complete survey re-contacted ; half member enrol year-long web-based curriculum relate medical genetics , half choose enroll curriculum .</detailed_description>
