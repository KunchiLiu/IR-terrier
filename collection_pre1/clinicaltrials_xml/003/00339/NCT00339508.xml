	<brief_summary>The researcher develop distribute several software package pedigree analysis ( FAST , CASPAR , PedHunter , IIC ) cancer genetics ( oncotree , METREX ) . Users need assistance software want see new feature add often send researcher data file include human data . The information normally cod , researcher access identification people whose information file . Sometimes content file give rise collaboration software developers provider file . Because concern confidentiality medical information increase significantly past year , researcher must apply exemption detailed ethic committee oversight every data set receive . This process cumbersome make difficult assist software user . The amount information require apply exemption also pose barrier collaboration . A full protocol subject data set ethic committee oversight without need individual exemption request , enable researcher assist user software problem collaborate researcher . From January 1 , 2000 , December 15 , 2001 , researcher receive 71 request assistance , 19 include data file . None data file names patient identifier . Of 19 , 8 case researcher send back modify output file . In two eight case , researcher could see result research interest ; one concern human data . In 2 19 case , researcher send back modify input file ; one case , establish collaboration originator file . In sum , request come head customer service , research content . A , however , lead research result collaboration , ethic committee oversight require . Over three-year time frame protocol , researcher anticipate receive data maximum 10,000 individual . They modify software documentation explicitly instruct user make sure data file send name . Should receive file names , delete file ask originator resubmit name encode . Users submit data unencrypted e-mail . The data store password-protected computer National Institutes Health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We develop software package pedigree analysis ( FAST , CASPAR , PedHunter , IIC ) cancer genetics ( oncotrees , METREX ) . The purpose protocol allow u work software problem report may contain human subject data . The data cod , mean link identifier name , possess link decode name . Occasionally assistance lead formal research collaboration . This protocol seek clarify guideline provide assistance user human genetics software establish formal procedure seek IRB approval serendipitous collaboration arise provide assistance . We predict sizes sample disease study data set send u , medical aspect protocol necessarily general . We rely data cod collector data institutional approval protect risk . The scientific aspect investigate problem report hypothesis driven guess problem arise . On engineering side , basic hypothesis : 1 ) software likely contain bug weakness , easily find except others use software 2 ) good way improve functionality software encourage user submit problem report suggestion . This protocol effect since early 2002 . The amendment time set three collaboration , describe Sections 4.6 4.7 4.8 . The protocol quite useful change propose procedure .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA : User Requests : When receive data set problem report and/or new feature request , data set would accept . We would consider data collect . The reason : medical aspect data set irrelevant reason receive data ; respond promptly problem report , get detail data collect ; data never use u research traits study researcher collect data . Collaborations : For collaborative study , would request detail data collect , include evidence approval local ethic board . We would submit NHGRI IRB amendment describe new collaboration . That amendment would necessarily include formal indication collaborate research group permission collect analyze human data present u ( cod summarize format ) . For collaborator United States permission would consist IRBapproved protocol exemption collaborator 's institution . For collaborator outside United States permission would one type agreement currently support NIH Office Human Subjects Research . If see evidence appropriate permission collect data IRB turn propose amendment , would exclude participate propose collaboration . There two circumstance also exclude collaborate analysis data set past may future . One circumstance feel propose data set could possibly give sufficient statistical power detect anything interesting . The circumstance exist collaboration one research group , compete group ask u collaborate also .</criteria>
