	<brief_summary>This study try identify risk factor Kaposi sarcoma , rare skin cancer , understand role KSHV virus development disease . All native-born Italians 21 year age old reside Sicily July 1 , 2002 June 30 , 2005 Kaposi sarcoma relate HIV infection may eligible study . Healthy control subject also enrol . All participant interview childhood , job , habit , medical condition , treatment . They also provide blood sample saliva sample , obtain swish mouthwash 45 second spit container . Blood test two virus KSHV HIV relate Kapsosi sarcoma . The KSHV virus newly discover well understood . In general , positive KSHV test probably mean infection virus occur past , necessarily disease develop . HIV virus cause AIDS . People AIDS high risk Kapsosi sarcoma . Although HIV AIDS rare among old adult Sicily , presence HIV must rule order understand KSHV relate Kapsosi sarcoma . The blood may also use measure immunity ( body defense infection cancer ) genetic study help discover Kapsosi sarcoma occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Persons infect Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus ( KSHV ) risk develop Kaposi sarcoma ( KS ) , risk factor KSHV infection KS follow infection well define . Classical KS ( cKS ) occur without apparent immune deficiency ( AIDS allograft ) . The propose study test specific hypothesis generate new hypothesis risk cKS among person antibody KSHV , risk KSHV seropositivity , risk active KSHV infection , define KSHV viremia viral shed saliva . To , 120 incident case cKS throughout Sicily approximately 1800 person ( 15 % KSHV seropositive ) similar age , sex , community size ask participate providing questionnaire data blood saliva specimen . Residual formalin-fixed , paraffin embed tissue KS skin biopsy available verification diagnosis molecular analysis . Primary hypothesis focus host genetic susceptibility , endogenous clinical condition ( asthma allergy ) , exogenous exposure ( cigarette smoking contact certain plant , water soil ) postulate affect KSHV activation , dissemination , disease induction . The study sufficient statistical power detect factor increase risk KSHV seropositivity 1.5- 2-fold , risk cKS 2- 3-fold , risk KSHV viremia shed 3- 4-fold .</detailed_description>
