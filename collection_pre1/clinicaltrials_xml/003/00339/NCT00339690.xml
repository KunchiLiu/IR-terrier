	<brief_summary>This study determine whether use in-home test kit result decrease dust mite allergen level home child sensitive allergic dust mite . Dust mite allergens come dust mite - microscopic spider-like animal fee house dust . Dust mites common anywhere dust , carpet bed . Some people allergic dust mite allergen may develop asthma live near . People live Research Triangle Park area North Carolina child 5 15 year old dust mite allergy sensitivity may eligible study . Participants must plan remain house least 12 month start study . At least half floor child 's room must carpet . Participants give material reduce dust mite allergens home . Study staff visit participant ' home three time 12-month period ask question home , home cleaning habit , participant ' experience home test kit ( see ) measure dust mite allergen . At visit , staff collect dust sample child 's bedroom , parent ' bedroom , living room . The dust sample analyze laboratory dust mite allergens result give participant end study . Participants also give four home test kit measure dust mite allergen home . At first home visit , staff instruct participant use kit answer question may .

	<brief_title>Dust Mite Allergen Reduction Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sensitization dust mite allergens major risk factor development exacerbation asthma . Asthmatics others dust mite allergy often implement strategy avoid dust mite exposure , lack objective evidence effort successful reduce dust mite population . Recently develop in-home test kit introduce capability monitor effectiveness allergen reduction strategy provide affordable , simple way measure dust mite allergen regular basis . The primary objective study determine use in-home test kit result decrease dust mite allergen level home child sensitive allergic dust mite . A secondary objective determine use in-home test kit result attitudinal and/or behavioral change relate implement maintain dust mite reduction strategy . This study randomize control intervention trial design test efficacy in-home test kit influence behavior reduce dust mite allergen level . Households recruit flyer screen eligibility recruitment call line . Study participant randomly assign treatment control group . The treatment group receive educational material in-home test kit set interval , control group receive educational material alone . Vacuumed dust sample collect delivered NIEHS laboratory ELISA-based measurement dust mite allergen Der f 2 Der p 2 . A questionnaire use collect information home characteristic dust mite reduction attitude behavior . The Precaution Adoption Process Model ( PAPM ) use assess change attitude behavior . Data collect baseline , 6-months , 12-months . The primary statistical analysis measure change allergen concentration baseline month 12 . This change compare two study arm use generalized linear model test null hypothesis difference group . In secondary analysis , data sample location analyze separately changes 0-to-6 6-to-12 month compare treatment control group . Data questionnaire baseline home visit analyze group determine PAPM stag transition . The result study use NIEHS plan future primary secondary asthma prevention trial .</detailed_description>
