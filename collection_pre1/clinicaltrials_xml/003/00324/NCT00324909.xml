	<brief_summary>Autism neurodevelopmental disorder currently affect many 1 166 child United States . Autism consider many permanent condition little hope improvement . Treatment autism center special schooling behavioral therapy ; medical science currently little offer . Recent research discover autistic individual decrease blood flow brain , evidence inflammation brain , increase marker oxidative stress . Multiple independent single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) research study reveal hypoperfusion several area autistic brain , notably temporal region area specifically related language comprehension auditory processing . Several study show diminished blood flow area correlate many clinical feature associate autism include repetitive , self-stimulatory stereotypical behavior , impairment communication , sensory perception , social interaction . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) use clinical success several cerebral hypoperfusion syndrome include cerebral palsy , fetal alcohol syndrome , close head injury , stroke . HBOT compensate decrease blood flow increase oxygen content plasma body tissue even normalize oxygen level ischemic tissue . In addition , animal study show HBOT potent anti-inflammatory effect reduces oxidative stress . Furthermore , recent evidence demonstrate HBOT mobilize stem cell human bone marrow may aid recovery neurodegenerative disease . Based upon finding , hypothesize HBOT improve symptom autistic individual . The purpose study determine HBOT improve clinical outcome child autism . The study also determine HBOT change marker inflammation oxidative stress autistic child .</brief_summary>
