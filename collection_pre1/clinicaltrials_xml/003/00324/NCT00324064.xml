	<brief_title>Sexually Dimorphic Effects GHRH Adult Growth Hormone Testing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Growth hormone deficiency affect disproportionately males female . Although ascertainment bias play role sexual dimorphism , plausible mechanism fully explain difference propose . This investigator initiate study provide currently unavailable data sexual/age difference response GH stimulation test . Data obtain study may provide basis develop appropriate normal range adult GH testing , may provide plausible mechanism enhance hormone responsiveness observe female , may provide data sexual difference GH stimulation may develop . The objective study : 1 . Confirm sexual dimorphism growth hormone responses adult growth hormone test healthy male female subject 2 . Correlate peak Growth Hormone Releasing Hormone ( GHRH ) /arginine induced growth hormone responses G protein level healthy subject patient history childhood GH deficiency 3 . Determine whether sexual dimorphism acquire puberty</detailed_description>
