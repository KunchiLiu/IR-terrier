	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT Telepsychology : Service Delivery Depressed Elderly Veterans 1 . Objective : The immediate objective test hypothesis novel mode geriatric mental health service delivery , use in-home videoconferencing technology ( `` Telepsychology '' ) , effective traditional mode service delivery ( `` Same-Room '' ) treat old adult veteran suffer major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . The ultimate objective help VA develop evaluate strategy provide mental health care elderly veteran live rural area , many minority . 2 . Research Design : This project 4-year prospective , randomize between-groups study compare efficacy intervention geriatric depression deliver via two different mode ( Telepsychology , Same-Room ) . Participants Telepsychology condition receive care home via videophone contact therapist Charleston VA Medical Center ; participant Same-room condition receive care via traditional face-to-face therapy session hold Charleston VA Medical Center . Two-hundred twenty-four ( 224 ) participant recruit primary care mental health clinic within Charleston VA Medical Center catchment area . Treatment administer 8-week period ( active treatment phase ) ; participant follow additional 12-months ( follow-up phase ) ascertain longer-term effect treatment three outcome domain : ( 1 ) clinical outcome : symptom severity social functioning ; ( 2 ) process outcome : patient satisfaction acceptance , treatment credibility , session attendance , treatment adherence , treatment dropout ; ( 3 ) cost-effectiveness . 3 . Methodology : Population Sample : Participants elderly veteran ( N = 224 ) , age 60 , diagnose major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Based previous research local demographic , expect approximately 40 % sample African-American . Types Data : To assess outcome , use measure widely validate clinical evaluation older adult MDD . Measures collect pre-treatment , post-treatment , 3- , 12-month follow-up . Data Analyses Plan : The primary clinical response variable proportion ( % ) patient respond treatment , treatment response define least 50 % improvement baseline post-treatment level GDS ( percent change baseline : [ baseline-post ] /baseline &gt; = 50 % ) . Two approach estimation primary response variable take . The first approach estimate proportion responder ( % responder ) end 8-week active treatment course base total number randomize treatment . This equivalent `` bad case '' analysis premature exit ( response status miss ) treat non-responders . We also estimate proportion responder treatment base complete 8-week treatment course ( complete analysis ) . The second approach use multivariable logistic regression estimate adjust % responder . Finally , conduct range analyse African-American Caucasian subject look differential efficacy , patient preference satisfaction , adherence across racial group . 4 . Findings : Analysis data currently process . 5 . Clinical Relationship : Findings allow improve service delivery access elderly depress veteran . 6 . Impact/Significance : The telepsychology literature undeveloped . The VA make telehealth priority strategy bring quality service veterans rural area . Therefore , research address efficacy mode service delivery acutely need . If Telepsychology efficacy cost-effectiveness demonstrated , future research program development bring specialized mental health service home minority veteran VA community base outpatient clinic . Further , Telepsychology effectiveness empirically establish , proceed research examines range important system issue .
