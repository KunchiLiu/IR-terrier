	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study imatinib mesylate bevacizumab see well work compare imatinib mesylate alone treat patient gastrointestinal stromal tumor spread part body remove surgery . Imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . It yet know whether imatinib mesylate bevacizumab effective imatinib mesylate alone treat gastrointestinal stromal tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Imatinib Mesylate With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether treatment imatinib ( imatinib mesylate ) plus bevacizumab lead improve progression free survival ( PFS ) versus treatment imatinib alone first-line treatment incurable gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GIST ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare response probability ( confirm unconfirmed complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] subset patient measurable disease ) , overall survival , central-review base progression-free survival ( CRb-PFS ) patient treat imatinib bevacizumab versus treat imatinib alone . II . To compare frequency severity toxicity associate imatinib plus bevacizumab versus imatinib alone . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore association soluble vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , VEGF-factor D ( VEGF-D ) , VEGF receptor ( VEGFR ) -1 , VEGFR-2 , angiopoietin-2 ( Ang-2 ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) -AA PDGFR-BB level , positron emission tomography ( PET ) image immunohistochemistry cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A ( p16 ) , VEGF VEGFR , kinase mutation status clinical outcome . II . To explore imatinib pharmacokinetics single nucleotide polymorphism involve adenosine triphospate ( ATP ) -binding cassette , sub-family G ( WHITE ) , member 2 ( ABCG2 ) cytochrome P450 , family 3 , subfamily A , polypeptide 4 ( CYP3A4 ) gene , well gene report influence absorption , distribution , metabolism elimination imatinib . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 10/1/2009 ) : Patients receive imatinib mesylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . ARM II ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 10/1/2009 ) : Patients receive imatinib mesylate PO QD day 1-21 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , every 6 month 2 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
