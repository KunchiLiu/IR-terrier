	<brief_summary>Burns represent one severe dread trauma . Burned traumatized tissue know eschar . The dead eschar , remove , often become heavily contaminate source local and/or systemic infection sepsis . The local inflammation infection destroy healthy surround tissue extend original damage . In order prevent complication , order minimize risk infection , imperative evaluate burn remove offend eschar early possible opportunity . This removal dead tissue term `` debridement '' . The direct debridement method eschar removal surgery . Traditional , conservative non-surgical debridement lengthy process often involve many complication . The objective study evaluate safety enzymatic debriding efficacy Debrase Gel Dressing ( DGD ) hospitalize patient deep partial thickness and/or full thickness thermal burn compare DGD standard care ( SOC ) .</brief_summary>
