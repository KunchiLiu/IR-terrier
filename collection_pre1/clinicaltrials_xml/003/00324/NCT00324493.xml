	<brief_summary>Hemophilia , result deficiency factor VIII IX , common hereditary X-linked bleeding disorder affect 10/100,000 population . About 60-70 % severe disease ( factor level &lt; 1 % ) . This group characterize occurrence frequent spontaneous bleed joint soft tissue . If inadequately treat , result progressive damage joint muscle lead cripple deformity . Close clinical observation patient many year show &gt; 1 % level much less bleeding compare less 1 % . This observation gain immense clinical importance planning therapy patient . To prevent progressive joint damage , miss factor need replace . Much evolve practice last 50 year . From administration whole blood beginning , plasma cryoprecipitate , purify plasma-derived concentrate finally recombinant factor concentrate . The standard therapy replace factor frequently enough maintain &gt; 1 % factor level time ( “ prophylaxis ” ) administer immediately premonition early sign bleed ( “ demand ” therapy ) . This greatly enhance quality life people hemophilia . However , optimal regimen factor replacement remain define . The definition optimal management chronic condition , currently incurable vast majority patient , varies significantly different part world , depend practicality social expectation . Models care develop Western country base careful documentation outcome many year . Such data lack develop country . This multi-center study aim systematically record outcome musculoskeletal function people hemophilia develop country first time provide information help plan care 80 % hemophiliacs world live country . Currently well document model care range factor replacement practice country significant information long-term outcome musculo-skeletal function among patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3.1 Musculoskeletal function hemophilia - natural history Severe hemophilia characterize recurrent bleed large joint muscle result progressive damage deformity time patient reach end second decade ultimately lead severe functional disability many affected people . This fact well know long . The orthopedic outcome person severe hemophilia perhaps different different part world till 1960s . However , last three decade , ability factor replacement therapy completely modify clinical outcome severe hemophilia recognize . Factor replacement therapy evolve much period infusion large quantity factor concentrate transform outlook condition . A person hemophilia lead nearly normal life without fear frequent bleeding joint . 3.2 Factor replacement preserve musculoskeletal function - current model As late early 1960s , factor replacement large quantity difficult fresh plasma could use . With discovery cryoprecipitate 1964 , ( 1 ) large quantity could infuse . Further purification lyophilization make home-therapy possible . ( 2 ) It soon obvious early factor replacement could reduce joint damage significantly . Two school practice evolve : on-demand therapy factor concentrate infuse early evidence bleed prophylactic therapy aim maintain factor level 1 % time . Both approach require large quantity factor concentrate could completely alter expression disease prevent recurrent bleeding joint . ( 3,4 ) What facilitate approach enhance safety plasma derive recombinant factor concentrate . ( 5,6 ) Improved method donor selection introduction viral inactivation step manufacture process make concentrate safer ever . ( 7 ) The convincing data effectiveness prophylactic factor replacement hemophilia Sweden . As show carefully document long-term data , perfect joint architecture preserve large quantity factor concentrate range dos 4,000-9,000 IU/kg annually . ( 3 ) More recently , similar data Netherlands show much low dos range 1,400-2,500 IU/kg annually , joint damage significantly reduce . ( 13 ) Unfortunately , study report disability status patient relationship extent joint damage . In word , clear data whether person joint score show mild damage necessarily worse functionally someone joint core show moderate damage . However , often large difference among term total quantity factor replacement therapy . In fact , clinical experience suggest often poor correlation joint score functional disability joint . Optimal regimen factor replacement therefore still remain defined . Two large multi-center study evaluate regimen prophylactic therapy underway Italy Canada . 3.3 Models factor replacement develop country While model replacement therapy effective preventing arthropathy , also make hemophilia one expensive diseases treat . ( 8 ) Therefore benefit approach limit people hemophilia live developed country . ( 9 ) For three quarter people hemophilia world live develop country , treatment nature remain distant dream . Most receive little factor concentrate . Blood bank product continue use factor replacement therapy . ( 10 ) As effort make improve care , necessary develop practical model management hemophilia country . 3.4 Aim factor replacement therapy The predominant cause morbidity hemophilia damage result repeat bleeding joint . It therefore aim therapy establish standard evidence damage joint , clinically radiologically . ( 11 ) The effectiveness approach preserve joint integrity good become standard therapy economically developed country . Unfortunately , annual cost therapy $ 50-100,000/person high difficult even country develop economy adopt universally . It certainly desirable people hemophilia world level care . However , reality simply economically feasible . While per caput GDP develop economy $ 20,000 , develop economy range $ 500-3,000 . ( 12 ) Apart , attitude towards health care vary considerably many country spend less $ 10 per person annually . In situation , necessary establish different philosophy factor replacement . The aim shift maintain perfect joint integrity reasonable joint function allow person remain functionally independent . Out necessity choice , people hemophilia develop country physicians accept fact . The situation factor replacement joint bleed develop country variable . The limited data available suggest total quantity factor concentrate use varies 2-30,000 IU/person annually correspond 25-500 iu/kg/year . ( 14,15 ) Some center use factor concentrate intermediate range report preservation reasonable joint function functional independence . However , back carefully document data orthopedic outcome . A systematic evaluation orthopedic outcome different replacement protocol help develop suitable model treatment hemophilia country also assist health care planner determine cost care . In recent year , considerable effort make many develop country get support government insurance agency hemophilia care absence adequate data outcome protocol practical situation make difficult convince authority even low dos preserve long-term functional independence . A unique aspect study assessment functional independence people hemophilia correlation joint score . Unfortunately assessment functional independence measure hemophilia standardize . After much discussion WFH Congress Seville subsequent meeting SSC ISTH prospective co-investigators advisor , include Drs.Donna DiMichele , H. Marijke van den Berg , Bruce Evatt Carol Kasper , decide apply generic instrument WeeFIM® till hemophilia specific instrument become available . This instrument easy administer show excellent consistency . ( 16 ) Baseline factor level quantum factor replacement may determinants musculo-skeletal outcome hemophilia . Levels coagulation protein , include presence prothrombotic marker , also alter clinical outcome . Polymorphisms various modulators inflammatory response may play role . Though envisaged study parameter study , plan collect blood sample inform consent evaluate parameter future , possible . Hypothesis While likely good correlation joint score functional independence low joint score , correlation unlikely linear even significant , increase joint score . This study aim document outcome musculo-skeletal function large number child severe hemophilia receive varying level factor replacement therapy long period time particular emphasis joint score functional independence status patient .</detailed_description>
