	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass whether patient likely fail R-CHOP , predict mid-treatment PET scan , improve outcome switch standard salvage regimen R-ICE ( rituximab , ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ) . Patients negative PET scan 4 cycle R-CHOP excellent prognosis ( &gt; 85 % chance cure ) complete treatment 6 cycle standard R-CHOP . Patients positive PET scan 4 cycle R-CHOP poor prognosis ( ~10 % chance cure ) may improve outcome switched non-cross resistant chemotherapy combination R-ICE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tailoring Treatment B Cell Non-hodgkin 's Lymphoma Based PET Scan Results Mid Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II trial investigate tailor first-line therapy advance stage diffuse large B-cell NHL ( DLBCL ) base mid-treatment 18F-FDG- positron-emission tomography ( PET ) scan result . More half patient DLBCL cure 6-8 cycle standard R-CHOP ( rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone ) . Patients cure R-CHOP poor prognosis . This study ass whether patient likely fail R-CHOP , predict mid-treatment PET scan , improve outcome switch standard salvage regimen R-ICE ( rituximab , ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ) . Objectives : - To assess efficacy tailor first-line therapy base mid- treatment PET scan result patient advance stage DLBCL . - To assess progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient advanced stage DLBCL negative mid-treatment PET scan receive standard therapy six cycle CHOP-R patient positive mid-treatment PET scan receive four cycle CHOP-R follow four cycle R-ICE chemotherapy . - To assess overall survival ( OS ) patient advanced stage DLBCL negative mid-treatment PET scan receive standard therapy six cycle CHOP-R patient positive mid-treatment PET scan receive four cycle CHOP-R follow four cycle R-ICE chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
