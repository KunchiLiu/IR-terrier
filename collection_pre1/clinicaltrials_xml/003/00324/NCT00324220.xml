	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study MGCD0103 With Azacitidine Patients With High-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) Acute Myelogenous Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I : The purpose first part ( Phase 1 ) study find side effect experimental drug MG-0103 combination azacitidine body . The first part , Phase , study find much MG-0103 give safely along azacitidine people cancer without cause side effect severe . Patients give MG-0103 azacitidine watch closely see side effect may develop make sure side effect see , take care rapidly . If side effect severe , patient ask join study give slightly high dose MG-0103 . If severe side effect , patient join study later get high dos MG-0103 patient join earlier . All patient get dose azacitidine . This continue dose MG-0103 found cause severe side effect high enough portion patient . This maximum dose MG-0103 give patient study . Doses high give . Additional patient may ask join study receive MG-0103 possibly azacitidine low dos cause severe side effect . Phase II : MG-0103 combination azacitidine may also effect disease . The purpose second part ( Phase 2 ) study find , , effect . This Phase study also find information side effect combination drug . In Phase , patient receive slightly low dose maximum dose find first part study ( cause tolerable side effect ) . If certain effect disease patient see , patient ask join study . Additional patient may also ask join study receive low dose information collect study suggest do .</detailed_description>
