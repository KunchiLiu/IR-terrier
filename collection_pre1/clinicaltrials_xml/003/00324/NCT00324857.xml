	<detailed_description>The propose project represent next phase trajectory VA research design eliminate racial disparity utilization knee joint replacement - effective treatment option end-stage knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Numerous study document existence mark racial disparity utilization knee joint replacement OA . African-Americans ( AA ) two five time less likely white patient receive knee joint replacement low extremity OA . Our prior work show compare white patient , AA patient expect bad outcomes treatment , consequently , less willing consider joint replacement even clinically indicate recommended physician . Patient willingness , attitudinal disposition modifiable education counseling , emerge key patient-level mediator utilization elective medical procedure , knee joint replacement . The short-term goal randomize , control trial demonstrate efficacy intervention improve understand knee joint replacement risk , benefit , expect outcome among AA primary care patient , increase willingness consider knee joint replacement among AA primary care patient , increase primary care referral rate surgical consideration AA patient meet indication knee joint replacement . We test multi-faceted intervention consist knee OA decision aid video develop Foundation Informed Medical Decision Making alone combination individually tailor patient counseling use Motivational Interviewing versus attention control . The long-term objective reduce eliminate racial gap utilization knee joint replacement . The central hypothesis proposal scientifically accurate , high quality patient-centered information knee arthritis joint replacement provide knee OA decision aid , alone combination motivational interviewing , improve patient understand knee joint replacement outcome , increase patient willingness consider knee joint replacement , consequently lead high rate referral surgical consideration clinically indicate . With increased referral rate , currently major bottleneck path joint replacement , AA patient receive recommendation surgery , thus potentially reduce racial difference utilization procedure . This proposal innovative first patient-centered evidence-based VA intervention trial use decision aid alone combination motivational interview intervene well-documented mark racial disparity joint replacement exists within outside VA health care system . Primary Specific Aims : 1 . To examine effectiveness propose intervention strategy ( DA alone , MI alone combine DA+MI ) ) improve willingness consider knee joint replacement clinically indicate among AA primary care patient . 2 . To examine effectiveness propose intervention strategy patient expectation knee joint replacement risks/benefits among AA primary care patient . 3 . To examine effectiveness propose intervention strategy increase primary care referral surgical evaluation AA patient knee OA . Secondary Specific Aim : To examine effectiveness propose intervention strategy increase AA patient likelihood receive knee joint replacement within 12 month intervention . A randomized , control factorial design utilized examine effectiveness knee OA decision aid and/or MI compare attention control select key patient-centered process care outcomes . We recruit approximately 600 AA primary care patient ( 150 VAPHS , 150 LSCDVAMC , 300 PVAMC ) meet American College Rheumatology clinical indication knee joint replacement randomize either intervention arm attention control . We assess patient expectation , willingness referral joint replacement . We also collect qualitative data doctor-patient communication follow intervention control ass ( future ) whether intervention impact study outcome improve quality communication . This study provide hard evidence need improve quality care African-American VA patient end-stage knee OA , major cause disability functional decline VA elderly patient .</detailed_description>
