	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study chemotherapy bevacizumab see well work compare chemotherapy alone treat patient stage IB , stage II , stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab also may stop growth non-small cell lung cancer block growth new blood vessel necessary tumor growth . It yet know whether chemotherapy effective without bevacizumab treat non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Without Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage IB , Stage II , Stage IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Was Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall survival chemotherapy without bevacizumab use adjuvant set patient resect stage IB ( &gt; = 4 cm ) - IIIA non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate disease-free survival toxicity chemotherapy without bevacizumab use adjuvant set patient resect stage IB ( &gt; = 4 cm ) - IIIA NSCLC . II . To perform analysis tissue blood establish factor predict clinical outcome patient receive chemotherapy , without bevacizumab , resect early stage NSCLC . III . To determine whether smoke status link outcome patient resect stage IB ( &gt; = 4 cm ) - IIIA NSCLC treat chemotherapy without bevacizumab adjuvant set . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I ( adjuvant chemotherapy without bevacizumab ) : Patients receive 1 4 chemotherapy regimen . REGIMEN 1 : Patients receive vinorelbine ditartrate intravenously ( IV ) 10 minute day 1 8 cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 immediately follow vinorelbine ditartrate administration . REGIMEN 2 : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 cisplatin 1 hour day 1 immediately follow docetaxel administration . REGIMEN 3 : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 immediately follow gemcitabine administration . REGIMEN 4 ( non-squamous histology ) : Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV 10 minute cisplatin IV 1 hour day 1 immediately follow pemetrexed disodium administration . In regimen , treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II ( adjuvant chemotherapy bevacizumab ) : Patients receive chemotherapy Arm I . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment bevacizumab repeat every 21 day 1 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
