	<brief_title>Mild Water-Filtered Near Infrared Whole-Body-Hyperthermia Adjunct Treatment Fibromyalgia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mild systemic heat agent , include infrared whole-body hyperthermia , use treatment option multimodal rehabilitation program fibromyalgia Germany . However , randomize control clinical trial exist effectiveness condition . This study design add-on study evaluate additional benefit mild walter-filtered near infrared hyperthermia standard multimodal rehabilitation program compare standard multimodal rehabilitation program . Standard multimodal rehabilitation configure usually apply clinical trial exercise , cognitive behavioral therapy , health education main treatment component . Mild walter-filtered near infrared hyperthermia ( heating-up 38.1 degree C body core temperature follow 15-min heat retention period ) administer twice week 3 week rehabilitation hospital stay . Primary outcome measure measure baseline , postintervention , 3 6 month postintervention . Analysis do intention treat , significance test Repeated Measures ANCOVA use .</detailed_description>
