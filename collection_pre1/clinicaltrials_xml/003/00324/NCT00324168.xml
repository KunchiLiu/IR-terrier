	<detailed_description>Antimicrobial treatment bacterial corneal ulcer generally effective eradicate infection . However , `` successful '' treatment always associate good visual outcome . The scar accompanies resolution infection leave many eye blind . Some corneal specialist advocate use topical corticosteroid along antibiotic effort reduce immune-mediated tissue damage scar . Others fear use steroid reduce cornea 's immune response prolong even exacerbate infection . Ophthalmologists divide issue 30 year , approach acceptable accord American Academy Ophthalmology 's Preferred Practice Patterns . Evidence animal human report mix . A single randomize trial saw non-significant benefit steroid drastically underpowered ( 20 patient per study arm ) . The study randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled trial determine whether add topical steroid improve outcomes bacterial corneal ulcer . Five hundred bacterial corneal ulcer present Aravind Eye Hospitals , University California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) Proctor Foundation , Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center randomize receive antibiotic plus steroid antibiotic plus placebo . They follow closely re-epithelialization rechecked three week , three month 12 month post enrollment . A subset patient contact follow-up visit four year post enrollment . The primary outcome best spectacle-corrected visual acuity three month enrollment , use best spectacle-corrected enrollment visual acuity co-variate . The pilot study conduct January 2005 August 2005 Aravind Eye Hospital assess feasibility safety estimate sample size large main trial . Forty-two patient culture-proven bacterial keratitis enrol . They treat follow main trial , three month enrollment .</detailed_description>
