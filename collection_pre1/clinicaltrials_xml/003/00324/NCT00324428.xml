	<brief_summary>This phase II study aim investigate prospectively new therapy cohort patient chronic pain attribute pancreatic cancer . The justification study pain important factor quality life patient rTMS show significantly associate pain improvement patient abdominal pain due chronic pancreatitis . This therapeutic trial 10-day , randomize , parallel-group design , double-blind , incomplete cross-over , placebo control clinical trial conduct Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center . The principal aim investigation study pain therapeutic intervention . The primary outcome pain reduction index pain reduction analgesic intake reduction . The second aim study assess safety new treatment patient pancreatic cancer . The third aim study investigate whether rTMS treatment associate change activity right secondary somatosensory cortex use magnetic resonance spectroscopy . Because patient locally advance advanced pancreatic cancer often require increase dos narcotic pain medication , morphine , oxycodone fentanyl , order control pain , adverse side effect frequent observed population patient . Therefore rTMS treatment might represent new therapeutic approach might useful pancreatic cancer also type cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim protocol investigate possible novel treatment visceral pain patient locally advance advanced pancreatic cancer . Pain major contributor poor quality life patient pancreatic cancer . Most patient locally advance advanced pancreatic cancer abdominal pain require treatment increase dos narcotic pain medication . The refractory nature pancreatic cancer pain pharmacologic therapy lead u hypothesize one mechanism lead pain patient dysfunction brain cortical regulation visceral sensation . This notion support find deep electrical stimulation brain produce pain relief patient intractable pain due progressive cancer various type . In addition , patient pancreatitis , non-malignant pancreatic condition cause chronic pain , continue experience disabling pain even total pancreatectomy . These find suggests pain symptom pancreatic cancer sustain pancreas-independent , neural-based mechanism brain . Visceral sensation process secondary somatosensory area ( SII ) . Therefore , pancreatic cancer pain may sustain dysfunction SII rather local effect cancer alone . We hypothesize , dysfunction SII one hyper-excitability . According hypothesis , suppression SII activity may help control pain patient pancreatic cancer may provide synergy pharmacologic treatment . Temporary inhibition SII activity obtain novel , non-invasive procedure call transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . TMS suppress brain excitability beyond duration direct application TMS appropriate stimulation parameter utilized . This hypothesis support sham control , double blind pilot trial 5 subject idiopathic chronic pancreatitis : active rTMS apply SII result significant pain improvement three subject sham provide benefit patient . Furthermore , recent evidence suggest stimulation brain area , dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex , modulate acute , experimentally invoke pain ( Graff-Guerrero et al 2005 ) . We rigorously test hypothesis pain due pancreatic cancer sustain dysfunction SII characterize hyperexcitability two specific aim : 1 . The first aim study examine whether 1Hz repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) apply SII ten day two consecutive week patient abdominal pain due pancreatic cancer analgesic effect . 1 . The primary outcome aim difference pain score level Visual Analogue Scale Day 11 Day 28 compare week rTMS . The null hypothesis difference pain score pre post-treatment . 2 . The secondary outcome aim ass difference use narcotic pain control Day 11 Day 28 compare Day 1 . The null hypothesis difference narcotic use ( IV morphine equivalency unit ) pre post-treatment . 2 . The second aim study assess safety rTMS patient pancreatic cancer . 3 . The third aim study investigate whether rTMS treatment associate change activity right SII use magnetic resonance spectroscopy . Therefore compare level substances two different time point ( baseline post-treatment ) leave right SII . We expect decrease excitatory neurotransmitter level ( Glutamine - Glx ) stimulate area result inhibitory rTMS . SAFETY In pilot study chronic pancreatitis patient , subject experience adverse effect single session rTMS . Subjects ongoing study 10-day course rTMS chronic pancreatitis patient also experience adverse event ( 10 patient thus far ) . Fifteen-day course rTMS use treatment various neuropsychiatric disease without complication safety guideline carefully follow . We adhere current safety recommendation rTMS endorsed International Society Transcranial Stimulation International Federation Clinical Neurophysiology . Therefore , hypothesize propose rTMS protocol safe patient population .</detailed_description>
