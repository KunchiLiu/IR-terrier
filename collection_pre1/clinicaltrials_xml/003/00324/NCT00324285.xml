	<brief_summary>Severe malnutrition associate high rate mortality , even use late WHO recommendation . Watery diarrhea observe cholera additional vital risk child . The fragility child together complexity pathophysiology simplicity medical environment treatment deliver serious constraint development new therapy . Dehydration special immediate risk child already display alter body distribution water potassium , magnesium , zinc nutrient deficiency . Dehydration also often associate decrease appetite . In addition , intestinal function alter infectious agent nutritional status child . Recommended therapy child comprise oral rehydration ReSoMaL ( modify ORS use severely malnourished child recommend WHO ) , relatively low rate , permanent monitoring ; addition , breastfeed interrupt feed F100 ( Milk base formula diet use severely malnourish child recommend WHO ) recommend . Recently , amylase-resistant starch add standard WHO-ORS show reduce duration severity adult cholera . The rationale use amylase-resistant starch starch enters colon metabolize bacteria . The short-chain fatty acid thus produce stimulate sodium absorption colon , like glucose stimulates water absorption small intestine . In addition , treatment would particular interest malnutrition short-chain fatty acid specific energetic substrate colon.In present project , propose test hypothesis addition amylase-resistant starch already recommend treatment severely malnourish child cholera reduce severity duration diarrhea ; could achieve effect short-chain fatty acid colonic sodium absorption . In addition , good recovery malnutrition could achieve energy provide short-chain fatty acid colon improve appetite improve rehydration . Thus , aim study measure effect amylase-resistant starch add already accept treatment ( minimal change ) rehydration rehabilitation phase treatment . A total 210 child age 6 mo 60 mo study three group : ) glucose base ORS amylase-resistant starch ; b ) glucose base ORS without amylase resistant starch ; c ) rice base ORS . The major outcome variable first phase ( diarrhoeal duration stool output ) , second phase ( food intake , weight gain ) compare two treatment group . The result study find effective reduce duration diarrhoea , enhance recovery diarrhoea malnutrition severely malnourish child , contribute good case management child .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN This randomize control clinical trial . Subjects Inclusion criterion : 1 . History acute watery diarrhoea &lt; 72 hr . 2 . Either sex . 3 . Age - 6m 60 month 4 . Some severe dehydration . 5 . Wt Ht &lt; 70 % NCHS median : without edema . 6 . Dark field examination positive Vibrio cholerae . 7 . Consent give patient legal guardian . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Bloody diarrhoea . 2 . Severe infection ( e.g . severe pneumonia , clinical sepsis , meningitis ) . 3 . Those received antibiotics/antimicrobial current illness Sample Size Sample size calculate basis duration diarrhoea recently complete study WHO-ORS vs. ReSoMaL severely malnourish child diarrhoea ( 65±46 vs. 61±45 ) . Expecting 35 % reduction duration diarrhoea propose new treatment consider 5 % level significance 80 % power , sample size group 70 . Considering stool weight , reference ( stool wt . 158±95 treat WHO ORS ) severely malnourished child cholera , sample size estimate 65 group , expect 30 % reduction stool weight first 24 hour new treatment consider 5 % level significance 80 % power . Finally consider study 70 patient treatment group . Randomization After enrollment study patient randomize receive one follow three solution : 1 . Modified glucose base WHO ORS 2 . Modified glucose WHO ORS plus 50 g/L amylase resistant starch . 3 . Modified rice base ORS Since significant proportion child might present ALRI , randomization stratify two stratum : 1 . Children ALRI 2 . Children without ALRI Accordingly , two randomization list prepare . The randomization list prepare use random table permute block variable length . Baseline information A baseline history examination obtain order : 4determine subject 's eligibility inclusion study ; 4collect relevant data prior begin study . The baseline history examination include : 4identification patient ; 4a description symptom prior admission duration ; 4detail treatment give illness admission ; 4results physical examination include state hydration . Assessment dehydration This do accord modify WHO guideline use ICDDR , B . ( Appendix-III ) . Laboratory test After admission blood Hct , total protein , glucose , serum electrolyte send initiation assign ORS . Serum electrolytes repeat 24 48 hour initiation ORS therapy . Stool sample send microscopy ( include cryptosporidium giardia ) culture shigella , salmonella , Vibrio cholerae ELISA rotavirus do . Other relevant investigation like Total WBC count , Differential count urine microscopy do routinely . Chest X-ray and/or Blood culture do , necessary . For blood test 3 ml blood drawn suitable vein hand . Estimation fecal Starch SCFAs Feces 50 patient collect bucket . The first 24 h collect feces weigh aliquot take stored -20o C analysis SCFAs HPLC . The second third stool sample collect 24-48 h 48-72 h respectively . The feces weigh aliquot store -20oC determination SCFAs . Fecal starch measure enzymatically starch-assay kit ( Total Starch Assay Procedure , Megazyme , Warriewood , Australia ) . Case Management ( Acute Phase ) After randomization child treat follow standardize protocol management severely malnourish child use ICDDR , B hospital ( 2,12 ) . Fluid Therapy ( oral ) Dehydration assessment do accord WHO guideline modify last multicentre clinical trial reduce osmolarity ORS adult cholera child watery diarrhoea ( 17 ) . In child dehydration , fluid deficit correct assigned ORS @ 10 ml/kg/hour first two hour , 5 ml/kg/hour deficit correct . In addition , go stool loss correct @ 5-10 ml/kg/ watery stool . For high purging patient , ORS intake adjust accord go stool loss . ORS therapy continue diarrhoea cease . Randomization patient , take consent darkfield report collection take 20 minute . If delayed 20 minute child offer glucose base ORS subsequently switch assigned ORS . Children severe dehydration , initial rehydration do IV fluid ( cholera saline ; Na 133 mmol/L , Cl 98 mmol/L , K 13 mmol/L Acetate equivalent HCO3 48 mmol/ L ) patient shock disappearance sign severe dehydration rest rehydration do rehydration patient dehydration describe . Infection Control As routine practice ICDDR , B hospital antibiotic treatment study child follow : Children without apparent extraintestinal infection receive Inj ampicillin @ 100 mg/kg/24 h 4 divided dos Inj . gentamicin @ 5mg/kg/24h 2 divide dos 5 day . Patients low respiratory tract infection receive Inj : ceftriaxone 75 mg/kg/24 h I/M I.V one daily dose Inj . gentamicin 5 mg/kg/24 h 2 divide dos 5 day . All patient receive erythromycin 50 mg/kg/24 h 4 divide dos 3 day . Patients oral thrush treat oral nystacin suspension 100,000 unit ( 1ml ) 6 hourly cure . Diet Mother 's advised continue breast feeding . Supplementary feeding F100 diet give @ 10 ml/Kg/ Feed two hourly day 1 increase slowly 150 Kcal/ Kg/Day 7 day accord patient 's demand . If child poor appetite , weak , painful stomatitis/glossitis , food introduce nasogastric tube patient take normal oral feeding . In addition F100 , semisolid food ( Rice , lentil , vegetable etc . ) give old child convalescent rehabilitation phase . Vitamin Mineral Supplements ( As routine hospital practice ICDDRB ) Children without xeropthalmia 1yr age , give vit A 200,000 unit 6-12 month age child give 100,000unit admission . Children xeropthalmia dose give admission , 2nd day discharge . Folic acid 1.25 mg elemental zinc 2 mg/kg give 15 day . In addition child give multivitamin supplement ( 1 ml contain A palmitate 5000 IU , vitamin D 1000 IU , thiamine hydrochloride 1.6 mg , riboflavin 1 mg , pyridoxine hydrochloride 1 mg , nicotinamide 10 mg , calcium D-pantothenate 5 mg , ascorbic acid 50 mg ) . 1 ml twice daily 15 day 1 yr. half dose give infant less &lt; 1 yr. age . Hypoglycemia ( blood glucose &lt; 3 mmol/L ) manage 50 ml 10 % glucose orally nasogastric tube . Hyponatraemia ( serum sodium , &lt; 115mmol/L without symptom manage Inj . 3 % Nacl 12 ml/kg I/V slowly 4 hr . Children serum sodium 115 - 125 symptom treat 3 % NaCl addition adjunct therapy , need . Measurements All intake ( ORS , water , food ) output ( stool , urine vomit ) measure every 6 hour diarrhoea stop upto 7 day . Body weight vital sign also measure 6 hourly . Study withdrawal Reasons withdrawal 1 . Any patient develop severe complication severe pneumonia , clinical sepsis , meningitis require intensive care . 2 . Parents/legal guardian withdraws consent . 3 . Patients continue diarrhoea 7 day Management withdrawal case The withdrawal case transfer general ward ICU appropriate management provide accord routine hospital practice . Regular follow-up do final outcome child record . Data collect time withdrawal include analysis . Management cessation diarrhoea ( Convalescent / Rehabilitation Phase ) All patient cessation diarrhoea control associate infection transfer nutrition rehabilitation unit ( NRU ) They manage F100 diet accord requirement . Older child get semisolid food addition F100 . During stay NRU Vital sign body weight measured morning daily . Food intake measure every feed child stay NRU . After seven day patient discharged nutrition rehabilitation unit follow next fifteen day home . They supply standard diet accord protocol . The health worker visit every alternate day interview mother illness approximate amount diet child consume . The health worker carry portable electronic balance precision 1 g record body weight child . Definition End study ( acute phage ) - The study end point consider diarrhoea stop 7 day initiation ORS whichever come first . Cessation diarrhoea - Diarrhoea consider stop last watery stool pass follow soft form stool and/or stool 12 hour . Hypokalaemia- Hypokalaemia define serum potassium level &lt; 3.5 mmol/l . Persistence hypokalaemia - If serum potassium level &lt; 3.5 mmol/l admission remain level even 48 hour therapy ORS , consider persistence hypokalaemia . Over hydration - As standard criterion define hydration , develop work definition hydration protocol base previous study report clinical experience . Over hydration consider child 5 % weight gain expect correction dehydration / least one follow sign : Development periorbital oedema ; Increased heart rate ( &gt; 160/min ) ; Increased respiration rate ( &gt; 60/min ) ; { absence sign suggestive pneumonia ( fever , CXR abnormalities etc . ) } Hypoglycaemia - define blood glucose £ 3 mmol/l Hyponatraemia - define serum sodium &lt; 130 mmol/l Severe pneumonia : Patient age 6 - 12 - respiratory rate &gt; 50/minute chest draw Patient age 13 - 60 - respiratory rate &gt; 40/minute chest indrawing ( WHO guideline ) - 'ORS failure ' - If randomization patient need I/V rehydration therapy label ORS failure . Organization trial Study site - The study do study ward Clinical Service Centre ICDDR , B . Study schedule - The study period 2 year start . Recruiting training study personnel - First one month . Data collection - 23 month ( Estimated basis bed allotment per protocol patient availability ) Data analysis reporting - 3 month OUTCOME VARIABLES Primary Duration diarrhoeal course stool output . Secondary 1 . Calorie intake per day 2 . Daily weight gain 3 . Time attain 80 % weight height SIGNIFICANCE If ORS contain amylase resistant starch find reduce severity diarrhoea increase recovery patient acute diarrhoeal illness severely malnourish child , major public health significance regard well case management malnourish child diarrhoea .</detailed_description>
