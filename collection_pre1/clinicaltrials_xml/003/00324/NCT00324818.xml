	<detailed_description>Bacterial vaginosis ( BV ) prevalent cause symptomatic vaginal discharge U.S. associate complication include preterm delivery infant , pelvic inflammatory disease ( PID ) , urinary tract infection ( UTI ) acquisition/transmission sexually transmit disease ( STDs ) include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Control BV advocate decrease prevalence complication . The etiology BV remain unknown current treatment regimen inadequate term initial cure recurrence rate . Further , half woman meet clinical diagnostic criterion BV asymptomatic treatment woman remain controversial . More detailed characterization origin , natural history response therapy would supply data guide control effort . We approach problem multifaceted interdisciplinary evaluation woman without BV . The specific aim { hypothesis } project : 1 . To conduct study determine optimal agent duration therapy BV { Hypothesis : Longer duration therapy combination therapy result high cure rate low recurrence rate BV ; response therapy differs woman asymptomatic BV symptomatic BV } 2 . To examine role condom prevention BV { Hypothesis : BV sexually transmit infection , thus recurrence rate BV low among woman high condom usage rate } 3 . To explore role Mobiluncus spp. , organisms strongly associate syndrome , utilize specimen derive study . { Hypothesis : Mobiluncus involve pathogenesis BV least subset woman , persistence organism associate lack cure recurrence BV }</detailed_description>
