	<brief_title>Safety Study Once Day ART Opiate Substitute .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients history opiate abuse ( IVDU ) patient population frequently difficult reach healthcare system , also exhibit specific problem HIV-treatment ( ART ) . These patient frequently chaotic lifestyle , make difficult take medication regularly . Amongst reason housing difficulty , intoxication substance abuse . The introduction opiate substitution treatment help provide structure certainty patient . Even IVDU patient often start ART later others great tendency treatment interruption sub-optimal adherence ART . The end result treatment failure development drug resistance . There unmet medical need ART regimen make adherence easy may suitable co-administration once-daily opiate substitution . The availability tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( DF ) 300 mg offer new option creation once-daily regimen reduce potential drug-drug-interactions . It believe possible construct viable daily HIV treatment regimens patient either never receive prior therapy history drug resistance . Tenofovir DF administer single 300 mg tablet daily food treatment HIV infection . This daily dose schedule tenofovir DF make attractive option simplify dose regimen many subject , include methadone-maintained individual infect HIV . Because many opiate-maintained subject require methadone dose directly observe clinic , considerable interest use directly-observed therapy ( DOT ) subject . Given tenofovir eliminate renally methadone predominantly hepatically metabolize , potential pharmacokinetic interaction low . However , antiretroviral agent substantial renal elimination didanosine stavudine show interact pharmacokinetically methadone . Thus , important demonstrate tenofovir DF methadone administer together safely without concern pharmacokinetic interaction and/or alteration efficacy , safety , tolerability methadone maintenance dose modification would require . This also influenced product combination therapy . HIV/HBV coinfection frequent issue population ( &gt; 20 % ) . Treatment TDF , active HBV , could help stabilize chronic HBV infection , even case Lamivudine-resistance .</detailed_description>
