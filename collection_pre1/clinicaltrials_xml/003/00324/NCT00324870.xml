	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose vorinostat give together bevacizumab see well work treat patient unresectable metastatic kidney cancer . Vorinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth kidney cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving vorinostat together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability vorinostat ( SAHA ) combination bevacizumab patient unresectable metastatic renal cell carcinoma . ( Phase I ) II . Determine recommend dose patient treated regimen . ( Phase I ) III . Determine proportion patient progression-free 6 month receive regimen . ( Phase II ) IV . Determine clinical response rate patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity regimen patient . ( Phase II ) II . Determine time progression duration progression-free overall survival patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) III . Determine pharmacodynamic effect peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumor treatment regimen patient . ( Phase II ) IV . Determine antiproliferative apoptotic effect regimen patient . ( Phase II ) V. Determine antiangiogenic effect regimen patient . ( Phase II ) VI . Determine modulation tumor metabolism tumor blood flow patient treated regimen . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study vorinostat ( SAHA ) follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive oral SAHA twice daily day 1-14 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos SAHA maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . An additional 6 patient treated MTD . PHASE II : Patients receive SAHA MTD determine phase I bevacizumab phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
