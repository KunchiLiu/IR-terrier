	<detailed_description>Introduction Rationale Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) second common neurodegenerative disease US , affect nearly 1 million Americans . Up 82 % community dwell individual PD complain sleep disturbance , typically sleep fragmentation . This difficulty sleep maintenance accompany decrease total sleep time increase number awakening wakefulness sleep . The interaction PD sleep complicate many PD patient insomnia concomitant sleep disorder REM Sleep Behavior Disorder ( RBD ) , Periodic Limb Movements Sleep ( PLMS ) Sleep Disordered Breathing ( SDB ) . Nonetheless , majority patient appear insomnia integral symptom PD rather relate specific sleep disorder . Sleep difficulty patient PD independent important predictor poor quality life . In addition , sleep disturbance contribute excessive daytime sleepiness ( EDS ) poor daytime function well patient ' reduce enthusiasm daily event impairment quality life spousal caregivers7 . There , therefore , variety reason u address sleep problem patient PD . Despite high prevalence sleep problem impact life individual , , recently , little research focus problem . While researcher begin describe phenomenology epidemiology sleep PD , treatment study clinical community derive guidance . Despite lack evidenced-based clinical guidance , community survey indicate 40 % patient PD take sleep pills.3 Data publish 1999 indicate two commonly use hypnotic general practice trazodone zolpidem . More recent data continue show trazodone prescribe even frequently zolpidem . We recently complete survey 50 Parkinson 's disease expert find commonly use hypnotic zolpidem trazodone . Of note also expert estimate 40 % patient PD use sleep medication . We follow clinical problem treatment patient PD . Insomnia common strongly associate variety adverse outcome control data guide approach treatment individual . Nevertheless , clinicians appear use number hypnotic , principally zolpidem trazodone , neither evaluate PD long term use . Objectives To test safety efficacy eszopiclone treatment insomnia patient Parkinson 's disease Hypothesis Eszopiclone result significantly great improvement placebo patient report total sleep time ( diary ) patient PD six week trial . Study Design Duration This multi-site , double blind , placebo-controlled , two arm , parallel group , fixed-dose trial last 6 week . Seventy patient four site ( 30 PI 's site total 40 patient three external site ) equally randomize eszopiclone placebo . Preliminary screening conduct telephone . Inclusion exclusion criterion list . Those individual appear appropriate schedule in-person screen visit sign inform consent . At screen visit , detailed sleep , medical psychiatric history , variety background demographic form ( See Schedule Events - Appendix A ) complete . Subjects meet entrance criterion schedule polysomnogram end two-week baseline period keep sleep-wake diary . Those meet criterion insomnia receive overnight polysomnographic evaluation screen primary sleep disorder REM Sleep Behavior Disorder ( RBD ) , Periodic Limb Movements Sleep ( PLMS ) , Sleep Disordered Breathing ( SBD ) . To minimize cost , plan obtain one two night baseline PSG evaluation , depend amount total sleep time observe first night record . Patients show 4 hour total sleep , include least 30 min total REM sleep , receive one night PSG evaluation . These value select minimum necessary amount sleep evaluating concomitant sleep disorder . Patients meet criterion first night , whose result equivocal , receive second night baseline evaluation . The exclusion criterion apply either night . If sufficient sleep either night patient exclude . Polysomnographic evaluation conduct use standard nocturnal polysomnographic procedure . This consist 2 monopolar electroencephalographic ( EEG ) lead ( C3-A2 O1-A2 ) , 2 monopolar electro-oculograms ( EOG ) , bipolar submental ( chin ) right leave tibialis ( leg ) electromyogram ( EMG ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Respiratory airflow monitor use thermocouple ( Pro-Tech Services , Inc. ) , place nose mouth . Respiratory effort measure plethysmography use piezoelectric sensor ( Pro-Tech Services , Inc. ) Snoring record use snore sensor ( Pro-Tech Services , Inc. ) . Arterial oxygen saturation measure finger probe pulse oximeter ( Nonin ) . All subject videotape PSG evaluation provide positional behavioral information regard sleep episode . All sleep parameter collect simultaneously computerize acquisition system ( REMbrandt , Medcare Diagnostics ) . Sleep score 30-second epoch accord standard criterion Rechtschaffen Kales . Those meeting entrance criterion equally randomly assign receive eszopiclone placebo treatment 6 week . Both group receive equal-appearing pill take night . The dose trial fix stratified age : 65 receive 3 mg eszopiclone match placebo night ; 65 old receive 2 mg eszopiclone placebo night . Patients visit screen , interim phone contact review sleep diary , PSG , baseline week 2 , 4 , 6 , medication monitor pill intake , therapeutic response adverse event review . The procedure do visit list Appendix A . All group record sleep-wake diary 2 week screen phase first six week study . Patients ask require provide care giver complete questionnaire screen visit week 6 visit . Patients terminate prematurely continue trial till end stop medication continue record diaries one week time return final visit .</detailed_description>
