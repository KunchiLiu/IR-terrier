	<criteria>Postmenopausal woman advance hormone receptor positive ( ER PgR ) breast cancer , receive prior treatment aromatase inhibitor advance disease setting , experience least 24 week progression free survival . As long patient experience aromatase inhibitor response define way , still eligible even receive line endocrine therapy , may include aromatase inhibitor tamoxifen , even subsequent line treatment unsuccessful ( see permit chemotherapy trastuzumab therapy ) . OR Postmenopausal woman systemic unresectable local relapse take least two year adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy . Clinical diagnosis postmenopausal status define either : 1 . Age great 50 year amenorrhea 1 year 2 . Bilateral Surgical ovariectomy 3 . Serum FSH estradiol level postmenopausal range initiation AI therapy . 4 . If patient receive LHRH agonist maintain postmenopausal state AI therapy continue since recovery menses would lead uncontrolled estrogen exposure pregnancy estrogen therapy contraindicate . Tumor cell expression ER and/or PgR ascertain either primary metastatic site . However types tissue available , metastatic site use determine eligibility . ER and/or PgR positive define least 10 % malignant cell positive nuclear staining . The patient may receive adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy . Prior radiotherapy permit long plan start study medication complete within 3 week trial medication start . Prior tamoxifen therapy also permit adjuvant advanced disease therapy . Patients ER+ HER2+ disease eligible even receive trastuzumab past ( even administer combination endocrine treatment ) long meet eligibility criterion . Trastuzumab therapy must hold estradiol treatment . Use prior experimental agent alone combination endocrine therapy also permissible , wash one month require immediate prior therapy involve study medication subject regulatory approval . Prior adjuvant chemotherapy permit well one line chemotherapy advance disease . Patient must least one measurable lesion define RECIST criterion . To consider measurable , baseline lesion must minimum diameter compensate measurement error : 1 cm soft tissue lesion , 1 cm lung lesion include pleural lesion measure CT scan , 1 cm liver lesion measure CT scan . Patients bone disease also enrol meet follow criterion : 1 . Four lesion one cm , measurable CT scan bone window . 2 . At least one tumor marker elevate least two time upper limit normal . 3 . All patient baseline bone scan Xray evaluation hot spot , CT chest abdomen pelvis ( bone window ) , tumor marker assessment . Also CT scan extremity do suspicious area see Xray evaluation hot spot extremity lesion follow response . The patient must ECOG performance status 02 The patient life expectancy &gt; 6 month . The patient must adequate hematologic function , define ANC &gt; 1000/mm3 platelet &gt; 75,000/mm3 . The patient must adequate renal function , define serum creatinine less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal . The patient must adequate liver function define serum bilirubin less equal 1.5 time upper limit normal ( three time upper limit normal patient hereditary benign hyperbilirubinaemia ) , transaminase ( ALT , AST ) less equal 2.5 time upper limit normal patient without liver metastasis less equal 5 time upper limit normal patient liver metastasis . For patient bone metastasis , treatment i.v . bisphosphonates trial mandatory risk hypercalcemia . Bisphosphonate therapy must start patient begin protocol therapy . Preexisting hypercalcemia treat calcium normalize prior study entry . The patient must give write informed consent prior initiation invasive studyrelated procedure would otherwise perform , must able comply schedule visit evaluation . Inclusion Women Minorities : Entry study open woman racial ethnic subgroup . Patients fast blood glucose level â‰¤ 200 mg/dL . If great , hyperglycemia must treat initiation study investigation . Patients CNS involvement metastatic breast cancer life threaten lymphangitic large volume lung liver disease threaten organ function . Patients history deep venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , stroke , acute myocardial infarction , congestive cardiac failure , untreated hypertension . Ischemic change baseline EKG evidence ischemic heart disease . Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding Untreated cholelithiasis Fasting serum triglyceride great 400 . Patients treat triglyceride control prior study entry . Treatment fulvestrant within 12 month study initiation ( fulvestrant show antagonize estradiol induce apoptosis preclinical model ( 5 ) . The patient 's qualify lesion ( ) previously irradiate schedule irradiation follow study entry . Severe uncontrolled concomitant disease cause . EGOG Performance status 3 4 . The patient previous malignancy breast cancer except ) adequately treat situ carcinoma cervix , b ) localize basal squamous cell carcinoma skin c ) previous malignancy treat curative intent recurrence risk le 30 % . The patient unable understand inform consent unlikely compliant protocol . More one line palliative chemotherapy advance disease .</criteria>
