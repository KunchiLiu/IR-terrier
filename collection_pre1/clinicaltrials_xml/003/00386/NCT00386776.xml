	<detailed_description>We develop computer-based medical history patient take home via Internet . The history divide 24 modules— family history , social history , cardiac history , pulmonary history , like . So far possible , design model comprehensive , inclusive , general medical history traditionally take , time permit , primary care doctor see patient first time . It contain 232 primary question ask patient presence absence medical problem . Of , 215 preformatted mutually exclusive response `` Yes , '' `` No , '' `` Uncertain ( Do n't Know , Maybe ) , '' `` Do n't understand , '' `` I 'd rather answer ; '' 10 set multiple choice , one response permit ; five multiple choice one response permit , two numerical response . In addition , 6000 question , explanation , suggestion , recommendation available presentation , determine patient 's response branch logic program . These question available explore detail medical problem elicit one primary question . If example , patient respond `` Yes '' question chest pain , program branch multiple qualify question characteristic pain , onset , location , quality , severity , relationship exertion , course . Once complete interview preliminary form , make available member medical advisory board criticisms suggestion . We conduct formal read-aloud assessment 10 volunteer patient read primary question aloud investigator attendance offer understanding general assessment question . We revise program base comment advisory board patient We conduct test/retest reliability study 215 232 primary question preformatted , allowable response set `` Yes , '' `` No , '' `` Uncertain ( Do n't know , Maybe ) , '' `` Do n't understand , '' `` I 'd rather answer , 10 question response set one answer permit , 5 question one response permit . Email message send via PatientSite ( patient ' portal electronic medical record ) inform patient study sign inform consent form , consent study remind take interview first second time . ) From randomly select patient doctor affiliate Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston , 48 patient take history twice interval session range one 35 day ( mean seven day ; median five day ) . When analyzed inconsistency first second interview 48 patient respond primary question . We find 215 question response option `` Yes , '' `` No , '' `` Uncertain , '' `` Do n't understand , '' `` I 'd rather answer '' low incidence ( 6 percent ) ; 10 multiple choice question one response permit 13 percent incidence , five multiple choice question one response permit 14 percent incidence . Whenever inconsistency detect repeat interview , patient ask choose appropriate four possible reason . Reasons choose : `` click wrong choice '' ( 23 percent ) , `` sure answer '' ( 23 percent ) , `` medical situation change '' ( 6 percent ) , `` n't understand question ( le 1 percent ) . With remain 47 percent inconsistency , reason give . We compute percentage agreement primary question together Cohen 's Kappa Index Reliability . Of 215 `` Yes , '' `` No , '' `` Uncertain ( Do n't know , Maybe ) , '' `` Do n't understand , '' `` I 'd rather answer '' question , 96 ( 45 percent ) kappa value great .75 ( excellent agreement criterion Landis Koch , , 38 kappa value one ( perfect agreement ) ; additional 24 primary question ( 12 percent ) , patient make identical response time ( perfect consistency ) , Kappa value . Sixty-eight question ( 32 percent ) kappa value .40 .75 ( fair good agreement ) ; 26 ( 13 percent ) kappa value less .40 ( poor agreement ) . Of 27 question poor kappa value , 15 percentage agreement great 90 percent , deem sufficiently reliable within clinical context remain unrevised . We select 12 question poor kappa value percentage agreement le 90 percent reword . Of 15 primary question vary set response , half kappa value excellent range half kappa value fair good range , keep place unrevised . Fifteen primary question ( 7 percent ) receive `` n't understand '' response . Although single `` n't understand '' response question , able isolate seven possibility confusion seem evident , revise accordingly . With first two interviews—with mean 545 frame present completion time 45 90 minute ( base estimate 7 second per frame —the volunteer part favorable assessment interview ask set 10 , 10-point Likert-scale question . These result publish November 2010 issue Journal American Informatics Association . We also develop , edit , revise program provide concisely write , summary patient 's response question interview . This formidable project take considerably longer anticipated . The `` phrase '' basic unit summary . Identified unique reference number , phrase contains word generate , condition write , branch logic determines course program progress phrase phrase . The summary program General Medical Interview , contain 5,000 phrase , organize section relate name content correspond interview section . Designed use doctor patient available electronic print form , summary present legible otherwise traditional format . We able complete randomize control study time due couple factor . First , take substantially longer anticipated develop evaluate program effort comprehensive , detailed computer-based medical interview would compare favorably thoughtful physician . It take u two year develop , test , revise General Medical Interview far longer anticipated complete test-retest reliability study develop , test , revise summary program . In addition , medical center 's current policy obtain patient 's e-mail address patient first visit center patient register PatientSite first visit . Therefore , although could readily recruit e-mail participant test-retest study , limit far labor-intensive process telephone recruitment randomize , control study . We later obtain grant Rx Foundation u conduct clinical trial newly revise medical history . After complete medical history patient ask complete online 10 item 10-point Likert-scale post-history assessment questionnaire . At time office visit , summary computer-based history patient complete interview available doctor 's computer screen doctor patient use together voluntary basis . At option doctor , summary could edit incorporated patient 's online medical record . The day visit patient doctor ask complete 10-point Likert-scale questionnaire consist six question ask effect medical history summary quality visit patient 's doctor 's perspective , provision record comment suggestion improvement . The result publish January 2012 issue Journal American Informatics Association .</detailed_description>
