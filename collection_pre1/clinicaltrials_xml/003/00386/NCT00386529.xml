	<brief_title>Administration Time-dependent Antihypertensive Effects Low Dose Aspirin Well-controlled Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study show low dose aspirin exerts significant administration time-dependent effect blood pressure previously untreated hypertensive patient . However , effect confirm patient take low-dose aspirin combination antihypertensive medication . A multi-center , double-blind randomize , cross-over , active-control , comparative clinical study conduct evaluate influence aspirin blood pressure well-controlled hypertensive patient receive low dose aspirin different time day . Approximately 192 patient enrol 4 month 8 center nationwide . After placebo run-in period , subject randomize one follow 3 group . Group I &amp; II take low dose aspirin treatment period ( first second 12 week ) awaken bed time . Group III take placebo treatment period . After first 12 week ' treatment period , subject inform whether she/he belongs Group III . This do without break double blind 2 group . The primary objective evaluation influence aspirin blood pressure well-controlled hypertensive patient receive low dose aspirin different time day . The secondary objective 1 ) comparison administration time-dependent effect low dose aspirin blood pressure dipper non-dipper patient 2 ) evaluation effect low dose aspirin Korean hypertensive patient . A sub-study conducted 3 center evaluate effect aspirin endothelial function patient well-controlled hypertension .</detailed_description>
