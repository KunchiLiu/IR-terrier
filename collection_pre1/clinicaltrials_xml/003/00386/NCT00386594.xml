	<brief_summary>Barrett 's esophagus high-grade dysplasia premalignant condition cause chronic reflux gastric content esophagus . High-grade dysplasia carcinoma-in-situ . If untreated , patient condition high risk develop cancer esophagus . Cancer esophagus miserable disease difficult treat 95 % fatal 5 year . To prevent progession cancer esophagus several intervention available include surgery , Photofrin photodynamic therapy , endoscopic mucosal resection endoscopic thermal therapy . All modality uncomfortable , expensive associate risk . The oral agent , 852A stimulates innate immune system way eliminate early cancer . A similar dermatologic drug ( imiquimod ) approve treat premalignant condition , actinic keratosis . If local therapy imiquimod eliminate premalignant lesion skin , similar act drug able premalignant lesion line esophagus . This study design test hypothesis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Oral 852A Elimination High-Grade Dysplasia Barrett 's Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study determine locally apply immune response modifier eliminate high grade dysplasia Barrett 's esophagus . Barrett 's esophagus premalignant condition cause chronic reflux gastric content low esophagus . Present practice periodic esophagoscopy patient Barrett 's esophagus take biopsy search dysplasia . If pathologist report low grade dysplasia , patient usually receive intensive surveillance . If pathologist report high grade dysplasia , patient physician face dilema . High grade dysplasia carcinoma situ strong propensity patient progess frank carcinoma esophagus . Carcinoma esophagus miserable disease difficult treat lead death 95 % case 5 year . The present standard patient high grade dysplasia recommend esophagectomy . Esophagectomy major surgical procedure significant associate morbidity mortality . Porfimer sodium ( Photofrin ) photodynamic therapy effective eliminate high grade dysplasia Barrett 's esophagus . It approve FDA widely utilized complexity expense . Other modality endoscopic mucosal resection endoscopic thermal ablation techiques study . Although endoscopic technique much safe surgery , uncomfortable carry risk . Many patient Barrett 's esophagus elderly high grade dysplasia live long enough develop cancer . This fact make gastroenterolgists recommend intensive surveillance alternative mention therapeutic modality . Intensive surveillance setting mean endoscopy biopsy every 3 month specific therapy recommend frank cancer find . This study base upon fact intensive surveillance acceptable way follow patient . The difference oral agent add hope get rid high grade dysplasia . If high grade dysplasia could eliminate oral medication would quantum improvement . The present belief high grade dysplasia eliminate would progression cancer . 852A immune response modifier develop 3M Pharmaceuticals . It think exert therapeutic effect simulate alpha interferon . 852A similar immune response modifier imiquimod ( Aldara ) . Imiquimod presently approve precancerous dermatological condition , actinic keratosis . It effective . Treatment simply apply 5 % imiquimod cream twice weekly skin lesion 16 week . It seem reasonable immune response modifier eliminate precancerous lesion skin local application , true precancerous lesion esophagus . In study 852A swallow see whether eliminate high grade dysplasia esophagus . Entrance present study would predicate confirmation high grade dysplasia Barrett 's esophagus . If prospective subject meet inclusion exclusion criterion set protocol , endoscopic ultrasound esophagus would do . If endoscopic ultrasound show invasion submucosa patient would ask sign inform consent . Once enter sudy subject would give study drug twice weekly , 3-4 day apart , 8 week . 852A supply sterile vial 3M Pharmaceuticals . Five mg 852A mixed sterile 5 % dextrose water give final volume 30 ml . The patient promply swallow study drug mixed . The subject assume recumbent position 30 minute hop medication stay contact mucosa esophagus long enough get effect . All dos study medication give principal investigator 's clinic . After first dose give patient stay clinic observation 4 hour . Observation include take temperature , pulse , blood pressure every hour . If adverse effect first dose , observation period subsequent dos reduce one hour . Laboratory test repeat 1,2,4 8 week first dose give . As set study protocol , patient significant adverse event laboratory deviation , subject would drop study . Throughout study subject treat double dose proton pump inhibitor control gastric acid reflux . After 8 week therapy study medication stop . Four week thereafter 12 week begin , repeat endosocpy biopsy do . If biopsy show residual high grade dysplasia , patient continue intensive surveillance program . Intensive surveillance mean endoscopy biopsy every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year yearly 3 year . If high grade dysplsia persist 8 week treatment cancer find , patient would refer conventional therapy . Likewise , high grade dysplsia recurs cancer find intensive surveillance program , subject refer conventional therapy .</detailed_description>
