	<brief_summary>Annually , asthma responsible 1 million emergency room visit , 400,000 hospitalization , 5000 death accord NHLBI . In addition , 10 million miss school-days per year 100 million day restrict activity attribute disease . While know cause cure asthma , recent study show hospitalization emergency room visit reduce much 78 % 73 % , respectively , disease properly manage . According EPA , occurance child asthma double rate two decade ago ; 2001 percentage asthmatic child 8.7 % ( 6.3 million child ) . Properly manage asthma nontrivial often require asthma specialist . The difficulty diagnose manage asthma lie primarily lack available clinical technology capable assess airway inflammation , early persistent component asthma . Accordingly , National Institutes Health ( NIH ) guideline diagnosis management asthma strongly recommend long term anti-inflammatory therapy , oral inhaled corticosteroid , reverse airway inflammation effort prevent irreversible airway damage , term “ airway remodel ” . The medical community express need objective noninvasive measure airway inflammation diagnose asthma monitoring effectiveness compliance anti-inflammatory therapy . The clinical research plan design evaluate airway inflammation associate asthma . In human subject study , non-invasive exhale breath analysis sensor , call Breathmeter , use measure eNO concentration child adult ( age 4-65 ) broad range respiratory disorder well know respiratory disorder . Breath donation simple straightforward present little discomfort volunteer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study plan divide two section : in-clinic study large-scale outreach screening . ( A ) . Clinical Studies The clinical study intend obtain data characterize eNO concentration within individual group subject list inclusion criterion . The type study “ non-invasive ” , study design “ diagnosis/ treatment monitoring , efficacy ” . The study seek recruit subject fall one category list inclusion criterion . The number subject ( n ) recruit category give estimate base past number subject mainly Ekips Technologies , The Oklahoma Allergy &amp; Asthma Clinic , Norman Lung Center sit . Inclusion Criteria ( Total Number Subjects , n = 700 ) Both gender eligible study : 1 . Healthy subject ( n=120 ) 2 . Asthma ( Total n=450 ) [ diagnose accord NHLBI/ NAEPP Guidelines ( 1998 ) ] 1 . Non-treated B2-agonist treat asthmatic ( n=150 ) , 2 . Glucocorticoid treat asthmatic , ( n=150 ) , 3 . Leukotriene Antagonist treat asthmatic , ( n=75 ) , 4 . Glucocorticoid Leukotriene Antagonists treat asthmatic , ( n= 75 ) . 3 .

Allergies ( n=65 ) ) Atopic dermatitis , b ) Allergic rhinitis , c ) Seasonal allergy . Healthy Subjects Recruiting Healthy subject recruit visitor patient study site . Visitors may include relative friend accompany patient . Healthy employee study site may ask participate study . Patients , visitor , employee tell participate want . Exclusion Criteria Subjects young 4 old 65 exclude study . Pregnant woman also exclude study . Duration Participation For visit , participant study ask donate 3 breath sample first visit . The total time require breath donation measurement 5 minute . An additional five minute subject ’ time need complete short interview information need already available . Asthmatic suspect asthmatic patient , treat non-treated asked donate breath additional visit convenient . Follow-up measurement may perform regularly schedule office visit .</detailed_description>
