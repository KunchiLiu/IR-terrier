	<detailed_description>It important consider role HIV infect individual play ongoing HIV transmission . Different anti-HIV treatment regimen may lead variation HIV transmission risk behavior among HIV infect individual . HIV infected people viral load le 1,000 copies/ml less likely transmit HIV heterosexual sex .

The purpose study compare DC VS regimens affect HIV transmission risk behavior among SMART study participant . At baseline , participant complete questionnaire sexual behavior previous 2 month . They also undergo urine blood collection STI testing . These procedure occur Months 4 12 , every year thereafter first 4 year participant parent study .
