	<detailed_description>This multi-center , pilot , prospective , open label study . Approximately 20 patient recruit 10 15 center . The patient group follow : Elderly patient ( ≥ 55 year ) acute lymphoblastic leukemia undergo chemotherapy GMALL-Elderly 1/2003 protocol . They treat LAMB four week induction phase I . Patients attend full assessment trial completion withdrawal : 3 assessment visit first week , 2 assessment visit second week , 1 weekly assessment visit third fourth week prophylaxis treatment ( first visit week infusion visit well ) .
