	<detailed_description>Although clear loss ovarian function play major role menopause woman , evidence animal study primary age-related hypothalamic pituitary change may also contribute reproductive age . In woman , transition menopause characterized dynamic period markedly change hypothalamic-pituitary feedback age ovary . Complete cessation ovarian function result loss negative feedback ovarian steroid inhibin hypothalamic pituitary component reproductive axis . An increase serum level LH , FSH FAS occur postmenopausal woman removal negative ovarian feedback . However , level LH , FSH FAS menopause decline steadily function age though study . A series study laboratory conduct past several year specifically address effect age neuroendocrine component reproductive system . In study young old postmenopausal woman , confirm marked decrease serum level three secretory product gonadotrope age . This age-related decline gonadotrope secretion appear result decrease overall amount GnRH secrete amount GnRH secrete per bolus although GnRH pulse frequency slow age . Using high dos GnRH antagonist achieve complete blockade GnRH receptor examine degree GnRH contribute secretion LH FSH ( vi vi potential control factor , activin/follistatin system putative FSHRH ) . The degree GnRH contribute secretion LH FSH change follow menopause , contribution secretion FAS relatively increase . Preliminary data would suggest follow menopause independent age-related change degree GnRH contribute secretion gonadotropin . An increase gonadotropin clearance may theoretically contribute decline serum gonadotropin level follow menopause , unlikely case . It known isoforms LH FSH , differ carbohydrate structure , change carbohydrate composition alter plasma clearance . Heterogeneous population FSH LH separate 20 30 isoforms basis charge difference molecular structure . A shift acidic isoforms FSH document postmenopausal compare normally cycle woman previous study . More acidic form human FSH clear slowly injected mouse . While impact hormone clearance , find change vitro bioactivity alter isoforms FSH . In study GnRH receptor block use high dose GnRH antagonist , show serum half-life LH markedly prolong postmenopausal woman . We also show , FSH , shift acidic form follow menopause . Gonadal steroid administration associate shift less acidic form LH FSH make likely change isoform composition hormone menopause relate change gonadal steroid milieu . To date evidence age additional influence clearance LH menopause . As opposed effect intact gonadotropin , menopause alter plasma disappearance FAS . Taken together , study suggest loss gonadal feedback follow menopause alters form LH FSH secrete may contribute overall increase LH FSH postmenopausal woman . However , evidence increase gonadotropin clearance contributes decline serum gonadotropin level age menopause . In woman , transition menopause characterized dynamic period markedly change hypothalamic-pituitary feedback age ovary . In rodent , age associate decreased vitro secretion LH reduce LHb mRNA pituitary cell old compare mature castrate male female . The decrease baseline GnRH-stimulated LH , FSH FAS secretion disperse pituitary cell old compare mature castrate male rat suggest decrease functional capacity gonadotrope contribute decrease , systematic examination potential change gonadotrope number age animal specie . In woman , potential change ability pituitary respond GnRH function age examine use either amplitude endogenous LH pulse response exogenous GnRH , variable result . Rossmanith find absolute relative decrease response exogenous GnRH one study absolute , relative decrease age second study . Lambalk et al . find decreased response year post menopause , paradoxically , increase response GnRH chronological age postmenopausal woman . Although universally find , decrease absolute pulse amplitude function age observe study although generally change age amplitude express relation mean level . Unfortunately , significant disadvantage method use assess functional capacity pituitary . LH pulse amplitude response endogenous GnRH secretion integrate hypothalamic pituitary effect age response exogenous GnRH dependent precede interpulse interval variable influenced age . Thus , although bulk evidence point age-related decrease ability pituitary secrete gonadotropin , improved methodology require fully address issue postmenopausal woman . While ample evidence negative feedback regulation gonadotropin secretion low dos estrogen , site action less clear . In rat model ovariectomy associate increase LH FSH secretion increase expression LH , FSH mRNA reverse addition estradiol . The post-castration increase gonadotropin subunit associate increase number cell express LH , increase cell size increase amount expression per cell . Similar effect ovariectomy estradiol replacement gonadotropin expression demonstrate sheep . In woman , study show less decline gonadotropin level estrogen replacement old woman suggestive decreased sensitivity estrogen negative feedback age . Evidence demonstrate effect estrogen negative feedback neuroendocrine system inconsistent study demonstrate either decrease lack change GnRH pulse amplitude and/or frequency . Our study young old postmenopausal woman show significant decrease GnRH pulse amplitude rather frequency estrogen replacement . These study , however , suggest pituitary contributes estrogen-induced decline gonadotropin secretion indirectly , secondary steroid-related change GnRH , directly , indicate several line evidence establish direct estrogen negative feedback effect pituitary level . Although previous study controversial , preliminary data suggest estrogen negative feedback increase age . A month physiologic estrogen administration postmenopausal woman associate significant inhibition pituitary responsiveness grade dos GnRH . These result stand contrast result FDG-PET study support hypothalamic , pituitary site estrogen negative feedback 24 hour onset low dose estrogen infusion , similar result previous study reveal hypothalamic site estrogen negative feedback alone administration tamoxifen normal GnRH deficient woman . One interpretation result inhibition LH associate short-term ( 24 hour ) exposure low-dose estrogen mediate hypothalamus alone , prolong ( 28 day ) exposure similar low level estrogen , hypothalamic direct pituitary effect contribute LH inhibition . The current protocol determine sensitivity pituitary secretory response gonadotrope control condition without estrogen feedback young old postmenopausal woman . Furthermore , estrogen feedback assess short-term versus prolong estrogen exposure .</detailed_description>
