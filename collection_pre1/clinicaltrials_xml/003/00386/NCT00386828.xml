	<brief_summary>This phase II study evaluate effect bevacizumab , capecitabine oxaliplatin radiation rectal cancer . Researchers also evaluate tolerability ( make patient feel ) safety combination watch harmful side-effects.It hop add bevacizumab capecitabine/oxaliplatin treatment combination radiation surgery improve response rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Improved pre-operative therapy require management high risk rectal cancer order decrease local recurrence increase rate sphincter spar surgery . Capecitabine , oxaliplatin bevacizumab represent new systemic agent give safely phase I II trial concurrently radiation promise improvement pCR rate 15 -24 % compare historic rate 8-14 % achieve 5-FU alone . Improvements pCR rate associated increase post-operative complication rate . A trial three agent justify due enhance efficacy give combination well non-overlapping treatment toxicity profile . This one-armed , multi-centred , Phase II study patient T3/4 locally advance T3/4 low lie rectal cancer , study efficacy safety addition bevacizumab regimen capecitabine oxaliplatin combination pre-operative radiation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma rectum , define either : Mid upper rectal tumour ( &gt; = 6 15 cm ) : T3 T4 adenocarcinoma fix partially fix tether potentially resectable ; Low rectal tumour ( &lt; 6cm ) : T3 T4 adenocarcinoma : Node positive rectal tumour ( &lt; = 15cm ) : T14N2 T14N+ pelvic node approach invade mesorectum . M0/X M1 permit long definitive resection primary tumour plan , opinion investigator , safe delay full dose systemic chemotherapy Appropriate staging investigation primary tumour , either endorectal ultrasound pelvic MRI . Male female age 18 old . Have performance status ECOG 0 1 . Have life expectancy great 6 month . Adequate organ function coagulation parameter measure : ANC &gt; =1.5 platelet &gt; =100 Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5X ULN AST , ALT &lt; = 2.5X ULN Bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 ULN PTT INR within normal limit Albumin &gt; = 30 Patient consent No neurological disease increase neurotoxicity oxaliplatin Be willing able comply protocol duration study . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior Day 14 , ( i.e . patient must recover major surgery ) , anticipation need major surgical procedure within 7 week chemoradiotherapy . Known clinical radiological evidence CNS metastasis . Patients past current history ( within last 2 year ) malignancy , except indication study curatively treat basal squamous skin cancer insitu cancer cervix . Women childbearing potential either positive pregnancy test baseline lactating . Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . Sexually active male female ( childbearing potential ) unwilling practice contraception study . Patients childbearing potential must willing use reliable method birth control . i.e . : doublebarrier method , oral contraceptive , implant , dermal contraception , longterm injectable contraceptive , intrauterine device tubal ligation study Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Uncontrolled hypertension , define SBP &gt; 150/100 one occasion respond therapy antihypertensive agent Clinically significant ( i.e . active ) cardiovascular disease example : cerebrovascular accident ( &lt; =6 month ) , myocardial infarction ( &lt; = 6 month ) , unstable angina , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) grade II great congestive heart failure , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication . Current recent ( within 10 day prior study treatment start ) ongoing treatment anticoagulant therapeutic purpose i.e . except anticoagulation maintenance patency permanent indwell IV catheter . Evidence disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug put patient high risk treatment complication . Ongoing treatment aspirin ( &gt; 325 mg/day ) medication know predispose gastrointestinal ulceration . Any serious uncontrolled illness . Current recent serious polyneuropathy . Known hypersensitivity bevacizumab . Known peripheral neuropathy &gt; = NCI CTCAE grade 1 . Absence deep tendon reflex ( DTRs ) sole neurologic abnormality render patient ineligible . Organ allograft require immunosuppressive therapy . Serious , nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture .</criteria>
