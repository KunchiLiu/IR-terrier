	<brief_title>Iron-fortified Whole Maize Flour Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fortification staple food iron may effective method address problem iron deficiency . Questions however remain type iron fortificants use , appropriate fortification level suitable food vehicle . Cereals form attractive vehicle widely consume part world bear large burden iron deficiency problem . They however high phytates would reduce bioavailability commonly use iron fortificants . Isotope study show even presence phytates , iron NaFeEDTA relatively bioavailable fortificant source . Its efficacy however assess human trial . Electrolytic iron , hand widely use legislate iron fortificant choice South Africa . Its efficacy high-phytate vehicle also assess . We therefore undertaken ass efficacy NaFeEDTA two dos , iron fortificant whole flour , efficacy electrolytic iron dose similar high-dose NaFeEDTA . The result contribute information suitability fortificants whole maize flour , food commonly consume sub-Saharan Africa .</detailed_description>
