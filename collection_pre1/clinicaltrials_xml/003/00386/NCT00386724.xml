	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate acute chronic efficacy spinal cord stimulation use Precision implantable neurostimulation device Artisan paddle electrode patient Failed Back Surgery Syndrome ( FBSS ) associate primary secondary back low extremity pain . There significant number patient FBSS moderate severe drug refractory pain . An optimal outcome demonstrate Precision SCS device significant effectiveness reduce pain result improve quality life functional capacity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Precision Spinal Cord Stimulation With Artisan Paddle Electrode</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The conventional implantation spinal cord stimulator call dual percutaneous lead place parallel T8-T9 vertebral level . A common problem surgery migration lead initial implanted site , consequence inadequate pain relief . Anecdotal report suggest paddle electrode eliminate problem associate lead migration provide constant distance parallel electrode . Furthermore , report provide superior pain relief paresthesia coverage . This study aim evaluate pain paresthesia coverage place paddle lead . Patients invited participate study eligible SCS therapy already select therapy Advanced Bionics Precision system , independent possible inclusion study .</detailed_description>
