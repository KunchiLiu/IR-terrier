	<detailed_description>`` Home-Based Pain Management Protocol Children Sickle Cell Disease '' BACKGROUND : Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) devastate chronic health condition primarily affect African-Americans . Painful episodes frequent form morbidity SCD frequent reason hospitalization . Cognitive-behavioral intervention pain management show efficacy improve cop ability , reduce amount medication need manage pain , improve daily function painful episode . However , difficulty disseminate implement cognitive-behavioral treatment result almost use technique pediatric setting . In South Carolina difficulty compound social geographical factor pose particular challenge . A major issue implement quality pain management protocol difficulty provide adequate practice monitoring use technique , particularly give rural population South Carolina transportation difficulty economically disadvantaged family . Due history under-treating pain SCD also critical psychological medical treatment present integrated manner approach view complimentary , mutually exclusive , approach pain management . Finally , believe implementation issue improve use behavioral coping skill also important improve adherence medication protocol appropriate home-based pain management . PURPOSE : The purpose research implement evaluate pain management protocol use portable electronic device ( PDA ) technologies increase practice psychosocial pain management technique , improve adherence overall biopsychosocial pain management protocol , improve clinician 's ability track progress few office visit . In addition address important dissemination issue , embed method assess adherence technology possible continuously evaluate modify protocol efficacy , result product effective , empirically sound , flexible . STUDY PROCEDURES : Recruitment Assignment Study Conditions . Families approach part routine psychosocial screening currently conduct Children 's Cancer Blood Disorder Center . Parental inform consent child assent obtain family meet inclusion criterion agree participate . Next , participant randomly assign waitlist control intervention group use random assignment procedure . The researcher explain detail participation incentive system family time , include number coupon assign phase study completion redeem coupon toy gift card . All participant ( waitlist control group intervention group ) complete initial measure : Background Information Questionnaire ; Structured Pain History Interview - Parent Child Forms ; Coping Strategies Questionnaire ( CSQ ) ; Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ( PEDS-QL ) ; Pediatric Pain Questionnaire ( PPQ ) ; Child Health Locus Control initial meeting second set measure ( CSQ , PEDS-QL PPQ ) 4 week initial meeting . Cognitive-Behavioral Training . Following completion intake measure , family intervention condition provide education pain medication use explanation active versus passive method cop pain cognitive-behavior technique introduce ( Progressive Muscle Relaxation , Deep Breathing , Guided imagery Distraction ) . These technique tailor child 's preference record onto PDA . Next , researcher review family pain flow chart , complete Daily Pain Activity Diary ( DPAD ) , use PDA Pain Management software . Participants parent provide detailed instruction regard care PDA , contact device broken lose , policy continue participation device lose , pad address stamped envelope return PDA require attention . Three day initial visit family contact answer question ensure implementation skill . Families also receive weekly telephone contact pre-arranged time address difficulty protocol implementation . Pain diary frequency skill practice electronically download approximately every three day use wireless synchronization build PDA device . One month follow initial session , participant ( waitlist intervention group ) complete PPQ , PEDS-QL CSQ outcome measure . Two month initial session , intervention participant complete outcome measure , include PPQ , PEDS-QL , CSQ Protocol Evaluation Form ( PEF ) . Six month initial session , intervention participant complete follow-up measure , include child report CSQ , parent child report PPQ PEDS-QL . At time participant 's school contact obtain school attendance record document absence due illness previous year participant medical record review examine patient 's disease severity course study participation time live ( Medical Record Review Form ) . Participants waitlist control group start participation intervention two month point , follow procedure outline intervention condition . Concurrent Validity Study Procedures . Assessment pain experience obtain study participant undergo routine venipuncture part clinic visit co-occurring study entry study completion . Observational , physiological response , parent-report , self-report pain experience obtain provide convergent validity measure pain report . A brief measure medical coping style , Child Approach-Avoidance Rating Scale ( CAARS ; Appendix J ) include assess shift cop strategy employ participant painful procedure . Participants parent report child pain experience , , routine venipuncture part clinic visit day initial contact . Participant response routine venipuncture also capture via video record allow in-depth analysis observable pain behavior . Pre-procedural heart rate take three interval : patient first see clinic visit , immediately prior venipuncture , immediately follow venipuncture . Additionally , small extra vial blood obtain ( 5mL ) measure participant 's level endothelin-1 , biological marker pain . This extra vial blood require additional needle stick . Finally , medical record participant review obtain information disease course . SUBJECT POPULATION : Participants include 50 child adolescent SCD range age 8 18 year age primary caregiver . Participants recruit Children 's Cancer Blood Disorder Center Palmetto Health four DHEC Children 's Rehabilitative Services sit ( Orangeburg , Columbia , Florence Sumter ) . Reviews behavioral intervention rheumatoid arthritis chronic low back pain indicated typical treatment effect size pain experience cop = 0.46 great ( Astin et al. , 2002 ; van Tulder et al. , 2001 ) . Using value basis compute study power ( alpha level .05 ) study expect power .80 sample size 50 participant . Inclusion/Exclusion criterion : Inclusion criterion mandate family select demonstrate adherence standard SCD treatment indicate reliable attendance clinic visit , chart note demonstrate adherence prescribe medical care ( e.g. , follow-through require specialist visit appointment diagnostic procedure ) . Participants must least 1 major pain episode 3 minor pain episode previous 6 month result functional impairment , reduced school attendance . Finally , individual developmental disability mental retardation , autism , Down syndrome , severe cognitive limitation follow stroke , diagnose severe psychopathology exclude participation disorder potential confound finding . CONFIDENTIALITY : To minimize threat confidentiality , investigator access participant data . For data management purpose confidentiality , subject give unique identifier use record data electronically transmission data . This arrangement minimize risk loss patient confidentiality . All study staff , include research assistant may enter data , require complete pas University South Carolina Human Subjects on-line tutorial prior commence work research project . All data store lock file cabinet investigator office Palmetto Health . EXPECTED RESULTS AND IMPLICATIONS : We anticipate intervention result well pain management le impairment participant . These data use seek funding larger-scale study development intervention decrease impact pain live individual SCD .</detailed_description>
