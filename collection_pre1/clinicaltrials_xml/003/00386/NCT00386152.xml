	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Two Different PROCRIT Doses Dose ARANESP Anemic Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( physician patient know treatment provide ) , multi-center study 16 week duration 450 patient randomly assign ( patient assign specific study group chance ) one three treatment group 1:1:1 ratio . Patients receive PROCRIT ( epoetin alfa ) 80,000 Units inject subcutaneously ( skin ) every three week 120,000 Units inject skin every three week ARANESP ( darbepoetin alfa ) 500 mcg inject skin every three week 13 week . PROCRIT ( epoetin alfa ) 80,000 Units 120,000 Units give every three week dose schedule approve use United States investigation , ARANESP dose schedule approve use United States . Adult patient specific type cancer ( confirm non-myeloid malignancy ) schedule receive cyclic chemotherapy minimum 12 week study meet eligibility criterion enrol . This study conduct approximately 80 study site locate United States . The study hypothesis dose regimen PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 80,000 Units 120,000 Units give every three week non-inferior ARANESP 500 mcg give every three week respect mean hemoglobin ( Hb ) change baseline Study Week 7 anemic cancer patient receive chemotherapy . Hemoglobin level monitor throughout study weekly basis drug dose administer . Drug dose adjust ( ie , hold , reduce , resume low dose ) need maintain hemoglobin value within desire range . The maximum dose PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) allow study 120,000 Units every three week ( Q3W ) maximum dose ARANESP ( darbepoetin ) 500 mcg Q3W . Safety evaluation conduct throughout study consist assessment laboratory test , vital sign , physical examination . The occurrence severity adverse event , include thrombovascular event evaluate throughout study.Periodic data monitoring study external Independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) perform . The main responsibility IDMC conduct ongoing monitoring safety report irregularity back Sponsor along recommendation regard continuation study . Each patient assign one three dose schedule . All schedule administer way subcutaneous ( skin ) injection every three week period 13 week . The three dose schedule follow : PROCRIT ( epoetin alfa ) 80,000 Units , PROCRIT ( epoetin alfa ) 120,000 Units ARANESP ( darbepoetin alfa ) 500 mcg</detailed_description>
