	<brief_title>Comparative Study 0.5 % Carboxymethylcellulose With 0.005 % Stabilized Oxychlorocomplex ( PURITE™ ) Versus 0.5 % Carboxymethylcellulose Treatment Dry Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry eye common disorder tear film . There million people dry eye around world . Dry eye patient may suffer redness , sandy sensation , itching , excessive watering , burn sensation , excessive mucous discharge , blur vision , contact lens intolerance , increase risk ocular surface damage ocular infection . Currently , curative treatment dry eye . The mainstay treatment still artificial tear supplement punctual occlusion . In moderate severe dry eye patient , standard replacement use non-preservative artificial tear 4 time day . However , non-preservative artificial tear limitation inconvenience carry , expensive , ocular surface trauma due sharp plastic tip . Recently , improvement use new disappear preservative artificial tear . One new preservative stabilize Oxychlorocomplex ( SOC , Purite™ ) dissipate water sodium chloride , component natural tear expose light . It also bactericidal viricidal activity . Scanning electron microscopy also reveal , carboxymethylcellulose ( CMC ) SOC low toxicity corneal epithelium preservative . The past study document 0.5 % CMC preserve SOC safe , comfortable well tolerate mild moderate dry eye patient apply 4-8 time daily . The objective study compare efficacy , tolerability , safety 0.5 % carboxymethylcellulose ( CMC ) Stabilized Oxychlorocomplex ( SOC ) 0.5 % carboxymethylcellulose alone patient moderate severe dry eye symptom and/or sign .</detailed_description>
