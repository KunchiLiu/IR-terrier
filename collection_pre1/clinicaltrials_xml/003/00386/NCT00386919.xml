	<detailed_description>Screening Procedures : Screening procedure test procedure do determine eligible take part research study . For research study , screen procedure include : Medical history , physical examination include neurological performance status , assessment preoperative postoperative scan , operative report pathology report . All already perform perform standard care condition even take part study . Research Procedures : If qualify take part research study , undergo research procedure : The pre- post operative MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) scan operation , operative procedure ( include sample know biopsy removal much tumor possible ) procedure facilitate radiation therapy planning ( make mask treatment position keep comfortably still CAT scan treatment position ) . These part standard procedures treatment tumor , whether study . One primary reason deliver radiation multiple small dos conventionally ( 30-33 treatment 6-61/2 week ) minimize damage surround normal brain . The Cyberknife technology allow precise delivery radiation tumor minimize radiation surround brain . This allow possibility deliver high dos radiation tumor thereby shorten overall treatment time ( 18 treatment 31/2 week ) . This studied study . The Cyberknife treatment long duration last 30-60 minute rather 5-10 minute conventional radiation treatment . During time ask lie comfortably still . The technology however permit radiation beam adjust precisely small movement may make maintain accuracy . Along radiation , get chemotherapy call Temozolomide , form pill . This also standard treatment whether study . You ask take pill every day course radiation 5 day month thereafter year . However radiation receive Temozolomide , use possibly make radiation effective , 4 week oppose 6 week conventional radiation . As part usual care chemotherapy may receive supportive medication prevent treat nausea , vomit , low blood count infection . Monitoring/Follow-Up Procedures . Procedures perform evaluate effectiveness safety experimental procedure call `` monitoring '' `` follow-up '' procedure . For research study , monitoring/follow-up procedure include : Clinical assessment include neurological performance status assessment blood test chemotherapy perform every month first year every three month thereafter . MRI scan one month completion radiation therapy every 2 month thereafter . All procedure perform routinely management tumor</detailed_description>
