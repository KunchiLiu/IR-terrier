	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Povidone-Iodine Treatment Bacterial Corneal Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis test : Infectious corneal ulceration cause corneal scarring , opacification , blindness hundred thousand child annually . In develop country , number one cause avoidable blindness child . While case , cornea healthy prior ulceration , others ; xerophthalmia , trachoma , rubeola , trauma , cause previously compromise cornea . Even ulceration associate one etiology , usually bacterial corneal ulcer directly lead blindness short-term . In many country , infection properly treat appropriate antimicrobial agent due number factor , include cost , availability , effectiveness . If topical antimicrobial agent readily available develop country also inexpensive effective , many ulcer could cure scar blindness result . The best candidate medication povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution . It already proven best agent sterilize ocular surface eye surgery prevent conjunctivitis newborn baby . It also show effective treatment bacterial conjunctivitis child . Povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution prepare local hospital clinic mix powder ophthalmic saline solution bring cost 10-ml bottle less US $ 0.10 . By contrast , Philippines , 10 ml . bottle Neosporin ophthalmic solution cost $ 4.00 may take bottle cure bacterial corneal ulcer . For far less U.S. dollar , corneal ulcer could fully cure . Povidone-iodine wide antimicrobial spectrum know topical medication . It show effective bacteria , fungi , virus . No true resistance povidone-iodine ever demonstrate . Allergic reaction rare . Thus , medication could serve purpose study , would povidone-iodine . The primary research question whether povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution effective heal bacterial corneal ulcer , , proven , would dramatic effect reduce pediatric blindness . The number subject determine primary outcome measure non-inferiority achieve minimum one-day difference control investigative group , povidone-iodine compare control medication study site . The control medication Neosporin ophthalmic solution Manila ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution two combined Indian site ( Hyderabad Tiruchirapalli ) total four study arm . The number recruit calculate achieve 90 % power detect non-inferiority use t-tests level significance 0.05 compare mean time cure . Cure define closure epithelial defect inflammatory sign minimal injection . Subjects provide write consent . As appropriate , child assent also obtain . At study site , subject allocate receive either povidone-iodine control medication . If corneal ulcer present bilaterally , one eye randomize receive povidone-iodine , receive control medication standard center . All subject hospitalize least 7 day careful monitoring appropriate treatment . To assure compliance , subject medication administer medical personnel . Treatment : The study medication 1.25 % povidone-iodine control medication Neosporin ophthalmic solution Manila , Philippines ciprofloxacin 0.3 % ophthalmic solution Hyderabad Tiruchirapalli , India . These medication standard care respective study site . The eye medication permit beside povidone-iodine 1.25 % ophthalmic solution control medication ( Neosporin ciprofloxacin ) atropine ophthalmic solution reduce intraocular inflammation prevent synechiae . The atropine solution administer affected eye ( ) twice day . Subjects less one year old receive 0.25 % solution , age one three year receive 0.5 % , old 3 year receive 1 % solution . The dose schedule povidone-iodine 1.25 % control ophthalmic solution follow : 1 . For first three day , one drop medication apply every hour . 2 . Day 4 thereafter : hourly awake . When asleep ( sleep exceed 9 hour ) , drop administer every three hour . All case treat intense drop therapy minimum 5 day unless criterion change therapy met ( see ) . 3 . At 5 day : If deterioration factor ( see ) improvement least one factor ( epithelial defect size ) 2 consecutive examination , dose frequency decrease every 2 hour awake ( 8 times/day ) 2 day , 4 times/day discharge . If status remain unchanged Day 5 , intense drop therapy continue 5 day . 4 . If 10 day status unchanged , subject exit study . All patient examine daily visual acuity ocular examination document . The daily eye examination finding score record follow six factor : 1 . Visual acuity 2 . Inflammatory sign 3 . Stromal infiltrate dimension 4 . Epithelial defect dimension 5 . MELT 6 . Tissue firmness , include keratic precipitate ( KP ) , anterior chamber ( AC ) cellular reaction , AC fibrin hypopyon status . The daily assessment ulcer status classify cure , improve , persistent , worsening failure . Criteria Change Therapy : Within first 48 hour , treatment change deterioration factor appearance descemetocele . After 48 hour treatment , treatment change deterioration one follow factor 2 consecutive examination : stromal infiltrate , melt , two sign symptoms inflammation . Epithelial defect size use assess status ; change medication . The new treatment leave discretion ophthalmologist . Culture Technique : All subject undergo microbiological analysis corneal ulcer upon intake study . A spatula apply cornea affect eye ( ) blood agar chocolate agar plat brain heart infusion broth ( BHI ) streak patient . Cultures repeat daily two negative culture obtain . If culture positive organism , organism consider infecting agent . Each culture plate incubate least seven day colony form unit differentiate enumerated standard bacteriological technique , include VPI technique anaerobic bacteria . No culture growth seven day constitute negative culture .</detailed_description>
