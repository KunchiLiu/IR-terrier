	<brief_summary>The study 's overarch aim determine whether Enzymatically Augmented Subcutaneous Infusion ( EASI ) assist out-of-hospital situation characterize mismatch need , ability achieve , access vascular compartment . One mechanism provide access vascular compartment , subcutaneous infusion , facilitate administration hyaluronidase ; hyaluronidase hydrolyze hyaluronan major subcutaneous diffusion barrier . Hyaluronidase thus increase local dispersion absorption subcutaneously administer drug fluid . The EASI Access study intend first out-of-hospital study assess FDA-approved Chinese hamster ovary-derived recombinant hyaluronidase ( recombinant product hereafter refer short brand name , Hylenex ) . The EASI Access test fundamental principle facilitate design implementation follow-up investigation ( e.g . extension access non-ALS provider ) . For example , attempt show EASI access simple , effective , downside compare IV access .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Recombinant Hyaluronidase Out-of-Hospital Setting : The EASI Access Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Challenges IV access outside hospital The out-of-hospital setting pose myriad challenge provider attempt gain access intravascular compartment . In individual patient encounter , placement intravenous ( IV ) catheter may hamper anatomy ( e.g . venous collapse hypotension ) , position ( e.g . entrapment ) , environmental condition light vehicular motion . These problem may compound situation multiple patient simultaneously require expedited IV access . Therefore , `` host '' ( i.e . patient ) `` environment '' ( i.e . physical setting ) parameter contribute mismatch desire , ability achieve , access intravascular compartment . The aforementioned issue IV line placement make assumption presence operator appropriate Advanced Life Support ( ALS ) -level train credential . Such may case mass casualty incident ( MCI ) situation , situation initial responder Basic Life Support ( BLS ) level . Thus , consideration potential barrier intravascular compartment access include `` personnel '' well `` host '' `` environment '' parameter . Case importance access intravascular compartment Is intravascular access really important ? Assuming EMS system could fiat easy widespread access intravascular compartment MCI routine ALS BLS response , impact outcome ? Unfortunately , often case EMS intervention , little randomize controlled evidence address issue - fact , related literature penetrate trauma suggests prehospital fluid resuscitation may deleterious . However , clinical practice well standard emergency medicine trauma resuscitation teaching ( Advanced Cardiac Life Support course Advanced Trauma Life Support text ) emphasize importance early fluid resuscitation variety injury illnesses.1 In addition , literature address MCI situation ( e.g . crush injury ) make strong case importance fluid replacement.2 Besides open avenue fluid replacement , catheter-based access intravascular compartment allow reliable delivery medication . For patient tolerate po intake , otherwise stand benefit parenteral drug delivery , catheter-based access intravascular compartment allow administration repeat dos variety drug avoid multiple ( often painful ) injection . Once catheter place ( currently , vein ) , access line available initial subsequent caregiver . It obvious out-of-hospital caregiver may use access line administration drug ( limit ) prehospital pharmacopoeia , equally true pre-establishment intravascular access save step arrival next level care . Practitioners today 's EDs currently benefit , saving nursing time , take time establish IV access patient transport hospital ALS unit . This help individual patient pre-established IV access , since ED staff immediately administer time-critical drug - include ALS armamentarium - also aid resource-taxed ED whose staff execute duty start IV line . Furthermore , though concrete support evidence , common wisdom hold placement ( small ) IV line fluid administration line , may facilitate subsequent placement large IV line due fluid vascular compartment . Thus , balance evidence variety standpoint ( outcome research , accept practice teaching , logistics ) support argument ability gain access intravascular compartment important priority out-of-hospital care . Importantly , note `` ED '' one could substitute `` triage tent '' MCI-related care site since intravascular compartment access obvious import MCI/disaster-type situation . Potential role EASI Mechanism subcutaneous infusion Subcutaneously administer drug infusates must traverse interstitial matrix enter vascular lymphatic system . The interstitium 's resistance drug permeation envision function like three-dimensional filter drugs/infusates must pass . There large molecule elastin collagen inhabit matrix hydrate gel-like glycosaminoglycans proteoglycans . Among glycosaminoglycans hyaluronan , contribute resistance fluid flow interstitium . Though hyaluronan find low concentration collagen skin , play disproportionately large role resist fluid movement.3 Hyaluronidase modify connective tissue permeability via hydrolyze hyaluronic acid , effect cleavage glucosaminidic bond N-acetylglucosamine glucuronic acid moiety . The cleavage result decrease viscosity cellular cement promote diffusion injected fluid , facilitate absorption . The decrease viscosity reverse within 24 hour , due rapid inactivation hyaluronidase enzyme also due rapid turnover rate skin hyaluronan.4 , 5 So-called `` spread agent , '' historically derive animal extract , use clinically facilitate dispersion absorption drug 50 years.4 The extensive history spread agent use relevant FDA review new recombinant enzyme . Based part upon longtime us ( nonrecombinant ) hyaluronidase , FDA approval Hylenex state drug : `` Indicated adjuvant increase absorption dispersion inject drug , hypodermoclysis , adjunct subcutaneous urography improve resorption radiopaque agent . '' Subcutaneous infusion instead , prior , IV infusion Out-of-hospital clinical scenario vary widely . It certainly true EMS patient , MCI patient , need IV line . However , easy think out-of-hospital situation rapidly easily place intravascular access could helpful , standard IV catheter may ( sole ) solution . To name example , could : - Single-patient encounter IV line difficult place - Multi-car motor vehicle crash ( MVC ) site attend many BLS , ALS , provider - Marathon medical support tent confront score volume-depleted individual - Building collapse ( e.g . earthquake ) numerous victim simultaneous timely fluid replacement stave crush-mediated renal failure Standard texts American College Surgeons ' Advanced Trauma Life Support note need IV access often present case ability place indwell vascular catheter . The ATLS text point fluid resuscitation clinically challenging environment ( e.g . austere condition , MCI situation ) often sufficient criticality , absence IV access , hydration attempt oral rectal route . As ACS Committee Trauma write , oral hydration obvious aspiration absorption risk , rectal clysis ( denote ATLS text ) present obvious logistic patient comfort issue field.1 It thus clear potential role EASI access access extend ability usefully reach intravascular compartment . In term potential mechanism out-of-hospital fluid replacement route drug administration , EASI warrant attention form trial . Compared current standard IV ( perhaps intraosseous ) line placement ALS-level provider , EASI access could enable out-of-hospital responder ( ALS well low echelon provider ) achieve intravascular access patient , quickly , reliably , less pain . We thus plan conduct EASI Access study out-of-hospital provider , mechanism investigate whether EASI access accrue hypothesize advantage . The study begin ALS-level provider . The ultimate plan , ALS provider EASI prove efficient , ass whether simple placement EASI access non-ALS provider extend reach advance care provider situation need IV access outstrips available resource . Not specifically goal EASI Access trial , potentially relevant future use Hylenex , ability avoid IV access may occasionally useful acute care set . In patient young , cachectic , simply need IV access fluid replacement , EASI may able obviate need ( possibly numerous ) IV `` stick '' attendant discomfort . The low , nonzero , rate IV access complication ( e.g . thrombosis , phlebitis ) general may also avoid use EASI access . The EASI Access investigation clearly offer potential advantage current trial 's study subject , hypothetical advantage avoid IV placement provide possible relevance positive finding EASI Access study .</detailed_description>
