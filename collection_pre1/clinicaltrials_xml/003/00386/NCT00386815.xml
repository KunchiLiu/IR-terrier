	<criteria>Histologic diagnosis malignant pleural mesothelioma Not candidate curative surgery . Patients clinically stag use IMIG TNM stag criterion Not receive prior systemic chemotherapy Patients must measurable lesion , diagnose CT , MRI scan within 28 day administration More 20 year less 75 year age ECOG Performance status score : 0 1 Prior radiation therapy allow &lt; 25 % bone marrow . Prior radiotherapy must complete least 21 day study enrollment , patient must recover toxic effect treatment prior study enrollment . Prior surgery must complete least 21 day study enrollment , patient must recover effect operation.However , regard examination thoracotomy celiotomy , etc . investigator subinvestigator judge influence surgery problem participation patient study , e.g . safety security , least 14 day surgery day patient registration date Patients adequate organ function Hemoglobin : less 9g/dl , Absolute neutrophil count : le 2,000/mm3 , Platelet count : le 100,000/mm3 , Serum albumin : le 2.5g/dL , AST ( GOT ) ALT ( GPT ) : 2.5 x upper limit reference value site ( 5 x upper limit reference value site acceptable liver tumor involvement ) , Total bilirubin : 1.5 x upper limit reference value site , Serum creatinine : upper limit reference value site , SpO2 : le 92 % , ECG : normal ( In case ECG mark abnormal waveshape , investigator subinvestigator judge safety issue patient , administration do ) , 24hrcreatinine clearance calculate creatinine clearance : le 45mL/min Estimated life expectancy least 90 day registration date Patients must hospitalize start first cycle start second cycle combination therapy , principle ( Only case investigator subinvestigator judge safety issue , patient receive therapy outpatient middle Cycle 1 ) Male female patient reproductive potential must use approved contraceptive method appropriate ( eg , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , birth control pill , barrier device ) 90 day study therapy . Females childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior study enrollment . Signed informed consent patient Serious uncontrolled concomitant systemic disorder Active systemic infection Active , double cancer ( patient synchronous double cancer asynchronous double cancer nondisease period 5 year ) ( except situ carcinoma cervix adequately treat basal cell carcinoma skin ) Patients symptomatic brain metastasis brain metastasis require treatment Presence clinically detectable thirdspace fluid collection , example , ascites pleural effusion control drainage . Have receive treatment within last 30 day drug receive regulatory approval indication time study entry . Having history sensitivity platinum agent , folic acid vitamin B12 Women pregnant , breastfeed could pregnant woman hope get pregnant within 90 day study . Man hop partner become pregnant within 90 day study . Patients neurotoxicity less CTC grade 2 study entry . Inability interrupt salicylate nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent 5day period ( 8day period longacting agent piroxicam ) . Inability unwillingness take folic acid vitamin B12 supplementation . Plane chest Xrays show widely diffuse image cause interstitial pneumonia . Patients judge inadequate study investigator subinvestigator</criteria>
