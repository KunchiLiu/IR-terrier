	<detailed_description>This design open label study effect 600 mg 1200mg gamma tocopherol ( gt ) , orally administer daily 8 day , serum antioxidant level asthmatic healthy volunteer . Each course gamma tocopherol follow 7-8 day wash period serum test ensure blood level back baseline prior start next course . The gamma tocopherol obtain Yasoo Health Inc contain 623mg gt per 830 mg gelatin capsule . Allergy skin test battery allergens common region perform determine state atopy prior drug administration 8 day course . Allergic volunteer ask abstain take antihistamine 3 day prior skin test . Repeat allergy test performed subject unable hold antihistamine health reason , non-allergic volunteer demonstrate response baseline test . Spirometry perform determine current level lung function .
