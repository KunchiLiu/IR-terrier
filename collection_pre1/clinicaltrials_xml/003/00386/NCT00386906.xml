	<brief_title>Sentinel Lymph Node ( SLN ) Biopsy Conjunctival/Eyelid Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>You conjunctival eyelid tumor surgically remove schedule remove . You lymphatic map tumor remove . Lymphatic map small volume Tc99m-Sulfur colloid inject ophthalmologist radiologic image take . If able become pregnant , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw pregnancy test , within 7 day biopsy . To take part study , must pregnant . You go operate room intraoperative SLN mapping biopsy . If SLN positive permanent section , go complete lymph node dissection , involve removal lymph node around positive SLN . Then disease restaged may require treatment consultation oncologist . Your medical record review , information medical record record review help researcher well identify patient microscopic lymph node disease . The information collect medical record include information sex , age , type cancer , well size cancer location . Researchers hope identify patient microscopic lymph node disease become clinically obvious . With technique , researcher could potentially identify occult metastatic disease would otherwise go unnoticed advanced . Patients study see ophthalmologist every three month usual metastatic workup , routine conjunctival/eyelid melanoma . Length Study : Your active participation study biopsy . You continue observe study 5 year biopsy . Long-Term Follow-Up : Every 3 month first year biopsy , every 6 month 5 year biopsy , eye exam check status disease . Every 6 month first year biopsy , blood ( le 1 teaspoon ) drawn liver function test . You also chest x-ray . You test 1 time year 5 year biopsy . You head neck CT MRI every 6 month first year biopsy make sure disease come back . The head neck CT MRI repeat 1 time year 5 year biopsy . This investigational study . A total 38 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>
