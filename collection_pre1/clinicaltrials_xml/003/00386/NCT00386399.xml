	<brief_title>Study Mitomycin-C Patients With Advanced Recurrent Pancreatic Cancer With Mutated BRCA2 Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients test mutation BRCA2 gene . If BRCA2 mutation , treat Mitomycin-C described . The patient identify gene mutation also provide genetic counseling . Patients BRCA2 gene treat Mitomycin-C ( MMC ) Day 1 dose 10mg/m2 intravenously . This repeat every 28 day , one cycle . Expected adverse event appropriate dose modification describe section . Treatment continue disease progression , serious toxicity , patient withdrawal maximum cumulative dose 60 mg/m2 . Primary Objectives : 1 . To determine 6-month survival patient previously untreated advanced recurrent adenocarcinoma pancreas BRCA2 mutation treat single agent Mitomycin-C ( MMC ) chemotherapy . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine response rate , six-month progression free survival rate , progression-free survival survival patient previously untreated advanced recurrent adenocarcinoma pancreas BRCA2 mutation treat single agent MMC chemotherapy . 2 . To describe toxicity MMC patient population . 3 . To explore pharmacogenetic factor may influence toxicity efficacy MMC patient population .</detailed_description>
