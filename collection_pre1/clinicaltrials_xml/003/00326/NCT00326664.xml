	<brief_title>AZD2171 Treating Young Patients With Recurrent , Progressive , Refractory Primary CNS Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose AZD2171 pediatric patient recurrent , progressive , refractory primary CNS tumor . II . Describe toxicity profile dose-limiting toxicity AZD2171 patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Characterize inter-patient variability pharmacokinetics AZD2171 patient . II . Describe change circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) circulate endothelial cell precursor ( CEPs ) patient treat AZD2171 different dose level . III . Correlate change CECs , CEPs , plasma , serum , urine level proteins angiogenesis , include vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGF receptor , patient treat AZD2171 different dose level . IV . Correlate change CECs , CEPs , angiogenic modulators change magnetic resonance ( MR ) perfusion . V. Obtain preliminary evidence biologic activity AZD2171 evaluate alteration tissue perfusion , tumor blood flow , metabolic activity use MR perfusion diffusion imaging , positron-emission tomography , correlate finding change tumor size standard MRI . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord concurrent enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant drug ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . For stratum , cohorts 2-6 patient receive escalate dos AZD2171 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose 25 % patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Once MTD determine , additional 6 patient per stratum enrol treat MTD . After completion study , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
