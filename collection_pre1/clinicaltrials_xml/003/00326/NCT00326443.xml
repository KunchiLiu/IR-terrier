	<brief_summary>The purpose research study see give typhoid vaccine mouth ( experimental vaccine , CVD 909 ) give vaccine shot ( Typhim Vi ) result good immune response give Typhim Vi vaccine . Another purpose see whether CVD 909 safe . Typhim Vi show safe effective prevent typhoid fever old child adult , work child age 2 . Scientists University Maryland think young child could respond Typhim Vi give dose typhoid vaccine mouth give Typhim Vi shot . Twenty-eight healthy adult volunteer , age 18-40 year , take part study . Study participation last 63 week , study visit first 6 week . Blood sample collect approximately 13 time . Four stool sample collect . Some volunteer may follow additional 4 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CVD 909 Vi Prime Boost Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I , randomize , double-blind , heterologous prime-boost study safety immunogenicity Vi polysaccharide typhoid vaccine prim live , attenuated oral Vi+ Salmonella Typhi strain CVD 909 . The primary study objective determine phase 1 safety prime-boost regimen prim CVD 909 , live attenuate Vi+ S. Typhi strain , follow boost licensed parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine healthy adult volunteer . The secondary objective compare immunogenicity license parenteral Vi polysaccharide vaccine volunteer prim single oral dose CVD 909 volunteer prim oral vaccine . The outcome measure interest seroconversion rate titer serum IgG anti-Vi antibody , time development longevity serum anti-Vi antibody , subclasses avidity antibody develop , memory B T cell response elicit . The following immunologic outcome measure seek : rate timing seroconversion study arm receiving Vi polysaccharide analysis immunoglobulin subclasses avidity . This assess presence prim rapidity anamnestic response . A successful priming would accelerate response boost ( Day 7 Vi vaccine ) , response expect balanced , induce Th1/Th2-type immunity evidence induction IgG1 IgG2 ; geometric mean titer ( GMT ) serum IgG anti-Vi antibody Days 7 , 14 , 21 , 35 post-Vi ( Days 28 , 35 , 42 , 84 study ) . This assess magnitude response ( another measure prim ) ; GMT serum IgG Vi antibody study arm multiple later time point 1 year receive parenteral Vi ( week 55 study ) . This assess quality duration antibody ; peripheral blood mononuclear cell collect measure cytokine production cytotoxic T lymphocyte ( CTL ) activity , well induction maintenance B T cell memory response home potential antibody secrete cell ( ASC ) T cell depend cell number . Twenty-eight healthy adult volunteer , 18-40 year age Baltimore community , recruit participate study , conduct Center Vaccine Development ( CVD ) , University Maryland School Medicine . The volunteer randomize receive either 5x10^9 colony form unit CVD 909 buffer buffer placebo alone . Three week later , volunteer receive 25 microgram ( 0.5 ml ) license purified Vi polysaccharide vaccine intramuscular route . Blood serum antibody secrete cell response Vi , S. Typhi LPS , O antigen drawn Vi boost . The patient participation duration 63 week , option prolong immunologic follow-up 4 additional year .</detailed_description>
