	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . AZD2171 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving gemcitabine carboplatin together AZD2171 may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study well give gemcitabine carboplatin together AZD2171 work compare give gemcitabine carboplatin without AZD2171 first-line therapy treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Carboplatin With Without AZD2171 First-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess objective tumor response rate patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer treat gemcitabine hydrochloride , carboplatin , AZD2171 first-line therapy . Secondary - Compare proportion patient progression-free 6 month treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride carboplatin v without AZD2171 . - Compare duration response respond patient treat regimen . - Compare time-to-progression time-to-treatment failure . - Compare 1-year overall survival . - Compare clinical toxicity . - Assess safety tolerability regimens patient . Tertiary - Collect blood tumor specimens future evaluation pharmacogenetic proteomic marker tumor response toxicity therapy agent . - Bank paraffin-embedded tissue blocks/slides blood sample future histochemistry evaluation DNA extraction . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior adjuvant therapy ( yes v ) ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 , carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , oral AZD2171 daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course . Patients achieve stable disease , partial response , complete response 6 course therapy receive AZD2171 alone . Treatment AZD2171 repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine carboplatin arm I . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection periodically study pharmacologic correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 102 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
