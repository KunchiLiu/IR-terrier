	<brief_summary>Nerve block arm hand surgery provide many advantage patient include excellent pain control reduction general anesthesia-related adverse effect . Infraclavicular block possibly best method perform regional anesthesia arm consistent anesthesia whole arm low incidence serious adverse effect . Normally anesthetist us nerve stimulation identify nerve supply forearm hand . Recent research indicate improve success 60 % 79 % two type muscle stimulation must seek injection local anesthetic . This time consuming , require significant learning process , increase complication leave 21 % patient inadequate anesthesia require supplementation general anesthesia . More recently practitioner use ultrasound image direct needle watch local anesthetic spread around nerve . Preliminary report document technique associate much great success nerve stimulation method . However good quality study compare dual-endpoint infraclavicular technique ultrasound-guided technique perform . This randomized study aim rectify deficiency determine ultrasound-guided infraclavicular block significantly great success current standard , dual end-endpoint nerve stimulation technique .</brief_summary>
