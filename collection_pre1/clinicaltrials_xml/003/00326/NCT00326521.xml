	<brief_summary>Briefly , investigator propose evaluate nulliparous ( first time mother ) patient beyond 36 0/7 week ' gestation active labor already receive epidural anesthesia intrauterine pressure catheter ( IUPC ) place . Any patient develops single temperature elevation &gt; 38 degree eligible inclusion consent study . Maternal blood drawn immediately , one hour later delivery . Amniotic fluid aspirate pressure catheter ; first 1-2 cc discard remainder evaluate gram stain , culture , glucose level , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , proteomics . All placentas send routine pathologic examination . Cord blood obtain birth routine study . Both maternal cord blood send proteomic evaluation ( define ) . The patient amniotic fluid positive gram stain culture define infected group , patient amniotic fluid negative gram stain culture define uninfected group . Differences clinical presentation laboratory assessment , include proteomics , compare two group determine marker might prove useful distinguish two entity ( epidural fever without actual infection ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Fever Occurring Labor Patients Receiving Epidural Anesthesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically diagnosis chorioamnionitis ( infection membrane surround fetus ) patient labor make basis multiple clinical variable maternal fever , fetal tachycardia , uterine tenderness , foul smell vaginal discharge . The diagnosis also take account clinical picture consistent risk factor prolong labor prolonged rupture membrane . Since finding specific , chorioamnionitis becomes diagnosis exclusion unless another explanation fever . Randomized study clearly show maternal antibiotic neonatal septic work-ups indicate diagnosis chorioamnionitis make . Neonatal sepsis severe infection blood stream . Such policy important implication health care provider , impact medical cost , duration hospital stay . This become especially true newborn transfer neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) sepsis evaluation . Often time , newborn prophylactically treat antibiotic base suspicion infection , wait finalize blood culture result . Since newborn sepsis difficult diagnosis make , many newborn treat actually disease length hospital stay may significantly increase . Over past 15 year , observational randomize trial observe increase maternal fever associate epidural anesthesia labor . These trial show increase range 10 - 15 % baseline rate increase relative risk 1.5 15 fold , even 70 fold one study , rate see woman receive epidural anesthesia . After correct duration labor confound variable , increase remain present . Since epidural fever virtually impossible distinguish chorioamnionitis-related fever , woman almost treat antibiotic give diagnosis infection . This approach also tremendous impact evaluation care newborn . Two specific study evaluate impact neonate . Lieberman find baby mother give epidural anesthesia likely evaluate sepsis ( 34 vs. 9 % ) treat antibiotic ( 15 vs. 4 % ) . Similarly , Philips find increase ( 25 vs. 16 % 19 vs. 11 % ) . Both study low rate confirm neonatal sepsis . On national basis , cost confusion nationally tremendous . There one know way distinguish true chorioamnionitis labor non-infectious fever due epidural anesthesia . Gibbs colleague find amniotic fluid aspirate intrauterine pressure catheter , device commonly utilized monitoring contraction labor , could use accurately make diagnosis infection use gram stain culture . More recently , many paper show low glucose level elevate IL-6 amniotic fluid also accurate test infection . While marker could theory use distinguish epidural fever true chorioamnionitis , patient require device approach would likely gain widespread favor . Alternatively , however , approach could use research tool woman already catheter place determine additional non-invasive clinical laboratory marker distinguish one . Recently proteomic assessment become extremely effective tool determine certain marker various disease . Proteomics determination structure , function , expression correspond protein encode within genome structure . It also define `` fingerprint '' disease process . It involve run tandem mass spectometry fluid interest . Such approach could extremely valuable determine whether mother actually chorioamnionitis , , whether good marker neonatal sepsis .</detailed_description>
