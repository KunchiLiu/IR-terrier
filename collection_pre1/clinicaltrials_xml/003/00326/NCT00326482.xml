	<brief_summary>This study provide basis research impact liver injury cause antiretroviral therapy HIV-infected patient . Elevated liver enzymes call AST ALT common HIV-infected patient take antiretroviral medication indicate liver damage . Although number possible cause elevation , infection hepatitis virus , antiretroviral medication alone lead elevation . The study focus particularly evidence liver fibrosis , sign progressive liver damage . HIV-infected patient 18 old 1 ) take combination antiretroviral therapy least 12 month stable regimen least 3 month , 2 ) elevate AST ALT level least 6 month may eligible study . Patients liver biopsy perform past may eligible participation . Participants undergo follow test procedure 12-month period : - Oral glucose tolerance test : The patient drink glucose ( sugar ) drink . Blood sample draw 2 hour intravenous ( IV ) line patient 's arm . This test measure high patient 's blood sugar insulin level rise drink standard glucose load . - Transient elastography : This ultrasound test use vibration ( sound wave ) measure liver stiffness ( fibrosis ) . Vibrations move faster fibrotic liver . - Triple-phase CT scan single slice CT scan L4-5 : Patients fast 4 hour CT scan . A contrast material inject catheter place arm vein improve visibility liver specialize X-ray image obtain CT scanner . - Liver biopsy : This test remove small sample liver tissue microscopic examination , particularly evidence fibrosis . The skin biopsy site numb needle pass skin rapidly liver . Patients may give sedative procedure . - Follow-up visit . Patients return follow-up visit 1 4 week liver biopsy three time course study medical history , physical examination blood test . Patients may participate additional 4-year follow-up , visit every 3-12 month offer opportunity repeat biopsy sooner 1 year first biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liver Fibrosis HIV-Infected Patients With Elevated Liver Enzymes Antiretroviral Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At present , clear guideline antiretroviral therapy human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection stop set elevate liver enzyme . In large part , due limit understanding natural history antiretroviral-related hepatotoxicity . Although several antiretrovirals report cause fatal acute hepatitis , often cause asymptomatic elevation transaminase level , optimal management uncertain . This pilot study seek create foundation research impact antiretroviral-induced liver injury provide estimate prevalence hepatic fibrosis cohort sixty HIV-infected patient chronically elevated transaminase antiretroviral therapy absence chronic hepatitis B ( HBV ) C ( HCV ) coinfection . Liver biopsy specimen evaluate fibrosis microscopic examination , current gold standard assess nature severity liver disease . [ 1 ] The presence fibrosis , well histopathology , describe use validate score system . Primarily , crosssectional study , subject offer opportunity participate extend follow-up period undergo another liver biopsy . Individuals exclude basis alcohol abuse , insulin resistance , lipodystrophy , data collect potentially confound variable . Noninvasive measure , transient elastography ( ultrasonic technique ) , assess ability predict fibrosis population . Correlations also seek laboratory marker fibrosis . The identification fibrosis ( precursor ) association antiretroviral therapy may clinically relevant may slowly regress cessation causal agent ( ) . If causal agent continue , however , cirrhosis may develop , reversal think rare .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 18 year old . Ability understand willingness provide write informed consent . Willingness undergo liver biopsy . Willingness comply study requirement procedures include storage blood liver tissue sample use future study HIV , AIDS , immune function , hepatic disease , relate disease . Established HIV diagnosis ( documentation HIV1 infection license ELISA test confirm Western Blot ) . For antiretroviral cohort combination antiretroviral therapy least 12 month stable regimen least 3 month prior enrollment . Chronically elevated transaminase least 6 month document elevate AST and/or ALT follow 3 occasion within 12 month prior enrollment : 1 . Screening ; 2 . Less 6 month ( 24 week ) prior enrollment ( distinct screening ) ; 3 . More 6 month prior enrollment . Note : Occasions must least 8 week apart . Specific screen lab criterion : AST and/or ALT great upper limit normal ; Absolute neutrophil count great 750/mm ( 3 ) ; PT/PTT within normal range ; Platelets great 50,000/uL ; Hemoglobin great equal 10 mg/dL ; Creatinine le equal 2.0 mg/dL ; Negative serum urine pregnancy test female childbearing potential . Willingness avoid medication contain aspirin 7 day PRIOR liver biopsy nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug 3 day PRIOR liver biopsy . Willingness avoid medication contain aspirin week AFTER liver biopsy . Willingness avoid medication herbal supplement ( e.g. , gingko biloba ) may increase risk bleed liver biopsy , direct study team . Willingness restrict activity 72 hour liver biopsy . Have primary care physician . HIV monoinfected individual previous liver biopsy evaluate chronically elevated transaminase antiretroviral therapy another indication may allow enroll study purpose obtain additional information predictor liver disease observe natural history . In instance , investigator attempt access tissue review . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Chronic hepatitis B infection ( define positive HBsAg hepatitis B viral load great 10,000 copies/ml ) . Hepatitis C infection ( define positive HCV viral load ) history treatment chronic hepatitis C. Acute Hepatitis A infection ( define HAV IgM positive ) . Suspected rhabdomyolysis ( e.g. , markedly elevate AST elevate CPK ) . Known suspected autoimmune hepatitis . Known suspected biliary disease , primary biliary cirrhosis sclerosing cholangitis . Known suspect Wilson 's disease , alpha1antitrypsin deficiency , celiac disease . History primary hemochromatosis , glycogen storage disease , amyloidosis , cystic fibrosis . Clinical evidence decompensated liver disease ( e.g. , jaundice , ascites , esophageal varix , hepatic encephalopathy ) . Active clinical pancreatitis . Chronic renal disease . Morbid obesity ( BMI great equal 40 ) , judge contradiction percutaneous liver biopsy AFP great equal 100 ng/mL . Hepatoma hepatocellular carcinoma . Pregnancy . Active opportunistic infection ( except oral thrush ) neoplasm ( except Kaposi 's sarcoma , skin cancer , cancer cervix anus , unless know suspected liver metastasis ) . Severe psychiatric disorder would interfere adherence protocol requirement . Individuals stable psychiatric condition may eligible . Decompensated cardiac pulmonary disease limit physical activity ( e.g. , New York Heart Association Heart Failure Class 2 high ) . History unexplained bleeding . Allergy lidocaine . Current use history treatment interleukin2 , interferonalpha investigational agent ( ) within 6 month protocol screen . However , antiretroviral medication obtain expand access program permit . Current use history treatment systemic corticosteroid , immunosuppressive cytotoxic agent within 90 day protocol screen . However , volunteer receive one day corticosteroid therapy 90 day prior screen eligible . Any medical condition investigator believe liver biopsy may contraindicate .</criteria>
