	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Ibandronate zoledronate may help relieve symptom cause bone metastasis . It yet know whether ibandronate effective zoledronate treat bone metastasis breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study ibandronate see well work compare zoledronate treat patient newly diagnose bone metastasis breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibandronate Zoledronate Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Bone Metastases From Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy , term reduce frequency time skeletal-related event ( SREs ) , ibandronate v zoledronate patient newly diagnose bone metastases secondary breast cancer . Secondary - Compare median time first SRE patient treat regimen . - Compare percentage patient experience SRE treatment regimen . - Compare number occult vertebral fracture present patient end treatment regimen . - Compare pain analgesic score quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare number patient develop renal dysfunction hypocalcemia study period . - Compare number patient develop osteonecrosis jaw study treatment follow-up . - Compare overall survival patient 96 week 5 year . - Compare health-resource usage patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , parallel-group , control , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive zoledronate IV 15 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21* 28 day least 96 week ( 24 32 course ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients receive concurrent chemotherapy every 3 week receive study treatment every 21 day - Arm II : Patients receive oral ibandronate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day least 96 week ( 24 course ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients bone pain hypercalcemia study entry require IV therapy due hypercalcemia study may receive 1 treatment ibandronate IV discretion supervise clinician . Quality life pain assessed baseline , every 3 course , completion study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow annually 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,400 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
