	<brief_title>Study Tests Whether Standardized LVR Performed With Blue Egg Device Improves Cardiopulmonary Exercise Capacity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study test whether standardized Left Ventricular Reconstruction ( LVR ) perform Blue Egg device improve cardiopulmonary exercise capacity subject stable New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV heart failure due ischemic cardiomyopathy akinetic dyskinetic anterior wall . This shall accomplish compare change cardiopulmonary exercise group subject treat LVR optimal medical therapy ( Treatment ) group treat optimal medical therapy alone ( Control ) . Secondary objective examine difference heart failure symptom two group . The primary hypothesis average change peak oxygen consumption ( MVO2 ) observe treatment group baseline 6 month post surgery date least 1.2 ml O2/min/kg great average change observe control group time frame .</detailed_description>
