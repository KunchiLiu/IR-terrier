	<detailed_description>Altitude affect human health well effect tissue oxygenation alter partial pressure oxygen gas enters lung . The partial pressure component mixed gas equal total pressure gas multiply fraction gas make component -- approximately 78 % nitrogen 21 % oxygen air altitude . As altitude increase , total air pressure decrease consequently , partial pressure component gas , include oxygen , decrease . As air inhale , becomes saturated water vapor body tissue , reduce partial pressure oxygen . Tissue oxygenation , measure term partial pressure oxygen arterial blood ( paO2 ) , directly relate partial pressure oxygen gas enter lung . The United States Federal Aviation Agency require commercial aircraft design barometric pressure cabin maximum cruise altitude exceed find external atmosphere 8,000 foot ( 565 mm Hg ) .1 The scientific basis limit unclear . Although large body knowledge concern effect altitude human , involve healthy young people altitude high 8,000 foot . An investigation effect altitude commercial airline passenger perform McFarland 1937 find “ …older person 72 year age respond moderate altitude , i.e. , 16,000 foot , without unusual difficulties. ” However , author go conclude , “ The human factor analysis present would suggest comfort well-being airline passenger would significantly benefit near sea level condition possible . In event , cabin altitude 3,000 – 5,000 foot exceeded. ” 2 , 3 In 1986 , Committee Airliner Cabin Air Quality National Research Council ( NRC ) conclude , “ Similarly , decrease oxygen partial pressure ( pO2 ) occur 8,000 foot safe normal people , possibly hazardous patient COPD. ” 4 In report publish 2001 , NRC conclude research effect cabin pressure susceptible person give high priority.5 Acute Mountain Sickness ( AMS ) , syndrome characterize headache , anorexia , nausea , vomit , lassitude sleep disturbance , onset closely follow ascent altitude6 report 12 42 % visitor altitude range 6,300 10,000 foot mountain Colorado.7-12 The time course symptom report sufficient detail allow characterization onset first several hour arrival altitude . Hypoxia-related medical problem flight rare..13-18 However , unpublished statistical model 19 predicts 8,000 foot substantial proportion person whose age similar commercial aircraft passenger experience paO2s level use supplemental oxygen recommend various medical authorities.20-24 If recommendation use supplemental oxygen valid,25 , 26 possible exposure level hypoxia 20 hour ( maximum anticipate duration commercial aircraft flight segment ) could adversely affect comfort well passenger . Physical exercise demonstrate reduce blood oxygenation person normal abnormal pulmonary health.27-29 Some member aircraft crew perform moderate level work part job30-34 , exercise recommend alleviate discomfort experience result prolonged inactivity encounter flight . It unknown moderate exercise beneficial deleterious effect comfort well person altitude . The term “ comfort ” “ well ” commonly use imprecisely define . “ Comfort ” define “ ... circumstance one able concentrate fully select task . No attention give maintain well being. ” 35 “ Well ” define “ The state healthy , happy , prosperous. ” 36 This investigation measure single concept “ comfort well ” use follow factor Environmental Symptoms Questionnaire IV : Factor 1 , Cerebral Acute Mountain Sickness ; Factor 2 , Respiratory Acute Mountain Sickness ; Factor 5 , Distress.37 Low score indicate great degree comfort well high score . Mild hypoxia report cause asymptomatic change oxygen saturation , heart rate , blood pressure , visual function , short term memory , fine motor coordination.38-41 Unpublished study find asymptomatic disorder control pupillary muscle , possibly due imbalance sympathetic parasympathetic nervous control.42 7 .
