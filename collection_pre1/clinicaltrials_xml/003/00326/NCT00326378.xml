	<brief_summary>Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) lead cause death Korean men stomach cancer . Surgical resection play main role curative treatment . However , less 20 % NSCLC patient find stage I-II disease . In inoperable stage IIIA/B disease , recommend treatment combine chemotherapy radiation therapy . Various kind combination 2 modality use either sequential concurrent set . Concurrent chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) recognize good survival radiation therapy alone sequential therapy , additional consolidation chemotherapy CCRT yet determine beneficial role survival gain . Docetaxel anticancer drug synergistic anticancer effect various cancer cisplatin , another anticancer drug . In present study , randomise trial perform confirm efficacy consolidation chemotherapy docetaxel cisplatin complete CCRT chemotherapeutic agent stage III inoperable NSCLC progression free survival overall survival .</brief_summary>
