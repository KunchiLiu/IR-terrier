	<brief_summary>In study compare two form radiotherapy . This study do clear present time whether intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) reduce side effect radiotherapy compare standard radiotherapy ( call 3D-Conformal Radiotherapy ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>3D-Conformal Radiation v Helical Tomotherapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radical radiation therapy play important role management prostate cancer , yield comparable long-term outcome surgery . Unfortunately , long term disease free survival data use PSA criterion show less 50 % high-risk patient free disease 10 year . To improve result conventional dose radiotherapy dose escalation three-dimensional conformal radiation employ . Due irregular shape prostate variable motion organ substantial radiation adjacent normal surround tissue treatment result radiation-induced toxicity . Intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) new form radiation therapy . Preliminary evidence suggest IMRT improves dose distribution radiation therapy prostate . The hypothesis study IMRT deliver use Helical Tomotherapy reduce late toxicity radical radiotherapy compare three-dimensional conformal radiation ( 3DCRT ) high-risk prostate cancer patient .</detailed_description>
