	<brief_title>A Long-Term Safety Study Evaluate Methylphenidate HCL Tablets Multiple Dose Levels Adults With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , open-label , dose-titration , long-term study evaluate long-term safety five dose level methylphenidate HCL extended-release tablet , 36 mg , 54 mg , 72 mg ( two 36 mg tablet ) , 90 mg ( one 36 mg tablet plus one 54 mg tablet ) , 108 mg ( two 54 mg tablet ) per day adult ADHD . At baseline visit , patient initiate treatment 36 mg methylphenidate HCL extended-release tablet . The dose increase 18 mg increment every seven day ( +/-2 day ) individualize dose achieve . An individualized dose achieve least 30 % improvement ADHD Investigator Symptoms Rating Scale ( AISRS ) Clinical Global Impression - Improvement ( CGI-I ) score 1 2 , maximum dose 108 mg achieve . If limiting adverse event occurs , dose titrate downward 18 mg . This dose individualized dose . Once individualized dose achieve , patient remain dose approximately six month one year , assign time enrollment . Patients give prescription one-month supply drug pharmacy card visit . Safety assessment include monitor adverse event , blood pressure , pulse , weight , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) throughout study . The study hypothesis methylphenidate HCL extended-release tablet dose 36 mg , 54 mg , 72 mg , 90 mg , 108 mg per day acceptable safety profile management ADHD adult . Patients start treatment 36 mg extended-release tablet methylphenidate HCL per day . The dose increase 18 mg increment every 7 day ( +/-2 day ) achieve individualize dose reach maximum dose 108 mg daily . Following patient 's titration , patient remain individualized dose approximately 6 month one year determine time enrollment .</detailed_description>
