	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study sunitinib malate sorafenib tosylate see well work compare placebo treat patient kidney cancer remove surgery . Sunitinib malate sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving sunitinib malate sorafenib tosylate surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether sunitinib malate sorafenib tosylate effective placebo treat kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Kidney Cancer That Was Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate improvement disease-free survival locally advance renal cell carcinoma patient randomly assign adjuvant sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) ( Arm A ) sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) ( Arm B ) versus placebo ( Arm C ) radical partial nephrectomy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival patient randomize two regimen placebo . II . To define toxicity prolong administration sunitinib sorafenib patient population . III . To evaluate cardiac function arm OTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES : I . To prospectively collect tumor biological specimen assess characteristic association : novel approach assess angiogenesis marker tissue , blood urine predictor disease-free survival therapeutic benefit . II . To prospectively collect tumor biological specimen assess characteristic association : frequency oncogene tumor suppressor gene mutation predictor disease-free survival therapeutic benefit . III . To prospectively collect tumor biological specimen assess characteristic association : tumor genetic polymorphism predictor disease-free survival therapeutic benefit . IV . To prospectively collect tumor biological specimen assess characteristic association : deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation profile predictor outcome therapeutic benefit . V. To prospectively collect tumor biological specimen assess characteristic association : The relationship polymorphisms drug metabolize enzyme steady state concentration sorafenib sunitinib select patient . VI . To study effect vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) target therapy circulate endothelial cell circulate endothelial progenitor . VII . To prospectively assess patient-reported fatigue order compare magnitude trajectory fatigue among renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) patient randomize adjuvant sunitinib ( Arm A ) sorafenib ( Arm B ) placebo ( Arm C ) . ( Quality life objective ) VIII . To evaluate Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System ( PROMIS ) Fatigue-Short Form ( SF ) 1 , newly develop state-of-the-science PROMIS measure fatigue calibrate PROMIS Fatigue-SF1 establish , validate Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy ( FACIT ) -Fatigue scale . ( Quality life objective ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM A : Beginning 4-12 week follow radical partial nephrectomy , patient receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 4 week placebo sorafenib tosylate PO QD twice daily ( BID ) 6 week . ARM B : Beginning 4-12 week follow radical partial nephrectomy , patient receive sorafenib tosylate PO QD BID 6 week placebo sunitinib malate PO QD 4 week follow . ARM C : Beginning 4-12 week follow radical partial nephrectomy , patient receive placebo sorafenib tosylate Arm A placebo sunitinib malate Arm B . In arm , treatment repeat every 6 week 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
