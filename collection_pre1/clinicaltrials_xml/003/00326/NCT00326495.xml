	<detailed_description>Background : Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) major public health problem ; 5-year survival widespread metastatic disease le 5 % . Expression epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) up-regulation gene occur 60-80 % case . Therapies target EGFR , like cetuximab , show activity treatment solid tumor like CRC . Cetuximab Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve treatment EGFR-expressing CRC , clinical response cetuximab see 10 % EGFR-expressing CRC . Recent data strongly implicate KRAS ( Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ) mutation mechanism resistance anti-EGFR antibody therapy cetuximab . Another major pathway implicate colon carcinogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) pathway , involve angiogenesis validate target therapy CRC . BAY 43-9006 Raf kinase inhibitor inhibitor VEGF receptor ( VEGFR2 ) tyrosine kinase . We hypothesize combined inhibition EGFR , VEGFR2 , Ras-Raf pathway demonstrate promise clinical activity CRC ; furthermore , patient mutant KRAS , combination cetuximab drug inhibits Raf kinase act downstream Ras mutation , could restore tumor sensitivity cetuximab . Objectives : To determine rate response ( CR ( complete response ) +PR ( partial response ) +SD ( stable disease ) 4 month ) toxicity profile combination BAY 43-9006 cetuximab previously treat EGFR-expressing metastatic CRC patient mutant KRAS . To evaluate BAY 43-9006 pharmacokinetics &amp; pharmacogenomics ( CYP3A4/5 ) . To evaluate combination treatment pharmacodynamics tumor biopsy , effect tumor vascularity , effect angiogenic cytokine . Eligibility : Adults histologically cytologically document , measurable , EGFR-expressing metastatic CRC , recur progress follow least one prior Fluorouracil ( 5FU ) -based combination chemotherapy regimen administer treatment metastatic disease . Patients must KRAS mutation-positive Design : BAY 43-9006 administer 400 mg mouth twice daily . Cetuximab administer 400 mg/m^2 load dose ( week 1 ) follow 250 mg/m^2 intravenous ( IV ) weekly . Optional PET ( positron emission tomography ) /CT ( compute tomography ) imaging ( 89 ) Zr-labeled , EGFR-targeting antibody panitumumab may perform evaluate radiation dosimetry , safety , tumor distribution prior follow treatment study agent . Patients evaluate response every 8 week use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumor ( RECIST ) criterion . This trial use phase II optimal design target response rate define 20 % patient mutant KRAS . Up 49 patient may treat . Patients stratify tumor KRAS status ( wild type vs. codon 12/13 mutation KRAS ) . Optional correlative ( 89 ) Zr-panitumumab PET/CT imaging may perform 20 participant . For first 5 patient , ( 89 ) Zr-panitumumab administer baseline ( within 10 day prior start cetuximab ) . PET/CT image perform 4 time : 2-6 hour follow ( 89 ) Zr-panitumumab injection , 1-3 day follow injection , 7-8 day follow injection , end cycle 1/beginning cycle 2 , obtain human dosimetry calculation . If uptake tumor show measurable first 5 patient , 15 subsequent patient administer ( 89 ) Zr-panitumumab cetuximab infusion ( within 10 day prior start cetuximab ) one PET/CT scan prior initial cetuximab infusion second ( 89 ) Zr-panitumumab infusion scan end cycle 1/beginning cycle 2 ( show schema ) . A diary provided subject record take study medication side effect .</detailed_description>
