	<brief_summary>This study determine whether treatment combination drug daclizumab denileukin diftitox eliminate need long-term daclizumab treatment adult patient uveitis . Denileukin diftitox kill white blood cell call lymphocyte cause inflammation may cause uveitis . Patients 18 year age old uveitis one eye daclizumab therapy disease flareup 6 month may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , eye examination ( include vision test , examination front eye , pupil dilation examination retina back eye ) , blood test questionnaire vision daily activity . After screen , participant undergo follow procedure : - Daclizumab/ denileukin diftitox treatment . Patients receive regular dose daclizumab intravenously ( vein ) . The interval dos increase 1 week dose . When dose 10 week apart , daclizumab stop . Patients experience flare uveitis treat intravenous denileukin diftitox possibly local injection steroids around eye increase add medicine need control uveitis . - Fluorescein angiography look blood vessel abnormality eye . A yellow dye inject arm vein travel blood vessel eye . Pictures retina ( back portion eye ) take special camera flash blue light eye . The picture show dye leak vessel retina , indicate possible abnormality . - Ultrasound urine test enrollment 1 year check kidney , lymph node pelvic area . - Blood test enrollment every 3-6 month laboratory immunology test research test blood cell examine immune response . - Follow-up visit approximately every 6 week 2 year repeat examination determine response treatment drug side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Daclizumab/Denileukin Diftitox Treat Uveitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose investigate possible efficacy combination daclizumab denileukin diftitox therapy induce peripheral immune tolerance participant present non-infectious intermediate posterior uveitis . This perform use Phase I/II pilot study . Subjects whose disease control daclizumab therapy daclizumab-dosing interval progressively increase one-week increment . If experience sign symptom ocular flare , treat denileukin diftitox , 24 hour receive usual dose daclizumab . Participants may receive 12 cycle daclizumab/denileukin diftitox therapy . When daclizumab-dosing interval 10 week long less 10 % CD4 T cell CD25 occupy daclizumab , therapy discontinue . Following discontinuation daclizumab patient follow recurrence ocular disease . Failure reach study point 12 cycle disease recurrence follow discontinuation therapy constitute study failure . The primary outcome ability participant successfully taper daclizumab disease remain quiet ( vitreous haze less equal Trace ) week 104 receiving concomitant systemic immunosuppressive medication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible enroll study , prospective participant must satisfy follow inclusion criterion . 1 . Participant 18 year age old . ( The vast majority T cell produce adulthood longterm consequence induce immune tolerance unknown , would thus seem prudent exclude juvenile study . ) 2 . Participant uveitis one eye daclizumab therapy without disease flare past 6 month . 3 . Participants reproductive age agree use acceptable birth control method throughout course study 6 month completion treatment daclizumab sirolimus . 4 . Participant must willing prepared travel NIH short notice treatment hospitalize deem medically necessary . 5 . Participant able understand sign consent form enter study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible enroll study , prospective participant must satisfy follow exclusion criterion . 1 . Participant history hypersensitivity denileukin diftitox . 2 . Participant pregnant lactating . 3 . Participant active chronic acute infection . 4 . Participant history cardiovascular disease , significant respiratory disease , coagulation disorder , major medical illness may limit ability tolerate toxicity associate denileukin diftitox . 5 . Participant serum albumin less 3.0 . 6 . Participant malignancy squamous cell carcinoma situ .</criteria>
