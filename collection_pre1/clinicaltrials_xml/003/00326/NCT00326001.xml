	<brief_title>Isthmus Ablation With Gold Electrode Treatment Atrial Flutter ( AURUM 8 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transvenous catheter ablation become therapy choice patient recur , isthmus-dependent right atrial flutter . Achieving bidirectional conduction block cavotricuspid isthmus decisive acute long-term therapy success essentially depend select ablation method lesion size . By use 8 mm tip electrode instead conventional 4 mm electrode , deep lesion make , thus significantly reduce require number energy application achieve bidirectional conduction block . Experimental study prove use ablation electrode make gold alloy allow creation deeper lesion conventional platinum-iridium electrode . Due great heat conductivity gold alloy oppose platinum-iridium , cool ablation electrode improve electric energy transmit tissue identical temperature . The combination technology form 8 mm-long gold electrode anticipate lesion depth require isthmus block achieve quickly comparison platinum-iridium electrode .</detailed_description>
