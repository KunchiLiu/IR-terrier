If seizure persist , EMS may give second medication transport patient ED per establish protocol . All parents/guardians participate study ask fill `` Pre-study Form '' ( fill enrollment study ) `` Parent Form '' every seizure treat study medication . They give stamp return envelope return questionnaire . Once study medication use , do study . Any need home rescue medication treat acute seizure activity coordinate neurologist . If question arise , study coordinator available phone . In addition , parents/guardians contact phone every two month question clinic visit audit compliance reporting seizures/hospitalizations , adverse event answer question arise . The study packet also instruct family call study coordinator immediately expect unexpected complication occur . The study coordinator call ED visit hospitalization .
