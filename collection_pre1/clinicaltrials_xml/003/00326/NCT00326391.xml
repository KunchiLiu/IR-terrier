	<brief_title>A Safety Effectiveness Study Methylphenidate HCl Extended-release Tablets Adults With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , placebo-controlled , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug placebo take ) , parallel-group , dose-titration , multicenter study determine effectiveness safety five dos methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablet , 36 mg , 54 mg , 72 mg ( two 36 mg tablet ) , 90 mg ( one 36 mg tablet plus one 54 mg tablet ) , 108 mg ( two 54 mg tablet ) administer orally per day adult Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . Patients randomize receive either placebo methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablet seven week . Patients assigned methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablet start treatment 36 mg continue receive incremental increase 18 mg methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablet every seven day ( +/-2 day ) individualize dose achieve . The individualized dose achieve Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale ( AISRS ) decrease 30 % Clinical Global Impression - Improvement ( CGI-I ) score 1 2 , titration maximum dose 108 mg achieve . If limiting adverse event occurs , dose titrate downward 18 mg . This dose patient 's individualized dose . Once individualized dose achieve , patient remain dose duration titration period two week prior Final Visit/2-Week Efficacy Assessment Visit . Patients assign placebo follow dose schedule procedure patient randomized methylphenidate HCl tablet . Safety assessment include monitor adverse event , blood pressure , pulse , weight , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) throughout study . The primary hypothesis methylphenidate HCL extended-release tablet individualize dose superior placebo respect improvement primary efficacy endpoint define change baseline Adult ADHD Investigator Symptom Rating Scale . Patients initiate methylphenidate HCl extended-release tablet 36 mg continue receive increase 18 mg increment 7 day individualize dose maximum dose 108 mg achieve . Patients remain dose duration titration period 2 week prior Final Visit/2 Week Efficacy Assessment ; maximum 51 day . Patients receive placebo follow dose schedule/procedures patient receive methylphenidate HCL tablet</detailed_description>
