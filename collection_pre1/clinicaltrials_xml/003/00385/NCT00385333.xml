	<brief_summary>This study test whether new non-invasive technique quickly precisely measure retinal metabolism ( amount energy retinal cell use ) . The retina part eye send information brain . Participants current NEI study age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , diabetic retinopathy , von Hippel-Landau disease may eligible study . Healthy volunteer participate control . Patients AMD must 60 year age old ; VHL disease diabetic retinopathy must 18 old . Participants undergo test procedure require NEI study previously enrol . In addition , current study , undergo metabolic mapping . For procedure , subject 's eye dilate , different amount low-level light shone eye see different cell respond change metabolism . Measurements take subject breathes room air breathe medical grade oxygen 1 minute . The entire procedure take 15 minute .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background . Alterations retinal metabolism associate blinding condition vision loss . We propose apply non-invasive vivo retinal imaging system investigate key physiologic process affect retinal metabolism . The imaging system design quantify characterize topology retinal metabolism 3-dimensional space across 40 -- 130 picosecond time period allow dynamic measurement physiologically relevant event . Objectives . The primary objective study : ( 1 ) evaluate utility system clinical setting ; ( 2 ) examine variation retinal metabolism within retinal cell subtypes environmental condition optimize support metabolism . The work hypothesis first objective imaging system easily efficiently implement clinical set yield stable repeatable result . The working hypothesis second objective people high risk progression sight threaten retinal disease exhibit different metabolic profile age- sex-matched disease-free comparison group . Their peer less severe disease may exhibit difference severe diseased non-diseased group . The long-term goal project address follow research question : Are metabolic profile generate image system effective determine presence severity retinal disease ? ; , metabolic profile useful identify people risk progression sight threaten form retinal disease ? Study Population . We first apply system 3 group 10 people exhibit range severity retinal disease influence retinal metabolism ; disease : age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) ; diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) ; von-Hippel-Lindau ( VHL ) disease . Design . Cross-sectional sample design . If system yield accurate , stable , repeatable result apply longitudinal study evaluate prognostic utility estimate risk progression sight-threatening AMD , DR , VHL disease . Outcome Measures . The magnitude 3-D topographic profile fluorescence anisotropy value across physiologically meaningful time period 20 degree field center macula . Fluorescence anisotropy system provide measure retinal metabolism .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : GENERAL INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Ability willingness provide inform consent . 2 . Presence natural lens study eye ( ) . 3 . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , cooperation sufficient perform measurement . 4 . All participant ability read least 1 eye AMDSPECIFIC INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants range AMD little drusen either eye end stage AMD ( geographic atrophic , retinal pigment epithelial detachment , sign neovascular/exudative disease ) one eye . Participants classify AREDS System Classifying AgeRelated Macular Degeneration exhibit range severity AMD least half exhibit unilateral advanced AMD ( geographic atrophy neovascular AMD ) half high risk progression . Inclusion criterion follow : 1 . A diagnosis AMD . We use AREDS criterion diagnostic scale definition AMD . 2 . Men woman age 60 year old . Children include AMD ( definition ) disease afflict adult . 3 . Eligible participant may evidence AMD little drusen either eye , may stage AMD end stage ( geographic atrophic , retinal pigment epithelial detachment , sign neovascular/exudative disease ) one eye . DRSPECIFIC INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . People DR classify modify ETDRS scale ; participant range severity DR , least half classify severe nonproliferative DR category ( SNPDR ) . Efforts make recruit people unilateral SNPDR . 2 . Participants men woman age 18 year old diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) . Any one following consider sufficient evidence diabetes present : Current regular use insulin treatment diabetes . Current regular use oral antihyperglycemia agent treatment diabetes . Documented diabetes ADA guideline . VHLSPECIFIC INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Participants men woman age 18 year older genetic confirmation VHLdisease . 2 . People VHL disease exhibit range retinal lesion none severe . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : GENERAL EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Cataract surgery study eye . 2 . Glaucoma evidence optic nerve damage . 3 . Chronic requirement systemic ocular medication eye diseases AMD , DR , VHLdisease . 4 . Presence implant medical device may affect electromagnetic frequency ( EMF ) emission . Although equipment CE UL rat EMF emission would prudent exclude people implanted pacemaker , neural stimulators , insulin pump . 5 . Arrhythmia indicate medical record , may result instability measurement . 6 . History seizure . The scan mechanism system operate 12 Hz , may induce seizure ( n.b . 12Hz scan rate use Heidelberg HRTII HRA ) . 7 . Presence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) lung disease might make breathe 100 % O2 unsafe . 8 . Ocular disease ( AMD , DR , VHL ) confound assessment retina . These include limited central serous choroidopathy , optic atrophy , retinal vein occlusion , active uveitis , significant explain unexplained visual field loss , type retinopathy retinal degeneration . 9 . Vitreous hemorrhage . 10 . History renal failure require dialysis renal transplant . 11 . Existing condition opinion investigator would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) .</criteria>
