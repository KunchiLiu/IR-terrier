	<brief_title>Pilot Trial Acamprosate Treatment Cocaine Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective trial evaluate safety , tolerability efficacy acamprosate treatment 60 treatment seek cocaine dependent outpatient . The study exploratory , double-blind , placebo-controlled 9-week trial , 2-cell design ( 30 subject per cell ) either 1998 mg/day acamprosate ( 666 mg TID ) placebo give .

Primary Hypotheses : 1 . Efficacy : Acamprosate-treated subject demonstrate less cocaine use medication/placebo treatment phase , compare placebo-treated subject . Cocaine use measure self-report TLFB confirm urine assay benzoylecgonine ( BE ) 2 . Safety Tolerability : Acamprosate-treated subject placebo-treated subject report similar rate adverse event , assess weekly evaluation , physical exam laboratory test . Secondary Hypotheses : 1 . Acamprosate-treated subject , compare placebo-treated subject , report less craving cocaine , measure low score Brief Substance Craving Scale ( BSCS ) ( Somoza et al , 1995 ) Multiple Choice Procedure ( MCP ) ( Griffiths et al. , 1993 ) medication treatment phase . 2 . Acamprosate-treated subject , compare placebo-treated subject , report few withdrawal symptom , measure Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment ( Kampman et al. , 1998 ) . 3 . Acamprosate-treated subject , compare placebo-treated subject , report few mood anxiety symptom , measure Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) ( Hamilton , 1967 ) , Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) ( Hamilton , 1969 ) , Clinical Global Impression Scale ( CGI ) . 4 . Subjects highly acamprosate-adherent ( &gt; 80 % pill take , verified combine patient report blister card ) cocaine non-use day medication treatment phase , compare less acamprosate-adherent ( &lt; 80 % pill take ) .</detailed_description>
