	<detailed_description>4-week study ass asthma control measure lung function clinical feature , rhinitis treatment , subject-rated overall satisfaction treatment , safety outcome FLONASE™ 200mcg ( FPANS ) QD , Singulair 10mg ( MON ) QD , placebo QD add ADVAIR™ DISKUS™ 100/50mcg ( FSC ) BID Singulair 10mg ( MON ) QD add placebo DISKUS BID adolescent adult subject . Male female subject must symptomatic seasonal allergic rhinitis persistent asthma , FEV1 65-95 % predict use as-needed short-acting beta2-agonist allow ICS non-ICS controller therapy . Subjects replace short-acting beta2-agonist VENTOLIN™ HFA ( rescue ) enter 7-14 day run-in period continue use pre-study controller therapy . At Visit 2 , subject meet asthma rhinitis randomization criterion randomize double-blind treatment ADVAIR DISKUS 100/50mcg BID either FLONASE 200mcg QD , Singulair 10mg QD , placebo QD , placebo DISKUS BID Singulair 10mg QD . The co-primary efficacy measure mean change baseline endpoint AM PEF , compare FSC MON treatment group assess superiority compare FSC FSC+MON treatment group assess equivalence . Secondary efficacy measure rhinitis mean change baseline subject-rated daytime total nasal symptom score nighttime total nasal symptomatic score average Weeks 1-2 ( D-TNSSW1-2 N-TNSSW1-2 , respectively ) . Secondary efficacy measure asthma mean change baseline endpoint morning pre-dose FEV1 , percentage symptom-free day , percentage rescue-free day . Other measure include subject-rated overall satisfaction treatment , even PEF , asthma symptom score ( D-INSSW1-x , N-INSSW1-2 ) , average Weeks 1-2 . Descriptive measure include total individual nasal symptom score average Weeks1-4 . Safety measure include assessment clinical adverse event asthma exacerbation .</detailed_description>
