	<brief_title>A Study Determine Whether 2 Investigational Malaria Vaccines Are Safe , Protective Against Malaria Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>35 volunteer age 18 50 year enrol receive one 2 investigational malaria vaccine . The vaccine make malaria protein FMP2.1 mix 2 different adjuvant ( AS01B AS02A ) . Five volunteer get small ( 10 µg ) dose FMP2.1/AS01B since vaccine yet human . If safe , 15 volunteer get 50 µg FMP2.1 AS02A 15 get 50 µg FMP2.1 AS01B . All vaccine give IM deltoid non-dominant arm , every 1 month 3 month . After vaccination , subject follow clinical trial evaluation adverse event . 20 vaccinee ( 10 50 µg vaccine group ) undergo primary sporozoite challenge 14-30 day dose 3 via bite 5 malaria-infected mosquito . All subject blood slide prepare read check asexual P. falciparum parasitemia least daily begin day 5 post challenge . Beginning day 10 post challenge , subject check designated hotel , 24 hour evaluation care available 10 night . After hotel phase , follow-up visit ensure late development malaria fall ill ( thus consider protect ) . Any subject test positive malaria treat chloroquine . Efficacy readouts complete protection significant delay patency define &gt; 2 day median prepatent period 6 infectivity control . These 6 control receive vaccine enrol malaria-challenge order provide comparison group vaccinate individual .</detailed_description>
