	<detailed_description>Little information available cardiovascular effect robotically assist partial weight support treadmill train device Lokomat chronic incomplete spinal cord injure subject . Task-oriented aerobic exercise potential improve neuromuscular function cardiovascular metabolic fitness neurological population . Since spinal cord injured individual increase risk develop premature cardiovascular disease , investigation robotic-assisted intervention spinal cord injury ( SCI ) Lokomat may important health benefit cardiovascular fitness well functional mobility . This proposal investigate hypothesis progressive aerobic exercise Lokomat feasible motor incomplete SCI , three month train improve cardiovascular fitness gait functionality compare physical therapy control . We propose two-phase study examine feasibility , reliability utility aerobic exercise metabolic test training robotically assist partial weight support treadmill walk individual chronic motor incomplete spinal cord injury ( CMISCI ) . During first phase study manipulate Lokomat training parameter treadmill speed percent partial weight support ass effect change heart rate , perceive exertion , oxygen consumption untrained chronic motor incomplete spinal cord injure subject . Subjects ask maintain cardiovascular muscular effort test monitor regard force biofeedback system build Lokomat . After determine threshold level initial cardiovascular response , submaximal peak exercise test attempt . These study repeat separate day determine reliability test result . Thirty-six subject vary level injury C4 L2 ASIA ( American Spinal Injury ) Impairment Scales C D recruit . We anticipate subject great ASIA motor score require either faster initial treadmill speed less partial weight support produce initial cardiovascular response . It also anticipate peak exercise test use open circuit spirometry subject Lokomat feasible , reliable valid measurement . This phase study aim establish guideline determine initial training parameter use aerobic exercise protocol use Lokomat . The second phase pilot study control trial three-month progressive aerobic Lokomat exercise chronic incomplete spinal cord injure subject . The aim trial determine whether progressive Lokomat training improve cardiovascular fitness ambulatory function compare match impairment severity CMISCI subject receive duration usual physical therapy care . Thirty-six subject recruit phase study . Open spirometric evaluation cardiovascular parameter outline phase one proposal measure baseline , 1 month , 3 month . Initial , six-week post-study ambulatory function evaluation include WISCI ( Walking Index Spinal Cord Injury ) , time 10 meter walk , measure walk 6 minute , gait analysis also determine . It hypothesize aerobic Lokomat exercise improve cardiovascular fitness determine increase VO2 ( oxygen consumption ) peak improve function determine timed walk gait parameter subject . The result pilot development study provide necessary information design large randomized clinical trial .</detailed_description>
