	<brief_summary>The main purpose study see Tarceva® ( erlotinib ) effective shrinking tumor . A high resolution CT scan ( CT scanner view 3 dimensional image tumor ) use measure tumor treatment Tarceva® ( erlotinib ) . This type CT scan measure tumor volume standard measurement ( length width ) . Both method compare find whether standard measurement measurement tumor volume accurate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Preoperative Tarceva ( Erlotinib ) Stages I/II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tarceva® ( erlotinib ) drug block receptor call Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) certain cell include tumor cell . Blocking receptor show shrink tumor patient . Tarceva® ( erlotinib ) approve commercial use U.S. Food Drug Administration treatment Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) failure least one chemotherapy treatment . However , approve first treatment Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) , treatment use study . Patients early stage non-small cell lung cancer receive daily Tarceva® ( erlotinib ) 150 mg/day 3 week follow surgical resection week 4 . High resolution CT scan tumor response assessment obtain baseline 3 week treatment Tarceva® ( erlotinib ) . Post-operative 2-year treatment Tarceva® ( erlotinib ) offer patient least 50 % ( half ) decrease size tumor treatment Tarceva® ( erlotinib ) and/or patient tumor find receptor , Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , tumor cell time surgery . Post-operative chemotherapy administer discretion treat physician patient stage IB II . Patients receive post-operative chemotherapy begin Tarceva ( erlotinib ) sooner 3 week Day 1 last chemotherapy cycle longer 6 month surgery . Follow-up recurrence survival continue 2 year .</detailed_description>
