	<brief_title>RESTORE-IT-Study Rifalazil Chlamydia Pneumoniae Seropositive Patients With History Atherosclerotic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate effect treatment rifalazil versus placebo take weekly 12 week carotid atherosclerotic disease progression patient test positive Chlamydia pneumoniae . Measurements carotid artery wall ( intima-media thickness ) plaque characteristic evaluate high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) carotid ultrasound . Baseline 6,12 18 month follow initiation drug treatment Chlamydia pneumoniae seropositive patient history atherosclerotic disease . Biomarkers collect throughout study . Safety evaluate collection analysis laboratory parameter , vital sign , electrocardiogram , physical examination adverse event . Seventy two patient enrol study . There total approximately 7-9 visit occur 18 month period .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Male female patient 50 85 year age . Patient seropositive evidence C. pneumoniae define IgG antibody titer ≥ 1:128 microimmunofluorescence assay . The patient meet least one follow criterion : 1 . Diagnosis PAD : i. Anklebrachial index ( ABI ) &lt; 0.90 rest either leg , toe brachial index &lt; 0.7 ankle pressure calcify . ii . Known PAD basis history symptom intermittent claudication , prior endovascular surgical revascularization . 2 . Known large vessel ( noncardioembolic ) cerebrovascular event ( stroke TIA ) within last three year carotid stenosis &gt; 40 % ≤ 80 % Doppler ultrasound asymptomatic carotid artery disease define total plaque area &gt; 100 mm2and carotid stenosis ≤ 80 % Doppler ultrasound . 3 . Known coronary artery disease basis exercise tolerance test positive myocardial ischemia , history prior myocardial infarction ( great 6 month ) , prior percutaneous coronary intervention and/or surgical revascularization ( great 6 month ) . Patient maximal IMT measurement ultrasound either leave right common carotid artery ≥ 0.70 mm least one echogenic carotid plaque detectable either right leave side carotid artery . Patient able undergo magnetic resonance ( MR ) examination MR baseline image obtain suitable image quality analysis . If patient take cilostazol , pentoxifylline , approve drug treatment PAD and/or intermittent claudication take statin , patient medication least 6 month prior Screening . Patients recently discontinue medication PAD and/or intermittent claudication statin must “ washout ” least one month prior screen . Male female patient must agree use effective form birth control throughout study period . The patient lack evidence intermediate advance carotid atherosclerotic lesion heavily calcify plaque poor image quality carotid artery determine MRI lab . Patient critical limb ischemia evidence ischemic rest pain , ulceration , gangrene . Patient new , previously unrecognized clinically significant electrocardiogram ( ECG ) abnormality . Patient liver function test &gt; 3.0 time upper limit normal , serum creatinine &gt; 1.8 mg/dL female &gt; 2.0 mg/dL male eGFR value &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 . Enrollment patient eGFR value 30 59 mL/min/1.73 m2 leave discretion investigator . Patients abnormal laboratory value deem clinically significant investigator enrol . Patient recent ( &lt; 6 month ) coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) , carotid endarterectomy ( CEA ) , carotid artery stent , low extremity revascularization/amputation . Patient plan surgical/endovascular intervention carotid and/or coronary course study . Patient evaluate treated tuberculosis . Patients treat previously tuberculosis presently inactive disease may include . Patient chest xray obtain within last month consistent possible tuberculosis . Patient history malignant neoplasm within previous 5 year ( except curable nonmelanoma skin malignancy ) . Patient known immunodeficient state treat immunosuppressive drug include highdose steroid cyclosporine . Patient active infection require systemic oral antibiotic . Patients prior infection must discontinue treatment least 14 day prior administration investigational agent . Patient uncontrolled , unstable recently diagnose autoimmune disease , include limited systemic lupus , inflammatory bowel disease , sarcoidosis , rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis . Patient recent history alcohol abuse , illicit drug use drug abuse significant mental illness . Patient know suspect allergy study medication ( ) class study medication ( rifamycins ) . Patient chronically use antibacterial previously receive rifalazil . Patient know suspect allergy MRI contrast agent ( e.g. , gadolinium ) and/or medical physical condition would prevent receive gadoliniumbased contrast agent MRI examination . Patient participate clinical trial investigational drug , device , medical procedure within 30 day prior Baseline study . Patient enrol plan enroll another clinical drug device/interventional trial study .</criteria>
