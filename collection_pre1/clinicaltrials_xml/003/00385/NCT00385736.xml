	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Adalimumab Subjects With Moderately Severely Acute Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind ( DB ) , placebo-controlled trial design evaluate efficacy safety human anti-TNF monoclonal antibody adalimumab induction clinical remission participant moderately severely active ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . Adult participant moderate severe UC ( Mayo score 6 12 point endoscopy subscore 2 3 point ) , confirm colonoscopy biopsy flexible sigmoidoscopy biopsy , enrol 80 site worldwide . The study enrol 576 participant , include 186 participant original protocol protocol Amendments 1 2 , 390 participant protocol Amendments 3 4 . Participants enrol study prior Amendment 3 randomize 1:1 ratio receive adalimumab placebo 12-week DB induction period . Participants receive 4 injection adalimumab 40 mg ( 160 mg ) 4 injection placebo Baseline ( Week 0 ) , follow 2 injection adalimumab 40 mg ( 80 mg ) 2 injection placebo Week 2 , follow 1 injection adalimumab 40 mg placebo Weeks 4 6 . At Week 8 , participant randomize placebo receive 4 injection adalimumab 40 mg ( 160 mg ) follow 2 injection adalimumab 40 mg ( 80 mg ) Week 10 . Participants randomize adalimumab receive 3 injection placebo 1 injection adalimumab 40 mg Week 8 1 injection placebo 1 injection adalimumab 40 mg Week 10 . All participant continue receive 1 injection open-label ( OL ) adalimumab 40 mg every week begin Week 12 Week 52 ( early termination visit ) . Starting Week 14 , participant inadequate response treatment ( define use partial Mayo score ) permit dose escalate adalimumab 40 mg weekly . Participants persistent inadequate response weekly treatment could discontinue study discretion investigator . In August 2007 , study design amend incorporate additional adalimumab induction dose arm 80/40 mg . Earlier year , 160/80-mg 80/40-mg induction regimens approve EU induction treatment Crohn 's disease . The adalimumab induction dose regimen 80/40 mg therefore include approved induction regimen would evaluate induction remission UC . Participants enrol study Amendment 3 randomize 1:1:1 ratio receive adalimumab ( 1 2 regimen ) placebo 8-week DB induction period . Participants receive DB therapy Baseline Week 8 OL therapy Week 8 end study . In first adalimumab dose arm ( adalimumab 80/40 ) , participant receive 2 injection adalimumab 40 mg ( 80 mg ) 2 injection placebo Baseline follow 1 injection adalimumab 40 mg 1 injection placebo Week 2 , 1 injection adalimumab 40 mg every week thereafter . In second adalimumab DB induction dose arm ( adalimumab 160/80 ) , participant receive 4 injection adalimumab 40 mg ( 160 mg ) Baseline follow 2 injection adalimumab 40 mg ( 80 mg ) Week 2 , 1 injection adalimumab 40 mg every week thereafter . Participants randomize placebo receive 4 injection placebo Baseline follow 2 injection placebo Week 2 , 1 injection placebo Weeks 4 6 . Beginning Week 8 , Week 8 study assessment complete , participant receive 1 injection OL adalimumab 40 mg every week Week 52 early termination . Starting Week 12 , participant inadequate response treatment ( define use partial Mayo score ) permit dose escalate adalimumab 40 mg weekly . Participants persistent inadequate response weekly treatment could discontinue study discretion investigator . For analysis efficacy parameter DB Period Week 8 , participant randomize Protocol Amendment 3 later consider ( `` Efficacy Analysis Set - Induction '' participant flow ) . For analysis efficacy parameter OL Period Week 52 , randomize participant ( version protocol ) receive least 1 dose study drug consider ( `` Efficacy Analysis Set - Maintenance '' participant flow ) . For analysis safety parameter , participant receive least 1 dose study drug consider ( `` Safety Analysis Set '' participant flow ) . Twelve rank secondary variable DB Period Week 8 test hierarchical order account multiple testing . These variable identify `` Ranked Secondary Endpoints '' result section . Additionally , non-ranked secondary variable OL Period Week 52 test present ranked secondary endpoint result section .</detailed_description>
