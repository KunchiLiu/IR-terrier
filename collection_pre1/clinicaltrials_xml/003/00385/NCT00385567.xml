	<brief_summary>HRG2 Phase 2 randomize , control , open-label , multi-dose trial determine efficacy , safety , immunogenicity , pharmacokinetic profile PEHRG214 HIV-infected patient , treat three time weekly 16 week . All patient receive optimized standard care HAART . The primary objective study determine effect PEHRG214 decrease viral load ( &gt; =1.0 log10 ) , compare Control group . The primary hypothesis treatment PEHRG214 result clinically meaningful sustained viral load suppression . The total sample size 70-74 patient approximately 8-10 participate study center . The first 16-20 patient enrol non-randomized `` pilot arm '' 54 subsequent patient randomize ( 2:1 within center ) Treatment Control group . The total study duration 7-12 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design randomize , control , open-label multi-dose trial PEHRG214 administer intravenously three time weekly , potential dose escalation select patient . Patients HIV infection , viral load least 10 time great site laboratory 's low limit detection CD4 count &lt; 220 cells/mm3 , enter trial . All patient must take optimized background regimen ( OBR ) antiretroviral agent , confirm Principal Investigator , accordance U.S. Department Health Human Services Guidelines Use Antiretroviral Agents HIV-1 Infected Adults Adolescents , May 4 , 2006 . A non-randomized `` pilot arm '' 16-20 patient first receive 2.0 mg/kg three time weekly 12 dos . After `` pilot arm '' patient receive least 12 dos PEHRG214 2.0 mg/kg , dose escalation 4.0 mg/kg three time weekly follow scheme base adverse event , HAGAR , viral load assessment individual patient , certain case , review DSMB . After `` pilot arm '' patient receive 12 dos 4.0 mg/kg , subsequent patient enter protocol 4.0 mg PEHRG214/kg level . The subsequent 54 patient randomize , 2:1 ratio within center , Treatment group Control group , respectively . The treatment group receive PEHRG214 dose 4.0 mg/kg three time weekly 48 dos ( 16 week ) . The Control group receive investigational drug , undergo observation receive standard care HAART . After least 12 dos PEHRG214 4.0 mg/kg , dose escalation 8.0 mg/kg three time weekly follow scheme base adverse event , HAGAR , viral load assessment individual patient , certain case , review DSMB . The Control patient evaluate every 4 week 16 week accord Schedule Assessments Appendix 1F . After 16 week , patient option enrol extension protocol receive PEHRG214 .</detailed_description>
