	<brief_title>Proteomic Profiling Influenza Vaccination - FluMist</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This nonrandomized , non-comparative study conduct 50 healthy subject , 21 49 year age , vaccinate 1 dose ( 0.5 mL ) Influenza Virus Vaccine Live , Intranasal FluMistTM , live trivalent nasally administer vaccine . The central hypothesis immune response vaccination quantify proteomic profiling serum nasal protein , host response different infectious agent unique `` fingerprint '' proteomics . Using influenza virus vaccination , study proposes use mass spectrometry platform profile characterize protein serum sample obtain recipient . These sample use develop proteomic profiling system monitor vaccine response , eventually allow early detection/diagnosis infection . Annually , natural influenza infection cause serious international public health problem particularly severe elderly people , account 90 % influenza mortality . The current trivalent split virus influenza vaccine cost-effective , efficacy greatly reduce elderly population . The long-term goal investigator ' approach develop tool useful reduce morbidity mortality influenza natural potential bioterrorism-related infection improve measure vaccine efficacy early diagnosis . This study conduct Glennan Center Geriatrics Gerontology Eastern Virginia Medical School . Solicited adverse event ( AEs ) daily temperature collect diary card 21 day . Unsolicited AEs also collect throughout duration study . Blood drawn nasal swab collect subject 6 study visit . Subjects participate study approximately 1 month . The primary objective study analyze serum sample FluMist intranasal attenuate live-virus influenza vaccination identify surrogate marker reflective immune response use surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time flight ( SELDI-TOF ) matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time flight ( MALDI-TOF ) mass spectrometry proteomic profiling tool reflective immune response . Concurrent T-cell activation , cytokine assay , hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) serologic assays correlate cellular humoral response influenza vaccination protein profiling change . Proteins obtain intranasal swabs pre post vaccination analyze . The investigator anticipate identify multiple host response proteins analysis use combination gel electrophoresis , MALDI-TOF tandem MS/MS approach . The secondary objective safety . Data solicit reaction collect Day 0 Day 14 . The time occurrence AEs use determine correlation time increase certain protein biomarkers . The primary endpoint identify surrogate marker reflective immune response serum and/or nasal proteins correlate marker cellular humoral response ( demonstrate T-cell activation , cytokine assay , hemagglutination inhibition [ HI ] serologic assay ) influenza vaccination . The secondary endpoint safety . Data local reaction solicit systemic reaction collect Day 0 Day 14 categorize accord severity . Unsolicited AEs collect categorize throughout study severity , duration , relatedness vaccine . The time occurrence AEs use determine correlation time increase certain protein biomarkers .</detailed_description>

Subject currently treat immunosuppressive medication ( ie , cancer therapeutic agent tamoxifen , systemic corticosteroid prednisone , arthritis medication methotrexate ) . Please note inhale topical corticosteriods acceptable . 11 . FluMist recipient close contact ( eg , within household ) immunocompromised individual period immunosuppressed person require care protective environment . ( contact avoid least 21 day ) . Contact small child exclusion . Females breastfeed exclude . 12 . Drug interaction : On antiviral therapy 48 hour precede schedule vaccination 13 . Antiviral agent administer 3 week FluMist vaccination . 14 . Participation interventional drug vaccine trial within 30 day prior enrollment . Therefore subject receive investigational product ( drug vaccine ) length participation trial . 15 . Subject acute respiratory illness . Administration FluMist postpone acute phase ( least 72 hour ) respiratory illness . 16 . Subject active infection illness . 17 .
