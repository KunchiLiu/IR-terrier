	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Siltuximab ( CNTO 328 ) Male Subjects With Metastatic Hormone-Refractory Prostate Cancer ( HRPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2-part , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) multicenter ( 1 hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , Phase 2 study evaluate safety efficacy combination siltuximab plus mitoxantrone versus mitoxantrone participant metastatic HRPC receive 1 prior Docetaxel-based chemotherapy ( treatment disease , usually cancer , chemical agent ) regimen ( pattern give treatment ) . Part 1 study single arm participant receive mitoxantrone , prednisone siltuximab . Part 2 study randomize portion ( study drug assign chance ) , consist 2-arms . The experimental arm consist treatment mitoxantrone , prednisone siltuximab . The control arm consist treatment mitoxantrone prednisone . Mitoxantrone administer dose 12 milligram per square meter ( mg/m^2 ) intravenously ( vein ) 30-minute infusion ( fluid medicine deliver vein way needle ) Day 1 3-week cycle , disease progression unacceptable toxicity ( harmful effect drug ) 10 cycle ( maximum total dose approximately 120 mg/m^2 ) . Siltuximab administer dose 6 mg/kilogram intravenously 2-hour infusion , start Day 1 Cycle 1 continue every 2 week disease progression unacceptable toxicity maximum 1 year . All participant receive prednisone 5 mg twice daily start first administration Mitoxantrone . The duration treatment maximum 12 month cumulative dose . Radiologic assessment perform Week 12 first study agent dosing , every 9 week end treatment every 3 month document disease progression . Tumor ( mass specific area ) response assess use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . There short-term follow-up visit ( conduct monthly 2 month ) , follow long-term follow-up visit ( conduct every 3 month ) . Participants ' safety also monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
