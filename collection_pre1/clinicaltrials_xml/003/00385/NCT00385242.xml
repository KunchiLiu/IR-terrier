	<brief_summary>Rationale : Patients severe ventricular dysfunction coronary disease high morbidity mortality . They may benefit revascularization , significant peri-operative morbidity mortality . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) image F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) detect viable myocardium may recover revascularization patient . It unclear whether use FDG PET population improve outcome cost-effective . Objectives : The principal aim determine whether FDG PET-guided therapy effective versus standard care . Secondary objective determine whether FDG PET-guided therapy improve LV function , quality life good value money versus standard care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients severe ventricular dysfunction coronary artery disease high morbidity mortality may benefit revascularization . However , also significant peri-operative morbidity mortality among patient . This account variable approach patient different cardiac centre . Clearly patient group gain coronary revascularization beneficial , also lose helpful . There need approach well define patient severe ventricular dysfunction due ischemia , likely benefit revascularization . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) image F-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) use evaluate patient ventricular dysfunction , detect ischemic viable myocardium likely recover revascularization . Recently retrospective study show FDG PET identify patient high risk cardiac event undergo revascularization . However , study evaluate whether FDG PET actually direct therapy decision study design , could determine whether FDG PET alter patient outcome . Our recent study show FDG PET important impact therapy decision patient ischemic viable myocardium increase risk . However remain unclear whether approach utilizes FDG PET define ischemic viable myocardium beneficial effect patient outcome . It also important consider potential clinical impact FDG PET balance limited availability . In addition , despite cost technology , preliminary data group others suggest potential cost saving . Accordingly , prospective randomize study need evaluate whether FDG PET direct therapy beneficial effect patient outcome cost-effective .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient &gt; 18 year age . Documented ejection fraction &lt; 35 % attributable CAD . Documented CAD Any patient consider revascularization , transplant/heart failure work , opinion attend physician surgeon , viability imaging would consider useful ongoing clinical management decision . Other comorbid condition make survival unlikely &lt; 6 week post myocardial infarction CAD unsuitable revascularization emergency revascularization require . severe valvular disease require surgery .
