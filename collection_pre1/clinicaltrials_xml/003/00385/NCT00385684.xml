METHODOLOGY : After consent , patient age 55 dementia reside nursing home care unit ( home receive care ) Tuscaloosa VAMC demonstrate significant discomfort ( measure Pain Assessment Advanced Dementia - PAINAD ) randomize one two group , use double-blind , double-dummy , placebo-controlled , crossover design . Patients randomly assign treatment either hydrocodone/acetaminophen 2.5mg/250mg q8hrs schedule placebo q8hrs PRN placebo q8hrs schedule hydrocodone/acetaminophen 2.5mg/250mg q8hrs PRN . After one week 's treatment , patient cross ( opposite ) regimen , total two week blind treatment . Patients tolerate treatment hydrocodone/acetaminophen eligible six-week , open-label continuation phase . The primary outcome measure pain/discomfort .
