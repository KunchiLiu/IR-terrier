	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn fludarabine , melphalan gemcitabine follow transplantation stem cell ( blood-forming cell ) well immune cell ( lymphocyte ) , collect match relate ( i.e . sibling ) unrelated donor , mismatch related donor , help control Hodgkin 's disease . The safety treatment also study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Central Venous Catheter : If choose take part study , chemotherapy , drug study , stem cell transplant immune cell give vein central venous catheter ( CVC ) . A CVC sterile flexible tube needle place large vein local anesthesia . Blood sample also draw CVC . The CVC remain body treatment . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form . Study Drug Administration : The day receive stem cell call minus day , Day -2 , Day -1 . The day receive stem cell call Day 0 . The day receive stem cell call plus day , Day +1 , Day +2 . On Day -7 , receive gemcitabine vein 40-180 minute . On Day -6 , admit hospital give fluid vein hydrate . On Days -5 -4 , receive fludarabine vein 30 minute . On Days -4 -3 , receive thymoglobulin , receive transplant match unrelated donor ( blood relative ) , mismatch relate donor ( blood relative , full match ) , also receive antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) On Days -3 -2 , receive fludarabine vein 30 minute melphalan 30 minute . On Day -1 , `` rest '' ( receive chemotherapy ) . On Day 0 , receive donor 's stem cell immune cell vein . The infusion last anywhere 30 minute several hour . You may give standard drug help low risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . All participant expect need blood transfusion part treatment . Beginning Day -2 , tacrolimus give vein 24 hour help low risk graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . This change pill tolerate swallow pill . If active cancer detect GVHD , swallow 1 tacrolimus pill day 3-4 month , instead usual period 6 month . This do boost donor immune system cancer . Starting 1 week transplant ( Day +7 ) , receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) injection skin 1 time day blood cell level return normal . Filgrastim design make white blood cell grow , may help fight infection . On Days +1 , +3 , +6 , +11 , receive methotrexate vein decrease risk GVHD . If persistent stable ( `` grow '' ) disease transplant , immunosuppressive medication ( tacrolimus , corticosteroid ) stop even 4 month . If response , receive infusion additional cell donor . Study Visits : About 30 day receive stem cell , compute tomography ( CT ) and/or positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan check status disease . About every day discharge , least weekly : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Follow-Up Visits : About 100 day transplant : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Part blood sample may use chimerism analysis ( determination donor recipient cell ) , need . - At point doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration , chest x-ray , CT and/or PET scan check status disease . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip site numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . About 6 month , 1 year , annually transplant : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Part blood sample may use chimerism analysis ( determination donor recipient cell ) , need . Part blood use check thyroid function year . - At point doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration , chest x-ray , CT and/or PET scan check status disease . - You may lung function test , doctor think need . - About 6 month transplant , may biopsy , doctor think need . - About year , eye exam . The tests/procedures may repeat often , doctor think need . The study staff also stay contact local doctor find disease come back check . Length Treatment : You study 3 year . After 1 year , study specific test required complete . Your transplant doctor perform routine standard care follow-up patient receive allogeneic stem cell transplantation receive . You may remove study early doctor think best interest , disease get bad come back , intolerable side effect occur , graft failure ( transplanted cell grow ) , unable follow study direction . If reason want leave study early , must talk study doctor . It may life-threatening leave study start receive study drug receive stem cell transplant blood cell count dangerously low . This investigational study . All drug use study FDA-approved commercially available . Up 70 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients &lt; 65 year age histologically confirm refractory relapse Hodgkin 's disease ( include patient fail relapse autologous SCT ) . This upper age limit apply transplant match related unrelated donor . 2 . Patients follow disease status : a. responsive stable disease salvage chemotherapy radiation therapy . b. untreated , smolder ( i.e . rapidly progressive ) relapse . 3 . Patients must serum bilirubin equal &lt; /=2.0 mg/dl ( isolated hyperbilirubinemia relate Gilbert 's disease allow ) , serum transaminase ( ALT ) equal &lt; /= 3 time upper limit normal range , serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl ( provide also glomerular filtration rate least 55 ml/min ) , symptomatic cardiac pulmonary disease performance status equal &lt; /=2 . Left ventricular ejection fraction &gt; /= 40 % , forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) , force vital capacity ( FVC ) correct diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) &gt; /= 50 % predict . 4 . Patients must HLAcompatible related unrelated donor ( oneantigen mismatch related donor acceptable ) willing donate marrow rhGCSFmobilized peripheral blood stem cell . In event transplant match unrelated donor , highresolution allele match HLAA , B , C , DRB1 ( `` 8 8 match '' ) require . 5 . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within two week study entry advise avoid become pregnant . Men advise father child treatment . Both woman childbearing potential men must agree practice effective method contraception . 6 . Patients must capable willing sign inform consent . 1 . Patients documented disease progression salvage chemotherapy . 2 . Nursing pregnant female . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 3 . Severe concomitant medical psychiatric illness . 4 . Uncontrolled arrhythmia symptomatic cardiac pulmonary disease . 5 . Chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis . 6 . Active uncontrolled infection . 7 . Radiation therapy involve chest ( axilla exclude ) , mediastinum , abdomen ( i.e. , small large bowel ) complete within 10 week transplant admission . Radiation therapy shortly start preparative regimen allow . 8 . Prior concurrent malignancy ( include myelodysplasia ) except resect basal cell carcinoma treat carcinoma insitu . Cancer treat curative intent &lt; 5 year previously allow unless approve Protocol Chair . Cancer treat curative intent &gt; 5 year previously allow .</criteria>
