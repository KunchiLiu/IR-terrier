	<detailed_description>Myocardial ischemia one leading cause mortality morbidity United States . The initial injury myocardium due state imbalance oxygen demand exceed supply . This pronounced case sudden total occlusion coronary artery result myocardial injury necrosis ( AMI ) . The main stay therapy case restoration flow ischemic myocardium mean reperfusion therapy thrombolysis mechanical revascularization . Interestingly , data suggest sudden restoration blood flow ischemic myocardium may cause another form myocardial injury , know reperfusion injury . Although initially controversial , reperfusion injury recognize distinct entity . This refer sudden brisk reperfusion ischemic myocardium may induce injury originally present-paradoxically exaggerate end result ischemic event . Reperfusion injury may increase infarct size , decrease myocardial contractile function induce exaggerate vascular endothelial dysfunction . The pathophysiology well understood , effect reperfusion injury attribute generation free oxygen radical increase oxidative stress possibly related abnormality nitric oxide synthase ( NOS ) enzyme byproduct . These cellular event lead endothelial dysfunction , pivotal event development reperfusion injury . A concept know pre-conditioning identified phenomenon limit extent severity reperfusion injury . Classically , precondition refers occurrence whereby repeat brief episode ischemia precede prolonged period ischemia result mark diminution ischemic injury injury occur reperfusion . The mechanism ischemic tolerance think secondary recruitment collateral circulation , note develop patient undergo serial balloon inflation angioplasty . The cellular mechanism involve ischemic precondition completely understood , may relate attenuation reperfusion injury . These finding also corroborate Kharbanda 's group finding make induce forearm ischemia 31 healthy volunteer . In attempt test effect ischemic precondition attenuation ischemia-reperfusion injury pertains endothelial function circulate blood cell function , forearm volunteer make ischemic 20 minute period use pneumatic blood pressure cuff 200 mmHg . This method compare use ischemic preconditioning prior prolong 20 minute ischemic episode . Ischemic preconditioning induce inflate pneumatic cuff 200 mmhg 5 minute deflate cuff . This repeat total 3 time . Radial artery reactivity test blood sample collect antecubital vein time interval cuff deflation method . It note ischemic -preconditioning prior prolong forearm ischemia prevent endothelial dysfunction neutrophil activation . Unfortunately , although pre-conditioning extensively study show reduce reperfusion injury animal human model , difficult practically apply patient-care setting . This time acute cardiac neurologic ischemic event difficult reliably predict . Accordingly , generate great interest theory know post-conditioning . Post condition ischemic post-conditioning concept whereby short , repetitive ischemic episode apply early reperfusion ischemic myocardium attenuate reperfusion injury . It appear pre-conditioning post-conditioning target pathophysiological mechanism , share effect final common pathway involve pathogenesis reperfusion injury . In recent study , effect ischemic post-conditioning compare ischemic preconditioning coronary circulation animal model . An open chest , leave anterior descend coronary artery occlusion model use 29 dot ( 10 control , 9 preconditioning , 10 post-conditioning ) . When compare control , intervention show protective myocardial effect . The strategy post-conditioning comparable result ischemic precondition regard reduction infarct size . Endothelial dysfunction sign early atherosclerosis , also major component ischemia-reperfusion injury . Several factor affect endothelial function , presence reactive oxygen specie vessel wall ability endothelium generate nitric oxide ( NO ) seem important determinant endothelial function . Due abnormality NOS , generation free oxygen radical increase , level NO decrease ischemic episode . This lead significant alteration endothelial function . Under ischemic condition , nitric oxide synthase produce superoxide ( .O2- ) excess nitric oxide ( NO ) . Superoxide react surround nitric oxide produce potent oxidize agent , peroxynitrite ( ONOO- ) . These oxygen radical think contribute development ischemia-reperfusion injury human . NO show play significant role reduce reperfusion injury human . The group institution demonstrate reperfusion injury forearm human subject attenuate administration tetrahydrobiopterin ( BH4 ) , cofactor NOS lead production NO ( unpublished data , Baballiaros et al. ) . The time course oxidative marker expression , NO , ischemia-reperfusion injury expect occur early 2.5 5 minute reperfusion . Several study examine time course NO , nitrosyl hemoglobin , glutathione reduction-oxidation , hydro peroxide . In study conduct Mochizuki et al , describe arterial flow mediate dilation model , NO attain peak value first-order time delay peak level NO concentration linearly correlate perfusion rate vessel . It must note , however , peak duration level somewhat variable depend perfusion flow diameter vessel . Endothelial function non-invasively evaluate use Brachial ( Radial ) artery reactivity test ( BART ) measure flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) . Since 's beginning 1989 , study FMD take expand role understand endothelial physiology . FMD endothelial dependent process reflect relaxation conduit artery expose shear stress . Increased flow , thereby increase shear stress , brachial artery occur post occlusive reactive hyperemia . Several study suggest maximal increase diameter occur approximately 60 second release occlusive cuff 45-60 second peak reactive hyperemia blood flow . The increase diameter time prevent NO synthase inhibitor , N-G monomethyl-L-arginine , indicate endothelial dependent process mediate NO . Other measure vasodilator response include time maximum response , duration vasodilator response , area dilation curve .An impairment endothelial function , via FMD assessment BART , show correlate risk factor coronary artery disease ( smoking , hyperlipidemia , diabetes mellitus ) adverse cardiovascular event . Currently , data show benefit post-conditioning reduce reperfusion injury animal model . However use post-conditioning human reduce reperfusion injury well investigated.Given endothelial dysfunction significant component reperfusion injury , propose examine effect post-conditioning reperfusion injury use BART . This study act pilot compare result Post-conditioning precondition reduce reperfusion injury BART human reperfusion injury model . The clinical relevance study paramount . If show post-conditioning attenuates reperfusion injury human , assess BART large scale trial ass post-conditioning prevention ischemia reperfusion injury human necessary . Furthermore , allow possible therapeutic application clinical setting , potentially provide post-conditioning measure patient undergo percutaneous coronary intervention abruptly occlude coronary artery . Attenuation reperfusion injury may reduce associate morbidity mortality acute coronary ischemic event .</detailed_description>
