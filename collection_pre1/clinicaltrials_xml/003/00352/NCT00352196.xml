	<brief_summary>This study open-label , 12-week trial risperidone subject Asperger 's Disorder , accord Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders IV ( DSM-IV ) Criteria . The study two arm , one involve pre- post-treatment MRS study , one without MRS . The MRS arm study 18-20 subject age 6 , target 14 completing patient . For arm , plan enroll total 30 patient achieve completion 24 patient . The non-MRS arm study include subject 6-18 year age , bulk complete study write updated revision . Our hypothesis treatment Asperger 's patient low dose risperidone : 1. decrease ratio N-acetylaspartate ( NAA ) , creatine , phosphocreatine ( Cr + PCr ) , choline prefrontal lobe , 2. decrease severity negative symptom overall improve social behavior , 3. two correlate . Specific Aims The primary objective trial : - Further assess investigate utility risperidone treatment Asperger 's disorder . - Assess efficacy risperidone normalize increase frontal lobe metabolite . - Assess efficacy risperidone normalize symptom Asperger 's disorder patient use standardized rating scale assess impact negative symptom social interaction . - Determine whether risperidone 's effect clinical improvement Asperger 's disorder , i.e. , negative symptom , correlate normalization frontal lobe metabolites - Accrue safety tolerability data risperidone population patient . This information could potentially use provide pilot data double blind trial</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN This study open-label , 12-week trial risperidone subject Asperger 's Disorder , accord DSM-IV Criteria . The study two arm , one involve pre- post-treatment MRS study , one without MRS . The MRS arm study 18-20 subject age 6 , target 14 completing patient . For arm , plan enroll total 30 patient achieve completion 24 patient . The non-MRS arm study include subject 6-18 year age , bulk complete study write updated revision . Subjects first undergo screen visit safety diagnostic assessment complete , minimum 3 day allow evaluate screening result . Then , subject complete one two practice session provide train achieve necessary stillness duration sufficient complete MRS session . Upon completion successful practice session , subject schedule MRS visit . Once MRS successfully complete , subject assign receive risperidone 0.25 mg baseline visit . Response risperidone measure week 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) . Additional secondary outcome measure show ( figure 1 ) . A post-treatment MRS conduct Week 12 early termination visit . Subjects give adequate medication supply cover day final MRS visit . Study Medication . Because Asperger 's Disorder diagnose childhood consider childhood disease , previous phase study focus subject age 6 - 18 . Published dosages risperidone use child , adolescent , adult study range 0.25 11 mg per day . Most study child adolescent begin start dose 0.25 mg bid , also appropriate adult , start dose plan study . The study progress fix titrate dose paradigm . After Week 6 , dose increase ( base response tolerability ) , range one two tablet twice daily ( either 1 2 mg risperidone daily ) . Again Week 9 , dose increase ( base response tolerability ) , range 1 mg 4 mg per day risperidone , one four tablet twice day risperidone . Patients trouble tolerate start dose may dose reduce 0.25 mg per day continue study . Patients tolerate 0.25 mg dosage would discontinue study order receive alternative treatment . Schedule Events Observations Screening Visit : A Structured Clinical Interview Diagnosis ( SCID ) conjunction DSM-IV criterion psychiatric history , allow study physician establish confirm diagnosis Asperger 's disorder . Medical history , vital sign , clinical lab { chemistry , complete blood count ( CBC ) , thyroid function , urinalysis , urine drug screen , blood pregnancy test ( fecund female ) } , physical exam , EKG perform determine patient safety . Blood Draws : Additional lab sample collect screen end study explore 1 ) effect diet treatment outcomes risperidone , 2 ) effect risperidone treatment level Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor ( BDNF ) Nerve Growth Factor ( NGF ) . The additional blood amount approximate total 8 tablespoon blood collect study . MRS Visits Practice Sessions : Subjects enrol MRS arm , schedule pretreatment MRS take place screen visit baseline visit prior start risperidone . Subjects also post-treatment MRS within 7 day week 12 visit study termination . Patients supply enough medication continue treatment MRS measure complete . Subjects may require , base investigator 's discretion , complete one two session screen period Practice Sessions MRS study well prepare subject level stillness need MRS study . The practice session last approximately one hour perform Medical College Georgia ( MCG ) Office Clinical Investigative Services , locate 1521 Pope Ave , Suite FF-100 . Practice Sessions may also perform MRI suite MCG allow subject see lie MRI machine , depend availability . Rationale practice session : We learn session may necessary help subject achieve stillness required MRS. During session , subject train remain still lie pad stretcher , use behavioral relaxation training technique perform qualified investigator . Other effort make simulate MRS environment may include play recorded sound MRI machine simulation pad head support . In case Practice Sessions , would do prior MRS visit , case fail MRS visit , investigator may choose schedule another practice session prior re-trying MRS visit . The practice session supplement standard effort use support patient ' compliance MRI procedure . For example , part hospital 's usual care MRI study include option patient wear video goggles headphone . Subjects study may view calm video neutral content aid problem affect stillness . Behavioral reinforcement subject payment practice session . Part payment practice session use behavioral reinforcement plan , addition $ 20 payment clinic visit , reimbursement travel 25 mile one-way @ .28/mile , $ 50 MRS visit ( pay regardless success failure ) . The additional subject payment practice session use incentive behavioral reinforcement achieve stillness . Specifically , subject receive token ( poker chip print paper token ) worth $ 5.00 5-minute period remain still . If subject 's head move period , tell begin new period . The achievement stillness determine investigator time , take account actual observe stillness need encourage reward subject ' effort . The actual stillness practice last 40 minute , subject receive token 5 minute period remain still , 8 period . The total additional payment behavioral reinforcement range $ 5.00 $ 40.00 , pay way subject payment . In case adolescent subject , parent encourage consider additional practice session payment go child reward child 's effort . Baseline Visit : Subjects schedule baseline procedure lab result MRS value review approve study physician , case expect period 7 day . This visit consist medical-psychiatric interview neurocognitive testing . A urine pregnancy test ( do previously screen ) may repeat baseline base judgement investigator .</detailed_description>
