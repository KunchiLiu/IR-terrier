	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Patients With Myelofibrosis ( MF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lenalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . Therefore , theory , may decrease prevent growth cancer cell . Prednisone design improve result lenalidomide help reduce side effect . If find eligible take part study , take 1-2 capsule lenalidomide mouth daily . You take lenalidomide daily 21 day follow 1 week rest . This 28-day period call study `` cycle . '' Swallow lenalidomide capsule whole water time day . Do break , chew open capsule . If miss dose lenalidomide , take soon remember day . If miss take dose entire day , take regular dose next schedule day ( NOT take double regular dose make miss dose ) . You take prednisone mouth every day Cycles 1-2 , every day Cycle 3 . You may take prednisone Cycles 1-3 . You give study drug diary . In diary , record take study drug ( ) . During treatment , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn every 1-2 week . Following completion 24 cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn every 1- 3 month . The test may repeat frequently check side effect . Every month first 3 month , every 3 month , complete 24 cycle , study visit . You bone marrow biopsy/aspirate every 3 month . Lenalidomide provide monthly ( 28-day ) supply . Following completion Cycle 24 , study visit every 6 month . You bone marrow biopsy/aspirate every 12 month . Lenalidomide provide monthly ( 28-day ) supply . Depending side effect activity study drug disease , dose study drug may increase decrease . You may stay study long benefitting . You take study longer benefit intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Lenalidomide prednisone FDA approve commercially available . Lenalidomide approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment patient transfusion-dependent anemia due Low- Intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome associate chromosome 5 abnormality without chromosome abnormality . Lenalidomide also approve combination dexamethasone treatment patient multiple myeloma receive least one prior therapy . MDS MM cancer blood . It currently test variety cancer condition . In case consider experimental . Prednisone market many different thing specifically Myelofibrosis . The use drug combination consider investigational study . Up 41 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
