	<brief_title>Comparison Cephalexin Versus Clindamycin Suspected CA-MRSA Skin Infections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Community-associated methicillin resistant Staphylococcus Aureus ( CA-MRSA ) infection increase significantly past decade . Nearly every major region country report infection organism , area report prevalence high 80 % . Epidemiologic evidence point emergence new strain MRSA within community , unique genetic clinical characteristic differentiate traditional hospital-associated MRSA ( HA-MRSA ) . Unlike HA-MRSA , CA-MRSA often susceptible vitro multiple antibiotic class ( penicillin cephalosporin ) , often cause significant , deep-seated abscess healthy individual without know risk factor healthcare contact . Prior awareness disease , many clinician use penicillin cephalosporin antibiotic empiric treatment cutaneous abscess , yet widespread treatment failure face increase CA-MRSA infection NOT occur . During one-year retrospective study pediatric patient institution , find nearly 50 % CA-MRSA abscess treat `` inappropriate '' antibiotic susceptibility profile without significant adverse outcome . Many clinician confront dilemma whether change empiric antibiotic therapy class CA-MRSA would expect susceptible ; common choice include clindamycin , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole ( TMP-SMX ) , vancomycin . Unfortunately , antibiotic problem term increase cost , poor palatability pediatric liquid formulation , poor side effect profile , necessity IV infusion , time optimal , empiric antibiotic treatment presume CA-MRSA skin soft tissue infection unclear . The purpose study help define role antibiotic treatment pediatric skin infection cause CA-MRSA . We hypothesize treatment cephalexin , penicillin-like antibiotic CA-MRSA would expect resistant , result poorer outcome treatment clindamycin , antibiotic CA-MRSA often susceptible .</detailed_description>
