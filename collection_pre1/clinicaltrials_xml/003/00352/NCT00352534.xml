	<brief_summary>This phase III trial study vincristine , dactinomycin , doxorubicin without radiation therapy observation see well work treat patient undergo surgery newly diagnose stage I , stage II , stage III Wilms ' tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , vincristine , dactinomycin , doxorubicin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . Sometimes , surgery , tumor may need additional treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vincristine , Dactinomycin , Doxorubicin With Without Radiation Therapy Observation Only Treating Younger Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery Newly Diagnosed Stage I , Stage II , Stage III Wilms ' Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate overall event-free survival young patient newly diagnose stage I favorable histology Wilms ' tumor ( &lt; 2 year age &lt; 550gms ) treat nephrectomy ( low risk ) , newly diagnose stage III favorable histology Wilms tumor possible nephrectomy follow vincristine , dactinomycin , doxorubicin hydrochloride , radiotherapy ( standard risk ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine effect add doxorubicin hydrochloride regimen patient stage I II favorable histology find high-risk biological marker . II . Determine whether omission adjuvant therapy increase incidence contralateral kidney lesion patient low-risk disease treat nephrectomy observation . III . Determine whether omission adjuvant therapy increase incidence renal failure patient low-risk disease metachronous relapse . IV . Correlate study outcomes patient standard-risk disease biological data tissue collection protocol study COG-AREN03B2 . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord clinical biological risk factor ( low risk v standard risk ) . STRATUM I : ( low-risk disease ) Patients undergo nephrectomy . If meet criterion , observe periodically 5 year . Patients recurrent disease undergo surgery ( immediate delay ) receive chemotherapy stratum III . Patients metachronous renal disease receive radiotherapy . Patients metachronous disease undergo renal-sparing surgery chemotherapy stratum III , radiotherapy . Treatment continue 25 week . STRATUM II : ( standard-risk , stage I II disease adverse biological marker ) Patients undergo nephrectomy . Between 9 14 day post-nephrectomy , patient receive vincristine IV begin day 1 , every week 10 week every 3 week total 15 dos . Patients receive dactinomycin IV begin day 1 , alternate every 3 week doxorubicin hydrochloride IV total 5 dos dactinomycin 4 dos doxorubicin . Treatment continue 25 week . STRATUM III : ( standard-risk , stage III disease ) Patients undergo nephrectomy , feasible , biopsy . For patient undergo biopsy , definitive surgery undertaken week 7 13 . Between 9 14 day post-nephrectomy , patient receive vincristine IV begin day 1 every week 10 week every 3 week total 15 dos . Patients receive dactinomycin IV begin day 1 , alternate every 3 week doxorubicin hydrochloride IV total 5 dos dactinomycin 4 dose doxorubicin hydrochloride . Patients undergo radiotherapy 5-7 day nephrectomy . Treatment continue 25 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 8 year .</detailed_description>
