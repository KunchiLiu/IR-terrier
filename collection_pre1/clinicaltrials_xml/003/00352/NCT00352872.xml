	<brief_summary>The goal pilot study delineate role genetic variation premature menopause , hot flash , toxicity cohort premenopausal woman early breast cancer . Primary Objective- To ascertain effect common variant allele CYP450 2B6 , 2C19 , 2C9 , 3A5 pre-menopausal woman breast cancer receive anthracycline cyclophosphamide base chemotherapy relate occurrence premature menopause ( defined 12 month amenorrhea serum estradiol FSH level consistent post-menopausal status ) Secondary Objective # 1- To obtain pilot data effect common variant allele CYP450 2B6 , 2C19 , 2C9 , 3A5 pre-menopausal woman breast cancer receive anthracycline cyclophosphamide base chemotherapy relate occurrence hot flash frequency , common toxicity therapy require dose delay reduction . Secondary Objective # 2- To obtain pilot data correlation hot flash serum level serotonin , tryptophan , metabolites polymorphism serotonin transporter receptor gene .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There clear survival benefit use adjuvant cytotoxic therapy woman invasive breast cancer , even hormone receptor positive disease receive adjuvant hormonal therapy tamoxifen.1 In addition , several trial show benefit anthracycline base regimen classic combination cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , 5-fluorouracil.1-4 The improved efficacy taxanes adjuvant set recently demonstrate patient lymph-node positive disease.5-8 Despite clear survival benefit cytotoxic therapy , 10 year-disease specific mortality remain suboptimal 69-78 % 49-53 % patient without lymph node involvement , respectively.9 Of 180,000 woman diagnose breast cancer United States , one-fourth pre-menopausal.10-13 Breast cancer clearly represent one commonly diagnose malignancy patient population . With common use adjuvant chemotherapy , long-term sequela treatment become increasingly important . In addition acute toxicity anthracycline cyclophosphamide-based regimens,5 one side effect psycho-social physical implication pre-mature menopause.13-17 The frequency menopause induce poly-agent chemotherapy range 34-89 % .16,18,19 Multiple factor ( patient drug-related ) play role explain large variability . The age patient ( time therapy ) ,13,19,20 type chemotherapy drugs,18,21 duration intensity22 therapy influence overall likelihood patient prematurely enter menopause therapy . In previously report study , age systemic therapy important variable determine menopause woman loco-regional breast cancer multivariate analysis.19 Women advance age high rate menopause expect . Hormonal therapy , much great degree , systemic therapy predict early menopause . The combination systemic hormonal therapy appear additive effect induction menopause . Of importance , however , add impact hormonal therapy ( added cytotoxic therapy ) appear play minimal role induction menopause compare cytotoxic therapy alone . It also likely intrinsic host genetic variability may also play role well . The variable ability metabolize clear drug may , part , affect efficacy toxicity drug may ultimately impact effect drug ovarian function . One important example relate polymorphism enzymes important clearance describe drug . To date , little work do understand importance inter-individual , host specific variability risk breast cancer patient experience drug-induced , pre-mature menopause .</detailed_description>
