	<brief_summary>The `` Agricultural Health Study '' ( AHS ) collaborative effort National Cancer Institute National Institute Environmental Health Sciences . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency National Institute Occupational Safety Health provide support limit exposure assessment effort . Initial data collection prospective cohort 89,658 study subject complete December 1997 . Participants complete questionnaire include item pesticide use , agricultural exposure , work practice modify exposure well activity may affect either exposure disease risk ( e.g. , diet , exercise , alcohol consumption , medical condition , family history cancer , occupation smoke history ) . Phase II study ( 1998-2003 ) update information occupational exposure , diet , work practice medical history mean computer assist telephone interview . We also collect buccal cell sample 34,000 study participant assess effect inheritable polymorphisms interaction environment genomic predisposition . The stimulus prospective investigation come grow evidence , despite low mortality overall , farmer experience excess several cancer . These excess observe retrospective epidemiological study among agricultural worker several country . Excess cancer observe lymphatic hematopoietic system , connective tissue , skin , brain , prostate , stomach lip . Several tumor ( brain , NHL , multiple myeloma , prostate ) also increase general population many country . This suggest common set exposure may explain high rate farmer rise rate general population . Farmers , family , pest control worker may contact variety potentially hazardous substance include pesticide , solvent , fuel oil , engine exhaust , dust zoonotic virus microbe . Our cohort study include registered pesticide applicator Iowa North Carolina spouse applicator farmer . The health effect pesticide use primary focus study . The influence farm exposure also evaluate . The focus phase II follow-up period ( 2004-2008 ) update exposure information health history mean computer assist interview also follow cohort determine disease incidence mortality . The cohort follow cancer registry within Iowa North Carolina , Social Security Administration database , state vital statistic office , National Death Index , various in-state database , list register pesticide applicator . Individuals enrol study longer address give enrollment ( base subsequent attempt follow ) submit continue submit ( NIOSH ) standard format IRS Project 057 Taxpayer Address Request Program . Identifying data provide IRS include SSN first four letter last name cohort member . IRS provide return current address IRS record match ( SSN + four letter last name ) find . The purpose effort identify member cohort move state , enable adjustment person-years incidence mortality calculation . Persons move state follow vital status cause death , cancer incidence . Continuation protocol provide valuable epidemiologic resource help prevent cancer future identify risk factor rural/agricultural environment . Because case important cancer outcome occur cohort every year , potential cancer cause evaluate increase statistical power . Larger number case also allow statistical control confound factor , make meaningful conclusion cancer risk , , relatively infrequent cancer , lyphomas leukemia , great follow-up time necessary make meaningful observation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The `` Agricultural Health Study '' ( AHS ) collaborative effort National Cancer Institute National Institute Environmental Health Sciences . The US Environmental Protection Agency National Institute Occupational Safety Health provide support limit exposure assessment effort . Initial data collection prospective cohort 89,656 study subject complete December 1997 ( Phase I ) . Participants complete questionnaire include item pesticide use , agricultural exposure , work practice modify exposure well activity may affect either exposure disease risk ( e.g. , diet , exercise , alcohol consumption , medical condition , family history cancer , occupation smoke history ) . Phase II study ( 1998-2003 ) update information occupational exposure , diet , work practice medical history mean computer assist telephone interview . We also collect buccal cell sample 35,164 study participant assess effect inheritable polymorphisms interaction environment genomic predisposition . The stimulus prospective investigation come grow evidence , despite low mortality overall , farmer experience excess several cancer . These excess observe retrospective epidemiological study among agricultural worker several country . Excess cancer observe lymphatic hematopoietic system , connective tissue , skin , brain , prostate , stomach lip . Several tumor ( e.g. , brain , NHL , multiple myeloma , prostate ) also increase general population many country . This suggest common set exposure may explain high rate farmer rise rate general population . Farmers , family , pest control worker may contact variety potentially hazardous substance include pesticide , solvent , fuel oil , engine exhaust , dust zoonotic virus microbe . Our cohort study include registered pesticide applicator Iowa North Carolina spouse applicator farmer . The health effect pesticide use primary focus study . The influence farm exposure also evaluate . Phase III data collection activity complete February 2010 . The focus phase III follow-up period ( 2004- 2010 ) update exposure information health history mean computer assist interview , follow cohort determine disease incidence mortality , collect buccal cell sample newly-developing cancer case ( matched control ) previously donate sample . Phase III follow-up interview complete 44,130 participant ; specifically , interview complete 24,171 applicator 19,959 spouse . Additionally , 1,245 buccal sample collect Phase III among select participant incident cancer . No adverse event report Phase III . The cohort continue follow cancer registry within Iowa North Carolina , Social Security Administration database , state vital statistic office , National Death Index , various in-state database , list register pesticide applicator . Individuals enrol study longer address give enrollment ( base subsequent attempt followup ) submit continue submit ( NIOSH ) standard format IRS Project 057 Taxpayer Address Request Program . Identifying data provide IRS include SSN first four letter last name cohort member . IRS provide return current address IRS record match ( SSN + four letter last name ) find . The purpose effort identify member cohort move state , enable adjustment person-years incidence mortality calculation . Persons move state follow vital status cause death , cancer incidence . Additionally , Iowa field station maintain database AHS cohort child Iowa establish linkage cohort Iowa birth certificate . This composite child identify Iowa cohort data birth certificate 2008 ( 35,000 live birth ) , link Iowa driver license tape , Iowa cancer incidence database , Iowa mortality database , NDI , Internal Revenue Service ( obtain updated address ) . As adult linkage , data hold AHS coordinate center available secondary analysis . Continuation protocol provide valuable epidemiologic resource help prevent cancer future identify risk factor rural/agricultural environment . Because case important cancer outcome occur cohort every year , potential cancer cause evaluate increase statistical power . Larger number case also allow statistical control confound factor meaningful conclusion cancer risk , , relatively infrequent cancer , lyphomas leukemia , great follow-up time necessary make meaninful observation . The process planning Phase IV begin expect begin close FY2011 .</detailed_description>
