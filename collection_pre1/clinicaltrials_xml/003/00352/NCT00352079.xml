	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , BCG , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Gefitinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving BCG together gefitinib may kill tumor cell . It yet know whether BCG effective without gefitinib treat bladder cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study BCG gefitinib see well work compare BCG alone treat patient high-risk bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BCG With Without Gefitinib Treating Patients With High-Risk Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare impact gefitinib intravesical BCG v intravesical BCG alone time treatment failure patient high-risk , superficial transitional cell carcinoma bladder . Secondary - Compare complete response rate patient carcinoma situ receive gefitinib intravesical BCG v patient receive intravesical BCG alone . - Compare time recurrence patient treat regimen . - Compare time progression patient treat regimen . - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Characterize contrast adverse event safety profile regimens patient . - Compare effect regimens quality life patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , prospective , open-label , control , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord study center , status tumor ( primary v recurrent ) , carcinoma situ ( yes v ) , prior BCG therapy ( yes v ) , single dose intravesical mitomycin C time recent transurethral resection ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive induction therapy comprise intravesical BCG weekly 6 week . Patients receive maintenance therapy comprise intravesical BCG weekly 3 week . - Arm II : Patients receive induction therapy comprise intravesical BCG weekly 6 week oral gefitinib daily 12 week . Patients receive maintenance therapy comprise intravesical BCG weekly 3 week oral gefitinib daily 12 week . In arm , treatment maintenance therapy repeat 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 month total 7 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , periodically study therapy , 3 6 month completion study therapy . After study completion , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 4 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 166 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
