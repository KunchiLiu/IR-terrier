	<brief_summary>Timely diagnosis intraepithelial neoplasia ( premalignant condition ) crucial importance clinical management ulcerative colitis . We assess value combine chromoscopy endomicroscopy diagnosis intraepithelial neoplasia randomise control trial . Endomicroscopy new device enables microscopy mucosal layer ongoing colonoscopy . Chromoscopy mean topical stain mucosal surface unmask area interest , subsequently examine endomicroscopic system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) immune cell-mediated inflammatory bowel disease characterize mucosal ulceration , rectal bleeding , diarrhea , abdominal pain . Patients long stand UC face increase risk development colitis associate colorectal cancer . Factors associate increased risk cancer development include duration disease , extensive colonic involvement ( pancolitis , backwash ileitis ) , primary sclerosing cholangitis severe chronic active inflammation . Based observation , colonoscopic surveillance patient long-standing UC highly recommend . The main objective surveillance colonoscopy UC detect neoplasia surgically curative preferably pre-invasive stage . However , contrast sporadic colorectal cancer , grow pattern neoplastic tissue UC often flat multifocal . Therefore , significant lesion conventional colonoscopy UC frequently overlook . Chromoscopy topically apply dye methylene blue indigo carmine facilitate endoscopic detection flat , circumscribed colitis associate neoplastic change UC . In fact , five control study show diagnostic yield detection intraepithelial neoplasia ( IN ) use chromoscopy high compare conventional colonoscopy random biopsy . Based study , chromoscopy recently consider incorporation US guideline surveillance patient long-standing UC . However , although technique allow identification mucosal lesion , suitable accurate endoscopic diagnosis intraepithelial neoplasias UC due lack cellular resolution subsurface imaging . For endoscopy , novel technique allow accurate diagnosis ongoing examination highly desirable may allow appropriate immediate therapeutic manoeuvre ( e.g . resection versus biopsy ) . Recently , miniaturize confocal microscope develop integrated distal tip conventional colonoscope . This new diagnostic technology gastrointestinal endoscopy , denote confocal endomicroscopy , enable histological evaluation mucosal layer ongoing colonoscopy . Furthermore , patient screen sporadic colorectal cancer , surface subsurface analysis cellular subcellular resolution use predict intraepithelial neoplasia ( INs ) high accuracy . However , due time require examination large surface area , technique suitable screen entire colonic surface UC detect neoplasias flat mucosa . In present study , employ chromoscopy identify potential neoplastic lesion combine first time endomicroscopy endoscopic diagnosis colitis associate intraepithelial neoplasias UC . Using chromoscopy guide endomicroscopy ecaluate whether diagnostic yield diagnose IN significantly increase .</detailed_description>
