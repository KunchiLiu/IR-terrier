	<brief_summary>This study examine incidence cardiac complication , particularly cardiomyopathy , patient undergone allogeneic ( donor ) stem cell transplantation NIH . Cardiac complication patient well document . Most commonly , patient develop congestive heart failure pericarditis receive high-dose cyclophosphamide , radiation , intensive chemotherapy regimens prior transplant . Most data medical literature suggest rate serious cardiac complication relatively low , 5 percent less . Recently , cluster case significant cardiomyopathy stem cell transplant patient NIH Clinical Center prompt concern incidence complication higher report medical literature . This study define incidence cardiac problem , primarily focus cardiomyopathy , follow objective : - To define incidence cardiomyopathy allogeneic stem cell transplant patient enrol National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) National Heart , Lung , Blood ( NHLBI ) protocols NIH Clinical Center - To document presence absence various know suspected risk factor cardiomyopathy document case . The study consist chart review patient allogeneic stem cell transplant either NHLBI NCI protocol since 1999 . This project first step clarify cardiac complication follow stem cell transplantation , incidence , characteristic patient population . It look patient demographic , characteristic cardiac complication , know suspected risk factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiomyopathy Following Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac complication patient undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) well document . Most commonly patient present congestive heart failure and/or pericarditis receive high-dose cyclophosphamide , total body irradiation ( TBI ) intensive condition / preparative regimen prior allogeneic transplant . The majority data medical literature suggest rate serious cardiac event appear relatively low approximately 5 % less . Recently , appear cluster patient case ( approximately 15 ) significant cardiomyopathy patient receive allogeneic HSCT NIH Clinical Center past year . These case consult Cardiology consult service include NCI NHLBI protocol patient . This cluster case prompt concern incidence cardiac toxicity recently see NIH Clinical Center consistent report incidence significant cardiac toxicity medical literature . The propose retrospective chart review intend define incidence cardiac toxicity , primarily focus cardiomyopathy . The project initial step consolidate data NCI NHLBI transplant program clarify document cardiac toxicity , incidence , demographic patient population . We also plan document presence absence variety know suspected risk factor cardiotoxicity . This analysis preliminary potentially lead formal prospective study cardiotoxicity relate allogeneic HSCT .</detailed_description>
