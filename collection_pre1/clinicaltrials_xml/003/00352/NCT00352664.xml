	<detailed_description>Donepezil currently use treatment certain type mental disorder , include Alzheimer 's disease . Recent research study show donepezil help improve drowsiness cancer patient receive opioid medication . Before treatment start , ask answer question regard cancer diagnosis , medication taking , symptom ( i.e . pain , fatigue , nausea , depression , anxiety , drowsiness , shortness breath , appetite , sleep problem , constipation , well-being ) test cognitive status ( match specific number give geometric figure ) perform . It take 30 minute complete evaluation . Women risk pregnant must negative urine pregnancy test . If qualify enter study randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two group . Participants one group receive donepezil one week . Participants group receive placebo ( tablet contain medication look like donepezil pill ) . You equal chance ( 50/50 ) place either group . Neither medical staff researcher study know receive study drug placebo . You take 1 tablet donepezil/placebo day 7 day . The research nurse contact phone ( person hospital ) daily ask question side effect symptom . On Day 8 , need come palliative care clinic evaluation . If come clinic day 8 , evaluation perform telephone . Evaluation sedation/drowsiness , pain , constipation , fatigue , side effect , effectiveness treatment , test nervous system cognitive status perform . If develop intolerable side effect study , medication stop remove study . After evaluation Day 8 , participant offer chance receive 1 tablet donepezil every day 7 day . The research nurse follow phone ( person hospital ) 3 4 day receive donepezil ( open label ) ask question side effect symptom . On Day 15 , need come palliative care clinic evaluation . Evaluation sedation/drowsiness , pain , constipation , fatigue , side effect , effectiveness treatment , test nervous system cognitive status perform . You give option continue additional 8 week . During 8 week , follow conduct primary physician . This investigational study . Donepezil approve FDA commercially available drug . Its use study investigational . It continue prescribed primary physician time need . A total 100 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient drowsiness/sedation cause opiate &gt; 3 day intensity equal 3/10 ( 0 10 scale ; 0 = sedation , 10=worst possible sedation ) . 2 . Patient receive regular dose strong opioid treatment cancer pain , dose change dose change within 50 % least 48 hours.Regular administration , define short act opioids oral parenteral every 4 hour around clock , slow release oral opioids every 12 h 24 h , transdermal opioids every 72 hour . Strong opioids include morphine , hydromorphone , methadone , fentanyl , oxycodone . 3 . Patient relatively intact cognition define Mini Mental State Examination accord age educational level . A score 24 usually consider normal . 4 . Patient willing engage follow visit nurse phone day 27 ( day ) , 11 15 study return follow visit day 8 treatment . If patient unable come clinic , assessment perform telephone . 5 . Sexually active female risk pregnant negative urine pregnancy test 6 . Written consent form sign . 7 . Patients 18 year old 8 . Concurrent radiation treatment ( define 10 less fraction palliative indication ) allow 9 . Concurrent chemotherapy allow , first two cycle well tolerate ( define grade 3 4 nonhematological toxicity ) 1 . Major contraindication donepezil i.e . hypersensitivity donepezil piperidine derivative . 2 . Patients major change opiate dose , analgesia requirement , anesthetic procedure general anesthetic expect next seven day . 3 . Treatment anticholinergic agent ( i.e. , glycopyrrolate ) 4 . Patients take Methylphenidate . 5 . Patients tube feed ( due difficulty accurate assess symptom appetite anorexia ) . 6 . History ongoing arrhythmia cause rhythm sinus rhythm</criteria>
