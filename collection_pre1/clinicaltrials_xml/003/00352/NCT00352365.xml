	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Treating Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Test whether complete response rate among old patient previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) del ( 5q ) cytogenetic abnormality treat lenalidomide sufficiently high warrant phase III investigation . II . Estimate frequency severity toxicity drug patient . III . Correlate , preliminary manner , additional cytogenetic abnormality response lenalidomide . IV . Estimate total ( complete partial ) response rate cytogenetic response rate patient . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-14 , 1-21 , 1-28 ( course 1 ) . Patients undergo bone marrow biopsy day 28 35 ass treatment efficacy . Patients stable improve disease ( i.e. , decrease blast percentage ) without progressive disease proceed maintenance therapy . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Beginning within 42 day completion induction therapy , patient receive oral lenalidomide daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
