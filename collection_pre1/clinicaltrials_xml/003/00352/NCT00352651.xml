	<brief_title>Study Find Out Therapy With Drug Pregabalin Relieves Pain During Shingles Compared With Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) small double-stranded DNA herpes virus , one capable produce two different disease , varicella ( chickenpox ) herpes zoster ( acute herpes zoster [ AHZ ] , shingle ) . The incidence AHZ , secondary VZV infection , strongly age-dependent reach 1 % per year age 80 300,000 1 million new case AHZ year US . AHZ almost always painful , pain disable severity , render sufferer bed-bound incapacitated carry normal activity , lead weight loss dehydration sufficient require inpatient therapy . The elderly especially likely suffer severe pain . The common complication AHZ development postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) . Although overall incidence PHN AHZ 10 % , incidence report rise high 80 % age 80 . In published study , age great severity initial zoster pain find significantly increase risk develop PHN . Severe zoster pain believe correlate severe cutaneous outbreak , severe inflammation nerve trunk , possibly great injury primary afferent nerve fiber . There two separate issue address discuss pain AHZ . The first managing AHZ pain , burden suffering high . The second reducing incidence PHN . Both issue need consider trial design , part severe AHZ pain risk factor PHN . Studies analgesic effect pregabalin suggest analgesic profile similar gabapentin . We would therefore predict , pregabalin would reduce pain associate AHZ possibly prevent development PHN .</detailed_description>
