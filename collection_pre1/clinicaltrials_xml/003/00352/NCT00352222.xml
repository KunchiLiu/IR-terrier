	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Express LD Treat Stenosed Occlusive Atherosclerotic Disease Iliac Arteries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct provide additional data safety efficacy Express™ Vascular LD stent , particularly regard long-term patency iliac artery . The study would provide data angiographic endpoint clinical outcome 30 day , 6 month , 12 24 month post implantation atherosclerotic lesion iliac artery . The data obtain study use Express™ Vascular LD stent compare historical data obtain use Palmaz balloon-expandable stent . The Palmaz balloon expandable stent choose control device currently FDA-approved balloon-expandable stent use percutaneous treatment atherosclerotic disease iliac artery . The Palmaz balloon-expandable stent longer commercialize Europe . Therefore randomize study Palmaz balloon-expandable stent feasible . In addition , ongoing publish randomized trial describe performance new version Palmaz stent iliac atherosclerotic lesion . In order adequately compare efficacy data ExpressTM Vascular LD stent efficacy data Palmaz balloon-expandable stent , efficacy parameter publication Palmaz balloon-expandable stent measure study : % mean loss luminal diameter 6 month post-procedure . The findings longer-term Follow-Up assessment 12 24 month present result assessment become available .</detailed_description>
