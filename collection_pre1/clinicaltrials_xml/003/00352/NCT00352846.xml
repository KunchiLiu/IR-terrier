	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - Evaluate effect zoledronate change bone mineral density ( BMD ) total lumbar spine femoral neck . Secondary Objectives : - Evaluate effect zoledronate change BMD total hip - Evaluate risk factor develop osteoporosis chemotherapy - Determine correlative marker response zoledronate 4 . Evaluate zoledronate effect new bone fracture 5 . Evaluate cost-effectiveness zoledronic acid ( calcium vitamin D ) versus standard treatment ( calcium vitamin D alone ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Zoledronic Acid Chemotherapy Induced Bone Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Medicines call `` bisphosphonates '' show help people cancer spread bone . Zoledronic acid `` bisphosphonate '' . Some bisphosphonates pill swallow . Other bisphosphonates zoledronic acid need give vein ( intravenously ) . Some study show people multiple myeloma , breast cancer , prostate cancer spread bone less side effect bone disease treat bisphosphonates vein . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one two treatment group . Participants one group receive standard care calcium Vitamin D alone . Participants group receive standard care calcium Vitamin D plus zoledronic acid . There equal chance assign either group . Both study doctor know treat zoledronic acid . You ask come doctor 's clinic 5 time 12 month ( start study [ baseline ] every 3 month ) . Each visit take 1 hour . Participants zoledronic acid group receive infusion zoledronic acid vein baseline 6 month study . The infusion last 30 minute . This infusion procedure may may do time already schedule chemotherapy treatment . You take calcium Vitamin D pill study amount recommend prevention osteoporosis . You physical exam do every visit . Various x-rays and/or bone density scan repeat 12 month . Your doctor may also want additional bone density x-ray scan new symptom symptom get bad . Before treatment , blood test ( 1-2 teaspoon blood ) make sure kidney okay treatment zoledronic acid . At visit . doctor nurse ask feel ask medication take medical problem since last visit . You ask complete questionnaire feel certain visit . These questionnaire 1 page long take minute complete . It anticipate participation study 12 month . If cancer get bad , doctor feel treat different medicine , take study doctor talk medicine may better . Participants receive Zoledronic Acid contact regularly ask experience osteonecrosis ( bone death ) , 10 year time enroll study . They interview telephone call every 6 month . This investigational study . Zoledronic acid approve FDA treatment high calcium level blood . Zoledronic acid approve FDA use study . After treatment end , may continue receive zoledronic acid similar drug , cancer doctor feel would help . About 72 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
