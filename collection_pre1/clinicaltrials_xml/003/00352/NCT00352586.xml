	<brief_summary>This study evaluate whether drug D-cycloserine ( DCS ) improve type learning call classical conditioning , brain learns associate neutral stimulus stimuli elicit emotional physiological response . DCS antibiotic initially approve treat tuberculosis test clinical trial last decade enhance cognitive function . This protocol include pilot study main study . The main study begin pilot study end . Healthy normal volunteer 18 45 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical psychiatric history physical examination include blood urine sample , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , hear test startle test . The startle test involve record eyeblink response loud noise . After screen visit , enrol participate pilot main study , reaction two type stimuli-an unpleasant , harmless , shock arm mild puff air eye-will measure record . - Pilot Study Session 1 - Participants receive brief electric shock deliver two electrode attach forearm finger hear brief loud sound may startle . Geometric shape present computer monitor . Sessions 2 3 - The procedure session 1 , except participant also subject brief low-intensity tone airpuffs eye . - Main Study Participants undergo procedure describe pilot study , follow addition : - They intravenous tube place vein collect blood test . - They take pill test day contain either 100 mg DCS , 500 mg DCS , placebo ( inactive substance ) . Subjects assign receive DCS get active drug one three test session give placebo two session . The placebo group receive placebo three session . In pilot main study , subject ' physiological response stimuli record . Electrodes place two finger ( measure sweat , electrodermal activity ) , ribcage midway waist armpit ( measure heart rate ) , one eye ( measure eye blink ) . Pulse record device attach finger , breathe rate record special belt place around chest . At various time session , subject fill questionnaires experience . Participants may withdraw study point .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect D-cycloserine Extinction Fear Conditioning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol examine effect two drug fear conditioning . Study 1 test assess whether D-cycloserine ( DCS ) facilitate extinction fear condition acquisition eyeblink conditioning . Study 2 examines whether calcium channel blocker nimodipine block acquisition fear condition eyeblink conditioning . Study 1 : The demonstration activation NMDA receptor necessary long-term potentiation suggest subclass amino acid may involve certain type learn memory . The present project examine effect DCS , partial agonist glycine modulatory site NMDA receptor , two associative learn task , extinction fear condition acquisition eyeblink conditioning . The inability extinguish intense fear memory significant clinical problem . Finding procedure treatment facilitate extinction fear memory paramount importance . In animal , extinction condition fear involves active learn process block NMDA antagonist . Recently , Dr. Michael Davis ( Emory University ) demonstrate administration DCS prior extinction produce dose-dependent facilitation extinction condition fear rat , assess fear-potentiated startle . We propose examine whether clinically important process extinction also enhance DCS human . Another aim study examine whether DCS facilitate hippocampal-mediated task , trace eyeblink conditioning . The hippocampus particularly rich NMDA receptor DCS block trace eyeblink condition rabbit . The present study examine effect placebo , 100 mg DCS , 500 mg DCS extinction , retention , reinstatement fear-potentiated startle conditioning acquisition trace eyeblink conditioning . The first experimental session ( acquisition ) fear conditioning procedure ( paired presentation condition stimulus CS mildly unpleasant shock ) . During second experimental session ( extinction ) , DCS placebo give subject 1 hour prior extinction procedure ( CS present without shock ) . Following extinction , eyeblink condition study conduct . Finally , third experimental session , retention fear eyeblink conditioning evaluate . We hypothesize compare placebo , DCS speed learning , i.e. , facilitate extinction fear condition acquisition eyeblink conditioning . Study 2 : The rationale test nimodipine highly similar rationale test DCS , procedure similar . Understanding neurochemical base fear acquisition fear extinction may provide insight pathological anxiety help develop effective treatment . This study conduct two experimental session ( screen session ) . Nimodipine placebo give 1st session prior acquisition fear condition eyeblink conditioning . The 2nd session test retention eyeblink condition . We hypothesize nimodipine impair fear condition eyeblink conditioning .</detailed_description>
