	<brief_title>Sildenafil Increase Exercise Capacity Individuals With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IPF disease damage air sacs lung lead widespread permanent scar lung tissue . Individuals IPF may experience breathe difficulty , cough , chest pain , decrease exercise capacity . There cure disease , individual usually die within 3 5 year . It recommend individual IPF engage moderate exercise , help maintain strength improve lung function . Many individual IPF also suffer pulmonary hypertension , high blood pressure artery lead lung . Sildenafil , medication currently use treat pulmonary hypertension , increase blood flow lung enhance gas exchange within lung . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness sildenafil improve exercise tolerance breathe difficulty individual IPF pulmonary hypertension . This 3-week study enroll individual IPF pulmonary hypertension . Study visit occur baseline , Weeks 1 2 . At baseline visit , participant perform 6-minute walk test , measure distance walk 6-minute period . Oxygen level measure prior test , standardize questionnaire complete assess breathing difficulty . A second 6-minute walk test perform 1 hour follow first test . At Week 1 visit , participant randomly assign receive single dose either 50 mg sildenafil placebo . One hour receive medication , complete another 6-minute walk test . The Week 2 visit identical Week 1 visit , except participant receive sildenafil Week 1 receive placebo Week 2 , vice versa .</detailed_description>
