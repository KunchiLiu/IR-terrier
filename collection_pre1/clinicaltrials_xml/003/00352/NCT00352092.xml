	<brief_title>Pilot Study HLA Identical Living Donor Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness steroid-free calcineurin-inhibitor free treatment regimen patient receive kidney transplant live donor HLA - identical , word , similar immune system . The immune system defense system body use fight foreign substance enter body , transplant kidney . Two people similar immune system less likely fight reject organ donated one . HLA-identical kidney transplant recipient less likely need large amount immunosuppression immunologically similar . In study , treat immunosuppressive medication , Cellcept , Rapamune , Prograf rejection free period remain Cellcept alone . This treatment regimen currently use The University Cincinnati HLA-identical live donor kidney transplant recipient . This study conduct determine protocol currently use result beneficial outcomes HLA-identical kidney transplant recipient . Only recently transplant center consider avoid steroid therapy ( prednisone ) transplant patient steroid use successfully long , many side effect . The ability stop steroid occur due availability newer effective immunosuppressive medication . Stopping steroid try patient consider low high risk kidney rejection . Patients consider risk rejection may typically leave steroid forever attempt stop steroid would make patient one year transplant already receive lot steroid therapy result side effect . This study conduct patient low risk rejection potentially benefit steroid avoidance . Overall , concept steroid avoidance patient low risk rejection much acceptable newer , potent medication recently become available prevent acute rejection . These new medication include Prograf ( tacrolimus ) , Cellcept ( mycophenolate mofetil ) , Rapamune ( sirolimus ) . Currently , kidney transplant recipient receive medication consist tacrolimus cyclosporine , mycophenolate mofetil azathioprine , steroid . However , recently , combination Prograf ( tacrolimus ) Rapamune ( sirolimus ) steroid withdrawal 3 month transplantation study patient receive liver , liver/kidney , kidney/pancreas transplant . This study show low rate acute rejection excellent patient kidney survival . The addition Cellcept Prograf Rapamune think safe effective alternative use steroid transplant patient . Due low risk rejection HLA-identical kidney transplant recipient , patient study slowly withdraw Rapamune Prograf rejection free period time . Withdrawal medication avoidance steroid could decrease development high blood pressure , high cholesterol , diabetes , tremor , infection transplant . This study determine medication regimen safe , effective , able produce beneficial post transplant outcome .</detailed_description>
