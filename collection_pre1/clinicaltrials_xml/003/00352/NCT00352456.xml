	<brief_summary>This study direct toward good understanding brain regulate emotion social antisocial behavior . It look use orbital frontal cortex amygdala brain . Brain change involve solve conflict feeling conflict produce . Conflicts may occur people general social rule . The researcher ' expectation finding useful develop therapy may improve people 's ability solve social conflict reduce antisocial behavior . Adults age 20 50 year age psychopathy second set comparison adult , release Fairfax County Adult Detention Center , may eligible study . The neurocognitive component study , one pertaining performance various task , involve 20 adult psychopathy 20 comparison adult . The neuroimaging component , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan use , involve 18 adult 18 comparison adult . Two visit participant entail . At first visit , patient undergo follow procedure test : - Physical examination - Test vital sign , lie stand . - Electrocardiogram . - Collection blood chemistry hematology . - Urinalysis liver function test . - Screen HIV hepatitis . - Pregnancy test , applicable , first visit visit . Depending group assign , second visit , patient undergo MRI scan take part variety computer-based task measure different form think skill , emotional response , decision making . During MRI scan , patient lie still table slide enclose tunnel MRI scanner . They ask lie still possible . As scanner take picture , patient hear knock beep sound , wear earplugs reduce noise . Patients able communicate MRI staff time scan , may ask move machine time . While lie MRI scanner , patient ask perform task present via screen . These task involve look picture word , patient ask make decision picture . The MRI scan take 2 hour . In regard computer-based task participant perform , task often game present computer . Via computer , paper , may presentations picture bring emotion . There direct treatment therapeutic benefit participation study . However , knowledge gain may help people future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Psychopathy Checklist-Revised ( Hare , 1991 ) allow identification relatively homogeneous population individual present mark emotional dysfunction ( reduce empathy , guilt attachment others ) well notable propensity goal-directed antisocial behavior . Identification neuro-biological underpinnings emotional dysfunction crucial importance level emotion dysfunction important predictor long term prognosis . Currently , two main position regard neural system dysfunctional individual psychopathy : First , pathology associate amygdala dysfunction ; Secondly , pathology associate orbital frontal cortex dysfunction . A third , recent position , stress interconnection two system role development may play disorder . The current project determine performance individual psychopathy comparison individual measure recruit amygdala orbital frontal cortex . In addition , series functional neuro-imaging study directly assess neural response two system individual psychopathy . Finally , structural imaging study examine anatomical difference group . The project provide clear data constrain future theorize pathology implicate disorder .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Psychopathy : 1 . Comparison individual : All individual score less 20 PCLR . 2 . Individuals psychopathy : All individual score 30 PCLR ( participant score 2129 exclude study participation ) . 2 . Age : Participants male female , 2050 year age . 3 . IQ : IQ , measure 4 subscales Wechsler Adult Intelligence ScaleRevised ( WAISR ) , must great 80 . 4 . Medication status : No current use psychotropic medication benzodiazepine . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Because factor psychiatric disease , CNS disease , influence functional brain activity , factor exclusionary . 1 . Psychiatric history : Participants assess use DSMIV criterion via standardized psychiatric interview conduct trained examiner ( i.e. , SCID ) . 1 . Comparison individual : All participant free current past psychiatric disorder . Participants exclude meet criterion substance dependence meet criterion substance abuse . 2 . Individuals psychopathy : It expect individual psychopathy meet diagnostic criterion Antisocial Personality Disorder , childhood , would meet criterion Conduct Disorder , Oppositional Defiant Disorder probably Attentional Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . Any current past psychiatric disorder exclusory . Participants exclude meet criterion substance dependence meet criterion substance abuse . 2 . Severe acute chronic medical illness . In short , condition require administration systemic drug exclusory . 3 . CNS disease : history brain abnormality ( e.g. , neoplasms , subarachnoid cyst ) , cerebrovascular disease , infectious disease ( e.g. , abscess ) , neurological disease , history head trauma ( defined loss consciousness great 3 min ) . 4 . Metal electronic object : Metal plate , certain type dental brace , cardiac pacemaker , etc. , sensitive electromagnetic field contraindicate MRI scan . 5 . Claustrophobia : participant question potential discomfort enclose space , MRI scanner . 6 . There exclusion criterion regard type crime . While increase risk tester participant committed act violence , extreme long participant appropriately treat . Indeed , previous work almost participant ( comparison individual individual psychopathy ) murderer .</criteria>
