	<brief_summary>The goal research study look long individual treat early stage NSCLC HNSCC live without develop lung cancer . Another goal develop tool help predict likelihood lung cancer occurrence population . This do study characteristic tissue bodily fluid ( include blood ) . Objectives : - To assess smoking-related disease-free survival patient current former smoker prior definitively-treated stage I/II lung head neck cancer . - To develop risk model help predict likelihood lung cancer development image biomarker base high-risk population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vanguard Study Head Neck Cancer Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study know Vanguard Trial . When enter study , complete medical history ( include smoke history ) physical exam , include measurement height , weight , vital sign ( include blood pressure , heart rate , temperature ) . You performance status evaluation ( test look ability perform every day activity ) . You blood sample draw routine blood test ( 3 teaspoon ) , check blood clot function ( 1-2 teaspoon ) , research purpose ( 4 teaspoon ) . You chest x-ray CT scan chest . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . If currently smoker , give information program help quit smoking . Although encouraged quit smoking , quit smoking participate program part study . You also bronchoscopy ( tissue sample lung ) begin study lab analysis . For procedure , give drug relax . Then , local anesthetic spray nose throat numb area . A slim , flexible tube light place nose mouth lung . Tweezers feed tube collect lung tissue ( biopsy ) sample 6 different place lung . During bronchoscopy procedure , complete inspection airway perform . Any suspicious area see white-light autofluorescence bronchoscopy identify biopsy brushing perform evaluate whether pre-cancerous tissue present . You also bronchial brush next biopsy site . In bronchial brushing , small brush feed tube lung sample lung tissue gently scrap . When biopsy brush do , bronchial lavage ( bronchial washing ) . In bronchial lavage , small amount water ( 4 tablespoon ) spray lung suction tube . This fluid use collect additional tissue mucous sample . In addition , sputum ( saliva ) sample take inside cheek scrap ( buccal sample ) . If HNSCC , also laryngoscopy . In laryngoscopy , light tube place throat larynx check . The back throat spray anesthetic procedure make procedure comfortable . While study , return clinic least 3 year total 6 year . At Months 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , complete medical history record , physical exam either doctor nurse . At visit , also blood drawn routine test ( 3 teaspoon ) research purpose ( 4 teaspoon ) . You also chest x-ray chest CT visit . At Months 12 , 24 36 , blood drawn ( 1-2 teaspoon ) check blood-clotting function . If think may pregnant , also urine blood pregnancy test . In addition , bronchoscopy provide sputum buccal smear sample 12 month visit . If treat HNSCC laryngoscopy 12 month . You right leave study time . If choose stop participating study , ask return clinic final clinic visit . At visit , complete medical history record , physical exam blood drawn routine test ( 3 teaspoon ) research purpose ( 4 teaspoon ) . Your study doctor also ask current smoking use , medication take , feeling ( symptom ) . This research study include two bronchoscopies do one year apart . These bronchoscopies do primarily research purpose unlikely provide information useful individual treatment . These bronchoscopies risk associate . These risk describe section 4 informed consent document . Recent research early stage NSCLC indicate adjuvant chemotherapy surgery increase length time person may survive length time cancer recurs . However , adjuvant chemotherapy also side effect severe rare case fatal . If surgery NSCLC wish receive adjuvant chemotherapy , may enroll Vanguard study complete adjuvant chemotherapy . As part study provide sample lung tissue , saliva , blood , scraping inside cheek . Fluid mucous collect bronchoscopies also collect . These sample study scientist learn gene protein people treat early NSCLC HNSCC . The sample also use grow cell culture use test chemotherapy drug . These cell culture also use learn gene protein . All M. D. Anderson researcher train importance maintain patient privacy . Your privacy protect assign number use place name document part study . A list link name study number store restrict file may access password . Only essential research personnel access password . At end study automatically notify research finding . If wish learn result , however , may request principal investigator : Principal Investigator : Waun Ki Hong , MD 1515 Holcombe Blvd. , Unit 432 MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston , TX 77030 This investigational study . A total 50 individual take part study . Participants enrol M. D. Anderson several site around country .</detailed_description>
