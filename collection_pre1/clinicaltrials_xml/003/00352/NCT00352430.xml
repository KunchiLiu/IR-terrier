	<brief_summary>This study evaluate new treatment people pulmonary hypertension , high blood pressure lung , cause sickle cell anemia thalassemia . Patients age 18 old diagnosis sickle cell disease thalassemia , mild severe pulmonary hypertension , pregnant breastfeeding may eligible study . There three stage study , 200 participant screen . Patients undergo pulmonary function test , include asthma measurement oxygen level arterial blood . They chest X-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan lung , ventilation perfusion lung scan look blood clot , echocardiogram , test measure far patient walk 6 minute , nighttime oxygen measurement do asleep , blood collection , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan heart , exercise test . About 3 4 day need test , do patient outpatient , except sleep study . For CT scan , patient lie table X-ray beam take image lung heart . The lung scan involve breathe small amount radioactive aerosol call Tc99m DTPA picture take lung various angle . Then injection albumin , protein small amount radioactivity , give , lung picture take . For MRI scan , patient lie table slide machine . A medication call gadolinium inject , help improve image make scan . After test , patient admit Clinical Center 1 day . A small plastic catheter , tube , place vein arm . A longer catheter go deep vein ( neck leg ) , pulmonary artery catheter insert measure blood pressure blood vessel . Doctors guide catheter lung artery . Patients ask pedal stationary bicycle heart lung pressure measure . If pulmonary hypertension present , patient proceed second stage ( 50 participant ) . While catheter still place , patient wear face mask breathe nitric oxide ( NO ) 20 minute . They take 50 mg sildenafil mouth , pressure heart lung monitor 4 hour . They receive NO another 20 minute . Blood sample take , heart rhythm pressure lung monitor . Sildenafil cause headache , flushing , indigestion . Side effect lung scan involve allergic reaction DTPA albumin . Patients allergy eggs test . Up 25 patient enter third stage . They breathe NO use tank gas delivers tube nose , period 6 week . They continue take sildenafil previously prescribe visit clinic every 2 4 week echocardiogram , blood test , 6-minute walk test . After 6 week , patient catheterization heart measure pressure heart lung . Then NO stop , pressure lung check see NO help low blood pressure-and make sure blood pressure increase medication stop . Patients whose symptom improve result breathe NO may wish continue therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sickle cell anemia autosomal recessive disorder common genetic disease affect African-Americans . Approximately 0.15 % African-Americans homozygous sickle cell disease , 8 % sickle cell trait . Acute pain crisis , acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) , secondary pulmonary hypertension common complication sickle cell anemia . Pulmonary hypertension identify major cause death adult sickle cell disease . Similarly , pulmonary hypertension identify chronic complication hemolytic disorder thalassemia , hereditary spherocytosis paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria . Sildenafil propose possible therapy primary secondary pulmonary hypertension recent phase I/II study intramural NIH suggest well tolerate efficacious population . Furthermore , number recent study suggest NO base therapy may favorable impact sickle red cell molecular level could improve abnormal microvascular perfusion characteristic sickle cell anemia . This clinical trial design three major objective : 1 ) ass cardiopulmonary function patient sickle cell disease thalassemia without pulmonary hypertension , 2 ) determine relative acute vasodilatory effect sildenafil , inhale NO patient hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension 3 ) determine chronic effect addition inhale NO pulmonary hemodynamics functional capacity patient hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension chronically treat sildenafil .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Males female , 18 year age old . Diagnosis sickle cell disease ( electrophoretic documentation SS , SC , S thalassemia genotype require ) thalassemia . For female subject , reliable method birth control physically able bear child . &lt; TAB &gt; For Stage II : Mild severe pulmonary hypertension mean pulmonary artery pressure great 25 mm Hg rest great 30 mm Hg exercise , measure pulmonary artery catheterization . Pulmonary artery wedge pressure leave ventricular enddiastolic pressure less equal 18 mm Hg gradient pulmonary artery diastolic pressure wedge pressure great 8 mm Hg echocardiographic criterion exclude leave ventricular dysfunction . For female subject , reliable method birth control physically able bear child . For Stage III : Mild severe pulmonary hypertension mean pulmonary artery pressure great 25 mm Hg rest great 30 mm Hg exercise , measure pulmonary artery catheterization patient chronic sildenafil therapy least three month . Patients receive combination drug therapy drug ( e.g. , endothelin antagonist , prostacyclins ) allow participate stage III long sildenafil one component combination regimen . Pulmonary artery wedge pressure leave ventricular enddiastolic pressure less equal 18 mm Hg gradient pulmonary artery diastolic pressure wedge pressure great 8 mm Hg echocardiographic criterion exclude leave ventricular dysfunction . Must chronic sildenafil therapy stable dose least three month . For female subject , reliable method birth control physically able bear child . EXCLUSION CRITERIA For Stage I Current pregnancy lactation . Any condition opinion study investigator would adversely affect outcome study safety volunteer . For Stage II III : Current pregnancy lactation . Any following medical condition 1 . Stroke within last six week . 2 . History sustain priapism require medical surgical treatment , unless currently impotent exchange transfusion therapy , within two year .</criteria>
