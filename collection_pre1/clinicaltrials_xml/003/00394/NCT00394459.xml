	<detailed_description>Epidural anaesthesia central neuraxial block technique many application . Improvements equipment , drug technique make popular versatile anaesthetic technique , application surgery , obstetrics pain control . Both single injection catheter technique use . Its versatility mean use anaesthetic , analgesic adjuvant general anaesthesia , postoperative analgesia procedure involve low limb , perineum , pelvis , abdomen thorax . Although epidural anaesthesia safe technique , insertion epidural catheter several side effect may occur , include transient paraesthesia inadvertent vascular cannulation . Reported incidence paraesthesia vary widely 0.2 % 50 % different article , depend catheter ( catheter material , soft-tipped firm-tipped catheter ) , apply technique ( lumbar thoracic epidural anaesthesia , depth catheter insertion ) , approach ( midline paramedian ) include patient ( obstetrical non-obstetrical ) . Paraesthesias suppose lead permanent neurological sequela , unpleasant perturb sensation patient . Besides inadvertent intrathecal location catheter , problem include technical difficulty thread removal catheter . Here , catheter shaft material seem crucial factor incidence problem . Based upon year experience , wide range epidural catheter create , among Perifix catheter B. Braun . Common feature high tensile strength stretch resistance , excellent shaft stability easy visualisation blood spinal fluid due crystal clear material , risk form loop knot , soften catheter within hour due water absorption polyamide material . Recently , B. Braun Melsungen AG develop new generation Perifix epidural catheter , already CE-labeled . These new catheter different composition compare current Perifix Standard catheter regard catheter material tip configuration . They outer poly-urethane liner inner polyamide body . Experimental test show positive feature ( e.g . pushability , kink resistance , glide , withdrawal ) Perifix Standard catheter maintain . Due polyurethane outer layer , catheter get soft reach body temperature immediately upon insertion . Based , expect paraesthesias catheter injection reduce least 20 % .</detailed_description>
