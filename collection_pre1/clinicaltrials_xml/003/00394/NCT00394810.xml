	<criteria>1 . Patients ( pt ) must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . 2 . Pts must evidence progressive metastatic disease ( e.g. , new lesion bone scan new/enlarging lesion computerize tomography [ CT ] scan ) know metastatic disease rise PSA , treatment taxanebased regimen ( well subsequent noncytotoxic therapy ) . Pts bone metastasis ( i.e. , lack softtissue disease ) must PSA level 10 ng/mL high . Pts soft tissue metastasis and/or visceral disease must either measurable disease ( per RECIST criterion ) PSA level 10 ng/mL high . For pt stable metastatic disease rise PSA : two consecutive rise PSA measurement necessary , separate previous minimum two week . The recent PSA value must obtain within 1 week prior registration . At least 3 PSA value within 6 month registration ( separate least 2 week ) use clinical laboratory need available calculation PSA pretreatment slope . Only value obtain last treatment date ( see inclusion criterion # 5 ) acceptable . 3 . Pts must prior treatment bilateral orchiectomy primary hormonal therapy evidence treatment failure . Pts undergone bilateral orchiectomy must continue luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist therapy ( e.g. , leuprolide goserelin ) LHRH antagonist ( e.g . abarelix ) receive protocol therapy . A serum testosterone level 50 ng/dL low require confirm castration status within 4 week prior study entry . 4 . For pt previously treat flutamide ( Eulixin ) , Nilutamide ( Nilandron ) , bicalutamide ( Casodex ) : pt must discontinue flutamide 4 week prior registration continue evidence progressive disease . For bicalutamide nilutamide , pt must discontinue drug 6 week prior registration evidence progressive disease . • Disease progression follow antiandrogen withdrawal need confirm rise PSA require 46 week washout period ( e.g . PSA level high last PSA obtain antiandrogen therapy ) . 5 . Pts must receive one prior taxanebased regimen metastatic disease , evidence disease progression ( inclusion criterion # 2 ) treatment within 6 month treatment discontinuation . Up one prior experimental therapy ( noncytotoxic ) permit . At least 4 week previous treatment must elapse prior registration , evidence disease progression outline inclusion criterion # 2 . 6 . Age ≥18 year . 7 . Life expectancy great 12 week . 8 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ ECOG ] performance status 2 less 9 . Pts must near normal organ marrow function within 2 week prior registration define : Granulocytes &gt; 1500/mm³ Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm³ Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 mg/dL Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; 2 time institutional upper limit normal Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/min 10 . Pts history prior malignancy eligible provide treated curative intent free disease 5 year ( exclude nonmelanomatous skin cancer treat curative intent ) . 11 . All sit disease must evaluate within 4 week prior registration . 12 . Have ability understand requirement study , provide write informed consent authorization release protect health information , abide study restriction , agree return require assessment . 1 . The use bisphosphonates ( i.e . pamidronate sodium zoledronic acid ) allow provide patient receive medication 4 week evidence progressive disease outline . • Pts allow start bisphosphonate receive protocol treatment unless clinically indicate ( need approval study principal investigator ) . Those patient already bisphosphonate need continue receive bisphosphonate previously schedule . 2 . Pts must prior radiotherapy within 4 week prior registration . Patient prior Strontium 89 , Samarium 153 , radioisotope . • If pt require palliative radiotherapy , two consecutive rise ( baseline value must obtain completion radiation treatment ) PSA measurement necessary , separate previous minimum two week . 3 . No concurrent use estrogen , estrogenlike agent ( i.e . PCSPES , Saw Palmetto , herbal product may contain phytoestrogens ) , hormonal therapy ( include megastrol acetate , finasteride , ketoconazole , systemic corticosteroid ) allow time study . Prior use agent need discontinue 4 week prior enrollment . Disease progression need confirm outlined inclusion criterion # 2 . 4 . Pts type I insulindependent diabetes poorlycontrolled type II insulindependent diabetes fast blood glucose 10 mmol/L ( 200 mg/dL ) exclude due difficulty evaluate tumor metabolic activity use FDGPET . 5 . Patients must active angina pectoris , know heart disease New York Heart Association Class IIIIV . Patients must history myocardial infarction within 6 month prior registration . No history evidence ventricular dysrhythmias unstable arrythmia allow ( rate control atrial fibrillation allow patient asymptomatic cardiac standpoint ) . 6 . Patients must know history carcinomatous meningitis brain metastasis . 7 . No serious concurrent medical illness active infection present would jeopardize ability patient receive therapy outline protocol reasonable safety . 8 . No major surgery within 21 day start treatment Panzem NCD . 9 . Pts must receive investigational agent Panzem NCD duration participation trial .</criteria>
