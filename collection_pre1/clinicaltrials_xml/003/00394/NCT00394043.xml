	<detailed_description>The incidence Carpal Tunnel Syndrome ( CTS ) adults U.S. range 15-20 % depend study , cost one billion dollar annually medical care . Surgery CTS account much cost one third patient experience re-occurrence symptom post-operatively . The overall goal propose exploratory clinical trial evaluate efficacy conservative , manual medicine treatment adjunctive therapy standard care CTS . This pilot study utilized prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial methodology examine whether eight week treatment regimen osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) use adjunctively standard therapy would immediate lasting positive effect symptom , functional limitation , physiologic impairment associate CTS . Male female subject age 20 65 meet electro-physiologic symptom/functional inclusion criterion randomly assign one three study group , continue standard medical care treat physician/provider ; ( ) OMT plus standard medical care ; ( ii ) placebo ( sub-therapeutic ultrasound ) plus standard medical care ; ( iii ) standard medical care ( no-treat ) . Outcome measure : 1 . Median Ulnar motor sensory nerve conduction amplitude distal latency , 2 . Symptoms Functional status , 3 . Strength , 4 . Sensation , 5 . Interior dimension carpal tunnel , 6 . Quantification ( signal intensity MRI ) water ( edema ) Median nerve carpal tunnel . Placebo potency blind success evaluate . A preliminary investigation demonstrate ability recruit subject measure outcome . Power analysis base upon decrease mean median motor nerve distal latency 30 % identify minimum number 42 subject per treatment group . It expect significantly great number subject OMT adjunctive treatment group would achieve effective change nerve latency compare two treatment group . It also expect OMT adjunctive treatment group would great improvement physiological clinical outcome measure two group .</detailed_description>
