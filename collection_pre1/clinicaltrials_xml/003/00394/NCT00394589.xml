	<brief_summary>This Phase IIIb , randomize , multi-national , multi-center , blind study Infliximab ( IFX ) subject age 18 old active RA conduct assess whether increase either infusion dose infusion frequency patient present disease flare initial response infliximab result significant improvement disease activity . Subjects respond initial infliximab treatment regimen , flare continuation treatment 3 mg/kg administer every 8 week , randomly assign one 3 different dose regimen infliximab treat 4 5 consecutive infusion total duration 24 week . The infliximab control group infliximab increase dose group evaluator subject-blinded . The increased frequency group blind . Clinical assessment disease activity base European League Against Rheumatism ( EULAR ) criteria response . Safety parameter assess every infusion . A disease flare define increase DAS28 0.6 screening , compare DAS28 score measure immediately prior last Remicade® infusion depend upon actual score well . Since prior enrollment , subject receive Remicade® per routine clinical practice , day infusion administer assessment do induction period exactly Week 2 , 6 14 . - Drug : Infliximab Control ( double-blinded ) - Drug : Infliximab Increased Dose ( double-blinded ) - Drug : Infliximab Increased Frequency ( open-label )</brief_summary>
