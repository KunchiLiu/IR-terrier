	<brief_summary>X-linked Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) inherit disorder cause abnormal gene fails make protein know gp91 phox . This protein part group proteins work create hydrogen peroxide neutrophil . Neutrophils type white blood cell help fight infection . As result , patient make gp91 phox frequently develop life-threatening infection . In addition , neutrophil often act abnormally , result creation granuloma , abnormal collection cell . These granulomas become large enough block organ , bladder and/or intestine , cause significant problem . Patients usually treat antibiotic ( often need extend period time ) infection cause CGD , corticosteroids granuloma . However , drug cure CGD , significant side effect . Thus patient CGD normal life expectancy . The available cure date CGD Bone Marrow Transplantation ( BMT ) , blood-making cell specially match brother sister donor ( allogeneic ) similarly match unrelated donor give patient patient undergone kind chemotherapy radiation preparation receive cell . If cell donor engraft ( survive marrow ) , patient cure ; however , risk cell may engraft may later get reject body . Also , cell donor react patient , cause serious disorder call `` Graft Versus Host Disease '' ( GVHD ) . Although number method use try reduce and/or prevent graft rejection and/or GVHD , complication still occur even new method develop . The risk complication low brother sister use donor ; however , patient ( even sibling ) ideally match donor . Hence , transplantation , especially use unrelated donor , always perfect cure . Because gene responsible make gp91 phox know , possible use gene therapy try cure disease . In gene therapy , blood-making cell take patient use technique call apheresis . The normal gene place cell use special virus call retrovirus . The cell able produce normal protein . In trial , patient receive small dose chemotherapy call busulfan , low traditionally use allogeneic BMT , newly correct cell put back patient . Even best standard care , number patient CGD still die infection . For patient unresponsive progressive infection possible sibling donor , hope either Matched Unrelated Donor ( MUD ) transplant , high risk cause death , gene therapy . Hence , would propose use gene therapy patient less risk cause death , still possibly offer cure . Even correct cell remain life long rid patient entirely disease , long persist even month , would able least clear current infection patient consider enrollment protocol . Further , would still eligible undergo match unrelated donor transplant event gene therapy confer benefit .</brief_summary>
