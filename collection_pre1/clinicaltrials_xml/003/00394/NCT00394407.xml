	<brief_summary>High blood glucose level hospitalize patient diabetes associate increased risk medical complication . Improved glucose control insulin injection may improve clinical outcome prevent hospital complication . It know ; however , best insulin regimen hospitalize patient . The use repeat injection regular insulin ( know slide scale regimen ) one commonly used insulin regimen glucose control hospitalize patient diabetes . Recently , combination basal rapid act insulin show improve glucose control lower rate hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study compare well regular insulin compare glargine ( Lantus® ) daily plus glulisine ( Apidra® ) insulin meal hospitalize patient type 2 diabetes elevate blood glucose ( sugar ) level . Lantus long-acting insulin give subcutaneously ( skin ) daily . Apidra rapid-acting insulin give subcutaneously several time day frequently meal . Regular insulin short-acting insulin clinical use 20 year also give subcutaneously several time per day . Lantus , Apidra regular insulin approve use treatment patient diabetes FDA . This investigator-initiated research conduct Grady Memorial Hospital , Atlanta Jackson Memorial Hospital , Miami . Dr. Umpierrez design study serve principal investigator . A total 65 patient recruit Grady 65 patient Jackson Memorial Hospital . This study support Sanofi-Aventis Pharmaceuticals .</detailed_description>
