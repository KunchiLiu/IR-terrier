	<brief_summary>Surgical method offer patient chronic low back pain controversial . In addition , new expensive treatment method like total disc replacemet ( TDR ) challenge health care service . At present , ongoing randomize study Europe USA compare TDR fusion . However , knowledge , randomize trial compare TDR non-surgical treatment . The aim present study evaluate effect comprehensive structure non-surgical treatment TDR surgery patient chronic low back pain localize degenerative disc change . Main hypothesis : There difference treatment effect surgery lumbar total disc prosthesis multidisciplinary rehabilitation program measure Oswestry Disability Index 1 2 year . Secondary hypothesis : There difference cost - effectiveness surgery lumbar disc prosthesis multidisciplinary rehabilitation program 1 2 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Description intervention . Surgical intervention : The surgical intervention consist replacement degenerative intervertebral lumbar disc artificial lumbar disc device ( ProDisc II , Spine Solutions Inc. , New York , NY ) . The ProDisc consist three piece , two metal endplate polyethylene core fix inferior endplate device implant , implanted retroperitoneal ( transperitoneal ) access . Depending surgeon , Pfannenstiel incision para median incision use . A fluoroscope use ensure prosthesis place midline sufficiently towards posterior edge corpus vertebra . All hospital participate study use artificial lumbar disc device , standard instrument manufacturer use insert disc . Postoperatively , orthoses use , patient give restriction heavy lift excessive movement first 6 week surgery . Otherwise , instruction give . Six week surgery , patient refer physiotherapy . Non-surgical intervention : The intervention base treatment model describe Brox et al ( Spine 2003 ; 28:1913-1921 ) consist cognitive approach supervise physical exercise . The treatment interdisciplinary direct team physiotherapist specialist physical medicine rehabilitation . The intervention organize outpatient treatment group 6 - 8 patient period 12 - 15 treatment day . In agreement patient , individual goal rehabilitation process establish . Sub-studies : Several sub - project conduct different hospital study , example validation discography , RSA validate migration motion prosthesis , biomechanical study use DCRA technique , validation classification system physiotherapy responsiveness questionnaire include study .</detailed_description>

Oswestry Disability Index score 30 % point Degenerative change intervertebral disc one two lowest level lumbar spine ( L4/L5 and/or L5/S1 ) . ( Degenerative change classify base MR finding accord follow criterion : At least 40 % reduction disc height , Modic change type I and/or II , `` High intensity zone '' disc , Morphological change classify change signal intensity disc . To classify disc degenerative first criteria alone least two criterion must present . The MR series evaluate two independent observer . ) Generalized chronic pain syndrome ( widespread myofascial pain ) Degeneration establish two level . To classify normal disc , disc height must reduce 40 % criterion degenerative disc disease aforementioned must absent . The classification normal disc perform two independent observer .
