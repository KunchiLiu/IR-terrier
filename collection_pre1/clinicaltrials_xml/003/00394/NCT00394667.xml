	<criteria>Obese patient 30 kg/m² ≤ BMI ≤ 40 kg/m² Males females 18 65 year age , extremes include Patients continuously receive diet therapy well instruction exercise least 2 week runin , runin randomization gain weight ( &lt; 2 kg ) Females childbearing potential must nonpregnant use safe contraceptive method ( pill , IUD surgically sterilize ) Patients able comply study procedure Smoking habit stable least 2 month Patients give write informed consent Use prescription medication list Positive serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential Pregnant lactate woman , woman plan become pregnant within next 8 month Patients specific disease interfere metabolism e.g . untreated myxoedema , Cushing 's syndrome , Type 1 diabetes mellitus , significant neurological psychiatric illness epilepsy , schizophrenia , depression , eat disorder bulimia . Patients Type 2 diabetes mellitus ineligible unless antidiabetic medication deem necessary investigator fasting ( venous arterialize capillary full blood finger ear ) blood glucose &gt; 6.1 mmol/l screening . Retest allow first measure inclusion value . The corresponding exclusion criterion plasma glucose 7.0 mmol/l Patients currently ( within past 2 month ) know abuse dependent drug , include alcohol ( weekly consumption &gt; 21 unit alcohol ( men ) &gt; 14 unit alcohol ( woman ) ) Hepatic renal dysfunction ( ASAT and/or ALAT &gt; 2 x ULN creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min estimate central laboratory use Cockcroft Gault formula , respectively ) Known untreated hypercholesterolaemia ( &gt; 7 mmol/l ) . Patients well regulate cholesterol use drug hypercholesterolaemia allow inclusion Known untreated hypertriglyceridaemia ( &gt; 3 mmol/l ) . Patients well regulate triglyceride level use drug hypertriglyceridaemia allow inclusion Drug treat thyroid disease ( well substitute hypothyroidism allow ) Patients suffer hyperthyroid disease allow study , even though may well treat drug Patients , recently diagnose , yet stable hypothyroid disease allow study Patients suffer longstanding stable hypothyroid disease , well treated substitution allow included include hypothyroidism sequelae definitive treatment hyperthyroidism surgery radioactive iodine Malabsorptive intestinal disorder assume affect absorption tesofensine Special diet ( e.g. , vegetarian , Atkins ) Patients plan major change physical activity study extent may interfere study outcome , judge investigator Weight change &gt; 3 kg within 2 month prior screen Mental psychiatric disorder base medical history Surgically treat obesity Patients systemic infection inflammatory disease History presence significant cardiovascular disease heart failure , ischemic heart disease , stroke , transient ischemic attack Significant abnormality ECG . accord investigator opinion . Additional exclusionary ECG value : QTcB &gt; 480 millisecond ( m ) , PR interval &gt; 240 m , QRS interval &gt; 120 m Hypotension ( i.e . supine systolic BP &lt; 90 mm Hg ) and/or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension ( clinical symptom orthostatic hypotension associate decline ≥ 20 mm Hg systolic BP one minute standing compare previous supine systolic BP obtain 5 minute quiet rest ) screen visit Uncontrolled hypertension ( i.e . sit diastolic BP ≥ 95 mm Hg sit systolic BP ≥ 155 mm Hg ) despite treatment &gt; 4 week prior screen visit well HR &gt; 90 bpm Known HIV infection ( test require ) Serologic evidence active hepatitis B and/or C History cancer within past 5 year , exclude treat basal cell carcinoma Clinically significant potentially disable eye disorder , include uncontrolled glaucoma Current treatment medication know ocular toxicity chloroquine hydroxychloroquine prohibit Patients previously treat tesofensine Patients treat investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose study drug</criteria>
