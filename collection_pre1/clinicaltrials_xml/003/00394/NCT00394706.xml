	<brief_title>Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium ( ROC ) Prehospital Resuscitation Using Impedance Valve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The first treatment involve use device call Impedance Threshold Device ( ITD ) . The ITD small hard plastic device size fist attach face mask airway tube use CPR ( cardiopulmonary resuscitation ) . The ITD provide increase blood flow back heart chest compression heart start beat . The treatment involve amount CPR give emergency medical service ( EMS ) provider first look heart rhythm determine shock need . A person would receive either 30 second chest compression 3 minute compression check heart rhythm . Giving compression check heart rhythm increase blood circulate body . Researchers know many compression rhythm check necessary save life . Depending circumstance cardiac arrest person may receive one treatment treatment . The purpose research study determine people live either real ITD use additional CPR give look heart rhythm first time . This study conduct 9 different area throughout United States Canada Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium ( ROC ) . About 15,000 patient enrol research study .</detailed_description>
