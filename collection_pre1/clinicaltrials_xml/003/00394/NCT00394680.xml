	<detailed_description>Cardio-vascular disease second lead cause death western world . Two mode treatment currently use : Coronary Artery Bypass Graft ( CABG ) Percutaneous Interventions ( PCIs ) i.e : balloon angioplasty stent [ bare metal ( BMS ) drug elute ( DES ) ] . CABG major operation consider safe good quality life year follow . The initial cost CABG high usually stay low thereafter . PCI less invasive downfall high rate restenosis hence lead return angina . The initial cost low due return symptom cost increase . The goal DES low rate restenosis thus reduce need repeat hospitalization procedure . The initial cost stent high BMS still low CABG . The goal study ass compare average annual cost treatment patient multi-vessel disease underwent one follow procedure : 1 . CABG 2 . DES 3 . BMS The information study derive data base cardiology cardio-thoracic surgery department Shaarey-Zedek hospital Clalit Health Services Kupat Holim Meuhedet . The study design historical prospective . The participant insure mentioned HMOs treat 2000-2004 . The final sample 's size decide accord pilot study 15 patient treatment group . To knowledge study compare CABG DES yet publish . We believe study could become mile stone process choose suitable treatment patient health system .</detailed_description>
