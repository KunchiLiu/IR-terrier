	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy After Prostatectomy Treating Patients With Stage III Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Compare disease-free survival rate patient randomly assign adjuvant external-beam radiotherapy vs. adjuvant therapy follow radical prostatectomy pelvic lymphadenectomy surgical Stage C ( T3 N0 M0 ) adenocarcinoma prostate . II . Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity associate adjuvant therapy . OUTLINE : Randomized study . Randomization take place patient physically able begin treatment , time within 16 week surgery . Arm I : Radiotherapy . Irradiation prostatic bed use megavoltage equipment effective photon energy great 4 MV . Arm II : No treatment .</detailed_description>
