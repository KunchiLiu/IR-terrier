	<detailed_description>Large hemangioma face associate anomaly blood vessel head chest . The acronym PHACES indicate association Posterior fossa brain malformation , facial Hemangioma , Arterial anomaly , Coarctation aorta cardiac defect , Eye abnormalities Sternal malformation . Study subject recruit Pediatric Dermatology department several city . All patient age 0-1 year old age , present large facial hemangioma ( &gt; 22 cm^2 ) offer participate study . Parents interview obtain personal , medical , family history . Patients undergo standard care evaluation facial hemangioma risk PHACE syndrome . This include skin , eye neurological examination , photograph , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head/neck/chest , lab test require sample blood , urine stool . No test perform participate study . Lumbosacral hemangioma infancy ( hemangioma low back ) associate anomaly spine . `` Tethered cord syndrome '' indicate condition cause abnormally stretch spinal cord . Over time condition lead neurological damage . Although often symptoms adulthood , become apparent childhood . Common symptom : low back pain , pain weakness leg , walk problem , bladder bowel loss control . `` Occult spinal dysraphism '' term use defect spine hide normal skin . We notice infant hemangioma low back area incline present hidden spine defect . Study subject recruit Pediatric Dermatology department several city . All patient age 0-18 year old age , present lumbosacral hemangioma ( &gt; 2.5 cm diameter overlie spine ) offer participate study . Parents interview obtain personal , medical , family history . Patients undergo standard care evaluation lumbosacral hemangioma . This include skin , neurological examination , photograph , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) back , lab test require sample blood , urine stool . No additional test perform participate study .</detailed_description>
