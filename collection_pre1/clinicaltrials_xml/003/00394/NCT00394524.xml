	<brief_summary>High blood sugar increase risk complication death diabetic patient admit hospital . Recent study hve show strict blood sugar control intravenous ( IV ) insulin lower risk complication death ICU . Several insulin infusion protocol report literature , know best . These protocol use table formula may confuse difficult follow . To facilitate patient care , insulin protocol could place computer use patient 's bedside direct nursing staff administer IV insulin . The Glucommander one computer-derived insulin infusion protocol use successfully patient diabetes since 1984 . We hypothesize management inpatient hyperglycemia computer-guided intravenous infusion protocol facilitate smoother glycemic control lower rate low blood sugar treatment follow standard insulin infusion algorithm medical intensive care unit . We aim determine difference glycemic control treatment computer-guided intravenous infusion protocol ( Glucommander ) standard insulin infusion algorithm critically ill patient ICU .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Between Computer-Guided Insulin Infusion Protocol Versus Standard Insulin Infusion Algorithm Medical ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Summary : Increasing evidence observational study hospitalize patient without diabetes indicate hyperglycemia predictor poor outcome . Blood glucose control intensive insulin therapy patient acute critical illness reduces risk multiorgan failure systemic infection , decrease short- long-term mortality . The use intravenous insulin infusion prefer route insulin administration management diabetic subject diabetic ketoacidosis nonketotic hyperosmolar state , intraoperative postoperative care , postoperative period follow heart surgery organ transplantation , acute myocardial infarction , stroke , critical care illness . Some setting may characterize , associate , severe rapidly change insulin requirement , generalize patient edema , impaired perfusion subcutaneous site , requirement pressor support , and/or use total parenteral nutrition . In setting , intravenous route insulin administration consider superior subcutaneous injection split-mixed regimen intermediate regular insulin respect rapidity effect control hyperglycemia , overall ability achieve glycemic control , importantly , prevent hypoglycemic episode . Recently , several insulin infusion protocol report literature ; algorithm formula , however , may confuse difficult follow may increase risk dose error . To facilitate patient care , insulin algorithm could place computer use patient bedside direct nursing staff administer intravenous insulin . The Glucommander one computer-derived insulin infusion protocol use successfully 5,802 patient diabetes 1984 1998 . We hypothesize management inpatient hyperglycemia computer-guided intravenous infusion protocol facilitate smoother glycemic control lower rate hypoglycemic event treatment follow standard insulin infusion algorithm critically ill patient medical ICU . We aim determine difference glycemic control treatment computer-guided intravenous infusion protocol ( Glucommander ) standard insulin infusion algorithm critically ill patient ICU .</detailed_description>

A known history diabetes mellitus new hyperglycemia untreated treated diet , insulin therapy combination antidiabetic agent ( sulfonylurea , metformin , thiazolidinediones ) . Blood glucose great 120 mg/dl ≥ 2 occasion know , treat diabetic great 140 mg/dl ≥ 2 occasion new hyperglycemia . 3 . Subjects must admission blood glucose &lt; 400 mg/dL , without laboratory evidence diabetic ketoacidosis ( serum bicarbonate &lt; 18 milliequivalents/L positive serum urinary ketone ) . 1 . Subjects acute hyperglycemic crisis diabetic ketoacidosis ( DKA ) hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state [ 38 ] . 2 . Patients know HIV , severely impaired renal function ( serum creatinine ≥3.0 mg/dl ) . 3 . Patients mental condition render subject unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study . 4 . Female subject pregnant breast feeding time enrollment study .</criteria>
