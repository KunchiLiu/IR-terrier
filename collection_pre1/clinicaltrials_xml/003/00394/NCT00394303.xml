	<brief_summary>Blood glucose level increase response stress , infection condition face patient hospital . This occur commonly among patient know diabetes , also among non-diabetic hospitalized patient . Tight glucose control , maintenance blood glucose level within normal limit ( 80-120 mg/dl ) , show improve patient outcome hospital several setting , mainly among critically ill patient hospitalize intensive care unit . We plan assess importance tight glucose control open-heart surgery . The prevalence hyperglycemia ( elevate blood glucose ) operation high . Hyperglycemia may associate increased vulnerability surgical site infection , neurological damage , cardiac renal injury . Conversely , tight glucose control may associate hypoglycemia ( pathologically low glucose level ) may result neurological injury . We hypothesize tight glucose control improve patient outcome follow surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tight Intra-Operative Glucose Control During Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current evidence support intensive glucose control patient intensive care unit post-cardiac surgery . The risk-benefit ratio tight glucose control use continuous insulin infusion surgery establish . Pros tight control include association hyperglycemia neurological injury , cardiac ischemia , white blood cell dysfunction renal failure . The con include adverse effect , mainly hypoglycemia hypokalemia . As intervention medicine , tight intra-operative glucose control assess randomize control trial . Objectives : ass whether tight intra-operative tight glucose control use continuous insulin infusion reduce morbidity mortality follow cardiac surgery , define incidence rate surgical site infection , adverse neurological event , renal failure 30-day mortality follow CABG . Additional outcome include effect continuous insulin infusion longer-term mortality ; infectious complication antibiotic use hospitalization ; cardiovascular outcome ; need re-operations ; length hospital stay ; readmission ; hypoglycemia adverse event . Design : randomize controlled trial , blind outcome assessor . Participants : consecutive patient &gt; 18 year undergoing CABG , without without additional valve surgery Rabin Medical Center ; Beilinson campus , provide informed consent . Exclusion criterion : patient diabetic ketoacidosis , hyperosmolar coma . Intervention : Continuous insulin infusion throughout operation aim maintain normoglycemia use nomogram Control : Glucose management accord discretion anesthesiologist ( continuous bolus infusion ) During early post-operative period ( ICU-stay follow surgery ) , patient treat intensive glucose control target glucose level 80-110 .</detailed_description>
