	<brief_title>Assessing Novel Methods Improving Patient Education Nutrition</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Description The relationship elevate phosphorus level morbidity mortality patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) well recognize , dietary phosphorus restriction mainstay phosphate management . Despite , appropriate control phosphate intake remain sub-par , due part difficulty patient understand phosphate content food . Randomized trial show intensive , individualized dietary counseling improve patient knowledge phosphorus help control hyperphosphatemia ; however , maintain level counsel time-consuming , costly , impractical . Given recognize nephrology workforce shortage , crucial need system fill gap novel technology educate patient , vital well understanding effect novel nutritional intervention counsel method patient knowledge , nutritional intake nutritional status evaluate CKD patient . Furthermore , effectively engage patient side education process , receive , patient , must able comprehend information draw decision-making . Novel educational intervention may well suit traditional method circumvent literacy limitation . Therefore , vital ass relation functional health literacy population traditional emerge educational venue . Finally , importance phosphorus control patient CKD traditionally prevent bone disease . More recently recognize poor phosphorus control correlate cardiovascular disease , patient CKD carry enormous burden . Similarly , recently much attention circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) novel marker cardiovascular risk population . While ultimate test would determine control phosphorus impact cardiovascular event , beyond scope project . Therefore , propose measure level CECs intermediary step toward cardiovascular event , correlation phosphorus intake . Hypothesis 1 : Novel nutritional educational intervention dietary phosphorus useful provide improvement phosphorus knowledge control intake . Significance : Such method self-sustaining , therefore practical solution problem provide continuous repeat educational intervention give limited provider time resource . Hypothesis 2 : A high level health literacy individual CKD associate great knowledge compliance recommend dietary phosphorus intake . Significance : A good understanding obstacle optimal nutritional intake lead improve method nutrition intervention counsel . Alternative measure educate low health literacy may require shift resource subgroup individual . Hypothesis 3 : Higher dietary phosphorus intake individual CKD correlate high level CECs . Study Design Specific Aim 1 : To examine effect novel , web-based method educate CKD patient patient knowledge dietary intake phosphorus . We compare 2 method educate CKD patient dietary phosphorus intake : 1 . Usual care , consist individualized care/counseling nephrologist . 2 . Usual care , plus review Kidney School ( KS ) Nutrition Module ( see ) . To compare gain phosphorus knowledge 1 month . To compare compliance dietary phosphorus intake , measure mineral metabolism laboratory value ( serum phosphorus , calcium , PTH , calcium-phosphorus product ) 3-day dietary diary . Specific Aim 2 : To determine S-TOFHLA predicts CKD patient ' knowledge compliance recommend dietary phosphorus intake : 1 . To measure health literacy patient undergoing maintenance hemodialysis , use S-TOFHLA . 2 . To assess correlation health literacy knowledge phosphorus . 3 . To assess correlation health literacy compliance CKD dietary phosphorus guideline , measure mineral metabolism laboratory value ( serum phosphorus , calcium , PTH , calcium-phosphorus product ) , dietary phosphate intake , measure 3-day dietary diary . 4 . To assess correlation health literacy compliance CKD dietary phosphorus guideline , follow usual care versus eHealth nutrition intervention . Specific Aim 3 : To determine high dietary phosphorus intake correlate high level CECs . 1 . To measure CEC level patient CKD . 2 . To assess correlation dietary phosphorus intake , serum phosphorus level , CECs patient CKD . Following enrollment inform consent , subject randomize one two arm ( group1 : usual care ; group 2 : usual care plus KS module ) . All subject undergo baseline data collection , show table 1 . KS Survey information follow : Kidney School ( KS ) . KS ( http : //www.kidneyschool.org ) online , personalize , interactive self-management learning center create Madison , WI base Medical Education Institute ( MEI ) organize fifteen 20-30 minute module , focus different topic relate kidney disease treatment , include nutrition . Content base 10 year research conduct Life Options Rehabilitation Program , internal external expert review . The nutrition module tailor patient without diabetes . KS modules contain pre/post-test , instructional content , patient quote , graphics/animations , photo , pop-up , resource list contain book relevant website link , certificate completion . The content branch provide tailor information user accord user response . These response also create Personal Action Plan module print used content review set goal . A custom graphic interface navigation button design KS , module customize Javascript programming , content branching pattern unique . Proprietary Information . The mission non-profit MEI help people chronic disease learn manage improve health , research education . The MEI believe charge fee educational material barrier patient information need live successfully chronic disease . All MEI-developed patient education material therefore free . KS entirely proprietary MEI , continue available free charge via Internet . HIPAA . KS fully compliant HIPAA standard . S-TOFHLA . An abbreviated version test functional health literacy adult , S-TOFHLA widely use health care provider determine adequacy patient ' understand health care material need health care education , well researcher assess health literacy variable research . It categorize individual adequate , marginal inadequate health literacy , administer 12 minute , use patient variety chronic disease . CKD Knowledge Assessment Tool ( CKDKAT ) Nutrition . The CKDKAT nutrition revise version original CKDKAT , address nutritional knowledge specific CKD . Fifteen 25 question phosphorus-specific , remain 10 concern sodium , potassium protein intake . SF-12v2 . The SF-12 Health Survey version 2 12-item measure health relate quality life . Widely use research variety disease state , include CKD , provide physical mental component summary score strong concordance lengthy SF-36 . Given administer multiple cognitive behavioral survey subject , short version use . Kidney Disease Self-Management Survey ( KDSMS ) . Developed MEI , KDSMS 58-item Likert scale 6 subscales , base theory deem important self-management education chronic disease , include health belief model , self-efficacy , behavioral intent , transtheoretical model . These theory converge self-management education schema emphasize importance information , support , modeling , planning , practice monitoring , reflection patient self-management education . The 6 subscales : 1 ) Self-monitoring , 2 ) Adjusting symptom , 3 ) Lifestyle behavior , 4 ) Medication-taking , 5 ) Information seek , 6 ) Doctor/patient communication . 24 hour recall diary . After collect information subject , nutrient analysis perform use The Food Processor SQL Nutrition Software ( ESHA Research , Salem , Oregon ) . The study instrument perform research purpose . While ( S-TOFHLA , 3-Day Dietary Diaries ) use part patient care , routine , do facility . Lab work collect consist serum phosphorus , calcium intact-parathyroid hormone level . As routinely collect prior regular CKD clinic visit , study coordinator check see data already available , duplicate blood work . In addition , subject blood drawn ( 30 ml ) assessment circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) , novel marker vascular damage . Following baseline data collection , group 1 continue schedule clinic visit , group 2 spend approximately 30 minute complete KS nutrition module dedicate computer education station UW Kidney Clinic . The study coordinator bring KS nutrition module ( tailor diabetes co-morbidity appropriate ) . After completion KS nutrition module , patient receive personalize action plan , proceed schedule clinic visit . All subject ask return 30-60 day repeat survey information blood work . Subject Population All subject ( N = 100 ) recruit UW Health Kidney Clinic . We recruit individual later stag kidney disease : Stages 3 4 . Staging CKD determine estimate glomerular filtration rate ( e-GFR ) . The e-GFR automatically calculated outpatient serum creatinine order UW lab , information readily available . Stage 3 define GFR 30-59 milliliters/minute ( ~ ½ ¼ normal kidney function ) , Stage 4 define GFR 15-29 milliliters/minute ( ~ ¼ ⅛ normal kidney function ) . Stage 5 kidney failure ( GFR &lt; 15 milliliters/minute ) . All patient age 18 89 CKD stage 3 4 see UW Health Kidney Clinic invite participate study member study personnel prior begin class wait clinic visit . Fliers briefly describe study contact information interested available receptionist area UW Kidney Clinic computer-station education area . Demographic information collect include age , gender , race , length time know CKD , education level , home computer ownership . Subjects receive modest compensation time effort ( $ 10 completion first set data collection , $ 25 completion follow data collection ) . No project personnel receive incentive recruit human subject purpose directly relate study . The great amount offer second visit due add inconvenience return additional visit . Note , prisoner see UW Kidney Clinic , study involve population . Statistical Justification Sample Size We propose sample size 50 subject cohort . Pairwise comparison mean knowledge score Cohort 2 Cohort 1 ( i.e. , original cohort take test prior educational intervention ) conduct use two-sided t-tests detect p-value &lt; 0.05 . Adjustments make demographic factor know related chronic disease knowledge , include age , race , gender education . The effective sample size provide 80 % power detect difference mean knowledge score 3 question . Correlation high level functional health literacy increase knowledge kidney disease determine use Spearman rank-order correlation . Risks Benefits Participants It anticipate significant sustained risk subject participation study . There potential mild discomfort necessary blood draw , occur twice per subject . Personal benefit subject : Subjects randomize KS nutrition module may receive benefit personalize action plan , may gain knowledge nutritional need chronic condition . Scientific benefit study : A good understanding obstacle optimal nutritional intake lead improve method nutrition intervention counsel . Alternative measure educate low health literacy may require shift resource subgroup individual . Consent Procedures As study require ability fill multiple survey use Internet , individual provide consent participate . The consent process conduct either Study Coordinator ( Lynn Jacobson ) PI ( Jonathan Jaffery ) . Upon agree enroll study , subject copy consent form ( see attach ) . The individual obtaining consent remain available answer question . Changes protocol submit approve : The change make additional funding award look question slightly different patient population . The previously approve study enroll individual chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) stag 3 4 ( moderate severe CKD ) . The propose change include individual CKD 5 ( end-stage kidney disease ) undergo maintenance hemodialysis ( MD ) . Given major difference group patient receive care ( clinic visit average every 3-6 month occasional blood work primarily oral medication arrange per provider discretion CKD 3 4 , versus dialysis unit treatments 3-4 hours/3 time weekly , monthly blood work various oral IV medication prescribe per protocol CKD 5 MD ) , important ass propose question distinct group . 1 . Will enroll additional 80 subject , CKD 5 , undergo MD 2 . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) receive standard care versus intervention tailor , web-based CKD nutrition module 3 . Other intervention ( 80 subject ) questionnaire instrument previously describe 4 . The timetable/duration study different MD group versus CKD 3/4 group ( see ) 5 . No separate blood draw require MD group , relevant lab test measure standard care record dialysis clinical database Subjects CKD 5 decrease risk adverse effect , due lack need blood draw . Additionally , time spend perform study questionnaire engage web-based module ( via wireless-enabled laptop ) 3-4 hour dialysis treatment , prolong visit length . Subjects CKD 3 4 affected change .</detailed_description>
