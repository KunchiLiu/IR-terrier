	<brief_title>Childhood Asthma Research Education ( CARE ) Network Trial - Treating Children Prevent Exacerbations Asthma ( TREXA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Almost 9 million child United States asthma , lead cause hospitalization school absenteeism . Common asthma symptom include wheeze , shortness breath , chest tightness , cough . While cure asthma , child receive proper treatment able control symptom lead normal life . Asthma commonly treat two type medication : long-term control medication , inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) , take regular schedule prevent symptom keep asthma control , quick-relief , `` rescue '' medication , albuterol , use as-needed-basis onset symptom asthma attack . The purpose study assess impact severity asthma exacerbation occur child mild persistent asthma receive ICS daily basis plus ICS albuterol rescue medication . This study begin 4-week screening period participant monitor use inhaler low dose ICS medication . Study visit occur study entry Week 4 . Participants undergo physical examination , lung function airway pressure test , blood collection . At Week 4 study visit , participant randomly assign one follow four group 44 week treatment : - Group 1 take ICS twice day ICS plus albuterol rescue medication - Group 2 take ICS twice day placebo ICS plus albuterol rescue medication - Group 3 take placebo ICS twice day ICS plus albuterol rescue medication - Group 4 take placebo ICS twice day placebo ICS plus albuterol rescue medication Each participant receive three inhaler assign medication . One inhaler use twice daily throughout study . The two inhaler use consecutively as-needed-basis rescue medication . Study visit occur Weeks 8 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 40 , 48 . A physical examination , blood collection , lung function airway pressure test occur select visit . Questionnaires assess quality life asthma control also complete . A methacholine challenge test complete study visit . This test artificially trigger asthma attack determine severity individual 's asthma . Throughout study , participant record asthma symptom rescue medication usage daily diary .</detailed_description>
