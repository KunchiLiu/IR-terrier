	<brief_summary>The study aim evaluate impact possible new treatment hypertonia , contribute motor disability child cerebral palsy ( CP ) . This study follow 2005-2006 pilot study , demonstrate significant motor improvement 4 child expose low tone via stereophonic Headphones . ( A possible mechanism deep brain stimulation outspreading auditory pathway certain tone ) The goal study perform double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial ( RCT ) 30 child . A three-arm study , one group receive propose treatment-music low tone two group receive placebo ( music without tone story ) perform . clinical non invasive laboratory measurement ( surface EMG ) relate spasticity , active passive range movement , isometric strength upper low body function would measure treatment .the assessment include also Visual assessment , evaluation gaze coordination quality life caretaker burden questionnaire .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A pilot study do year demonstrate significant improvement spasticity measure clinically non invasive surface EMG , four child hypertonic CP , expose music combine low frequency tone , via stereophonic headphone . Two child demonstrate prompt motor improvement also . The goal study perform double blind randomized placebo-controlled trial ( RCT ) ass preliminary result . participant : 30 child moderate severe hypertonic CP ( GMFCS 3-5 ) , age 3-9 year , `` Meshy '' `` Ilanot '' Early Childhood Development Centers â€“ Jerusalem , Israel , recruit parent informed consent . Children refuse put headphone include . A randomized control three-arm study , one group receive propose treatment-music low tone two group receive placebo ( music without tone story ) perform . The child listen music / story via stereophonic headphone 10 minute - 3 time week 4 week . Before start treatment child undergo : 1 . Neurological evaluation medical chart . 2 . Physiotherapic evaluation use GMFM assessment surface EMG 3 . Fine motor assessment use QUEST visual assessment . 4 . Parents complete PODCI Care Comfort questionnaire . We repeat EMG measurement immediately treatment . 3 month complete treatment repeat measurement do treatment .</detailed_description>
