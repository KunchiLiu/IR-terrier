	<detailed_description>Anemia identify common complication widespread problem cancer population . Anemia condition patient normal level hemoglobin , substance red blood cell carry oxygen part body . People severe anemia may experience fatigue shortness breath activity . Therefore , condition negative influence person 's quality life . Epoetin alfa , use treat anemia cancer patient , genetically engineer protein stimulates red blood cell production . This study investigate treatment anemia use epoetin alfa chemotherapy adult patient cancer . The study intend collect information normal medical practice routine anemia management perform participate center . This observational , non-randomized , prospective , comparative , parallel-group survey perform The Netherlands . Patients various severity disease may enter survey soon epoetin alfa treatment start follow end epoetin alfa treatment . Patient data collect Case Report Forms ( CRFs ) 4 week end treatment epoetin alfa . At end treatment complete CRFs collect . The assessment effectiveness/response base following : cancer type status , chemotherapy anti-cancer treatment , hemoglobin level , use blood transfusion , serum iron level iron supplementation . Safety evaluation include incidence serious non-serious adverse event . Because study observational , dosage , administration duration treatment discretion treat physician .</detailed_description>
