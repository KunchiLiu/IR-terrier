Cohorts 3 patient treated dos 50 mg administer either , twice three time day . In study maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define dose give without grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity 1/3 patient . If 2/3 patient cohort encounter grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity , additional 3 patient add . If dose intolerable &gt; 3/6 patient previous level declare MTD . Once MTD determine additional 10 patient add MTD good define expect toxicity .</detailed_description>
