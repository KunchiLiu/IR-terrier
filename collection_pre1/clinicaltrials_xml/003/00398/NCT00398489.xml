	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving chemotherapy without monoclonal antibody therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give docetaxel , epirubicin , cyclophosphamide without trastuzumab work treat woman locally advance breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel , Epirubicin , Cyclophosphamide With Without Trastuzumab Treating Women With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy neoadjuvant therapy comprise docetaxel trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) adjuvant therapy comprise epirubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) follow radiotherapy woman locally advance , HER2-positive , operable breast cancer . - Determine efficacy neoadjuvant therapy docetaxel adjuvant therapy comprise epirubicin hydrochloride cyclophosphamide follow radiotherapy woman locally advance , HER2-negative , operable breast cancer . OUTLINE : This open-label , prospective , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord HER2 status ( positive v negative ) . - Neoadjuvant therapy : - Stratum 1 ( HER2-positive disease ) : Patients receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 docetaxel IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity - Stratum 2 ( HER2-negative disease ) : Patients receive docetaxel IV alone stratum 1 . - Surgery : All patient undergo surgery week 19 . - Adjuvant therapy : Beginning within 2 week surgery , patient receive adjuvant therapy . - Stratum 1 ( HER2-positive disease ) : Patients receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , epirubicin hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 2 , cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute day 2 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive trastuzumab IV alone every 3 week week 52 . - Stratum 2 ( HER2-negative disease ) : Patients receive epirubicin hydrochloride cyclophosphamide stratum 1 . - Radiotherapy : Patients undergo breast conserve surgery patient undergo mastectomy ypN positive lymph node ( i.e. , &gt; 4 positive lymph node ) ypT3 tumor ( i.e. , tumor size &gt; 4 cm ) undergo radiotherapy , begin approximately week 31 continue week 38 . - Adjuvant endocrine therapy : Patients estrogen receptor- progesterone receptor-positive disease receive adjuvant endocrine therapy begin approximately week 31 . Premenopausal patient ≤ 40 year age receive goserelin 2-3 year tamoxifen citrate 5 years.Premenopausal patient &gt; 40 year age receive tamoxifen citrate 5 year . Postmenopausal patient receive anastrozole 5 year year . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 94 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
