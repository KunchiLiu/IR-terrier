	<brief_title>Phase I Study Perifosine + Sorafenib Patients With Advanced Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase I trial two part . In part 1 , MTD combination perifosine sorafenib determine . The experience perifosine biologic agent dos determine Phase I study well tolerate large group patient response endpoint . Thus part 2 , MTD start point , group patient accrue goal ensure able tolerate least three course therapy , would make evaluable response Phase II study . The effect combination perifosine sorafenib evaluate response rate time progression . The pharmacokinetics combination study drug measure . For purpose study , one cycle therapy define 4 week . Patients take perifosine one three time day also receive sorafenib one two time day . Patients may need anti-emetics and/or anti-diarrheals . - Patients experience toxicity may continue treatment dos delay reduce . - All patient continue therapy unless disease progression document two occasion four week apart All patient evaluate visit adverse event . Patients keep diary document compliance study drug , toxicity symptoms hand/foot syndrome include numbness , tingle , redness presence sore , symptom hypertension . Patients evaluate progression response 12-week interval .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis renal hepatocellular tumor eligible protocol . Patients solid tumor type must case review medical monitor . The physician must believe patient 's course growth rate tumor patient would feel comfortable continue treatment 12 week even transient period modest tumor growth first week follow initiation perifosine sorafenib treatment . Patients must life expectancy 6 month . Patients may receive prior sorafenib sunitinib malate . Patients may measurable evaluable disease . Patients performance status 0 1 accord ECOG criterion . Patients must adequate organ marrow function , unless opinion treat investigator , abnormality relate tumor medical monitor agree abnormality unlikely affect safety perifosine use . Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy include surgery radiotherapy , exclude alopecia . Patients breast cancer prostate cancer discontinue endocrine therapy prior entry onto study must wait minimum 1 month reassess withdrawal response prior start perifosine . However , requirement endocrine therapy discontinue . Patients must able ingest oral medication obtain gastrostomy tube . Patients must least 18 year age . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Rapidly progress disease , define progression within 12 week initiation previous regimen ( see Section 8.2.8 ) Patients three prior systemic therapy , include biologics , exclude unless prior approval obtain medical monitor . Patients receive investigational agent device Patients initiate treatment cancer within last two month continue concomitantly perifosine History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition perifosine ( miltefosine edelfosine ) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction perifosine .
