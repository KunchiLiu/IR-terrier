	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether new blood test ( procalcitonin ) help reduce unnecessary use antibiotic patient unexplained fever . Although fever commonly cause bacterial infection multiple condition cause fever . It cause viral infection . It also cause non infectious disease . Patients malignancy , inflammation ( gout arthritis ) , clots vein present fever . Occasionally medication cause fever . If fever cause infection antibiotic help . Instead may cause side effect diarrhea allergic reaction . We want determine whether simple blood test ( procalcitonin ) help u make difference fever cause infection fever cause others ( mention ) non-infectious problem . We also want determine whether test would help u reduce unnecessary antibiotic use help u find fast real cause fever . A total 90 patient unexplained fever participate study . This study involve single , additional blood test , perform patient continue fever despite day investigation therapy antibiotic . Patients assign draw one two group . In first group blood test ( procalcitonin ) help doctor decide whether stop continue antibiotic . If procalcitonin level high antibiotic continue doctor probably order additional test determine source infection . If procalcitonin level low serious bacterial infection unlikely . The antibiotic stop doctor try look cause fever . In second group blood test collect reported doctor . You treat traditional manner doctor . By follow procedure able determine whether therapy guide procalcitonin level safe possibly effective traditional approach . This study involve test study medication . We attempt contact patient one month later phone determine whether remain well discharge .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Antimicrobial resistance increasingly become threat patient safety health care settings.1 Several study identify inappropriate use antimicrobial important risk factor antimicrobial resistance important area opportunity increase patient safety improve patient outcomes.2 High rate antimicrobial use link high rate antimicrobial resistance,3 increase exposure antimicrobial associate increased probability colonization resistant pathogen . It also show antimicrobial control result significant cost savings4 may reduce antimicrobial resistance Surveys reveal 25 - 33 % hospitalized patient receive antibiotics6 22 - 65 % antibiotic use hospitalize patient inappropriate.7 Reasons inappropriate antimicrobial therapy include : 1. treat anybody fever ( even cause infection ) broad spectrum antibiotic 2. treat colonization contamination ( rather real infection ) 3. continue antibiotic even infection cure unlikely8 It quite clear clinician need reliable marker bacterial infection would allow early diagnosis , inform course prognosis disease facilitate therapeutic decisions.9 Procalcitonin cover feature well compare , commonly use biomarkers ( CRP ) .10 It show recently procalcitonin guidance substantially reduce antibiotic use community-acquired pneumonia without compromise patient ' safety . 11 , 12 However , efficacy safety PGAD hospitalize patient undefined fever previously investigate . We think PGAD equally safe effective intervention hospitalize patient fever unknown etiology . It help reduce inappropriate antibiotic use effect , help control antimicrobial resistance .</detailed_description>
