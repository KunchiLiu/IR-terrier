	<brief_summary>This exploratory phase 2 , randomize placebo-controlled trial stratification disease chemotherapy type . The study subsequently close enrollment arm except patient metastatic colorectal cancer would randomize either capecitabine plus perifosine capecitabine alone . The effect perifosine may manifest increased time progression , tumor regression reflect partial complete response , combination outcome . The primary goal trial obtain preliminary objective assessment effect perifosine time progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Placebo-Controlled Study Perifosine + Single Agent Chemotherapy Metastatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory phase 2 , randomize placebo-controlled trial stratification disease chemotherapy type . If evidence improve time progression tumor type drug evaluate , initial study component ( ) study expand increase certainty effect perifosine . If compelling evidence benefit study , phase 3 trial conduct obtain proof principle . Primary Study Objectives : To determine time tumor progression receive single agent chemotherapy ( capecitabine ) combination perifosine comparison patient receive single agent chemotherapy ( capecitabine ) alone ( i.e. , placebo ) . Secondary Study Objectives : - To determine toxicity single agent chemotherapy combination perifosine . - To compare time progression chemotherapy combination placebo historical experience . - Overall survival also evaluate .</detailed_description>
