	<brief_title>Randomized Study Decitabine Maintenance Therapy Acute Myeloid Leukemia ( AML )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methylation change occur DNA effect gene use human cell . It common leukemias methylation happen abnormally . Decitabine new drug block DNA methylation . At low dos ( use study ) , decitabine block proteins important abnormal DNA methylation , may , turn , allow leukemia cell die disappear . If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 2 group . Group 1 receive decitabine every 4-8 week see whether drug useful lengthen duration remission patient like . Group 2 receive study drug . If assign Group 1 , drug give 1 hour peripheral central catheter every day 5 day .

You also bone marrow examination aspirate/biopsy every 3-6 month make sure disease remain remission . If assign Group 2 , continue care doctor . This include study visit bone marrow examination aspirate/biopsy every 3-6 month one year randomization make sure disease remain remission . Once study , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw bone marrow biopsy/aspirate . This investigational study . Decitabine FDA-approved commercially available . It FDA approve usage , authorize use research .
