	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : lipoic acid supplement take orally improve control blood sugar level people type 2 diabetes . This study recruit 18 people type 2 diabetes , whose diabetes currently manage oral agent . Each subject either take placebo 12 week follow lipoic acid 12 week , lipoic acid follow placebo . A blood test overall diabetes control take start end 12 week period , change control compare lipoic acid v placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Lipoic Acid Glycaemic Control Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled crossover trial lipoic acid glycaemic control type 2 diabetes . The trial 3 phase , last 12 week . During phase 1 3 , subject take lipoic acid placebo tablet , order determine randomization . Phase 2 12-week washout period . The intervention lipoic acid 200mg daily 1 week , 400mg daily second week , 600mg daily week 3-12 . Equivalent number placebo tablet take placebo phase . The principal outcome measure change HbA1c start end lipoic acid supplementation , comparison change placebo . The secondary outcome measure change urine albumin : creatinine ratio period . Assessments safety include standard adverse event reporting , repeat laboratory measurement throughout study ( blood count , renal liver function ) hypoglycaemia frequency .</detailed_description>
