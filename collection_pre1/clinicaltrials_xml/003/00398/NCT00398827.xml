	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Dexmedetomidine Patients Requiring Sedation During Monitored Anesthesia Care ( MAC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Monitored anesthesia care ( MAC ) specific anesthesia service involve anesthesiologist administer sedative analgesic patient monitoring his/her vital sign . MAC often use supplement local regional anesthesia non-intubated patient undergo non-invasive procedure minor surgery . The goal MAC relieve anxiety induce minimally depress level consciousness patient able continuously independently maintain patent airway respond appropriately verbal command . Respiratory depression major concern medication ( midazolam , fentanyl , propofol ) currently use MAC . There clearly unmet need sedative agent safely use MAC healthy high risk population limit adverse side effect . A medication attenuate anxiety stress response associate surgery procedure without cause respiratory depression highly desirable . A medication reduce total amount opioids administer procedure could substantially reduce complication . Such medication could use either alone combination agent , thereby reduce dose side effect agent . Dexmedetomidine ( DEX ) sympatholytic , sedative , analgesic , anxiolytic effect attenuate catecholamine response perioperative stress . DEX associate respiratory depression use alone , despite sometimes deep level sedation . An estimated 325 patient ( 260 DEX , 65 PBO ) require MAC sedation elective surgery/procedure randomize approximately 25 investigative site .</detailed_description>
