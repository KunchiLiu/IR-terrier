	<brief_title>A Study Efficacy ( Effectiveness ) , Safety , Impact Quality Life Measures Dilaudid CR ( Controlled Release ) ; , Hydromorphone HCl Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study short-term , non-randomized ( patient assign treatment phase I phase III researcher ) , non-comparative , open-label , repeat dose study OROS® hydromorphone HCL consist 3 phase : Phase 1 - prior opioid stabilization phase ( 2-7 day ) ; Phase 2 - OROS® hydromorphone HCL conversion , titration , stabilization phase ( 3 - 14 day ) ; Phase 3 - OROS® hydromorphone HCL maintenance therapy phase ( 28 day ) Before Phase 1 , patient must change prescribed opioid regimen prior 30 day . During Phase 1 , patient demonstrate 2 consecutive day stable baseline oral transdermal opioid medication . During Phase 2 , patient require =96 mg OROS® hydromorphone HCL every 24 hour convert once-daily dose OROS® hydromorphone HCL dose approximately 5:1 morphine hydromorphone equivalent ratio . OROS® hydromorphone HCL dose titration ( 25-100 % baseline dose ) allow every 2 day achieve stabilization . OROS® hydromorphone HCL dose reduction allow Phases 2 3 opioid-related adverse event ( AEs ) . Rescue medication , Dilaudid IR ( immediate release ) allow 3 phase . During Phase 3 , patient attend 4 weekly study visit provide diary information study medication rescue medication usage , daily pain relief score adverse event , receive weekly supply study medication . OROS® hydromorphone HCL tablets 8,16 , 32 , 64 mg depend Phase I stable baseline oral transdermal opioid medication , 2-7 day ; study drug dose titration allow every 2 day achieve stabilization Phase II , 3-14 day ; Phase III , maintenance therapy phase 28 day ; study drug dose reduction allow Phase 2 3 opioid-related adverse event . Rescue medication Dilaudid IR ( immediate release ) 2 , 4 , 8mg tablet allow phase .</detailed_description>
