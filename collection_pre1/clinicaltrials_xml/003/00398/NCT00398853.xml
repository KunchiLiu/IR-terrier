	<brief_title>Effect Chromium Picolinate Insulin Sensitivity Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : The primary clinical strategy improve metabolic control patient Type 2 diabetes consist lifestyle modification combine pharmacologic intervention . However , alternative strategy , e.g . nutritional supplementation over-the-counter agent , extensively practice large number patient frequently undertake without first inform medical provider . Unfortunately , considerable controversy exists regard use dietary supplement subject diabetes efficacy data many supplement consist uncontrolled study anecdotal report . As , paucity data human regard effect commercially available supplement improve metabolic abnormality . One supplement attract considerable clinical interest chromium ( Cr ) . However , routine use Cr subject diabetes currently recommend . In part , controversy surround Cr supplementation stem lack definitive randomize trial , lack `` gold standard '' technique assess glucose metabolism study report , use differing dos formulation , study heterogeneous study population . As , conflict data report contribute greatly confusion among healthcare provider concern Cr supplementation . In order provide comprehensive clinical evaluation Cr , conduct randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial subject Type 2 diabetes . Individuals baseline measure consist oral glucose tolerance testing , body fat adiposity assess , use establish technique ass insulin sensitivity hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp . Individuals evaluate 6 month time repeat test do .</detailed_description>
