	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Diagnostic procedure , ultrasound-guided biopsy , may help find prostate cancer . Dutasteride may improve ability ultrasound-guided biopsy find prostate cancer . It yet know whether dutasteride follow ultrasound-guided biopsy effective placebo follow ultrasound-guided biopsy find prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study dutasteride ultrasound-guided biopsy see well find prostate cancer compare placebo ultrasound-guided biopsy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy dutasteride follow contrast-enhanced , ultrasound-guided target biopsy detect prostate cancer . - Determine detection rate prostate cancer target biopsy use contrast-enhanced ultrasound combine dutasteride . - Determine efficacy target biopsy use contrast-enhanced ultrasound v systematic biopsy diagnose clinically significant prostate cancer . - Determine reduction post-biopsy bleed dutasteride patient . - Determine cost effectiveness regimen patient . OUTLINE : This prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize study . Patients randomize 1 2 arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral dutasteride daily day 1-14 . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo daily day 1-14 . On day 14 , patient arm undergo blood collection contrast-enhanced ( perflutren protein-type A microspheres ) transrectal ultrasound . Conventional gray-scale imaging , color Doppler imaging , power Doppler imaging perform . Biopsies perform ; first 6 targeted ultrasound-guided biopsy 12 systematic biopsy . After completion study procedure , patient follow 1 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 450 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
