	<brief_summary>Impaired short term memory , attention concentration lapse , slow process information occur 40-65 % patient Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . The quality life individual MS impact degree experience symptom . There several medication approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat MS symptom modify ( slow ) disease course . Traditional approach determine effectiveness medication use treat MS rely report number relapse individual experience , well standard clinical test , Kurtzke Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) . This research study look whether functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan use tool measure change brain associate treatment MS patient . Unlike typical MRI provide structural information brain , fMRI provide information brain activity performance cognitive motor task .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An fMRI Study Treatment Optimization Comparing Two Disease Modifying Therapies Used Treat Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development immunomodulatory , disease-modifying therapy ( DMT ) represent major advance treatment multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . To date , immunomodulatory agent approve treatment MS United States include two form recombinant interferon-beta ( IFN-beta-1a [ Avonex , Rebif ] IFN-beta-1b [ Betaseron ] ) synthetic glatiramer acetate [ Copaxone ] . These drug show favorably alter natural history relapse remit MS slow progression disability , reduce relapse rate , decrease brain inflammation measure MRI . There evidence treatment effect IFN-beta glatiramer acetate relate property regulate various component immune system , particular , T cell function ( e.g . proliferation migratory behavior ) cytokine production . Though demonstrate clear efficacy number short-term clinical measure , agent cure patient MS continue experience disease activity spite treatment . Over last ten year , clinicians become comfortable initiating therapy DMT . Now , attention focus monitoring result choose therapy decide whether patient respond optimally treatment . At present , however , clinician lack criterion define optimal response DMT well evidence-based recommendation improve treatment outcome individual patient . Using recently publish model generate advisory board United States , framework , The Canadian Multiple Sclerosis Working Group ( CMSWG ) develop practical , evidence-based recommendation neurologist assess status patient DMT decide may necessary modify treatment order optimize outcome . The CMSWG 's recommendation base monitoring relapse , neurological progression MRI activity . These recommendation yet implement prospective , randomize , comparative Phase IV clinical trial . Traditional measure provide critical information neural system underlie change behavioral performance . The goal develop surrogate biological marker drug efficacy able measure extent drug reach intend target neural system , understand predict impact treatment exist neuropathology . Ideally , relevant clinical outcome measure well correlate biomarker . fMRI new tool noninvasive imaging human brain function . Without use contrast agent , fMRI detects regional MR signal increase hypothesize reflect decrease deoxyhemoglobin due local increase blood flow/volume task activation . fMRI high spatial temporal resolution exist functional imaging technique , make ideal study complex cognitive function patient population .</detailed_description>
