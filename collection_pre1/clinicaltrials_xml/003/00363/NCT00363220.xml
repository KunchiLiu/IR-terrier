	<brief_summary>The purpose study review patient E. coli infection University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC ) September 1 , 2006 August 31 , 2007 determine infection arise community rather hospital nurse home . The occurrence resistant isolates could devastate associated bloodstream infection , sometimes accompany urinary tract infection , since antibiotic resistant E. coli suspect isolates come community . Therefore , aim study : 1. Review whether extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ( ESBL ) -producing organism ( E. coli , Klebsiella species Proteus specie ) hospital-acquired , healthcare-associated , community-associated . 2 . Investigate prevalence ESBL-positive E. coli foodstuff ( beef , poultry , turkey , pork ) , potential source ESBL producer community . 3 . Compare clonal relationship genome resistance plasmid carry ESBL-producing isolates ( healthcare-associated , community-associated , animal origin ) study association ESBL-mediated resistance resistance class antimicrobial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The following variable follow : age , sex , occupation , hospital location time positive culture ( ER , medical ward , ICU , etc . ) , prior hospitalization nursing home admission , receipt outpatient dialysis , home care regular medical care ( eg , outpatient chemotherapy ) , presence invasive device , receipt antibiotic , include type whether adequate resistance profile organism , prior positive microbiologic culture . All site collect follow information collect part patient 's clinical treatment . The following variable collect site : time location positive culture , underlie disease severity illness , presence urinary intravascular device , recent immunomodulative therapy radiation therapy , physical exam finding , laboratory radiographical data , antimicrobial usage within 30 day onset infection , microbiological data resistance pattern , choice antibiotic organism identify , bacteriological outcome , laboratory result , demographic information , medication , clinical outcome , gender , height , weight , ethnicity , past medical history . We collect information prospectively one year . The bacteria patient 's culture subcultured ( diagnosis obtain since microbiology lab would otherwise destroy culture ) provide honest broker de-identify specimen link medical information collect ( also de-identified honest broker ) . The following evaluation perform sample . The minimal inhibitory concentration antibiotic use treatment perform E-Test method ( AB Biodisk , Solna , Sweden ) . Specific mechanisms antimicrobial resistance study emphasis presence beta-lactamase produce bacteria . This evaluation perform analytical isoelectric focus technique well PCR gene sequence analysis determine gene encode beta-lactamase . Biologic sample control principal investigator research project . All sample provide investigator de-identified honest broker cod number . The information link code number correspond subject ' identity keep separate , secure location honest broker access . The investigator study keep sample indefinitely . Samples keep investigator 's laboratory locate Scaife Hall , room 812 , 3500 Terrace Street . At time research investigator access patient identifier . Medical record information bacteria sample facility outside UPMC provide PI de-identified . At time anyone research team access patient identifier . All information bacteria collect part patient 's clinical treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient E. coli , Klebsiella specie , Proteus species infection time period study review . A communityassociated E. coli isolate define one recovered clinical culture patient UPMC establish risk factor infection antibiotic resistant organism . Established risk factor define : Isolation organism two day admission hospitalization OR History hospitalization , surgery , dialysis , residence longterm care facility within one year culture date OR The presence indwell catheter percutaneous medical device ( eg , tracheostomy tube , gastrostomy tube , Foley catheter ) time culture OR Previous isolation antibiotic resistant organism .</criteria>
