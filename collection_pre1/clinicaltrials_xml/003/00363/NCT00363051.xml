	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess efficacy safety everolimus treatment advance pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) responsive cytotoxic chemotherapy . All patient treat everolimus either tumor progression document use standard criterion measure tumor size call Response Evaluation Criteria Solid tumor ( RECIST ) , unacceptable toxicity occur , patient investigator request discontinuation treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This stratify two-stage , single-arm , phase 2 study treatment everolimus patient advance ( unresectable metastatic ) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor ( NET ) failure cytotoxic chemotherapy . Stratum 1 , consist patient receive chronic Octreotide Depot therapy , receive everolimus monotherapy 10 mg/day . Stratum 2 , consist patient tumor progress Octreotide Depot treatment continue entry dose Octreotide Depot plus everolimus 10 mg/day .</detailed_description>
