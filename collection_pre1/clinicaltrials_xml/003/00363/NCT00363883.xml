	<brief_title>Vorinostat Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Metastatic Cancer Urothelium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate measure RECIST criterion SAHA patient recurrent metastatic transitional cell carcinoma urothelium . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time progression overall survival SAHA patient recurrent metastatic transitional cell carcinoma urothelium . II . To provide data safety toxicity SAHA patient recurrent metastatic transitional cell carcinoma urothelium . III . To obtain preliminary data molecular correlate tissue , oral mucosa blood determine feasibility clinical efficacy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral vorinostat ( SAHA ) twice daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood buccal mucosa collection tumor biopsy ( accessible ) baseline periodically study correlative study . Samples examine gene expression profile immunohistochemistry . After completion study treatment , patient follow 26 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 37 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
