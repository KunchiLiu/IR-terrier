	<brief_title>Ispinesib Treating Young Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose ispinesib pediatric patient refractory solid tumor lymphoma . II . Define describe toxicity ispinesib patient . III . Characterize pharmacokinetics ispinesib patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Define , preliminarily , antitumor activity ispinesib . II . Determine relationship CYP3A4 gene polymorphism pharmacokinetics patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive ispinesib IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos ispinesib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Patients undergo blood tumor sample collection periodically pharmacokinetic gene polymorphism correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
