	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Studying immune response vaccine make HER2/neu protein may help doctor plan good treatment patient breast cancer overexpresses HER2 . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study immune response patient undergone vaccine therapy stage III stage IV breast cancer overexpresses HER2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Response Patients Who Have Undergone Vaccine Therapy Stage III Stage IV Breast Cancer That Overexpresses HER2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether immunologic memory HER-2/neu ( HER2 ) intracellular domain ( ICD ) protein generate active immunization HER2 ICD plasmid-based vaccine assess delayed-type hypersensitivity response HER2 ICD peptides 6 month vaccination patient HER2-overexpressing stage III IV breast cancer . Secondary - Characterize memory T-cell population quantitate memory precursor frequency 3 , 6 , 12 month active immunization use intracellular cytokine staining . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive HER2 intracellular domain ( ICD ) protein mixture intradermally sterile water inject intradermally ( negative control ) 6 month post-vaccination pNGVL3-hICD vaccine . Vital sign injection site monitor prior skin test 60 minute post-test . Patients return 48-72 hour skin test delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) measurement . The injection site biopsied examined immunohistochemistry infiltrate T-cell antigen-presenting cell population . Blood drawn 3 , 6 , 12 month post-vaccination assessment immune memory response . Blood draw coordinate parent study . Blood sample examine flow cytometry presence memory marker include L-selectin , CD45 isoforms , cytokine , CCR7 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 56 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
