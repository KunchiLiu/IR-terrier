	<brief_title>Green Tea Polyphenon E Preventing Lung Cancer Former Smokers With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate effect high-level oral consumption define green tea ( four 12-oz servings/day ) polyphenon E capsule ( 4 capsules/day ) marker cellular oxidative damage , measure 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) 8-F_2-isoprostanes ( 8-epi-PGF2 ) former smoker chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Secondary - Evaluate effect high-level oral consumption define green tea polyphenon E capsule body antioxidant status ( carotenoid , vitamins A E , ascorbic acid [ vitamin C ] antioxidant enzyme [ catalase glutathione peroxidase ] ) blood patient . - Evaluate effect high-level oral consumption define green tea polyphenon E capsule gene expression marker proliferation apoptosis induce sputum patient . Tertiary - Evaluate effect high-level oral consumption define green tea polyphenon E capsule lung function patient . - Evaluate relative adherence use green tea beverage v polyphenon E capsule patient . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratify accord gender inhale steroid usage ( yes v ) . All patient receive placebo tea beverage placebo capsule 4 time day 2 week . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm successful completion 2-week period . - Arm I ( green tea beverage ) : Patients receive oral green tea beverage oral polyphenon E placebo daily 6 month . - Arm II ( green tea capsule [ polyphenon E ] ) : Patients receive oral green tea beverage placebo oral polyphenon E daily 6 month . - Arm III ( placebo ) : Patients receive oral green tea beverage placebo oral polyphenon E placebo daily 6 month . Patients undergo blood , urine , exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) , induced sputum , buccal cell collection baseline periodically study biomarker/laboratory analysis . Blood sample analyze 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine ( 8-OHdG ) , glutathione peroxidase , catalase . Urine examine F_2-isoprostanes , 8-OHdG , tea polyphenols . Induced sputum broncho-epithelial cell analyze gene expression gene implicate cellular growth apoptotic pathway via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction . EBC sample examine F_2-isoprostane level . Buccal cell store future analysis . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 195 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
