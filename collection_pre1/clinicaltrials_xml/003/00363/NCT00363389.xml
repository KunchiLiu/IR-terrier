	<detailed_description>In gynaecological practice , diagnostic therapeutic hysteroscopy one common method diagnose intrauterine pathology . The complication encounter hysteroscopy , cervical tear , creation false passage , uterine perforation , mainly relate difficulty cervical dilatation nulliparous postmenopausal patient . GnRH agonist use , previous cone biopsy , markedly retrovert uterus additional risk factor complication . Cervical ripening may achieve either mechanical mean , osmotic dilator , biochemically prostaglandins . Solid evidence support efficacy misoprostol cervical ripen first-trimester suction curettage abortion . A consensus emerge optimal treatment regimen use 400-μg misoprostol 3-4 hour pre-operatively , vaginal administration superior oral administration . However , two study use 400-μg misoprostol via oral vaginal route previously show result satisfactory pre-operative dilatation majority Norwegian woman , recommend minimum dosage great 400-μg vaginal misoprostol four hour pre-operatively . The first trial describe prostaglandin prim cervix reduce frequency traumatic cervical uterine lesion non-pregnant woman prior hysteroscopy publish 1985 . Misoprostol cervical prim non-pregnant woman well establish . 16 publish randomise control trial show different cervical response outcome . Most study separately , systematically compare effect different patient group , nulliparous woman postmenopausal woman . Seven study include less 50 patient , almost trial underpowered regard evaluate primary outcome measure . In study large number patient include ( Thomas et al ) , author explain converted primary outcome measure `` largest-number Hegar dilator could insert without resistance '' binary variable ( `` Hegar &gt; 8/Hegar &lt; 8 ) analyse result - apparent protocol violation . It appear none trial design conducted accordance CONSORT statement . The dosage use study vary 200 1000-μg misoprostol give 2 24 hour hysteroscopy , via oral , sublingual vaginal route . Trials use high dosage misoprostol , via vaginal route , use long interval administration misoprostol hysteroscopy tend show favourable outcome regard cervical priming . The hospital pharmacist manufacture active misoprostol ground whitish powder capsule ( 500-μg per capsule ) , well inactive ingredient identical appearance ( lactose ) capsule placebo . The hospital pharmacist prepare number , opaque , seal envelope . The envelope number accord randomisation list . The hospital pharmacy insert prepare capsule envelope . Each envelope contain two capsule . Half envelop contain two capsule 500-μg misoprostol , half contain two placebo capsule . All patient refer outpatient hysteroscopy Ullevål University hospital send invitation include study , together date prior patient consultation hysteroscopy . The study invitation include detailed information regard study , well informed consent form . The patient consultation take place day prior schedule hysteroscopy , give option participate study . The study author primarily responsible recruiting patient . During study period , participant flow record . If patient recruit , gynaecologist pre-operative consultation record pre-operative variable case report form , patient give envelope contain capsule leave hospital . Hence involve administer intervention assess outcome blind dosage , well patient . Each participant randomise opening number , seal , opaque envelope home , contain either misoprostol , inactive ingredient identical appearance , capsule . The design method randomization blind obviate potential subjectivity bias . The patient instruct insert capsule 9 p.m. evening operation . Before hysteroscopy , gynaecologist measure pre-operative degree cervical dilatation pass Hegar dilator cervix ascend order start size two millimetre . The size large dilator pass cervical o without subjective resistance felt operator record preoperative degree dilatation . If resistance Hegar dilator size two millimetre , result record &lt; 2 . Adverse event superficial cervical laceration , false passage cervix cervical dilatation , perforation uterus record . The patient record review 60 day see woman contact hospital post-operative complication . A two sample sequential Wilcoxon test use analyze data . We perform small pilot study department 20 patient prior hysteroscopy January 2006 investigate pre-operative variability ( SD ) cervical dilatation . The standard deviation 1.3 mm postmenopausal patient ( n=5 ) , 1.4 mm premenopausal patient ( n=15 ) . The mean cervical dilatation 3.4 mm postmenopausal patient 5.4 mm premenopausal patient . The design main trial base significance level 5 % power 95 % 1 mm difference cervical dilatation cause misoprostol placebo . As seem unlikely use misoprostol could cause constriction cervix , one-sided test chosen . The trial continue either null hypothesis alternative hypothesis refute .</detailed_description>
