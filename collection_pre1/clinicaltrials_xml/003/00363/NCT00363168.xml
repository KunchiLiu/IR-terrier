	<brief_summary>This research do look effect experimental drug , ranibizumab , condition call `` predominantly hemorrhagic subfoveal choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) '' due wet age-related macular degeneration . A predominantly hemorrhagic CNV lesion diagnose least 50 % choroidal neovascular lesion occupy blood retina . We want find injection ranibizumab eye help patient condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ranibizumab Hemorrhagic Choroidal Neovascularization Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , interventional case series . A total 10 patient , see Retina Division Wilmer Eye Institute , enrol . Subjects randomize either 0.3 mg 0.5 mg intravitreal injection ranibizumab , perform monthly 3 dos . Further monthly injection discretion examiner , may withhold lack continued improvement ( defined lack improvement least 5 letter eye chart compare 2 previous consecutive visit lack decrease retinal center point thickness least 50 micron compare 2 previous consecutive visit ) complete success ( define visual acuity 20/20 good retinal center point thickness &lt; 225 micron ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible follow criterion meet : Ability provide write informed consent comply study assessment full duration study . Predominantly hemorrhagic subfoveal CNV ( least 50 % lesion compose hemorrhage ) agerelated macular degeneration ( AMD ) result visual acuity 20/40 worse . Age great 50 year . Participant must medium clear enough permit fundus photography , fluorescein angiography , optical coherence tomography . Subjects meet follow criterion exclude study : Known hypersensitivity humanize monoclonal antibody History ( within past 6 month ) evidence severe cardiac disease ( apparent electrocardiogram abnormality , clinical history unstable angina , acute coronary syndrome , myocardial infarction , revascularization procedure within 6 month prior baseline , atrial ventricular tachyarrhythmias require ongoing treatment ) . History stroke within 6 month study entry . Current acute ocular periocular infection . Any major surgical procedure within one month study entry . Known serious allergy fluorescein dye . Previous participation clinical trial ( either eye ) involve antiangiogenic drug ( pegaptanib , ranibizumab , anecortave acetate , Protein Kinase C inhibitor , etc ) within last 6 month . Previous intravitreal drug delivery ( e.g. , intravitreal corticosteroid injection device implantation ) study eye within last 6 month . History subfoveal laser treatment study eye . History visuallylimiting condition optic neuropathy , amblyopia , choroidal neovascularization due cause AMD study eye . Ocular inflammation ( include trace ) study eye . Inability comply study follow procedure .</criteria>
