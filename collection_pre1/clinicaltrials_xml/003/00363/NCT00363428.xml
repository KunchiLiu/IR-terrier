	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Exercise may help improve lung function lessen complication surgery patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergo surgery lung cancer . It yet know whether lung rehabilitation effective standard therapy improve lung function patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergo surgery lung cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study lung rehabilitation see well work compare standard therapy treat patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergo surgery lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Rehabilitation Treating Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Who Are Undergoing Surgery Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare impact preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation ( include upper low extremity resistance training ) v usual care patient lung cancer moderate severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease require lung resection lung cancer . - Compare impact study intervention v usual care functional status surgery . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 intervention arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo pulmonary rehabilitation ( include daily upper low extremity resistance training , education , smoke cessation counseling ) twice day 5 day prior surgical resection . Beginning 2-3days surgery , patient undergo pulmonary rehabilitation day discharge hospital . - Arm II : Patients receive usual care ( education smoke cessation counsel alone ) twice day 5 day prior surgical resection . Following surgery , patient receive usual care day discharge hospital . Days hospitalization , ICU admission , postoperative complication ( i.e. , pneumonia , mechanical ventilation &gt; 48 hour , atelectasis require bronchoscopy ) spirometry image study evaluate surgery . After completion study intervention , patient follow 4-6 week , 12 week , 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 90 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
