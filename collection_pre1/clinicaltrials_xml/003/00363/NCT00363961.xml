	<brief_summary>There rise incidence kidney failure US , poor outcomes high cost . End-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) affect almost 375,000 individual US cost $ 14 billion per year . Despite advance dialysis transplantation therapy , kidney failure lead poor outcome , poor prognosis high health care cost . Malnutrition underlie systemic inflammatory response develop course chronic kidney disease , worsen ESRD , lead adverse outcome , increase morbidity mortality . Muscle wasting , impaired functional capacity poor quality life important factor associate malnutrition inflammation renal failure . We show pre dialysis patient moderate chronic renal insufficiency anabolic effect resistance exercise training result significant improvement protein utilization , nutritional status functional capacity even context anorexia prescribe low protein diet . Therefore , propose develop , test implement progressive resistance exercise routine ESRD patient hemodialysis session . By implement intervention , hope offer therapeutic strategy incorporate standard care ESRD patient work conjunction dialysis unit staff .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis investigate , compare ESRD patient maintenance dialysis receive stretch , addition 30-45 min progressive resistance training hemodialysis session counteract burden renal disease result : 1 . A feasible safe exercise modality ESRD patient . 2 . Will contribute improved nutritional status reduce systemic inflammation 3 . Will result improved quality life</detailed_description>
