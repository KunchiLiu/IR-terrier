	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) autosomal recessive disorder cause mutation CF trans-membrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) protein . CF common inherit disease Caucasians , carrier frequency 1 25-30 individual . Even impressive advance achieve understanding molecular basis physiopathology CF , remain life-threatening disorder cause severe lung damage nutritional deficiency . It generally accept early therapy could delay progression lung disease . A number non-invasive method available monitor disease activity CF patient ; however none currently use tool able monitor real-time event . Recently high resolution compute tomography ( HRCT ) use monitor change lung structure . However , HRCT allow differentiate acute chronic lesion . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) 18fluoro-deoxy-glucose ( FDG ) already use variety setting visualize inflammation infection . FDG-PET imaging appear promise new tool quantify inflammation detect clinically relevant change even change minimal one detect morphologic imaging . PET/CT may consequently use evaluate severity lung inflammation/infection CF patient , therefore aim study evaluate use PET/CT assessment severity lung inflammation/ infection CF patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis patient active lung disease undergo high resolution PET-CT.PET/CT scan ( GE ST Discovery PET/CT scanner ) perform 60 90 minute injection 5 MBq/kg FDG . PET/CT repeat end treatment compare result initial scan . PET CT interpret certified nuclear medicine physician certify radiologist , respectively , blind clinical data , use PET severity score ( PSS ) , base number intensity FDG uptake lung focus . Intensity uptake determine calculate mean value maximum standardized uptake value ( MSUV ) focus . ( SUV = Activity concentration ROI ( region interest ) divide inject dose / patient body weight ) . SUV measure normal lung receive normal baseline control calculation . The correlation clinical data ( FEV1 % predict ) sputum bacteriology perform . Inflammation status also follow cytokine analysis .</detailed_description>
