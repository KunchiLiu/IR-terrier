	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving capecitabine surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . Sometimes , surgery , tumor may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . It yet know whether capecitabine effective observation treat biliary tract cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study capecitabine see well work compare observation treat patient biliary tract cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Observation After Surgery Treating Patients With Biliary Tract Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - To determine whether adjuvant chemotherapy capecitabine effect 2-year survival compare expectant treatment alone ( observation ) patient undergone macroscopically complete surgical resection biliary tract cancer . Secondary - To compare capecitabine versus observation term 5-year survival , relapse-free survival , toxicity , quality life , health economics . OUTLINE : This multicenter , prospective , randomize study . Patients stratify accord surgical center , disease site ( hilar/extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma v intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma v gallbladder v intrapancreatic/common bile duct ) , type resection ( R0 v R1 ) , ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 v 2 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral capecitabine twice day day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients undergo expectant treatment ( observation ) . Quality life assess baseline , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year . All patient follow 5 year post-randomization . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 360 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
