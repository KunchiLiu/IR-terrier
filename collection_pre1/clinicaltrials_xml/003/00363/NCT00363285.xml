	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Hormone therapy , cyproterone acetate may stop adrenal gland make androgen . Sometimes tumor may need treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . It yet know whether give cyproterone acetate continuously effective give cyproterone acetate tumor progression treat prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study cyproterone acetate compare well work give continuously tumor progression treat patient newly diagnose stage III stage IV prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cyproterone Acetate Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage III Stage IV Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare time loss androgen dependence , base serum prostate-specific antigen failure , patient newly diagnose stage III IV prostate cancer treat intermittent vs continuous androgen suppression comprise cyproterone acetate . - Compare time treatment failure ( subjective objective progression ) patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . - Compare survival patient treat regimen . Secondary - Compare side effect patient treat regimen . - Determine first total therapy-free interval patient treat intermittent cyproterone acetate . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . All patient receive cyproterone acetate daily 16 week . Patients also receive monthly injection luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone ( LHRH ) agonist begin week 2 continue 14 week . Patients prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level ≤ 4 ng/mL asymptomatic 14 week randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I ( continuous maximum-androgen blockade ) : Patients receive cyproterone acetate daily monthly LHRH agonist depot injection absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may also undergo orchidectomy . Quality life assess every 6 month 2 year annually thereafter . - Arm II ( intermittent treatment ) : Patients observed randomization . Treatment daily cyproterone acetate resume symptoms demand hormone treatment patient PSA level OR patient asymptomatic PSA level ≥ 20 ng/mL . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . If 9 month treatment , PSA level ≤ 4 ng/mL achieve patient remain symptomatic , treatment discontinue . Quality life assess every 6 month therapy restart . Pain performance status assess visit treatment arm . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 900 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
