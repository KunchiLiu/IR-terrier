	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Tyrosine kinase inhibitor may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Interferon alfa may interfere growth cancer cell . GM-CSF may help cell involve body 's immune response work well . Vaccines make person 's cancer cell may help body build effective immune response kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study tyrosine kinase inhibitor , interferon alfa , GM-CSF see well work compare tyrosine kinase inhibitor vaccine therapy treating patient chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare clinical response , term 1-year progression-free survival rate molecular complete remission , patient Philadelphia chromosome-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia ( Ph+ CML ) chronic phase achieve complete cytogenetic remission single-agent tyrosine kinase inhibitor treat interferon alfa sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) v tyrosine kinase inhibitor GM-K562 cell vaccine . Secondary - Compare time Ph-negativity polymerase chain reaction randomization . - Compare disease-free survival percent molecular complete remission . - Determine toxicity treatment regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize , crossover , study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . The study modify base result plan interim analysis . Individual Study Arms continue accrue treat indicate analysis . The study current format continue plan interim analysis indicate Study Arms remain viable effective treatment . All patient continue receive standard dose tyrosine kinase inhibitor addition 1 follow treatment arm : - Arm I : Patients receive interferon alfa subcutaneously ( SC ) GM-CSF SC daily 6 month . Patients achieve molecular complete remission ( CR ) ( define BCR-ABL-negative disease confirm 2 PCR assay separate 1 month ) end 6-month period , discontinue study therapy monitor disease recurrence blood test every 4 week . Patients achieve molecular CR ( define BCR-ABL-positive disease ) completion initial 6 month therapy , receive additional 6 month therapy . Patients achieve BCR-ABL-negative disease additional 6 month therapy , discontinue study therapy monitor disease recurrence blood test every 4 week . Patients remain BCR-ABL-positive PCR additional 6 month therapy , eligible cross arm II . If time stop study therapy blood test show disease recurrence , patient restart tyrosine kinase inhibitor eligible cross arm II . Patients also eligible cross arm II presence unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II : Patients receive GM-K562 cell vaccine intradermally every 3 week minimum 6 month . Patients BCR-ABL-negative disease end 6-month period discontinue study therapy monitor disease recurrence blood test every 4 week . Patients BCR-ABL-positive disease completion initial 6 month therapy , receive additional 6 month therapy . Patients achieve BCR-ABL-negative disease additional 6 month therapy , discontinue study therapy monitor every 4 week disease recurrence . Patients remain BCR-ABL-positive additional 6 month therapy , eligible cross arm I . If time stop study therapy blood test show disease recurrence , patient restart tyrosine kinase inhibitor eligible cross arm I . Patients also eligible cross arm I presence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 1 year . As May 2014 , Study Arm B available newly accrue enrol subject base interim analysis direct new subject combination Interferon + GM-CSF . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 56 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
