	<brief_title>Characterizing Wheelchair-Related Falls Elderly Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Objectives . A multitude risk factor fall report , however many risk factor applicable person use wheelchair mobility . Specific objective include : ( 1 ) Describe incidence prevalence wheelchair tip ( near fall ) , fall , fall-related injury , ( 2 ) Describe epidemiology wheelchair tip fall event . ( 3 ) Create model predict wheelchair tip , fall , fall-related injury elderly person use wheelchair mobility . ( 4 ) Determine healthcare utilization direct cost associate wheelchair-related fall injury . ( 5 ) Describe patient perceive short- long-term consequence wheelchair-related fall . Research Design . This 3-year prospective cohort study include qualitative quantitative data collect baseline data monthly follow-up phone interview 12-month period . Data Source . Baseline data demographic , intrinsic risk factor , extrinsic risk factor collect interview . We assess functional status , cognition , home management skill standardized tool . Administrative database use gather data regard comorbidities , Veterans Health Administration ( VHA ) health care utilization direct cost . A physical therapy assistant also conduct wheelchair inventory wheelchair skills test . Monthly follow-up phone interview include number fall , description fall event/mechanism nature injury , change modifiable risk factor , description injury treatment . A separate phone interview conduct subset subject 6 month post fall , use open-ended question gather data patient-perceived long-term consequence fall . At end 12-month data collection , reassess patient 's functional status cognition . Sample . Inclusion criterion include veteran ( 1 ) age 62 old , ( 2 ) use wheelchair primary mean mobility , ( 3 ) use wheelchair least 12 month previous enrollment , ( 4 ) use wheelchair least next 12 month . Exclusion criterion ( 1 ) long live community-based setting ( e.g. , admitted nursing home ) , ( 2 ) telephone . We sample woman minority . A total 882 subject need power 0.8 alpha 0.05 anticipate drop rate 30 % . Analysis . Bivariate analysis perform determine relationship outcomes risk factor . Logistic regression model predict wheelchair-related tip , fall fall-related injury develop base important intrinsic extrinsic risk factor , control possible confounders . Falls also analyze accord survival-analysis technique . Univariate multiple Cox regression use assess association different independent variable injurious fall . The cost analysis estimate net marginal cost wheelchair user experience wheelchair fall accident seek medical advice treatment . We use dichotomous fall ( generate medical expense ) variable `` '' `` without '' analysis compare average cost medical care wheelchair user without fall involve medical observation care average cost serious fall ( include death ) . The difference two group proxy cost utilization due fall . Multivariate regression analysis use gauge net effect fall cost , control wider array factor drive cost treatment thereby potentially confound univariate analysis . The control variables demographic include co-morbid condition healthcare relate . Anticipated Impact . Our project expect identify previously unaccounted factor predispose person use wheelchair fall fall-related injury . We create model predict wheelchair tip , fall , fall-related injury . These model use develop evidence-based , patient center wheelchair fall prevention program target modifiable risk factor . Findings study use develop instrument identify fall risk elderly wheelchair user well evidenced-based prevention program . We partner VA National Center Patient Safety disseminate product nationally VHA .</detailed_description>
