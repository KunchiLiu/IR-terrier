	<brief_summary>Current expert opinion base consensus guideline recommend usage α-Keto analogue essential amino acid diet diabetic nephropathy patient , along restrict protein diet . This study design explore whether alpha-Keto Acid supplementation low protein diet retard progression type 2 diabetic nephropathy also assess effect supplement diet nutritional parameter patient group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetic nephropathy common cause end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) Europe America , directly relate rise incidence type 2 diabetes . In addition , life lengthen diabetic patient ESRD patient receive regular therapy also important cause . According data year 1977 , 40 % newly diagnose ESRD patient USA cause diabetes . Duo enormous number incessant increase incidence type 2 diabetic patient , type 2 diabetic nephropathy patient already account considerable proportion diabetic nephropathy patient need dialysis . Recently China incidence type 2 diabetes show tendency escalate . It expect number diabetic patient 32 million 2010. α-Keto Acid product amino acid deamination . Because nonnitrogenous accept amino turn correspond amino acid transaminase body patient chronic renal failure , α-Keto Acid reduce nitrogen supply , decrease urea production , stimulate protein synthesis , suppress protein decomposition , offer adequate essential amino acid body . Furthermore , α-Keto Acid branch chain amino acid stimulate glucagon secretion glucagon-induced cAMP secretion liver , stimulate effect hyperfiltration , thus contribute delay progress nephropathy . It extensively accept limited intake diet protein reduce kidney hyperfiltration renal glomerulus internal pressure effective delaying progress nephropathy . But present , debate exists clinical research paper ( MDRDS ) role low protein diet delay progress nephropathy . Adding compound α-Keto Acid tablet low protein diet patient prevent essential amino acid deficiency ameliorate severity metabolism disorder , thus prevent malnutrition . Compared standard diabetic diet , aim study evaluate efficacy safety compound α-Keto Acid tablet combination low protein diet delay progress nephropathy . This multicentre , randomize , open-label , parallel group , diabetic diet control study . 240 patient meet Inclusion/Exclusion criterion randomize test group control group ratio 1:1 . Test group use low protein diet combination compound α-Keto Acid tablet , control group use routine diabetic diet , efficacy safety test group compare control group 1 year treatment . The study perform 12 centre ensure least 200 evaluable subject obtain . STUDY OBJECTIVES : - To compare efficacy ( ameliorate proteinuria kidney injury ) compound α-Keto Acid tablet combination low protein diet standard diabetic diet delay progress type 2 diabetic nephropathy . - To compare safety compound α-Keto Acid tablet combination low protein diet standard diabetic diet delay progress type 2 diabetic nephropathy . Primary Endpoint : one year treatment Low Protein Diet plus α-Keto Acid Diabetic Diet ; Secondary Endpoint : Death , Dialysis renal transplantation .</detailed_description>
