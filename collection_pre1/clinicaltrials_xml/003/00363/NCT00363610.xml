	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating IV Oncaspar® IV Gemzar® Treatment Solid Tumors Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study study 's sponsor , Enzon Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ( `` Enzon '' ) , learn drug pegaspargase . Pegaspargase drug 's scientific generic name . Because already approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) , also brand name - ONCASPAR® . It approve FDA treatment type leukemia ( cancer white blood cell ) . However , pegaspargase approve FDA treatment cancer study . This study research side effect pegaspargase use another FDA-approved cancer treatment ( chemotherapy ) drug call gemcitabine HCl ; brand name GEMZAR® . It approve treatment patient cancer pancreas patient breast cancer . However , gemcitabine approve FDA treatment type cancer . In addition , combination pegaspargase gemcitabine solid tumor lymphoma study investigational . This type study treatment call `` combination treatment '' `` combination study . '' The information ( research data ) study use Enzon plan `` combination '' research study pegaspargase plus gemcitabine treatment certain cancer .</detailed_description>
