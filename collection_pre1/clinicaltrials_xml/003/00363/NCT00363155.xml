	<brief_title>KRN7000 Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>KRN7000 report inhibit HBV replication HBV transgenic mouse . Anti-viral effect KRN7000 expect HBV , compound able induce IFN-alpha/beta also IFN-gamma TNF-alpha . In two clinical trial , KRN7000 safe healthy volunteer solid cancer patient ; particularly , compound report show drug-related serious adverse event . A phase I/II trial significance assess safety efficacy KRN7000 treatment CHB patient . The 300 microgram/m2 dose level , comparable 10 microgram/kg , consider high safe dose level phase I/II trial CHB patient 3 dose level . Dose incrementation perform logarithmic manner : 0.1 , 1 10 microgram/kg . In phase I trial solid tumor patient , weekly administration KRN7000 allow sufficient time NKT cell recovery . As KRN7000 report activate ligand NKT cell , logical assume dose interval provide time recovery NKT cell optimal . In fact , cytokine production repeat dosing , NKT cell hardly detect peripheral blood , observed . As take approximately 4 week NKT cell recover pre-dose level single administration , monthly administration propose trial .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Chronic hepatitis B ( confirm liver biopsy perform within 3 year prior screening visit HBV DNA serum &gt; 10E5 copies/ml screening visit ) . ALT &gt; 1.2 x ULN two occasion document within 8 week initiation treatment . Able likely attend regularly treatment followup . Written informed consent . Adequate contraception male females treatment followup ( write confirmation ) . Patients evidence cirrhosis . Decompensated liver disease , mark : bilirubin great 20 micromol/L serum albumin &lt; 35 g/L prothrombin time great 3 second prolonged Quick test 70 % history bleed esophageal varix , ascites hepatic encephalopathy . Systemic IFN treatment , systemic antiviral agent , systemic corticosteroid , immune suppressive treatment investigational drug within 3 month entry protocol . Patients ALT level great 10 time ULN enrol may follow three consecutive determination within 2 month level . Pregnancy , woman childbearing potential spouse woman , inability practice adequate contraception . Significant systemic major illness liver disease , include congestive heart failure , ischemic heart disease , angina pectoris , cerebrovascular disease , renal failure ( creatinine clearance le 50 ml/min ) , organ transplantation , serious psychiatric disease depression , anaphylactic disorder . Preexisting severe cytopenia ; Hb &lt; 7 mmol/L , WBC &lt; 3x10E9/L , Plt &lt; 100x10E9/L , Lymphocyte &lt; 0.5x10E9/L . Any history presence autoimmune disease . Evidence hepatocellular carcinoma ; alphafetoprotein ( AFP ) level great 50 ng/ml ultrasound ( image study ) within 6 month prior entry demonstrate mass suggestive liver cancer . Human immunodeficiency virus infection , show presence antiHIV antibody . Patients cerebroside metabolite abnormality ( e.g . Gaucher 's disease ) . Other acquire inherited cause liver disease : hepatitis C , hepatitis D , alcoholic liver disease , obesity induce liver disease , drug relate liver disease , autoimmune liver disease , Wilson 's disease , hemochromatosis , alpha1antitrypsin deficiency . Any condition opinion investigator would make patient unsuitable enrollment , could interfere patient participate complete study .</criteria>
