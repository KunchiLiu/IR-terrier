	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tranexamic acid anti-fibrinolytic agent inhibits fibrinolysis lead reduction blood loss without concurrently increase risk thromboembolic complication . Several study show tranexamic acid reduces blood loss blood transfusion primary total hip knee arthroplasty . However , study evaluate efficacy revision total hip arthroplasty . The significance study need blood transfusion complication may minimize revision hip arthroplasty tranexamic acid find significantly decrease amount blood transfusion . After patient consent , randomize one two group ( tranexamic acid placebo ) School Pharmacy . The placebo crystalloid fluid equal volume tranexamic acid . The patient undergo revision total hip arthroplasty Dr. Rosenstein administer tranexamic acid placebo . Blood loss record intraoperatively postoperatively drain . Criteria blood transfusion include hemoglobin le 10g/dl hematocrit less 30 % . Once operation end , drug placebo discontinue postoperative care unchanged current standards/protocols . Intraoperative blood loss , total blood loss , number blood transfusion record analyze . Length acute hospital stay also record . A cost analysis perform compare tranexamic acid blood transfusion .</detailed_description>
