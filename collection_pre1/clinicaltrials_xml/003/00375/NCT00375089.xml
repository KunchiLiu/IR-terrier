	<brief_summary>Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) rare genetic disorder affect 1 14,000 people United States . As commonly identify genetic cause obesity , PWS often confuse Early-onset Morbid Obesity ( EMO ) . Individuals EMO show sign PWS , clinically PWS . The purpose study evaluate clinical feature genetic basis PWS EMO , determine condition affect person throughout lifetime .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characteristics Prader-Willi Syndrome Early-onset Morbid Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PWS complex neurobehavioral syndrome . Clinical feature include obesity , increase appetite , low muscle tone , cognitive impairment , distinct behavioral feature , hypogonadism , neonatal failure-to-thrive . It commonly recognize genetic cause obesity ; however , many obese child fact PWS . These individual therefore diagnose EMO , condition share feature PWS . The development new advance strategy treat PWS EMO require thorough understanding condition clinical molecular level . One goal study collect long-term data individual PWS EMO order gain well understanding natural progression condition , neonatal period well adulthood . Specific PWS , study establish genotype-phenotype correlation among different sub-types evaluate effect growth hormone treatment disease progression . Lastly , study compare PWS EMO term clinical feature genetic basis . Participation natural history study entail initial evaluation , follow yearly study visit age 3 every 2 year thereafter . Each study visit last 3 4 hour , include physical exam ( include DEXA scan determine body composition ) , psychological testing , interview study physician , evaluation participant 's diet history . In addition , blood test complete genetic testing photo take evaluate disease progression . Cognitive behavioral assessment also conduct last 10 30 minute .</detailed_description>
