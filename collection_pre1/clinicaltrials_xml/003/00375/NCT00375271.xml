	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate different strategy hemodynamic optimization high risk surgical patient first twelve postoperative hour ICU base protocol guide less invasive monitorig tool ( Vigileo® ) , orient fiberoptic central venous catheter allow continuous monitorig SvcO2 ( PreSep® ) , pressure transducer ( FloTrac® ) allow cardiac output calculation standard deviation mean arterial pressure standard resuscitation strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Perioperative Hemodynamic Optimization High-Risk Patients Using Less-Invasive Monitoring Methods</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients submit high risk surgical procedure generally show hyperdynamic pattern due metabolic response surgical trauma . This response fundamentally dependent functional reserve treatment . Data UK show age population 15 30 % mortality first thirty day surgery , generally respiratory cardiac co-morbidities1 . Identification patient besides protocol implementation aim appropriate support basic strategy warrant good outcome post-operative period . Shoemaker establish definition criterion high risk patient end 80 ’ . Those criterion accept today . He demonstrate benefit hemodynamic optimization order achieve “ supra-normal ” oxygen delivery . Unfortunately , year come , backlash concept due result several heterogeneous mislead study cast doubt efficacy strategy . Heyland , however , observed benefit hemodynamic optimization institute surgery . In 90 ’ , support high risk surgical patient new start , publication several study demonstrate reduction morbidity , mortality , hospital ICU lengths stay . In recent metaanalysis twenty one study , Kern Shoemaker conclude mortality reduction hemodynamic optimization start early organ dysfunction ensue . There great benefit study control group 20 % mortality therapy achieve difference oxygen delivery control treatment group . Despite strong evidence favor hemodynamic optimization , long high risk patient identify , study necessary good answer question : importance volemic replacement , best solution use , best method monitor patient response . Catecholamines must use carefully , despite theoretic capacity modulate inflammatory response . It appear optimization do early pre-operative period organ dysfunction ensue yet . We discover long optimization maintain surgery .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year High risk elective surgeries* accord adapt Shoemaker criterion . Request postoperative support surgeon anesthetist . Patients need central venous arterial catheter accord surgeon , critical care physician anesthetist evaluation . Informed consent obtain patient enrol next kin . Patients terminal disease , submit palliative surgery ; Cardiac failure class IV NYHA ; Chronic renal failure without dyalisis intolerant fluid ;</criteria>
