	<brief_summary>The propose study would evaluate benefit riluzole add-on treatment patient schizophrenia already receive medication , still experience symptom . Neuroprotective medication riluzole currently approve treatment amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( Lou Gehrig 's disease ) , severe neurological illness . Due unique mechanism action , riluzole , effective help symptom schizophrenia , would open novel direction treatment schizophrenia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Refractory Schizophrenia With Riluzole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia perhaps one debilitating illness . Over past year limit improvement efficacy medication use treat disorder . In particular , currently available antipsychotic drug small efficacy negative symptom cognitive impairment associate schizophrenia . This critical consider negative symptom cognitive deficit contribute significantly social vocational impairment schizophrenic patient . Furthermore , current treatment always provide satisfactory control positive symptom . While various extracellular neurotransmitter system ( dopamine , 5HT , GABA , etc . ) explore target antipsychotic treatment , substantial body evidence suggest neurodegenerative intracellular process might responsible symptom schizophrenia , result cytopathic effect inadequate cellular functioning . Some process may trigger excitotoxic influence neurotransmitter ( i.e . glutamate ) . As many neuroleptic agent currently use neuroprotective property possible speculate medication primarily neuroprotective mode action might additional help treatment schizophrenia . Huntington 's disease patient advanced form exhibit symptom similar psychotic illness , , recent small ( n=9 ) open label study neuroprotective drug riluzole , show temporary improvement motor function , also cognitive , behavioral functioning ( Seppi 2001 ) . Based , seem possible expect improvement symptom schizophrenia neuroprotective agent riluzole . Riluzole effective medication approve use ALS ( amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , Lou Gehrig 's disease ) one severe rapidly progress neurodegenerative illness affect motor neuron brain spinal cord . A subset ALS inherit involve 70 different mutation antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) thereby contribute reduce antioxidative defense oxidative injury . This result increase reactive oxygen specie level several organs/tissues bulk symptomatology relate degeneration subset CNS neuron . Although riluzole effective human transgenic mouse model familial ALS slow decrease motor power , exact neuroprotective mechanism action know . Various study suggest riluzole might exert beneficial effect inhibition glutamate release , inhibition voltage-gated Na+ channel , also intracellularly inhibit protein kinase C ( PKC ) , enzyme link oxidative neuronal injury . Although riluzole generally well tolerate , side effect occur mostly related gastrointestinal problem , hepatotoxicity asthenia . This 14 week study would evaluate benefit riluzole add-on treatment patient schizophrenia neuroleptic refractory symptom .</detailed_description>

During 3 month prior study entry , patient must inpatient hospital longer 4 week ( cumulative hospitalization ) due worsen psychiatric illness ( although could participate inpatient research protocol ) . Patients able comprehend satisfactorily comply protocol requirement ; Patients PANSS total score 60 high score 4 ( moderate ) high two follow PANSS item : delusion , hallucinatory behavior , conceptual disorganization suspiciousness . CGI scale rating least mildly ill , great severely ill. For woman : The patient must nonpregnant , nonlactating , undergone tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy hysterectomy ; patient must least one year post menopausal ; patient ) negative urine serum pregnancy test ( Beta HCG ) b ) agree reliably practice contraception throughout study . Primary psychiatric diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . Patients psychosurgery Recent ( &lt; 3 week ) change antipsychotic regimen Presence clinically significant somatic disease require frequent change medication could aggravate take riluzole ( i.e . severe liver illness ) Currently receive treatment potentially hepatotoxic drug ( e.g . allopurinol , methyldopa , sulfasalazine ) HIV positive , assessed blood testing ( part avoid subject possible brain HIV infection avoid rare complication rarely occur riluzole induce neutropenia ) Patients pose immediate significant enough risk suicide harm others assess study MD . Pregnant nursing woman , woman childbearing potential use adequate contraception judge unreliable use contraception ( enough experience riluzole use nursing pregnant woman )</criteria>
