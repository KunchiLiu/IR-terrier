	<criteria>Histological cytological diagnosis SCLC ; extensivedisease ( ED ) time study entry Refractory firstline platinumbased chemotherapy ( i.e. , receive one prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimen ) define one following : Best response firstline chemotherapy radiographically document progression ( refractory disease ) Best response firstline chemotherapy radiographically document response stable disease , subsequent document progression continue chemotherapy ( resistant relapse ) Documented progression within 90 day completion firstline chemotherapy ( last dose chemotherapy ) , regardless best response treatment ( resistant relapse ) At least 18 year age ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 Measurable disease define RECIST criterion Measurable disease : The presence least one measurable lesion . If one lesion present , neoplastic nature disease site confirm histology and/or cytology . Measurable lesion : Lesions accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥20mm use conventional technique ≥10mm use spiral CT scan . CT ( include spiral CT ) scan MRI preferred method measurement ; however , chest xrays acceptable lesion clearly define surround aerated lung . Clinically detected lesion consider measurable superficial ( e.g. , skin nodule palpable lymph node ) . For case skin lesion , documentation color photography , include ruler estimate size lesion require . Adequate organ function include follow : Adequate bone marrow reserve : absolute neutrophil ( segmented band ) count ( ANC ) ≥1500 cells/μL , platelet count ≥100,000 cells/μL hemoglobin ≥9g/dL . Hepatic : bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN ; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 3.0 X ULN . Renal : serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min . Cardiac : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 50 % MUGA echocardiography ( intrapatient reassessment LVEF perform via method throughout study ) . Negative serum pregnancy test time enrollment woman childbearing potential . For men woman childbearing potential , use effective contraceptive method study . Ability understand requirement study , provide write informed consent authorization use disclosure protect health information , agree abide study restriction return required assessment . Pregnant nursing woman Chest radiotherapy within previous 28 day radiotherapy within previous 14 day . Recovery acute toxic effect radiation require prior study enrollment . Measurable lesion previously irradiate must enlarge consider target lesion . Prior radiation therapy allow &lt; 25 % bone marrow . More 1 prior chemotherapy regiment SCLC Prior anthracycline treatment Treatment investigational agent within 28 day standard chemotherapy within 21 day prior first dose . Patients must recover acute adverse effecxts prior therapy , exclude alopecia Patients secondary primary malignancy ( except situ carcinoma cervix adequately treat nonmelanomatous carcinoma skin malignancy treat least 2 year previously surgery and/or radiotherapy evidence recurrence since time ) Concurrent severe uncontrolled medical disease ( i.e. , active systemic infection , diabetes , hypertension , coronary artery disease , congestive heart failure ) , opinion Investigator , would compromise safety patient compromise ability patient complete study . Symptomatic central nervous system metastasis . Patients asymptomatic brain metastasis allow . The patient must stable radiotherapy ≥ 2 week corticosteroid ≥ 1 week . History interstitial lung disease pulmonary fibrosis .</criteria>
