	<brief_title>Study Unprotected Left Main Stenting Versus Bypass Surgery ( LE MANS Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The natural history result pharmacological treatment patient severe narrow left main coronary artery show poor prognosis ( 5 year survival le 50 % ) . There general agreement surgical treatment improve 5 year survival patient leave main coronary artery obstruction 3 , however long term survival rate ( 15 year follow-up ) low group ( 37 % 27 % respectively surgical medical group ) . Median survival longer surgical group general population ( 13.3 vs 6.6 year ) , significant difference patient normal LV ejection fraction ( 14.7 vs 15 year ) . With advent coronary stenting encouraging result report several author . There high success rate 98-100 % elective procedure series mortality ( protect non-protected left main ) range 0 3.4 % , 6 month event free survival rate 70-80 % . Restenosis rate stented LM vary 10-22 % proximal LM 40 % distal LM . Final minimal luminal area &gt; =7mm2 post procedure , assess IVUS , predict low restenosis rate 7 % , area &lt; 7mm2 connect restenosis 50 % . Our experience show left main in-stent restenosis treat successfully another percutaneous intervention ( include endarterectomy balloon angioplasty ) well surgical revascularization . Six 12-month survival rate depend LV function . Patients LVEF &gt; 40 % in-hospital event free survival 98 % 9-month event free survival 86 % , whereas patient LVEF &lt; 40 % in-hospital 9 month event-free survival 67 22 % respectively . Additionally , patient present acute myocardial infarction bail-out procedure , early late result LM stenting good elective case . Our previously present promising result leave main stenting mainly relate proper technique LM stenting ( short inflation within LM , careful guide catheter manipulation , stent selection ) , well cautiously design follow-up ( every month visit first six month , routine coronary angiography within 3-6 month procedure ) . This initial experience give u background large prospective randomize trial compare elective surgical revascularisation percutaneous intervention patient LM coronary artery disease . It impression design delivery system new generation stent uniquely suit safely treat difficult subset patient . At present time would limit study discrete lesion proximal ( ostial mid ) leave main reference luminal diameter &gt; =3 mm . Based publish result stenting IVUS examination lesion estimate restenosis rate well 10 % . As expect , survival complication rate within one year group similar . Therefore main concern weather treatment strategy offer prevention LV function , well improvement functional capacity coronary reserve group period 2-3 year .</detailed_description>
