	<brief_title>Racial Disparity Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endometrial cancer fourth common cancer among woman common gynecologic cancer . Although incidence well-differentiated early stage endometrial cancer high among white woman , appear increased incidence aggressive variant increase mortality rate among black . Reported 5-year survival rate white woman endometrial cancer 90 % black woman 60 % survival . ( 1,2 ) Black woman tend aggressive cancer adverse symptom non-endometrioid histology , grade 3 differentiation , stage III IV cancer . ( 3,7 ) Many study identify establish risk factor beneficial behavior endometrial cancer , modifiable . Some major risk include obesity , hypertension , high fat diet , diabetes , smoking , increase age , hormone replacement therapy , tamoxifen use . Behaviors associate decreased risk use oral contraceptive , breast feeding , physical activity . ( 4 ) There also evidence biologic factor may contribute development malignant endometrial neoplasm . Both mutation expression p53 tumor suppressor gene see patient endometrial cancer , especially advanced stage . Normally , increased level p53 present cell damage DNA . p53 trigger cell produce p21 , molecule bind cyclin-dependent kinase 2 ( Cdk2 ) . In unbound state , Cdk2 allow cell progress synthesis stage cell cycle ; therefore , remain arrested GÄ± phase couple p21 effort prevent proliferation abnormal cell . In addition mechanism , p53 think involve induction apoptosis . There indication black woman may exhibit increased incidence p53 expression compare white woman . ( 5,6,8 ) Another biologic factor involve endometrial cancer estrogen receptor . In contrast p53 , presence estrogen receptor positive prognostic factor provide potential avenue treat endometrial carcinoma . However , receptor must functional order advantageous . Some tumor contain mutated estrogen receptor , cause change metabolic pathway . Individuals mutate receptor vary susceptibility develop endometrial cancer . ( 9 ) Aromatase enzyme involve convert androgen estrogen . Both estrogen aromatase excess identify endometrial cancer , aromatase activity indicate normal endometrium . Most aromatase activity appear confine stromal cell correlate stromal invasion . It may possible inhibit aromatase effort decrease estrogen level potentially halt cancer growth . ( 10,11 ) Uterine papillary serous carcinoma ( UPSC ) aggressive variant endometrial cancer characterize early metastasis , resistance therapy , high mortality rate . Smaller study suggest HER-2/neu may involve tumorigenesis disease . ( 13 ) Overexpression HER2/neu receptor UPSC independent variable associate poor overall survival , bad overall prognosis , occur frequently black woman , may contribute racial disparity survival .
