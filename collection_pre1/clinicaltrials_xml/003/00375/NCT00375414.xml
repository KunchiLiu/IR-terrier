	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : PEG perform pull , push introducer technique , pull method one commonly use worldwide . PEG site infection clearly common procedure relate complication PEG placement routinely use pull technique show quite high ( 4-30 % ) , peristomal infectious complication . To curtail infectious complication various gastroenterological society recommend give intravenous prophylactic antibiotic 30 minute prior procedure show significantly reduce complication . Despite incidence peristomal infectious complication remain high post PEG . Another problem associate administration prophylactic antibiotic emergence resistant micro-organisms especially Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) PEG site . Introducer PEG technique PEG placement avoids transit PEG catheter oropharynx . Despite introduction since 19 year back become popular among endoscopists technical difficulty complication associate . However new introducer PEG technique use endoscopic gastropexy show quite safe easy perform recent study . We institute perform procedure since January 2003 prospective follow find much low incidence peristomal infection . Recently Maetani et al already demonstrate prospective randomise trial introducer type PEG result fewer infectious complication compare conventional pull PEG . There study compare introducer PEG technique without administration prophylactic antibiotic . As principal , chance infection much low introducer technique . We want address issue randomise double blind placebo control setting patient unfit undergo routine pull PEG upper gastrointestinal ( UGI ) malignant stenosis . SUMMARY : Peristomal infection commonest complication PEG despite prophylactic antibiotic may result emergence resistant micro-organism like Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) . Introducer PEG technique avoids travel PEG catheter oropharynx richly inhabitated microorganism chance infectious complication raw PEG wound negligible . This technique popular associate risk complication past show result complication like deflation balloon , catheter dislodgement , lead peritonitis etc . However new introducer PEG gastropexy recently prove safe . At institute 200 PEG procedure perform annually , 10-12 % tight stenotic stricture pull PEG possible without dilatation oropharyngeal tract . We plan randomise patient 2 group without antibiotic ( placebo ) . PEG do use new introducer PEG , FrekaÂ® Pexact CH/FR 15 ( Fresenius Kabi , Germany ) , gastric wall suture non surgically anterior abdominal wall use 2 silk suture . Peristomal wound would assess daily 7 day use 2 type point score system ( give Jain Gossner ) 2 member nutrition support team independently . As objective score system , intend determine grade post procedure peristomal infection patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients tight stenotic malignant lesion upper GI tract ( i.e . esophagus oropharynx ) routine pull PEG possible without dilatation/bougeinage UGI tract . The GI lumen patient include study would sufficiently enough diameter allow passage thin ( 8.8 mm ) endoscope . Allergies Ceftriaxone antibiotic , Patients receive systemic antibiotic , Any contraindication PEG like , severe coagulation disorder , peritonitis , peritoneal carcinomatosis , burn inability achieve transillumination .</criteria>
