	<brief_title>Phase I Study Gemcitabine , Sorafenib Radiotherapy Patients With Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic cancer treatment hamper resistance chemo radiotherapy . Gemcitabine-based chemoradiotherapy become one standard therapy localize unresectable pancreatic cancer , poor response survival rate less 12 month . Radiotherapy increase VEGF expression activate Ras/MEK/ERK pathway may contribute radioresistance , thus addition anti-angiogenic agent and/or Ras/ERK inhibitor could enhance radiation mediate cytotoxicity . Sorafenib novel dual-action Raf kinase vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGF-R2 VEGF-R3 ) inhibitor target angiogenic Ras-Raf-1 signal transduction pathway . Based upon preliminary laboratory clinical data Sorafenib hold promise improving outcome therapy patient locally advance unresectable pancreatic cancer . Polymorphisms gene involve angiogenesis pathway ( VEGF , VEGF-R2 , HIF-1 eNOS ) may contribute process angiogenesis , tumor behavior , may explain heterogeneity efficacy ( toxicity ) agent whose major mechanism action block angiogenesis33-37 . Proteomic analysis may also contribute identify pattern response resistance therapy , potentially predict outcome . Dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) -MRI show useful pharmacodynamic marker biological activity anti-angiogenic agents38-40 may also predict radiation therapy-induced vascular changes41 . In vivo image angiogenesis use DCE-MRI analysis angiogenesis marker genetic polymorphism may predict response clinical benefit therapy unresectable pancreatic cancer patient . These biologic pharmacodynamic endpoint analyse correlate tumor activity see .</detailed_description>
