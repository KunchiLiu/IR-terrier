	<brief_title>Study Effectiveness Hand Exercises Treat Symptoms Hand Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis one common joint disorder elderly , yet study target symptomatic osteoarthritis , especially symptomatic hand osteoarthritis . Hand OA chronic disease cure currently available , symptomatic pharmacologic treatment significant side effect , none recommend passive modality physical therapy demonstrate improve function . To end , study constitutes systematic approach show patient hand OA might benefit intervention free side effect , easily administer , readily acceptable . STUDY OBJECTIVE : To evaluate efficacy exercise reduction hand functional disability associate hand osteoarthritis symptomatic radiographic . Intervention activity : A 16-week , home-based exercise program design decrease physical impairment hand . The exercise routine consist nine ( 9 ) exercise perform daily , bilaterally . The program take 10-20 minute complete . Six ( 6 ) exercise involve active range-of-motion ( AROM ) three ( 3 ) involve hand finger flexion use Thera-Band ® Hand Exerciser ( Hygenic Corporation , Akron , OH ) . The Hand Exerciser polymer ball resistance varies color , yellow 'extra soft ' approximately 1.5 lbs 50 % compress , red `` soft '' 3 lb , green `` medium '' 5 lb , blue `` firm '' 8 lb . The Hand Exerciser come two size ; `` regular '' use small average sized hand `` extra large '' large hand . The start resistance subject determine baseline grip pinch static strength test . Those weak grip key pinch use soft ball , strong subject use medium firm , per predetermine standard . Some subject may use one color ball depend clinical presentation ( e.g. , great pain dysfunction MCP may require soft ball pinching exercise , firm ball appropriate gripping ) . A study booklet write instruction photo describe perform exercise . Control activity : Application fragrance-free non-therapeutic topical cream , apply daily . A study booklet write instruction photo describe apply cream . Order activity crossover study assign randomly use random number table . There 16-week washout period intervention two treatment period , regardless order subject begin use treatment . The washout period design allow measure return original baseline much possible . The study 48 week duration ( three 16-week period ) . Subjects enrol dynamic entry cohort . Subjects note adverse reaction exercise topical hand cream . They report principal investigator trial . All subject ask complete Participation Log . This give study investigator surrogate measure participation compliance . As well collect information concern demographic , medication , relevant medical social history baseline , assessment participant ask complete AUSCAN Index ( Australian Canadian Osteoarthritis Hand Index ( AUSCAN ) [ Bellamy , 2002 ] ) . The AUSCAN Index self-administered questionnaire ass three dimension pain , joint stiffness , disability due hand osteoarthritis use battery 15 question . Scaled 5-point Likert scale 100mm Visual Analog Scales , AUSCAN 3.1 valid , reliable responsive measure outcome . The index subject validation study address follow clinometric issue : reliability - stability , internal consistency ; validity - face , content , construct ; responsiveness . The 100mm VA Scale use current study . At baseline 16 week two treatment period ( exercise cream ) subject ' maximum grip , key pinch , 3-point pinch strength assess use Jamar® grip pinch dynamometer ( Sammons Preston Rolyan , Bolingbrook , IL ) . Dexterity measure use standard test Purdue Peg Board ( Lafayette Instruments , Lafayette , IN ) . Data collection schedule The AUCSAN Index administer subject complete specified lengths participation . All participant assess three time exercise hand cream intervention period . 1 . Baseline 2 . 8 week 3 . 16 week In addition , bilateral hand grip , key pinch , &amp; 3-point pinch maximum strength , hand dexterity ( best 3 trial ) test two point two intervention period . 1 . Baseline 2 . 16 week STATISTICAL METHODS Statistical analysis perform use SAS statistical software ( version 9.12 , Cary , NC ) . Group differences change baseline 16 week hand function compare . Values score test Gaussian distribution ( normality test ) . If data normally distribute , parametric test ( pair t-test ) use . If data normally distribute , non-parametric test ( sign ranks test ) use . Data analyze per intent-to-treat .</detailed_description>
