	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine treatment exercise-induced Bronchospasm montelukast help college athlete train effectively thus become competitive non ergogenic manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Montelukast Occult Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm ( EIB ) affect 7-30 % highly trained athlete . The first phase study screen varsity level college athlete EIB use Eucapnic hyperventilation ( EVH ) . Those athlete screen positive , enrolled phase two , randomize double-blinded placebo control double crossover study . At enrollment , athletes undergo cardiopulmonary stress test ( CPST ) induce sputum sample prescribed daily montelukast/placebo three week period . Athletes return three week repeat EVH , CPST , induce sputum . They one week washout period follow crossover daily montelukast/placebo another three week . After second three week return final EVH , CPST , induce sputum . The goal study demonstrate effectively blunt EIB response montelukast , index ventilation , exercise tolerance , perhaps overall physical fitness improve , allow athlete train effectively , nonergogenic manner .</detailed_description>
