	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Mild Hypothermia protective effect residual hearing patient undergo cochlear implantation</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Evaluate Effect Lowering Body Temperature During Cochlear Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothermia show protective effect follow trauma central nervous system peripheral auditory system . We previously demonstrate protective effect mild hypothermia auditory function cause cochlear implant electrode animal model . Preservation residual hearing patient undergo cochlear implantation highly desirable base animal study , may possible achieve human subject use mild degree hypothermia . We propose investigate hypothesize protective effect intra-operative hypothermia adult subject undergoing cochlear implantation . Inclusion Criteria : Adults great equal 18 year age measurable auditory function undergo cochlear implantation routine management severe profound hearing loss . Exclusion Criteria : Pure tone average hearing ( mean .5 , 1 2 KHz ) worse 100dB ; Age &gt; 70 year ; History arrhythmia ischemic heart disease ; sickle cell trait disease ; immune incompetence ; coagulation disorder ; revision cochlear implant ; body-mass index &gt; 35 ; cold related disorder . Phase I : Up 40 healthy adult subject qualify CI undergo implantation core body temperature lower 34 degree Centigrade approximately one hour electrode insertion 30 minute insertion . Otherwise , surgical technique unchanged standard procedure . The heating/cooling blanket FDA approve device . similar temperature control blanket use virtually operation do general anesthesia . Each subject 's temperature gradually lower put sleep . Warming least 30 minute subject awaken . We measure record subject 's temperature every 5 15 minute operate room also recovery room . Each subject undergo battery audiometric test ( CNC word , HINT sentence , pure tone threshold , immittance ) within one month prior implantation , one month post operatively , 6 month post operatively 1 year postoperatively . Outcomes analyzed PI 10 subject complete 1 month test interval . If outcomes indicate proof principle ( measurable pure tone responses great equal 60 % subject ) , phase two study initiate . If , outcomes analyzed 20 , 30 , 40 subject evidence hear conservation lack establish , lead follow study preclude . Phase II : Up 80 healthy adult qualify CI randomize control group ( CI surgery use standard procedure core body temperature 37 degree C ) active group ( identical core body temperature 34 degree C ) . Subjects randomize use random table number . The patient , surgeon audiologist blind group assignment . Only study coordinator sequester locked list randomization blinding . Only anesthesiologist know patient ' assignment time surgery . The audiologist present O.R . outpatient clinic , test patient post surgery . Each subject undergo battery audiometric test ( CNC word , HINT sentence , pure tone threshold , immittance ) prior implantation , 1 month post operatively , 6 month post operatively 1 year postoperatively .</detailed_description>
