	<brief_title>HERMES STUDY : Study Feasibility Efficiency Noninvasive Positive-Pressure Ventilation ( NPPV ) Prehospital Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) increasingly use care patient suffer acute respiratory failure . High-level evidence support use NPPV setting . With selected patient , NPPV decrease rate intubation , mortality nosocomial infection . NPPV obviate intubation &gt; 50 % appropriately select patient . Both nasal oronasal interface successfully use apply NPPV , oronasal ( facial ) interface often use acute respiratory failure . Any ventilator ventilator mode use apply NPPV , practice , portable pressure ventilator pressure-support mode commonly use . In acute setting , therapy must apply soon possible onset problem . With research team , demonstrate NPPV use success emergency department . In experience , NPPV early use , part patient improve rapidly could admit general ward . An interesting fact time improve clinical situation short postulate NPPV application emergency department may use `` clinical triage '' . We also demonstrate early application bi-level NPPV patient acute respiratory failure due acute exacerbation COPD APO lead rapid improvement clinical status blood gas differs substantially evolution similar patient treat conventional medical therapy placebo NPPV device . Currently , data real utility use NPPV Out-of-Hospital patient acute respiratory failure manage medical team pre-hospital care despite fact approach decrease delay application efficient ventilator support . A prior study Craven coll . demonstrate NPPV help relieve dyspnea patient suspect congestive heart failure . We postulate short delay onset symptomatology application NPPV increase part select patient good clinical outcome ( intubation , need intensive care ) . Comparisons : Patients COPD , APO standard medical therapy + NPPV compare patient standard medical therapy alone pre-hospital setting .</detailed_description>
