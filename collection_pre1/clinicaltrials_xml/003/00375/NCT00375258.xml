	<criteria>All trauma patient ongoing significant haemorrhage ( systolic blood pressure le 90 mmHg and/or heart rate 110 beat per minute ) , consider risk significant haemorrhage , within 8 hour injury , eligible trial entry appear least 16 year old . Although entry allow 8 hour injury , early patient treat well . The fundamental eligibility criterion responsible doctor 's 'uncertainty ' whether use antifibrinolytic agent particular adult traumatic haemorrhage . Patients responsible doctor considers clear indication antifibrinolytic therapy randomise . Likewise , patient consider clear contraindication antifibrinolytic therapy ( , perhaps , clinical evidence thrombotic disseminate intravascular coagulation ) randomise . Where responsible doctor substantially uncertain whether use antifibrinolytic , patient eligible randomisation consider trial . There prespecified exclusion criterion</criteria>
