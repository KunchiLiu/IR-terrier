	<brief_summary>The purpose study - determine degree endothelial dysfunction inflammation calcific aortic valve disease associate coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . - determine whether relationship calcium metabolism calcific aortic valve disease associate CAD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Risk Factors Associated With Calcification Aortic Valve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease , mainly coronary artery disease , cause one half death develop country . Only recently , calcific aortic valve disease , prove belong family atherosclerosis . It associate high cardiovascular morbidity mortality , cause entirely clear . The link significant coronary artery disease , probably , high importance . We compare group patient coronary artery disease calcific stenotic , sclerotic intact aortic valve . The aim ass compare risk profile verify hypothesis , within significant coronary artery disease , calcific aortic valve identifies subgroup patient high cardiovascular risk , assess endothelial dysfunction two year follow-up cardiovascular event optimally set treatment . Further , study possible association valvular calcification calcium metabolism patient normal kidney function .</detailed_description>
