	<detailed_description>The trial conduct Personnel Clinic , Clinical virology Unit , Hadassah University Hospital . Candidates participation trial : Patients present clinic influenza-like symptom ; men woman age 20 yrs- 65 yrs sign write informed consent Excluded trial : - Pregnant woman woman exclude pregnancy . - Patients diabetes . - Immune-suppressed patient , include patient take immunosuppressive drug . - Patients renal failure . - Patients receive recent influenza vaccine . The study participant receive treatment ( either Sambucol placebo ) five day . The follow-up period 10 day . All patient initially include trial follow 10 day . Inclusion criterion : - Fever ≥ 380C . - The presence least one follow respiratory symptom : cough , sore throat , nasal congestion/ runny nose . - The presence least one follow systemic symptom : headache , fatigue , myalgia , chills/sweats , malaise . Study Patients A total 100 patient laboratory-confirmed influenza infection include study ( 50 study arm ) . This calculation base expect percentage recovery within 3 day initial treatment ( allow 80 % patient give active component show improvement oppose 50 % placebo patient ) . Assuming 50 % patient present influenza-like illness laboratory-confirmed influenza infection , total number 200 patient expect . The primary efficacy endpoint length time resolution influenza illness ( defined period start study drug relief symptom ) . Study design : 1 . Patients present clinic indicated inclusion criterion refer clinic nurse physician establish diagnosis 2 . The temperature , presence severity influenza symptom include cough , nasal obstruction , sore throat , fatigue , headache , myalgia record four-point scale ( 0-absent , 1-mild , 2-moderate , 3-severe ) . Patients also record ability normal activity , overall health status , sleep quality ten-point scale ( 0-unable worst , 10-fully able , best ) 3 . For influenza detection , nose throat swab collect baseline . 4 . Patients randomly assign receive either Sambucol placebo ( 15 cc 4 time daily 5 day ) . 5 . Patients instructed relief medication ( Acamol /Optalgin ) take require , use record . 6 . The follow-up include parameter ( see `` 2 '' ) record daily day 1-5 , day 7 , day 10 . 7 . Compliance study drug record . 8 . In case patient 's condition deteriorates , patient examine clinic rule presence complication ( pneumonia , sinusitis , bronchitis ) . 9 . Statistical analysis include duration severity symptom well use relief medication . Laboratory diagnosis influenza infection : Combined nose throat specimen test presence influenza virus Clinical Virology Unit real-time PCR , follow viral RNA extraction , use TaqMan ABI 7900 instrument . Primers fluorescent probe specific influenza A B virus employ multiplex reaction . Specimens find positive influenza real-time PCR subject influenza culture MDCK cell . The recovered influenza virus subtyped hemagglutination inhibition , use specific antiserum obtain WHO , multiplex reverse transcription ( RT ) - PCR reaction , use specific primer influenza B well different influenza A H N .</detailed_description>
