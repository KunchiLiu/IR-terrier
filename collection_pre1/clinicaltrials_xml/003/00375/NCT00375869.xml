	<brief_title>Safety Darbepoetin Alfa Treatment Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) common neurosurgical problem high morbidity mortality . Studies interested define possible therapeutic target TBI lead appreciation two phase injury . These phase refer primary secondary TBI . The primary injury encompasses immediate insult , diffuse axonal injury , hemorrhage , contusion , primary ischemia . The secondary injury evolve post-traumatic period due combination vasogenic cytotoxic edema result several process include ; glutamate excitotoxicity , disturbance ionic homeostasis , lipid peroxidation , generation nitric oxide ( NO ) free radical , release inflammatory regulator bradykinin eicosanoids . It long recognize one important factor secondary injury process indiscriminate release excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate neuron glia . Glutamate excitotoxicity lead substantial intraneuronal release calcium turn mediates activation phospholipases generate arachadonic acid , activation protease , activation NO , cause neuronal membrane disruption loss ionic equilibrium . Receptors erythropoietin ( EPOr ) distribute throughout brain study demonstrate receptor important process development also neuroprotection . Treatment erythropoietin ( EPO ) protect neuron model ischemic traumatic degenerative damage due exocitotoxins consequent generation free radical include NO . EPOr activation also prevent indiscriminate exocytosis glutamate model chemically induced ischemia neuron rat hippocampus . The hypothesis study treatment severely brain injured patient darbepoetin alfa ( Aranesp® ) safe reduce cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) level glutamate within 96 hour period traumatic brain injury . This effect potentially mediate activation EPO receptor whose activation prevent exocytosis glutamate , know neurocytotoxin , CSF .</detailed_description>
