	<brief_summary>Although clinical risk factor postoperative development vasodilatory shock acute renal failure identify ; considerable proportion patient undergoing cardiac surgery syndrome predict . We seek investigate impact Catecholamine-O-Methyltransferase ( COMT ) polymorphism duration vasodilatory shock important clinical outcome cardiac surgery patient . COMT key enzyme degradation catechols eg . catecholamine . 25 % population low activity ( L/L ) enzyme . Sustained low COMT activity associate alter metabolic profile catecholamine degradation product . The process cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) over-activates mechanisms body use defend severe infection . One main overactive defence mechanism release highly toxic compound derive oxygen - process call 'oxidative-stress ' . Increased reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) generation lead inactivation biologic mediator , include catecholamine . It well establish radical autoxidizes catecholamine , include DA , NE , epinephrine contribute significantly vasoplegia . As part study , take six 2.7mL sample blood , collect , operation , arterial catheter routinely insert every patient . This blood use measure COMT genotype , concentration plasma-catecholamines well marker oxidative stress . Our plan enrol patient undergo cardiac surgery use CPB plan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim study To explore impact LL COMT genotype clinical biological outcome variable patient undergo cardiac surgery compare HH genotype . Background Cardiac surgery show effective method prolong life patient severe coronary artery disease valvular disease combination thereof . Catechol-O-Methyl-Transferase ( COMT ) catalyse O-methylation biologically active catechols responsible degradation catecholamine catecholestradiols . COMT intracellular enzyme , widely distribute throughout human tissue ( Roth , Maennistoe ) Because COMT express ubiquitously , appear COMT genotype significantly affect level catecholamine throughout body . 25 % Caucasians homozygous low COMT activity , ( COMT LL=Met/Met ) , 25 % homozygous high activity COMT ( COMT HH=Val/Val ) , 50 % heterozygous ( COMT HL=Val/Met ) . ( Palmatier , Spielman , Boudikova ) Thus , COMT polymorphism may play important role outcome patient cardiac surgery . So far , study due polymorphism exist chronic , non-cardiac surgery disorder like psychiatric disease , breast cancer alcoholism . In prospective observational study , use model CPB-induced stress-mediated vasodilatory shock investigate impact COMT polymorphism relevant postoperative clinical outcome . Within model test hypothesis , cardiac surgery patient , LL COMT genotype associate alteration catecholamine metabolism adverse hospital outcome prolong vasopressor support acute renal failure compare HL HH COMT genotype . Patients L/L COMT polymorphism probably use high concentration endogenous catecholamine , low COMT enzyme activity cause impaired degradation catecholamine . Patients L/L COMT polymorphism require presumably high catecholamine support patient maintain cardiovascular stability extreme stress-conditions occur CPB procedure . Acute renal failure ( ARF ) common postoperative complication cardiac surgery patient associate increased morbidity mortality . Catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) show high activity proximal tubular epithelial cell - target cell ARF . We hypothesize COMT met158 genotype might associate increase risk acute renal failure compare COMT val158 genotype . CPB activate component non-specific immune system , lead generation compound contain oxygen free radical . A study 14 patient undergoing cardiac surgery find increase level serum lipid peroxidation product ( thiobarbituric acid reactive substance ) within 15 minute commencement CPB , return preoperative level follow morning . The total serum antioxidative capacity correspondingly decrease intraoperatively , remain decreased 24 hour postoperatively . Outcomes length vasopressor support patient LL COMT genotype compare patient HL HH COMT genotype . We hypothesize significant increase duration vasopressor support patient LL COMT compare patient HL HH COMT genotype . Additional outcome measure hypotheses We hypothesize difference similar see duration vasopressor support see high proportion postoperative acute renal failure ( increase serum creatinine &gt; 50 % baseline peak value ) , long duration ICU hospital stay LL COMT patient compare HL HH patient . COMT genotype determine level endogenous catecholamine measure cardiac surgery . We hypothesize high level endogenous catecholamine measure patient LL COMT genotype . Study Design - overview rationale COMT genotype outcome measurement patient cardiac surgery analyze study . Concentrations plasma catecholamine important degradation product determine use CPB . The duration dose postoperative vasopressor support well stay ICU stay hospital document . Data collection age , sex , body mass index ( BMI ) , body surface area ( BSA , insulin ( IDDM ) non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) , arterial hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , preoperative serum creatinine , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , smoke status , peripheral vascular disease ( PVD ) , carotid artery disease , myocardial infarction ( MI ) stroke within last six month , atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , grade leave ventricular dysfunction define leave ventricular ejection fraction use EuroScore definition . Pre-operative medication include : platelet inhibitor , ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin-II-receptor1-antagonists , beta-blocker , calcium channel blocker statin . Intra-operative data type cardiac surgery ( valvular coronary artery bypass ( CABG ) , concomitant complex cardiac surgery involve ascend aorta ) , Redo operation , take back operating room , electronically store MAP duration CPB . The intra- post-operative use vasopressor ( norepinephrine , epinephrine , phenylephrine , ephedrine , metaraminol ) inotropic medication ( milrinone , dobutamine ) hourly discharge Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . We note low MAP low cardiac index ( CI ) every 6 hour . Postoperative serum creatinine measure daily . Finally , ICU hospital length stay well hospital mortality document . Withdrawal The treat clinician right withdraw patient study believe continued participation jeopardise patient 's well . Ethical Issues Given potential knowledge future balance benefit risk , consider ethical proceed seek inform consent . This drug trial interventional trial . Indemnity This investigator-initiated study sponsor industry . The investigator member staff Austin Hospital ; hospital responsible indemnify investigator relation study . Warringal Private Hospital responsible indemnification patient recruit .</detailed_description>
