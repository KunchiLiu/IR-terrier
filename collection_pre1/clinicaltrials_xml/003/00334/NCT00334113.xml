	<brief_title>Telerehabilitation Intervention Promote Exercise Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately two third American adult overweight ( body mass index - BMI &gt; 25 ) , nearly one third American adult obese ( BMI &gt; 30 ) veteran exhibit even high rate overweight obese general population . Obesity significant risk factor number serious medical condition , include diabetes , associate high rate morbidity , mortality . Greater 80 % individual diabetes overweight obese . Sixteen million Americans diagnose diabetes , speculate number increase 23 million year 2010 . Furthermore , substantially high prevalence diabetes veteran population compare general population , nearly 16 percent veteran affect . This alarm increase associate increase prevalence obesity sedentary lifestyle . In conference conduct National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases 1999 , conclude major research initiative need address grow problem physical inactivity obesity major impact behavior development treatment diabetes . The benefit associate exercise diabetic population extensive , even though regular exercise typically prescribe significant component diabetic treatment plan , compliance tends poor . The overarch objective study adapt low cost telephone intervention use enhance exercise adoption population overweight obese veteran type 2 diabetes . The primary aim study implement evaluate effectiveness telehealth intervention six month period . The secondary aim evaluate impact telehealth intervention weight diabetes relevant physical health parameter , quality life psychological distress . If telehealth intervention find efficacious , tertiary aim evaluate cost effectiveness intervention . Over 4-year period , 140 overweight obese veteran type 2 diabetes recruit VA Boston Healthcare System . All participant evaluate provide exercise prescription home base walk program . Participants randomize either Exercise Prescription condition alone , Exercise Prescription plus TLC-PED ( Telephone Linked Care - Promoting Exercise Diabetes ) , automate telehealth intervention . TLC-PED use interactive voice response recognition telephone technology provide individualize phone message participant diabetes . It develop incorporate theoretical principle know enhance exercise adoption . Specifically , intervention use motivate principle base transtheoretical model change . Those TLC-PED condition receive weekly automate telephone call six month period . It hypothesize overweight veteran diabetes receive TLC-PED intervention ( versus ) six month participation home base walk program likely engage regular physical activity obtain improvement self-reported physical activity , maintain change twelve month period .</detailed_description>
