	<brief_summary>Anticoagulation warfarin common potentially hazardous therapeutic intervention . It lead cause iatrogenic bleeding event , hence , malpractice claim . There good alternative presently warfarin anticoagulation , even alternative become available ( i.e. , ximelagatran ) , cost , label , experience ( outcomes-related ) issue continue favor extensive ongoing use warfarin . If present study able confirm advantage genotype-driven algorithm , term improve efficiency , therapeutic efficacy , , especially , safety , pharmacogenetics approach warfarin dosing recommend basis Intermountain Health Care ( IHC ) -wide quality improvement initiative improve patient outcome , reduce resource use ( cost achieve safe therapeutic anticoagulation ) , reduce adverse clinical event . COUMA-GEN prospective , randomized study patient begin chronic warfarin therapy specific , qualify clinical reason ( i.e. , atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) , post-orthopedic surgery prophylaxis ) . Qualifying patient consent randomized individualize , genotype-based warfarin-dosing regimen standard care ( without knowledge genotype ) . In study arm , predict maintenance dose determine . All patient receive baseline International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) . For patient 3 entry stratum , start dose warfarin twice assign daily maintenance dose ( accord specific treatment arm ) prescribe first second day , dose revert assign maintenance dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pharmacogenetic Study Warfarin Dosing , `` The COUMA-GEN Study ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study determine 1. whether pharmacogenetic guide arm maintain patient great time therapeutic range ( TTR - percentage value target therapeutic range therapeutic INR establish ) without clinical adverse event ( i.e. , bleed complication thromboembolic event ) , 2. whether pharmacogenetic guide arm achieve high percentage therapeutic warfarin level day 5 8 therapy ( without intervene non-study dose adjustment ) , 3. whether pharmacogenetic guide arm reduce need unplanned dose adjustment additional INR measurement excessive ( insufficient ) INR level clinical adverse event , i.e. , bleed complication thromboembolic event . The goal achieve &gt; 75 % TTR PG-algorithm arm . Compare proportion patient reach therapeutic INR day 5 8 subsequent overall proportion ( `` time '' ) INR measurement therapeutic range ( TTR ) 3 month standard PG-based arm . This study enroll 200 qualifying , consent patient either gender , 18 year , ethnicity , life expectancy &gt; 1 year , begin chronic outpatient warfarin therapy AF , emergency department/outpatient therapy spontaneous DVT , inpatient therapy ( continued 1 mo ) orthopedic surgery DVT prevention , heart failure patient ( EF &lt; 25 % apical akinesis leave ventricular aneurysm extensive wall motion abnormality ) start therapy reduce risk thromboembolism .</detailed_description>
