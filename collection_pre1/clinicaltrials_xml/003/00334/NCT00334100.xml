	<brief_title>Treadmill Training Chronic MS : Efficacy Cost-effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis chronic inflammatory demyelinate disease central nervous system , cause episodic , static progressive disability . Frequently , MS cause weakness spasticity legs lead gait abnormality immobility . Rehabilitation widely use MS subject limited investigation . In particular , traditional thinking MS provider aerobic exercise could cause worsen symptoms patient generally avoid . Recent study suggest aerobic exercise tolerate patient improve fitness . In recent study however , train bicycle ergometer translate improve biomechanics gait . This suggest aerobic training may need couple task specific train produce improve gait . With recent change medical care focus cost containment , study support effectiveness cost-effectiveness rehabilitation intervention need . Studies stroke literature suggest task specific training may useful promote motor reorganization cortex , reverse muscle waste improve cardiovascular de-conditioning . In particular , examine use treadmill train patient chronic hemiparesis due stroke find course training improve walk ability , cause increase motor representation effect limb measure fMRI , increase muscle mass measure thigh CT muscle biopsy , improve cardiovascular fitness measure treadmill stress test . Proposed pilot study test program treadmill train patient chronic leg weakness spasticity due MS cause chronic gait problem . The primary objective pilot study demonstrate safety tolerability treadmill train program MS patient obtain preliminary data outcome use determine sample size large trial design document efficacy cost-effectiveness . Forty MS patient impaired ambulation randomize 3 month program treadmill train 3 month education counsel program attention equal treadmill train group . Both group follow total 6 month . The treadmill train carry Senior Exercise Research Center Baltimore VAMC . Outcome measure include measure leg strength spasticity , disability ( EDSS ) , walk ability , cardiovascular fitness , Quality Life , depression , healthcare cost utilization ( compare year prior enrollment ) . The result pilot study use design gain support study size measure efficacy cost effectiveness .</detailed_description>
