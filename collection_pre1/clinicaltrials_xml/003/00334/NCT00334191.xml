	<brief_summary>Many patient develop kidney failure cardiac surgery . Although kidney failure usually treat effectively , long stay intensive care often require . While many patient suffer long term ill effect develop post-operative kidney failure , require long term kidney dialysis . We also know patient develop post-operative kidney failure much likely die leave hospital . Why people develop kidney failure cardiac surgery know . However , doctor suspect process cardiopulmonary bypass ( function heart lungs take machine operation , allow surgeon operate ) overactivates mechanisms body use defend severe infection . Many cell change severe infection cause kidney failure also occur cardiopulmonary bypass . One main overactive defence mechanism release highly toxic compound derive oxygen - process call 'oxidative stress ' . The investigator believe sodium bicarbonate might reduce oxidative stress , occur cardiac surgery , prevent decrease kidney failure , occur many patient . The investigator hope give sodium bicarbonate ( similar dos use safely treatment acidosis ) patient , 24 hour cardiac surgery , compare effect patient sodium bicarbonate . The drug , placebo , give drip , present cardiac surgery patient . Whether particular patient receive drug placebo decide random , neither patient investigator know give . We measure kidney function operation use standard blood test . The investigator also take four 20ml sample blood , space , , operation , arterial catheter routinely insert every patient . This blood would use measure oxidative stress , also proteins inside blood cell , responsible create toxic oxygen compound . In way discover effect sodium bicarbonate , also mechanism effect . Sodium bicarbonate commonly use treat metabolic acidosis severe renal disease , circulatory insufficiency due shock severe dehydration show effective drug prevent contrast-induced nephropathy . Sodium bicarbonate consider safe set intensive care treatment often use treatment patient metabolic acidosis without discernible adverse clinical effect . This pilot study . If drug prof effective context , study large scale would require justify general use . There extra risk patient participates study , discomfort normally associate cardiac surgery . Informed consent obtain patient prior operation one investigator ICU research nurse . The clinical care patient consent reason affect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Renal impairment follow cardiopulmonary bypass common . 11.4 % 42 % patient previously normal renal function show postoperative rise serum creatinine . While patient require either short long term renal replacement , mortality patient acute renal failure substantially great develop renal dysfunction1 . Cardiopulmonary bypass activate component non-specific immune system , lead generation compound contain oxygen free radical . A study 14 patient undergoing cardiac surgery find increase level serum lipid peroxidation product ( thiobarbituric acid reactive substance ) within 15 minute commencement cardiopulmonary bypass , return preoperative level follow morning . The total serum antioxidative capacity correspondingly decrease intraoperatively , remain decreased 24 hour postoperatively . A similar study total plasma antioxidant status show decreased level 72 hour postoperatively . It clear cardiopulmonary bypass cause oxidative stress depletion antioxidant capacity . N-Nitrosation oxygenate nitric oxide ( NO . ) solution previously show significantly inhibit strong scavenge ability NaBic presumably anion scavenge nitrosating agent . At physiologic concentration , NaBic scavenge peroxynitrite reactive oxygen specie generate nitric oxide . This may contribute reduction deleterious effect NO generate agent . NaBic therefore potential regulator NO-induced toxicity . NaBic consider safe set intensive care treatment often use treatment patient metabolic acidosis without discernible adverse clinical effect . NaBic increase pH-level buffering hydrogen ion , cause electrolyte balance shift , e.g . Potassium shift increasingly intracellular . Frequent control pH potassium level require prevent alkalosis hypokalemia . These adverse effect uncommon typically biochemical nature . Oxidative stress produce experimentally use hypertonic glycerol . Intramuscular injection hypertonic glycerol rat precipitate acute renal failure associate marked decrease renal reduce level antioxidative agent . Pre-treatment NaBic protective sodium chloride animal model acute renal failure secondary ischaemia doxorubicin . Radio-contrast dye commonly cause renal dysfunction , part oxidative stress kidney . While approved indication , intravenous sodium bicarbonate use successfully attenuate radiocontrast-induced nephropathy , effective standard intravenous fluid prophylaxis . Hydration NaBic contrast exposure effective hydration sodium chloride prophylaxis contrast-induced renal failure . By increase medullary pH kidney , NaBic might protect oxygen injury slow pH-dependent radical production . While never investigate effect renal function cardiac surgery , effect perioperative sodium bicarbonate system study . In clinical trial 15 infant mechanically ventilate immediate postoperative period corrective cardiac surgery sodium bicarbonate increase arterial pH , lower mean pulmonary arterial pressure increase cardiac index result decrease pulmonary vascular resistance . Infusion sodium bicarbonate result significant improvement skin microcirculatory perfusion observation study 15 patient undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass . The negative effect peroxynitrite cause oxidative stress tyrosine nitration neurodegenerative disorder strongly reduce presence sodium bicarbonate in-vitro experiment . There thus evidence sodium bicarbonate affect cardiovascular , respiratory immune system may benefit patient undergo cardiac surgery . Hypotheses Sodium bicarbonate administer time induction anaesthesia prior cardiac surgery 24 hour postoperatively result decrease change renal function measure serum creatinine change great 25 % baseline peak level within first five postoperative day . Secondary outcome measure include : - change serum creatinine great 50 % baseline peak level . creatinine clearance first postoperative day ; - length ventilation ; - ICU stay ; - hospital stay ; - serum creatinine level day 2 post-op ; - plasma antioxidant activity ; - NF-kB activation cellular component blood ; - pro-inflammatory cytokine response - Activation nitric oxide synthase pathway Study Design - overview rationale Patients randomise receive sodium bicarbonate 5 % dextrose induction anaesthesia 24 hour postoperatively , placebo ( vehicle ) ( 154mEq/L saline 5 % dextrose solution ) . Serum creatinine commonly use clinical indicator renal function along urine output . Both measure 48 hour postoperatively - time period renal impairment likely develop . A sensitive indicator renal dysfunction creatinine clearance . This measure first 24 hour postoperatively . The efficacy sodium bicarbonate prevent oxidative stress assess use measure total plasma antioxidant activity ( bathocuproine assay ) quantification 8-isoprostane level . Any renal effect sodium bicarbonate correlate level plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1 , IL-6 TNF-alpha ) , know associated oxidative-stress induce renal failure . Activation inducible nitric oxide production also associate renal failure , effect sodium bicarbonate nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression cellular component blood assayed real-time PCR . Nitric oxide production assess measurement plasma nitrotyrosine concentration . Assay nitrotyrosine superior traditional Greiss reaction ( measure nitrate nitrite derivative nitric oxide ) , nitrate nitrite undergo renal excretion , many patient alter renal function . At molecular level , many gene responsible stimulate oxidative stress regulate promoter NF-kB . The cellular component blood assayed NF-kB use establish ELISA technique . NF-kB cellular component blood also assay use real-time PCR . Randomisation The randomisation base random number generate computer . Once consent obtain , allocation either treatment Sodium Bicarbonate placebo organise independent person ( clinical trial pharmacist ) dispense cod infusion bag . This delivered anaesthetic staff look patient theatre , ICU nurse care patient postoperatively . Detailed protocol Immediately follow induction anaesthesia , prior first surgical incision , Sodium Bicarbonate administer dose 154mEq/L 5 % dextrose 60 min ( 3mL/kg/h ) follow continuous IV infusion 154mEq/L 5 % dextrose 23 hour ( 1mL/kg/h ) placebo ( 154mEq/L saline 5 % dextrose ) . Patients randomise receive placebo receive equivalent volume dextrose . The appearance dextrose solution sodium bicarbonate solution similar , mark infusion bag identify study number . A 24 hour urine collection begin immediately arrival ICU , allow determination creatinine clearance . This measured hospital clinical pathology laboratory . Clinical data record detailed investigator ICU research nurse . 20 ml sample heparinized blood take arterial line cytokine molecular analysis . Samples take immediately induction anaesthesia , arrival intensive care unit , 6 , 12 24 72 hour postoperatively . Immediately follow collection , blood centrifuge low speed separate plasma cellular component , store aliquot -70 degree prior batch analysis . Analysis plasma total antioxidant activity 8-isoprostane , IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha nitrotyrosine concentration perform use commercially available ELISA reagent kit ( Oxford Biomedical Research , Oxis Research , BioCore ) . The cellular component blood assayed NF-kB concentration use commercially available ELISA kit ( Oxford Biomedical Research ) , also iNOS NF-kB mRNAs use real-time PCR machine Applied Biosystems pre-developed assay reagent 18S endogenous control . The principal investigator experience similar technique . Statistics power calculation Using data available cardiac surgery database 2500 patient last 5 year , expect 50 % patient develop increase serum creatinine great 25 % baseline peak control group . Given minimal clinically important reduction proportion 30 % Sodium Bicarbonate group , 100 patient need 90 % power detect difference control intervention group alpha 0.05 . Data collection Data collection perform principal investigator , ICU research nurse ICU nursing staff . The following variable obtain : Code patient , gender age . Date admission ICU Operative procedure time cardiopulmonary bypass Preoperative assessment leave ventricular function Serum creatinine urea preoperatively , immediately postoperatively , 12 every 24 hour thereafter ( measured clinical purpose ) . Doses frusemide administer ( rate frusemide infusion ) Use inotropes Cardiac output whenever measure clinical purpose first 24 hour postoperatively Urine output 6 hour period 24 hour postoperatively Date discharge ICU hospital death Resources require The principle study discuss involved cardiac anaesthetist , cardiac surgeon , intensivists intensive care nurse , offer co-operation . ICU research nurse allocate patient collect clinical data . Pharmacy require prepare drug placebo infusion bag . Clinical pathology require perform 24 hour creatinine clearance estimation ( addition test clinically indicate ) Protocol violation All protocol violation record . It decide whether nature violation patient exclude primary data analysis . Such evaluation blind treatment . Withdrawal The treat clinician right withdraw patient study believe continued participation jeopardise patient 's well . Ethical Issues Sodium bicarbonate use study consider safe demonstrate widespread clinical use management critically ill patient metabolic acidosis . We consider potential benefit treatment theoretically significant . Given balance benefit risk , investigator consider ethical proceed seek inform consent . Indemnity This investigator-initiated study , accordingly , commercial sponsor 's indemnity provide .</detailed_description>
