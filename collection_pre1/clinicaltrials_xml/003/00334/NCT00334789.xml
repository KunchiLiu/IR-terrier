	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose belinostat give together isotretinoin treat patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor . Belinostat may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor block enzyme need cell growth . Isotretinoin may cause solid tumor cell look like normal cell , grow spread slowly . Giving belinostat together isotretinoin may effective treatment metastatic unresectable solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Belinostat Isotretinoin Treating Patients With Solid Tumors That Are Metastatic That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety feasibility combine PXD101 ( belinostat ) 13-cis-retinoic acid [ 13-cRA ] ( isotretinoin ) patient advance solid tumor malignancy . II . To define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) PXD101 administer combination 13-cRA describe toxicity dose study . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics PXD101 13-cRA give combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate upregulation retinoic acid receptor-beta ( RARÎ² ) retinoic X-receptor ( RXR ) expression tumor tissue treatment PXD101 13-cRA . II . To measure apoptosis tumor biopsy treatment . III . To assess change gene expression exposure PXD101 13-cRA . IV . To document clinical activity combination PXD101 13-cRA . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study belinostat . Patients receive belinostat intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1-5 isotretinoin orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos PXD101 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity first course therapy . Once MTD determine , expand cohort 10 patient enrol treated MTD . These patient also undergo blood collection periodically treatment pharmacokinetic study . All patient undergo blood collection , buccal scraping , tumor biopsy periodically biomarker , pharmacodynamic , gene expression , laboratory study . After completion study treatment , patient follow &gt; = 8 week .</detailed_description>
