	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving radiation therapy together chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give radiation therapy together chemotherapy bevacizumab work treat patient recurrent , unresectable stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate reduction toxicity , term pulmonary hemorrhage , patient recurrent , unresectable stage IIIB IV squamous non-small cell lung cancer treat radiotherapy follow paclitaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab . Secondary - Determine overall progression-free survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients undergo radiotherapy primary tumor , clinically involved lymph node , disease-causing symptom bronchial compression daily , 5 day week , 2 week week 1 2 . Beginning week 4 , patient receive paclitaxel IV 3 hour , carboplatin IV 15-30 minute , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment paclitaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab repeat every 3 week 4 course absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response , partial response , stable disease 4 course receive bevacizumab alone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 32 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
