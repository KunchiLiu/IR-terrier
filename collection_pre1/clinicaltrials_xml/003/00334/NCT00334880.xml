	<detailed_description>This study randomize , phase III , multi-center , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , force dose titration adult subject ( 18-55 year age inclusive ) ADHD randomize NRP104 ( 30 , 50 , 70 mg ) placebo four week double-blind evaluation safety efficacy . The study three phase : ( 1 ) screen washout ; ( 2 ) baseline ; ( 3 ) 4-week double-blind evaluation NRP104 placebo . The double-blind period include force dose titration phase follow fix dose phase . Subjects require visit site 6 time 5-8 week period , long case require 28-day wash . Screening Washout : Subjects screen establish eligibility study participation . The Screening Visit ( Visit 1 ) may take place multiple day need accommodate subject 's schedule . Those subject meet eligibility requirement undergo medication washout , applicable . The length ADHD medication washout period range 7-28 day . Baseline : Following medication washout , subject return clinic reassessment eligibility criterion establishment baseline measure . The interval first day Screening Visit ( inform consent date ) Baseline Visit ( Visit 2 ) must exceed 35 day . Eligible subject baseline ADHD-RS score great equal 28 ( perform use adult DSM-IV prompt ) randomize treatment . Double-blind treatment : Eligible subject randomly assign ( 2:2:2:1 ratio three active dos vs. placebo ) daily morning dose NRP104 placebo 4 week . All NRP104 group start dose 30 mg/day . Subjects randomize 70 mg titrate dose 2-week period ; randomize 50 mg titrate dose 1-week period ; randomize 30 mg begin dose 30 mg per day week one remain dose throughout study . Double-blind assessment safety efficacy NRP104 proceed 4 week weekly clinic visit schedule evaluation medication disbursement . Follow-up period : Subjects complete least 2 week double-blind participation , option continue participation open-label extension study ( Protocol NRP104.304 : one-year safety study ) . Subjects eligible choose participate extension study continue follow thirty day follow last dose study drug . A telephone contact ( contact person ) initiate research site collect new ongoing SAEs follow-up unresolved relate AEs Final Study Visit Early Termination ( ET ) Visit ( Visit 6 ) . If Principal Investigator determines AEs acceptably resolve , appropriate follow-up continue safety concern , opinion Investigator , resolve .</detailed_description>
