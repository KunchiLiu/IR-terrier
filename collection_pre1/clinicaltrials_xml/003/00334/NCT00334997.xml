	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Endoscopic surgery less invasive type surgery laryngeal cancer may fewer side effect improve recovery . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . It yet know whether endoscopic surgery effective radiation therapy treat laryngeal cancer glottis . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study endoscopic surgery see well work compare radiation therapy treat patient stage 0 , stage I , stage II laryngeal cancer glottis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Surgery Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage 0 , Stage I , Stage II Laryngeal Cancer Glottis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine feasibility conduct large phase III randomize study future , compare radiotherapy v endoscopic excision patient stage 0-II laryngeal cancer glottis . - Determine patient acceptability propose trial design . - Compare effect use dedicate head neck research nurse vs general nurse patient recruitment . - Refine outcome measure , include voice analysis quality life . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , multicenter , pilot study . Patients stratify accord participate center T stage ( Tis T1 v T2a ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo endoscopic excision via CO_2 laser cold steel . - Arm II : Patients undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , 3-4 week . Patients undergo vocal analysis baseline 6 month 1 2 year randomization . Quality life assess baseline , 1 year , annually 5 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Histologically confirm squamous cell carcinoma glottic larynx , include tumor anterior commissure Stage 0II ( Tis , T1 , T2a ) No clinical radiological sign nodal involvement No evidence distant metastases Airway anatomy suitable endoscopic excision PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Fit receive radical treatment either radiotherapy endoscopic excision Life expectancy â‰¥ 2 year No cancer past 10 year except basal cell carcinoma skin adequately treat carcinoma situ uterine cervix No vasculitic condition adversely affect radiotherapy No coexist medical condition would limit life expectancy Not pregnant PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : No concurrent chemotherapy No concurrent palliative treatment</criteria>
