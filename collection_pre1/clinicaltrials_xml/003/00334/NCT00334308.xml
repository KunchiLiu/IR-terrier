	<brief_summary>The Question pose : Does barley protein concentrate health benefit similar demonstrate soy protein food would justify use non-fiber component barley functional food ingredient ? Hypotheses : 1 . Cholesterol Lowering : There good evidence indicate soy protein lower serum cholesterol level . The evidence strong enough health claim coronary heart disease risk reduction approve FDA . In addition , find wheat gluten significantly reduce serum triglyceride level . However , need assess possible health benefit vegetable protein source . Barley grown relatively large amount Canada barley protein would readily available vegetable protein source health attribute could ascribe . In addition component barley , include plant sterol phenolic , may hypocholesterolemic antioxidant property . 2 . Antioxidant : In addition cholesterol-lowering possibly equal importance term prevention cardiovascular chronic disease , barley phenolic associate barley protein may add benefit antioxidant . 3 . Markers Inflammation : Barley component consider hypoallergenic . Hence use cosmetic industry . Auto-immune inflammatory response associate increase CHD risk . Barley protein consumption may therefore reduce level pro-inflammatory cytokine ; acute phase protein . 4 . Arterial Dilatation : Barley protein may also beneficial effect vascular reactivity may reduce CHD risk account high arginine : lysine ratio . Arginine enhance nitric oxide synthesis associate endothelial relaxation arterial dilatation . Barley may therefore increase pulmonary nitric oxide level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : The effect oat protein extract assess one-month feeding study forty healthy men woman raise serum cholesterol level . Two bread prepare , one control one provide 45 g/d barley protein feed one month randomize crossover design . Diets : The diet subject ' usual diet appropriately NCEP Step 2 diet patient treat without medication degree hyperlipidemia . Those NCEP Step 2 diet instruct accordingly . During first phase , two one-week record diet patient photocopy returned patient use dietary model subsequent period . We find approach effective stabilize diet soy protein study . Supplements : Will bread test control supplement provide identical daily energy intake . The increase protein barley supplement match use protein milk protein ( casein ) . Similarly increase polyunsaturated , monounsaturated saturate fatty acid test supplement match addition appropriate blend oil control . Baked good prepared clinic seven-day supply provide participant begin week . The exact formulation supplement involve product development , palatability test chemical analysis prototypes initial phase study . Compliance : compliance assess complete weekly diet record supplement intake record daily . These record review dietitian subject end week . In addition , uneaten supplement return , weigh note menu plan dietitian . Diet record also assess ensure predetermine diet plan follow accord phase one record diet .</detailed_description>
