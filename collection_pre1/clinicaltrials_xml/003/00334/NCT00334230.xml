	<brief_summary>This study , conduct collaboration National Rehabilitation Hospital ( NRH ) Washington , D.C. , look change brain activation brain response occur gait ( walk ) training . Brain images response healthy subject compare patient . Healthy normal volunteer people stroke within 3 month start study may eligible study . Candidates must 18 80 year age , patient must participate NRH 's walking study . Stroke patient participate three study session describe . The first session take place patient start NRH walk training study , second session take place completion NRH walking study , third session take place 3 month complete NRH study . Healthy control subject complete procedure session 3 . Session 1 Day 1 : Neurological examination questionnaire evaluate memory attention . Day 2 : Motor test transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . For test , wire coil hold subject 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action help position coil properly . The stimulation may cause twitch leg muscle , subject may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . Session 2 Day 1 : Functional MRI ( fMRI ) . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . The subject lie table slide scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . Scanning time varies 20 minute 3 hour , scan last 45 90 minute . Subjects may ask lie still minute time perform movement foot . Day 2 : motor test TMS . Session 3 Day 1 : fMRI Day 2 : motor test TMS</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : The purpose protocol study mechanisms underlying beneficial effect locomotor train hemiplegic patient . The locomotor training perform approve protocol already start National Rehabilitation Hospital ( NRH ) . The overall goal NRH protocol determine whether goal-directed , robotic-assisted gait training effective conventional gait training facilitating recovery stable walking pattern hemiparetic stroke patient . We use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) identify change neural network involve performance improvement associate locomoter training . The relative contribution somatosensory cortex ( SI , SII ) performance improvement study . SI SII key role store process sensory information . Activity somatosensory cortex significantly involve control sensory input relevant motor learn health disease . For example , stroke patient decreased sensation exhibit le recovery intact sensation . Sensory input think play crucial role performance improvement associate locomotor learn . Therefore , likely SI SII activity play major contributory role training-dependent locomotor improvement stroke . Electrophysiological measurement provide important insight sensorimotor integration process human . Indeed , cortical facilitation induce peripheral nerve afferent input useful probe sensorimotor interaction health disease . The specific hypothesis performance improvement locomotor train associate : ( ) increase sensorimotor integration express facilitation MEP size induce peripheral nerve stimulation , ( b ) great process somatosensory region , express increase fMRI activation ipsilesional SI SII .</detailed_description>
