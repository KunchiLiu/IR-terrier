	<brief_summary>The kidney highly vascular organ trauma surgery pose risk severe bleeding . Platelet function integral part blood clot initial , so-called vascular phase . So far universally accept , easy test available measure platelet function . Renal failure condition generally associate bleeding due platelet dysfunction . This study explore utility novel platelet function test , call Platelet Function Analyser-100 predict bleed percutaneous kidney biopsy . Platelet Function Analyser-100 measure kidney biopsy along routine blood test . Subjects undergo renal ultrasound renal biopsy verify post-biopsy bleeding event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does An Abnormal PFA 100 Predict Bleeding After Renal Biopsy ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many patient advance chronic kidney disease predisposition bleed . This predisposition become problematic undergo invasive procedure renal biopsy . There multiple factor play role predisposition bleed . These factor cause abnormal platelet function . Historically several test use assess bleeding tendency patient renal disease . The extensively studied bleeding time . Ideally best test difficult reproduce , insensitive , operator dependent time consume . Recognizing limitation bleeding time , Platelet Function Analyser-100 ( PFA-100 ) develop . This test attempt mimic way clot normally form body . The purpose study determine whether abnormal Platelet Function Analyser-100 , test determines platelet function , accurate predictor bleed chronic kidney disease . All patient admit renal biopsy offer enrollment study . Initial data include follow obtain : age , sex , weight , serum creatinine , activate Prothrombin Time/activated Partial Thromboplastin Time , Complete Blood Count Platelet Function Analyser-100 closure time . Participants place group ( cohort ) base calculated Glomerular Filtration Rate le 30 cc/min , Desmopressin [ Brand Name : DDAVP ] ( drug appear improve platelet function ) give . Post-procedure , participant monitor bleed obtain Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) 4 hour approximately 16 hour post-procedure monitoring urine blood . The pre- post-procedure hematocrit post biopsy renal ultrasound use determine whether abnormal Platelet Function Analyser-100 closure time predictive decrease hematocrit There additional risk participation study . This study would involve obtain additional blood would obtain blood would otherwise obtain prior renal biopsy . There direct benefit study enrol participant . Besides Platelet Function Analyser-100 blood test , patient undergoing renal biopsy undergo procedure post-procedure monitoring per standard care renal biopsy institution . Inclusion criterion : Will offer enrollment essentially patient undergo standard percutaneous renal biopsy University Medical Center . These : age 18-80 , Body Mass Index &gt; 35 , Modification Diet Renal Diseases ( DMDRD ) formula-based calculated Glomerualar Filtration Rate ( GFR ) &gt; 10cc/minute , Hematocrit &gt; 25 , platelet count &gt; 100 , normal aPT/aPTT , Exclusion criterion : essentially contraindication standard percutaneous renal biopsy ) know bleed disorder , history prior bleeding procedure know ongoing bleeding time procedure , Hematocrit &lt; 25 , Platelet count &lt; 100 , abnormal activate Prothrombin Time ( aPT ) /activated Partial Thromboplastin Time ( aPTT ) pre biopsy , small kidney ( ) &lt; 8.0 cm , multiple bilateral renal cyst mass , hydronephrosis , active urinary tract infection , recent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use . Risk : The Platelet Function Analyser 100 require additional 5-10cc blood drawn . No additional stick do since generally prior biopsy patient Complete Blood Count , aPT/aPTT chemistry draw . Possible benefit patient : There likely benefit individual patient . The Platelet Function Analyser 100 relatively new test determine platelet dysfunction limit study dialysis patient . However date , study chronic kidney disease . If correlation find abnormal Platelet Function Analyser bleed instead give patient compromise Glomerular Filtration Rate , desmopressin , abnormal Platelet Function Analyser would give desmopressin . In essence , would decrease patient incur expense hospitalization . This test may also point patient high risk bleed post renal biopsy may ultimately alter length hospital monitoring patient post biopsy . Other benefit test noninvasive , rapid require specialized training perform test . Alternatives : In lieu check Platelet Function Analyser 100 , bleed time could do demonstrated multiple study poorly correlate bleeding . The result bleeding time often vary difficult test reproduce . Currently , standard , acceptable , pre-renal biopsy platelet function test do Institution . Consent process : The patient enrol study already agree undergo renal biopsy reason hospital admission . They allow discus family member via phone present hospital feasible patient allow take consent home defer biopsy discussion . The investigator discussion Platelet Function Analyser 100 prospective participant prior renal biopsy perform . The discussion include risk benefit test perform . The patient allow ask question . If consent give Platelet Function Analyser-100 drawn . Cost : There significant increase cost . The reagent use test donate Department Pathology willing test without additional charge patient . Compensation participant : none . Data preservation analysis : The data obtain study available Principal investigator immediate study personnel . The data keep Principal investigator secure location indefinitely . The result Platelet Function Analyser test medical record result lab obtain hospitalization .</detailed_description>
