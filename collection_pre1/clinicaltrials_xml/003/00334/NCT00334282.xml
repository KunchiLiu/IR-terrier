	<brief_summary>To evaluate efficacy safety pazopanib compare placebo patient locally advance and/ metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . Approximately 350-400 eligible patient stratify randomized 2:1 ratio receive either 800 mg pazopanib daily match placebo . The study treatment continue patient experience disease progression , unacceptable toxicity death . Primary objective study evaluate compare two treatment arm progression-free survival . Principal secondary objective evaluate compare two treatment arm respect overall survival . Other objective overall response rate [ complete response ( CR ) + partial response ( PR ) ] , rate CR + PR + 6 month stable disease , incidence , severity causality adverse event serious adverse event . Safety efficacy assessment regularly perform patient . An Independent Data Monitoring Committee establish monitor safety course study evaluate interim efficacy data overall survival .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>A patient consider inclusion study follow criterion apply : Signed write informed consent . Diagnosis clear cell RCC predominantly clear cell histology . Note : cytology pathologic criterion confirm clear cell RCC . Patients tumor type interpret nonclear cell , e.g . papillary , exclude . Locally advance RCC ( defined disease amenable curative surgery radiation therapy ) metastatic RCC ( equivalent Stage IV RCC accord American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) stag . Note : If metastatic disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature must confirm histology cytology . Cytology pathologic criterion confirm clear cell RCC , use patient histologically confirm clear cell RCC confirm metastatic disease neoplastic nature . Must measurable disease , i.e . present least one measurable lesion per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . A measurable lesion define lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥ 20 mm use conventional technique , ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan . Note : Patient exclude baseline measurable lesion within previously irradiate area . Note : A patient must complete baseline disease assessment order eligible . Baseline head , chest , abdominal pelvic CT MRI scan must perform within 2 week prior first dose study medication ; baseline bone scan must perform within 3 week first dose study medication . Patients receive one prior systemic treatment locally advance metastatic RCC document disease progression document treatment discontinuation due unacceptable toxicity . This firstline systemic treatment must cytokine base . Note : The firstline cytokinebased treatment interleukin2 ( IL2 ) interferonα ( INFα ) monotherapy , IL2 combination INFα , IL2 and/or INFα combination chemotherapy , hormonal therapy exclude agent target angiogenesis pathway . Agents combination regimen give sequentially treatment sequence predetermine patient fail one agent prior start another . Note : Prior adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy permit exclude agent target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGF receptor . The adjuvant/neoadjuvant therapy consider firstline systemic treatment advance RCC . Or , Patients receive prior systemic therapy advanced/metastatic RCC enrol follow circumstance : Patients live country region establish standard firstline therapy advanced/metastatic RCC barrier access establish therapy sunitinib , sorafenib , IFNα IL2 . Patients live country region IL2 INFα approve treatment advanced/metastatic RCC , however , agent generally recognize local clinical community standard treatment advanced/metastatic RCC , physician patient determine available cytokine therapy acceptable therapeutic option . Patients recur follow prior adjuvant neoadjuvant cytokine therapy RCC eligible participate without receive firstline systemic treatment locally advance metastatic RCC . These patient stratify firstline population . Male female ≥ 18 year age . A woman eligible participate study : Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant ) , include female : Has hysterectomy , Has bilateral oophorectomy ( ovariectomy ) , Has bilateral tubal ligation , Is postmenopausal ( total cessation menses ≥1 year ) . Childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week first dose study medication , agree use adequate contraception . GSK acceptable contraceptive method , use consistently accordance product label instruction physician , follow : An intrauterine device document failure rate le 1 % per year . Vasectomized partner sterile prior female patient 's entry sole sexual partner female . Complete abstinence sexual intercourse 14 day exposure investigation product , clinical trial , least 21 day last dose investigational product . Doublebarrier contraception ( condom spermicidal jelly , foam suppository , film ; diaphragm spermicide ; male condom diaphragm spermicide ) . Oral contraceptive reliable due potential drugdrug interaction . A man female partner childbearing potential eligible enter participate study abstinent us barrier method contraception study . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status ( ECOG PS ) 0 1 Adequate baseline organ function define : Hematologic function : Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥1 x 10^9/L Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL Platelet ≥75 x 10^9/L Hepatic function : Total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 x Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) Aspartate Aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≥ 2 x ULN Renal function : Calculated creatinine clearance≥30 mL/min [ See Section 14.6 Appendix 6 ] ≥Urine protein 0 , trace , +1 determine dipstick urinalysis , &lt; 1.0 gram determine 24hour urine protein analysis . Note : A patient first screen dipstick urinalysis . If urine protein ≥2+ , 24hour urine protein must assess patient exclude 24hour urine protein is≥ 1.0 gram . Corrected serum calcium level within normal range per local clinical laboratory standard . Note : Patients hypercalcemia treat corrected serum calcium level reach normal range . At least 4 week must elapse since last surgery 2 week must elapse since radiotherapy last systemic cytokine therapy . Complete recovery prior surgery , and/or reduction AEs Grade 1 prior systemic therapy radiotherapy . Note : In patient prior radiotherapy , steroid dos stable decrease least 2 week . A patient eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Pregnant lactate female . History another malignancy . Note : Patients another malignancy diseasefree 5 year , patient history completely resect nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . History presence central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis leptomeningeal tumor document CT MRI scan , analysis cerebrospinal fluid neurological exam . Note : A baseline brain CT MRI scan must obtain patient within 2 week first dose study medication . Malabsorption syndrome disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , major resection stomach small bowel could affect absorption pazopanib . Unable swallow retain orally administer medication . Active peptic ulcer disease , inflammatory bowel disease , ulcerative colitis , gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation ; history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 4 week prior begin study treatment . History human immunodeficiency virus infection . Presence uncontrolled infection . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) prolongation define QTc interval &gt; 470 msec . History Class III IV congestive heart failure accord New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) classification . History one follow cardiac condition within past 6 month : Cardiac angioplasty stenting , Myocardial infarction , Unstable angina . History cerebrovascular accident within past 6 month . Poorly control hypertension [ define systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥140mmHg , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥ 90mmHg ] . Note : Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study entry . The blood pressure must reassess two occasion separate minimum 24 hour . The mean SBP / DBP value blood pressure assessment must &lt; 140/90mmHg order patient eligible study . History untreated deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) within past 6 month ( e.g . calf vein thrombosis treat ) . Note : Patients recent DVT treat therapeutic anticoagulating agent ( exclude therapeutic warfarin ) least 2 week eligible . Presence nonhealing wound , fracture , ulcer , presence symptomatic peripheral vascular disease . Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Any serious and/or unstable preexist medical , psychiatric , condition could interfere patient 's safety , obtain informed consent compliance study . Has take prohibit medication within 14 day first dose study medication . Current prior use investigational anticancer drug within 4 week start study .
