	<brief_summary>The purpose trial compare post-conditioning standard angioplasty ( 50/50 chance ) patient present acute heart attack take directly angioplasty procedure . Post conditioning procedure involve balloon inflation follow deflation series cycle appear show ( base early data ) decrease amount damage heart muscle compare standard angioplasty procedure . Hypothesis : For Subjects undergo direct PCI STEMI , post conditioning cycle balloon inflation/deflation within first minute follow re-establishment coronary blood blow , decrease amount irreversible myocardial damage assess delayed enhancement contrast CMR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Post Conditioning PCI Acute ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient suffer myocardial infarction , blood flow usually cease due plaque rupture lead thrombus formation vessel occlusion . The resultant entity know ST Elevation segment myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) significant health issue industrialize country . There 50,000 STEMI 's every year Canada 10 % patient die hospital another 10 % die within first year heart attack . The common problem however death , irreparable damage leave ventricle lead LV dysfunction subsequent heart failure arrythmias . Re-establishing blood flow promptly administer plasminogen activator ( lytics ) mechanically perform angioplasty possible lower mortality rate dramatically . Although reperfusion necessary , give rise entity know ischemia-reperfusion acutely re-establishing blood flow oxygen level heart detrimental effect . Clinically manifest no-reflow cause subsequent damage leave ventricle decrease beneficial affect early reperfusion PCI . The ischemia-reperfusion effect set molecular cascade event involve unfavorable interaction neutrophil , platelet endothelium , fairly well identify . Efforts pharmacologically block effect prove particularly effective . Post conditioning follow concept pre-conditioning animal show decrease myocardial infarct size . Pre-conditioning useful require perform prior development ischemia/injury . Post condition preliminary study animals one small study human show promising result decrease infarct size . Post conditioning procedure gradual conditioning artery open closed cycle inflation/deflation culprit artery follow immediately standard PCI placement stent .</detailed_description>
