	<brief_summary>Infants bear prematurely increase production primary red cell growth factor , erythropoietin ( Epo ) , often develop anemia call `` anemia prematurity . '' The anemia prematurity common anemia see neonate , due failure Epo production . Human recombinant Epo ( rHuEpo ) , give three five time week , successful treat anemia prematurity . A slightly modify , long-acting version rHuEpo , call darbepoetin alfa ( darbepoetin ) , available proven effective increase hematocrit ( red blood cell level ) adult . In addition red cell stimulate property , recent evidence show rHuEpo protective developing injured brain . We design randomize , mask , placebo-controlled study determine safety short long term efficacy darbepoetin . At time , darbepoetin study primarily adult pediatric patient , evidence pilot study darbepoetin would useful neonatal setting well . It also may well improve neurodevelopmental outcome preterm neonate . We hypothesize : 1 . The administration darbepoetin preterm infant 500 1,250 gram birth weight result increase reticulocyte count decrease transfusion compare placebo ; 2 . The administration darbepoetin associate increase mental developmental index 18-22 month compare placebo .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A novel erythropoiesis stimulate protein , Darbepoetin alfa ( Darbepoetin ) develop Amgen Inc. show effective increase hematocrit use weekly every week dose adult anemia due end stage renal disease cancer . However , presently evaluate use child hyporegenerative anemia , yet evaluate use infant anemia prematurity . Preterm infants respond human recombinant erythropoietin ( Epo ) increase reticulocyte , yet multiple subcutaneous dos diminish routine use NICU . With possibility week every week dosing , use Darbepoetin population appear promise . While likely use red cell growth factor rHuEpo darbepoetin eliminate need erythrocyte transfusion infant , reasonable postulate use darbepoetin eliminate need transfusion preterm infant , reduce need others . European study evaluate rHuEpo preterm infant successfully decrease donor exposure 1 per patient . Our goal achieve similar success , define donor exposure ≤1 donor per infant clinical practice . This achieve use red cell growth factor , judicious use blood work monitoring , stringent transfusion guideline . By decrease total transfusion &lt; 4 per infant , achieve goal ≤1 donor exposure per infant . There remain population extremely small , extremely ill infant phlebotomy loss exceed capacity increase red cell mass use Epo . Some investigator believe combination single donor erythrocyte transfusion recombinant erythropoietin serve maintain adequate circulate erythrocyte volume . A reasonable algorithm develop assist determination continue research . Continued critical evaluation transfusion criterion , outcome , new technology limit phlebotomy loss , novel biologic pharmacologic treatment serve improve care ELBW infants high risk repeat transfusion . Our research aim study safety efficacy darbepoetin preterm infant order improve outcome preterm infant significantly decrease number transfusion . Moreover , improve neurodevelopmental outcome preterm infant continue goal neonatal care provider might begin approach darbepoetin therapy . This study differ previous erythropoietin study follow way : 1 . Darbepoetin compare placebo rHuEpo , allow two third patient receive form red cell growth factor , allow SC dose occur week darbepoetin recipient compare usual three time week SC dose rHuEpo recipient ( placebo group receive sham injection ) 2 . Dosing begin 1-2 day earlier average previously publish study 3 . Transfusion guideline rigorous applied date , use site altitude &gt; 4,000 foot 4 . A target Epo concentration &gt; 500 mU/mL treatment group propose order evaluate neurodevelopmental difference group , study power determine difference treatment group placebo</detailed_description>
