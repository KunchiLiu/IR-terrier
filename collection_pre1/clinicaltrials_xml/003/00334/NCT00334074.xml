	<brief_summary>The purpose trial determine safety effectiveness therapeutic combination - Clofarabine Cytarabine treatment AML MDS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine Ara-C Treatment Relapsed AML Untreated MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study Clofarabine Cytarabine combination treatment adult AML MDS patient show promising result . This study do confirm finding previous study . Primary objective determine overall response rate ( complete response [ CR ] plus partial response [ PR ] ) ; secondary objective study characterize quantify toxicity profile associate clofarabine plus cytarabine treatment . A maximum 35 patient treat study . They receive 5 consecutive day clofarabine intra venous infusion ( IVI ) follow 4 hour later cytarabine IVI.Patients receive maximum 4 cycle study treatment . Next cycle start approximately 4 week Day 1 previous cycle.No investigational commercial agent include chemotherapy , radiotherapy , immunotherapy may administer patient enrol study intention treat underlying malignancy Patients remain study , monitor 4 month elapse begin date last cycle treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient least 18 year old histologically confirm disease follow : Standard poor cytogenetic risk acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) accord Southwestern Oncology Group ( SWOG ) criteria first relapse primary refractory status Untreated highrisk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) define &gt; 10 % blast Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) accelerate phase blast crisis fail imatinib therapy . Selected elderly patient untreated AML high risk anthracycline toxicity . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , Laboratory value obtain less equal 7 day prior receive study treatment : Total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dL unless elevate due hemolysis Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) /alanine transaminase ( ALT ) less equal 5 Ã— upper limit normal ( ULN ) Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL Capable understanding investigational nature , potential risk benefit study , able provide valid inform consent . Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week prior enrollment . Male female patient must use effective contraceptive method study minimum 6 month study treatment . Patients FAB M3 unless relapse treatment ATRA arsenic trioxide . Patients eligible receive curative allogeneic transplant determine performance status , organ function , availability match donor , etc . Current concomitant chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy . Use investigational agent within 30 day anticancer therapy within 3 week study entry . The patient must recover acute toxicity previous therapy . Active heart disease include myocardial infarction within precede 3 month . History severe coronary artery disease , arrhythmias atrial flutter fibrillation require medication , uncontrolled congestive heart failure Dyspnea rest minimal exertion . Patients active , uncontrolled systemic infection consider opportunistic , lifethreatening , clinically significant time treatment know suspected fungal infection ( ie , patient parenteral antifungal therapy ) . Pregnant lactating patient . Prior enrollment trial . Any significant concurrent disease , illness , psychiatric disorder would compromise patient safety compliance , interfere consent , study participation , follow , interpretation study result .</criteria>
