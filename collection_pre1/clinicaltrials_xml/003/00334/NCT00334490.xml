	<brief_summary>Post-operative pulmonary hypertension risk factor right ventricular failure increase cause morbidity mortality patient undergo high-risk cardiac surgery . Several treatment use treat reduce post operative pulmonary hypertension . Unfortunately none treatment approve use condition one ( inhale nitric oxide ) specific enough pulmonary hypertension cause dangerous low blood pressure rest body . Sadly , inhale nitric oxide difficult expensive use , cause lung damage . Sildenafil citrate quite specific lung vessel , easy administer easily cause low blood pressure area body . We hypothesize oral sildenafil 12.5mg decrease baseline ( pre-dose ) mPAP least 20 % compare placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Oral Sildenafil ( Viagra ) Decrease Mean Pulmonary Artery Pressure After Cardiac Surgery ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sildenafil citarte selective pulmonary vasodilator without profound effect systemic hemodynamics make attractive option treat post operative pulmonary hypertension cardiac surgical patient . It inexpensive feasible administer . Intravenous well oral dos show reduce mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( mPAP ) pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) animal model well clinical trial adult primary pulmonary hypertension child cardiac surgery . However , data exists support safety efficacy Sildenafil citrate adult cardiac surgical population . The purpose study investigate potential role Sildenafil citrate treat post operative pulmonary hypertension cardiac population .</detailed_description>
