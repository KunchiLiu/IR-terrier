	<brief_title>Etanercept Hidradenitis Suppurativa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hidradenitis suppurativa disorder unknown etiology . Various hypothesis implicate obesity , diabetes mellitus , genetic predisposition tight clothe probable contribute factor . Although patient present suppuration lesion , typical furuncle absent ( 1 ) . Administration antibiotic offer transient relief symptom whereas therapy like androgen , isotretinoin methotrexate fail disclose clinical benefit ( 2 ) . More thirty out-patients hidradenitis suppurativa follow clinic “ Immunology Infectious Diseases ” ATTIKON University Hospital Athens . None present diabetes mellitus CD4 cell count within normal limit . However , test function monocyte often abnormal . This test involve isolation monocyte ex vivo release pro-inflammatory cytokine without stimulation bacterial endotoxins lipoteichoic acid . Results show increased baseline secretion poor response monocytes stimulation . Case report limited number patient disclose clinical benefit anti-TNF drug ( infliximab ) one two dos administration hidradenitis suppurativa . These report involve retrospective result five patient ( 3 ) single case ( 4,5 ) . The rationale administration etanercept hidradenitis suppurativa base follow data : ) etanercept proven effective management psoriasis consider skin disorder autoimmune background ( 6 ) ; b ) laboratory finding patient hidradenitis suppurativa point towards alter immune response adaptive immunity ( 7 ) . Tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) dominant cytokine inflammatory process rheumatoid arthritis . Elevated level TNF also find synovium patient psoriatic arthritis . Etanercept competitive inhibitor TNF-binding cell surface receptor thereby inhibits biological activity TNF . TNF lymphotoxin pro-inflammatory cytokine bind two distinct cell surface receptor : 55-kilodalton ( p55 ) 75-kilodalton ( p75 ) tumor necrosis factor receptor ( TNFRs ) . Both TNFRs exist naturally membrane-bound soluble form . Soluble TNFRs think regulate TNF biological activity . TNF lymphotoxin exist predominantly homotrimers , biological activity dependent cross-linking cell surface TNFRs . Dimeric soluble receptor etanercept posse high affinity TNF monomeric receptor considerably potent competitive inhibitor TNF bind cellular receptor . In addition , use immunoglobulin Fc region fusion element construction dimeric receptor imparts longer serum half-life . OBJECTIVE The objective study clarify potency etanercept therapy hidradenitis suppurativa . RATIONALE The rationale protocol base report beneficiary result case-patients administration anti-TNF drug ( infliximab ) separate case ground probable autoimmune predisposition disease .</detailed_description>
