	<brief_title>The Effects Eicosapentaenoic Acid ( EPA ) , Gamma-Linolenic Acid ( GLA ) Antioxidants Treatment Sepsis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effectiveness nutritional support modulate chain inflammatory response reduce demand respiratory system use nutritional intervention receive grow attention , result capacity interfere variety biological process [ 1 ] . Nutritional formulation low carbohydrate rich lipid may reduce minute-ventilation ventilatory demand , leading reduction respiratory coefficient CO2 production [ 2 ] . Gadek et al . [ 3 ] use high lipid enteral diet enrich eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA fish oil ) , gamma-linolenic acid ( GLA borage oil ) enhance level antioxidant vitamin patient ARDS , demonstrate significant improvement , PaO2/FiO2 ratio , also several outcome ventilator-free day , ICU-free day reduce new organ dysfunction . A recent clinical trial demonstrate use type diet may produce good outcome also patient acute lung injury ( ALI ) [ 4 ] . Recent pharmaceutical intervention propose sepsis seek focus regulating chain pro anti-inflammatory mediator [ 5,6 ] , responsible cause systemic characteristic disease , consequently , lead multiple organ failure . The inflammatory reaction capable activate synthesis lipid mediator , prostaglandin E2 , involve complex regulation inflammatory process [ 7 ] . Many inflammatory mediator metabolites omega-6 fatty acid , linoleic acid product elongation/desaturation , arachidonic acid [ 8 ] . Substitution Omega-6 fatty acid fatty acid rich Omega-3 , EPA , prove beneficial modulate inflammatory process animal model human [ 9-17 ] . Interest also grow around potential metabolic effect GLA . This oil rapidly lengthen dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid ( DGLA ) incorporate tissue lipid . DGLA may , amongst effect , suppress bio-synthesis leukotrienes , rapidly metabolize monoenoic prostaglandin [ 18 ] . In addition , although EPA allow elongation GLA DGLA , tend prevent desaturation arachidonic acid . This mechanism produce increase 1 series prostanoids decrease 2 series eicosanoids . Research use animal model sepsis-induced ARDS show diet low carbohydrate rich EPA GLA may modulate production inflammatory mediator , improve functional capacity lung . This type diet capable rapidly reduce phospholipid fatty acid content arachidonic acid inflammatory cell membrane [ 19 ] , even administer parenterally [ 20 ] . In animal model sepsis , diet enrich omega-3 fatty acid associate reduced mortality [ 21-24 ] . Moreover , recent study [ 25 ] demonstrate beneficial effect enteral diet enrich EPA , GLA elevate level antioxidant vitamin , patient severe sepsis septic shock require mechanical ventilation . In subpopulation patient , use enteral formulation enrich EPA , GLA Antioxidants associate improvement oxygenation status , reduce mechanical ventilation time , few day ICU , less new organ dysfunction also 19.4 % absolute risk reduction mortality ( NNT=5 ) . Since evidence literature point towards anti-inflammatory role EPA GLA ( 26 ) , also antioxidant vitamin alone ( 27-29 ) , difference group may explain effect EPA , GLA antioxidant , also combination . Although previously publish trial design investigate effect diet patient ARDS , certain difference prove particularly relevant . First , former study examines effect diet population ARDS patient constitute solely patient severe sepsis septic shock . Moreover , enrol patient PaO2/FiO2 ratio 200 , rather 250 , occur latter study . The heightened gravity patient use may contribute great number day require mechanical ventilation lower day outside ICU , compare previously publish result . Finally , study allow 6 hour moment patient fulfil entry requirement effective onset diet , rather 24 hour , lead significant reduction time necessary achieve 75 % BEE x 1.3 . Recent study show time-dependence determinant aspect treatment septic patient . For instance , PROWESS study [ 5 ] show significant reduction mortality severe septic patient high APACHE II score treat recombinant human activate protein C ( rhAPC ) first 48 hour fulfillment study entry criterion . Nevertheless , ENHANCE study show septic patient treat rhAPC first 24 hour meet inclusion criterion low mortality patient treat 24 hour , within first 48 hour . The early use also associate low consumption hospital resource include mechanical ventilation use vasopressor [ 30 ] . Time-dependency also associate several recommendation management septic patient [ 31 ] . Another important finding recent trial number patient develop new organ failure observe baseline , considerably low group receive study diet . This reduction demonstrate trend towards low evolution multiple organ dysfunction patient fed EPA+GLA+Antioxidants . If consider development multiple organ dysfunction associate increase mortality rate , hypothesize may determine factor reduce mortality rate [ 32 ] . This also suggest diet may develop important role patient early stage sepsis , prevent evolution disease severe sepsis septic shock . On hand , hyperglycemia insulin resistance common critically ill patient , even glucose homeostasis previously normal . Increased gluconeogenesis , despite abundantly release , probably central disruption glucoregulation [ 33,34 ] . Strict maintenance normoglycemia intensive insulin therapy show reduce intensive care hospital mortality morbidity critically ill adult patient [ 35 ] . Supplements tube feed use standard nutritional formulation significantly compromise glycemic control [ 36-39 ] , probably due rapid efficient absorption liquid . This specially relevant individual overt diabetes stress-related glucose intolerance , occur septic patient . In individual use standard nutritional formulation may complicate attempt achieve maintain normoglycemia . The answer matter may remain use enteral diet high lipid low carbohydrate . The scope clinical study evaluate possible role enteral formulation enrich EPA , GLA Antioxidants patient diagnose early stage sepsis despite pulmonary failure , well impact diet upon glycemic control capacity prevent development sepsis severe sepsis septic shock .</detailed_description>
