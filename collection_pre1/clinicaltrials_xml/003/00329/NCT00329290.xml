	<detailed_description>Title Project : Evaluation Maternal Fetal Outcomes Pregnancies Women Prosthetic Heart Valves Specific Aims Purpose Descriptive Study - Evaluate outcome pregnancy woman mechanical/bioprosthetic heart valve . - Identify risk pose mother fetus treatment various method anticoagulation pregnancy . Hypothesis Expected Outcomes Patients prosthetic heart valves pregnancy constitute extremely high risk group adverse maternal perinatal outcome . The study expect review possibly guide anticoagulation issue , risk associate various therapeutic option , i.e . coumadin vs. unfractionated heparin vs. low molecular weight heparin . In addition , study provide information possibly suggest optimal way manage patient . Background Significance : The ability diagnose surgically repair poorly functioning heart valve yield significant population woman childbearing age mechanical/ bioprosthetic heart valve . The clinical management pregnant woman artificial heart valve pregnancy difficult . Currently control clinical trial provide guideline safe effective anticoagulation . Current review literature show oral anticoagulation warfarin implicate cause significant fetal morbidity include prematurity , decrease birth weight , birth defect ( i.e . : `` warfarin embryopathy '' ) , abortion , still birth neonatal mortality . Warfarin embryopathy refers characteristic anomaly ( nasal hypoplasia , eye defect , hypoplasia extremity , deafness , mental developmental retardation ) , may occur coumadin use first trim and/or use dos &gt; 5mg per day pregnancy . It also report intravenous subcutaneous heparin sufficiently effective lower maternal morbidity mortality . Thromboembolic event , valve dysfunction lead peripartum valve replacement , maternal death observe . Inclusion Criteria : - Females prosthetic heart valve/s become pregnant surgical valve replacement . - Complete medical information ( medical history , surgical history , medication history , prosthetic heart valve information , anticoagulation history , obstetrical history , delivery history , fetal outcome , complication ) obtain patient ' record and/or patient ' physician . Exclusion Criteria : - Patients sufficient information obtain either medical record physician . - Patients give write consent . Research Design Methods : The survey conduct three phase : Physicians respond : Phase 1 : A questionnaire ask physician whether cared patient prosthetic heart valve year 1990 mail , fax e-mailed member Society Maternal Fetal Medicine . Phase 2 : Responding physician provide information investigator contact patient ( spouse/next kin patient decease ) , obtain telephone/signed consent form ( approve LBMMC IRB ) participate study release medical record investigator . Phase 3 : Data collect investigator review medical record interview refer physician patient . In event patient authorize informed consent due death , lose follow-up , incapacitate illness , next kin reach , primary doctor ask provide necessary , relevant medical record without disclosure patient 's identity . Parameters use assessment patient ' demographic well maternal fetal outcome include enclosed form ( Form 2 ) . Telephone interview , need , do patient 's convenience . Data Storage Confidentiality : Research data store office . All information obtain connection study remain confidential . If result study publish presented meeting , identity subject disclose . Potential Benefits Subject : Although information may immediate benefit patient , data collect may help medical community develop effective guideline selection prosthetic valve woman childbearing age care patient prosthetic heart valves pregnancy . Therapeutic Alternatives : The alternative participate study . Clinical Significance : This study could provide information regard maternal fetal risk associate pregnancy woman prosthetic heart valve . This information useful risk assessment prior pregnancy well management patient pregnancy , especially regard appropriate anticoagulation .</detailed_description>
