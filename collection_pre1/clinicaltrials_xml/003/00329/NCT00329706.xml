	<brief_summary>A brain PET scan recognize `` reasonable necessary '' patient `` recently establish diagnosis dementia '' ( Centers Medicare Medicaid Services , Decision Memo CAG-00088R , 2004 ) , evidence less clear patient less severe cognitive problem . A substantial portion patient develop Alzheimer 's disease form dementia , affect million people U.S. , cost u $ 100 billion annually . This project employ prospective randomize protocol determine whether PET scan help distinguish patient early Alzheimer 's change brain cause cognitive impairment accurately do current clinical practice alone , lead earlier , effective therapy extend patient ' ability think function independently .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>People experience mild cognitive change represent epidemiologically major segment geriatric patient population . In present proposal , aim measure knowledge cerebral metabolic information 1 ) influence work diagnosis management patient evaluate symptom early cognitive decline , 2 ) impact upon long-term clinical outcome , particularly subject metabolic pattern consistent presence Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) -like change brain . A total 710 patient suffer documentable decline cognitive function absence overt dementia study nine U.S. institution extensive experience infrastructure place evaluation Alzheimer 's disease related disorder , neuroimaging . In prospective , investigation , subject undergo baseline neuropsychologic test neuroimaging MRI FDGPET . PET scan report seal randomized respect whether release patient ' manage physician time interpretation , two year time scan perform . Working diagnosis manage physician record , treatment decision make manage physician patient . Cognitive ability , functional status , utilization healthcare resource , clinical social contact parameter assess every six month . Our major hypothesis among patient whose PET result immediately convey refer physician , diagnose management plan positively affect , lead effective utilization healthcare resource maintenance cognitive functional ability higher level . This project also provide rich source data use address question outside major focus ( e.g. , prognostic accuracy volumetric MRI data use instead , conjunction , FDG-PET data ; incremental predictive value apply statistically parameterizing and/or quantify software tool image data ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cognitive deficit and/or personality change present , observable physician and/or close contact ( ) patient ; absence , patient provide clear history decline patient 's physician deems reliable . If history neurologic exam reveals find suspicious stroke , tumor , bleed , ictal activity , hydrocephalus , CT/MRI appropriate neurological neurosurgical consultation must obtain . Standard history , physical , laboratory screen perform identify possible presence depression , substance abuse , malnourishment , medication effect interaction , cardiopulmonary compromise , electrolyte/calcium imbalance , anemia , hypoxemia , infection , thyroid dysfunction , renal dysfunction , hepatic dysfunction , glucose dysregulation . Any positive finding reveal 2 ) 3 ) appropriately treat , wherever possible , cognitive/behavioral deficit persist posttherapy . Subjects age 65 recruit , order enhance clinical relevance project focus age group serious concern early sign symptom senile onset dementia typically emerge . Overt dementia , discuss . Cognitive dysfunction impair subject 's ability perform activity daily live . Present past history thyroid disease ( due effect disease thyroid hormone replacement therapy brain metabolism others begin identify , remain incompletely characterize . ) Claustrophobia metal body condition would preclude PET MRI acquire , visual , auditory motor deficit would preclude accurate neuropsychological testing . Cholinesterase inhibition therapy already initiate .</criteria>
