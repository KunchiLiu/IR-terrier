	<detailed_description>Sunitinib malate design block pathway control important event growth blood vessel essential growth cancer . Hormonal treatment use low testosterone level body prostate cancer cell need testosterone survive . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your complete medical history record . You physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , temperature , weight ) . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . You computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan , bone scan , chest x-ray evaluate status disease . You ask medication treatment currently take . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) echocardiogram . An echocardiogram us sound wave make picture heart , help show well heart pump blood . You ask lie left side technician place probe gel chest create image heart determine function size . Your ability perform daily activity also evaluate . You bone marrow aspirate biopsy . To collect bone marrow aspirate biopsy , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . If find eligible take part study , take sunitinib malate mouth 1 time day 30 day together hormonal ablation therapy . You receive hormone injection low level testosterone blood . Hormonal therapy may give either monthly 3 month single 3-month dose . Every 30 day consider study `` cycle . '' You may receive 3 cycle treatment . On Day 1 cycle , physical exam ask medical history . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You ask medication take side effect may experience . You ask question ability perform daily activity ( performance status evaluation . ) On Day 15 Cycle 1 , ask side effect experience . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine testing . After complete 3 cycle treatment , surgery remove prostate . The surgery occur 1-2 week receive last dose study drug . After last dose study drug , follow-up visit . You ask side effect experience physical exam . You also digital rectal exam . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You also echocardiogram . An echocardiogram us sound wave make picture heart , help show well heart pump blood . You ask lie left side technician place probe gel chest create image heart determine function size . You follow-up visit , 28 day stop treatment . You physical exam complete medical history record . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You ask medication take side effect may experience . You performance status evaluation . You echocardiogram abnormal last visit . About 3 month surgery , return another follow-up visit . You physical exam complete medical history record . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You performance status evaluation . For first year surgery prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) blood test every 3 month . Two ( 2 ) year surgery begin PSA test every 6 month . This investigational study . Sunitinib malate authorize FDA research purpose . About 64 patient take part study . All enrol M. D.
