	<criteria>Male female subject , age 18 79 , inclusive A female eligible enter participate study : 1 . Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal ) ; , 2 . Childbearing potential , negative result require pregnancy test prior randomisation , agree acceptable contraceptive method . Subjects diagnosis idiopathic RLS use RLS Diagnostic Clinical Interview International RLS Study Group ( IRLSSG ) Diagnostic Criteria Screening Visit . Subjects RLS symptoms history minimum 15 RLS episode previous month . If possible due subject previous medication treat RLS investigator ensure subject experienced 45 episode RLS symptoms last 7 day washout phase ( see ) . The subject must discontinue washout previous medication treatment RLS sleep prior Baseline Visit ( Day 0 ) . The minimum discontinuation period washout generally 5 halflives medication 7 consecutive evenings/nights medicationfree prior baseline , whichever long period . During Washout Screening Phase , RLS symptom must present least 4 last 7 night immediately prior Baseline Visit ( e.g. , combination evening /or night = 4 day ) . Subjects total score = 24 IRLS Rating Scale baseline ( Day 0 ) . Subjects RLS symptom cause significant sleep impairment base clinical judgment guide subject response Question 4 IRLS Rating Scale ( e.g. , ordinarily include response ( 3 ) severe ( 4 ) severe sleep disturbance ) Baseline Visit OR RLS symptom cause severe/very severe discomfort limb base clinical judgment guide subject response Question 1 IRLS Rating Scale ( e.g. , include response ( 3 ) severe ( 4 ) severe discomfort limb ) Baseline Visit ( Day 0 ) . Subjects must experience RLS symptom require treatment nighttime . Subjects must give write informed consent prior specific study procedure . Exclusion criterion : Subjects suffer augmentation and/ 'end treatment ' rebound RLS symptom baseline ( Day 0 ) . Augmentation define RLS symptom occur treatment occur earlier afternoon/evening , symptom severe treat , symptom start less time rest treatment , symptom involve part body , arm trunk . 'End treatment ' rebound describe worsen symptom baseline occur pharmacological treatment stop . Subjects previous history augmentation . Subjects exhibit intolerance ropinirole dopamine agonist . Subjects require treatment daytime RLS symptom ( daytime define 10:00 hour 17:00 hour ) . Signs secondary RLS ( e.g. , end stage renal disease , iron deficient anaemia pregnancy Baseline Visit ) . Subjects serum ferritin level &lt; 10 mcg/L ( ng/mL ) Screening Visit . Subjects suffer primary sleep disorder RLS may significantly affect symptom RLS ( e.g . narcolepsy , sleep terror disorder , sleepwalk disorder , breathe related sleep disorder ) . Subjects diagnose movement disorder ( e.g. , Parkinson 's Disease , dyskinesia , dystonias ) . Subjects medical condition could affect efficacy assessment clinically significant unstable medical condition present safety concern . These may include , limited , follow disorder : diabetes , peripheral neuropathy , rheumatoid arthritis , fibromyalgia syndrome , symptomatic orthostatic hypotension , severe cardiovascular disease , hepatic renal failure , pleuropulmonary fibrosis , major psychotic illness . Subjects clinically significant abnormal laboratory value , ECG , physical examination finding resolve time baseline examination ( Day 0 ) . Abnormal 12lead ECG finding include , limited , follow : myocardial ischemia , clinically significant conduction abnormality , clinically significant arrhythmia . Subjects diastolic blood pressure = 110mmHg = 50mmHg systolic blood pressure = 180mmHg = 90mmHg Screening Baseline Visit . Subjects history alcohol substance abuse within past year . Subjects take medication know induce drowsiness , affect RLS sleep discontinue prior Baseline Visit . These medication include follow : Atypical typical antipsychotic , anticonvulsant , opioids ( include propoxyphene oxycodone ) , anxiolytic , sedatives/hypnotics ( include benzodiazepine ) , lithium , oral neuroleptic , stimulant ( include methylphenidate ) , dopamine agonist ( include ropinirole ) , dopamine antagonist ( e.g. , typical neuroleptic , metoclopramide ) , levodopa/carbidopa , clonidine , sedate antihistamine ( e.g. , chlorpheniramine , diphenhydramine , hydroxyzine ) preparation contain antihistamine . The minimum discontinuation period generally 5 half live 7 consecutive evenings/nights medication free , prior baseline , whichever long period . Exceptions general rule : fluoxetine , monoamine oxidase inhibitor : 4 week . For subject enter 40week , openlabel treatment phase , GSK Medical Monitor contact discuss individual case adherence may occur . Withdrawal , introduction , change dose hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) and/or drug know substantially inhibit CYP1A2 ( e.g. , ciprofloxacin , cimetidine , fluvoxamine , HRT ) induce CYP1A2 ( e.g. , tobacco , omeprazole ) within 7 day prior enrolment . Subjects already agent may enrol , must remain stable dos agent 7 day prior enrolment followup visit end study . Night worker others whose sleep habit incompatible study design , would require make significant change bedtime course study . Participation clinical drug device trial one month prior Baseline Visit . Subjects , opinion investigator , would noncompliant visit schedule study procedure . Women positive pregnancy test lactating .</criteria>
