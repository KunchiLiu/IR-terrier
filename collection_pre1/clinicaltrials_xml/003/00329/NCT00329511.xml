	<brief_summary>High blood pressure ( BP ) pregnancy call chronic hypertension ( CHTN ) , associate increase risk development pregnancy relate high BP call preeclampsia , preterm delivery , decrease growth fetus , fetal death , premature separation placenta uterus result damage fetus cesarean delivery . Longer duration severity CHTN pregnancy lead bad outcome mother fetus . Treatment mild CHTN pregnancy improve outcome , therefore , medication low BP use moderate severe hypertension . To date literature medication use pregnancy extremely limited . Methyldopa use first choice medicine CHTN pregnancy . It act central nervous system ( CNS ) relaxation blood vessel lead decrease BP . It decrease blood flow uterus , placenta , fetus ( 4 ) . Methyldopa weak antihypertensive medicine give three four time day frequently need change dose may require additional medication control BP . This may lead great chance non compliance . Another option Clonidine effective antihypertensive treatment available many form ( oral , parenteral , transdermal . ) It act maternal CNS . Clonidine associate teratogenic neonatal side effect . Transdermal clonidine ( catapres-TTS® ) preparation clonidine hydrochloride release absorb transdermally 7-day period . The study determine difference compliance two antihypertensive regimens- oral methyldopa Catapres-TTS , comparison patient tolerability , compliance adequacy BP control , well provide information alternate option BP control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Compliance Between Clonidine Patch Methyldopa Treatment Chronic Hypertension Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose Study : The purpose open-label randomized clinical trial compare clonidine patch ( Catapres-TTS® ) orally administer methyldopa ( Aldomet® ) 4-week period compliance pregnant woman 14 28 week gestation . In addition , study evaluate blood pressure ( BP ) control , patient tolerability , development side effect medication . Patients alternately randomize receive methyldopa ( standard care ) clonidine patch . Hypothesis : Clonidine effective antihypertensive agent similar mechanism action methyldopa . Transdermal clonidine may provide good compliance profile , adequate BP control , therefore , may use alternative methyldopa treatment CHTN pregnancy . Primary outcome study patient compliance . Compliance measure via patient diary , promptness keep appointment , pill/patch count visit . Overall compliance calculate 4 week study period add compliance point visit outline data sheet . Secondary outcome : 1 . Change mean arterial BP week 1,2,3,4 comparison baseline BP initial visit ( It use patient newly start medication patient uncontrolled BP baseline ) . 2 . Side effect medication report patient . Background Significance Chronic hypertension ( CHTN ) affect 1-5 % pregnancy . It define BP 140/90 high 20th week gestation beyond 12 week postpartum . CHTN associate increase risk preeclampsia , preterm delivery , intrauterine growth restriction , intrauterine fetal demise , placental abruption cesarean delivery . Mild hypertension define BP &lt; 150/100 mm Hg severe hypertension BP &gt; 160/110 mm Hg . There direct correlation adverse perinatal outcome duration severity CHTN pregnancy . Treatment mild CHTN pregnancy improve perinatal outcome , therefore , antihypertensive therapy reserve moderate severe hypertension . Methyldopa use first line therapy CHTN pregnancy . It central alpha-adrenergic agonist decrease peripheral sympathetic outflow thus result decrease peripheral resistance BP . It impact uteroplacental blood flow fetal hemodynamics . Methyldopa weak antihypertensive agent often time need increase dose , frequency and/or addition another medication optimize BP control advance gestational age . Side effect methyldopa include sedation , orthostatic hypotension , edema , weight gain , bradycardia , dry mouth . Rarely , aggravation angina , congestive heart failure , pancreatitis , colitis , hyperprolactinemia , bone marrow depression , hemolytic anemia , false positive anti-nuclear antibody rheumatoid factor may see . The use various class antihypertensive medication pregnancy limit due potential teratogenic effect . Angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor contraindicate pregnancy . The use beta-blockers diuretic controversial , limited data calcium channel blocker pregnancy . Clonidine effective antihypertensive treatment available oral , parenteral , transdermal dosage form . Although oral parenteral form commonly employ short-term use hypertensive urgency , data regard use pregnancy lack . It act stimulate α2-adrenergic receptor central nervous system ( CNS ) , depress peripheral sympathetic nervous system outflow , thus lower BP . Clonidine associate teratogenic effect fetus . Reproduction study perform rabbit dose 3 time maximum recommend daily human dose ( MRDHD ) clonidine hydrochloride reveal evidence teratogenic embryotoxic potential . The pharmacokinetics clonidine pregnancy study . Clonidine cross placenta fetal concentration 0.89 maternal level . No neonatal side effect report . Clonidine metabolize liver excrete unchanged urine . Therapeutic level orally administer drug affect transit time small intestine presence food liquid gastrointestinal tract . Transdermal administration drug pass first-pass metabolism liver , require small dose achieve therapeutic effect , promote patient compliance . In addition , drug absorb skin constant rate eliminate peak trough associate oral administration . This may result steady BP control transdermal clonidine administration . This may benefit pregnancy gastrointestinal transit time significantly prolong due progesterone effect nausea vomit first trimester may limit use orally administer drug . In addition , one would expect improved patient compliance avoid repeat dose four time day schedule methyldopa . Transdermal clonidine ( Catapres-TTS® ) preparation clonidine hydrochloride release absorb transdermally 7-day period . Its side effect profile similar methyldopa include tiredness , lethargy , drowsiness , constipation dry mouth . Orthostatic hypotension occur 3 % patient oral administration report transdermal form . Skin reaction include redness , itching , darken skin may occur clonidine patch . Rarely , angioedema , atrioventricular block , chest pain , congestive heart failure , hepatitis , thrombocytopenia , urinary retention may occur . A study hypertension non-pregnant individual United Kingdom show 40 % patient start new antihypertensive drug compliant six month later . There data available compliance antihypertensive medication pregnancy , although anecdotal experience improve compliance medication pregnancy compare non-pregnant state . Our study determine difference compliance two antihypertensive drug , provide additional comparison patient tolerability adequacy BP control . This may particular value pregnant woman unable tolerate oral feed e.g . hyperemesis gravidarum , immediate postoperative period . In addition , provide information alternate option BP control , describe obstetrical literature . 1 . National High Blood Pressure Educational Program Working Group .
