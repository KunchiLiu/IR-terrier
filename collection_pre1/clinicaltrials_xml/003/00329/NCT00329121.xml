	<brief_title>Study Determine Safety Two Applications PEP005 Topical Gel Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma In Situ</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Squamous cell carcinoma ( SCCs ) common skin problem largely cause long term sun exposure . Current treatment include surgery , curettage/desiccation topical pharmaceutical therapy , often cosmetically disfigure . Non-invasive alternative therapy treatment SCC lesion thus research . Sap plant Euphorbia peplus use many year Australia `` folk '' remedy treat number skin condition . The active component Euphorbia peplus isolate make gel apply directly skin Peplin Ltd. To date , three well-controlled study PEP005 gel human complete . In first second complete study , sixteen ( 1st study ) sixty-four ( 2nd study ) patient receive one two application PEP005 0.0025 % 0.01 % 0.05 % vehicle gel actinic keratoses . In third complete study , sixty patient receive two application PEP005 0.0025 % 0.01 % 0.05 % vehicle gel superficial basal cell carcinoma . Results study show good tolerance evidence activity . The current study design evaluate efficacy safety two application 0.05 % PEP005 gel patient SCCIS extremity , trunk face . Approximately 24 patient plan include multiple Australian center . Patients two visit treatment application return check-up visit day first application several time thereafter 2-3 month .</detailed_description>
