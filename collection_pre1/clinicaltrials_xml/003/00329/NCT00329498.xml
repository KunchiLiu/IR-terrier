	<brief_title>L-Ascorbic Acid Depletion Treat Acute Myeloid Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The seminal discovery vitro growth malignant cell could absolutely dependent L-ascorbic acid ( LAA ) originally publish Sciene . The cell culture assay use mouse plasmacytoma model discovery base colony formation , essentially one used grow normal hemopoietic colony , CFU-GM CFU-G , normal bone marrow specimen . Subsequent analysis growth factor CFUs use culture system eventually lead discovery colony stimulate factor , GM-CSF G-CSF , widely use clinically . Human leukemia , specifically acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , cell colony also grow well culture system , show extensive cell biology study . In addition , cell patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , significant proportion progress AML behave similarly AML cell culture system . In particular AML MDS identical growth colony enhance addition LAA cell culture medium high proportion patient . The large volume vitro data thus generate , include correlation direct clinical relevance increasingly convince lower LAA level could potentially develop utilized treatment specific hemopoeitic malignancy . This particularly attractive view fact growth normal hemopoietic colony , CFU-GM CFU-G , never enhance LAA . Such absolute selectivity would predict lack clinical adverse hemopoetic event intervention lower LAA level . We also seemingly-contradictory data growth colony AML MDS patient could suppress addition LAA , infrequently sometimes profoundly . However , detail dose response analysis later clarify : low physiologic dose enhance high pharmacologic dos suppress formation leukemic colony . From therapeutic perspective , would great expectation depletion strategy supplementation , 1 ) leukemic suppression addition LAA often accompany mild suppression normal CFU therefore absolutely selective ; 2 ) LAA supplementation clinically test variety solid tumor , controversial outcome . Therefore , original protocol develop primarily accomplish lower LAA level , subsequent oral LAA supplementation use primarily prevent scurvy secondarily possible benefit . However , first patient strong indication antileukemic effect LAA depletion supplementation phase . Based encouragement , protocol amend formally alternate depletion supplementation , utilize intravenous ( IV ) administration LAA achieve high dose supplementation . With 17 subsequent subject treat , study safety efficacy cyclic manipulation LAA level demonstrate beneficial outcome high proportion refractory terminal patient AML MDS . Moreover , grow laboratory evidence produce provide molecular basis clinical outcome .</detailed_description>

There must clear acceptable reason receive standard treatment ( chemotherapy and/or stem cell transplantation ) ; standard treatment already give option exhaust evidence refractory disease . Prior treatment form allow provided potential residual beneficial effect patient treatment least 4 week , estimate life expectancy least 2 month . Adequate amount ( 4 ml ) bone marrow send laboratory cell culture study . There restriction base age , sex , ethnicity except adequate contraception must practice woman childbearing age .
