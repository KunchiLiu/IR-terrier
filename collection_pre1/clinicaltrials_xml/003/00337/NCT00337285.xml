	<brief_title>An Open-label Study NRP104 Adults With Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-center , open-label , single-arm study ass safety three NRP104 dos ( 30 mg , 50 mg , 70 mg per day ) one ( 1 ) year treatment adult ADHD . Subjects randomize meet inclusion/exclusion criterion Protocol NRP104.303 eligible participation protocol . The study consist three period : screening/baseline period , 4-week dose titration , long-term maintenance 11 month . There three possibility subject rollover NRP104.303 protocol . They : Subjects rollover final visit NRP104.303 study ( day ) : The screen baseline procedure open label study coincide final study visit Protocol NRP104.303 . Subject data final study visit transfer utilized open label study . On day , subject consent NRP104.304 , inclusion/exclusion criterion assess , subject enrol , study medication dispense . Subjects rollover day within seven day NRP104.303 study : If subject return enroll NRP104.304 study within seven day final NRP104.303 study visit take excluded medication washout require , final study visit procedure data NRP104.303 study transfer utilized screening baseline visit procedure study , applicable . When subject return site , consent , inclusion exclusion criterion assess , subject enrol , study medication dispense . Subjects require full screening visit 7 day elapse since complete NRP104.303 study : After screen result receive site , site personnel contact subject via telephone inform continue study eligibility . During call subject instruct stop medication treatment ADHD , . This call start washout psychoactive medication , last 7 ( ±2 ) day . During Washout Phone Contact , visit date Baseline visit ( Visit 01 ) Visits 02 05 schedule 7-day interval calculate Baseline . After washout complete , subject return clinic baseline visit ( Visit 01 ) baseline procedure perform receive study medication . Dose Titration All subject initiate treatment NRP104 30 mg 1st week . At subsequent 4 weekly visit ( Visits 02 , 03 , 04 , 05 ) , subject 's daily dose NRP104 may increase decreased 20 mg weekly interval achieve optimal efficacy tolerability , deem appropriate Investigator . In study , maximum daily dose NRP104 receive subject 70 mg , minimum daily dose NRP104 subject must take continue treatment 30 mg . Monthly Maintenance At end initial 4-week dose titration ( Visit 05 ) , subject enter long-term maintenance 11 month . Monthly visit , start Visit 06 , window ±4 day . All visit schedule relative Baseline Visit date . The last scheduled visit protocol Visit 16 Month 12 . During long-term maintenance , subject 's dose may increase decrease 20 mg visit , deem appropriate Investigator , maintain optimal treatment term efficacy tolerability . All reason dose change well document investigator maintenance period . Subjects maintain minimum daily dose NRP 30 mg due intolerance withdrawn study . Safety Efficacy Assessments ADHD Rating Scale ( ADHD-RS ) perform use adult prompt Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) assess Investigator . The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) assess every three month follow baseline . Adverse event concomitant medication record visit start baseline visit . Vital sign measure visit screen visit . Physical exam clinical laboratory test ( include pregnancy test ) assess Screening , Visit 10 final visit . Weight measure screen visit , baseline visit , every month thereafter . Height measure screen visit final visit . ECG parameter assess screen visit , baseline visit , every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
