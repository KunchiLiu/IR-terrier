	<brief_summary>Patients advance chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) poor long-term prognosis . Allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) patient CLL rarely perform past clinical outcome myeloablative conditioning poor , mainly due high treatment-related mortality . However long-term disease-free survival allogeneic SCT report . Recently demonstrate group others non-relapse mortality reduce significantly use reduced-intensity conditioning regimen . Yet , graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) remain important problem setting . Alemtuzumab effective drug treatment patient advance CLL successfully apply GVHD-prophylaxis set myeloablative reduced-intensity conditioning regimen . The goal present study evaluate role alemtuzumab part fludarabine-based reduced intensity condition regimen allogeneic SCT patient advance CLL .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients relapse refractory CLL eligible study receive cytoreductive therapy SCT . Irrespective formal response , patient proceed allogeneic SCT fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning . The use granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) -mobilized peripheral blood stem cell &gt; 3 x 10E6 CD34 cells/kg recommend , bone marrow &gt; 1 x 10E8 MNC/kg accept . GVHD-prophylaxis base cyclosporine A adapt blood level ( 150 200 ng/mL ) period three month . In Phase I study , alemtuzumab apply part condition regimen day 5 . In Phase II , alemtuzumab give cytoreductive pre-treatment last application alemtuzumab schedule day 14 Amendment II September 2006 schedule day 28 . Furthermore methotrexate give day 1 , 3 , 6. 11 project cumulative dose 45 mg/m2 . Subsequent immunosuppressive therapy depend occurrence GvHD , development chimerism , residual disease . Patients relapse residual disease ( minimal residual disease exclude ) suffer GvHD receive donor lymphocyte increase dosage . The initial dose 1 x 105/kg T-cells unrelated donor 1 x 106/kg match related donor . If GvHD develop within 6-8 week , next high dosage apply .</detailed_description>
