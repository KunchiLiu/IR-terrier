	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate . Hormone refractory evidence rise PSA : Patient must maintain androgen ablation therapy LHRH agonist ( stable dose least 8 week prior study entry ) , undergone orchiectomy Serum testosterone level require ≤ 50 ng/dl Patients receive prior hormonal drug therapy : Flutamide , nilutamide cyproterone acetate must stop least four week prior study drug administration progression must demonstrate since cessation ; Bicalutamide must stop least six week prior study drug administration progression must demonstrate since cessation Elevated rise PSA : Baseline PSA level ≥ 10 ng/ml Progressive rise PSA , define two consecutive increase PSA document previous reference value ( measure 1 ) . The first increase PSA ( measure 2 ) occur minimum 1 week reference value ( measure 1 . This increase PSA confirm ( measure 3 ) minimum 1 week . If confirmatory PSA value ( measure 3 ) less previous value , patient still eligible provide next PSA measure ( measure 4 ) find great second PSA value ( measure 2 ) .3 . Multifocal skeletal metastasis confirm bone scintigraphy within last 6 week Performance status : ECOG 02 Life expectancy : At least 6 month Laboratory requirement : Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥ 100 x109/L Haemoglobin ≥ 95 g/L Total bilirubin level within normal institutional limit ASAT ALAT ≤ 2,5 time upper institutional limit normal range The patient willing able comply protocol ( include maintenance patient diary ) , agree return hospital followup visit examination The patient fully inform study sign informed consent form Has receive investigational drug within 4 week prior administration radium223 , schedule receive one treatment posttreatment period Has receive chemo , immunotherapy , external radiotherapy within last 4 week prior administration study drug , recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier More one regimen previous cytotoxic chemotherapy Has receive prior hemibody external radiotherapy Has need immediate external radiotherapy Has receive systemic radiotherapy strontium89 , samarium153 , rhenium186 rhenium188 treatment bony metastasis within last year prior administration study drug Has start treatment bisphosphonates less 3 month prior administration study drug . Patients allow bisphosphonates provide patient stable dose ≥ 12 week administration study drug . Patients ≤ 4 week ( 6 week bicalutamide ) post withdrawal antiandrogen therapy Patients start stop systemic steroid , within week prior study drug administration Other currently active ( relapse within last 3 year ) malignancy ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer ) prostate cancer metastases Visceral metastasis prostate cancer assess abdominal/pelvic CT MRI within six week administration study drug ; Lung lesion prostate cancer assess chest Xray within 6 week . This requirement include abdominal pelvic lymph node involvement ( individual lymph node size must exceed 1 cm short diameter ) acceptable Bulky locoregional disease Any serious illness medical condition , example : uncontrolled infection patient clinical heart failure severe enough cause mark limitation activity , comfortable rest ; patient heart failure severe ( NYHA Heart Failure Class III IV Crohns disease ulcerative colitis</criteria>
