	<brief_summary>The standard treatment PTCL CHOP ( cyclophosphamide ( C ) , adriamycin ( H ) , vincristine ( O ) , prednisone ( P ) ) chemotherapy . This study attempt determine whether add treatment CHOP therapy improve chance disease go remission stay remission . Because drug T-cell lymphoma yet give CHOP , study look combine CHOP ONTAK . ONTAK FDA approve treatment Cutaneous T cell Lymphoma work specifically binding protein surface tumor cell kill cell without cause damage type cell body . Studies show ONTAK help patient PTCL fail chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
