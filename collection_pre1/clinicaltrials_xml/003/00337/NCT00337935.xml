	<brief_title>A Study Use PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Treatment Anemia People With Chronic Kidney Disease Who Live Long-term Care Facilities .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) brand recombinant human erythropoietin ( rHuEPO ) . Erythropoietin hormone produce kidney . Its function stimulate production red blood cell bone marrow . Many patient Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) produce enough erythropoietin thus develop anemia ( reduction red blood cell level ) . This cause feel tire . PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment anemia ( low red blood cell count ) patient CKD ( dialysis ) . The approved dosing frequency PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) patient CKD one injection three time per week . Although PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) approve FDA treatment certain type anemia different dosing schedule , dose schedule use study investigational CKD . An investigational use one currently approve FDA . This open-label , randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , multi-center , control study patient anemia Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) , dialysis , reside long-term care facility . Approximately 156 patient CKD , dialysis , receive erythropoietin receptor agonist ( drug stimulates red blood cell production ) eight week immediately prior screening ( Week -1 ) hemoglobin ( Hb , measure number red blood cell ) , less 11 g/dL screen eligible participate . Patients evaluated eligibility one-week screening phase . Eligible patient randomize 3:1 ratio PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) group control group period 26 week . Randomization do computer randomly assigns subject chance ( like roll dice ) one two group ( No one choose group assigned. ) . They 3 1 chance assign Group 1 versus Group 2 , mean every 4 patient enter study 3 receive PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 1 . Group 1 -will receive PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 20,000 Units ( U ) every 2 week hemoglobin reach 11.0 g/dL high remain level two measurement row . At Week 6 thereafter , 20,000 Unit dose may adjust upward downward require obtain two consecutive hemoglobin measurement . Once two consecutive measurement achieve , PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) give every 4 week ( Q4W ) double previous dose obtain target hemoglobin 12.0 g/dL . There conversion Q4W Week 6 Week 18 . If hemoglobin drop , patient may go back receive PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) every 2-weeks . If hemoglobin rise 12.0 g/dL , patient receive another dose PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) Hg level 12.0 g/dL . If hemoglobin rise rapidly , patient receive another dose PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) rise 1 g/dL less 2-week period . The maximum amount PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) group receive 60,000 Units 4-week period . All dos PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) inject skin ( subcutaneous ) . Group 2 - receive PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) . This group continue receive care receive physician physician review lab result . Since lack iron could interfere ability patient make red blood cell , patient group iron level check screen visit study . Based result iron test , study doctor may prescribe oral ( mouth ) intravenous ( injection ) iron supplement study . If need iron supplementation determine , patient receive iron supplementation matter group . Every two week study visit perform . At visit , blood pressure heart rate check , blood drawn patient send central laboratory complete blood count ( CBC ) . The Hb CBC use efficacy analysis ( measure effectiveness study drug increase hemoglobin level ) . Hb test HemoCue perform every two week on-site PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) group patient , purpose real-time dosing decision . ( HemoCue brand name portable hemoglobin test use drop blood obtain immediate hemoglobin measurement ) . PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) administer dose base HemoCue Hb measurement . Full hematology panel , serum chemistry , iron status assess interval throughout study central laboratory . The number unit pack red blood cell ( PRBC ) transfuse , pre-transfusion Hb level , reason transfusion collect . Hemoglobin response also measure . A patient exhibit hemoglobin response two consecutive Hb measurement least 1 g/dL great baseline time study two consecutive Hb measurement &gt; = 11.0 g/dL time study . Falls , activity daily live ( ADLs ) , mobility assess study . Clinical laboratory result , blood pressure heart rate , incidence severity adverse event monitor study . The study hypothesis mean Hb change baseline end study significantly high PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) group control group . Group 1 patient receive maximum 13 dos PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) subcutaneous injection ( skin ) 26 week . Dosage base hemoglobin measurement do visit . Doses start every 2-week interval may increase every four week . The maximum dose give 60,000 Units PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 4-week period . Any PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) dose 40,000 Units administer two separate injection .</detailed_description>
