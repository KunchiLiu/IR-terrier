	<criteria>1 . Female patient histologically cytologically confirm carcinoma breast . Every effort make ensure paraffin embed tissue slide diagnostic biopsy surgical specimen available confirmation diagnosis . 2 . Patients locally advance metastatic disease receive three prior chemotherapy regimen , two prior regimen advance and/or metastatic disease . Regimens must include anthracycline ( e.g. , doxorubicin , epirubicin ) taxane ( e.g. , paclitaxel , docetaxel ) , either combination separate regimen . Patients know human epidermal growth factor 2 ( HER2/neu ) overexpressing tumor may additionally treat trastuzumab center treatment available . Patients know estrogen and/or progesterone receptorexpressing tumor may additionally treat hormonal therapy . 3 . Resolution chemotherapy radiationrelated toxicity Grade 1 severity low , except stable sensory neuropathy &lt; = Grade 2 alopecia . 4 . Age &gt; = 18 year . 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 . 6 . Life expectancy &gt; = 3 month . 7 . Adequate renal function evidence serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 50 mL/minute ( min ) per Cockcroft Gault formula . 8 . Adequate bone marrow function evidence absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1.5 x 10^9/L , hemoglobin &gt; = 10.0 g/dL ( hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 g/dL acceptable correct growth factor transfusion ) , platelet count &gt; = 100 x 10^9/L . 9 . Adequate liver function evidence bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) alkaline phosphatase , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) , aspartate transaminase ( AST ) &lt; = 3 x ULN ( case liver metastasis &lt; = 5 x ULN ) , case bone metastasis , liver specific alkaline phosphatase &lt; = 3 x ULN . 10 . Patients willing able complete EORTC ( European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ) quality life questionnaire ( QLQC30 breast cancer module QLQBR23 ) record pain level Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . 11 . Patients willing able comply study protocol duration study . 12 . Written inform consent prior studyspecific screening procedure understand patient may withdraw consent time without prejudice . 1 . Patients receive three prior chemotherapy regimen disease , include adjuvant therapy , patient receive two prior chemotherapy regimen advance disease ( therapy allow e.g. , antiestrogens , trastuzumab radiotherapy ) . 2 . Patients receive capecitabine prior therapy disease . 3 . Patients receive chemotherapy , radiation , biological therapy within two week , hormonal therapy , within one week study treatment start , investigational drug within four week study treatment start . 4 . Radiation therapy encompass &gt; 30 % marrow . 5 . Prior treatment mitomycin C nitrosourea . 6 . Pulmonary lymphangitic involvement result pulmonary dysfunction require active treatment , include use oxygen . 7 . Patients brain subdural metastasis eligible , unless complete local therapy discontinue use corticosteroid indication least 4 week start treatment study treatment . Any symptom attribute brain metastasis must stable least 4 week start study treatment ; radiographic stability determine compare contrastenhanced Computed Tomography Scan ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) brain scan perform screen prior scan perform least 4 week earlier . 8 . Patients meningeal carcinomatosis . 9 . Patients receive anticoagulant therapy warfarin related compound , line patency , change heparinbased therapy , eligible . If patient continue minidose warfarin , prothrombin time ( PT ) /international normalize ratio ( INR ) must closely monitor . 10 . Women pregnant breastfeeding ; woman childbearing potential either positive pregnancy test screening pregnancy test ; woman childbearing potential unless ( 1 ) surgically sterile ( 2 ) use adequate measure contraception ( consider two method contraception , one must barrier method , e.g . condom , diaphragm cervical cap ) . Perimenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential . 11 . Severe/uncontrolled intercurrent illness/infection . 12 . Significant cardiovascular impairment ( history congestive heart failure &gt; New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Grade II , unstable angina myocardial infarction within past six month , serious cardiac arrhythmia ) . 13 . Patients organ allograft require immunosuppression . 14 . Patients know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) status . 15 . Patients prior malignancy , carcinoma situ cervix , nonmelanoma skin cancer , unless prior malignancy diagnose definitively treat &gt; = 5 year previously subsequent evidence recurrence . 16 . Patients preexist neuropathy &gt; Grade 2 . 17 . Patients hypersensitivity halichondrin B and/or halichondrin B chemical derivative . 18 . Patients participate prior E7389 clinical trial . 19 . Patients significant disease disorder , Investigator 's opinion , would exclude patient study .</criteria>
