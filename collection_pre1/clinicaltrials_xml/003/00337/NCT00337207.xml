	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well bevacizumab work treat patient recurrent progressive glioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety single-agent bevacizumab treatment patient recurrent progressive malignant glioma . - Determine efficacy bevacizumab , term progression-free survival 6 month , patient . - Assess change tumoral blood flow base magnetic resonance ( MR ) perfusion tissue change MR spectroscopy . OUTLINE : This pilot study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 55 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
