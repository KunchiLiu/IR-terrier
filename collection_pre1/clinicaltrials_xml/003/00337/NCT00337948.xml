	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness safety epoetin alfa start dose 60,000 Units ( U ) every week ( QW ) target hemoglobin ( Hb ) 12 g/dL ( Initiation Phase ) , follow dose 60,000 U every week ( Q2W ) maintain Hb range 11.5 12.5 g/dL ( Maintenance Phase ) cancer patient receive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Every Week Every Four Weeks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epoetin alfa administer three time weekly ( 150 U/kg ) weekly ( 40,000 U ) result response rate ( define &gt; = 2 g/dL hemoglobin ( Hb ) increase Hb &gt; = 12 g/dL ) approximately 65 % anemic chemotherapy patient produce mean hemoglobin rise 1.8 g/dL . Higher weekly dosing may result high response rate timely mean hemoglobin rise remain safe . Additionally , limit data available show whether epoetin alfa maintenance therapy administer less frequently weekly still maintain hemoglobin level . This open label , multicenter , non-randomized study determine safety effectiveness epoetin alfa give cancer patient receive chemotherapy every week every four week . Patients receive 12 injection epoetin alfa 60,000 U every week ( QW ) subcutaneously ( skin ) 12 week . Once patient 's hemoglobin level ( Hg ) reach target level 12 g/dL , begin Maintenance Phase . Patients qualify Maintenance Phase receive 6 injection 60,000 U every week ( Q2W ) epoetin alfa skin additional 12 week maintain hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL chemotherapy administration . Doses hold adjust downward hemoglobin level rise &gt; 13 g/dL rapid hemoglobin response occur ( e.g. , increase 1.3 g/dL 2-week period ) . Safety evaluation include clinical laboratory test ( hemoglobin hematocrit ) , vital sign measurement ( blood pressure ) , incidence severity adverse event . In addition , incidence anti-erythropoietin antibody baseline study completion/early withdrawal evaluated patient receive multiple dos PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) . Patients receive 12 injection 60,000 U every week ( QW ) epoetin alfa subcutaneously ( skin ) 12 week . Once patient 's hemoglobin level ( Hg ) reach target level 12 g/dL , begin Maintenance Phase . Patients qualify Maintenance Phase receive 6 injection 60,000 U every week ( Q2W ) epoetin alfa skin additional 12 week maintain hemoglobin 11.5 g/dL chemotherapy administration .</detailed_description>
