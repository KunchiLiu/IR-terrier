	<detailed_description>A human vaccination trial involve influenza A/H5N1 vaccine different adjuvant conduct healthy adult population age 18-64 year ( DMID 04-062 ) test safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity monovalent inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine give either alone ( adjuvant ) , give along either alum MF59 . Two dos vaccine/adjuvent administer day 0 day 28 . This study link DMID protocol 04-062 . This protocol substudy collect additional blood sample specifically evaluate cell-mediated immune response generate vaccine . Primary goal study 1 ) establish reproducible , functional cell-mediate immune response assay evaluate magnitude functional capacity B cell , NK cell T cell respond monovalent subvirion H5 influenza vaccine 2 ) evaluate percent subject demonstrate B cell , NK cell , CD8+ and/or CD4+ response . The secondary goal study examine compare adjuvant effect Alum MF59 compare adjuvant cell mediate immune response .</detailed_description>
