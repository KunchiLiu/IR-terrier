	<brief_summary>Patients infantile late infantile NCL either reduce amount , miss , palmitoyl protein thioesterase 1 ( PPT1 ) enzyme tripeptidyl peptidase 1 ( TPP-I ) enzyme . Human central nervous system stem cell ( HuCNS-SC ) investigational product derive human brain cell . HuCNS-SC show survive migrate within brain mouse . When grown laboratory , HuCNS-SC show produce PPT1 TPP-I enzyme . In mice miss PPT1 enzyme , HuCNS-SC show increase amount enzyme brain , reduce amount abnormal storage material brain , prevent death neuron ( type cell ) brain . Participation study involve screen assessment , surgery implant HuCNS-SC , medication suppress immune system , series follow-up assessment . The length time start screen last follow-up visit approximately 13 month , frequent visit study center time . After completion study , patient monitor additional 4 year separate long term follow-up protocol .</brief_summary>
