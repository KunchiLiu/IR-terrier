	<brief_summary>The standard treatment woman invasive breast cancer local excision follow whole breast radiation . The local recurrence rate low , side effect low , cosmetic outcome excellent . The treatment , however , need give daily 5 1/2 6 1/2 week , make treatment difficult , particularly elderly woman need travel long distance therapy . The goal study determine toxicity efficacy give radiation short time , use high daily dos radiation . The risk recurrence elderly population lower , since majority recurrence occur close area tumor previously , hypothesize radiation area breast would sufficient obtain low risk recurrence . When small volume tissue treat , radiation give daily , therefore treatment shorten . The risk side effect increase dose per daily treatment increase . Therefore , goal study short term side effect , long term side effect , cosmetic outcome daily radiation use high daily dos short period time . We also follow recurrence rate . Because less breast tissue treat , may small increase risk recurrence . Because high fraction size result side effect use intensity modulate radiation ( IMRT ) . IMRT advance individually tailor radiation treatment technique result least amount side effect . It allow tight monitor dose untreated breast . Seventy five woman diagnose stage I breast cancer participate . Participants must lumpectomy , clear margin lymphovascular invasion eligible . A treatment planning CT scan obtain . If lumpectomy cavity clearly delineate , IMRT plan generate predefined strict dose requirement criterion . The patient treat daily , 5 day week , total 10 treatment ( instead standard 28-33 ) . The patient evaluate toxicity weekly treatment , weekly additional 4 week . At evaluation , fill short 10 minute questionnaire detail side effect . Follow-up continue every 3 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year . At follow-ups short questionnaire fill patient detail toxicity , well perception cosmetic outcome . A cosmesis questionnaire also fill evaluate physician radiation , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month , yearly 3 year . A total 5 year follow-up plan . Participants also option consent photograph portion study . Those photographs take breast ( exclude face ) time complete cosmetic questionnaire , evaluate cosmetic outcome .</brief_summary>
