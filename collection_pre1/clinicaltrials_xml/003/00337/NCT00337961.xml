	<brief_summary>The purpose study develop way perform safer surgery eye socket . The eye surround structure delicate easily damage surgery . A laser may act gentle knife cut tissue . Currently , do small scissors knife , could do gentle laser . By use endoscope , surgery could much safer faster . Vanderbilt Free Electron Laser , could use make small hole covering around optic nerve treat certain disease . Before used see eye , laser must test eye remove enucleation prove damage optic nerve The standard enucleation ( removal blind painful eye ) perform . This procedure perform Free Electron Laser Center Operating Room , fully equip operate room currently use outpatient surgery . The post-operative recovery room set similar post-operative recovery room previously use area . This include general anesthesia breathe tube throat , inject anesthetic liquid behind eye comfort surgery , remove eyeball . Enucleations must perform general anesthesia intravenous sedation retrobulbar injection ( injection behind eye ) . The anesthesiologist determine safer perform . The removed globe replace spherical implant . Just prior removal eyeball , small opening make covering around optic nerve ( cable exit eyeball ) endoscopic laser knife scissors . The procedure take much long standard eye removal . The procedure identical standard enucleation ( eye removal ) except make tiny hole covering optic nerve , take 15 30 minute . The laser tissue specific . It react certain type tissue damage surround tissue . There additional cost associate study portion procedure .</brief_summary>
