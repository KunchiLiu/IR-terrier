The use catheter coat and/or impregnate different antimicrobial agent propose reduce risk infection . However , result obtain far reach enough clinical relevance consider medicate catheter valid alternative conventional one . The aim comparative randomize study assess ability recently develop silver ion-releasing central venous catheter prevent associated infection comparison conventional one . Experimental group define follow : - Group A : patient treated standard , triple lumen , non medicate catheter - Group B : patient treat triple lumen catheter impregnate silver nanoparticles</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RATIONALE Central venous catheter ( CVC ) infections one major cause infection acquire intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient . About 25 % bloodstream infection record ICUs secondary proven catheter-related infection 80 % so-called primary bacteraemia may cause catheter . Pittet et al . estimate nosocomial bloodstream infection , irrespective source , associate overall 35 % attributable mortality prolong hospital stay 32 day , include 8 day ICU . Prevention catheter-related infection priority infection control program . Clear preventive measure include strict barrier precaution insertion careful aseptic technique subsequent manipulation catheter . Other preventive measure , include use catheter specifically design inhibit microbial colonisation , antimicrobial-coated catheter , universally accept recommended routine use , also due high cost . Previous trial demonstrate 50 % risk reduction infection rate use antiseptic-coated catheter ; however , efficacy reduce catheter relate bloodstream infection still unclear . A new generation silver nanoparticle impregnate CVCs ( Logicath AgTive® , Medex Medical INC. , UK ) , become recently available , clinical trial document activity prevent microbial colonization catheter carry far . In study , want assess ability new generation catheter prevent short-term ( &lt; 28 day ) catheter-related infection critically ill patient , comparison conventional untreated catheter . STUDY POPULATION All consecutively admit critically ill patient need central venous catheterization 5 day . TRIAL OBJECTIVE AND PURPOSE The objective study test ability new medicate catheter , reduce risk Central Venous Catheter Related Infections ( CVCRI ) ICU patient . CVCRI define positive culture catheter hemoculture concurrently positive microbial strain least two consecutive time . TRIAL DESIGN Study Design This randomize , open , control , parallel multicenter study involve 5 Italian ICUs support clinical microbiology laboratory supervision Prof. Massimo Antonelli , clinical issue Prof Gianfranco Donelli , microbiology issue . Statistical evaluation data responsibility Dott . Andrea De Gaetano , belong Biomatematic Laboratory Italian National Research Council ( CNR-IASI ) . Endpoints The primary end-point difference raw percentage occurrence CVCRI ( patient basis ) group A B . The secondary end-point infection-free time probability CVCRI function multiple predictor . METHODS Randomization blind An Internet-based randomization scheme , stratify center , age gender employ , indicate allocate treatment moment enrollment . The randomization procedure require guide wire exchange perform , catheter allocation group ( medicate medicate ) use . The treatment open physician perform procedure , data collection indicate group membership A B random order . While data manager hold key group/treatment association , adjudication committee member ( decide database record freezing ) statisticians perform analysis blind treatment allocation . Insertion maintenance catheter Recommendations provide study center comply maximal barrier precaution insertion reposition catheter , indicate . A transparent , semipermeable dressing , provide participate ICUs use insertion , allow daily inspection insertion site . Subsequent dressing carry clinically indicate , 2 5 day interval . Line tube three-way stopcock change basis unit 's protocol 1 3 day interval , although change blood product transfusion follow administration lipid solution require . The catheter keep place long required absence complication . Catheters remove longer require , malfunction , suspicion infection otherwise unexplained bloodstream infection occur ; presence gross inflammation pu catheter insertion site . In situ treatment catheter infection allow . Data record The following information record upon inclusion : age , sex , date hospital admission intensive care unit ; underlying disease severity ( McCabe class ) ; admission category ( medical , surgical , whether schedule , trauma ) , diagnosis primary organ failure ICU admission . The severity score SAPS II , organ dysfunction SOFA score also record , well presence active infection focus , ongoing antibiotic therapy , presence intravascular device . Patients follow 48 hour catheter removal . Data record include : ) Mechanical complication occur insertion ( number venipuncture , arterial puncture , hematoma , pneumothorax ) ; b ) presence local sign suggest infection ( erythema catheter skin entry site , score 0 : absence ; 1+ : &lt; 5mm ; 2+ : 5-10mm ; 3+ : &gt; 10mm ; presence induration purulence ) ; c ) presence systemic inflammatory response syndrome symptom characterize severe sepsis ; ) Presence documented infection ; e ) intravascular device place inserted day ; f ) dressing change ; g ) Results blood catheter-tip culture , clinically significant microbiological sampling ; h ) antibiotic administer . Microbiological data Blood culture obtain temperature &gt; 38°2 &lt; 36°5C . Diagnostic sample suspect infection focus take clinically indicate . Upon catheter removal , intravascular catheter tip culture use semi quantitative culture describe Maki et al . ( Maki DG , Weise CE , Sarafin HW . A semiquantitative culture method identify intravenous-catheter-related infection . N Engl J Med 1977 ; 296:1305-1309 ) . This technique involve roll catheter distal tip Agar plate read high-density colonization semiquantitative culture ( 15 colony plate ) . Inclusion Criteria Patients eligible insertion central venous catheter ( CVC ) new site ( subclavian internal jugular ) plan therapy monitoring least 3-day duration . Exclusion Criteria Age 18 year patient history fail catheterization attempt need catheterization site previous surgery , skeletal deformity , scar . Data analysis A Clinical Evaluation ( Adjudication ) Committee compose two coordinate investigator ( Prof. Massimo Antonelli Prof. Gianfranco Donelli ) statistician ( Dr. Andrea De Gaetano ) ass , blindly respect randomization group , evaluability catheter classification episode bloodstream infection catheter positive culture , accord definition . Catheters exclude analysis insertion fail . Catheters adequately followed-up time removal ( transfer another unit hospital ) censor last day follow-up ICU classify Committee infect uninfected , use data available last day follow-up bacteriological data subsequently receive . ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY Adverse Events Complications procedure classify accord Complications Diagnosis Dictionary . Text comment add recording appropriate . Descriptive analysis complication well comparison complication rate ( overall family frequent complication ) obtain . STATISTICS Sample Size Power Computation The catheter-related infection rate estimate 10 % conventional catheter group . Assuming 50 % relative reduction ( 5 % ) silver impregnate CVC treat group , number patient need ( equivalently number patient enrol , assume attrition rate 10 % ) treatment group order reach desire statistical power report , assume Type I error level 0.05 depend significance level number tails statistical test . Two-tailed test consider throughout . A power 80 % consider sufficient . Therefore , 472 patient per group enrol .</detailed_description>
