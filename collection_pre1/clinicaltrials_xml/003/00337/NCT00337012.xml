	<brief_summary>This study focus possible mechanism mediate duloxetine effect painful physical symptom patient suffer MDD . Our hypothesis base assump¬tion dual impairment somatosensory system patient . Hypalgesia phasic experimental pain may due diminish spinal brainstem transmission . Hyperalgesia may at¬tributed increase interoceptive perception ( somatic complaint , especially consist¬ing pain ) due sensitisation lack inhibition interceptive perception . These ef¬fects seem mediate specific brain region ( e.g . right insula ) . The investigator intent test duloxetine effect somatic complaint , especially pain complaint due nor¬malization interceptive alteration report associated depressive symptom . The investigator hypothesize treatment duloxetine normalize `` patho¬logical '' activation pattern ( assessed fMRI ) associate increased interoceptive perception .</brief_summary>
