	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine number patient &gt; 50 % decrease prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) least 4 week duration patient hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer treat E7389 ( eribulin mesylate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate measurable disease response patient measurable disease . II . Determine duration PSA measurable disease response . III . Characterize safety tolerability E7389 patient . OUTLINE : This study enrol 3 cohort patient base number prior chemotherapy regimens receive . The 3 cohort chemonaive stratum , prior-taxane stratum , two-prior-chemotherapy stratum . Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously ( IV ) 5 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
