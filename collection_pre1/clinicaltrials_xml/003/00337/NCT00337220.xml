	<brief_title>Urine Testing Detect Kidney Transplant Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Innovations kidney transplantation improve short-term outcome transplant patient . However , organ rejection remain important threat long-term survival transplant organ . An increase serum creatinine level often first clinical indicator kidney transplant rejection ; however , marker lack sensitivity specificity . Rejection currently diagnose use invasive transplant biopsy procedure ; addition expensive , transplant biopsy result bleed transplant even graft loss . In early study , observe significant increase level perforin , granzyme B , CD3 messenger RNA ( mRNA ) urinary cell signal development acute transplant rejection . The purpose study evaluate whether noninvasive procedure measure perforin , granzyme B , CD3 mRNA level urine sample accurately diagnose predict kidney transplant rejection , make transplant biopsy unnecessary , provide opportunity initiate treatment early rejection aim minimize damage kidney . This study last 3 year post-transplant . There total 14 study visit . Blood urine collection occur visit . Additional visit may necessary participant develop abnormal kidney function .</detailed_description>
