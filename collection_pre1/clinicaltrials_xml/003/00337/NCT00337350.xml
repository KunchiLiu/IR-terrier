	<detailed_description>This study eight-week , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial rosiglitazone schizophrenia subject treat clozapine use Bergman 's Minimal Model Analysis ( MINMOD ) frequent sample intravenous glucose tolerance test ( FSIVGTT ) examination glucose metabolism . Rosiglitazone , use treatment type 2 diabetes , improve glycemic control improve insulin sensitivity target tissue increase glucose uptake improve signal insulin glucose transporter . The MINMOD determines relationship insulin sensitivity , insulin secretion degree obesity use study drug effect upon variable . The computer program estimate glucose effectiveness ( SG ) , insulin sensitivity ( SI ) , acute insulin response glucose ( AIRG ) glucose insulin value measure FSIVGTT . The site subject enrollment , clinical assessment collection blood sample week 2 , 4 , 6 Freedom Trail Clinic Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center . The FSIVGTT blood sample baseline week 8 conduct Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center Massachusetts General Hospital . Subjects include 50 clozapine treat patient diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . Subjects match accord baseline fasting glucose . Subjects maintain pre-study medication . During baseline assessment , member research team conduct PANSS ( Positive Negative Symptom Subscale ) HAM-D ( Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ) repeat week 4 8 determine baseline subsequent change psychopathology . The neuropsychological battery administer baseline week 8 consist : North America Adult Reading Test , Trail Making , Degraded Stimulus Continuous Performance Test , California Verbal Learning Test , Faces Family Picture subtests WMS-III , Wisconsin Card Sorting Test , Letter Category Fluency , Letter-Number Sequencing , Grooved Peg Board . Baseline medical evaluation include weight , height , vital sign , AIMS score , 12-lead EKG physical examination . Subjects instruct eat diet high carbohydrate three day FSIVGTT . They instruct fast 12 hour precede test . On morning test , subject admit General Clinical Research Center Massachusetts General Hospital . A nutritional assessment perform . Baseline blood sample fast glucose , basic chemistry profile , liver enzymes , complete blood count ( cbc ) , insulin , prolactin , lipid profile , glycohemoglobin , leptin , clozapine serum level cortisol drawn . Glucose 0.3 g/kg body weight infused . Approximately 35 2 cc blood sample withdraw measurement glucose insulin concentration . At minute 20 , 0.05 units/kg insulin administer intravenous bolus injection . Following baseline FSIVGTT , subject randomize , double-blind , either rosiglitazone placebo . Subjects randomize receive medication receive rosiglitazone 4mg po qd eight week study end . Subjects monitor symptom diabetes week 2 , 4 , 8 . Subjects evaluate week 2 , 4 , 8 include measurement blood pressure , pulse weight . Adverse event monitor week 2 , 4 , 8 AMDP-5 , survey side effect somatic symptom . The Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12 ( SF-12 ) use measure general health status function . The SF-12 perform baseline , week 4 , 8 study end . A cbc perform every two week , consistent requirement treatment clozapine . At week four , fast glucose , insulin level , liver function test perform . At end eighth week , FSIVGTT repeat blood sample obtain fast glucose , basic chemistry profile , liver enzymes , complete blood count ( cbc ) , insulin , prolactin , lipid profile , glycohemoglobin , leptin , clozapine serum level cortisol . All aspect subject care treatment usual . Potential risk associate intravenous line include bruise site , bleed risk infection . During procedure patient may experience symptom low blood glucose include lightheadedness , dizziness , weakness , irritability , sweat , tremor , tachycardia , anxiety , hunger . The amount blood drawn FSIVGTT approximately 150 cc . A low risk anemia exist secondary FSIVGTT ; anemia also side effect treatment rosiglitazone . Treatment rosiglitazone associate side effect include accidental injury ( cuts abrasion ) , headache , back pain , anemia , edema , weight gain , decrease white blood cell count , increase total cholesterol , LDL , HDL decrease free fatty acid . Phlebotomy may produce discomfort , bruising , rarely , infection . While clinical assessment may stressful , question contain SCID PANSS differ ask routine clinical evaluation . Potential benefit subject include comprehensive diagnostic re-evaluation , screen blood test , estimation risk diabetes . The result test share patient clinician may contribute medical management help patient 's physician decide intervention require reduce risk diabetes . An increased understanding process clozapine induces glucose intolerance awareness diabetes complication prevent concomitant treatment insulin sensitizer potential benefit population .</detailed_description>
