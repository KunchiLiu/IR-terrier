	<detailed_description>There 750,000 individual U.S. Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) . Up 46 % adult CP report limit mobility community . However , upper limb spasticity motor control impairment make independent use wheelchair difficult . Forty percent individual desire mobility via electric wheelchair preclude use problem upper limb function include motor , sensory , cognitive impairment make use conventional joystick difficult . No study date produce device definitively improve mobility individual . We recruit 22 subject Spastic CP 22 age gender match control subject without apparent disability advertisement , mailing , outpatient clinic . Both conventional motion sense joystick ( MSJ ) novel isometric joystick customize subject use maneuver sprite computer screen six different task . Each task involve path 90-degree turn . Two task path completely visible subject , four path appear either immediately 1 , 2 , 3 second ahead sprite . Because subject CP control subject likely drive different speed , subject drive condition freely choose speed speed control 1.2 m/s . Joystick input signal represent sprite 's velocity position record . Changes direction speed , average deviation path center , number boundary violation , start stop reaction time , response time turn , duration subject movement calculate . We use Repeated Measures design , treat speed covariate condition freely choose . We hypothesize , regardless joystick speed condition , subject Spastic CP direction speed change , great average deviation path center , boundary violation , prolong reaction time response time turn , prolong subject movement time compare control . We hypothesize , regardless joystick speed condition , decrease warn time turn correlate direction speed change , great average deviation path center , boundary violation , prolong subject movement time magnitude change great Spastic CP . We hypothesize , regardless speed condition , subject Spastic CP , use MSJ compare isometric joystick , direction speed change , great average path deviation , boundary violation , prolong subject movement . Understanding drive task deficit warn time movement decision help identify customization parameter joystick assistive device , CP Traumatic Brain Injury , Spinal Cord Injury , Parkinson 's Disease , stroke , variety disability .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1. subject must age 1280 2. subject must able give write informed consent consent proxy participate 3. subject diagnosis CP must score 2 3 Modified Ashworth Scale least one follow operate limb : wrist flexor , wrist extensor , elbow flexor , elbow extensor 4. control subject must Modified Ashworth score 0 muscle group upper limb 5. subject must minimal motor ability necessary participate trial . This measured follow : 3 trial , subject must able complete basic virtual driving average minimum speed le 1.2 m/s , average trial time 18 second , average deviation center virtual wheelchair 1.5 path center , two joystick use . These value derive Americans Disabilities Act ( ADA ) standard dimension human walk speed . 1. subject able tolerate sit 2 hour ( estimate length experiment ) 2. subject active pelvic thigh wound ( may worsen prolonged sit ) 3. subject history seizure last 90 day ( uncontrolled seizure may induce computer screen task )</criteria>
