	<brief_title>Cisplatin Induction With Paclitaxel Consolidation Stage III-IV Epithelial Ovarian Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant neoplasm ovary cause death gynecologic cancer . Approximately 26,500 new case diagnosed year United States , 14,500 death occur annually result disease . Clinicians continue frustrate paucity data concern etiologic factor epithelial ovarian cancer failure achieve significant reduction mortality past several decade . Since introduction cisplatin-based chemotherapy , treatment show improve survival subject advance ovarian cancer incorporation paclitaxel primary therapy disease . In 1996 , Gynecologic Oncology Group ( GOG ) publish result large prospective , randomized trial cisplatin cyclophosphamide compare cisplatin paclitaxel . The cisplatin plus paclitaxel regimen note superior base : 1 ) overall improve response rate ; 2 ) increase clinical response rate ( 51 % vs. 31 % ) ; 3 ) increase rate negative second look laparotomy ; 4 ) increase median progression free survival ; importantly 5 ) increase overall median survival ( 38 month vs. 24 month ) . The GOG result recently confirm Canadian- European consortium randomize phase III trial ( OV 10 ) . These large randomized trial establish combination paclitaxel cisplatin standard , first line therapy woman advance ovarian cancer follow cytoreductive surgery . Although majority woman advance ovarian cancer demonstrate objective response combination ; response generally limited duration . The five-year survival advance stage ovarian cancer 20-40 % . Consequently , remain need improve chemotherapeutic approach management ovarian cancer . Topotecan semi-synthetic analog camptothecin , topoisomerase inhibitor . It investigate number phase II trial salvage therapy recurrent ovarian cancer . Overall response rate range 6 % 27 % . In randomized comparative trial topotecan versus paclitaxel , overall response rate 21 % 14 % respectively . The median survival topotecan 63 week compare 53 week paclitaxel . Both drug demonstrate high response rate platinum-sensitive tumor platinum-resistant tumor . These data suggest topotecan may active paclitaxel , partially non-cross resistant cisplatin . Topotecan may better agent paclitaxel use combination cisplatin multiple reason . First , Kern et al demonstrate paclitaxel may antagonize activity cisplatin . Second , topotecan demonstrate synergistic cisplatin paclitaxel vitro . It demonstrate topotecan dramatically potentiate effect platinum , perhaps ability inhibit repair platinum-DNA adduct . Clinically , extensive experience topotecan cisplatin . Recently , several investigator evaluate combination paclitaxel , cisplatin topotecan . As expect , myelosuppression dose-limiting factor . Herben et al recently report result phase I trial use combination paclitaxel , cisplatin , topotecan first line therapy advance stage ovarian cancer . Interestingly , author could achieve dose topotecan would consider `` optimal '' treatment relapse disease single-agent fashion . The inability utilize therapeutic dose combine either platinum paclitaxel demonstrate previous report affirms bone marrow suppressive effect . The clinical response rate trial report 86.7 % .</detailed_description>
