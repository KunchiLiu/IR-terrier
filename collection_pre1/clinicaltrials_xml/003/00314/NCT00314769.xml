	<brief_summary>This study examine whether continuous use transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) combination motor train lead long-term improvement movement performance beyond achieve motor train alone . Healthy normal volunteer 18-80 year age clearly right- left-handed may eligible study . Each candidate screen medical history , clinical neurological examination , questionnaires evaluate memory , attention , handedness brain MRI , one do NINDS within 12 month enter study . Pregnant woman may participate . The study involve 10 session ( addition screen visit ) 3 month . Sessions 1-5 complete 5 consecutive day . Sessions 6-10 divide remaining time . Participants randomly assign one three group : 1 ) tDCS motor training ; 2 ) tDCS training ; 3 ) training sham tDCS . During session , participant perform pinch force task ( squeeze small device thumb forefinger ) visuomotor task ( use device move cursor computer screen various target hold cursor place 1 second ) . During motor training performance session , participant follow procedure . - TMS measurement : A wire coil hold scalp , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , subject may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . - tDCS : Small , wet sponge electrode apply head - one eye back head . A small electrical current pass . The subject may feel itch tingle sensation electrode see light flash . Some session do sham tDCS . - Surface electromyography : Electrodes fill conductive gel tap skin one small hand muscle measure electrical activity muscle . - Behavioral measurement : Evaluation learn movement task - Questionnaires evaluate subject 's attention , fatigue mood test</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Motor practice use one session lead use-dependent plasticity . When practice repeat multiple session , motor performance continue improve plateau performance , so-called ceiling effect reach . This issue particularly important neurorehabilitative treatment patient usually reach ceiling effect without improvement . Thus , would desirable modify ceiling effect motor rehabilitation . The purpose protocol determine repeat application TDCS , form non-invasive cortical stimulation know transiently improve performance , association training , could elicit additional improvement motor performance beyond ceiling effect identify performance visuomotor training task . We test hypothesis anodal TDCS apply M1 temporal relation motor train lead prominent long-term learning visuomotor task relative sham stimulation ( would document ceiling effect ) healthy individual chronic stroke patient traumatic brain injury ( TB1 ) patients.. STUDY POPULATION : We plan study 177 healthy volunteer ( part 1 ) 60 chronic stroke patient ( part 2 ) 50 TB1 patient 50 additional healthy volunteer ( part 3 ) . Therefore , overall enrollment 337 participant plan . DESIGN : The study follow parallel design . Healthy volunteer ( part 1 ) stroke patient ( part 2 ) randomly allocate one three group . Each group receive anodal TDCS sham fixed time frame related motor training ( immediately motor training ) . TB1 patient healthy volunteer ( part 3 ) randomly allocate one two group . Each group receive either sham anodal tDCS training . Healthy volunteer stroke patient participate 10 session . First , train visuomotor task ( VMT ) 5 consecutive day receive sham stimulation ( group 3 ) TDCS ( group 1 ) , immediately ( group 2 ) training . Performance VMT re-evaluated 30 , 60 90 day first train session . Traumatic brain injury ( TB1 ) patient group healthy volunteer ( part 3 ) participate 6 session . First , train visumomotor task ( VMT ) 3 consecutive day receive anodal tDCS sham stimulation training . Performance VMT re-evaluated 30 , 60 , 90 day first train session . OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcome measure percentage change ( baseline day 8 healthy volunteer stroke patient , baseline day 3 traumatic brain injury ) total time necessary complete 15 correct trial visuomotor task . Secondary outcome accuracy ( . error ) timing ( speed ) variability force adaptation visuomotor task ( Celnik , data ) , pinch force time point , include day 5 measure learn training period 3 month measure long-term retention . In patient group Jebsen Taylor Test use assess gross motor function . To good understand mechanism underlie propose behavioral gain , use single- paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) identify corticomotor excitability change . Furthermore volunteer answer several questionnaire evaluate fatigue mood ( PANAS ) perform short neuropsychological control task control change attention memory function .</detailed_description>
