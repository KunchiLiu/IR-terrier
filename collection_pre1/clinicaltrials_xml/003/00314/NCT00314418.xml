	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy usually associate coiling ( `` loop '' ) colonoscope ( instrument use procedure ) part bowel . This main reason patient discomfort lengthen duration procedure . Minimizing coil colonoscope would decrease duration , improve efficiency tolerability procedure positive impact colon cancer screening . The primary aim study compare time take colonoscope reach end colon patient lie belly versus left side ( usual ) start procedure . Patients medical condition may affect lie belly comfortably lie belly exclude study . Changes patient position use abdominal pressure ( commonly give endoscopy nurse procedure ) permit necessary determined endoscopist . The endoscopist also retain decision discontinue patient 's participation study medical reason . After procedure patient monitor usual manner ask fill `` satisfaction survey '' ( 24 hour ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Principal investigator : Shivakumar Vignesh MD , Gastroenterology Attending Physician , VACHS Colonoscopy patient prone position may reduce colonoscopy duration may reduce patient discomfort reduction coil colonoscope mobile part bowel , decrease need abdominal pressure less sedation may improve safety efficacy colonoscopy . Objective : To determine start colonoscopy patient prone position reduce cecal intubation time ( time reach cecum ) total sedation requirement . Subjects : 120 adult male , patient refer outpatient colonoscopy study subject control . We 15-18 colonoscopy day assume half number meet criterion inclusion consent study able recruit 120 patient 6 month less . Our record indicate 1000 colonoscopy perform six-month period . If conservatively estimate 10 % ineligible patient &gt; ( n=900 remain ) , 50 % refusal ( n=450 remain ) , enrollment 4 5 weekday ( n=360 remain ) , six-month period would provide adequate sample size . The study would end target sample size reach early . Inclusion criterion : All adult , male patient present outpatient colonoscopy . Patients colonoscopy past present first colonoscopy invite participate study . It matter first repeat colonoscopy randomize either position . Exclusion criterion : Severe obstructive lung disease require home oxygen , congestive heart failure adequately manage , condition cause breathe difficulty , massive ascites ( fluid accumulation cause tensely distend abdomen ) , inability lie prone reason . Patients allergic Versed Fentanyl exclude study . All female patient exclude comprise le 2 % colonoscopy ’ routinely check female patient pregnant safety lie prone colonoscopy pregnancy unknown . No vulnerable population ( ) include . Selection : At time presentation outpatient colonoscopy , patient satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion educate purpose , risk benefit study inform consent obtain . Participants randomize use permuted block scheme equal allocation among treatment arm . Treatment initiate immediately follow random assignment . The statistician release randomization scheme assignment Karl Larson PA ( involve study ) inform PI study assignment patient consent , prior colonoscopy . Recruitment : For single center ( VACHS ) study plan enroll total 120 patient among patient present outpatient colonoscopy , 60 arm . Dr.Vignesh ( PI ) select patient apply inclusion exclusion criterion , review VA medical record , take history physical ( do every colonoscopy ) time obtain consent colonoscopy study . They randomize use permuted block randomization scheme allocation conceal till start procedure . Research Plan : Single-center ( VACHS ) , Prospective , randomize , control , non-blinded ( The GI fellow data analysis , blind assignment ) study position colonoscopy veteran undergoing outpatient colonoscopy . Basis sample size calculation : The national average time cecal intubation 15 minute . A reduction colonoscopy duration 3 minute would clinically meaningful reduce cost . We 15-20 outpatient colonoscopy two room one nurse per room daily West Haven VA reduction 3 minute per colonoscopy save 45-60 minute per day include potential reduction recovery time use less sedation . Sample size calculation , use nQuery Advisor , assume 15 minute standard procedure , 12 minute prone procedure ( common standard &gt; deviation 5 minute ) ; difference duration 2 minute important public health implication consider clinically meaningful study modification Colonoscopy procedure ( 4,5,6,7,8,9 ) . Using two-tail alpha error 0.05 , beta error 0.10 ( power &gt; 90 % ) , 60 patient arm would require ( 120 total ) . The study would end target sample size reach early . Methodology : The bowel preparation , type colonoscope , technique ( include polypectomy ) routine practice , mention complete . All patient undergo outpatient colonoscopy institution receive follow bowel preparation : 1 . Clear liquid diet 24 hour prior procedure 2 . One gallon Golytely day prior colonoscopy start noon . 3 . Patients serum creatinine 2.0 drink 300 cc magnesium citrate follow Golytely . Standard adult colonoscope use . Polyps remove snare polypectomy biopsy upon withdrawal colonoscope cecum normal practice . In event failure reach cecum standard adult colonoscope , variable-stiffness colonoscope ( adult pediatric ) use ( 4 , 6 ) . In patient severe stenosing diverticular disease , difficulty navigate affect segment pediatric variable stiffness colonoscope use ( 5 ) . Midazolam Fentanyl medication use , dose depend patient ’ vital sign discomfort . Vital sign monitor every 5 minute procedure . All patient place oxygen 2 liter via nasal cannula prior commencement colonoscopy . After start procedure change patient ’ position abdominal pressure document . Baseline data demographic information include height , weight , age , co-morbid illness history abdominal surgery collect patient enable comparison two arm . After start procedure patient ’ position alter abdominal pressure use help colonoscopy document “ position change ” “ abdominal pressure ” crossover . Our study power measure differences “ position change ” “ abdominal pressure ” merely describe . The patient whose position alter analyzed base original group assignment ( Intent treat analysis ) . Complications colonoscopy rare ( Bleeding &lt; 1 % ) perforation ( &lt; 0.02 % ) describe occur study power analyze . Primary Endpoint : 1 ) Time cecal intubation Secondary Endpoint : 1 ) Total medication ( Midazolam Fentanyl ) dose dichotomize low ( Midazolam 4mg IV less , Fentanyl 200 mcg IV le ) high ( Midazolam &gt; 4 mg IV Fentanyl &gt; 200 mcg IV ) . The time cecal intubation measure t-test used compare difference mean duration . The total opiate dos record dichotomize low ( Midazolam 4mg IV less , Fentanyl 200 mcg IV le ) high ( Midazolam &gt; 4 mg IV Fentanyl &gt; 200 mcg IV ) compare use Chi-square test . The prone position ( lie belly ) increase risk complication base experience . We do hundred colonoscopy safely prone position . The prone position patient ’ head turn one side may reduce aspiration risk facilitate drainage secretion via mouth . By apply exclusion criterion offer study patient medical condition affect lie belly . Colonoscopies do “ conscious sedation ” , last 30 minute stringent cardio respiratory monitoring . For study follow standard continuous cardio-respiratory monitoring , blood pressure measurement every 5 minute . We also administer Oxygen 2 liter nasal cannula routinely . We adverse event form document case cardio-respiratory depression adverse event procedure involve conscious sedation . The physician involve conscious sedation certify “ Conscious sedation airway management ” course conduct Yale New Haven hospital . Informed Consent obtain colonoscopy outline risk separately study use VA research consent form . The consent obtain ambulatory procedure unit patient prepared colonoscopy . We strictly adhere HIPAA regulation daily practice . The information obtain study patient ’ medical record de-identified accessible investigator mention exclusively . Your research record keep confidential possible gastroenterologist endoscopy nurse participate case access information obtain study . Only code number identify research record . The code number base information could use identify . The master list link name code number keep separately research data . All research information keep locked file time . Only authorize research staff access information gather study . A note describe participation research study place VA medical record .</detailed_description>
