	<brief_summary>This study explore growth dermal neurofibroma ( skin tumor ) patient neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) . Investigators try learn : 1 ) fast ( slow ) benign tumor grow NF1 , 2 ) often new tumor appear 3 ) gene involve growth tumor . Men woman 20 50 year age diagnose NF1 biological parent eligible study . Patients NF1 evaluate NIH Clinical Center follow test procedure : - Medical examination draw family tree . - Photos back , abdomen thigh order count number skin tumor . - Photos skin take special camera ( Primos camera ) take detailed picture small area skin . - Photos skin take dermatoscope , take detailed picture small area skin high magnification . - Biopsy least one skin tumor biopsy small piece normal skin . - Blood sample collection genetic test gene NF1 establish cell line . - Other medical test ( e.g. , x-rays MRI ) need . Patients family also genetic counseling session opportunity ask question neurofibromatosis type 1 . Patients return NIH 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 24 month follow-up photograph possibly blood sample . Biological parent patient provide blood sample genetic testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This protocol result fund 2005 Bench-to-Bedside Award explore genetic basis disease severity neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) evaluation three method measure disease progression dermal neurofibroma . NF1 common multisystem genetic disorder associate development benign malignant tumor , primarily nervous system . NF1 100 % penetrant feature variable expressivity limit phenotype/genotype correlation . No standard treatment surgery exist NF1-associated tumor . Many aspect natural history NF1-associated tumor fully characterize require investigation ass effect potential new treatment , future clinical trial . The development medical treatment NF1-associated tumor important goal give morbidity lack non-surgical treatment option . The ability predict ultimate severity disease would significant impact management treatment individual NF1 . Sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) novel , orally bioavailable agent target downstream effector Ras signal pathway ( key dysregulated pathway NF1 ) . It thus strong scientific rationale evaluation NF1 related tumor . Dermal neurofibromas occur nearly every individual NF1 , significant cosmetic problem major cause morbidity . This protocol 1 ) quantify growth dermal neurofibroma NF1 3 different image modality 2 ) use innovative gene expression method identify genetic modifier dermal neurofibroma burden , 3 ) evaluate dermal neurofibroma normal skin presence target sorafenib . Successful validation reliable quantitative imaging method dermal neurofibroma growth logical prerequisite subsequent clinical trial medical treatment , evaluate effect new agent growth rate dermal neurofibroma . Identification genetic modifier may permit prediction ultimate tumor burden . Evaluation target new agent dermal neurofibromas allow rationale drug development NF1 . Given paucity protocol adult NF1 dermal neurofibroma , study likely generate great interest among affected individual rapid accrual .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA GROUP A INDIVIDUALS : 1 . Clinical diagnosis NF1 . In order meet diagnosis NF1 individual must 2 diagnostic criterion list : Six cafeaulait macule ( great equal 0.5 cm prepubertal subject great equal 1.5 cm postpubertal subject ) Freckling axilla groin A tumor optic pathway Two Lisch nodule A distinctive bony lesion ( dysplasia sphenoid bone dysplasia thin long bone cortex ) A plexiform neurofibroma two neurofibroma A firstdegree relative NF1 criterion We may request medical record potential enrollee review . Ideally , individual evaluate geneticist definitive diagnosis make . However give unique , familial ( often unmistakable feature ) NF1 likely diagnosis reliably make nongeneticist . 2 . Age study entry : 20 50 year ( inclusive ) 3 . Identification physician responsible followup care , need 4 . Ability willingness travel NIH Clinical Center University Alabama Birmingham Alabama multiple evaluation 5 . Ability willingness biologic parent provide blood ( saliva ) sample 6 . Must least one dermal neurofibroma amenable excisional biopsy . Preferably neurofibroma thorax abdomen least size pencil eraser . INCLUSION CRITERIA GROUP B INDIVIDUALS : 1 . Biological parent ( either affect unaffected ) Group A individual 2 . Willingness donate blood saliva sample genotyping 3 . Willing undergo brief skin eye exam NIH CC ( rule NF1 ) University Alabama , accompany adult child EXCLUSION CRITERIA GROUP A INDIVIDUALS MEDICAL INCLUSIONS : 1 . Any history administration ( current use ) radiation therapy , chemotherapeutic agent biologic agent ( experimental ) result documented significant change dermal neurofibroma tumor burden growth . 2 . Patients probable segmental mosaic NF1 exclude study participation medical record may review prior enrollment determination . 3 . A history administration medication within 6 month study entry might reasonably expect alter natural history tumor growth ( example include pirfenidone , interferon , farnesyl transferase inhibitor ( FTI ) , MTX/VBL , thalidomide , growth hormone ) cause significant change gene expression profile . 4 . Known suspect untreated bleeding diathesis platelet disorder would preclude safe successful dermal neurofibroma skin biopsy . Patients prescribed aspirin known/suspected agent interferes platelet function may also exclude safely discontinue use week ahead biopsy . 5 . Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness , serious infection , hepatic , renal organ dysfunction , judgment principal investigator associate investigator would compromise patient 's ability participate study procedure . 6 . Inability unwillingness tolerate dermal neurofibroma excision skin biopsy blood draw . VULNERABLE POPULATIONS EXCLUSIONS 1 ) Cognitive delay extent conscious sedation require obtain dermal neurofibroma excision skin biopsy . OTHER EXCLUSIONS 1 . Biologic parent unable unwilling provide blood ( saliva ) sample . 2 . Inability travel NIH The University Alabama Birmingham , AL 3 . Individuals refuse excisional tumor skin biopsy .</criteria>
