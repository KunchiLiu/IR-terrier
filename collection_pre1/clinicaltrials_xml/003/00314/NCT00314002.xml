	<detailed_description>Official Title : Compassionate Use Catheter Thrombectomy ( Aspirex 11F ) Patients With Massive Pulmonary Embolism Principal Investigator : Nils Kucher , MD , Cardiovascular Division , Interventional Cardiology , Andreas Grüntzig Catheterization Laboratories , Raemistrasse 100 University Hospital Zurich , 8091 Zurich , Switzerland , Phone : +41 1 255 8762 , kuchernils @ yahoo.com Sponsor : Straub Medical AG , Straubstrasse , 73 23 Wangs , Schweiz August 29 , 2005 I . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE A ) Historical Background Acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) potentially life-threatening disease overall 3-month mortality rate exceed 15 % , right ventricular ( RV ) dysfunction common cause death ( 1 ) . The 30-day mortality rate patient massive PE , define cardiogenic shock systemic systolic pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg , exceed 30 % . In patient massive PE , systemic thrombolysis ( 2 ) surgical embolectomy ( 3-5 ) addition anticoagulation may life-saving , facilitate rapid reversal RV failure cardiogenic shock . Catheter-directed thrombolysis aim accelerate clot lysis achieve rapid reperfusion pulmonary artery ( 6 ) . Rapid recanalization pulmonary artery thrombolysis ( 7,8 ) embolectomy ( 4 ) may improve functional class , decrease risk recurrence , prevent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension . However , approximately 35 % patient eligible thrombolysis major contraindication , recent surgery , trauma , cancer ( 9 ) . PE thrombolysis accompany particularly high risk bleed complication . Among 304 patient International Cooperative Pulmonary Embolism registry ( ICOPER ) receive PE thrombolysis , 66 ( 21.7 % ) suffer major bleed 9 ( 3.0 % ) intracranial bleeding ( 1 ) . Few tertiary care center offer emergency surgical embolectomy round-the-clock availability ( 3 ) . This operation mandate median sternotomy , circulatory arrest cardiopulmonary bypass , incision main pulmonary artery . In 2 large PE registry , surgical embolectomy use 1 % patient massive PE cardiogenic shock . The alternative thrombolysis surgical embolectomy reverse PE-related right heart failure cardiogenic shock percutaneous catheter thrombectomy ( 10,11 ) . Catheter thrombectomy particularly important contraindication thrombolysis present surgical embolectomy feasible available .

An ideal PE thrombectomy catheter device currently available . The Greenfield suction embolectomy catheter available long PE catheter device approve Food Drug Administration ( 12,13 ) . However , limitation include large catheter size , require surgical cutdown venous puncture site , well stiffness , difficulty manipulate catheter desire location within pulmonary vascular tree . In addition , substantial risk re-embolization aspiration pressure may sufficient hold thrombus place remove catheter thrombus trap within suction cap . Thrombus fragmentation without embolectomy use balloon angioplasty pigtail rotational catheter also report ( 15-17 ) . Macroembolization , however , may cause deterioration hemodynamics large centrally locate thrombus break embolizes previously non-obstructed lobar branch ( 17 ) . Several mechanical rheolytic embolectomy device , include Angiojet ( Possis , Minneapolis , MN ) , Amplatz `` clot buster '' ( BARD-Microvena , White Bear Lake , MN ) , Hydrolyser ( Cordis , Warren , NJ ) , design use large-sized main pulmonary artery investigate small PE cohort study ( 18-23 ) . These catheter device limit efficacy treat massive PE plague complication include mechanical hemolysis , macro- microembolization ( 23 ) . Mechanical hemolysis occur macerate blood thrombus remove catheter . Transient mechanical hemolysis 24-48 hour duration report following catheter thrombectomy , particularly Amplatz device hydrodynamic device Angiojet catheter ( 23 ) . Catheter thrombectomy use 5 % patient massive PE cardiogenic shock ( 1 ) . In summary , potentially life-saving therapy , include surgical embolectomy catheter thrombectomy withheld 30 % patient massive PE contraindication thrombolysis . B ) The Aspirex PE catheter thrombectomy device An ideal percutaneous PE thrombectomy catheter : 1 ) highly maneuverable allow rapid right heart passage advancement major pulmonary artery , 2 ) effective remove obstruct thrombi major pulmonary artery facilitate rapid improvement hemodynamics , reverse right heart failure cardiogenic shock , 3 ) safe without cause damage cardiac structure pulmonary artery , without cause significant blood loss , distal thrombus embolization , mechanical hemolysis .

RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS Major risk pulmonary angiography PE catheter thrombectomy include perforation dissection cardiovascular structure treat untreated pulmonary artery , pericardial tamponade , hemothorax , pulmonary hemorrhage serious consequence . The risk complication diagnostic pulmonary angiography le 0.5 % may occur frequently pulmonary thrombectomy . Thrombectomy perform main lobar segmental pulmonary artery minimize risk perforation dissection . Thrombectomy terminate soon hemodynamic improvement achieve , regardless angiographic result . In addition , catheter thrombectomy must perform surgical back-up , i.e. , immediate availability cardiovascular surgical team operating room cardiopulmonary bypass . In case perforation , interventional cardiologist reverse minimize anticoagulation , insert pericardial drain , place balloon catheter cover vascular perforation site . Injection contrast agent require localize obstruct pulmonary embolus control success thrombectomy procedure . There risk worsen right ventricular failure contrast injection patient massive pulmonary embolism . The contrast injection volume rate must therefore minimized patient end-diastolic PAP &gt; 25 mm Hg . Other potential complication include arrhythmia , tricuspid pulmonic regurgitation , vascular access complication , include hematoma , pseudoaneurysm , AV fistula , anaphylactic reaction iodine contrast . Bleeding may occur site anticoagulation intravenous unfractionated heparin . Renal failure may occur due use iodine contrast pulmonary angiography , particularly patient preexist renal dysfunction . One disadvantage Aspirex device blood extract thrombectomy . Prolonged aspiration may potentially cause hemodynamic deterioration patient PE-related shock . In patient massive thrombus load , prolonged thrombectomy may require reverse cardiogenic shock may result significant blood loss . In situation , transfusion 1 2 unit pack red blood cell may necessary . Catheter thrombectomy may occasionally ineffective remove centrally locate pulmonary embolus reverse cardiogenic shock . Surgical embolectomy consider fail catheter thrombectomy . The sponsor study , Straub Medical AG , Wangs , Switzerland contract insurance cover cost device-related damage death . Since mortality massive PE exceedingly high patient may die despite technically successful procedure , insurance cover event related device-related damage . VIII . POTENTIAL BENEFITS Catheter thrombectomy treat massive PE rapidly reverse acute right ventricular failure cardiogenic shock therefore potentially life-saving . Catheter thrombectomy represent reperfusion strategy contraindication thrombolysis present surgical embolectomy feasible readily available . In addition , catheter thrombectomy minimally invasive interventional therapy without need cardiopulmonary bypass set fail right ventricle . If reperfusion therapy , include thrombolysis , catheter thrombectomy , surgical embolectomy addition anticoagulation initiate , risk death hospitalization patient massive PE exceed 30 % ( 7,10 ) . Standard therapy thrombolysis associate increase risk major hemorrhage , intracranial hemorrhage report 3 % patient massive PE ( 1 ) . In comparison thrombolysis , catheter thrombectomy cause few systemic bleeding complication , include serious complication intracranial hemorrhage . IX .
