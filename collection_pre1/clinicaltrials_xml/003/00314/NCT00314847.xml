	<brief_summary>Cardiogenic shock currently main cause death myocardial infarction 50 % death occur within first 48 hour . To limit extent myocardial necrosis primary objective treatment context . The symptomatic treatment ventricular failure alone allow reduction mortality . The immediate prognosis significantly improve current standard care , include early revascularisation intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation . In order improve immediate prognosis , seem necessary limit irreversible myocardial lesion systemic inflammatory response induce extended myocardial infarction ( complement activation , cytokine production , iNOS expression , etc. ) . These objective may reach extended utilization availability circulatory assistance method . The investigator propose compare , randomise multicenter study , two treatment myocardial infarction cardiogenic shock among 44 patient : Standard Treatment versus ECLS-Impella +/- standard treatment . In June 2007 , amendment replace device ECMO use Impella intra-thoracic pump . This amendment approve Ethic Committee July 7 , 2007 . In March 2009 , new amendment approve EC . This amendment allow revise number patient enroll ( reduced 44 ) lead u modify also primary endpoint : variation BNP level H0 H24 ( H0 define near value BNP level obtain randomization ) .Showing important BNP level decrease experimental group compare standard treatment group , investigator obtain indirect argument show superior efficacy test strategy .</brief_summary>
