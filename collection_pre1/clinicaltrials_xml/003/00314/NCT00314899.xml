	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect malaria mother development child 's immune system response malaria whether expose malaria womb make child likely get malaria . The study also assess effect exposure malaria womb child 's growth development first three year life . Study participant include 480 healthy pregnant woman ( great equal 15 year age ) , healthy offspring , 20 healthy people United States malaria exposure disease 40 adult Kenyans previously expose malaria malaria sign infection . Study procedure include ultrasound ( procedure ass baby 's growth development womb ) , blood , urine , stool collection . Newborns examine birth , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 36 month age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim study determine prenatal exposure malaria influence development humoral cellular immune response malaria blood stage antigens birth 3 year age . In addition , study determine risk factor mechanisms associate congenital malaria exposure fetus malaria blood stage antigen , assess prenatal exposure malaria affect susceptibility malaria infection infancy , evaluate perinatal exposure malaria affect growth development infancy . A primary goal research examine cohort infant birth 36 month age ; predictive value allele-specific invasion inhibitory antibody Merozoite Surface Protein 1 ( MSP1 ) antibody titer MSP1 evaluate respect type magnitude neonatal cellular humoral immune response MSP1 . An understanding natural immunity MSP1 , influence prenatal exposure , may critical inform interpretation immunologic , parasitologic , clinical endpoint vaccine trial use blood stage antigens ultimately directed infant child . Healthy adult pregnant woman ( great equal 15 year age ) healthy offspring ( begin birth ) follow 36 month old . Newborns examine birth 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 36 month age . Enrollment occur time first visit antenatal clinic second trimester peripheral blood , stool , urine sample obtain pregnant woman . A finger stick blood sample obtain mother subsequent antenatal visit ass presence malaria pregnancy . An ultrasound examination do mother initial antenatal visit assess gestational age 26-30 week assure proper growth development fetus screen potential problem . At delivery venous finger stick blood , stool , urine obtain mother . Umbilical cord placental blood , placental biopsy obtain , thereafter infant follow every 6 month ( plus minus 2 month ) . A physical examination infant do peripheral blood , stool , urine obtain infant . The study population also include 20 healthy adult North American control subject malaria exposure infection 40 adult Kenyans either expose malaria asymptomatic malaria infection .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>At least great equal 15 year age . Willingness provide informed consent . Confirmed pregnancy . Apparent good health . Longterm residence Msambweni location anticipate reside area study period ( least 3 year ) . Women whose immediate and/or extend family reside Kwale District discourage enrol study . Willingness donate blood ( peripheral venous blood fingerstick blood per protocol ) ANC visit time delivery . Willingness release human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) test result voluntary counseling treatment ( VCT ) program , tested staff , positive , infant test HIV 12 24 month age . Willingness infant 's mother participate prenatal postnatal care Msambweni District Hospital . Willingness mother/caregivers participate prospective survey involve biannual venipuncture ( 35 mL blood volume ) infant commence 6 month ( plus minus 2 month age ) end age 36 month . Multiple birth include . Pregnant woman allow enroll irrespective gestational age , although enroll delivery undergo adequate consent . However , potential participant strongly encourage come clinic prenatal care early second trimester ( ideally &lt; 16 week gestation ) ensure adequate prenatal care mother unborn infant provide sufficient followup time collect multiple antenatal study sample mother . Inclusion criterion American participant : Participants must good health , age 18 65 , never expose malaria . Inclusion criterion Kenyan control subject : Participants must general good health either expose malaria infect malaria , asymptomatic . Exposure determine presence antibody malarial bloodstage antigen , eg , MSP142 . Subjects must age 18 55 year , inclusive . Preterm delivery less 34 week gestation . Failure deliver hospital . Evidence placenta previa . Maternal chorioamnionitis . Receipt immunosuppressive drug pregnancy . Hemoglobin le 6.07 g/dL females* . More One plus great glucose urine . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 3 month precede enrollment study . Simultaneous participation interventional clinical trial . Acute chronic pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic , renal neurological condition , finding opinion CO PI may increase risk participate study . Other condition opinion CO PI would jeopardize safety right participant trial would render participant unable comply protocol . These value may change base survey adult normal laboratory test value Msambweni . Values child revise base survey pediatric normal value Msambweni . Censoring event mother newborn ( , default , infant 's mother ) : Mother delivers elsewhere , migrates area , dy , spontaneous abortion stillbirth . APGAR score infant less 5 10 minute birth . Muconium aspiration , respiratory distress syndrome , condition require neonatal resuscitation . Extremely low birth weight ( less 1500 gram ) . Refuse continue participate study . Participants move outside study area course study drop participation . However , data collect point may include analysis . Exclusion American Kenyan control subject : No prior screening perform American control subject , state healthy acute chronic medical problem . For Kenyan adult control subject , also query general overall perceive health know acute chronic illness . A FSB sample obtain Kenyan control subject test antibody MSP142 , blood smear malaria , hemoglobin concentration Hemacue test . If hemoglobin concentration &lt; 10 gm/dL , subject ask donate blood refer appropriate health care deliverer receive appropriate treatment ( oral iron supplement ) .</criteria>
