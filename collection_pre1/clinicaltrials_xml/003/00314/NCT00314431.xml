	<brief_summary>Based success telephone follow group medically fragile infant , design innovative model post-hospital comprehensive coordinate follow-up infant chronic lung disease . In model , refer community-based follow-up , medical management coordinate nurse specialist , frequent telephone contact infant ’ primary caregiver . This model follow care compare , randomize trial , traditional model - multidisciplinary medical center-based care .

	<brief_title>Post-Hospitalization Nursing Effectiveness ( PHONE ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>METHODS Study design A randomized equivalence trial design compare community-based follow medical-center base follow . The primary outcome assess one year adjust age . Study participants Infants recruit five neonatal intensive care unit northwest North CArolina . These site provide neonatal intensive care twenty-county region northwest North Carolina . Infants bear March 1996 September 1999 . Infants eligible study bear 33 week gestational age , require supplemental oxygen 36 week gestational age , discharge home neonatal intensive care . Neonates major congenital anomaly and/ tracheostomy tube exclude . Also exclude family mother speak English , intervention depend verbal communication nurse specialist , family live 150 mile clinic family typically refer regional neonatal center closer home . Randomization A randomization list prepared biostatistician involve data collection clinical care infant . Lists randomization assignment , keep seal envelope lock drawer , prepare five site participant recruit . Randomization assignment make block size two four . Once study participant arrive home neonatal intensive care unit , research assistant uncover next assignment randomization list , keep seal envelope lock drawer . Intervention If family telephone service time infant 's discharge , telephone instal cost family , within one week infant 's discharge hospital . Research fund used reimburse family cost local phone service duration study . Families assign either intervention could contact nurse specialist toll-free long distance line voice mail record message phone attend . The intervention team consist two neonatologists , pediatric social worker , nurse specialist . Community-based follow Telephone contact make infant ’ primary caregiver nurse specialist twice weekly first month discharge , weekly month two four , monthly thereafter infant attain 12 month adjust age . At telephone contact , nurse use semi-structured format inquire infant 's health , community resource utilized infant , potential stressor source support family . She also inquire infant 's medication feeding . If judge infant would benefit change medical management , additional assessment subspecialty referral , discuss propose change one two study neonatologists . If agreement , recommendation communicate family infant ’ primary care provider . The nurse specialist also coordinate care infant communicate home health nurse , public health nurse , early intervention specialist , physical therapist , pediatric sub-specialists . Medical center-based follow For infant discharge home supplemental oxygen , nurse specialist make home visit 1 2 week discharge . During visit , nurse specialist obtain interim medical history , perform physical assessment include pulse oximetry body weight , review discharge instruction regard medication dosage use durable medical equipment , answer caregiver ’ question infant ’ care . If nurse specialist concern medical condition infant , make change plan care consultation study neonatologist . All infant assign center-based care group see regional , high-risk infant multidisciplinary clinic Wake Forest University School Medicine . The first clinic visit occur approximately one month discharge . A multidisciplinary team consist social worker , nurse specialist neonatologist obtain detailed interim medical history ( feeding , respiratory status , medication history , illnesses health-services utilization ) perform complete physical examination . Family stressor resource discuss . All infant schedule visit four , eight , twelve month adjust age . In addition , infant use supplemental oxygen see interval 1-2 month follow criterion meet : 1 ) growth rate 15-30 grams/day , 2 ) long use supplemental oxygen medication , 3 ) long use home apnea monitor . At clinic visit , infant parent guardian see individually clinic social worker , nurse specialist project , one two neonatologists confer group develop plan care . This plan communicate family nurse specialist . Communication primary care provider Within 24 hour randomization , principal investigator call infant ’ primary care provider inform study design parent consent participate study . In case infant randomize community-based care , primary care provider give choice make decision change medical care independently jointly nurse specialist . A copy protocol management infant CLD , develop study team mail primary care provider . After clinic visit ( center-based group ) primary care provider receive letter describe finding , impression , recommendation . Contacts primary care physicians infant randomize community-based care occur whenever nurse specialist believe change care indicate . Outcomes assess first year Self-administered questionnaire use assess psychosocial status family , healthcare utilization healthcare expense baseline , one , four , seven eleven month . Each time family complete study questionnaires home visit make , family give twenty dollar compensation . At eleven month , research assistant conduct home visit assess home use Caldwell HOME Inventory,27 parent-infant interaction use scale develop Holditch Miles.28 Only result rehospitalization rate first year present paper . Outcomes assess one year adjust age All child evaluate one year adjust age Development Evaluation Clinic dedicate solely developmental assessment high-risk infant . The primary outcome , Bayley Scales Infant Development-Second Edition ( BSID-2 ) Mental Developmental Index ( MDI ) I , two secondary outcome – BSID Pyschomotor Developmental Index ( PDI ) Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales ( VABS ) assess child psychologist psychology graduate student supervise child psychologist , aware child ’ intervention group medical history . After test complete , psychologist inform infant ’ gestational age birth , BSID score could correct degree prematurity . The BSID MDI widely use validated developmental assessment tool measure cognitive development first two year life . The BSID PDI measure fine gross motor development.29 The population mean score 100 standard deviation 15 . Higher score BSID MDI PDI represent well cognitive motor function respectively.30 When BSID MDI/ PDI score less 50 , score extrapolate described previously.31 The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales parent-reported measure child adaptive development . The scale ass four domain adaptive development : communication , daily living skill , socialization , motor skill . The overall Adaptive Behavior Composite ( ABC ) standard score base child ’ age , high score represent well adaptive functioning . Population mean ABC 100 standard deviation 15.32 Anthropometric measurement perform neonatologist , aware infant ’ intervention assignment , use pediatric scale weight , length board length , tape measure head circumference . Growth delay define weight length le 5th percentile one year adjust age . At 1 year follow-up , research assistant review child ’ clinic chart note whether follow health condition receipt health-services : cerebral palsy , blindness , hear impairment , seizure disorder , oxygen requirement , need tracheostomy tube ventriculo-peritoneal shunt .</detailed_description>
