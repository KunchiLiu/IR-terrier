	<brief_title>Inhaled Prostacyclin Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Pulmonary hypertension , define mean PA ( pulmonary arterial ) pressure &gt; 25 mm Hg , end point variety condition . These include primary pulmonary hypertension , post-operative pulmonary hypertension result increase pulmonary vascular resistance occur ARDS . This entity distinguish hypoxemia , non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema bilateral infiltrate chest X-ray . Prostacyclin ( PGE1 ) , arachidonic acid metabolite , stable analogue , iloprost , evaluate efficacy treatment pulmonary hypertension use reduce intra-pulmonary shunting ARDS . While intravenous application iloprost cause decrease pulmonary also systemic vascular tone , aerosolize prostacyclin result selective pulmonary vasodilatation without affect systemic blood pressure demonstrate preliminary studies/reports . Furthermore , aerosolize iloprost improve gas exchange pulmonary shunt clinical setting impaired ventilation/perfusion ratio occur ARDS , due redistribution pulmonary blood flow non-ventilated ventilate , aerosol accessible lung region . Previous case report non-randomized study indicate inhalation aerosolize iloprost may offer new life save strategy intractable pulmonary hypertension ARDS . Further , advantage inhale iloprost include lack adverse reaction toxic side effect well convenient cost-effective administration . Other available therapy like nitric oxide inhalation cost , around Rs 350/liter total 34-45 liter per patient require . It also associate additional side effect , thrombocytopenia . Due irreversible nature ARDS associate high rate mortality also affect resource allocation critically ill patient , suggest carry study intensive care unit ( ICU ) , incidence &gt; 10 % result almost 90 % mortality ( ICU Quality Indicators Jan-Apr 20048 ) . Iloprost completely metabolize excretion metabolite primarily via kidney ; elimination half-life 30 minute . Inhalation therapy reduces systemic absorption hence elimination half-life . In previous study , aerosolize iloprost find effective improve functional class patient , exercise capacity improve shunting . However , large randomize trial need prove efficacy cost effective therapy patient pulmonary hypertension ARDS . Objectives : To carry prospective , double blind , randomize trial show nebulized PGE1 , stable prostacyclin derivative , decrease pulmonary hypertension selectively improve oxygenation ARDS . *ALPROSTADIL ( 20 mcg ampule ) manufacture Schering , Pakistan . Importance work : Prostacyclin ( PGE1 ) , arachidonic acid metabolite , evaluate efficacy treatment pulmonary hypertension use reduce intra-pulmonary shunting ARDS . While intravenous application PGE1 , alprostadil , cause decrease pulmonary also systemic vascular tone , aerosolize PGE1 result selective pulmonary vasodilation without affect systemic blood pressure . Furthermore , aerosolize PGE1 improve gas exchange pulmonary shunt clinical setting impaired ventilation/perfusion ratio occur ARDS , due redistribution pulmonary blood flow non-ventilated ventilate , aerosol accessible lung region . Critical review relevant literature subject : Previous case report non randomize study indicate inhalation aerosolize alprostadil may offer new life save strategy intractable pulmonary hypertension ARDS . Further , advantage inhale iloprost include lack adverse reaction toxic side effect well convenient cost-effective administration . Due irreversible nature ARDS associate high rate mortality also affect resource allocation critically ill patient , suggest carry study intensive care unit ( ICU ) , incidence &gt; 10 % result almost 90 % mortality ( ICU Quality Indicators Jan-Apr 20048 ) . In previous study , aerosolize alprostadil effective improve functional class patient , exercise capacity improve shunting . Large randomize trial need prove efficacy cost effective therapy patient pulmonary hypertension ARDS . Other available therapy like nitric oxide inhalation cost higher around Rs 350/liter total 34-45 liter per patient require . It also associate additional side effect , thrombocytopenia . Resume related work carry principal investigator co-Investigator area : The principal investigator co-investigator relevant qualification , experience expertise conduct study , obvious list recent select publication . Controls : From select patient include study random , blind manner . Patients give drug placebo determine pharmacy . Work Up : After enrol , follow test carry determine inclusion/ exclusion criterion . - Transthoracic echo - rule ejection fraction &lt; 30 % - Pulmonary embolus - Pulmonary hypertension ( TR jet ) determine echo - Arterial blood gas - CXR review determine ARDS criterion Drug Administration : Drug ( alprostadil/placebo - normal saline ) nebulized ; 5 microgram via standard nebulizer within 4 hour , . Standardization Critical Care : Standardization treatment modality incorporate methodology regard ventilatory support , inotropic support fluid management ; however , intensive care unit AKUH 'open unit ' patient primarily take care primary team critical care consultant ( PI one ) , strict guideline enforce . However give general range parameter , keep mind recommendation Society Critical Care medicine Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network . Once enrolled , patient manage ICU consultant primary physician ( may always include PI ) . The follow broad criterion follow order treat patient : 1 . Ventilatory support ARDS/Pulmonary hypertension : - Any ventilatory mode use - Peak airway pressure ( Pa ) maintain 35 mm Hg - Peep range 8-14 mm Hg - Tidal volumes 6 cc/kg 2 . Inotropic Support : Dopamine ( 5-20 mics/kg/min ) positive inotrope ( dopaminergic , alpha beta agonist activity ) norepinephrine ( 0.1-0.5 mics/kg/min ) vasopressor ( alpha agonist ) use increase blood pressure . The goal maintain mean arterial pressure ( DBP plus 1/3 rd pulse pressure ) &gt; 60 mm Hg . 3 . Fluid management : Keeping wedge pressure &lt; 20 mm Hg goal fluid management . Sample Size : Assuming total Karachi population 150,000 ( 1998 Demographic Survey Pakistan ) age group , take incidence 20 % ( +/- 105 bound error ) pulmonary hypertension ARDS 95 % confidence interval , extricate sample size 91 case ( 91 control ) . Epi-info version 1.1 used calculate sample size . Actual sample size 182 . Outcome Measures : - If meet , trial terminate early favor use drug . Positive result take PA pressure - mean PA pressure decrease 10 4 hour PaO2/FiO2 ratio - increase 50 ( PaO2 increase 10 ) 4 hour . - Results record Data Sheet - ( see Appendix I ) . Tests do : Arterial blood gas . Transthoracic echo drug . Ethics : Written approval Aga Khan University Ethics Review Committee ( ERC ) obtain prior commencement study . Blinding : Each patient enrollment assign serial number consecutively meet inclusion criterion review principal investigator research assistant . After necessary workup consent , drug shall obtain AKUH pharmacy . The pharmacy carry randomization deliver either alprostadil normal saline ( placebo ) unmarked vial . Delivery dose frequency carry similarly patient . Data collect research assistant nurse . At end trial ( case control enrol ) serial number patient match delivery chart pharmacy see whether receive drug placebo . Year wise plan work used period : All ICU patient . Inclusion exclusion ( Pulm . HTN , ARDS ) ( intubate , swan ) echo LVF , RVF , pulmonary embolus Swan ganz catheter ( wedge &lt; 20 ) consent ( serial # inform pharmacy )</detailed_description>
