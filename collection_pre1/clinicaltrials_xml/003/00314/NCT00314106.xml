	<brief_summary>Background : - In study human melanoma , patient give total body irradiation suppress immune system conjunction chemotherapy show significant clinical response . - In previous study , one-half patient give tumor-fighting cell ( cell create patient 's tumor cell grown laboratory ) show anti-tumor response . Objective : To determine whether tumor-fighting cell take melanoma tumor grown lab effectively fight melanoma patient 's immune system suppress attack . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old metastatic melanoma tumor reactive cell available . Design : -Patients assign one two group - receive prior therapy Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . After five day injection filgrastim , medicine stimulate growth white blood cell , patient undergo apheresis bone marrow harvesting , , collect stem cell later re-infusion . For apheresis , whole blood collect needle arm vein circulate cell-separating machine stem cell extract . The rest blood return needle needle arm . Bone marrow harvest do general anesthesia . Stem cell collect large needle insert hipbone.-Patients ' immune system cell bone marrow function eliminate chemotherapy ( 7 day ) total body irradiation ( 3 day ) patient 's immune system cell fight tumor-fighting cell give treatment . - 1 3 day total body irradiation , patient receive tumor-fighting cell intravenous ( IV ) infusion . After cell infuse , receive interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) infusion every 8 hour 5 day . - 2 day infusion tumor-fighting cell , patient receive stem cell collect early apheresis . - Patients evaluate 4 6 week cell infusion look tumor response treatment . Patients whose tumor grown return National Institutes Health ( NIH ) every 1 3 month blood test , scan x-ray .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : The use immunosuppression prior adoptive transfer lymphocytes tumor bear mouse base variety murine model demonstrate improve therapeutic effectiveness adoptive transfer lymphocytes follow immunosuppression host . Because degree immunosuppression highly correlate ability eliminate large tumor murine model , conduct clinical trial , 04-C-0288 , 200cGy total body irradiation use conjunction cyclophosphamide fludarabine regimen use prior adoptive cell therapy trial demonstrate significant clinical response . We measure T-regulatory cell patient participate 04-C-0288 demonstrated despite addition 200cGy total body irradiation ( TBI ) , T-regulatory cell promptly reconstitute host . Complete clinical response significantly improve adoptive cell therapy regimens . Thus , trial would like adequately test hypothesis intensive lymphodepletion increase complete response persistence transfer cell . Objective : To determine whether tumor reactive lymphocyte infuse conjunction administration high-dose IL-2 patient receive prior therapy IL-2 may result complete clinical tumor regression patient metastatic melanoma receive myeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen . To evaluate safety treatment patient receive myeloablative conditioning regimen , cell transfer IL-2 . To determine survival patient , infused cell follow administration myeloablative regimen , use analysis sequence variable region T cell receptor flow cytometry ( FACS ) . Eligibility : Patients great equal 18 year age tumor reactive cell available , metastatic melanoma , physically able tolerate high-dose IL-2 . Design : Patients assign one two cohort , receive prior therapy IL-2 . Patients receive myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen consist cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg/kg/day x 2 day IV ) , fludarabine ( 25mg/m^2/day IV X 5 day ) 1200 cGy total body irradiation ( TBI ) . Patients receive intravenous adoptive transfer tumor reactive lymphocyte ( minimum 3 X 10 ( 9 ) maximum 3 X 10 ( 11 ) lymphocyte ) follow high-dose intravenous ( IV ) IL-2 ( 720,000 IU/kg/dose every 8 hour 15 dos ) . On day 1 patient receive intravenous administration cryopreserved autologous CD34+ cell . A complete evaluation evaluable lesion conduct 4-6 week cell infusion . Patients enrol two stratum , use phase II optimal design rule modest CR rate 24 % , 33-54 patient enrol stratum .</detailed_description>

Carbon monoxide diffuse capacity ( DLCO ) great equal 60 % predict . CELL INFUSION EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Less 30 day elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , less six week since prior nitrosurea therapy . All patient ' toxicity must recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion . Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion .
