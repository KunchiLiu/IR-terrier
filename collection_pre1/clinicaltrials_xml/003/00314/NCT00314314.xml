	<brief_summary>It hypothesize intranasal administration insulin enhance hippocampal-dependent neurocognitive performance euthymic patient bipolar I II disorder . This novel initiative represent proof-of-concept study insulin salient neurocognitive function deficit bipolar disorder represent novel safe therapeutic avenue . The available literature suggest acute administration intranasal insulin enhance cognition memory impaired old adult either Alzheimer 's disease minimal cognitive impairment . Prior research demonstrate cognitive enhance effect insulin within one hour first intranasal insulin dose . Other study suggest long-term administration intranasal insulin ( i.e . eight week ) enhance memory performance human volunteer . We aim evaluate acute long-term effect intranasal insulin administration person bipolar disorder . As conduct neuropsychological test three time point , week receive insulin , within one hour first dose 8 week insulin administration .</brief_summary>
