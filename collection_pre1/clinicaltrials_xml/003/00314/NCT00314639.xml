	<brief_summary>Patients suffer schizophrenia schizophrenia spectrum psychosis frequently experience cognitive impairment . Such deficit may affect memory , attention executive function process . Many study show cognitive impairment predict daily functioning . Improvement difficulties represent major component recovery population . Second generation antipsychotic , first line intervention , show improve cognitive process compare first generation agent . However , subtle cognitive impairment may still remain . In fact , cognitive impairment one frequent subjective complaint patient family , even though antipsychotic treatment optimize . Very option available clinician try improve persistent cognitive difficulty . First , cognitive remediation technique show effectiveness result sparse come small number study . It also clear cognitive improvement obtain technique would apply daily function generalized.A second possible intervention would add pharmacological agent able improve cognition . Modafinil ( Alertec ) officially indicate improve wakefulness patient excessive daytime sleepiness associate narcolepsy . Some empirical data clinical observation suggest modafinil could improve alertness and/or cognitive functioning without exacerbate psychotic feature person schizophrenia psychotic disease spectrum schizophrenia . This study aim ( ) ass effect cognitive functioning modafinil adjunctive second generation antipsychotic prospective cohort thirty patient suffer schizophrenia psychosis spectrum schizophrenia . This study also ( b ) evaluate impact addition modafinil side effect , psychopathology symptom health parameter ( weight , metabolic profile , etc. ) . Our principal hypothesis significant improvement observe attention process without exacerbation psychotic symptom major emerge side effect . This cross-over placebo-controlled prospective study include patient schizophrenia psychosis schizophrenia spectrum accord DSM IV definition , men woman age 18 year old , item score equal 5 PANSS positive symptom subscale . At enrollment , patient experience significant cognitive difficulty score equal low Z=-1.00 Color trail test , Mesulam Weintraub Cancellation Test , Stroop test Continuous Performance Test-II . Patients expose 100mg daily Placebo Modafinil 2 week 200mg daily two following week . A two week wash period take place sequence start . Patient thus expose one month placebo one month modafinil conversely , random fashion.Assessments include neurocognitive standardized battery , psychopathological tool ( PANSS , CGI , SOFAS , SDS ) , side effect ( UKU , ESRS , DAI ) , vital sign , anthropometric metabolic profile .</brief_summary>
