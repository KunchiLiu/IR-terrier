	<brief_summary>Background : - CD4+ cell white blood cell regulate immune system control strength quality immune response . - CD25+ cell subset CD4+ cell suppress prevent immune response . - RFT-5-dgA immunotoxin ( substance kill specific cell immune system ) kill CD25+ cell . - In mouse study , RFT-5-dgA show anti-tumor activity animal study . Objective : To determine whether immune system patient metastatic melanoma ( melanoma spread beyond original site ) cause tumor shrink patient give RFT-5-dgA remove CD25+ cell . Eligibility : Patients 18 year age old metastatic melanoma whose disease progress receive standard treatment . Design : - Patients receive RFT-5-dgA vein every day total 3 dos ( one treatment course ) . Patients routine blood test week treatment . - Four 5 week last dose , patient evaluate physical examination , blood test scan x-rays evaluate tumor . - Patients whose tumor shrunk remain stable may offer additional treatment RFT-5-dgA total four course . - Patients undergo leukapheresis several tube blood drawn vein determine effect RFT-5-dgA immune system . This do first dose RFT-5-dgA , first three dos , possibly subsequent treatment course patient receive additional treatment . For leukapheresis , blood collect needle arm vein flow catheter machine separate component spin . The white cell extract rest blood return another needle arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - RFT5-dgA immunotoxin comprise IL-2Ra-specific murine IgG1 antibody RFT5 link deglycosylated ricin A chain ( dgA ) via sterically hinder heterobifunctional disulfide linker SMPT ( 4-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-a-methyl-a- ( 2-pyridyldithio ) -toluene ) . - RFT5-dgA recombinant immunotoxin selectively target CD25 express cell vivo . Further , treatment human PBMC RFT5-dgA vitro result preferential depletion CD25+ Treg cell . - Depletion Treg cell enhance tumor protection tumor-associated antigen express self antigens RFT5-dgA immunotoxin potent antitumor effect SCID mouse xenografted L540 cell express CD25 . - The MTD establish phase I trial RFT5-dgA 15mg/m ( 2 ) /course IV . Objectives : - The primary objective determine whether objective clinical response obtain patient metastatic melanoma follow administration RFT5-dgA . - Secondary objective determine whether change occur level CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell ( Treg cell ) peripheral blood treatment evaluate toxicity profile patient treat trial . Eligibility : - Patients great 18 year age measurable metastatic melanoma , expect survival great three month , progress receive standard therapy include . - Standard clinical laboratory value must normal study inclusion patient may pregnant , breast-feeding require anticoagulation . - Patients must willing undergo leukapheresis . - Patients active infection , major medical disorder , HAMA level great 1 ug/mL , prior radiotherapy extensive lung disease exclude . Design : - Patients receive 3 mg/m ( 2 ) RFT5-dgA intravenously every day total 3 dos ( one course ) . - Four five week last dose , patient undergo tumor evaluation , evaluation change T-regulatory cell ( CD4+CD25+cells Foxp3 expression ) , toxicity assessment . - One additional course may administer patient stable disease partial complete response . - Up 41 evaluable patient may accrue determine whether theRFT5-dgA produce modest response rate target 20 percent ( p1=0.20 )</detailed_description>
