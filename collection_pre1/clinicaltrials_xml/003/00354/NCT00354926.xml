	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Anti-CD20 Monoclonal Antibody ( AME-133v ) Treat Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The protein engineering AME-133v hypothesize result anti-CD20 therapy great potency efficacy patient , particularly genetically define subpopulation respond poorly rituximab express low affinity version Fc receptor immune effector cell . A monoclonal antibody increase bind receptor effective stimulating effector cell kill thus improve response antibody .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To include study protocol , subject meet follow criterion . Have morphologically confirm diagnosis CD20+ follicular Bcell nonHodgkin 's lymphoma ; Have low affinity form FcγRIIIa ( F/F F/V position 158 ) determine FcR genotyping ; Have measurable disease . Measurable mass ( enlarge lymph node ) must clearly define bidimensional diameter least 1.5 x 1.5 cm physical examination ≤ 1.5 cm one dimension CT , MRI , plain radiograph ; Have receive prior treatment chemotherapy give without rituximab ; OR , Have relapse progress within 120 day ( inclusive ) last infusion rituximab ; Be 18 year age great ; Have negative pregnancy test , relevant . Women childbearing potential ( postmenopausal least one year surgically incapable bear child ) must agree become pregnant duration study . To , must agree use medically acceptable contraceptive regimen ; Have performance status 0 2 ECOG performance scale ; Have adequate hematopoietic , renal , hepatic function define : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count great 1,500/mm³ ; 2 . Platelet count great 75,000/mm³ ; 3 . Hemoglobin least 8 g/dL ; 4 . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ; 5 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal ; 6 . ALT ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ; 7 . Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 1.5x upper limit normal . No evidence hepatitis B C infection ( detectable HBV DNA HCV RNA ) ; Have discontinue previous therapy cancer , include chemotherapy , radiotherapy , investigational therapy least 30 day prior study enrollment ; Have discontinue highdose corticosteroid therapy least 30 day prior study enrollment ( ≤ 10 mg/day Prednisone equivalent allowable ) ; Have life expectancy 3 month ; Be able give write informed consent . Subjects follow exclusion allow participate study . Allergy monoclonal antibody study drug component ; Concurrent malignancy could complicate interpretation response evaluation , include histologic evidence diffuse Bcell lymphoma . Nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix exclusion ; Significant cardiac disease ( e.g . NYHA CHF class III IV , history MI within one year prior study Day 1 , unstable angina , uncontrolled hypertension , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia ( CTCAE Grade 2 high ) , clinically significant baseline ECG MUGA abnormality . Positive test serum cardiac troponins ( cTnI cTnT assay ; special processing require , assay must use throughout study ; see Study Reference Manual ) Active infection require oral i.v . antibiotic ; Administration blood transfusion red blood cell growth factor within 10 day precede enrollment protocol ; Administration white cell growth factor within 28 day precede enrollment protocol ; Concomitant nonmalignant disease ( ) could interfere implementation protocol , make study result difficult interpret , represent additional safety risk ; History HIVassociated nonHodgkin 's lymphoma .</criteria>
