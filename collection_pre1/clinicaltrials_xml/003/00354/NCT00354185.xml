	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose give PDX101 together 17-AAG treating patient metastatic unresectable solid tumor lymphoma . PDX101 may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving PXD101 together 17-AAG may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability PXD101 17-AAG administer patient refractory solid tumor malignancy . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose PXD101 17-AAG patient refractory solid tumor malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetics PXD101 17-AAG patient receive combination . II . To evaluate antitumor activity combination , per tumor measurement use RECIST criterion . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect treatment PXD101 17-AAG transcriptional upregulation target gene tumor surrogate tissue ( PBMCs ) mean RTPCR incorporation chromatin immunoprecipitation assay . II . To evaluate effect combination treatment post translational modification histone tumor surrogate tissue ( PBMCs ) . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin ( 17-AAG ) IV 2 hour day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 PXD101 IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos 17-AAG PDX101 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Up 12 patient treated MTD . Patients undergo blood collection day 1 4 course 1 pharmacokinetic study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 36 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
