	<brief_summary>Objectives : 1 . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) 12 month subject metastatic colorectal cancer receive FOLFIRI [ folinic acid ( leucovorin LV ) , 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , irinotecan ) plus bevacizumab first line treatment . 2 . To determine objective response rate duration objective response population . 3 . To assess overall survival ( OS ) population . 4 . To measure effect treatment intratumoral blood volume microvascular permeability dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) consent patient technically feasible . 5 . To correlate plasma proteomics response . 6 . To assess safety regimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study FOLFIRI Plus Bevacizumab Colorectal Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer growth may affect protein body call `` vascular endothelial growth factor '' ( VEGF ) . A drug block VEGF may effective treatment colorectal cancer . Bevacizumab design block VEGF . Bevacizumab add 5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , leucovorin ( LV ) , irinotecan , drug combination routinely use treatment advanced colorectal cancer . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test '' . These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You ask question medical history medication currently take take past . You complete physical exam heart rate , temperature , breathe rate , blood pressure , height , weight measure . You ask ability perform every day activity . You electrocardiogram ( ECG - test measure electrical activity heart ) . You chest x-ray scan ( either compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ) abdomen pelvis evaluate cancer . Scans part body also may take doctor think need evaluate cancer . Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) urine sample collect routine test , include complete blood count , carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) level ( marker cancer ) , chemistry profile . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test If screening evaluation show eligible take part study , may begin treatment Study treatment repeat every 2 week ( 14 day ) . Each 14-day period treatment call `` cycle '' therapy . You must receive study treatment M. D. Anderson . All study drug give needle vein . For first treatment , receive bevacizumab alone first . The first dose bevacizumab give 90 minute . If reaction ( fever/chills ) , next dose give 60 minute , reaction occurs , dose give 30 minute . If experience reaction bevacizumab infusion , may give acetaminophen ( Tylenol ) mouth and/or antihistamine vein 30 minute dose help decrease risk reaction . Fourteen ( 14 ) day later future cycle , receive bevacizumab , LV , irinotecan give Day 1 cycle . 5-FU give 46 hour Days 1-3 . Bevacizumab give described . When bevacizumab infusion end , receive LV irinotecan , starting time . You receive irinotecan 90 minute LV 2 hour . When LV infusion end , 5-FU give 2 4 minute . This follow 5-FU give 46 hour use small portable pump ( size standard paperback book ) . Before new cycle study treatment , ask question side effect may medications currently take take since last saw study doctor . You complete physical exam , include measurement blood pressure , pulse , temperature , weight . You ask ability perform every day task . About 3 tablespoon blood take routine laboratory test . These test include complete blood count chemistry profile . A urine sample take every cycle treatment . During first cycle treatment , Day 8 , sample blood ( 3 teaspoon ) drawn . This test may do lab close home . You also either CT scan MRI tumor ( ) every 8 week end study treatment . About 1 tablespoon blood take check CEA level time scan do . Additional test may do study doctor feel necessary care . Except weekly blood test , may do lab close home , test evaluation must do M. D. Anderson . If experience severe side effect , treatment may delay , stop , may receive small dos treatment . You may continue receive study treatment unless disease get bad , decide take part longer , doctor decides best interest stop treatment . When stop study treatment , ask test evaluation do end study visit . Urine 3 tablespoon blood take routine laboratory test , include complete blood count , CEA level , chemistry profile . You also physical exam . CT scan MRI scan abdomen pelvis also do check size location disease . Once stop receiving study treatment , study doctor nurse continue check , either clinic telephone stop come M. D. Anderson , every 3 month rest life . This investigational study . The drug use study approve FDA treatment advance colorectal cancer . Up 43 patient take part multicenter study . About 38 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
