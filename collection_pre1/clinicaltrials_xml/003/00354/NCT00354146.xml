	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Study Farnesyl Transferase Inhibitor ( R115777 , Tipifarnib ) Patients With Refractory Relapsed Acute Myeloid Leukemia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) account approximately 25 % case leukemia diagnosed Western hemisphere . First-line chemotherapy regimen induce complete remission 55-75 % patient . However , 50 % 70 % patient achieve remission relapse . Current therapy patient refractory initial therapy relapse within 6 month remission unsatisfactory complete remission rate low remission duration brief . New drug novel mechanism action may beneficial currently available one . Tipifarnib represent new class oncology drug specific cellular target ( inhibition farnesyl transferase protein ) , one component Ras oncogene , specific mechanism acton . It believe inhibition protein lead decrease cellular proliferation cell death . This open-label , multicenter , non-comparative phase 2 study investigate efficacy safety farnesyl transferase inhibition tipifarnib administer orally single agent , twice daily , first 21 day every 28 day cycle . Patients enrol disease status two cohort ; Cohort 1 include patient relapse AML Cohort 2 , patient refractory AML . All patient treat sufficient length time determine response study medication ( effectiveness ) evaluate rate complete remission ( CR ) complete remission incomplete platelet recovery ( CRp ) , duration complete remission , time disease progression progression-free survival , overall survival , characterize clinical benefit quality life ( QOL ) . The safety profile tipifarnib also determine patient refractory relapse AML.. The patient receive six tablet ( 100 mg ) tipifarnib twice daily 21 28 day cycle ( 7 day rest period cycle ) . Patients may receive tipifarnib disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur .</detailed_description>
