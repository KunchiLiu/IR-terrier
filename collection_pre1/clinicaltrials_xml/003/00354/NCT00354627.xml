	<brief_summary>The purpose study provide early access TMC125 HIV-1 infect patient fail multiple antiretroviral ( ARV ) regimens . Information safety tolerability aspects TMC125 combination ARVs treatment-experienced HIV-1 patient limit treatment option assess . Available data regard effectiveness drug also collect . To eligible , patient fail current ARV regimen treatment interruption , previously receive 2 different protease inhibitor ( PI ) contain regimen least 3-class experienced ( protease inhibitor [ PI ] , nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ N [ ] RTIs ] non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NNRTIs ] ) least 2-class experienced ( PIs N [ ] RTIs ) primary NNRTI resistance . TMC125 administer combination investigator-selected background additional ARVs list allow medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The TMC125-C214 Study Provides Early Access TMC125 HIV-1 Infected Patients Who Have Failed Multiple Antiretroviral Regimens Will Also Gather Information Long-term Safety Tolerability TMC125 Combined With Other Antiretroviral Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label trial primary objective provide early access TMC125 treatment-experienced HIV-1 infect patient fail multiple antiretroviral ( ARV ) regimens limited treatment option currently approve ARVs . The secondary objective trial gather information safety tolerability aspects TMC125 combination ARVs . Available efficacy data also collect . Patients least 3-class experienced 2-class experience primary non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) resistance . They also previously receive 2 different protease inhibitor-based regimen ( low-dose ritonavir count protease inhibitor ( PI ) regimen ) , treatment interruption virologically suppress current regimen , able use currently approve NNRTIs due resistance ( primary acquire ) and/or intolerance . Patients must also meet in- exclusion criterion . TMC125 ( 200mg twice daily ) provide patient confirm eligible entry . Once treatment TMC125 combination ARVs initiate , patient must instruct follow recommended visit schedule base routine clinical care . Safety tolerability entire antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) regimen , include TMC125 , monitor investigator per standard clinical practice . However , recommend visit plan 4 12 week follow initiation TMC125 combination ARVs every 12 week thereafter therapy trial . Adverse event ( AEs ) lead treatment interruption discontinuation serious adverse event ( SAEs ) , exception Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) define illness ( CDC class C ) unless fatal consider related TMC125 , collect . Other adverse event collect require per local regulation . The background ARVs may change time trial , discretion investigator due development resistance , intolerance , toxicity , etc . continue treatment TMC125 investigator 's assessment patient still benefit treatment TMC125 . If change background regimen make , recommend follow-up visit plan 4 week change therapy . Treatment investigational medication continue virologic failure , treatment-limiting toxicity , subject lose follow-up , patient 's withdrawal , pregnancy , discontinuation TMC125 development TMC125 become commercially available patient 's country . Patients instruct orally take two 100 mg tablet TMC125 follow meal every 12 hour . TMC125 ( 200 mg twice daily ) must use combination antiretroviral drug . Treatment investigational medication continue virologic failure , treatment-limiting toxicity , patient lose follow-up , withdrawal , pregnancy , discontinuation TMC125 development TMC125 become commercially available patient 's country .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient least 3class experienced ( 3 class license oral antiretrovirals : nucleoside/tide reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ N [ ] RTI ] , protease inhibitor [ PI ] , nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor [ NNRTI ] ) Patients primary NNRTI resistance include experience least 2 class ARVs ( PIs , N [ ] RTIs ) meet inclusion criterion Patient previously receive 2 different PIbased regimen Patient unable use currently approve NNRTIs due resistance ( primary acquire ) and/or intolerance Patient , currently receive ARV regimen , achieve adequate virologic suppression his/her current regimen . Prior current participation DUET trial ( TMC125C206 TMC125C216 ) . Use disallow concomitant therapy , include disallow antiretrovirals ( ARV ) Use investigational ARVs ( exception ) Any active clinically significant disease ( e.g. , cardiac dysfunction , pancreatitis , acute viral infection ) finding screen medical history physical examination either resolve stabilize least 30 day Screening Phase Pregnant breastfeed female Female patient childbearing potential use effective nonhormonal birth control method Patients specific laboratory abnormality Patients clinical laboratory evidence significantly decrease hepatic function decompensation .</criteria>
