	<brief_title>Ispinesib Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy SB-715992 patient advance renal cell cancer receive least one prior therapy . This achieve multi-center , single arm phase II study evaluate proportion patient achieve complete partial response agent . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess overall survival . II . To assess time progression . III . To evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive ispinesib ( SB-715992 ) IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
