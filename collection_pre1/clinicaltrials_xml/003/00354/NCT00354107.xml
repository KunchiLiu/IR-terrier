	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose SGN-30 give together ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide see well work treat young patient recurrent anaplastic large cell lymphoma . Drugs use chemotherapy , ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , SGN-30 , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Define describe toxicity monoclonal antibody SGN-30 alone ( window ) combination ifosfamide , carboplatin , etoposide ( ICE ) pediatric patient CD30-positive recurrent anaplastic large cell lymphoma . II . Define , preliminarily , antitumor activity monoclonal antibody SGN-30 alone ( window ) combination ICE patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Characterize pharmacokinetics monoclonal antibody SGN-30 patient . II . Characterize soluble CD30 concentration time relapse patient . III . Characterize development human antichimeric antibody patient . IV . Measure minimal residual disease patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , pilot , phase I , dose-finding study monoclonal antibody SGN-30 follow phase II study . Patients receive monoclonal antibody SGN-30 IV alone day 1 week 1-8 . Beginning week 5 , patient receive ICE chemotherapy comprise ifosfamide IV 2 hour day 1-3 , carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-3 . Treatment ICE repeat every 3 week 6 courses** absence unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive intrathecal therapy comprise methotrexate , cytarabine , hydrocortisone day 29 ( week 5 ) . NOTE : **Patients plan undergo bone marrow transplantation ( BMT ) receive 2 course ICE undergo BMT study . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive pre-determined dose monoclonal antibody SGN-30 possible dose de-escalation 1 dose level event ≥ 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . The dose ≤ 1 6 patient experience DLT use phase II study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
