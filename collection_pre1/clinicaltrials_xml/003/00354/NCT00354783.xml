	<brief_summary>The purpose one-year follow-up study twofold : ( 1 ) prospectively examine spontaneous kicking support stepping movement VLBW premature infant attainment independent walking ; ( 2 ) ass factor ( i.e . gross motor development , cardiopulmonary function , anthropometry , body composition cognition ) could potentially influence walk attainment VLBW premature infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuity Leg Movements VLBW Premature Infants : From Spontaneous Kicking Supported Stepping Independent Walking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Very low birth weight ( VLBW ) preterm infant ( birth weight &lt; 1,500g ) sustain high risk neuromotor disability , exemplify delay walk attainment . Spontaneous kick support step propose early precursor independent walking . The continuity early leg movement independent walk establish normal term infant , relation remain unclear VLBE premature infant . Therefore , purpose one-year follow-up study twofold : ( 1 ) prospectively examine spontaneous kicking support stepping movement VLBW premature infant attainment independent walking ; ( 2 ) ass factor ( i.e . gross motor development , cardiopulmonary function , anthropometry , body composition cognition ) could potentially influence walk attainment VLBW premature infant . This study enroll 15 VLBW premature infant born National Taiwan University Hospital . Infants schedule spontaneous kick examination 2 4 month correct age , follow support step examination 9 11 month correct age record age walk attainment . Age walk attainment define time child first able move five successive step without support . At visit , infant examine spontaneous kicking support step movement ( three-dimensional kinematic analysis Peak Motion Analysis System ) , gross motor function ( Alberta Infant Motor Scale ) , cardiopulmonary function ( pulsed oxymeter ) , anthropometry ( scale tape measure ) , body composition ( Pediatric Plicometric System ) cognition ( Chinese Child Development Inventory- Cognitive Subscale ) . The result study provide important information help reveal maturation process early leg movement prior walk attainment premature infant . Furthermore , identify early neuromotor marker influence factor walk attainment provide physical therapist useful guidance make early treatment plan premature infant develop motor delay .</detailed_description>
