	<brief_summary>Background/Aim : To evaluate optimal dosage rabeprazole proton-pump inhibitor ( PPI ) test gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) test influence cytochrome P ( CYP ) 2C19 polymorphism population high prevalence people poorly metabolize PPIs . Patients Methods : In randomize , open-label trial , patient symptoms suggestive GERD randomize receive two-week test 20-mg 40-mg rabeprazole diagnostic endoscopy . Symptom response assess four-grade daily record ; addition , DNA peripheral blood leukocyte genotyped CYP2C19 polymorphism polymerase chain reaction-restrict fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) technique .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION A broad spectrum symptom commonly associate gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , incidence roughly 20 % general population . [ 1 ] Despite recent , substantial advance understand GERD 's pathogenesis , diagnosis still present many challenge . A rapid symptomatic response proton pump inhibitor ( PPIs ) patient presumptive diagnosis GERD useful validate diagnosis , know PPI test . Studies address diagnostic PPI test produce valuable estimate Western population regard prediction GERD individual patient . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Some population-specific feature distinguish Asian patient Western counterpart . First , majority ( 75-90 % ) Asian reflux patient endoscopy-negative reflux disease ( ENRD ) . [ 1 ] [ 5 ] Not demonstrate favorable response PPI treatment pathogenesis ENRD part associate psychosomatic pathway . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Second , PPIs eliminate hepatic route , polymorphically express cytochrome P ( CYP ) 2C19 primarily responsible rate metabolism . [ 8 ] Compared people homozygous wild-type genotype , people variant CYP2C19 allele exhibit low rate PPI degradation , high plasma PPI concentration ( 3-to-13 time higher ) , less degree gastric acid secretion . [ 9 ] The prevalence people poor metabolizers ( i.e. , homozygous variant genotype ) cite 1.2 % 3.8 % Caucasian-European population , 12.6 % 22.5 % Asian population . [ 10 ] Lower gastric parietal cell mass also prevalent Asians . These characteristic may augment therapeutic effect PPIs Asian patient . When consider pro con PPI test Asian population , major pro high prevalence poor intermediate metabolizers may increase serum level PPI , result high sensitivity , low require dose PPI , less cost testing . The con mainly relate increased proportion ENRD patient . Up 50 % ENRD patient , whose condition term functional heartburn , report sufficient heartburn relief PPI treatment . [ 6 ] [ 11 ] Therefore , high proportion false positive case may occur , lead decrease test specificity . The prediction intra-esophageal damage paramount importance patient erosive non-erosive disease distinctive manifestation prognosis . [ 12 ] Therefore , study , test hypothesis PPI test use valid tool diagnosis esophagitis Chinese population . Validation accuracy PPI test would provide important information comparison diagnosis traditional endoscopy-first approach . We select rabeprazole PPI test agent well tolerate effectively prevent pathological symptomatic GERD relapse . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Another potential benefit variable proportion rabeprazole degradation proceeds non-enzymatic pathway . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Thus , decrease inter-individual variability serum PPI level may prove rabeprazole-based regimen diagnostic test stable accuracy . PATIENTS &amp; METHODS Patients A consecutive series patient symptoms suggestive GERD enrol Gastroenterology outpatient clinic institution . The typical GERD symptom define heartburn and/or acid regurgitation least three episode per week minimum three month . Patients receive concurrent PPI treatment , medical contraindication rabeprazole therapy , report history peptic ulcer disease gastrointestinal surgery , peptic ulcer disease malignancy proven endoscopy , presence alarm feature ( e.g. , dysphagia , weight loss , bleeding , abdominal mass , and/or anemia ) , unwilling unable provide inform consent exclude study . Participants provide informed consent , Ethics Committee National Taiwan University Hospital approve study protocol prior implementation ( . 940711 ) . Study Protocol All enrol patient underwent initial diagnostic evaluation upper endoscopy classify erosive non-erosive disease . After endoscopy , patient two group randomly assign receive either one tablet rabeprazole 20mg breakfast two tablet rabeprazole breakfast dinner 2 week . The random allocation perform choose card seal envelope . Patient response PPI treatment record diary ( illustrate ) . Patients notify endoscopy result study completion . Endoscopy After overnight fast , subject place left lateral decubitus position . Endoscopy perform experienced endoscopists academic institution . During procedure , stomach duodenum inspect exclude possible lesion . The distal portion esophagus evaluate carefully determine presence mucosal injury . The definition reflux esophagitis rest demonstration diffuse streak erythema , mucosal friability , presence erosion ulcer , i.e. , mucosal break . Severity assess accord Los Angeles ( LA ) classification standard comparator photo , reference standard diagnosis GERD . [ 17 ] Symptom Assessment Patients keep daily diary record severity reflux symptom 14 day PPI therapy . The evaluation scale adapt scale use Dickman trial [ 18 ] translate Chinese . The scale follow : ( 1 ) mild symptom easily tolerate last long ; ( 2 ) moderate symptom cause discomfort interfere usual activity ; ( 3 ) severe symptom cause much discomfort interfere usual activity ; ( 4 ) disabling symptom unbearable interfered considerably usual activity . Analyses CYP2C19 Genotypes For genotype analysis , patient 's peripheral blood leukocyte obtain DNA extract . Genotyping procedure identify CYP2C19 wild-type allele two know mutant allele , CYP2C19m1 exon 5 CYP2C19m2 exon 4 , carry polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism ( PCR-RFLP ) technique allele-specific primer . [ 19 ] On basis ability metabolize PPI , individual classify extensive metabolizers ( homEM : homozygous wild-type allele ) , heterozygous extensive metabolizers ( hetEM : carrier one mutant allele ) , poor metabolizers ( PM : homozygous variant allele ) . All laboratory procedure perform blind patient 's randomization status . Statistical Analysis Quantitative data summarize mean Â± standard deviation ( SD ) , categorical variable summarize percentage . Between study group , categorical variable compare 2 test , quantitative data independent t-test , ordinal data Wilcoxon 's two-sample test . To identify best cutoff value symptom reduction prediction GERD , compare three level positive response ( 25 % , 50 % , 75 % symptom reduction baseline ) calculate area receiver-operating curve ( ROC ) prediction model . In model , dependent variable diagnosis GERD , positive therapeutic response treat main independent variable . Covariants include age , male gender , body mass index ( BMI ) , social habit ( e.g. , smoke alcohol ) , know associate risk GERD . [ 1 ] According best definition positive response , diagnostic parameter calculate sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value ( PPV ) , negative predictive value ( NPV ) , accuracy . To assess effect CYP2C19 polymorphic genotype , result stratify compare accord carrier status ( e.g. , homEM , hetEM , PM ) . The Cochran-Armitage trend test assess whether therapeutic difference across three genotype class . All P value two side , P &lt; 0.05 indicate statistical significance . Analyses perform statistical software ( SAS , version 8.0 ; SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC ) .</detailed_description>
