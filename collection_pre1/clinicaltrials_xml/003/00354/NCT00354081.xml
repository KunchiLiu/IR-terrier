	<brief_summary>PURPOSE OF STUDY Observational study demonstrate elevated level plasma total homocysteine risk factor cardiovascular disease . The purpose trial evaluate clinical effect homocysteine lower treatment B vitamins 3-5 year follow-up patient undergoing cardiac catheterization suspect coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Special attention give complication rate among patient need subsequent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PCI ) coronary artery by-pass grafting ( CABG ) . HYPOTHESIS The primary hypothesis study , among patient CAD , daily supplement B vitamins reduce risk cardiovascular mortality serious cardiovascular event least 20 % . The secondary hypothesis study , among patient CAD , daily supplement B vitamins reduce risk total mortality , coronary event , cerebrovascular event cardiovascular event . The hypothesis test effect treatment ( folic acid / vitamin B12 B6 ) , effect evaluate accord initial total homocysteine level B vitamin level well change level 1 6 month . The sample size calculated 3088 patient use two-sided chi-square test significance 0.05 80 % power level , presumed event rate 22 % 4 year , event rate reduction 20 % , adjust non-compliance/drop-out 20 % . STUDY DESIGN This control , double-blind two-centre trial 3090 include men woman underwent coronary angiography Haukeland University Hospital Stavanger University Hospital April 1999 April 2004 . At baseline 1300 patient underwent PCI 600 underwent CABG . The patient randomize 4 group 2 x 2 factorial design receive one follow four treatment : A , folic acid 0.8 mg plus vitamin B12 0.4 mg vitamin B6 40 mg per day ; B , folic acid 0.8 mg plus vitamin B12 0.4 mg per day ; C , vitamin B6 40 mg per day ; D , placebo . The active drug placebo tablet identical appearance taste . Treatment start soon patient randomize coronary angiography procedure . The patient undergoing interview , clinical examination blood-sampling baseline , follow-up 1 month 1 year , final study visit . In addition , information dietary habit obtain 2400 patient baseline . Among 350 patient undergone PCI baseline , full clinical examination , blood sample repeat coronary angiography ass re-stenosis perform 9 ( 6-12 ) month PCI procedure . For patient , angiogram suitable quantitative coronary angiography ( QCA ) analysis obtain baseline follow-up invasive procedure . The follow-up terminate ahead schedule October 2005 due lack compliance participant cause medium report NORVIT study ( NCT00266487 ) potential increase cancer risk associate B vitamin supplementation . The patient follow 1.5 - 5 year . STUDY END POINTS Primary clinical endpoint follow-up cause death , non-fatal acute myocardial infarction , acute hospitalization unstable angina non-fatal thromboembolic stroke ( infarction ) . Secondary endpoint fatal non-fatal acute myocardial infarction ( include procedure relate myocardial infarction ) , acute hospitalization angina , stable angina angiographic verified progression , myocardial revascularization , fatal non-fatal thromboembolic stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) one common disease , despite decline mortality acute coronary syndrome Western world , CAD remain important cause death Norway . HOMOCYSTEINE Homocysteine ( Hcy ) amino acid total homocysteine ( tHcy ) sum several different form Hcy present blood , usually measure serum plasma . A population-based study plasma tHcy 18,043 individual Hordaland , Norway demonstrate plasma tHcy usually 5 15 micromol/L , high men woman increase age [ Nygård , et al. , 1995 ] . FOLIC ACID The common cause elevate tHcy low intake folic acid ( B vitamin ) occur many fruit , vegetable , liver product , milk , bread . Vitamin supplement sell without prescription commonly contain folic acid ( 0.1 0.2 mg Norway , 0.4 0.8 mg country ) . In United States United Kingdom many food product fortify folic acid . The Food Drug administration United States make fortification folic acid mandatory product 1998 . The rationale policy reduce occurrence neural tube defect , class serious congenital malformation . Several study also show direct relation serum folic acid coronary heart disease . MODERATELY ELEVATED tHcy AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE More twenty retrospective three prospective study , include two Norwegian [ Nygård , et al. , 1997 ] , past twenty year demonstrate relation tHcy measure serum plasma coronary heart disease , peripheral artery disease stroke [ Boushey , et al. , 1995 , Ueland , et al. , 1992 ] . The meta-analysis perform Boushey et al [ Boushey , et al. , 1995 ] estimate 5 micromol/L difference tHcy increase risk coronary artery disease 60 % . Common cause moderately elevated tHcy include nutritional deficiency folic acid , vitamin B6 B12 , genetic variation gene cod key enzyme Hcy metabolism ( e.g. , thermolabile MTHFR ) , demonstrate Hordaland Homocysteine Study [ Nygård , et al. , 1995 ] , life-style factor smoking , coffee drinking exercise . VITAMIN THERAPY A common feature individual elevate tHcy responsiveness folic acid therapy . One exception vitamin B12 deficiency need correct appropriate therapy . A recent meta-analysis show mean tHcy lower effect folic acid dose 0.5-5.0 mg/day 25 % tHcy level 12 micromol/L [ Homocysteine Lowering Trialists ' Collaboration , 1998 # 1892 ] . The study show absolute percentage reduction tHcy high subject higher tHcy level particular low folic acid concentration . Moreover , additional daily oral therapy 0,5 mg B12 seem small significant additional tHcy lower effect whereas vitamin B6 mean dose 16,5 mg daily effect basal tHcy level . RANDOMIZED TRIALS WITH FOLIC ACID There solid evidence tHcy associate cardiovascular disease . We know tHcy easily lower folic acid patient , know folic acid prevent cardiovascular disease complication disease randomize double-blind trial carry . The possible problem folic acid may correct anemia , neuropathy , vitamin B12 deficiency . This necessitate careful screen B12 deficiency combine folic acid B12 sufficient oral dose treat occasional pernicious anemia . RANDOMIZED TRIALS WITH VITAMIN B6 Data several study show inappropriate vitamin B6 status strong risk factor cardiovascular disease increase risk probably independent tHcy level . Thus , commonly apply tHcy lower regimen combine folic acid vitamin B6 apply test homocysteine theory atherosclerosis . HOMOCYSTEINE AND VITAMIN MEASUREMENTS Determination tHcy associate amino acid B vitamin perform Department Pharmacology University Bergen . These analysis do patient randomization follow-up 1 month 1 year , serve monitor compliance also give possibility relate clinical event , example , amount reduction plasma tHcy .
