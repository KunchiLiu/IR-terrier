	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , carboplatin , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together erlotinib follow cisplatin carboplatin gemcitabine disease progression may effective treatment non-small cell lung cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together erlotinib follow cisplatin carboplatin gemcitabine work treat patient newly diagnose recurrent stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Erlotinib Followed Cisplatin Carboplatin Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Recurrent Stage IIIB Stage IV NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess efficacy bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride initial therapy patient newly diagnose recurrent stage IIIB IV non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Secondary - Assess safety bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride initial therapy patient . - Assess quality life ( QOL ) patient treat bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride . - Assess efficacy safety subsequent cisplatin carboplatin combination gemcitabine hydrochloride patient disease progression . - Assess QOL patient treat subsequent cisplatin carboplatin combination gemcitabine hydrochloride disease progression . Tertiary - Identify novel biomarkers predict response therapy toxicity patient treat bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride initial therapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter , prospective , open-label study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 90 minute day 1 oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning within 3 week document disease progression , patient receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . They also receive cisplatin IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride either cisplatin carboplatin repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline periodically study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 101 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
