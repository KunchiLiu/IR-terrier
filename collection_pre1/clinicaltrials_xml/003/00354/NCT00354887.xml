	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin chemotherapy drug design destroy cancer cell interfere DNA function , necessary growth new cell . Capecitabine chemotherapy drug design destroy cancer cell interfere cell division , important growth cancer . You receive 14 day treatment follow 7 day without treatment , 21 day , otherwise know `` cycle '' therapy . On Day 1 cycle , receive oxaliplatin injected vein period 2 hour . For injection , need small tube insert vein skin chest ( central venous line ) receive oxaliplatin . Oxaliplatin must give M.D . Anderson . You take capecitabine tablet twice day first two week ( Days 1-14 ) 3-week cycle . No treatment give next 7 day . You must take capecitabine within 30 minute breakfast dinner , morning evening dose 12 hour apart . You take capecitabine mouth water , fruit juice . At first treatment visit every 3 week , receive enough capecitabine last next visit . At visit , must return capecitabine use well empty bottle . During Cycle 1 , routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon blood ) do week . Before new cycle therapy , complete physical exam blood ( 2 Â½ teaspoon ) collect routine test . You ask study doctor medication take since start study drug health problem may experience . Also , x-ray compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest either CT scan magnetic resonance imaging ( MRIs ) tumor ( ) every 3 cycle end study . Additional test may do study doctor feel necessary care . This study require receive least 3 cycle treatment . However , experience severe side effect disease become bad , treatment may delay , stop , may receive small dos treatment . You may continue receive treatment study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If happens , take study doctor discus treatment option . When stop take part study , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) collect routine test . You physical exam either CT scan MRI check status disease . You contact phone every three month rest life check state health ask symptom may experience . This investigational study . The drug oxaliplatin capecitabine FDA approve treatment advance cancer colon rectum . The drug approve small bowel ampulla Vater cancer . Their use together study investigational . Up 30 people take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma small bowel ampulla Vater either unresectable metastatic . 2 . Patients must measurable disease per modify Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . 3 . Patients may previously untreated receive previous systemic therapy , limit 5FU/leucovorin capecitabine , adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy radiosensitizer . Patients may receive capecitabine 5FU administered radiosensitizing agent concurrently external beam radiotherapy preoperative postoperative therapy . Patients may receive capecitabine 5FU/leucovorin part adjuvant chemotherapy . 4 . If radiation previously receive , measurable disease must outside previous radiation field . 5 . A minimum 4 week must elapse since completion prior chemotherapy radiotherapy . A minimum 4 week must elapse since prior surgery . 6 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status less equal 2 . 7 . Adequate bone marrow function define absolute peripheral granulocyte count great equal 1500 mm3 , platelet count great equal 1500 mm3 , hemoglobin great equal 10 gm/dL . 8 . Adequate renal function , define serum creatinine less equal 1.5 * ULN calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min . 9 . Patients must adequate hepatic function : total bilirubin less equal 1.5 gm/dL ; serum albumin great equal 2.5 gm/dL . If patient liver metastasis , transaminase may 2 * ULN . If patient liver metastasis , transaminases 5 * Upper Limit Normal ( ULN ) allow . 10 . Negative urine serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential , within one week prior initiation treatment . 11 . The effect combination oxaliplatin capecitabine develop fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . 12 . Patients must sign Informed Consent Authorization indicate aware investigational nature study know risk involve . 13 . Age great equal 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use XELOX patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study . 14 . Patients take therapeutic dos coumarinderivative anticoagulant switch lowmolecularweight heparin ( LMWH ) . Lowdose Coumadin ( e.g . 1 mg mouth ( PO ) per day ) patient indwell venous access device allow . 1 . Patients prior exposure platinum therapy exclude . Patients receive prior chemotherapy metastatic disease exclude . 2 . Patients chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas Mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 3 . Patients may receive investigational agent receive investigational drug 30 day prior enrollment . 4 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis risk progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 5 . Gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation . Prior surgical therapy affect absorption . 6 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 7 . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction XELOX . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . 8 . Patients extensive symptomatic fibrosis lung . 9 . Peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 . 10 . Known Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency ( DPD deficiency ) 11 . Patients receive therapeutic dos coumarinderivative anticoagulant therapy exclude since drug interaction capecitabine coumarin anticoagulant report . Patients require anticoagulation may safely switch LMWH eligible .</criteria>
