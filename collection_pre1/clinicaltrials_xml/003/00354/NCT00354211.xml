	<brief_title>Using Minimally Invasive Cardiac Output Data vs. Standard Care Patients Emergently Admitted Intensive Care Unit Who Are Hemodynamically Unstable</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemodynamic instability first 24-hours Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) admission associate increase risk subsequent morbidity mortality . Goal-directed hemodynamic support successfully use variety patient improve outcome . In contrast , similar therapeutic approach apply later , patient establish multi-organ failure , beneficial effect may even worsen outcome . It conceivable window opportunity phase hemodynamic instability therapeutic intervention great potential influence subsequent course critical illness . Large scale us therapeutic protocol early intervention hamper logistic problem . The burden instal invasive hemodynamic monitoring protocol labor intensive require continuous presence personnel thorough understand complex physiology . Various technique introduce monitoring cardiac output , stroke volume , surrogates . The disadvantage technology far include user dependence measurement result , need calibration , limitation applicability . Edwards Lifesciences develop new algorithm determination cardiac output use arterial pressure data . The FloTrac™ system , include FloTrac™ sensor Vigileo™ monitor , utilized capture arterial pressure-based cardiac output measurement , hereinafter refer APCO ( Arterial Pressure Cardiac Output ) . This system use exist arterial catheter ( placed femoral radial artery ) require calibration external reference method . We hypothesize use FloTrac™ system continuously monitor cardiac output , addition traditional vital sign , cardiovascular instability identify earlier result earlier intervention . In addition , follow early diagnosis , precise intervention available . If achieve , patient likely show well outcomes reduced length hospital stay , ICU time , Mechanical Ventilation time , incidence renal compromise , relate morbidity/mortality need less ICUresources .</detailed_description>
