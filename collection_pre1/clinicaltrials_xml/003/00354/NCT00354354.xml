	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The reduction dynamic hyperinflation negative effect respiratory system follow bronchodilator could lead improvement cardiac function term increase cardiac output . This may enhance oxygen delivery exercise muscle COPD patient . Bronchodilator administration may also indirect effect V'O2 kinetics via action cardiovascular pulmonary variable . Objectives : 1 . To evaluate effect bronchodilator V ' E , V'CO2 , V'O2 kinetics COPD constant work-rate cycle exercise , evaluate whether bronchodilator accelerate , indirectly , phase 2 kinetics ( usually slow COPD patient normal subject ) shorten V ' E , V'CO2 , V'O2 shorten half-times HR O2 pulse , thus show improvement oxygen transport peripheral active muscle . 2 . To determine impact bronchodilator-induced reduction dynamic hyperinflation , effect cardiovascular pulmonary function , exercise limitation COPD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bronchodilators Oxygen Kinetics With Exercise Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The inability engage usual activity daily live one distressing experience people afflict Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . Exercise intolerance progress relentlessly disease advance lead virtual immobility social isolation . Our understand complex interface physiological impairment disability COPD increase considerably recent year . It become clear COPD , exercise intolerance ultimately reflect integrated abnormality ventilatory , cardiovascular , peripheral muscle neurosensory system . Ventilatory constraint dominant contributor exercise limitation advance disease . Recently , important study conduct role peripheral muscle dysfunction exercise limitation COPD . The present study test hypothesis administration bronchodilator ( i.e. , inhale β2-agonist inhaled anticholinergic combination ) normoxemic COPD patient moderate-intensity constant-load exercise may result enhancement oxidative metabolism , reflect reduction O2 def phase 2 tV'O2 . Fifteen normoxemic patient stable COPD ( FEV1 less 60 % predict ) severe chronic breathlessness ( Baseline Dyspnea Index less 6 ) complete study . Each patient perform three visit . At first visit , patient familiarize various questionnaire scale rating intensity quality symptom carry pulmonary function test symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise test order determine anaerobic threshold ( AT ) , peak work-rate peak oxygen uptake . Each patient subsequently complete two visit receive either nebulized bronchodilator ( BD ) ( Combivent® , ipratropium 0.5 mg + salbutamol 2.5 mg ) placebo ( PL ) , random order . At 90-100 minute post-dose , patient perform pulmonary function test , perform constant-load exercise test 80 % AT V'O2 . During constant-load exercise test ( 2nd 3rd visit ) , small sample blood earlobe subject collect order determine level lactate breathing gas ( oxygen carbon dioxide ) blood .</detailed_description>
