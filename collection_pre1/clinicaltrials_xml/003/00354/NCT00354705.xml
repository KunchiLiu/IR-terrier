	<brief_title>Prognostic Molecular Environmental Factors High-Risk Colon Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment drug ( chemotherapy ) frequent evaluation doctor standard practice help prevent colon cancer recur surgery . Despite measure , cancer recur significant number people , usually within first 2-3 year diagnosis . In study , researcher hope identify genetic environmental factor may contribute person develop recurrent colon cancer . To help identify factor , blood tissue sample study . You also ask provide information background , lifestyle , eat habit . Participants able take part study know colon cancer remove surgery agree receive chemotherapy help prevent cancer recur . Before take part study , medical information review , performance status evaluation ( well perform everyday activity ) do . This help doctor decide eligible take part study . If find eligible agree take part study , ask fill 2 questionnaire . One questionnaire ask background ( age , education , etc . ) , work history , exposure toxic substance , medical history , smoke alcohol history , family history cancer , level physical activity . The second questionnaire contains question type food eat , often eat , whether take vitamin , type ( ) . It take 30 minute fill questionnaire . If surgery remove colon cancer perform MD Anderson , ask participate tissue portion study describe asked participate blood sample analysis study evaluation questionnaire portion study every 3 month maximum 2 year ( start begin follow-up period , treatment complete ) disease return , ever occur first . If surgery perform MD Anderson Cancer Center , sample cancer tissue analyze , look biologic factor related colon cancer . Blood sample ( 4 teaspoon ) gene analysis ( look biologic factor associate colon cancer ) also collect . Once follow-up begin , study evaluation MD Anderson every 3 month 2 year disease return , ever occur first . Blood sample ( 4 teaspoon ) gene analysis collect within 14 day completion chemotherapy , every 3 month 2 year enroll study . If colon cancer recurs , blood sample take time also . You ask fill 2 questionnaire describe completion chemotherapy treatment ( applicable ) 1 2 year follow-up begin . If colon cancer recurs , ask fill questionnaire time . If require surgery cancer enrol study , sample leftover tissue collect genetic analysis surgery perform MD Anderson Cancer Center . You informed result analysis blood tumor sample questionnaire , research exploratory . Your participation study end disease return 2 year begin , whichever occur first . This investigational study . Taking part study require return frequently MD Anderson . Up 200 participant take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically proven adenocarcinoma colon . Those patient tissue available MDACC analysis eligible participate blood , questionnaire data portion study . They participate tissue portion study . 2 . AJCC stage II [ T34 ( subscript ) N0 ( subscript ) M0 ( subscript ) ] stage III [ TX ( subscript ) N13 ( subscript ) M0 ( subscript ) ] . 3 . Age &gt; = 14 yr old . 4 . If patient elect receive chemotherapy administer outside M. D. Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) , patient must agree complete subsequent surveillance M.D . Anderson Cancer Center participate clinical trial . 5 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent/authorization document . 1 . Patients initiated adjuvant chemotherapy prior participate study include . 2 . Patients known history familial adenomatous polyposis ( FAP ) , hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ( HNPCC ) , hereditary polyposis syndrome ( Muir Torre , Gardner 's Syndrome , etc ) exclude since patient increase risk second primary malignancy higher risk recurrent disease . 3 . No prior malignancy ( exclude nonmelanomatous skin neoplasm ) past 5 year . 4 . Patients know diagnosis HIV/AIDS Hepatitis C exclude study due increase risk second primary malignancy may complicate appropriate analysis DFS . 5 . Patients unable selfadminister protocol questionnaire exclude study .</criteria>
