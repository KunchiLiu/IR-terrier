	<brief_title>Imatinib Combination With Dacarbazine Capecitabine Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase I : Imatinib mesylate drug bind certain protein tumor cell , may prevent cell grow . Capecitabine dacarbazine drug interfere growth cancer cell . If find eligible take part study , begin treatment imatinib mesylate , capecitabine , dacarbazine . You come M. D. Anderson least every three week ( 21 day ) treatment . Each 21-day period treatment call `` cycle '' therapy . You receive least 3 cycle therapy ( 9 week ) unless side effect severe cancer grows quickly . The first group study participant receive low dos imatinib mesylate , capecitabine dacarbazine . If dos appear safe , next group participant receive high dos . This continue high dos may safely give found . You take imatinib mesylate capsule mouth day Days 1-21 cycle . Imatinib mesylate take meal large glass water . You take capecitabine tablet mouth twice day Days 1-14 cycle . You take dose capecitabine within 30 minute eat meal . It important take tablet together water fruit juice . Each dose capecitabine 12 hour apart ( example , breakfast evening meal ) . You small tube ( central venous line ) insert large vein skin chest vein arm receive dacarbazine . Dacarbazine give 1 hour Days 1-3 cycle . During first cycle therapy , blood ( 2 ½ teaspoon ) collect week routine test . Before new cycle therapy , complete physical exam urine blood ( 2 ½ teaspoon ) collect routine test . You ask tell study doctor medication take since start take study drug health problem may experience . You also either CT scan MRI tumor ( ) every 9 week end study . Additional test may do study doctor feel necessary care . All test new cycle treatment treatment stop must do M. D. Anderson . You always tell study doctor take medication , see another doctor , receive new treatment change way feeling since last visit . If see another doctor ( ) , inform doctor currently study . Have doctor contact study doctor discus necessary treatment . If experience severe side effect , treatment may delay , stop , may receive small dos drug . You may continue receive treatment study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If happens , take study doctor discus treatment option . When stop take part study , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) collect routine test . You physical exam either CT scan MRI check status disease . You contact phone every three month rest life check status disease symptom may experience . This investigational study . The drug dacarbazine , imatinib mesylate , capecitabine FDA approve commercially available treat certain form cancer . Up 24 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson . Phase II : Imatinib mesylate drug bind certain protein tumor cell , may prevent cell grow . Capecitabine dacarbazine drug interfere growth cancer cell . If find eligible take part study , begin treatment imatinib mesylate , capecitabine , dacarbazine . You come M. D. Anderson least every three week ( 21 day ) treatment .
