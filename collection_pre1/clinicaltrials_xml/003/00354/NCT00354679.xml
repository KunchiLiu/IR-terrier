	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some find tumor cell kill carry tumor-killing substance . Others interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab may also stop growth esophageal cancer block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy together radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving bevacizumab surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give irinotecan , cisplatin , bevacizumab together radiation therapy follow surgery bevacizumab work treat patient locally advanced esophageal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate toxicity safety bevacizumab give together cisplatin , irinotecan hydrochloride , radiotherapy follow surgery adjuvant bevacizumab patient locally advanced esophageal adenocarcinoma . Secondary - Observe rate pathologic complete response patient treat regimen . - Observe overall survival , disease-free survival , patterns failure patient . - Clarify toxicity tolerability regimen . - Evaluate pre-treatment level vascular endothelial growth factor patient serum corollary response regimen . - Correlate serum proteomics data complete pathologic response . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive cisplatin IV 30 minute irinotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 22 , 29 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 22 . - Combination therapy radiotherapy : Patients receive cisplatin irinotecan hydrochloride induction chemotherapy day 43 , 50 , 64 , 71 . Patients also receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 43 64 . Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy 5 day week 6 week begin day 43 . - Surgery : Patients undergo surgery 6-8 week finish combination therapy radiotherapy . - Maintenance therapy : Approximately 6 week surgery , patient receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute every 3 week 6 month . Blood sample obtain baseline , finish chemoradiotherapy , prior maintenance therapy examine matrix-assisted laser-desorption ionization time flight ( MALDI-TOF ) mass spectometry proteomic profiling . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
