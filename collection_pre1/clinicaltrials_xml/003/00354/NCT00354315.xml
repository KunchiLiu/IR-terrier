Feasibility base proportion contact group practice agree participate , proportion recruit physician participate workshop , level satisfaction workshop , proportion miss data survey . Secondary outcome include measure decision use antibiotic , decisional conflict , decisional regret , prescription profile antibiotic ARI , script concordance test , physician ' reaction uncertainty intention engage SDM use clinical practice guideline regard use antibiotic ARI future clinical encounters.. The investigator hypothesize share decision make translate optimize prescription physician lead optimize drug use patient . We believe project help enhance health Quebec citizen well drug use patient .</detailed_description>
