	<detailed_description>The purpose study test temperature homeostasis football player improve circulate cool , dry air underneath shoulder pad period intense physical activity . To assess efficacy intervention , several dependent variable test : core body temperature , skin temperature , infrared skin temperature , heart rate , sweat rate , urine color , urine specific gravity , physiological strain index , visual analog thirst , rate perceive exertion , thermal sensation scale , fluid intake . The two independent variable ( test variable ) treatment two level ( Control - air blown shoulder pad , COOL - cool , dry air blow shoulder pad ) time ( pre-exercise post-exercise cycle , rest break recovery ) . Specific Aim 1 : To assess difference physiological parameter cool dry air blown football shoulder pad mean cool football player period exercise exercise . Limited research available demonstrate efficacy cool method alternate vigorous exercise . Football player particular risk heat-related illness frequently practice compete hot , humid condition uniforms limit body 's natural thermoregulation . To study specific aim , three hypothesis address data collection process investigation : ( 1 ) significantly low increase core body temperature , heart rate , skin temperature , infrared skin temperature note COOL test session compare Control session ; ( 2 ) significantly low measurement urine color , urine specific gravity , sweat rate note COOL test session compare Control session ; ( 3 ) significant association note core body temperature infrared temperature test session . Specific Aim 2 : To assess difference subjective rating exertion heat stress exercise session cool dry air blown football shoulder pad compare air rest break exercise bout . The rationale behind Specific Aim 2 cool method ( COOL ) aid improve body 's blunted cooling mechanism . The sensation cool , dry air prominent sensation warmth ( COOL trial ) , decrease physiological strain , decrease core body temperature cause subject experience lower perceive exertion ; thus , subject ' subjective response exertion subsequent exercise cycle decrease . One hypothesis address related specific aim : cool , dry air blown football shoulder pad ( COOL ) cool method exercise bouts significantly low physiological strain index score , visual analog thirst score , rate perceive exertion , thermal sensation score compare cool , dry air blow shoulder pad ( Control ) .</detailed_description>
