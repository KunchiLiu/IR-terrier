	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate safety reactogenicity two dose level WRAIR 's AMA1 malaria antigen ( FMP2.1 ) adjuvanted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals ' AS02A compare rabies vaccine malaria-experienced Malian adult age 18-55 year inclusive . Secondary objective : ( 1 ) measure magnitude duration antibody response FMP2.1 ; ( 2 ) measure cellular immune response FMP2.1 baseline immunization ; ( 3 ) measure inhibition parasite growth vitro GIA ; ( 4 ) determine specificity antibody diverse AMA1 genotype addition 3D7 , measure ELISA , GIA parasites type AMA1 . A double-blind control dose escalation trial allow assessment vaccine safety three group , one group receive medium full dose level experimental vaccine , one group receive comparator vaccine . Thirty adult randomize receive medium dose level FMP2.1 ( n=20 ) rabies vaccine ( n=10 ) thirty receive full dose level FMP2.1 ( n=20 ) rabies vaccine ( n=10 ) . The division rabies group two group ten do maintain blind immunization time point , participant receive rabies vaccine analyze single group . The sample size group , however , allow detection anything large difference occurrence adverse event among three group . The advantage double blind remove potential investigator participant prejudgment effect vaccine report adverse event .</detailed_description>
