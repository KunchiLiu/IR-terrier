	<detailed_description>Soil-transmitted helminth ( STH ) infections public health importance widespread large part world , particularly poor section population reside least developed country . The infection control several measure , currently deliver anthelminthic drug school health centre believe effective take advantage exist infrastructure . In Zambia , anthelminthic drug deliver child age 12 59 month twice year health facility child health promotion week . However , observe treatment coverage low certain area . Therefore , need identify factor associate treatment coverage pattern , provide evidence effective intervention approach could increase proportion child receive treatment . The WHO Special Programme Research Training Tropical Diseases ( TDR ) develop Community-Directed Treatment ( COMDT ) approach , adopt control onchocerciasis lymphatic filariasis . WHO recommend use COMDT approach control schistosomiasis STH infection . The COMDT approach compare school base programme certain African country , never use Zambia never compare health-facility base approach control infection child school age . It background project propose . The project implement Mazabuka district Zambia . Two Rural Health Centres ( RHCs ) select district map treatment coverage health-facility base approach . Focus group discussion ( FGDs ) in-depth interview conduct community member explore reason exist treatment coverage health facility approach . The COMDT approach implement catchment area one RHCs supplement health-facility-based approach . After round treatment , coverage factor influence coverage measure area . The health impact health facility base approach without COMDT approach compare . Parameters health impact child growth , prevalence intensity STH infection number illness episode require treatment . The effect COMDT control approach STH infection monitor infection community child age 12 59 month , appropriateness approach evaluate use African Programme Onchocerciasis Control grade system . The whole project expect take 3 year .</detailed_description>
