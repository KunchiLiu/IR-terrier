Vibrio cholerae ( V cholerae ) important infectious cause severe secretory diarrhea human . The purpose study assess duration immune response group 250 individual , age 2-60 year , present International Centre Diarrheal Diseases Research , Bangladesh ( ICDDR , B ) hospital admit acute cholera . Fifty participant enrol substudy mucosal immunity involve duodenal biopsy . This protocol focus exclusively subset 50 study participant ( healthy 18-45 year old non pregnant subject ) enrol substudy mucosal immunity involve duodenal biopsy . This study link DMID protocol 06-0045 . The remainder study observational , involve collection stool , vomit , blood sample ( DMID protocol 06-0045 ) . A duodenal biopsy perform enrollment next day Day 30 . Twenty five subject undergo third duodenal biopsy 6 month follow-up 25 subject undergo third duodenal biopsy 12 month follow-up . The objective study follow : measure immune response direct Vibrio cholerae antigen evaluate development anti-V cholerae memory B cell study participant cholera ; assess duration immune response follow episode cholera ; correlate duration antigen-specific , antibody-secreting cell various cholera antigens duodenal tissue measurement duration immunity base antibody response serum , well circulate antigen-specific memory B cell .
