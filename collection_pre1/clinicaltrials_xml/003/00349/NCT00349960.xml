	<detailed_description>Current European Best Practice Guidelines KDOQI Committee USA recommend preferential subcutaneous ( SC ) twice- thrice-weekly epoetin administration . SC route significantly reduce epoetin requirement therefore cost , compare intravenous ( IV ) route . Additionally , solid evidence show once-weekly SC administration epoetin beta equally efficient well tolerate hemodialyzed ( HD ) patient . Clinical study suggest effect epoetin alpha sustain one week , enable less frequent schedule pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) patient . A recent European multicenter study peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient confirm once-every-two-weeks SC epoetin beta efficient safe maintenance phase anemia treatment PD patients11 . Thus , optimum epoetin dose regimen still yet determine despite decade clinical use . All data also suggest pharmacodynamic effect epoetins could last long plasma half-lives . The survival half-life erythrocyte produce exogenous epoetin administration longer erythrocytes produce absence exogenous stimulation . Apart academic interest , issue also direct implication cost saving increase patient ’ convenience . Furthermore , less frequent administration would reduce epidemiological hazard associate population high risk blood-borne viral infection hepatitis , particularly important less developed country , high prevalence viral hepatitis infection ( hepatitis B/C marker prevalence : 15.7 % /45 % Romania versus 3 % /13.5 % EuroDOPPS patient ) . While potential benefit less frequent dose clear , efficacy safety regimen must fully investigate adoption standard treatment . The present study investigates first time equivalence once-weekly versus once-every-two-weeks SC epoetin beta dose regimen , maintenance phase anemia therapy , stable HD patient . The aim study ass whether once-every-other-week SC administration total epoetin beta dose effective safe SC once-weekly dosing . In order avoid carry-over effect weekly schedule epoetin treatment receive prior randomization , define run-in period ( week 1-12 ) . Statistical analysis perform efficacy parameter determine assessment period . The average week 13-24 obtain add value divide sum number time point patient period . The two treatment schedule consider equivalent primary efficacy parameter simultaneously similar group predefined range variation . Confidence interval ( CIs ) use compare group . Since target Hb dialyze patient define 11g/dL ( 110 g/L ) European Guidelines &gt; 10 g/dL ( 100 g/L ) National Guidelines , recommend upper limit 13 g/dL ( 130 g/L ) , efficacy range Hb study predefined 10-12 g/dL ( 100-120 g/L ) . The two treatment schedule consider similar efficacy mean Hb Group 2w differ ±0.5 g/dL ( ±5 g/L ) compare Group 1w assessment period . Once similar efficacy establish , drug requirement compare calculate ratio mean weekly epoetin dos Group 2w/Group 1w . A range 0.8 1.25 ratio consider sufficient define bioequivalence . Equivalence drug usage two arm accept whole 95 % CI ratio within limit . Lack difference group mean imply similar distribution treatment effect within group . The individual hemoglobin change use assess response treatment similarly variable two arm . The change Hb calculate patient difference mean Hb assessment period mean Hb baseline phase . The percentage patient target Hb require increase epoetin dose assessment period compare chi-squared statistic . The study design detect difference Hb study group least 0.5 g/dL ( 5 g/L ) , probability 95 % power 0.9021 , assume standard deviation Hb HD population 1.0 g/dL ( 10 g/L ) . A sample size 85 patient require arm trial . Since study design include epoetin dos variation order maintain target hemoglobin , would expect Hb would constant epoetin dose would vary . Therefore , power calculation use epoetin dos outcome measure seem appropriate . Considering standard deviation 39 IU/kg per week , probability 95 % power 90 % , sample size 70 patient arm require detect ± 20 % difference epoetin dose group . Because anticipated drop-out proportion 15 % , minimum 100 patient enrol group satisfy Hb epoetin dose power condition .</detailed_description>
