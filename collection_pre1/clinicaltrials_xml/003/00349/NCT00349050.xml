	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) Effects Pain Perception</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain represent huge public health concern generally poorly understood basic neurobiological level . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) non-invasive technique use electromagnetic pulse temporarily stimulate specific brain area awake people ( without need surgery , anesthesia , invasive procedure ) . Previous research suggest TMS may effective reduce pain perception healthy adult patient various type pain condition , neuropathic pain . However , relatively little research TMS pain address optimal TMS device parameter , optimal cortical target , potential difference response TMS healthy person chronic pain . The purpose trial study effect TMS pain perception . Specifically , study determine optimal device parameter ( dose ) brain target stimulation TMS order reduce pain patient neuropathic pain healthy adult use laboratory pain method . Participants Neuropathic Pain : After initial screening , eligible participant neuropathic pain receive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan help determine best target TMS stimulation later study . Participants ask record pain experience every day 2-4 week receive first 2 laboratory pain assessment . The laboratory pain assessment use small device , control computer attach underside forearm , produce different temperature stimulation . As device reach level consider painful participant , he/she push button return level comfort . The next part trial involve two , 20-minute TMS treatment session per day 5-days . Participants randomly assign one two group . Group A receive real TMS Group B receive `` sham '' TMS . Study participation time individual TGN 8 week , include 10 hour ( 7 visit ) Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) . Healthy Volunteers : In addition interview researcher regard medical history , healthy participant complete self-report screening ass pain history level depression anxiety . Eligible participant give laboratory pain assessment , randomly assign one two group : group A receive real TMS group B receive `` sham '' TMS . After TMS , participant receive another full laboratory pain assessment complete questionnaire . For healthy volunteer , participation study take 3 hour may complete one two visit .</detailed_description>
