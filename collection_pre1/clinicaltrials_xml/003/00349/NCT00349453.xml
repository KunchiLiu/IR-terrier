	<brief_title>Study Using Deferiprone Alone Combination With Desferrioxamine Iron Overloaded Transfusion-dependent Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients refractory anemias require regular blood transfusion accumulate iron rate approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day , may lead serious organ toxicity , e.g . heart , liver endocrine organ . The human body active mechanism excretion excess iron . Therefore multiply transfuse patient develop secondary hemosiderosis , excess iron excrete chelate agent . Symptoms iron-overload occur body iron store reach 10-20 g. At high level severe , even fatal complication , particularly cardiac failure , may develop . Desferrioxamine ( DFO , Desferal ) establish commonly use iron-chelating drug , expensive must give slow subcutaneous intravenous infusion 8-12 hour day 5-7 day weekly dosage 40-50 mg/kg body weight/day . This often lead failure compliance patient therefore inefficient iron chelation . Further , patient hypersensitive desferrioxamine others suffer toxicity , e.g . ear eyes . Deferiprone ( L1 ; CP20 ; 1,2 dimethyl-3-hydroxypyrid-4-one ) orally active iron chelator investigate various clinical trial since 1987 . Dosages 75 - 100 mg/kg body weight/day L1 consider effective maintain stable iron balance ( urinary iron excretion 0.5 mg/kg/day ) reduce serum ferritin level 6 % 25 % within one year treatment iron-overloaded thalassemic patient . There exist long-term experience patient receive deferiprone continuously 10 year far . The main side effect encounter deferiprone therapy arthropathy , gastrointestinal symptom , headache , mild zinc deficiency . These adverse reaction usually reverse reduce dose discontinue drug . Except severe joint symptom patient , subject different clinical trial able continue L1 therapy long term . The severe , rare complication follow administration deferiprone agranulocytosis neutropenia . A new treatment regimen combine deferiprone desferrioxamine currently investigate many country . Preliminary data demonstrate combined use drug highly active show additive even synergistic effect ( significant decrease serum ferritin hepatic iron content , increase urinary iron excretion ) . This synergism could explain different mode action two drug . It could demonstrate patient sufficiently chelate desferrioxamine deferiprone , could achieve negative iron balance combination treatment drug . The combined regimen generally well tolerate . It speculate individual toxicity profile drug positively influence simultaneous administration L1 DFO . The daily treatment L1 tablet combine least twice week administration parenteral desferrioxamine patient-convenient therefore may enhance patient 's compliance . The primary aim study systematically investigate long-term safety ( toxicity assessment accord CTCAE v3.0 ) deferiprone either give alone combination desferrioxamine . Further , patient agree perform annual SQUID analysis liver , annual change liver iron concentration ( LIC ) examine four year .</detailed_description>
