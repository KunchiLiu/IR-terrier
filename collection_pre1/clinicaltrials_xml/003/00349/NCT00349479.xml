	<detailed_description>Stroke major public health problem . Only 1 3 percent people stroke patient community setting receive tissue plasminogen activator ( t-PA ) therapy ten year approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .

This multi-center , randomize , control study conduct 24 hospital site nationwide . The intervention , BA-IEI , target emergency department base adult education behavior change theory . BA-IEI designed replication community health initiative . It incorporate local stroke champion development , hospital-specific barrier evaluation , mixed CME target identified barrier , performance feedback , protocol development , academic detailing . The primary endpoint increase appropriate use t-PA stroke evaluation change emergency physician knowledge t-PA use . The primary aim study determine BA-IEI effective increase appropriate t-PA use stroke , BA-IEI improve emergency physician knowledge , belief , attitude regard use t-PA acute stroke . Results study may lead effective method increase use t-PA stroke .</detailed_description>
