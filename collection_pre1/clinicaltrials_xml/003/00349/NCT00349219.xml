	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare first-line erlotinib follow progression second-line chemotherapy vs. first-line chemotherapy follow progression second-line erlotinib treatment Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TORCH : A Study Tarceva Chemotherapy Treatment Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy patient affect advanced NSCLC demonstrate modest improvement survival rate best supportive care : prognosis patient remain poor side effect considerable . Therefore , novel agent urgently need disease . One way improve effectiveness therapy use non-chemotherapeutic agent act biological target cause few systemic side effect . Erlotinib ( Tarceva ) biological therapy recent clinical trial show promise first- second-line treatment advance NSCLC . In trial , patient randomize one two treatment strategy : - erlotinib take mouth daily ; , disease progression occur , follow chemotherapy cisplatin gemcitabine standard dose 6 cycle OR - chemotherapy cisplatin gemcitabine give intravenously standard dos 6 cycle ; disease progression occur follow erlotinib take mouth daily The study conduct partial support Roche , S.p.A .</detailed_description>

Prior chemotherapy therapy systemic antineoplastic therapy ( e.g. , monoclonal antibody therapy ) advance disease . Prior surgery and/or localise irradiation permit . Prior neoadjuvant chemotherapy operable disease adjuvant chemotherapy permit contain gemcitabine least 1 year elapse end chemotherapy date relapse . Any unstable systemic disease ( include active infection , significant cardiovascular disease myocardial infarction within previous year , significant hepatic , renal metabolic disease ) , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find contraindicates use study medication render patient high risk treatment complication . Any malignancy within past 5 year ( except adequately treat carcinoma situ cervix basal squamous cell skin cancer surgically resect prostate cancer normal PSA ) . Patients exclude brain metastasis spinal cord compression yet definitively treat surgery and/or radiation ; previously diagnose treat CNS metastases spinal cord compression without evidence stable disease ( clinically stable image ) least 2 month also cause patient exclude . Patients asymptomatic CNS metastasis require steroid control symptom include , even antiseizure medication . HIV positive patient Any inflammatory change surface eye baseline Patients take oral medication , require intravenous alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease .
