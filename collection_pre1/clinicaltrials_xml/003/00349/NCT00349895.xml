	<brief_summary>This multi-center , prospective , non-randomized study . Approximately 90 patient 16 center enter study . Patients follow clinically 5 year post-procedure . All patient repeat angiography 6 month follow-up . The primary objective study evaluate safety effectiveness Genous Bio-engineered R stentTM conjunction optimal statin therapy ( 80mg atorvastatin ) , treatment elective patient two de novo native coronary artery lesion . The Genous stent receive CE mark intend indication August 2005</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Healthy Endothelial Accelerated Lining Inhibits Neointimal Growth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently available coronary stent prone thrombosis restenosis . It believe accelerated re-establishment functional endothelial layer damage stented vascular segment may help prevent potentially serious complication provide barrier circulate cytokine , ability endothelial cell produce substance passivate underlie smooth muscle cell layer . By recruit patient 's EPCs site vascular injury ( e.g . site coronary stent implant ) , acceleration normal endothelialization process would occur . It theorize rapid establishment function endothelial layer may promote transformation injure site healthy state . For example , case coronary stent implantation , rapid re-endothelialization may reduce inflammation , thrombosis potentially eliminate restenosis . The influence EPC recruitment reendothelialization restenosis range effect vascular repair response , prevention platelet aggregation activation , angiogenesis , enhancement vasomotor response . Recently show integrity functional activity endothelial monolayer play crucial role prevention atherosclerosis . However , risk factor coronary artery disease age , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes reduce number functional activity circulate EPCs , thus limit regenerative capacity . The impairment stem cell risk factor CAD patient may contribute limited regenerative capacity diseased endothelium , well atherogenesis atherosclerotic disease progression . Therefore , relate number function circulate EPCs functional outcome stent technology crucial identify beneficial effect in-stent restenosis formation vascular ( dy ) function . The HEALING FIM HEALING II clinical study seek define safety efficacy stent design sequester circulate endothelial progenitor cell luminal surface stent strut anti-CD34 antibody coating , thereby promote reendothelialization coronary stent vascular heal response follow stent deployment . Enhanced vascular heal reinstate vascular integrity , prevent platelet aggregation sub-acute in-stent thrombosis , reinstate vasoreactivity inhibit restenosis formation . In HEALING II study , correlation find EPC level angiographic/IVUS outcomes patient receive Genous stent . Patients normal EPC titer significantly less in-stent late loss compare low EPCs ( 0.53 vs 1.02mm ) . This consistent result drug elute stent trial , thereby establish proof concept EPC capture technology , provide adequate EPC target cell population available . There several animal study demonstrate statin therapy associate 2.5 3 fold increase circulate EPCs lead accelerated reendothelialization , vascular repair improved angiogenesis . In addition , Dimmeler co-worker find similar result small cohort cardiovascular patient receive atorvastatin therapy ( n=7 , Circulation 2001 ) , suggest angiotrophic effect atorvastatin therapy addition previously define pleiotrophic property . Similarly , Drexler co-worker describe similar EPC recruiting property simvastatin CAD patient unrelated to/ irrespective LDL reduction ( n=10 , Circulation 2005 ) . The current study seek confirm safety optimize effectiveness EPC capture technology ( Genous Bio-engineered R stent ) incorporate high dose statin therapy , specifically atorvastatin 80mg , least two week prior index procedure .</detailed_description>
