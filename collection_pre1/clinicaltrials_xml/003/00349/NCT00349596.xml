	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find safety decitabine patient acute lymphocytic leukemia . Upon agreement patient , additional blood bone marrow sample use evaluate effect treatment leukemic cell . Also , agreement patient , leftover blood bone marrow sample collect start study regularly schedule evaluation send research study . The research study examine change blood bone marrow cell might help explain cause leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Low-Dose Decitabine Relapsed Refractory Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Decitabine potent hypomethylating agent clinical activity myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , acute chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) . In vitro , decitabine induces loss cell viability apoptosis ALL derive cell line know DNA methylation alteration . Exposure cell line decitabine result hypomethylation reactivation putative tumor suppressor gene , effect think role antineoplastic activity decitabine . Aberrant DNA methylation multiple promoter CpG islands frequently observe patient ALL initial presentation time relapse . Indeed methylation mark stable 70 % patient ALL time relapse . Importantly , methylation specific molecular pathway associate extremely poor prognosis patient ALL . For instance , data laboratory identify methylation , silence , cell cycle pathway compose p73 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p57KIP2 p15 , marker poor prognosis patient Philadelphia chromosome ( Ph ) negative disease . These result corroborate protein level : expression p57KIP2 p15/p73 associate well prognosis . Finally , although global methylation pattern observe child ALL , overall excellent prognosis , seem differ old patient genetic characteristic , methylation prognostically significant pathway , P73/P15/P57KIP2 remarkably low young patient . Finally , introduction p57KIP2 methylated/silenced ALL cell line result cell cycle arrest induction apoptosis . All data indicate aberrant methylation role clinical behavior patient ALL reversal may result clinical benefit .</detailed_description>
