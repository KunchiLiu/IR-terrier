	<brief_summary>An abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) weaken enlarged area abdominal aorta , large blood vessel abdomen . If AAA rupture , life-threatening . Research show sedentary individual increase risk develop AAAs . This study evaluate effectiveness exercise program limiting growth small AAAs old individual .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AAAs common among old individual , 10th lead cause death men age 55 . A ruptured AAA usually lead death . Therefore , early detection treatment critical . Currently , several surgical treatment option available , proven non-surgical treatment AAAs . Research show physical inactivity may link development AAAs . The purpose study gather information AAA risk factor , evaluate effectiveness exercise program preventing growth small AAAs old individual . This study compose three individual project . Project 1 enroll 1400 individual small AAAs . Project 2 enroll 1000 individual unknown aortic size previously test exercise capacity . Both group participant attend one study visit , time medical history physical activity history record , vital sign collect , blood urine sample give . Questionnaires complete document physical activity level AAA risk factor . An abdominal ultrasound perform measure size aorta AAA . Participants Project 2 also take part treadmill exercise test , heart rate blood pressure record , heart activity monitor electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . The third project last 3 year enroll 340 individual Project 1 . Participants randomly assign either exercise program usual activity group . An initial screening visit include medical history review , vital sign measurement , blood collection , questionnaire , abdominal ultrasound , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Participants exercise program complete exercise test beginning study every 6 month duration study . Participants live within 15 mile Palo Alto VA Hospital take part supervise aerobic exercise program 3 day week . Participants live far 15 mile hospital receive detailed exercise plan exercise wear heart rate activity track device . They also attend monthly study visit review progress . All participant assign exercise program encourage increase daily exercise . Each day wear pedometer ; twice month wear global positioning system ( GPS ) heart rate monitor . Participants assign usual activity group wear pedometer day maintain usual level physical activity . At yearly study visit , blood collect physical activity level assess . All Project 3 participant AAAs small 4 cm undergo ultrasound blood collection year ; participant AAAs 4 cm large undergo procedure every 6 month . At end 3 year , participant attend final study visit time medical history review blood collect . They also undergo abdominal ultrasound , PET , CT , MRI scan .</detailed_description>
