	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine acute late toxicity radiation therapy combination bevacizumab ( give every 2 week 16 week every 3 week 12 week ) , bicalutamide ( every day 16 week ) goserelin ( every 3 month 2 year ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab With Hormonal Radiotherapy High-Risk Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although data toxicity concurrent bevacizumab hormonal therapy , combination expect increase toxicity see give single agent . Abnormal tumor microenvironments , tumor progression , metastatic spread major factor contribute treatment failure radiotherapy . Anti-VEGF agent ( e.g . bevacizumab ) help overcome factor several different mechanisims . Studies also demonstrate prolong use anti-VEGF agent radiation therapy effective preventing metastasis irradiate tumor compare short course . Patients generally start hormonal therapy daily radiotherapy time . This study delay start radiotherapy 8 week start hormonal therapy bevacizumab .</detailed_description>
