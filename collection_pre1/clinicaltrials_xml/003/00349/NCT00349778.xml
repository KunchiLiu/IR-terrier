	<brief_title>High -Dose Sequential Therapy Single Autologous Transplantation Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We perform 200 autologous HCT myeloma Stanford use high-dose sequential therapy BCNU dose 550 mg/m2 plus melphalan 200 mg/m2 . Analysis 196 patient treated way demonstrate median event-free survival 36 month median overall survival six year . The main toxicity therapy relate BCNU-pneumonitis interstitial pneumonitis ( IP ) . This complication relate dose BCNU well describe literature ( 18 ) . In myeloma patient treat dose BCNU incidence IP 34 % . There recent study evaluate role tandem autologous transplant patient multiple myeloma . These trial base upon hypothesis perform tandem high-dose therapy regimen would lead increased tumor cell kill , decreased tumor burden improvement overall survival ( 9 , 19 ) . There trial compare single double transplant suggest may benefit tandem autologous transplant event-free survival overall survival ( 20-22 ) . However , result high-dose sequential therapy include dose-intense BCNU/Melphalan transplant demonstrate similar median event-free survival overall survival compare result tandem transplant approach . The propose trial continue use high-dose sequential transplant approach , however , use reduce dose BCNU expect associate low incidence IP .</detailed_description>
