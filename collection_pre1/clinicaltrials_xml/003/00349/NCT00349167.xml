	<brief_title>PR-104 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate safety tolerability PR-104 patient advance solid tumor . - Determine maximum tolerate dose PR-104 patient . Secondary - Characterize pharmacokinetics PR-104 alcohol metabolite patient . - Assess evidence antitumor activity drug patient . Tertiary - Examine metabolic change tumor patient use fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography scan . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label , prospective , uncontrolled , dose-escalation study . Patients receive PR-104 IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos PR-104 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Blood collect baseline periodically study treatment pharmacokinetic tumor marker study . Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography scan begin study treatment completion course 2 assess metabolic activity tumor . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
