	<brief_title>Treatment Patients With Age-Related Macular Degeneration With Anecortave Acetate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) , complication age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , common cause profound visual loss United States . Laser photocoagulation show retard visual loss , however 20 % patient CNV eligible laser treatment . Conventional laser photocoagulation CNV require laser intensity adequate coagulate protein target tissue . Due proximity CNV center vision ( fovea ) , intensity laser irradiation necessary , heat conduction ocular tissue , collateral tissue damage often result compromise vision . Recently , new class compound ( angiostatic steroid ) find inhibit formation new blood vessel ( i.e . neovascularization ) eye . One new angiostatic steroid , anecortave acetate ( AL-3789 ) , may represent breakthrough therapy ocular neovascular disease AMD diabetic retinopathy . Anecortave acetate suppresses formation new blood vessel variety model neovascularization . Unlike angiostatic steroid , anecortave acetate appear lack pharmacological activity typical steroid family ( i.e . glucocorticoid , anti-inflammatory , cardiovascular , neurologic , diuretic , etc . ) Additionally , anecortave acetate show arrest lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGH ) induce corneal neovascularization , attenuate oxygen-induced retinopathy inhibit growth highly vascularize intraocular tumor . The purpose study treat small number patient would normally qualify anecortave acetate study . These patient eligible anecortave acetate study treatment option likely experience poor visual outcome result AMD . These patient exclude study `` occult '' neovascularization visual acuity bad 20/40 . Sub-Tenon 's injection either 15 mg 30 mg anecortave acetate administer University Iowa . The patient follow minimum 24 month .</detailed_description>
