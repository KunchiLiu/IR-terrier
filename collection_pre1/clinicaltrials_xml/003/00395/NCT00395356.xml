	<brief_summary>The goal study measure effect approach include phase active weight loss break weight stabilisation period ( name intermittent weight loss ) metabolic profile . First , intermittent weight loss approach contribute create artificial transitory steady state weight loss treatment help minimize adverse effect standard approach muscle mass rest metabolic rate . Second , despite comparable fat mass loss , intermittent weight loss approach improve metabolic profile great degree compare standard approach . Finally , intermittent weight loss approach associate less weight regain treatment since beneficial effect muscle mass metabolic rate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Excessive level body fat associate metabolic disturbance predictive increase risk coronary heart disease ( CAD ) . It presently unclear magnitude weight loss need accrue metabolic benefit . Despite effectiveness weight loss reduce obesity level , study show minor decrease body weight ( 5-10 % ) need clinically improve CAD risk factor . Our data suggest 10 % reduction body weight effective improve metabolic profile 20 % decrease body weight . Thus , question : “ Is possible improve metabolic profile 5-10 % weight loss threshold ? ” “ Could several 5-10 % body weight loss ( intermittent weight loss approach ) additive effect metabolic profile ? ” . We would like follow-up observation well understand 1 ) association weight loss improvement metabolic profile 2 ) minor decrease body composition body fat distribution effective important reduction .</detailed_description>
