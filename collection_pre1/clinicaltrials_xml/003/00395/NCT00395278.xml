	<brief_summary>Dr. Burbelo colleague develop technique rapidly quantitatively detect antibody response sera variety pathogen use recombinant protein . We would like apply technique develop assay detect antibody HHV-8 ( KSHV , etiologic agent Kaposi 's sarcoma , AIDS-defining condition ) . We initially plan examine sample patient Kaposi 's sarcoma , since patient almost certainly infected HHV-8 . We thus use sample patient previously diagnose Kaposi 's sarcoma . The sample question store NCI FCRF repository operate SAIC Frederick Rockville , MD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our colleague develop technique rapidly quantitatively detect antibody response sera variety antigen use recombinant protein . We would like apply technique develop assay detect antibody HHV- 8 ( KSHV , etiologic agent Kaposi sarcoma , AIDS-defining condition ) . In addition would like potentially measure antibody responses HIV , infectious agent , human antigen , see antibody ( high antibody titer ) antigen associate Kaposi sarcoma HIV infection . We initially plan examine sample patient Kaposi sarcoma , since patient almost certainly infected HHV-8 . We would subsequently plan examine sample HIV positive HIV negative patient without know Kaposi sarcoma . We thus request permission use sample patient without previously diagnose Kaposi 's Sarcoma . In addition antibody testing , would also like examine sample evidence infection infectious agent , newly identify unknown virus , use technique PCR deep sequencing .</detailed_description>
