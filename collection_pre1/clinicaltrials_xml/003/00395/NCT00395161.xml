	<detailed_description>Despite strict hand washing , sterile technique , antibiotic-coated catheter , nosocomial infection sepsis remain leading acquired cause morbidity mortality critically ill child . Subsequent use antibiotic treat nosocomial infection sepsis consider major attributable factor rise antibiotic-resistant organism population child . Presently , `` prophylaxis '' strategy use prevent stress-induced gastrointestinal bleeding ; however , `` prophylaxis '' strategy use prevent stress-induced nosocomial infection sepsis . When left unopposed , stress hormone , cortisol , induces lymphocyte apoptosis , lymphopenia , immune insufficiency . Prolactin counter-regulatory stress hormone prevent cortisol-induced apoptosis immunosuppression . Zinc , selenium , glutamine also important maintenance lymphocyte health . Critically ill patient commonly develop hypoprolactinemia secondary increase central nervous system dopaminergic activity , well zinc , selenium , glutamine deficiency cause increased utilization decrease supply . Hypoprolactinemia prevent metoclopramide , dopamine 2 receptor antagonist commonly use prokinetic child , zinc , selenium , glutamine deficiency prevent enteral supplementation . This study use double-blind randomized control trial design test hypothesis daily prophylaxis metoclopramide , zinc , selenium glutamine reduce nosocomial infection sepsis critically ill child .</detailed_description>
