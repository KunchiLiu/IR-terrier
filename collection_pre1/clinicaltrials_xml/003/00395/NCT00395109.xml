	<brief_title>PET/CT Image Hypoxia Head Neck Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients head neck cancer great 3 cm image PET scan CT scan order determine area tumour hypoxic . Following surgical removal , sample tumour evaluate expression hypoxia gene . The preoperative imaging compare `` gold standard '' measure hypoxic response level gene transcription new hypoxia marker hypoxyprobe detection system ( pimonidazole ) . Hypothesis : FDG/PET visualization glycolysis combine CT visualization blood flow correlate cellular response hypoxic stress head neck tumor intra-tumor region . Measurement relative level mRNAs encode hypoxia response gene perform cell microdissected surgical sample . Good correlation image signal direct molecular measure hypoxic response primary human tumor provide information necessary develop treatment strategy employ target , increased radiation hypoxic tumor . Pimonidazole exogenous nitro-imidazole marker , detect immunohistochemical analysis frozen section . It detect cellular hypoxia upon become reduce cell low oxygen tension , property detect antibody mediate detection reduce form . It also show reliably specifically stain hypoxic region within tumor , correlate well patient prognosis treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
