	<brief_title>The Safety Immunogenicity TB Vaccine ; MVA85A , Healthy Volunteers Who Are Infected With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The need new vaccine tuberculosis Tuberculosis ( TB ) kill three million people annually . It estimate one third world 's population latently infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( M.tb ) ( Dye , 1999 ) . These latently infect individual risk reactivation infection , become immunosuppressed . Worldwide , coinfection HIV commonest cause immunosuppression increase chance reactivation 10 % lifetime risk 10 % annual risk ( Corbett , 1996 ) . The currently available vaccine , M. bovis BCG , largely ineffective protect adult pulmonary disease endemic area widely agree new effective tuberculosis vaccine major global public health priority ( Colditz , 1994 ) . However , may unethical impractical test deploy vaccine strategy include BCG , BCG confer worthwhile protection TB meningitis leprosy . An immunisation strategy include BCG also attractive population vaccine candidate need test already immunise BCG . Given high prevalence infection M.tb , vaccine could administer latently infect individual eradicate latent infection would enormous impact mortality morbidity TB . M.tb intracellular organism . CD4+ Th1-type cellular response essential protection increase evidence animal human study CD8+ T cell also play protective role ( Flynn , 2001 ) . However , generally difficult induce strong cellular immune response human use subunit vaccine . DNA vaccine , recombinant viral vector protein/adjuvant combination induce CD4+ CD8+ T cell , however none antigen delivery system induce high level antigen specific T cell , use alone . Heterologous prime-boost immunisation strategy involve give two different vaccine , encode antigen , several week apart . Using DNA prime-recombinant modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) boost induces high level antigen specific CD4+ CD8+ T cell use homologous boost vector number different disease model ( Schneider , 1998 ; McShane , 2001 ) . Given protective efficacy BCG childhood , ideally BCG would prim immunisation prime-boost strategy . In order , focus antigen 85A candidate antigen . Antigen 85A highly conserve amongst mycobacterial specie present strain BCG . Antigen 85A major secrete antigen M. tuberculosis form part antigen 85 complex ( A , B C ) . This complex constitute major portion secrete protein M.tb BCG . It involve fibronectin binding within cell wall mycolyltransferase activity . Antigen 85A immunodominant murine human study protective small animal ( Huygen , 1996 ) . Recombinant modify vaccinia virus Ankara ( rMVA ) . Many virus investigate potential recombinant vaccine . The successful worldwide eradication smallpox via vaccination live vaccinia virus highlight vaccinia candidate recombinant use . The recognition recent year non- replicate strain poxvirus MVA avipox vector immunogenic traditional replicating vaccinia strain enhance attractiveness approach . MVA ( modify vaccinia virus Ankara ) strain vaccinia virus passaged 570 time though avian cell , replication incompetent human cell line good safety record . It administer 120,000 vaccinee part smallpox eradication programme , adverse effect , despite deliberate vaccination high risk group ( Stickl , 1974 ; Mahnel , 1994 ) . This safety man consistent avirulence MVA animal model . MVA six major genomic deletion compare parental genome severely compromise ability replicate mammalian cell ( Meher , 1991 ) . No replication document non- transformed mammalian cell . Viral replication block late infection cell importantly viral recombinant protein synthesis unimpaired even abortive infection . The viral genome proven stable large series passage chicken embryo fibroblast . Replication-deficient recombinant MVA see exceptionally safe viral vector . When test animal model study recombinant MVAs show avirulent , yet protectively immunogenic vaccine viral disease cancer . Recent study severely immuno-suppressed macaque support view MVA safe immuno-compromised human ( Akira , 2001 ; Stittelaar , 2001 ) . There safety data number recombinant MVAs currently Phase I/II trial UK Africa . Useful data safety efficacy various dos recombinant MVA vaccine come clinical trial data recombinant MVA express number CTL epitopes Plasmodium falciparum pre-erythrocytic antigen fuse complete pre-erythrocytic stage antigen , Thrombospondin Related Adhesion Protein ( TRAP ) . To date MVA ME-TRAP administer 600 healthy volunteer ( adult child ) Oxford Africa ( The Gambia Kenya ) without serious adverse event ( Adrian Hill , unpublished , personal communication ) . Volunteers receive one three dose 3 15 x 107 pfu per dose intra-dermal vaccine three-week interval . All subject temporary local redness typically 5mm central red area paler pink surround area range size 1 -7cm diameter peak 48 hour post vaccination . At seven day post vaccination generally central red area remain . This fade next week usually apparent 2 month vaccination . The emerge safety profile recombinant MVA vaccine excellent support data clinical study three MVA recombinant make Oxford currently clinical study use MVAs HIV , HBV melanoma . To date vaccine administer 600 people serious adverse event ( Hill ; personal communication ) 40 HIV positive individual treat highly active anti-retroviral therapy ( HAART ) vaccinate least 5 x 107 PFU MVA contain HIV antigens serious adverse event ( Dorrell , unpublished data ; Cosma et al 2003 ; Harrer et al , 2005 ) . 7 HIV positive individual vaccinate MVA contain malaria antigens serious adverse event significant sustain rise viral load ( Bejon al , CID 2006 , press ) . Recombinant MVA encode antigen 85A MVA85A induces CD4+ CD8+ epitope use immunise mouse . When mouse prim BCG give MVA85A boost , level CD4+ CD8+ T cell induce high either BCG MVA85A alone , regime protective either vaccine alone ( Goonetilleke et al , 2003 ) . In sensitive guinea pig model , guinea pig vaccinate BCG , MVA85A , second viral vector , fowlpox express antigen 85A , 6/6 guinea pig alive end experiment , compare 2/6 guinea pig vaccinate BCG alone , 0/6 control animal ( Williams et al , 2005 ) . In rhesus macaque , BCG prime-MVA85A Fowlpox85A boost immunogenic vaccine alone , protective BCG alone ( verrek et al , unpublished data ) . Clinical study use MVA85A MVA85A ( dose 5 x 107pfu ) administer 48 healthy volunteer UK , 21 healthy volunteer The Gambia 18 South Africa , serious adverse event . We design Phase I study allow vaccination volunteer group sequentially step-wise increase mycobacterial exposure , order minimize possibility Koch reaction . A Koch reaction describes development immunopathology person animal tuberculosis , exaggerate immune response M.tb stimulate . It describe patient TB disease Koch perform original study employ mycobacteria type therapeutic vaccination . It demonstrate mouse model therapeutic vaccination ( Taylor , 2003 ) . Available animal data suggest reaction occur mice latently infect M.tb , suggest reaction may correlate high bacterial load Koch phenomenon may pose problem vaccination healthy albeit latently infect human . We start study healthy volunteer mycobacterially naïve possible . They skin test negative Elispot negative PPD , ESAT 6 CFP10 , previously vaccinate BCG . We complete study UK vaccinate volunteer previously vaccinate BCG ( McShane , Nature Med , 2004 ) The Gambia . There two ongoing study Oxford . The first phase I trial safety immunogenicity MVA85A individual latently infect M.tb . We vaccinate 12 volunteer serious adverse event . The second dose selection study evaluate safety immunogenicity 2 different dos MVA85A ( 1x10^8 1x10^7 pfu ) , healthy adult volunteer previously vaccinate BCG . Here vaccinate 11 individual high dose ( 1x10^8 ) serious adverse event , main side effect fever 24-48 hour post-vaccination , completely resolve 24 hour . Results low dose arm collect next month .</detailed_description>
