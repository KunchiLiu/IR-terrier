	<brief_summary>Asthma common , serious illness among child United States . While low dose inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) may effectively control symptom , child may require additional medication maintain adequate asthma control . This study compare effectiveness high dose ICS , ICS combine long-acting beta-agonist ( LABA ) medication , ICS combine leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) medication reduce impact severity asthma exacerbation occur child mild moderate persistent asthma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Almost 9 million child United States asthma , lead cause hospitalization school absenteeism . Common asthma symptom include wheeze , shortness breath , chest tightness , cough . While cure asthma , child receive proper treatment able control symptom lead normal life . Low dos ICS commonly prescribe prevent symptom keep asthma control . While usually sufficient prevent asthma attack , child respond well low dose ICS alone . For child , asthma symptom may effectively control either receive high dose ICS receive LABA LTRA medication combination low dose ICS . Both LABA LTRA medication use help control moderate severe asthma . The purpose study compare effectiveness high dose ICS versus low dose ICS plus either LABA LTRA medication improve asthma control reduce severity symptom occur child mild moderate persistent asthma . This study begin 8-week screening period participant monitor use inhaler low dose ICS medication . During time , participant also attend one two study visit . At visit , participant underwent physical examination , exhale nitric oxide analysis , lung function airway pressure test . After enrollment criterion meet , participant underwent evaluation , complete questionnaire assess asthma control , quality life , home environmental factor . Blood collect methacholine challenge test complete , artificially trigger asthma attack determine severity individual 's asthma . Participants randomly assign one six treatment sequence , include follow three regimen different order : - Low dose ICS salmeterol , LABA medication - Low dose ICS montelukast , LTRA medication - Double dose ICS Each treatment period last 16 week , study visit occur weekly . A physical examination , blood collection , lung function airway pressure testing , methacholine challenge test , questionnaire occur select visit . Throughout study , participant record asthma symptom , peak expiratory flow rate , rescue medication usage daily diary . The entire length study exceed 56 week .</detailed_description>
