	<brief_title>Growth Hormone Secretagogue MK-0677 Effect IGF-1 Levels ESRD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With development progression chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , malnutrition becomes increasingly severe problem . This thought occur two mechanism : decrease appetite secondary uremia development catabolic inflammatory milieu . Patients experience decrease muscle mass functional activity associate increased morbidity mortality . Many therapy improve poor nutritional state use little success . Growth hormone ( GH ) insulin like growth hormone ( IGF-1 ) improve muscle mass , quality life , nutritional parameter , immune physical function must give parenterally limited expense patient compliance . Recently , endogenous GH receptor secretagogue ( GHRS ) ghrelin show raise endogenous GH improve food intake must give parenterally available . The experimental drug MK-0677 , synthetic GHRS , ghrelin mimetic , give orally , recently show increase IGF-1 muscle mass elderly . Its effect CKD ESRD unknown . We study effect MK-0677 renal patient . Specifically , hope show drug increase IGF-1 renal patient , similar effect exogenous GH IGF-1 . Subjects ESRD hemodialysis patient . This protocol investigator-initiated , randomize , double-blind crossover , placebo-controlled pilot study . The study 's primary outcome IGF-1 level subject . Secondary outcome level cytokine , esterase , leptin , insulin , ghrelin , TNF-alpha , CRPs , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-10 , adiponectin .</detailed_description>
