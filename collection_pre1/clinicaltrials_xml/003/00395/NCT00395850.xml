	<brief_summary>This study examine influence dopamine beta-hydroxylase enzyme activity clinical efficacy novel pharmacotherapy , disulfiram , treat cocaine dependence cocaine-dependent patient , opioid dependent maintain FDA-approved opioid agonist . Cocaine dependence well co-morbid cocaine opioid-dependence associate public health issue poorer treatment prognosis admit methadone maintenance . Yet effective pharmacotherapies develop treat cocaine dependence date . One novel pharmacotherapy , disulfiram , show promise treatment disorder several clinical trial dose 250 mg/day ( e.g. , Carroll et al. , 1998 , 2004 ) . This 14-week , randomize , double blind clinical trial provide treatment to160 cocaine-dependent individual , age 18-65 year . Participants opioid dependent stabilize methadone maintenance first 2 week baseline cocaine use assess ; participant stratify DBH genotype randomly assign receive disulfiram either 0 , 250 , 375 500 mg/day . During induction onto methadone opioid dependent individual , participant administer increase dos methadone daily basis maintenance dos attain . At begin week 3 , participant receive methadone , relevant , plus disulfiram placebo disulfiram accord randomized assignment , maintain study medication ( ) week 14 . At end study , participant undergo detoxification opioid agonist , relevant , active/placebo medication 4- 6-week period . All participant receive weekly 1-hour psychotherapy ( Cognitive Behavioral Treatment ) experience clinician specifically train deliver therapy receive ongoing supervision . Participants undergo delay discounting session week 1 . The primary outcome retention , reduction opioid cocaine use , assess self-report confirm thrice-weekly urinalysis , disulfiram side-effects profile . Secondary outcome include reduction illicit drug alcohol use , improvement psychosocial functioning . The prognostic relevance genotype DBH locus , DÎ²H activity , etc. , response disulfiram examine .</brief_summary>
