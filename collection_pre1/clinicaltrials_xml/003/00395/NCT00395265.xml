	<detailed_description>The long-term effect venous thrombosis , know collectively PTS , include persistent swelling , pain , cramp , numbness leg . These symptom result impaired return blood vein low leg heart . PTS believe occur result direct damage valve wall vein . There may specific factor make certain individual prone PTS . Individuals obese , genetic predisposition blood clot disorder , high level inflammation biomarkers may increase risk develop venous disease . The purpose study investigate possible link factor occurrence chronic venous disease PTS . The study 's finding useful develop new prevention treatment strategy . This study examine previously collect data participant San Diego Population Study , study gather information prevalence chronic venous disease multi-ethnic group individual . There study visit specifically study . Researchers examine store genetic biologic sample 370 control participant 370 participant chronic venous disease . Specifically , level inflammation biomarkers , level obesity-related biomarkers , genetic predisposition blood clot disorder study .</detailed_description>
