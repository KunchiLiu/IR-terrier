	<brief_summary>The investigator propose study pattern metabolite change subject asthma determine predictable pattern prior , post , clinical exacerbation . Hypothesis : 1 . Metabolite profile change prior detection clinical exacerbation subject asthma . 2 . There measurable temporal delay metabolite profile return baseline follow anti-inflammatory therapy exacerbation asthma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Asthma/Steroid Withdrawal Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methods : We propose study 20 , non-smoking , asthmatic adult . Subjects recruit outpatient asthma clinic Edmonton . All subject meet GINA criterion mild persistent moderate persistent asthma . Following informed consent obtain blood , induce sputum urine sample overnight fast free caffeine least 24 hour . We also obtain routine demographic information include age , sex , usual asthma medication usage . We obtain health relate quality life status use generic ( 15D ) disease specific ( Asthma Quality Life ) questionnaires . Subjects instruct regard use peak flow meter typical symptom associate loss asthma control . They instruct regard access dedicate asthma website incorporates question ( Visit 1 ) . There also place subject enter twice daily peak flow measurement . The website password protect subject access individualize data entry page . A research coordinator able access subject data use unique password . We use internet-based program monitor daily PEF daily asthma symptom . Patients instructed access website daily reassess 2 week . Subjects instruct continue usual asthma management log asthma website daily record symptom twice daily peak flow . Only subject meeting criterion well control asthma ( GOAL criterion ) along objective compliance study protocols 2 week enrol next phase study . Phase 1 . After two week , subject return ( Visit 2 ) . At time blood ( 10 ml ) urine sample obtain stored subsequent metabolomic analysis . An exhaled gas sample collect analyzed nitric oxide concentration use sensitive chemiluminescence technique . An induced sputum sample also obtain use standardized protocol cell count differential determine . The remainder sputum sample also store subsequent analysis . All test perform morning overnight fast . Phase 2 . During second phase study , subject instruct reduce controller medication ( inhaled corticosteroid alone combine inhaled corticosteroid long act beta 2 agonist ) 50 % e.g . 4 puff daily 2 puff daily . Subjects log website daily 4 week experience mild exacerbation ( see definition ) . If experience clinical exacerbation , instructed return hospital site repeat blood , urine , exhale air sputum test obtain ( Visit 3a ) . They instruct increase controller medication continue increase steroid phase study . Those experience clinical exacerbation return hospital site end four week ( Visit 3b ) . They repeat blood , urine sputum sample instruct eliminate controller medication four week experience clinical exacerbation . Those experience clinical exacerbation treat outlined . Those continue experience clinical good control bring back four week repeat blood , urine , exhale air sputum analysis ( Visit 3c ) . Throughout 4-8 week period inhale steroid withdrawal , patient ask save urine sample three time weekly . These sample store pre-labeled container freezer pick study coordinator weekly interval . Phase 3 . After patient experience mild exacerbation end 8 week steroid reduction elimination , patient enter final phase study . At time patient instructed increase controller medication back baseline value . They follow four week repeat blood , urine , exhale air sputum sample obtain ( Visit 4 ) . Finally , subject instruct double usual controller medication four week repeat blood , urine sputum sample obtain . Again , subject collect store urine sample frequency 3 time per week . The subject instruct resume usual asthma controller medication dose study complete ( Visit 5 ) . All test perform morning overnight fast . A mild exacerbation define one follow event : 1 . A decrease peak flow le 80 % best effort two consecutive day . 2 . An increase reliever medication ( fast act beta 2 agonist ) 50 % baseline need two consecutive day 3 . Waking night due asthma two consecutive night A severe exacerbation define need additional medical contact treatment asthma ( e.g . Emergency Room , Walk-in Clinic ) hospital admission asthma . The need oral corticosteroid also constitute severe exacerbation . If point subject undergo severe exacerbation , examine either treat physician one physician associate study appropriate escalation treatment commence . The REB inform severe exacerbation . The study coordinator one study physicians available pager around clock course study .</detailed_description>
