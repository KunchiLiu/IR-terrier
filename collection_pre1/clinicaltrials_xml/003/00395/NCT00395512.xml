	<brief_title>Efficacy Alogliptin With Pioglitazone ( Actos® ) Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 19 million people United States diagnose diabetes mellitus , 90 % 95 % type 2 . The prevalence type 2 diabetes varies among racial ethnic population show correlate age , obesity , family history , history gestational diabetes , physical inactivity . Over next decade , mark increase number adult diabetes mellitus expect , place ever-increasing burden family health care system . Current pharmacologic intervention type 2 diabetes mellitus include diverse range antidiabetic medication different mechanism action include insulin insulin analogue , sulfonylurea , metformin , meglitinides , thiazolidinediones , inhibitor alpha- glucosidase , analogs glucagon-like peptide-1 , synthetic analogue human amylin . Despite variety medication , many clinically important potentially life-threatening side effect , restrict use many subpopulation , concern long-term tolerability , challenge relate compliance due side effect route administration . All reason contribute difficulty patient reach target glycosylated hemoglobin level less 7 % . SYR-322 ( alogliptin ) selective , orally available inhibitor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme . Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enzyme think primarily responsible vivo degradation 2 peptide hormone release response nutrient ingestion , namely glucagon-like peptide-1 glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide . Both peptide exert important effect islet beta cell stimulate glucose-dependent insulin secretion well regulate beta cell proliferation cytoprotection . Glucagon-like peptide-1 , glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide , inhibit gastric emptying , glucagon secretion , food intake . Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide show enhance insulin secretion direct interaction glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide -specific receptor islet beta cell . The glucose-lowering action glucagon-like peptide-1 , glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide , preserve patient type 2 diabetes mellitus . Pioglitazone ( ACTOS® ) thiazolidinedione develop Takeda Chemical Industries , Ltd. ( Osaka , Japan ) approve treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus . Pioglitazone selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist decrease insulin resistance periphery liver result increased insulin-dependent glucose disposal decrease hepatic glucose output . As rate newly diagnose case type 2 diabetes mellitus continue grow , need product provide good glycemic control improve safety tolerability . Alogliptin pioglitazone complementary action . Alogliptin inhibits degradation glucagon-like peptide-1 inhibiting enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV , thus augment glucose-dependent insulin secretion pioglitazone peripheral hepatic insulin sensitizer . Given complementary mechanism action alogliptin ( stimulate insulin secretion ) pioglitazone ( enhances insulin sensitivity ) , addition combination therapy treatment naïve type 2 diabetes patient may potentially allow patient reach maintain glycosylated hemoglobin goal effectively . The aim study evaluate effectiveness combination alogliptin pioglitazone patient inadequately control diet exercise alone . Study participation anticipate approximately 8.5 month .</detailed_description>
