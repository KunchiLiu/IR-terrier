	<detailed_description>Device replacement occur many reason , include elective replacement indication ( ERI ) , manufacturer advisory , upgrade . Recently pacemaker implantable cardioverter ( ICD ) advisory create dilemma physician patient . While risk device malfunction low , replacement rate follow advisory usually high complication rate follow device replacement widely know . One retrospective analysis ICD advisories Canada report 18.3 % replacement rate , subsequent 8.1 % complication rate directly relate replacement . Device replacement also occur order upgrade exist system . Clinical study show cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) significantly reduce all-cause mortality hospitalization patient advance heart failure ( HF ) . As result expand indication therapy , many standard ICD patient upgrade CRT-D system . Complication rate related upgrades system also widely know . To knowledge , risk complication follow device replacement study prospectively patient population . Limited data available guide physician weigh risk benefit device replacement . This prospective multi-center study . 1750 patient 100 clinical site enrol prior generator replacement . Patients implant follow 6 month assess complication related replacement procedure . Patients legally market device explant enrol . The replacement device manufacturer .</detailed_description>
