	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) common cause mortality patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) end-stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) . Reasons great incidence CVD group include traditional CVD risk factor hypertension , dyslipidemia diabetes importantly also include non-traditional risk factor calcium phosphate imbalance . The latter thought likely contribute vascular calcification , especially dialysis , turn lead arterial stiffness leave ventricular hypertrophy , two common cardiovascular complication . Arterial stiffness calcification find independent predictor all-cause cardiovascular mortality CKD . Few study , though , look structural functional change associate calcification interventional study address issue . Control calcium phosphate level CKD occur use medication reduce elevate serum phosphate ( phosphate binder , mostly calcium-based ) treat hyperparathyroidism ( vitamin D recently calcium sense receptor agonist call calcimimetics ) . These pharmacological management address calcium phosphate imbalance reduce vascular calcification CVD . Bisphosphonate therapy may also role reduction calcification . Low bone mineral density ( BMD ) common CKD patient predicts increase fracture risk similar general population . Bisphosphonate therapy improve BMD lower fracture risk . Bisphosphonates may also role secondary hyperparathyroidism reduce hypercalcemia allow aggressive calcitriol treatment . Recent study address possibility bisphosphonates reduce progression vascular calcification CKD reveal extent calcification may suppress association reduction chronic inflammatory response . The investigator aim perform prospective , randomise study assess impact alendronate cardiovascular bone mineral parameter . This single-centre study involve subject CKD Stage 3 ( patient GFR 30 59ml/min ) . Arterial stiffness ( pulse wave analysis pulse wave velocity ) vascular calcification ( use CT scan superficial femoral artery ) follow well serum marker calcium , phosphate PTH . Differences end-points compare participant take alendronate . The study conduct 12 month period investigator aim recruit 50 patient ( 25 alendronate 25 control ) .</brief_summary>
