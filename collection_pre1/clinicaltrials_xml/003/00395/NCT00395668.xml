	<brief_title>TETRA ( Terrestrial Trunked Radio )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TETRA term use describe technology know Terrestrial Trunked Radio . It European standard digital mobile radio communication system . TETRA primarily develop enable deployment secure , digital PMR ( Professional Mobile Radio ) service require public safety emergency service ( police , fire paramedic ) . The TETRA system specify work within VHF UHF band ( 150 MHz 900 MHz ) [ Chadwick , 2003 ] , operate often frequencies around 400 MHz . The low frequency mean TETRA less vulnerable interference , vital aspect communication emergency service . The system make possible offer complete coverage emergency service . One TETRA feature signal transmitted burst repeat . The result power modulation RF signal frequency 17,6 Hz ( time pr . second ) [ NRPB , 2001 ] . This pulsing lead concern effect health . Since pulse occurs transmission TETRA handset base station , concern related health effect user TETRA handset . The aim asses whether exposure TETRA handset affect cognitive function high level brain function learn problem solve volunteer test compare performance without exposure . Sham exposure ( radiation handset ) vs. TETRA signal ( low carrier frequency , standard TDMA pulse 17,6 Hz selection length exposures realistic SAR value ) . 56 healthy male age 25-50 year work within public safety emergency service ( police , fire paramedic ) , plan use study . Subjects must identify potential user TETRA system . A climatic chamber Department Environmental Occupational Medicine , Aarhus University , modify absorb line dampen reflection wall . The climatic chamber modify make screened room prevent external RF field , extent low frequency field , enter chamber . Except cable keyboard screen electromagnetic radiator chamber . The study double blind noise ( acoustic electric ) relate exposure person responsible exposure exposure assessment able see . The investigator knowledgeable exposure contact subject staff measurement . This double blinding continue basic statistical analysis conduct .</detailed_description>
