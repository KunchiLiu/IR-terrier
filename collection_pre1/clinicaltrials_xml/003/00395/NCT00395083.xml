	<brief_summary>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY : Purpose : To evaluate efficacy cost-effectiveness novel intervention incorporate self-management education , action plan , case-management decrease risk hospitalization due chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) among veteran severe COPD . Hypotheses : Primary Hypothesis : Veterans COPD receive self-management program incorporating education session , development action plan , case-management decrease risk COPD hospitalization compare standardized COPD care . Primary Objective : In intent-to-treat analysis , determine efficacy comprehensive self-management program reducing risk COPD hospitalization veteran severe COPD comparison patient receive standardized COPD care . Secondary Hypotheses : Compared standardize COPD care , veteran COPD receive comprehensive self-management intervention : A ) decrease health-related cost result decreased hospitalization outpatient utilization , B ) decrease hospitalization rate average length stay due COPD all-cause admission , C ) improvement set outcomes include mortality , health-related quality life , medication adherence , patient satisfaction , disease knowledge , skill acquisition self-efficacy . Secondary Objectives : To evaluate healthcare cost , hospitalization day , mortality , adherence , health outcome comprehensive self-management program compare standardize COPD care among patient severe COPD measure : A ) Healthcare-related cost B ) Health service use due COPD cause C ) Clinical outcome measure 1 .

The study conduct 2 phase , 12-month feasibility study conduct 6 VA site follow full study additional 8 site enroll patient next 24 month . As result , 180 patient initially enrol feasibility study first year remain 780 patient enrolled second third year study full study implement . Subjects follow completion study , least one , four year . The primary outcome time first COPD hospitalization . Exacerbations among patient COPD result costly emergency room visit hospitalization . The overall direct indirect medical cost COPD United States 2000 estimate excess $ 30 billion . In VA health care system , 16,073 discharge COPD fiscal year 2003 average cost $ 9,400 ( 2005 dollar ) . Disease management program COPD may improve patient self-care , improve symptom result decreased exacerbation . However , implement type publish program use self-management education case-management require additional resource VA . The COPD disease management program describe proposal develop extensive modification exist program use strong theory-based evidence-based element , take advantage exist VA system . By target patient high risk exacerbation , study focus population need potential impact great . The intervention design enable patient COPD manage disease effectively , monitor symptom initiate appropriate action symptom worsen . The element program develop use self-efficacy theory , recognize powerful predictor health-related behavior change . The goal intervention inform activated patient work inform , skilled case manager improve self-management COPD ultimately clinical outcome . Case-management program use improve outcome reduce health care utilization among patient chronic disease diabetes , congestive heart failure asthma , suggest approach may successful COPD . A study conduct Canada Dr. Bourbeau , co-investigator proposal , suggest intensive home-based self-management education program case-management reduce risk COPD hospitalization 35 % 1-year , reduced average hospital day 42 % . Cost-savings result decreased hospitalization offset cost intervention , intervention potentially cost-saving . Relying home visit , intervention practical affordable VA , therefore study evaluate whether novel case-management intervention COPD develop specifically VA reduce hospitalization without increase overall health-care cost . Because majority health care cost patient COPD due hospitalization exacerbation , COPD admission primary outcome principal self-management goal . Assessing cost-effectiveness intervention critical component propose study , provide data evidence-based decision VA physicians manager regard management COPD .</detailed_description>
