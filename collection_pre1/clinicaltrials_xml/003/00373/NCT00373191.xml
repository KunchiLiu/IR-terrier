	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Measure effect surgery radiation concentration high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) woman newly diagnose stage I-III invasive breast cancer ductal carcinoma situ . - Measure effect chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy concentration hsCRP patient . - Summarize difference preoperative peri-chemotherapy hsCRP concentration separately patient receive growth factor chemotherapy . - Observe change hsCRP concentration gene methylation time local systemic treatment patient . - Explore prevalence baseline change methylation panel gene know frequently specifically hypermethylated breast cancer . OUTLINE : This prospective study . A blood sample collect baseline , approximately 1 week surgery , time routine follow-up visit 3-6 month completion local systemic therapy , except patient receive endocrine therapy . For patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy , blood sample collect prior begin chemotherapy final 2 course chemotherapy . For patient receive radiotherapy , blood sample collect final 2 week radiotherapy . For patient receive endocrine therapy , blood sample collect 2 6 month start endocrine therapy . Patients also complete questionnaire overall health concurrent medication baseline follow-up visit . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
