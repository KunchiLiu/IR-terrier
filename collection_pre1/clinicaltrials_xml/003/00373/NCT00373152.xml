	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiofrequency ablation use high-frequency , electric current kill tumor cell . Diagnostic procedure , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , may help learn well radiofrequency ablation work kill breast cancer cell help doctor predict whether breast cancer cell remain treatment . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well MRI work predict tumor response radiofrequency ablation woman invasive breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Predicting Tumor Reponse After Radiofrequency Ablation Women With Invasive Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) induce complete tumor necrosis woman invasive breast cancer . Secondary - Determine whether breast MRI accurately predict residual cancer tumor necrosis patient treat RFA . - Determine toxicity RFA patient . - Determine cosmetic outcome RFA patient . OUTLINE : This prospective , nonrandomized study . Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) use gadopentetate dimeglumine . Within next day , patient undergo radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) approximately 20-30 minute . Patients undergo second DCE-MRI 3 21 day RFA , follow definitive surgery ( standard mastectomy lumpectomy ) . Pathologic confirmation post-ablation DCE-MRI finding perform within 1 21 day second MRI . Tumor cell viability proliferative activity assess immunohistochemical biomarker analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis invasive breast cancer follow information must know base needle core biopsy : tumor grade , hormone receptor status , HER2/neu status . Patients previous history either ipsilateral contralateral excisional biopsy exclude . However , patient exclude excisional biopsy use diagnose current breast cancer . Note : Subjects undergo sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) biopsy exclude research study . It expect radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) interfere SLN procedure study demonstrate accuracy sentinel node stag excisional biopsy . The axillary staging subject note . Tumor size &lt; 2 centimeter mammogram ultrasound , ultrasound prefer method evaluation . Measurements physical exam also record . If mammogram ultrasound discordant , image modality determines large tumor size use determine eligibility . Ultrasound measurement : Distance tumor skin must &gt; 1 cm ; distance tumor chest wall must &gt; 1 cm . The RFA procedure , burn tumor , may also burn skin muscle close ( &lt; 1cm ) . Laboratory value within 2 week registration : platelet count ≥ 50,000 ; INR ≤ 1.6 ; serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL ; glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ≥ 60 ml/min/m^2 Age 18 year old Women must pregnant due MR scan pregnant woman FDA approve . All female childbearing potential must urine study within 2 week prior registration rule . Breast feeding must discontinue prior study entry . Subjects neoadjuvant therapy plan exclude study Patients history severe asthma and/or allergy exclude avoid potential adverse reaction MRI contrast agent ( GdDTPA ) Patients pacemaker , ferromagnetic implant ferromagnetic object exclude Patients obesity ( &gt; 250 pound ) exclude due limited diameter magnet bore tube Patients history severe claustrophobia exclude Patient must give write informed consent indicate investigational nature study potential risk</criteria>
