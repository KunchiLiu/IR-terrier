	<brief_title>Epidural Blood Patch Resolution Postdural Puncture Headache ( PDPH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accidental dural puncture common ( rate 1 50-250 obstetric hospital ) , arguably , important complication epidural insertion . After breach dura 16-18 gauge epidural needle adult patient age 18-60 year , incidence post-dural puncture headache ( PDPH ) 80-90 % . This headache frequently severe incapacitating , markedly postural least several day duration . Associated symptom include nausea vomiting , auditory disturbance ocular symptom . PDPH often interfere maternal -infant interaction restrict prevent ambulation case confine new mother bed supine position . It significant cause increase nursing anaesthetic staff workload prolong hospitalisation . Accidental dural puncture PDPH may also rarely also associate morbidity , cranial nerve palsy ( III , IV , V , VI , VII , VIII ) pain dysaesthesia ; subdural haematoma . Fatalities report follow brainstem `` coning '' prolong low intracranial pressure headache . Untreated , headache may become chronic persist month even year . The mechanism PDPH clearly understood , although consistent low intracranial pressure headache . Although image study support precipitate event loss cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , volume loss directly relate risk headache . The change intracranial CSF dynamic , reduction pressure , consider important . Reduction CSF pressure may influence number factor , include volume lumbar subarachnoid CSF compartment , rate CSF loss replenishment movement CSF associate patient positioning . The rate change intracranial CSF pressure may relevant specific pressure level , explain sudden onset headache ( mediate vasodilation ) patient assume upright position hydrostatic force redistribute intracranial CSF spinal CSF compartment . Of procedural factor associate failure EBP , clear whether volume blood inject relevant . Despite 40 year clinical use , remain uncertain much blood inject practice varies . An apparent relationship volume efficacy moot , base mainly historical feature EBP . The injection autologous blood first suggest Gormley 1960 , inspire impression ( since show erroneous ) dural puncture accompany `` blood tap '' less likely result headache . He claim 100 % cure 2-3 ml blood inject 8 patient . In 1970 1972 DiGiovanni et al describe two series 108 patient total , large volume 5-10 ml blood lead permanent cure 90 % . In 1974 , average volume 10 ml say cured 182 185 patient , volume less 10 ml appear less successful . Taivainen et al could detect advantage 15 ml versus 10 ml , volume choose accord height patient . Crawford describe experience EBP 1980 . He start 6-15 ml blood 16 patient report recurrence PDPH within 2 day third patient . A repeat EBP 20 ml cure 4 , lead change routine administration 20 ml . The next 100 patient receive 17-20 ml , 'total success ' claim 80 83 give 20 ml . However , know high success rate may reflect inadequate duration quality follow-up . Crawford review experience EBP 1985 , claim complete permanent relief achieve 91 % 20 ml blood inject 83 % less volume use . Crawford 's influence , past 20 year , recommendation use 20 ml autologous blood establish practice . Further support use large volume blood come series Brownridge . He find 10 ml less blood produce permanent relief 75 % . In addition clinical imaging study Szeinfeld et al . report average 15 ml ( range 12-18 ml ) successful result mean segmental spread blood 9 ( range 7-14 ) spinal segment . In vitro , EBP capable tamponading 40 mm Hg pressure dural puncture small spinal needle , although less effective hole make Tuohy needle . The mass effect EBP disappear hour , although focal clot may remain adherent dura within subarachnoid space .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Obstetric patient age 18 year Postdural puncture headache ( PDPH ) confirm likely unintentional dural puncture epidural needle . PDPH define `` A headache clear postural characteristic ( onset significant exacerbation erect relieve significantly diminish lie flat ) . The diagnosis support distribution frontal occipital region , associate neck ache . '' Medically suitable consented epidural blood patch ( EBP ) treatment PDPH Previous epidural blood patch ( EBP ) relate unintentionl dural puncture ( include prophylactic EBP ) EBP perform 5 day unintentional dural puncture . History significant low radicular back pain ( require treatment ) pregnancy Women dural puncture occur time epidural needle insertion EBP Diagnosis PDPH subsequently confirm .</criteria>
