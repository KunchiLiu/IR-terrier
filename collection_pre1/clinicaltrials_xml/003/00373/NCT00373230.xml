	<brief_title>Treating Obesity Underserved Overweight Populations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity reach epidemic proportion nearly two-thirds US population either overweight obese . Ethnic minority disproportionately affect 37 % African-American adult obese . Obesity also inversely related socioeconomic status . In Pennsylvania , prevalence obesity increase 14.7 % 1991 24.0 % 2002 , annual medical expenditure attributable obesity estimate $ 4.2 billion ; make Pennsylvania 4th high state country term obesity-related cost . The prevalence obesity match serious medical consequence include type 2 diabetes , hypertension , dyslipidemia , atherosclerotic disease . The core pathogenetic factor underlie condition appear insulin resistance . Weight loss diet physical activity desirable way reduce insulin resistance ( IR ) . Weight loss 8-10 % associate significant improvement IR . While clinic-based weight loss program tertiary medical center produce clinically significant loss , cost location program make inaccessible underserved population ( e.g. , inner city African Americans rural poor ) need . Moreover , common outcome weight loss treatment weight regain . Thus , novel strategy improve weight loss maintenance accessible need priority research focus application . Based expertise behavioral weight management telemedicine , study determine telemedicine system help participant , undergone weight loss program base church community center , maintain weight loss 1 year period . Overweight obese men woman ( n = 400 ) participate 16-week behavioral weight loss program local church community center . After 16 week , participant randomize either `` In-person '' follow-up group `` telemedicine '' group 1-year . The latter provide support self-monitoring , education , supervise chat room , bulletin board , e-mail . Assessments body weight , body composition insulin sensitivity conduct baseline , 16 68 week . Based recent data , predict great maintenance weight loss ( low body weight ) 68 week Telemedicine group compare `` In person group '' .</detailed_description>
