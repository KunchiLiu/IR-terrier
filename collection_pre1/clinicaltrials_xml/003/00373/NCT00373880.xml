	<brief_title>Effects Aripiprazole Cocaine Craving Self-Administration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite recent increase data cocaine 's basic neurochemical mechanism action , progress towards development effective pharmacological treatment cocaine abuse disappointing . We propose use laboratory model repeat dose cocaine self-administration ass potential efficacy novel antipsychotic , aripiprazole . Aripiprazole partial agonist dopamine D2 receptor serotonin 5HT1a receptor , antagonize 5HT2a receptor . By function partial D2 agonist , aripiprazole hypothesize function D2 antagonist hypodopaminergic state , cocaine use , function D2 agonist hypodopaminergic state , cocaine withdrawal . This 42-day , outpatient/inpatient/outpatient/inpatient protocol evaluate effect aripiprazole maintenance ( 0 , 15 mg/day ) cocaine craving , subjective effect , self-administration use within-subjects design . Non-treatment seek cocaine abuser maintain outpatient 16 day dose maintenance prior inpatient cocaine self-administration session . During inpatient phase , volunteer live hospital clinical research unit participate laboratory session opportunity choose repeat dos smoke cocaine $ 5 . In addition measure cocaine self-administration , measure cardiovascular subjective effect cocaine aripiprazole maintenance condition .</detailed_description>
