	<detailed_description>Exercise , cornerstone PR , effective improve dyspnea , function , health relate quality life ( HRQL ) patient COPD . However , improvement gradually dissipate follow program completion . There currently successful intervention support patient ' persistence community-based exercise PR closely monitor potentially negative impact COPD exacerbation exercise behavior . Emerging technology wirelessly enable personal digital assistant ( PDA ) may provide innovative mean support exercise persistence real-time collaborative monitoring exercise sign symptom COPD exacerbation reinforcement enhance exercise self-efficacy . Patient graduate two PR program COPD ( n=20 ) first undergo 2-week run-in prior randomize either MOBILE ( Mobilizing Support Long-term Exercise ) intervention attention control 6 month .</detailed_description>
