	<brief_title>Biomarkers Patients Undergoing Transrectal Ultrasound Prostate Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Identify unique protein peptide associated prostate cancer compare proteomic metabolomic analysis serum , plasma , urine patient histological evidence prostate cancer without prostate cancer ( transrectal ultrasound prostatic biopsy ) . Secondary - Collect seminal fluid subset patient test hypothesis fluid collect `` target organ injury '' prostate cancer high signal proteins/peptides different without cancer may help guide identification difference serum , plasma , urine . OUTLINE : This pilot study . Patients undergo collection serum , plasma , urine biomarker/laboratory analysis . Samples examine proteomic/metabolomic analysis ( mass spectrometry ) immunoassay . Patients undergo transrectal ultrasonography prostatic biopsy . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
