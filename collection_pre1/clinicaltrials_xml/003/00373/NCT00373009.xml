	<brief_summary>We study whether specific back exercise education program effectively limit development chronic low back pain Soldiers United States Army . These program represent current best evidence prevention low back pain exercise education perspective . This innovative study investigate whether combination evidence-based exercise education program effectively decrease impact chronic low back pain , compare individual evidence-based exercise education program , traditionally implemented exercise program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Low back pain ( LBP ) musculoskeletal condition account significant pain disability , consume substantial medical occupational cost annually . Specific United States Armed Forces , LBP second common reason seek healthcare affect 150,000 active duty Soldiers annually ( MSMR 2003 ) . Soldiers U.S. Army LBP high risk disability 5 year injury . Furthermore , military review suggest LBP common condition bring medical board , lifetime direct compensation cost estimate reach billion dollar . Therefore , reduction disability LBP significant research priority military . Reduction disability LBP divide 2 separate phase - primary secondary prevention . Primary prevention refers intervention strategy implement low back injury occurs.8 Primary prevention reduces LBP related disability reduce total number people eventually experience episode LBP . Secondary prevention refers intervention strategy implement acute episode low back injury , chronic symptom occur.9 Secondary prevention reduces LBP related disability reduce number people eventually experience chronic disability LBP . We propose innovative approach LBP prevention combine primary secondary prevention strategy potential limit development chronic LBP Soldiers . The primary prevention strategy core stabilization exercise program ( CSEP ) . The CSEP use study sound biomechanical anatomical rationale , demonstrate clinical efficacy prevent future recurrence LBP . However , CSEP previously investigate primary prevention LBP healthy Soldiers . The secondary prevention strategy psychosocial education program ( PSEP ) . The PSEP use study sound theoretical rationale . It also demonstrate clinical efficacy favorably alter LBP belief , well limit eventual severity LBP episodes . These program ( individually combination ) investigate prevention chronic LBP healthy Soldiers . Therefore , train healthy Soldiers United States Army CSEP , PSEP , combine CSEP/PSEP . We compare preventative effect exercise education program already implement traditional exercise program ( TEP ) . Objective/Hypothesis : The purpose study determine combine prevention program effective limiting development chronic LBP compare effect individual evidence-based prevention program , traditional exercise program Specific Aims Specific Aim 1 : We determine combine prevention program consist CSEP PSEP prevents development chronic LBP . During advanced individual training ( AIT ) , United States Army Soldiers randomly assign receive 1 4 prevention program . Soldiers follow monthly measure LBP occurrence severity 2 year active duty web-based data collection system manage University Florida . Specific Aim 2 : We determine CSEP result favorable change specific core musculature associate reduce LBP . The CSEP activate specific core musculature important preventing LBP . We use real-time ultrasound image document change core musculature occur AIT . We also determine PSEP result favorable change LBP belief . The PSEP educate individual evidence-based , psychosocial approach management LBP , decrease likelihood experience chronic LBP . We use validated self-report questionnaire measure Soldiers ' LBP belief regard outcome management . We measure LBP belief AIT ( 12-week period ) . Study Design : Cluster randomize clinical trial . Twelve company Soldiers ( n = 2700 ) reporting advance individual training 91 W military occupational specialty training randomly assign CSEP PSEP ( combine education exercise prevention program ) , CSEP ( exercise prevention program ) , PSEP TEP ( educational prevention program ) , TEP ( standard physical training ) . Relevance : The result study several immediate application Soldiers . The widespread incorporation effective preventative strategy certainly result substantial reduction LBP military . Programs effectively prevent occurrence severity LBP would benefit U.S. Armed Forces improve readiness Soldiers , reduce economic burden , limit disability among Soldiers . For example , average cost $ 136.02 per LBP visit calculate 2004 . A 40 % reduction recurrence LBP completing CSEP would generate cost saving $ 3,343,230 4th fiscal year ( approximately 1/5 total cost LBP one FY ) .</detailed_description>
