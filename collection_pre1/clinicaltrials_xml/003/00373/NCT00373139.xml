	<brief_summary>It common practice emergency medicine department rapidly assess pregnancy status use either urine serum pregnancy test . Using whole blood instead urine would facilitate much rapid emergency department identification pregnancy status . No study date utilized whole blood rapid detection pregnancy status . Set busy adult emergency room Maimonides Medical Center , study recruit sample woman reproductive age ( 18-55 ) , fit inclusion criterion healthy need pregnancy test purpose diagnostic testing/treatment . Blood sample take participant use hCG kit remain blood send chemistry laboratory perform reference gold standard . The reference gold standard positive test hCG level &gt; 25mlU/ml . The research investigator lab blind 's result . Kappa statistic do measurement agreement urine pregnancy result whole blood pregnancy result , whole blood result laboratory result .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Significance : Point-of-Care test rapidly detect pregnancy woman reproductive age common practice Emergency Medicine department . The patient history may always reliably identify possibility pregnancy1 , large proportion patient expose potential teratogen emergency department visit . In one study , 33 % patient receive radiographic evaluation 75 % prescribed medication2 . Additionally , pregnancy test require first step evaluation suspect , potentially life threatening , ectopic pregnancy3 . Commercially available rapid immunochemical assay detect human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) concentration &gt; 25 mlU/ml , yield result 3 minute use urine 5 minute use serum4-6 . However , clinical practice test may take much longer perform due significant delay obtain urine specimen patient , time delay require separate serum whole blood . By prolong patient wait time diagnostic testing treatment , delay may adversely impact patient outcome , emergency department crowding , patient satisfaction . Using whole blood hCG immunoassay , instead urine serum , would facilitate much rapid emergency department identification pregnant patient . Whole blood obtain immediately intravenous insertion phlebotomy , finger stick puncture use lancet manner similar obtain blood bedside glucose determination . Previous study hCG immunoassay ( less rapid immunoassay commercially available use today ) utilize whole blood well urine serum , equal sensitivities7 . However , accuracy whole blood identify pregnancy use presently available rapid immunochemical hCG test kit validate . Objective : To evaluate sensitivity specificity commercially available rapid immunochemical hCG assay kit detect pregnancy use whole blood specimen . Material &amp; Methods : Design : A prospective , blind study validation diagnostic test Setting : Two Clinical Sites : 1 . Primary Care Women 's Center Maimonides Medical Center , locate 5008 Fort Hamilton Parkway , Brooklyn , New York . 2 . Adult Emergency Department Maimonides Medical Center , locate Fort Hamilton Parkway 49th Street , Brooklyn , New York . Sample : A convenience sample healthy woman two setting , meet follow inclusion exclusion criterion : Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Healthy adult woman child bear age . 2. Who either request pregnancy test , require pregnancy test diagnostic study treatment . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Minors 2 . Adults unable independently give consent study 3 . Known pregnancy ( i.e . - patient appear obviously pregnant ) 4 . Hemodynamically unstable . 5 . Moderately severely ill-appearing moderate severe pain . 6 . Technically possible obtain blood study subject . Sample Size : If consider quantitative hCG parameter final outcome : A sample 279 positive group 279 negative group achieve 80 % power detect difference 0.0500 area ROC ( receiver operating characteristic ) curve ( AUC ) null hypothesis 0.8500 AUC alternative hypothesis 0.9000 use two-sided z-test significance level 0.0500 . The data discrete ( rating scale ) responses . The AUC compute false positive rate 0.000 1.000 . The ration standard deviation response negative group standard deviation response positive group 1.000 . If consider dichotomous outcome qualitative result hCG , instead test hypothesis : A sample size 384 ( Positive Negative test ) group require 95 % confident result would within true population parameter use follow formula : ( Py ) ( Pn ) = N Std Error2 Py Pn represent proportion people respond category dichotomous variable N represent sample size . We assume 50/50 split approach maximize variation ( i.e . Py = 0.5 Pn = 0.5 ) Type l error = .05 obtain confidence interval 95 percent . Methods : Prior enrollment study , write informed consent obtain subject . After valid consent grant , subject complete brief standardize data collection sheet determine whether meet eligibility criterion participation study . Study investigator review data . Subjects meet eligibility criterion agree participate study enrol participant . Each participant submit 5ml whole blood use exclusively research study . This blood specimen dram antecubital large upper extremity vein physician , nurse , professional phlebotomist . Each blood sample label unique identification number . One two drop blood sample use immediately study investigator perform ICON 25 rapid hCG immunoassay test ( Beckman Coulter , Miami , Florida ) . The result read 3 5 minute specimen identification number correspond result record log . The remainder whole blood specimen send Maimonides Medical Center chemistry laboratory process perform reference gold standard test , quantitative serum total hCG ( ADVIA CentaurÂ® System total hCG chemiluminometric immunoassay ; Bayer Corporation , Tarrytown , New York ) The Beckman Coulter ICON 25 kit 100 % sensitive 100 % specific hCG value &gt; 25mlU/ml . Therefore , reference gold standard positive pregnancy test quantitative serum hCG &gt; 25 mlU/ml . Investigators perform whole blood pregnancy test laboratory technician perform reference gold standard test serum blind one another 's result . Confidentiality : This study intend evaluate performance individual resident . Date study use statistical analysis study . The participant 's privacy maintain give unique ID number database analysis . Access database file protect encryption password . All data form secure locked file cabinet access limit investigator . Data Analysis : All data initially enter analyzed via SPSS . Sensitivity specificity also estimate use 2X2 table .</detailed_description>
