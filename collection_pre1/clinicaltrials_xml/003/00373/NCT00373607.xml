Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PPQ ) new co-formulated well tolerate ACT , increasingly use Southeast Asia prove highly effective Plasmodium falciparum malaria . We test efficacy , safety tolerability DHA-PPQ patient uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria . A RCT evaluate DHA-PPQ carry , 2003 2005 . Patients uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria randomly allocate receive either DHA-PPQ MAS3 63-day follow-up period . Five hundred twenty two patient include analysis , 262 allocate receive DHA-PPQ , 260 receive MAS3 . The two group comparable baseline demographic clinical characteristic . The mean time parasite clearance DHA-PPQ group 32.0 hour 35.5 hour MAS3 group . Twenty-four hour first dose , proportion patient whose cleared parasitaemia 67.2 % DHA-PPQ group , 58.1 % MAS3 group ( RR 1.25 , [ 95 % CI 1.03−1.52 ] , p = 0.017 ) .
