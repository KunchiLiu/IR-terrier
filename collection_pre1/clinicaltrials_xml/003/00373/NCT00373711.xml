	<brief_summary>The management thyroid cancer patient suspicion recurrent disease base rising/detectable level thyroglobulin ( Tg ) involve image iodine-123 whole body scintigraphy ( I-123 WBS ) F-18 FDG PET/CT . However , disease always detect . The use another iodine isotope ( I-124 ) positron emit characteristic PET/CT may allow good identification recurrent disease , thus allow patient treat I-131 curative attempt .</brief_summary>

However , disease always detect . The use another iodine isotope ( I-124 ) positron emit characteristic PET/CT may allow good identification recurrent disease , thus allow patient treat I-131 curative attempt . Conducting study hope find whether I-124 PET/CT allow detection lesion patient suspect recurrent thyroid cancer current standard care represent I-123 WBS F-18 FDG PET/CT .</detailed_description>
