	<brief_summary>It suggest patient schizophrenia smoke order produce amelioration dysfunctional dopaminergic pathway allow experience pleasure satisfaction overcome anhedonia . No study assess effect nicotine withdrawal reward responsivity patient schizophrenia . The investigator believe understand crucial improved treatment nicotine dependence develop patient population . If group already deficits reward responsivity symptom disease may particularly prone effect nicotine withdrawal reward system . Smoking cessation may lead decrease responsivity pleasurable stimulus worsen anhedonia . Treatments smoke cessation may need ameliorate increase deficit likely effective patient schizophrenia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Nicotine Withdrawal Reward Responsivity Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heavy smoking continue represent significant public health problem people general population people major mental illness . Twenty-four percent adult general population smoke estimate 74-92 % people schizophrenia smoke . While effective treatment smoke cessation develop , response rate modest relapse rate high . Approximately 70 % people quit smoke effective treatment relapse smoke within one year . A syndrome negative affect anhedonia describe important component maintenance dependence nicotine . It also suggest prevent syndrome anhedonia negative affect early abstinence may reduce relapse rate . If syndrome anhedonia measure objectively quantitatively , well able test treatment withdrawal syndrome . It hypothesis syndrome anhedonia early abstinence nicotine quantifiable deficit reward responsivity . Animal study suggest nicotine withdrawal associate alteration reward responsivity . Brain stimulation reward threshold use measure anhedonia responsivity reward animal model . Nicotine withdrawal associate significant decrease brain reward function measure elevation brain reward threshold persist 4 day . Nicotine withdrawal also associate failure condition environment pair novel stimulus , possibly due decrease reward associate novel stimulus . Drug withdrawal state also associate inhibition mesolimbic release murine model . We propose randomize placebo control trial investigate effect nicotine abstinence reward responsivity patient major mental illness patient schizophrenia . Principal Aims : Aim 1 : To evaluate effect nicotine withdrawal measure reward responsivity Hypothesis 1a : Normal control subject schizophrenia demonstrate deterioration measure reward responsivity abstinence ( placebo condition ) compare baseline . ( Primary Outcome Measure ) Aim 2 : To evaluate effect transdermal nicotine reward responsivity abstinence . Hypothesis 2a : Normal control subject schizophrenia demonstrate great response bias toward reward condition follow transdermal nicotine administration relative placebo patch 3 day period abstinence . Aim 3 : To evaluate effect smoke abstinence transdermal nicotine measure reward responsivity patient schizophrenia smoke relative normal control smoker . Hypothesis 3a : Subjects schizophrenia demonstrate decrease reward responsivity condition ( baseline , nicotine replacement therapy condition placebo condition ) relative normal control . Secondary aim : Aim 4 : To evaluate effect nicotine withdrawal cognitive function smoker Hypothesis 4a : Normal control subject schizophrenia demonstrate poor performance test cognition follow placebo administration compare baseline nicotine condition . We propose test effect smoke abstinence nicotine replacement therapy , use nicotine transdermal patch measure reward responsivity patient smoke . We propose randomize placebo control crossover trial primary outcome measure Response bias use signal detection task . Subjects 70 patient schizophrenia smoke 70 normal control smoker major mental illness match age , sex nicotine dependence . Though expect consent 70 subject group , expect 20 subject group complete study</detailed_description>
