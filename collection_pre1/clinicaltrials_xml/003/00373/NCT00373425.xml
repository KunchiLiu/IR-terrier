	<brief_title>A Study Erlotinib ( Tarceva ) After Surgery With Without Adjuvant Chemotherapy Non-Small Cell Lung Carcinoma ( NSCLC ) Patients Who Have Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Positive Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After initiation study , sponsor become aware error drug dispense module interactive voice response patient randomize prior 07 November 2007 dispense incorrect study drug least . Since integrity data patient seriously compromise , patient consider unevaluable protocol-specified analysis . These participant refer breach protocol cohort ( BPC ) still study treatment time breach offer option receive open-label erlotinib 2 year ( include posttreatment long-term follow-up assessment ) , receive open-label erlotinib remain study posttreatment long-term follow-up assessment , withdraw consent treatment assessment . Participants discontinue study treatment prior breach offer open-label erlotinib remain long-term follow-up . Data BPC participant analyze separately included assessment primary secondary endpoint randomize cohort consider part primary analyses.The sample size randomize cohort change due BPC data RC BPC analyze separately .</detailed_description>
