	<brief_title>Constraint-Induced Therapy Modified Rehabilitating Arm Function Stroke Survivors w/Plegic Hands</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Constraint-Induced Movement therapy CI therapy rehabilitation method , base behavioral neuroscience study deafferented monkey , show controlled study produce large improvement real-world upper-extremity use individual chronic stroke . Up till , survivor stroke plegic hand exclude CI therapy protocol , whether research clinical basis . Such individual estimate make least 35 % population chronic stroke residual motor deficit . Furthermore , intervention individual control evidence efficacy increase real-world function . Thus , stroke survivor represent large number healthcare consumer limit treatment option . We recently complete pilot study modify form CI therapy stroke survivor plegic hand , obtain surprisingly positive finding . Six individual enrol flicker active movement elbow wrist finger 30° active range motion shoulder . Participants receive three week CI therapy , combine mode therapy , six hour per day . The treatment package include tone management/movement facilitation , train more-impaired arm use use shaping , functional task practice , restraint less-impaired arm laboratory home indicate , package behavioral method transfer gain laboratory home situation . As group , patient show large improvement more-impaired arm use daily life treatment ( Motor Activity Log MAL ; p 's &lt; 05 , Effect Size &gt; 1.5 ) . Improvements more-impaired arm motor ability , measure score laboratory motor performance test ( graded Wolf Motor Function Test ; gWMFT ) standardize clinical examination ( Fugl-Meyer ) , also substantial ( p 's &lt; .05 ) . Based initial finding , propose randomize , control clinical trial rigorously test efficacy modification CI therapy rehabilitate arm function chronic stroke patient severe upper-extremity impairment . To end , 40 survivor stroke plegic hand randomly assign receive intervention describe placebo control procedure duration . Control participants receive either 1 ) tone management , EMG biofeedback procedure alternate block 6 hr daily 15 consecutive weekday 2 ) usual &amp; customary care . Measures arm motor ability ( gWMFT ; Fugl-Meyer ) , arm use daily life ( MAL , accelerometry ) , quality life ( Stroke Impact Scale ) administer participant treatment long-term . If modify CI therapy participant show large improvement more-impaired arm function control group participant , suggest efficacious treatment raise hop additional recovery large group healthcare consumer limit treatment option .</detailed_description>
