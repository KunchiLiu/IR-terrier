	<brief_summary>This proposal aim develop novel method model analyze clinical factor impact RV function , lead reliable , consistent , comprehensive pre-operative treatment planning . In particular , proposed work center creation accurate clinically useful heart model quantify , visualize , interpret several clinical finding central medical decision-making process . The hypothesis provide clinician 3D model capture numerous relevant patient finding integrate , quantitative manner make consistent , reliable , accurate clinical assessment may also able predict factor complicit RV dysfunction impend failure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The research propose motivate need support pediatric cardiologist make image-based decision assessment management congenital heart disease ( CHD ) . In marked contrast adult cardiology , deal almost exclusively left ventricle ( LV ) , function RV associate number life-threatening condition pediatrics . These defect include Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome ( HLHS ) , Congenitally Corrected Transposition Great Arteries , Post operative Tetralogy Fallot , Double Outlet Right Ventricle . In particular , computer model simulate myocardium blood pool right ventricle ( RV ) investigate used measure clinically useful diverse parameter RV blood flow wall behavior previously would require multiple analysis tool acquire . The model base data MRI study patient . Alternate measurement technique ultrasound catheter pressure measurement need verify efficacy model . Through retrospective chart review CHD patient defect associate RV dysfunction , data obtain CHOA five year period , June 1 , 2001 May 31 , 2006 . It collect 10 child age 0-18 year . Magnetic Resonance image , Ultrasound catheterization measurement collect analyzed . Data MR use primarily determine RV volumetric data . This information use determine RV shape different stage systole diastole . The RV shape input computer model . The computer model determine relevant clinical measure ejection fraction , pressure measurement , strain rate , wall thickening base solely MR image data . The ultrasound catheter data use independent source verification data determine computer model . Ultrasound data use compare ejection fraction wall behavior predictive model catheter data use compare pressure measurement .</detailed_description>
