	<brief_summary>Cataract prevalent throughout world IOLs routinely implant extraction cataractous lens . It frequently perform surgery United States estimate 2-3 million procedure perform annually . With age population rise , well increase popularity refractive intraocular lens , number intraocular surgery continue rise . Over year , surgical technique evolve intracapsular extraction modern phacoemulsification . This development help evolution IOLs well . The IOLs advance extensively : different material design available , permit implantation small , sutureless incision . Traditional IOLs monofocal design provide vision one distance , typically far . Patients implanted traditional monofocal IOLs usually require glass near distance task read . The new multifocal IOLs offer possibility see well one distance , without glass contact . The AcrySof ReSTOR ( Alcon Laboratories ) use apodized diffractive technology — design respond wide small eye 's pupil might — provide near , intermediate , distance vision . Clinical study use support March 2005 FDA approval show 80 % people receive lens use glass activity cataract surgery ; 84 % receive lens eye distance vision 20/25 good , near vision 20/32 better . ReZoom ( Advanced Medical Optics ) multifocal refractive zonal IOL distribute light five optical zone provide near , intermediate , distance vision . The ReZoom second-generation multifocal FDA-approved March 2005 . In European study 215 patient , 93 % ReZoom recipient report never occasionally needing glass . The combined use multifocal intraocular lens often solution best meet patient ' refractive need . There speculation implantation ReSTOR one eye ReZoom lens fellow eye provide patient large range useful vision near range . The purpose study evaluate visual outcome patient satisfaction implantation diffractive multifocal IOL ( ReSTOR ) one eye refractive multifocal IOL ( ReZoom ) fellow eye routine phacoemulsification compare control group patient implant bilaterally ReSTOR eye target 0 ±0.25 D , group patient implant bilaterally ReSTOR non-dominant eye target +1.00 D dominant eye target 0 +0.25 D .</brief_summary>
