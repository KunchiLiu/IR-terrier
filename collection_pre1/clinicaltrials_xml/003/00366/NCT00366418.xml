	<brief_summary>This study test safety effectiveness use lower-dose rituximab give frequently treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . Studies show , use week 4 week , rituximab effective 25 percent patient CLL . New evidence show use low frequent dos rituximab effective destroying leukemia cell produce good treatment response . Patients 21 year age old CLL receive treatment fludarabine may eligible study . Participants take rituximab 12 week . One dose drug infuse arm vein 30 minute either day 1 ( first dose ) day 3 ( second dose ) . All dos give injection skin . After first week , patient choose injection home . Rituximab give 3 time week total 12 week . Other medication give reduce side effect allergic reaction drug . In addition treatment , patient undergo follow test procedure : Before treatment - Medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) blood test . - Bone marrow lymph node biopsy ( surgical removal small tissue sample ) . - Computed tomography ( CT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan . CT use special x-ray provide image neck , chest , abdomen pelvis . PET use radioactive sugar identify area disease . During treatment ( study week 1-12 ) - Medical history physical examination week 3 , 6 12 evaluate drug side effect , plus weekly telephone check interim visit need . - Blood test every week evaluate blood count . Evaluations treatment ( follow-up 3 month 12 month ) - Blood test follow-up visit 3 , 6 , 9 12 month treatment evaluate blood count . - Bone marrow aspiration biopsy 3 month treatment examine effect rituximab bone marrow cell . - CT scan neck , chest , abdomen pelvis 3 , 6 , 9 12 month treatment evaluate response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lower But More Frequent Dose Rituximab Treat Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rituximab FDA approve treatment relapse refractory low grade follicular CD20+ B cell non Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( 375 mg/m ( 2 ) IV infusion weekly 4 8 dos ) . Recently , rituximab ( anti CD20 ) introduce CLL treatment regimens become attractive choice combination chemotherapy single agent treatment . Rituximab show effective low dose 375 mg/m ( 2 ) give frequently . Several theoretical consideration support laboratory evidence suggest fractionate dose schedule use low-dose rituximab could effective current i.v . schedule high-dose rituximab . Indeed , preliminary clinical evidence suggest low-dose rituximab 20mg/m2 i.v . 3-times per week lead steady clearance leukemic cell without induce substantial loss target CD20 . This Phase I/II , single agent study evaluate safety feasibility subcutaneous rituximab ( Rituxan ) administer 20 mg/day three time week 12 week subject CLL . Patients need prior treatment fludarabine , elevate absolute lymphocyte count . The primary objective test safety feasibility give rituximab subcutaneously . We also obtain secondary endpoint early estimate efficacy evidence ( ) shrinkage lymphadenopathy and/or ( b ) improvement blood value bone marrow biopsy finding .</detailed_description>
