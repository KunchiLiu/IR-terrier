Our hypothesis optical aid work well provide student large print material . Since large print material one size , level visual impairment among student varies greatly , seem apparent large print material work well student , . An optical aid design individual student 's level impairment seem hold promise help student reach maximum level performance .

	<detailed_description>The purpose Project Magnify determine two current strategy ( large print versus optical aid ) help visually impaired student improve read ability work well . Our hypothesis optical aid work well provide student large print material . Since large print material one size , level visual impairment among student varies greatly , seem apparent large print material work well student , . An optical aid design individual student 's level impairment seem hold promise help student reach maximum level performance . Although Project Magnify design increase reading ability , expect student also develop great independence confidence home community activity require use vision . Students low vision frequently give large print book read . Large print give many student opportunity access information textbook . However , several limitation strategy . First , student access print enlarge . And large print material one size , student 's level vision impairment varies greatly . So large print may fine one visually impaired student , significantly small another , way big yet third . When large print child 's option access print , struggle copy note board , find right bus bus line correctly measure chemical science laboratory experiment . Additionally , difficulty cost related enlarge colored picture , graph chart result second rate production graphic ; thereby , hinder comprehension critical information . Furthermore , cost large print book exorbitant . According Jill Ischinger Director South Carolina Instructional Resource Center ( personal communication ) , IRC , cost providing set book student year approximately $ 2,237 . Finally , student choose education beyond high school severely limit reading option . Unlike primary secondary school Department Education purchase textbook book generally available large print , college student frequently lack resource pay costly , rare book . Moreover , previous study find read rate large print reader commensurate regular print reader . With current pressure high stake test great achievement , reader visual impairment increase risk fall behind school . Project Magnify model successful study sponsor Vanderbilt University Tennessee : Providing Access Visual Environment ( PAVE ) . PAVE provide comprehensive low vision service school age child throughout state Tennessee . The service provide PAVE include clinical low vision evaluation instruction use low vision aid . When PAVE initiate , Corn , Wall Bell research read rate student low vision read optical aid read rate non-visually impaired student . The study show student visual impairment continue lag behind peer read rate optical aid significantly reduce disparity ( 1999 ) . Our study design replicate portion pioneer study expand upon compare two dominant method help visually impaired student improve read skill : large print versus optical aid . Whereas PAVE compare reading rate optical aid user sight peer , Project Magnify seek determine benefit optical aid compare large print . In study design , student use large print alone control group . Students experimental group use optical aid prescribe specifically use . The main outcome measure read test conduct twelve month reading treatment . The difference read rate compare determine statistical significance . Since read rate normal numerical scale , parametric statistic use compare different reading rate . A Students T-test allow u compare difference read rate two group visually impaired student . To conduct study , twenty student currently serve South Carolina School Deaf Blind Division Outreach Services ( SCSDB ) refer inclusion study . The reading level student assess formal reading assessment . Students randomly assign two group . The large print reader control group receive instruction currently indicate Individual Education Plans ( IEPs ) . Students second group travel Feldberg Center Charleston clinical low vision evaluation . Furthermore , student receive monthly instruction use low vision aid throughout duration study . At study 's close , reading level student group assess . The change reading rate student compare determine whether significance difference exist optical aid large print .</detailed_description>
