	<brief_summary>A recent survey trend among member American Society Cataract Refractive Surgery determine laser situ keratomileusis ( LASIK ) lead surgical procedure photorefractive correction range −0 3 diopter ( D ) .1 The survey , however , show clear trend participate refractive surgeon toward surface ablation . Photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) first refractive surgery procedure approve perform use excimer laser . Several technique epithelial debridement try PRK-type surgery include mechanical debridement , laser transepithelial ablation , rotate brush , alcohol debridement . The Amadeus II microkeratome ( Advanced Medical Optics Inc , Irvine , CA , USA ) use creation LASIK flap upgradeable platform allow user perform mechanical separation corneal epithelium photorefractive treatment . With use device , corneal epithelium separate underlying stroma without previous preparation corneal surface alcohol . The separated epithelial sheet either remove replace operated cornea photoablation . This surgical procedure , call Epi-LASIK , represent advanced alternative surface ablation photorefractive procedure correction ametropia . The purpose study evaluate clinical visual outcome , heal rate , patient satisfaction perform surface ablation procedure use mechanical vs. alcohol separation epithelium .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject must candidate surface ablation procedure eye . ≥ 18 year age old . Myopia ≤ 6.00 D. Astigmatism ≤ 3.00 D. Manifest refraction spherical equivalent ( MRSE ) 6.00 D. Capable wear bandage contact lens . Willing able comply schedule visit study procedure . History ocular pathology . Very large pupil ( great 8mm diameter , infrared measurement ) . Thin cornea ( preoperatively calculate minimal residual bed &lt; 250 um ) . If patient fit group usual exclusionary criterion ( e.g . irregular astigmatism , asymmetric astigmatism , unstable refraction patient would typically consider LASIK candidate normal circumstance ) . History previous refractive surgery . Corneal irregularity potentially affect visual acuity : keratoconus , corneal dystrophy , corneal opacity . Participation ( current participation ) investigational drug device trial within previous 30 day prior start date trial . Intraocular conventional surgery within past three month intraocular laser surgery within one month operate eye . Use systemic topical drug know interfere visual performance . Pregnant nursing mother females childbearing potential practicing reliable medically acceptable method birth control Inability unwillingness subject give write informed consent .</criteria>
