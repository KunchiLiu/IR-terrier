	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Comparing Efficacy Foley Catheter Extraamniotic Saline Infusion Labor Induction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction labor indicate benefit either mother fetus outweighs continue pregnancy . Labor induction presence unripened cervix associate prolonged labor , chorioamnionitis , cesarean delivery . Numerous mechanical pharmacological method use cervical ripening . There limited number rigorous study compare efficacy various method . One common mechanical method cervical ripen placement Foley catheter 30 cc balloon inside cervix , without use oxytocin . The Foley balloon disrupt amniotic membrane surface cause release prostaglandin , natural chemical cervix , facilitate ripening process . Oxytocin use concurrently induction agent . Recently , modification method , extraamniotic saline infusion ( EASI ) become popular . The EASI method involve similar procedure include placement Foley catheter inside cervix ; addition , saline solution infuse catheter . This additional step think facilitate disruption amniotic membrane surface . Both method safe become standard treatment cervical ripening . However , publish trial far compare two method . The objective study compare efficacy safety Foley catheter oxytocin EASI oxytocin induction labor require cervical ripening . The study design single mask randomized trial .</detailed_description>
