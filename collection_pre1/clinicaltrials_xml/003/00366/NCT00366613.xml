	<brief_summary>This study involve use device seal capsular bag ( lens locate ) allow safe irrigation capsular bag sodium chloride irrigate capsular bag cataract surgery child . The purpose study determine use device , Perfect Capsule , along sodium chloride reduce development posterior capsule opacification ( PCO ) , possible complication cataract surgery . PCO cloud rear portion natural membrane capsule hold artificial lens . It require additional procedure correct problem . Sodium chloride usually use cataract surgery . It use irrigate capsular bag remove residual cell contribute development PCO . Perfect Capsule prevent sodium chloride touch part eye . The goal study determine irrigation sodium chloride low incidence PCO cataract surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation Use Sealed Capsule Irrigation With Sodium Chloride During Pediatric Cataract Surgery IOL Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dramatic advance occur treatment childhood cataract last 10 year . Intraocular lens implantation ( IOL ) universally accept standard care child beyond 2 year age . Despite advance cataract surgery child , PCO remain significant complication follow pediatric cataract surgery . In addition visually disturb , also induce amblyopia child treat early , irreversible visual change may occur . The young child , acute problem : PCO occur faster effect amblyopia pronounce . PCO generally require second surgical intervention , closure open make YAG capsulotomy common pediatric cataract surgery . Many time , child cooperative sit YAG capsulotomy , may also additional indication second surgery PCO . Removal residual epithelial cell one key factor avoid complication PCO . Several chemical suggest experimental setting remove kill residual lens epithelial cell . However , toxic ocular structure . Researchers search device help selectively kill lens epithelial cell . In long term , may help avoid PCO . Perfect Capsule : Perfect CapsuleTM ( Milvella ltd ) sterile single use ophthalmic instrument use perform seal irrigation capsular bag cataract surgery order facilitate irrigation capsule without irrigation fluid contact ocular structure . The device FDA approval via 510 ( k ) USA , CE mark Europe . No specific age limit list FDA approval . The device ( see fig ) consist 7 mm diameter head , 3 mm wide body 4 mm wide foot remain external eye . The head device comprise circumferential vacuum channel connect vacuum syringe via vacuum tube . The central portion head form plug irrigation/aspiration ( I/A ) channel ( body ) extend cornea allow fluid inject surface plug thus capsule . The device internal diameter 5 mm , mold medical grade silicone , package gamma sterilize . It easily roll folded pas standard corneal incision eye position anterior surface capsule use standard ophthalmic instrument . Concentrated Sodium Chloride : Concentrated Sodium Chloride injection , USP 23.4 % ( American Regent Laboratories , Inc. , Shirley , NY ) sterile , preservative free , nonpyrogenic solution Sodium Chloride water injection . Deionised water show lyse lens epithelial cell osmotic flow . Concentrated Sodium Chloride currently indicate intraocular use also expect affect corneal endothelium . Use Perfect Capsule help avoid contact Concentrated sodium Chloride endothelial cell . For purpose study , Concentrated Sodium Chloride injection color minimal fluorescein flow location visualize throughout procedure . Viscoelastic within anterior chamber provide additional protection corneal endothelium . SCI Perfect Capsule Concentrated Sodium Chloride : Perfect CapsuleTM allow empty capsular bag irrigate Concentrated Sodium Chloride . A previous study rabbit show toxic solution safely use SCI . It also show irrigation solution contain within capsular bag SCI perform human . Dr. Auffarth present summary two year Australian study result one year European multi-center clinical trial result perform SCI distilled water human ( At American Society Cataract Refractive Surgery meeting , 2005 ) . In 44 patient study , system could use without complication endothelial cell count corneal pachymetry different control eye . Visual acuity development 6-12 month period similar group . Retro-illumination photograph show high incidence fibrosis anterior capsule whiten control group compare SCI group . With currently available IOLs , PCO significant complication adult eye 1-2 year postoperative period . Long-term result need detect difference ( ) term PCO adult eye . In contrast , PCO significant problem pediatric eye . It occur much faster rate early postoperative period child 's eye compare adult 's eye . Younger child time cataract surgery , acute problem . Thus , possible see difference term PCO ( ) use Perfect Capsule child 's eye early postoperative period , 1 year postoperatively study . We aware publish result result present meet show use SCI distil water pediatric eye .</detailed_description>
