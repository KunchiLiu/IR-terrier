	<brief_summary>This study examine whether transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) brain use combination carbidopa-levodopa effective temporarily improve speed hand movement stoke patient TMS alone . In TMS , wire coil hold patient 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The effect TMS muscle detect small metal disk electrode tap skin arm leg . Carbidopa-levodopa medication usually use treat Parkinson 's disease , may improve effect theta burst stimulation . Two kind TMS use study . In single-pulse TMS one two pulse deliver time order measure brain activity moment . In repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) , series pulse give short burst , temporarily alter brain activity . The type rTMS use study call theta burst stimulation . Healthy normal volunteer people stroke 6 month enter study may eligible participate . All candidate must 18 90 year age . Stroke patient must significant hand weakness make moderate good recovery must able move either thumb wrist affect hand reasonably well . Normal volunteer must right-handed . Participants complete test study four main session schedule least week apart five short follow-up session . At main session , participant take either carbidopa-levodopa tablet placebo ( look-alike inactive substance ) . Stroke patient arm hand function assess use two test . One require insert pegs hole ; include writing , lift various object , perform activity like turn page , feed stack checker . All subject complete questionnaire regard mood alertness perform test thumb wrist movement . For test , small electrical stimulus applied side hand subject must respond stimulus quickly possible make thumb wrist movement . This repeat several time 3 minute . A second test follow subject move thumb wrist response beep speaker . This test repeat several time 8 minute . Some measurement take use single-pulse TMS beginning , middle end test . In two four session , theta burst stimulation apply single-pulse TMS two session , sham theta burst stimulation apply . Five follow-up session schedule one day main session one week follow final one . In session , subject perform abbreviate form thumb movement test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Theta Burst Stimulation ( TBS ) type sub-threshold repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) effect excitability human motor cortex outlast stimulation hour . TBS also affect performance motor task 30 minute stimulation healthy subject , improve reaction time ( increase corticospinal excitability ) patient chronic stroke ( Talelli 2005 ) . The advantage TBS non-invasive brain stimulation strategy low intensity , short duration application long lasting effect . The spectrum behavioral effect investigate far modest . Evidence accumulate dopaminergic agent enhance synaptic plasticity ( Otani 1998 ) improve motor train healthy human ( Meintzchel 2005 ) . After stroke , Carbidopa-Levodopa also enhance response physiotherapy motor learning ( Scheidtmann 2001 , Floel 2005 ) . This protocol aim test hypothesis Carbidopa-Levodopa may enhance beneficial effect TBS reaction time patient chronic stroke . STUDY POPULATION : We plan investigate 18 patient motor impairment 6 month ischemic stroke , 10 healthy volunteer . Approval seek total 28 patient 30 healthy volunteer account possible dropout pilot experiment ( describe ) . DESIGN : Each subject ask participate 4 session , least week apart . The experiment test simple reaction time thumb wrist paretic hand 7 minute either genuine sham TBS . This followed measure motor learning , use well-characterized paradigm ( Muellbacher 2001 ) , involve optimize externally pace ballistic thumb ( wrist ) movement , TMS measurement corticospinal excitability . Performance learn task assess ( TMS measure make ) 2 hour , 1 day 1 week follow training session . The experimental design four session 2x2 TBS/sham Carbidopa-Levodopa/placebo . For TBS , patient give 3 minute either genuine sham TBS hand representation motor cortex ( Huang 2005 ) . For Carbidopa-Levodopa/placebo , identical preparation NIH pharmacy give 1 hour beforehand . TBS previously use 72 healthy subject ( 7 study ) Europe 10 patient chronic stroke ( 2 study ) Lead Associate Investigator 's lab London . No side effect seizures report . Ten normal volunteer study first optimize experimental setting . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome measure reaction time . Improvement peak acceleration learn task constitute secondary measure . We expect see improved reaction time genuine TBS ( vs. sham ) look interaction whereby Carbidopa-Levodopa may enhance effect ( vs. placebo ) . This would suggest synergy dopaminergic modulation TBS may show promise produce clinical gain stroke .</detailed_description>
