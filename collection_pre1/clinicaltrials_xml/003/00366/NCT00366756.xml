	<brief_summary>This study involve use VisionQuest 20/20 new software program test visual acuity child . The purpose study compare result VisionQuest 20/20 two way measure visual acuity . The two test standard eye exam ophthalmologist electronic visual acuity ( EVA ) testing , computerize version standard eye test . It important identify vision problem child early possible . These problem include amblyopia ( `` lazy eye , '' reduce vision due lack development visual area brain ) , strabismus ( eye align correctly due eye muscle problem ) , refractive error ( need glass see close far away ) . Early identification vision problem allow treat earlier make likely vision improve . VisionQuest 20/20 easily distribute school , easy child vision screener use . The test perform volunteer instead ophthalmologist .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Assessing visual acuity represent one sensitive technique detection eye abnormality child . Vision disorder fourth common disability USA prevalent handicap condition childhood . Ocular condition , undetected untreated , substantial long-term implication quality life child family place burden public health resource . Important cause visual impairment child include amblyopia , strabismus significant refractive error . Children condition may benefit early detection allow treatment . Early detection treatment key successful management child visual disorder . If detect childhood , treatment amblyopia effective inexpensive . Although amblyopia treatable disorder detect childhood brain 's `` critical period '' vision development , every year problem go undetected untreated thousand US child result permanent visual disability individual hundred million dollar annual economic loss society . Furthermore , less serious type childhood vision problem , refractive error , may contribute academic underperformance identify childhood . What age , venue , methodology best perform vision screening full eye examination indicate remains determine . , Nevertheless , nearly universal agreement exist among U.S. government agency , health expert , educator , charitable vision organization child screen visual disorder , even asymptomatic . To date , combination scientific , logistical , economic , legislative shortcoming prevent vision screen goal meet many U.S. child . The ideal vision screen method accurate ( sensitive specific clinically significant visual problem amenable treatment ) , standardize , easy administer interpret little training , cost effective , universally available child , capable collect data ensure medical follow-up receive need well collect epidemiological information monitor success program year year . The Amblyopia Foundation America ( AFA ) conceptualize automate computer software assess vision child `` play '' video game could potentially meet requirement ideal vision screen system child old enough cooperate . Young child increasingly familiar computer videogames , oftentimes sophisticated use parent . Vision screen software easy distribute via CDs internet . Computers readily available virtually school cost computer technology continue decline even performance improves . Computer software application allow standardization logic protocols vision screening videogame format allow automate test . Automated test eliminates need large scale training certification vision screen proctor instead allow vision screening perform untrained lay volunteer personnel already available school . Finally , since response child test inputted directly computer , result may print instantaneously end testing . Computer data may warehouse locally offsite via internet help coordinate medical follow-up child identify risk , monitor success program , facilitate epidemiological analysis vision disorder . Prototype VisionQuest 20/20 software currently perform standardize visual acuity assessment eye stereopsis test child `` plays '' 2-3 minute video game . A pilot study ( O'Neil J.W. , et al 2005 unpublished ) suggest lay screener use early version prototype vision screen software laptop computer achieve similar positive negative predictive value result certify ophthalmic technician use professional grade M &amp; S vision tester . Positive predictive value clinically significant visual disorder 54 % M &amp; S 52 % VisionQuest 20/20 respectively . Negative predictive value identical 97 % screen method . VisionQuest 20/20 appear potential use vision screener schoolchildren may allow child reach manual vision screen method rely lay personnel already available school rather certify vision screener eye professional perform screening . Additional benefit include use computer already available school potential simplify vision screen logistics reduce cost . Independent validity test essential initiate large scale community vision screen new vision screening software . The primary aim current study validate VisionQuest 20/20 screen software assess ability screen threshold visual acuity compare exact visual acuity obtain EVA tester use ETDRS optotypes . The secondary aim current study evaluate ability VisionQuest 20/20 software detect presence absence clinically significant vision disorder child compare professional eye examination pediatric ophthalmologist .</detailed_description>
