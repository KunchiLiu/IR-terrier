	<detailed_description>Ketorolac tromethamine nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , administer systemically , demonstrate analgesic , anti-inflammatory , anti-pyretic activity . The mechanism action think due ability inhibit prostaglandin biosynthesis ( cyclo-oxigenase inhibitor ) . However , leave lipoxygenase pathway free generate leukotrienes . This pharmacodynamic activity speculate reason NSAIDs produce less ocular side effect corticosteroid . It widely use ophthalmology . In 1987 , Flach1 publish effectiveness treatment aphakic pseudophakic macular edema . Its efficacy cataract surgery shown2 compare topical steroid extra-capsular cataract extraction3,4,5 phacoemulsification6,7 . It use analgesic radial keratotomy ( RK ) 8,9 , photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) 10 laser situ keratomileusis ( LASIK ) 11 The purpose study compare effectiveness NSAID ketorolac tromethamine ophthalmic solution 0.4 % steroid loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.5 % prevent anterior segment inflammation routine cataract surgery .</detailed_description>
