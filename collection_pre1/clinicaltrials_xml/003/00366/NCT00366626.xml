	<brief_title>Effectiveness Naltrexone Versus Placebo Reduce Craving Alcohol With Evaluation Genetic Variability .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 300 non-treatment seek alcoholic recruit advertisement pay participation . They assess , subtyped mu-opiate receptor catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) allelic variant 88 individual ( 44 common AA gene 44 either AG GG gene ) randomly assign take either naltrexone ( 50 mg/day ) match placebo 7 day . Since val meet allele catechol-O-methyltransferase ( COMT ) gene present 50 % population equally distribute urn randomization opiate allele treatment group . After 5 day natural drink one day abstinence , subject undergo alcohol cue-induced brain activity scan use well-established fMRI technique Day 6 study drug . The following day subject receive standard dose ( gender weight correct ) alcohol evaluate alcohol reactivity ( stimulation , sedation , intoxication , crave ) 40 minute . They allow consume 8 mini-drinks 2-hour period . Afterwards subject receive educational/motivational counseling regard alcohol use effect . Referral treatment offer .</detailed_description>
