	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Adult Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells Treat Steroid Refractory Acute Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 6300 patient receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant United States year ( IBMTR , 2003 ) . Nearly 50 % ( approximately 3,150 ) patient develop acute GVHD ( Goker et al ) . A fraction patient ( approximately 870 ) progress severe stage disease , Grades III-IV . It estimate nearly 82 % patient severe acute GVHD steroid refractory ( Przepiorka et al. , 1995 ) , 50 % steroid-refractory patient wll respond secondary tertiary treatment ( Greinix et al. , 2000 ) . Thus , roughly 350 patient year face tremendous odds survival . In addition , patient initially respond secondary tertiary treatment high risk die within first year ( Remberger et al. , 2001 ; Anasetti et al. , 1994 ) . Development new therapeutic agent strategy rescue patient steroid refractory , acute GVHD would provide significant benefit area unmet medical need . Patients receive standard care addition adult mesenchymal stem cell placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects must 6 month 70 year age , inclusive Subjects fail respond steroid treatment : Failure respond steroid treatment define grade BD ( IBMTR grade ) acute GVHD show : No improvement 3 day duration great 2 week receive treatment Methylprednisolone ( great equal 1 mg/kg/day ) equivalent . Subjects must treat within 4 day randomization . In urgent situation 2nd line therapy may start 24 hour prior randomization , Prochymal must initiate within follow 3 day . Subjects receive increase steroid dose treatment prior randomization eligible enrollment . An increase steroid dose consider second line therapy . Subjects must adequate renal function define : Calculated Creatinine Clearance &gt; 30mL/min use Cockroft Gault equation For pediatric patient : Schwartz equation : ( Patient population : infant 1 week old adolescence ( &lt; 18 year old ) Subjects woman childbearing potential , must nonpregnant , breastfeed , use adequate contraception . Male subject must use adequate contraception Subject must minimum Karnofsky Performance Level least 30 time study entry Subject ( legal representative appropriate ) must capable provide write informed consent .
