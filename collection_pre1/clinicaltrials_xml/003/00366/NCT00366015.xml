	<brief_summary>This study combine coronary stenting minimally invasive robotic coronary bypass surgery , accomplish use da Vinci robot , restore blood flow occlude coronary artery . Two previously approve commonly perform procedure use treat coronary artery disease ( coronary stenting robotic bypass surgery ) combine hybrid surgery specialty build operating room . Patients low risk coronary lesion undergo cardiac hybrid revascularization use stenting LIMA LAD robotic bypass concomitantly . Patients ' postoperative bleeding rate , angiographs complication free rate record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) lead cause death United States become common population age ( American Heart Association , 2003 ) . The symptom CAD may become perceptible condition advance severe serious stage , might explain large mortality morbidity rate associate heart disease . At point many procedure available treat CAD aim improve myocardial blood flow , stop angina , increase exercise ability ultimately free patient medication improve quality life . Medications use reduce blood pressure relieve strain heart . Cardiologists use angioplasty , compress plaque deposit , stenting , small wire mesh tube insert diseased artery revascularize heart muscle . On-pump coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) redirect blood flow around clog vessel heart commonly use cardiac surgeon treat CAD proven yield low restenosis rate revascularization technique ( Cisowski , 2002 ) . CABG effective yet painful traumatic intervention . The desire discover less distressing approach coronary artery revascularization lead fairly new cardiac hybrid procedure involve stenting follow minimally invasive leave internal mammary artery ( LIMA ) leave anterior descend artery ( LAD ) bypass graft ( Amodeo , 2002 ) . The hybrid procedure revascularization carry low morbidity on-pump CABG also quickly gain acceptance surgical community ( de Canniere et al , 2001 ) . The two procedure hybrid revascularization currently perform within 24 48 hour little collaboration cardiac surgeon cardiologist . This study asses efficacy safety cardiac hybrid surgery combine stenting robotic LIMA LAD graft procedure specialty build operating room . Long term use antiplatelet inhibitor , clopidogrel , take patient study , proven significantly reduce risk adverse ischemic event percutaneous coronary intervention ( Steinhubl , 2002 ) . In addition , application Bivalirudin ( Direct Thrombin Inhibitor ) assess integrate myocardial revascularization scenario . The many attractive aspect robotic hybrid bypass include avoidance procedural phase ( arrested heart , blood transfusion , median sternotomy cardiopulmonary bypass ) on-pump CABG . Robotic LIMA LAD bypass stenting procedure allow cardiac surgeon cardiologist work together help patient obtain safe effective coronary artery revascularization .</detailed_description>
