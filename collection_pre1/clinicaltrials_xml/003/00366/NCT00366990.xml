	<brief_title>Low Sodium Diet Behavioral Intervention Reversing Arterial Stiffening Overweight Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CVD include disease affect heart blood vessel . Arterial stiffness , arteries harden become less flexible , increase risk develop CVD . Arterial stiffness increase age certain disease state , include high blood pressure , diabetes , obesity . Young adult obese prematurely place risk develop arterial stiffness CVD . Physical activity weight loss may reverse arterial stiffness individual . Reducing sodium intake , proven decrease blood pressure , may also improve blood vessel function arterial stiffness . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness low sodium diet behavioral weight loss intervention reduce arterial stiffness young , moderately overweight individual . Participants first attend baseline study visit , time blood collect , height , weight , waist circumference , blood pressure measure . Questionnaires assess medical history , physical activity level , dietary habit complete . An ultrasound use evaluate blood vessel function arterial stiffness . All participant take part 12-month behavioral dietary intervention . The intervention emphasize increase physical activity decrease caloric intake modify lifestyle choice , physical social environment , attitude toward food exercise . Participants randomly assign follow either low sodium diet normal sodium diet . During Months 1 4 , participant attend weekly study visit group counsel session ; Months 4 8 , study visit occur every two week ; Months 8 12 , occur month . At study visit , weight , waist circumference , blood pressure also measure . If necessary , individual counseling session schedule . Participants also document daily physical activity caloric intake diary . Baseline evaluation repeat Months 6 , 12 , 24 .</detailed_description>
