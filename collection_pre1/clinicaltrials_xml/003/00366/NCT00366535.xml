	<brief_summary>This study examine safety effectiveness experimental drug , neurotropin , prevent ease pain associate fibromyalgia . A disorder primarily affect woman , fibromyalgia cause widespread ache stiffness muscle . Neurotropin use Japan many year treat various chronic painful condition , include fibromyalgia . Women fibromyalgia treat unsuccessfully standard therapy may eligible study . Patients must history widespread pain half day three month enter study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , questionnaire electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Participants take usual medication fibromyalgia addition either neurotropin placebo ( look-alike medicine active ingredient ) . At 6 week 12 week study , return NIH Clinical Center evaluation sensitivity pain level physical capability . After 12 week , study subject `` cross-over '' medication ; , patient take neurotropin first 12 week study take placebo next 12 week , vice-versa . Again , 6 12 week , patient return evaluation . Participants blood urine test six time study complete questionnaire week pain , symptom , activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia relatively common disorder , occur predominantly woman , characterize widespread ache stiffness muscle . Although numerous study fibromyalgia , etiology remain unclear , generally believe central pain processing abnormality involve . Neurotropin , non-protein extract inflame cutaneous tissue rabbit inoculate vaccinia virus , use extensively Japan many year treat variety chronic painful condition , include fibromyalgia . This present protocol double blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study design examine clinical efficacy Neurotropin treat woman ( neither pregnant lactate ) suffer fibromyalgia without evidence cause complaint pain . Patients must meet American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) diagnostic criterion fibromyalgia must agree maintain stable therapeutic regimen throughout 25-week study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects draw cohort wellcharacterized female fibromyalgia patient care Dr. Daniel . J. Clauw Georgetown University . All patient must continue meet criterion establish ACR diagnosis fibromyalgia , must treat unsuccessfully current standard therapeutic regimen . The criterion ( A ) history widespread pain ( quadrant back ) half day prior three month ( B ) require number,11 , tender point 18 test site ( indicated Figure 1 ) , determine initial physical examination ( see ) . They must give informed consent participate study . It anticipate almost patient resident Washington , D.C. area able travel NIH necessary preliminary study subsequent require evaluation . To admit study , patient must willing continue use present medication ( include antidepressant ) form care relate control fibromyalgia symptom course study . The average score FIQ patient see tertiary care setting 50 ( 100 maximum , high score indicate great impairment health ) include patient FIQ score great 30 initial evaluation . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Pregnant lactate woman exclude bodily change would occur study . As indicated , pregnancy test perform woman childbearing age ( age 55 ) . The combination widespread musculoskeletal pain , high tender point count , nonrestorative sleep usually sufficient criterion diagnosis fibromyalgia patient refer study well characterize Fibromyalgia Clinic Georgetown University refer physician . We , however , history , physical examination , screen laboratory study examination patient medical record confirm absence evidence peripheral neuropathy , entrapment syndrome , neurologic disorder metabolic/endocrine disorder , untreated hypothyroidism , well rheumatoid disorder might confuse fibromyalgia confound study . Patients abnormal screen test result traumatic nontraumatic disorder pain may attribute . Also , patient positive HIV result exclude . Subjects obviously impaired mental capacity precludes inform consent ability provide adequate selfratings exclude .</criteria>
