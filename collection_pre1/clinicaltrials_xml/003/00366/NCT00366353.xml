	<brief_summary>An important part decide patient ready breathe tube remove person breathe without machine breath breathe tube still place . We call spontaneous breathe trial . Commonly , patient breathe tube , give medication keep sedate comfortable breathe bother . These medicine often stop spontaneous breathe trial awake test . There sign doctor look spontaneous breathe trial suggest patient might ready breathe trial come . Signs like fast breathing , small breath , fast heart rate , look anxious usual may mean patient ready come ventilator . However , someone give sedation medicine entire time breathe tube woken , may naturally get anxious . They may show sign someone fail breathe test , case sign anxious.Doctors may mistake sign fail breathe test may pull breathe tube even though patient really ready come . We wish try find patient well spontaneous breathing trial continue sedative medicine treat anxiety well medicine stop test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All intubate patient care Medical Intensive Care Unit ( MICU ) team study period evaluate . After 24 hour mechanical ventilation , patient meet exclusionary criterion consider entrance trial . We attempt obtain consent soon 24 hour period fulfil , even patient ready extubation point . This maximize success rate obtain consent without delay SBT patient clinically ready . Given nature protocol , expect inform consent primarily obtain patient 's family member POA . For patient regain competency , re-consented permission use data collect . Once patient consent , follow daily study investigator . When order write MICU team patient undergo SBT , patient 's level consciousness evaluate nursing staff use RASS . If patient 's score &lt; ( -2 ) , notify study investigator . The patient randomize seal envelope one two study group . Group 1 immediately undergo SBT still sedate . Group 2 sedation hold . Once RASS score 0 high follow simple command ( hold two finger command ) , initiate SBT . The standard duration SBT protocol 2 hour . The duration SBT may shorter discretion ICU attend physician . Additionally , standard ventilator setting SBT 10 cm Pressure Support 5 cm PEEP ( positive expiratory pressure ) . This may vary attend 's preference though encourage use standard setting study unless clear need deviate protocol . This limit confound impact differing level Pressure Support may parameters tracked . Patients felt fail SBt place back fill ventilator support point direct MICU team . Given lack objective criterion define failure SBT , clear criterion define decision patient fail SBT determine attend physician . Nursing staff provide documentation form ( Data sheet 1 ) ask annotate heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate , tidal volume , oxygen saturation , RASS score 0 , 15 , 30 , 60 minute conclusion SBT.They inserviced protocol prior start study . The study investigator collect demographic information record Data sheet 2 . In addition primary endpoint ( change cardiopulmonary parameter RASS collect nursing staff ) , secondary endpoint include outcome first SBT ( pas fail ) , time randomization extubation , outcome first extubation ( Data sheet 1 ) . As state earlier , clearly define cut-off value monitor variable define failure SBT .</detailed_description>
