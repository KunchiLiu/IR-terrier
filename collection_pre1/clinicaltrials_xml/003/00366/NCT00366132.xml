	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study compare safety effectiveness shockwave treatment combine standard-of-care treatment , standard-of-care treatment alone induce heal chronic plantar foot ulcer subject diabetes mellitus . For purpose study , definition plantar foot ulcer wind open sore involve plantar ( bottom ) aspect foot , definition chronic duration 6 week great lack response treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety &amp; Efficacy Study Use Extracorporeal Shockwaves Treatment Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic foot complication common cause nontraumatic low extremity amputation industrialize world . The risk low extremity amputation range 15 46 time higher diabetic person diabetes mellitus . Furthermore , foot complication frequent reason hospitalization patient diabetes , account 25 percent diabetic admission United States Great Britain . The vast majority diabetic foot complication result amputation begin formation skin ulcer . Early detection appropriate treatment ulcer may prevent 85 percent amputation . ( Armstrong ) The primary goal treatment diabetic foot ulcer obtain wound closure . Rest , elevation affect foot , relief pressure basic treatment usually initiate patient first present foot ulcer . A postoperative shoe another type pressure-relieving footwear also often prescribe . Crutches wheelchair might also recommend totally off-load pressure foot . Necrotic tissue debrided allow full visualization extent ulcer , allow detect underlying abscess sinus , support healing . Wet-to-wet dressing use provide warm , moist environment protect external contamination conducive wound healing . Additional option include numerous topical medication gel , special dressing , include semipermeable film , foam , hydrocolloid , calcium alginate swab . When conservative treatment fail , another recently develop nonoperative option available . The genetically engineer platelet-derived growth factor becaplermin ( Regranex Gel , OMJ Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ) approve use neuropathic diabetic foot ulcer expedite heal . Growth factor stimulate chemotaxis mitogenesis neutrophil , fibroblast , monocyte , well component form cellular basis wound healing . When nonoperative treatment fail , skin graft often require achieve wound closure . In addition autologous donor tissue graft procedure , bioengineered skin ( Apligraf , Organogenesis , P950032/S016 ) human dermis ( Dermagraft , Smith &amp; Nephew , P000036 ) new type biologically active implant approve diabetic foot ulcer derive fibroblast neonatal foreskin . These bioengineered product enhance heal act delivery system growth factor extracellular matrix component activity live human fibroblast contain dermal element . ( Frykberg ) Despite variety modality available treat diabetic foot ulcer , US Center Disease Control report age-adjusted low extremity amputation rate person diabetes 5.5 per 1,000 person diabetes , 28 time person without diabetes . ESWT Soft Tissue Indications The use extracorporeal shock wave clinical application introduce United States 20 year ago ; first indication use approve FDA treatment renal calculus ( kideny stone ) . Since time , clinical application extracorporeal shock wave therapy ( ESWT ) expand include treatment chronic proximal plantar fasciitis ( P990086 , HealthTronics OssaTron ; P000048 , Dornier EPOS Ultra ; P040026 , Orthospec Extracorporeal Shock Wave Device ; P040039 , Orthometrix Orbasone Pain Relief System ) chronic lateral epicondylitis ( P990086/S003 , HealthTronics OssaTron ; P010039 , Siemens Sonocur Basic ) . In addition , numerous report clinical pre-clinical literature shockwave therapy use treat orthopedic condition fracture non-unions , femoral head necrosis , non-orthopedic condition related tissue healing . Treatment extracorporeal shock wave show associated neovascularization animal model . Further , since several shockwave system approve PMA process treatment chronic proximal plantar fasciitis chronic lateral epicondylitis , large amount data regard safety device treat soft tissue . The research do Meirer et al . ( 2005 ) Nishida et al . ( 2004 ) suggest local delivery shockwave therapy result increase release growth factor improve circulation wound . Because promise association ESWT tissue healing , favorable risk / benefit profile device approve treatment soft tissue indication , European clinical experience ESWT wound healing , hypothesize extracorporeal shock wave treatment ( ESWT ) could beneficial treat diabetic foot ulcer . Therefore , IDE describe clinical study design determine safety effectiveness DermaGold® ESW System use induce heal chronic plantar foot ulcer patient diabetic foot ulcer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis single chronic plantar foot ulcer persist minimum 6 week duration History Type 2 diabetes mellitus ; ( track/ask insulin dependent ) Capable wound care home ; The ulcer measure &gt; 1 cm &lt; 4 cm dimension The ulcer Stage 1 2A accord classification system describe Lavery et al . Stage 1 – superficial wound epidemis epidermis dermis penetrate tendon , capsule bone . Stage 2A – Clean wound penetrate tendon capsule . Palpable pedal pulse affect leg OR peripheral vascular disease evaluation demonstrate acceptable blood supply affect foot ; Subjects age &gt; 18 year ; The Investigator complete medical history physical examination assure subject meet study enrollment criterion ; The subject willing able read , understand sign study specific informed consent form ; The subject agree comply study protocol requirement , include shockwave procedure , selfcare wound ( e.g. , wet wet dressing , orthotics ) follow visit requirement . Pregnancy Type I diabetes Plantar foot ulcer extend /or involves bone joint ; Ulcers present foot Multiple ulcer foot Clinical evidence cellulitis ulcer site surround area ; Ulcers purulent exudate malodorous exudate visual examination Diagnosis chronic plantar foot ulcer persist &gt; 1 year . Peripheral vascular disease per study enrollment workup require vascular surgery intervention . ABI ( Ankle Brachial Index ) &lt; 0.6 Ulcer debridement anesthesia OR require within 2 week observation phase , Lower extremity revascularization procedure ( e.g . PTA , graft , etc . ) within eight ( 8 ) week study screen visit . Uncorrected biomechanical abnormality cause contribute affect low extremity ulcer ; ( e.g . tight Achilles tendon , hammer toe , Charcot foot etc . ) Surgical procedure correct biomechanical abnormities ( e.g. , lengthen Achilles tendon . correction hammer toe , Charcot foot correction ) within eight ( 8 ) week study screen visit ; Deep vein thrombosis within 6 month study screen visit ; Clinical evidence lymphadema ; Active previous ( within 60 day prior study screen visit ) chemotherapy ; Treatment plantar foot ulcer growth factor , prostaglandin therapy vasodilator therapy 2 week observation phase . Subject steroid therapy Sickle cell anemia Infection Human Immunodeficiency Virus Immunodeficiency disorder Severe protein malnutrition – serum albumin &lt; 2.0g/dl Severe anemia Hgb &lt; 7 g/dl ( male ) &lt; 6.5 ( female ) Recent treatment ( within 60 day prior study screen visit ) immunosuppresants , radiation , biologically active cellular / acellular product ; Current history substance abuse . Physical mental disability geographical concern ( residence within reasonable travel distance ) would hamper compliance require study visit ; Current participation another clinical investigation medical device drug , recent participation study within 30 day prior study enrollment ; The Investigator believe subject unwilling unable comply study protocol requirement , include shock wave treatment procedure , standardofcare selfcare requirement , studyrelated follow visit requirement .</criteria>
