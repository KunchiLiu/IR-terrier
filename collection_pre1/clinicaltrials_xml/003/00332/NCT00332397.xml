	<brief_title>The Efficacy Three Different Limus Agent-Eluting Stents Prevent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery reblockage remain still drawback percutaneous coronary intervention even era drug-eluting stent ( DES ) . DESs work principle consist delivery control amount antiproliferative agent local level , result suppression neontimal proliferation , main cause lumen re-narrowing stent implantation.At present , several DES platform develop evaluated clinical use . They differ regard stent type , anti-proliferative drug , presence polymer employ drug storage modification drug-release kinetics well type polymer use purpose . Most DES platform use agent `` limus family '' . Although majority DESs employ polymer coat control drug storage release , view increase safety efficacy associate long-term presence polymer strong interest recently show development DES platform require permanent polymer . Trials ACTION JUPITER II demonstrate DESs associate expect improved outcome . On hand , successful DESs equally effective reduction restenosis . Thus , rapamycin-eluting stent ( Cypher stent ) associate low angiographic clinical restenosis rate paclitaxel-eluting stent ( Taxus stent ) . Similarly , Cypher stents superior Endeavor stent regard primary end point late luminal loss recent ENDEAVOR III trial . Meanwhile , on-site rapamycin-coated stent ( ISAR stent ) equivalent antiproliferative efficacy Taxus stents ISAR-TEST trial . However , none study evaluate angiographic restenosis primary endpoint direct comparison 3 DES -Cypher , Endeavor ISAR stent , perform . The Cypher stent stainless steel stent coat sirolimus use permanent polymer Endeavor stent cobalt alloy base stent coat zotarolimus also use permanent polymer drug-storage release . The ISAR stent rough surface stainless steel stent coat sirolimus cath lab without require permanent polymeric coating .</detailed_description>
