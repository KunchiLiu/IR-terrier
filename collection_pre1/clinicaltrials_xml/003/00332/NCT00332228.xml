Increased commitment language strength part SO monitor contribute independently outcome identify patient , control patient level commitment . A critical objective current proposal improve retention , particularly initial week treatment . Preliminary work new depot formulation naltrexone conduct ( Comer et al , 1999 , unpublished data ) , show well tolerate provide therapeutic blood level blockade opiate effect four week single injection .
