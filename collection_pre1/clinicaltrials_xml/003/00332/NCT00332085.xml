	<brief_title>Pilot Trial Chromium-Metformin Combination Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chromium widely market use diabetes use dietary supplement approximately 10 million US consumer , second calcium supplementation . Limited scientific research support potential chromium beneficial diabetes improve blood sugar control insulin sensitivity , yet many study design flaws relevance research US population question . Research use complementary &amp; alternative medicine ( CAM ) suggest many 40 % use CAM combination conventional medicine . Research perform Bastyr Center Natural Health suggest 69 % patient get chromium part treatment 45 % oral medication blood sugar control . Metformin commonly prescribe oral medication diabetes world . The combination chromium metformin never study clinical trial despite frequent use combination . Additionally , research suggest chromium metformin share least one mechanism action lead question possible interaction - favorable unfavorable - result combination . Type 2 diabetes remain sixth lead cause death US . Despite evolve technology development new medication , epidemiological data show 37 % patient good glycemic control define American Diabetes Association . Recent large trial ( UKPDS ) suggest improvement blood sugar control lead favorable outcome . Human research suggest chromium improve insulin receptor sensitivity lead blood sugar reduction . Research also show blood level chromium low people type 2 diabetes diabetic patient lose chromium urine people without diabetes . This pilot trial recruit type 2 diabetic subject already metformin treat chromium picolinate 8 week . The result trial provide vital preliminary data include safety size effect direct future , large study .</detailed_description>
