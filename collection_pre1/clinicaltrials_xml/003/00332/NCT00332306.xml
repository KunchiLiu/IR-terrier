	<brief_summary>Protocol Summary Title : Evaluation safety efficacy two different daily anti-retroviral treatment regimen along anti-tuberculosis treatment patient HIV-1 tuberculosis - Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Phase : Phase III trial Population : 180 HIV-1 positive patient tuberculosis Number Sites : Four . 1 . Tuberculosis Research Centre , Chennai 2 . Government Medical College , Vellore 3 . Government Hospital Thoracic Medicine , Tambaram 4 . Government Rajaji Hospital , Madurai Study Duration : 26 month include 24 month ART . Study Objectives : Primary Objective To compare efficacy safety two different once-daily anti-retroviral treatment regimen ( along standard anti-tuberculosis treatment ) patient HIV-1 tuberculosis , use virologic end point . Secondary Objective To compare efficacy antiretroviral treatment give partial supervision unsupervised treatment ( month supply ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Two Once Daily Anti Retroviral Treatment Regimens Along With Anti-tuberculosis Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Description Agent Intervention : The study intervention start patient HIV tuberculosis anti-retroviral treatment along continuation phase anti-tuberculosis treatment ( ATT ) ie completion first two month treatment . The anti-TB regimen use trial 2EHRZ3/4RH3 . Two different once-daily regimen compare efficacy adverse event profile , namely ddI + 3TC + NVP versus ddI + 3TC + EFZ . The primary aim study outcome patient treat ART ATT 6 month ( 24 week ART ) . A secondary objective compare utility partially supervise directly observe treatment unsupervised administration anti-retroviral drug . Patients HIV-1 infection active tuberculosis ( pulmonary extrapulmonary ) start four-drug intermittent short-course anti-TB regimen recruitment trial . They randomize end intensive phase ATT receive either ART regimens outcome measure end 6 month . During phase , ATT ART give supervision three time week . Patients viral load &lt; 400 copies/ml ( favourable outcome ) time point randomize receive ART either partial observation treatment ( three time week ) monthly supply ( unsupervised administration ) final outcome measure end 24 month ART . The study provide information comparative efficacy two regimen give anti-TB treatment well add advantage direct observation treatment may provide .</detailed_description>
