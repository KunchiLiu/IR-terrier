	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 ( ) clinical trial design dose-blinded , block-randomized , multi-center study select dosage schedule rF1V vaccine study base immune response Day 210 . Additional immunogenicity safety/reactogenicity data collect Day 540 . Selection dosage schedule base GMCs seroconversion rate anti-F1 , anti-V anti-rF1V antibody titer . Approximately 400 healthy adult volunteer enrol ( 100 per group ) study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To select dosage schedule rF1V vaccine study base immune response F1 V antigens Day 210 . Secondary Objectives : 1 ) To assess safety three injection rF1V vaccine administer IM two dosage level . 2 ) To assess onset duration humoral immune response F1 V antigens . 3 ) To assess humoral immune response rF1V antigen . 4 ) To collect store blood sample future plague relate research . Exploratory Objectives : To assess additional humoral immune response rF1V vaccine antigen .</detailed_description>

History allergy kanamycin aminoglycosides ( e.g. , gentamicin , tobramycin , amikacin ) 4 . Positive prescreening human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) ; hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) hepatitis B surface antigen ( HbsAg ) . 5 . A history immunodeficiency chronic illness require continuous frequent medical intervention , acute/chronic untreated condition , autoimmune disease use immunosuppressive medication . 6 . Chronic , severe recurrent joint pain ( 4 occurrence per year ) arthritis type . 7 . A positive result urine drug screen test common substance abuse amphetamine , barbiturate , benzodiazepine , cocaine , opiates cannabinoids . 8 . A previous diagnosis serious psychiatric disorder . For purpose , serious psychiatric disorder define illness require hospitalization within previous 12 month ; routine administration one medication control anxiety , mood sleep disorder ; history suicide attempt . 9 . Receipt blood product immune globulin previous 6 month . 10 . Receipt investigational vaccine previous 6 month 11 . Donation blood within 56 day prior first vaccination time prior Day 210 visit . 12 . Receipt investigational drug therapy within 30 day first dose rF1V intent receive investigational drug therapy postvaccination Day 540 visit . 13 . A clinically significant abnormality ECG . 14 . A body mass index &gt; equal 35 kg/m2 15 . Acute illness , evidence significant active infection systemic disease time enrollment opinion Investigator would place volunteer unacceptable risk injury . 16 . Personal history multiple sclerosis , since immune system stimulation may exacerbate disorder . 17 . Occupational responsibility would prevent completion participation study . 18 . Licensed vaccine exclusionary give least 2 week immunization ( live vaccine , 60 day immunization ) avoid potential confusion adverse reaction . 19 . Screening laboratory value within acceptable range . 20 . A history anaphylaxis serious adverse reaction vaccine . 21 . The female volunteer pregnant 22 . Receipt therapy immunosuppressive agent , include highdose systemic corticosteroid ( i.e. , prednisoneequivalent dose &gt; equal 20 mg/day ) , within 3 month prior study .</criteria>
