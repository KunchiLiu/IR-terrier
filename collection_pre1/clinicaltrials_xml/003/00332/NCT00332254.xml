	<brief_summary>Individuals severe knee injury increase risk develop arthritis knee much early age would otherwise expect . The swell inflammation occur injury believe responsible cartilage damage . The cartilage ( material provide cushion knee ) primary protection call degenerative arthritis osteoarthritis . We hope reduce swell prevent damage cartilage occur injury inject medication block one proteins responsible inflammation cartilage breakdown . This protein call interleukin-1 inhibited interleukin-1 receptor antagonist call anakinra . Anakinra inject directly injure knee response injection measure symptom analysis cartilage breakdown knee fluid blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Prevent Cartilage Damage Following Acute Knee Injury .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis highly prevalent significant impact health care utilization personal suffering . Injury predispose OA even surgical correction ( 1 , 2 ) . Definitive therapy establish OA lack current treatment increasingly question regard long-term safety . Interleukin-1 instrumental OA pathogenesis ( 3-5 ) . Recent study Chevalier demonstrate intra-articular use IL-1ra safe patient establish OA ( 6 ) . We hope show IL-1ra provide symptomatic benefit knee injury well decrease cartilage breakdown . The trial consist trial administer 150mg Anakinra , placebo , within 30 day acute knee injury require surgical repair . We hypothesize high IL-1 synovial fluid injury predict great symptomatic response IL-1ra . Outcome measure functional pain assessment regular interval surgery ( 7 , 8 ) . Cartilage catabolism assess two primary measure . First assess degree chondropathy via direct cartilage visualization score time arthroscopic repair ( 9 ) . Secondly , impact IL-1ra inflammatory milieu determine analysis serum synovial fluid cytokine level cartilage biomarkers enrollment time surgical repair . The impetus study base previous work do animal model OA , show prevention cartilage damage follow surgically induce ACL injury ( 10-12 ) . We believe intra-articular delivery anakinra within short time follow knee injury improve patient function pain reporting also prevent chondropathy result injury .</detailed_description>
