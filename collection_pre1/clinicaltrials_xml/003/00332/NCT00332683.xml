	<brief_summary>Anterior cervical spine surgery ( ACSS ) one common procedure perform spinal surgeon . It associate 30-50 % risk develop swallow difficulty ( dysphagia ) . Although difficulty usually improve within 6 month , remain significant persistent problem . We hypothesize lower cuff pressure low risk injury soft-tissues neck important swallowing function . Our objective study demonstrate low occurrence swallow problem anterior cervical spine surgery patient low endotracheal tube cuff pressure surgery . Forty patient randomly assign treatment group control group . The treatment group cuff pressure maintain 15mmHg entire duration procedure . The control group cuff pressure monitor without manipulation . After surgery soft-tissue swell assessed five routine neck x-ray take . In addition , 3 questionnaire complete surgery schedule follow-up appointment measure track change swallow time assess impact swallow function patient 's overall health . The result study may show make minor , inexpensive change operation may lower risk swallow difficulty relatively common surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Post-operative dysphagia well-documented complication anterior cervical spine surgery ( ACSS ) estimate risk 30 - 50 % patient experience degree post-operative swallowing dysfunction . While symptom often subside within 6 month impact swallow difficulty may far reach within health-care system . Patients may risk aspiration pneumonia require swallow assessment modify diet . These measure necessitate prolong hospital stay . Patients may prescribe anti-inflammatory medication steroid inhibit bony fusion , essential component heal ensure spinal stability follow ACSS . The ultimate goal project determine effect minimize ETT cuff pressure frequency post-operative dysphagia follow ACD . We believe maintain ETT cuff pressure 15mmHg decrease incidence post-operative dysphagia - direct benefit patient treatment group . Maintaining ETT cuff pressure 15mmHg would require additional intra-operative equipment modification exist equipment . This intervention would modify standard operative practice pose additional risk patient . As result cost-to-benefit ratio intervention may substantially favourable patient health care system .</detailed_description>
