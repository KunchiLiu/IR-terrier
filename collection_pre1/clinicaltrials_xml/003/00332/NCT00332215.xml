	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess safety inhale sodium pyruvate people Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) . Further , determine whether inhaled sodium pyruvate improve lung function , determine FEV1 , reduce inflammatory marker induce sputum people CF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Inhaled Sodium Pyruvate Treatment Cystic Fibrosis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) disease cause airway blockage infection damage lung . The lung CF patient frequently load inflammatory cell , damage protein oxidant . Oxidants molecules contain oxygen capable disrupt cell tissue . The CF protein involve transport important antioxidant glutathione ( GSH ) . Antioxidants molecules block oxidant render inactive . The absence protection airway make prone damage oxidant . Sodium pyruvate part body 's natural anti-oxidant defense system . Sodium pyruvate reacts directly oxygen radical neutralize increase cellular level glutathione . The purpose study investigate safety tolerability 3 different single dose level sodium pyruvate administer via nebulizer person CF lung disease . This phase I study 3 stage . In first stage subject receive one 3 possible dos active drug . In second stage subject receive 2 dos active drug 12 hour apart . In third stage subject receive either active drug placebo every 12 hour 4 week . For stage 1 subject come University Minnesota 's General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) screen visit . They return GCRC 1 7 day later baseline assessment follow study drug administration . The subject observe 4 hour safety parameter obtain . For stage 2 subject come GCRC screen visit . They return GCRC 1 7 day later baseline assessment follow study drug administration . Safety parameter obtain follow 4 hour . 12 hour first dose give subject receive second dose safety parameter obtain next 4 hour . For stage 3 subject come GCRC screen visit . They return GCRC 1 7 day later baseline assessment follow study drug administration . Safety parameter obtain follow 4 hour . The subject send home continue study drug every 12 hour follow 4 week . The subject ask return GCRC week safety assessment .</detailed_description>
