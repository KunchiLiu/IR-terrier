We develop HIV risk behavior intervention pregnant woman drug treatment , pilot intervention 20 woman , elicit feedback regard intervention . Following refinement intervention , conduct small randomize trial ( n=60 ) examine efficacy intervention relative standard care ( SC ) . We expect , relative SC , participant randomize intervention condition low level sex- drug-related HIV risk behavior . We also examine potential mechanism intervention produce reduction HIV risk behavior . If find efficacious , intervention help reduce acquisition HIV among pregnant drug abuser , improve health outcome woman children.Relevance Public Health : The propose study design develop test intervention reduce sex- drug-related behavior place pregnant drug abuser risk HIV infection .
