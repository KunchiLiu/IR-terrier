	<brief_summary>At least 14 % patient develop kidney failure cardiac surgery . Although kidney failure usually treat effectively , long stay intensive care often require . While many patient suffer long term ill effect develop post-operative kidney failure , require long term kidney dialysis . The investigator also know patient develop post-operative kidney failure much likely die leave hospital . Why people develop kidney failure cardiac surgery know . However , doctor suspect process cardiopulmonary bypass ( function heart lungs take machine operation , allow surgeon operate ) overactivates mechanisms body use defend severe infection . Many cell change severe infection cause kidney failure also occur cardiopulmonary bypass . One main overactive defence mechanism release highly toxic compound derive oxygen - process call 'oxidative stress ' . Another well-known cause oxidative stress paracetamol ( Panadol ) overdose . In large dos oxidative stress cause paracetamol damage cell liver , digest , kidney . N-acetylcysteine drug common use treatment paracetamol overdose . Patients would otherwise die liver failure routinely save N-acetylcysteine , act strong anti-oxidant . The investigator believe N-acetylcysteine might similarly reduce oxidative stress occur cardiac surgery , prevent decrease kidney failure occur many patient . The investigator hope give N-acetylcysteine ( similar dos use safely paracetamol poison ) patient , day cardiac surgery , compare effect patient N-acetylcysteine . The drug , 5 % glucose placebo , give drip present cardiac surgery patient . Whether particular patient receive drug placebo decide random , neither patient investigator know give . The investigator measure kidney function operation use standard test perform purpose clinical care every patient . Also , investigator extra test involve collection urine ( urinary catheter every patient cardiac surgery ) , provide even well measure kidney function . This potential benefit patient , test routinely perform , result available doctor intensive care unit . The investigator also take four 20ml sample blood , space , , operation , arterial catheter routinely insert every patient . This insignificant amount blood compare take test , would adverse effect . This blood would use measure oxidative stress , also proteins inside blood cell responsible create toxic oxygen compound . In way investigator discover effect N-acetylcysteine , mechanism effect . N-acetylcysteine routinely use treat paracetamol overdose side effect . An itchy skin rash common side effect . Sometimes patient develop nausea vomiting , treatment usually effective , drug stop occurs . Rarely , drug , allergic reaction report , report adverse effect . There extra risk patient participates study , discomfort normally associate cardiac surgery . The itchy rash occasionally develop N-acetylcysteine would occur anaesthetic , would almost certainly go time patient wake . Informed consent obtain patient prior operation one investigator ICU research nurse .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Renal impairment follow cardiopulmonary bypass common . 11.4 % ( 1 ) 42 % ( 2 ) patient previously normal renal function show postoperative rise serum creatinine . While patient require either short long term renal replacement , mortality patient acute renal failure substantially great develop renal dysfunction1 . Cardiopulmonary bypass activate component non-specific immune system , lead generation compound contain oxygen free radical . A study 14 patient undergoing cardiac surgery find increase level serum lipid peroxidation product ( thiobarbituric acid reactive substance ) within 15 minute commencement cardiopulmonary bypass , return preoperative level follow morning . The total serum antioxidative capacity correspondingly decrease intraoperatively , remain decreased 24 hour postoperatively ( 3 ) . A similar study total plasma antioxidant status show decreased level 72 hour postoperatively ( 4 ) . It clear cardiopulmonary bypass cause oxidative stress depletion antioxidant capacity . N-acetylcysteine routinely use treatment paracetamol overdose . Paracetamol metabolise liver cytochrome p450 form toxic reactive oxygen compound . This metabolite normally detoxified conjugation hepatic reduce glutathione ( GSH ) . In overdose , GSH store deplete , lead liver cell necrosis oxidative damage . N-acetylcysteine sulfydryl group donor , allow regeneration GSH , thus augment antioxidant defence liver . Treatment paracetamol overdose currently approve indication N-acetylcysteine . Possible adverse reaction include urticarial rash , nausea vomiting , anaphylactoid reaction ( involve hypotension , tachycardia , bronchospasm , facial oedema ) . These reaction occur commonly either , end , period load dose infusion , may concentration relate ( 5 ) . Oxidative stress produce experimentally use hypertonic glycerol . Intramuscular injection hypertonic glycerol rat precipitate acute renal failure associate marked decrease renal reduce glutathione ( GSH ) level . Pretreatment N-acetylcysteine largely prevent change ( 6 ) . During reperfusion renal ischaemia rat , renal blood flow reduce compare pre-ischaemic value . GFR also reduce , plasma peroxynitrite ( marker nitric oxide synthesis , component oxidative stress ) increase . Pretreatment N-acetylcysteine partially prevent change ( 7 ) . N-acetylcysteine ( combine nitric oxide donor endothelin convert enzyme inhibitor ) also decrease effect renal ischaemia/reperfusion injury dog , term improve renal function well reduce interstitial pro-inflammatory cytokine inducible nitric oxide synthase ( 8 ) . Radiocontrast commonly cause renal dysfunction , part oxidative stress kidney . While approved indication , intravenous N-acetylcysteine use successfully attenuate radiocontrast induce nephropathy , effective standard intravenous fluid prophylaxis ( relative risk 0.28 ) ( 9 ) . While approved product indication , N-acetylcysteine currently use hospital purpose . Infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair commonly cause ischaemia/reperfusion injury kidney , produce similar oxidative stress radiocontrast . A mixture antioxidants include N-acetylcysteine give patient undergo infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm repair produce significantly good creatinine clearance ( compare placebo control ) 48 hour postoperatively ( 10 ) . While never investigate effect renal function cardiac surgery , effect perioperative N-acetylcysteine system study . The oxidative burst response neutrophils patient undergo cardiopulmonary bypass significantly attenuate infusion N-acetylcysteine bypass circuit ( 11 ) . A study dog undergo cardiopulmonary bypass find preload-recruitable stroke work maintain pre-bypass level animal give N-acetylcysteine , whereas fell control animal . N-acetylcysteine significantly enhance myocardial oedema resolution , prevent rise plasma 8-isoprostane ( marker oxidative stress ) see control animal ( 12 ) . Similar result find study 40 patient undergoing cardiac surgery : leave ventricular biopsy specimen show less 8-isoprostane content less nitrotyrosine ( marker nitric oxide production ; nitric oxide act oxygen free radical ) . There differences haemodynamics clinical outcome note , unfortunately indices renal function examine study ( 13 ) . Ascorbate antioxidant might expect similar action N-acetylcysteine . Supplemental ascorbate give 43 patient , 5 day , coronary artery bypass surgery . Patients receive ascorbate 16.3 % incidence postoperative AF , compare 34.9 % control subject , perhaps reduce oxidative damage myocardium ( 14 ) . Pulmonary endothelium-dependent vasodilation usually impaired cardiopulmonary bypass , process think related reactive oxygen specie . Pulmonary vasodilation induce acetylcholine follow cardiopulmonary bypass well maintain 12 patient give cocktail antioxidant ( include N-acetylcysteine ) compare 10 control patient ( 15 ) . There thus evidence immune , cardiovascular respiratory system , N-acetylcysteine may benefit patient undergo cardiac surgery . Clinical sepsis experimental exposure lipopolysaccharide stimulate cell inflammatory system form oxygen free radical . N-acetylcysteine decrease cytokine adhesion molecule gene expression NF-kB activation vitro . In animal model sepsis N-acetylcysteine reduces inflammatory cell chemotaxis improve survival ( review ref . 16 ) . In patient suffer oxidative stress due sepsis , N-acetylcysteine result decrease NF-kB activation decrease IL-8 production ( 16 ) . Hypotheses N-acetylcysteine administered time induction anaesthesia prior cardiac surgery 24 hour postoperatively result decrease change serum creatinine baseline peak level within first 5 postoperative day . Other secondary outcome measure include : - good creatinine clearance first postoperative day ; - shorter ICU stay ; - shorter hospital stay ; - low serum creatinine level day 2 post-op ; - great plasma antioxidant activity ; - less oxidative stress ; - less NF-kB activation cellular component blood ; - less pro-inflammatory cytokine response ; - less activation nitric oxide synthase pathway . Study Design - overview rationale Patients randomise receive N-acetylcysteine induction anaesthesia 24 hour postoperatively , placebo ( 5 % glucose ) . Serum creatinine commonly use clinical indicator renal function along urine output . Both measure 48 hour postoperatively - time period renal impairment likely develop . A sensitive indicator renal dysfunction creatinine clearance . This measure first 24 hour postoperatively , form primary end point study . As patient intensive care unit routinely give frusemide maintain postoperative urine output &gt; 0.5ml/kg/hr ( fluid volume , inotropy vascular tone manipulate judge acceptable range ) , dose frusemide require also indicator renal function . Rarely diuretics give , though case also note . The efficacy N-acetylcysteine prevent oxidative stress assess use measure total plasma antioxidant activity ( bathocuproine assay ) ( 17 ) quantification 8-isoprostane level ( 18 ) . Total antioxidant activity 8-isoprostane previously show affected cardiac surgery N-acetylcysteine . Any renal effect N-acetylcysteine correlate level plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1 , IL-6 TNF-alpha ) , know associated oxidative-stress induce renal failure ( 19 , 20 ) . Activation inducible nitric oxide production also associate renal failure ( 21 ) , effect N-acetylcysteine nitric oxide synthase mRNA expression cellular component blood assayed real-time PCR . Nitric oxide production assess measurement plasma nitrotyrosine concentration . Assay nitrotyrosine superior traditional Greiss reaction ( measure nitrate nitrite derivative nitric oxide ) , nitrate nitrite undergo renal excretion , many patient alter renal function . At molecular level , many gene responsible stimulate oxidative stress regulate promoter NF-kB . The cellular component blood assayed NF-kB use establish ELISA technique ( 22 ) think sensitive electrophoretic mobility shift assay use demonstrate effect N-acetylcysteine human sepsis ( 16 ) . NF-kB cellular component blood also assay use real-time PCR . Randomisation The randomisation base random number generate computer . Once consent obtain , allocation either treatment N-acetylcysteine placebo organise independent person ( clinical trial pharmacist ) dispense cod infusion bag . This delivered anaesthetic staff look patient theatre , ICU nurse care patient postoperatively . Detailed protocol Immediately follow induction anaesthesia , prior first surgical incision , N-acetylcysteine administer dose 150 mg/kg IV 200 mL 5 % glucose 15 minute follow continuous IV infusion 50 mg/kg 500 mL 5 % glucose 4 hour , 100 mg/kg 1 L 5 % glucose 20 hour ( total dose 300 mg/kg 24 hour ) . This standard dose N-acetylcysteine use clinically paracetamol overdose ( 5 . ) Patients randomise receive placebo receive equivalent volume 5 % glucose . The appearance 5 % glucose N-acetylcysteine solution similar , mark infusion bag identify study number . A 24 hour urine collection begin immediately arrival ICU , allow determination creatinine clearance . This measured hospital clinical pathology laboratory . Creatinine clearance primary endpoint study . Clinical data record detailed investigator ICU research nurse . Four 20 ml sample heparinised blood take arterial line cytokine molecular analysis . Samples take immediately induction anaesthesia , arrival intensive care unit , 6 24 hour postoperatively . Immediately follow collection , blood centrifuge low speed separate plasma cellular component , store aliquot -70 degree prior batch analysis . Analysis plasma total antioxidant activity 8-isoprostane , IL-1 , IL-6 , TNF-alpha nitrotyrosine concentration perform use commercially available ELISA reagent kit ( Oxford Biomedical Research , Oxis Research , BioCore ) . The cellular component blood assayed NF-kB concentration use commercially available ELISA kit ( Oxford Biomedical Research ) , iNOS NF-kB mRNAs use real-time PCR machine Applied Biosystems pre-developed assay reagent 18S endogenous control . The principal investigator experience similar technique . Statistics power calculation Using data available cardiac surgery database 2500 patient last 5 year , expect mean increase serum creatinine baseline peak value 50 micromol/L control group , standard deviation 30 micromol/L . Given change , 60 patient need 90 % power detect 30 micromol/L difference control intervention group alpha 0.05 . Data collection Data collection perform principal investigator , ICU research nurse ICU nursing staff . The following variable obtain : Name gender , age , medical record number Date admission ICU Operative procedure time cardiopulmonary bypass Preoperative assessment leave ventricular function Serum creatinine urea preoperatively , immediately postoperatively , every 24 hour thereafter ( measured clinical purpose ) Doses frusemide administer ( rate frusemide infusion ) Use inotropes Cardiac output whenever measure clinical purpose first 24 hour postoperatively Urine output 6 hour period 24 hour postoperatively Date discharge ICU hospital death Protocol violation All protocol violation record . It decide whether nature violation patient exclude primary data analysis . Such evaluation blind treatment .</detailed_description>
