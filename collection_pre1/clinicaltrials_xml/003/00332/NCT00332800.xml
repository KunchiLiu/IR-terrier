	<brief_title>Study Impact Nutritional Supplementary Treatment Undernourished Stroke Patient Functional Outcome Measures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The World Health Organization define malnutrition `` cellular imbalance supply nutrient energy body 's demand ensure growth , maintenance , specific function '' . The prevalence malnutrition acute stroke patient vary 8 % - 34 % . It show acute stroke malnutrition present 16.3 % patient hospital admission , increase 26.4 % one week 35 % two week hospitalization . They also show 41 % malnourish stroke patient poor outcome , base presence urinary respiratory infection , pressure sore , increased mortality rate , great neurological deficit longer length stay , compare 14 % malnourish patient well outcome3 . Prevalence study malnutrition stroke patient admit acute rehabilitation hospital vary 49 % 60 % . This high prevalence undernutrition post stroke patient due : inadequate intake , poor nutritional status prior stroke onset , age , immobility increase muscle wasting , high level dependency , increase energy demand recovery period , depression , dysphagia . In dysphagic stroke patient due impair chew swallow bulbar muscle weakness , decrease sensation mastication oral accumulation solid food result inadequate nutrient intake . Cognitive , perceptual , visual field deficit motor apraxia contribute impair self feeding ability consequently increase risk undernutrition population . Undernutrition identify modifiable factor associate poor functional outcome increase length stay . Potter et al systematic review nutritional supplementation adult suggest routine nutritional supplementation improve weight anthropometry , validate measure nutritional status ; well improve functional outcome . Oral sip feeding show improve nutritional intake non-dysphagic patient improve clinical outcome . Potter et al , trial 381 poorly nourished patient find high energy protein oral supplement administer medication pas associate significantly well energy intake weight gain , along reduction mortality improvement functional outcome . Thus increase energy protein justify acute post stroke nutritionally compromise patient improve outcome decrease mortality . Oral nutritional supplement advantage ease administration irrespective oral enteral feed route , aseptic packaging ensure patient safety , ability administer different consistency , reproducibility due pre-measured formula , establish product approve part hospital formulary . Undernutrition assessment treatment acute stroke remain problem hospital setting . We therefore decide : 1 ) evaluate impact aggressive nutritional supplementation addition intake regular diet functional outcome measure ; 2 ) association dysphagia nutritional status post-stroke .</detailed_description>
