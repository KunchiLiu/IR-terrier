	<brief_title>Metvix PDT Versus Vehicle PDT With Aktilite CL128 Lamp Patients With Actinic Keratosis Face Scalp</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Actinic keratoses pre-malignant skin lesion , may develop squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) . They usually small , thin , erythematous , de-squamating lesion light expose atrophic skin lesion often multiple . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) selective destruction abnormal cell light activation photosensitiser presence oxygen . These cell accumulate photosensitiser normal cell . The photosensitiser generate reactive oxygen specie upon illumination . For skin disease , actinic keratosis ( AK ) , increase interest use topically apply precursor photoactive porphyrin ( PAP ) . The commonly used precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid ( ALA ) derivative . The present test drug contain methyl aminolevulinate , penetrate lesion well show high lesion selectivity . Different light source ( i.e . CureLight , Aktilite CL16 Aktilite CL128 ) use activation PAP , absorbs light range 400-700 nm . The present study use Aktilite CL 128 lamp . Aktilite 128 base LED technology emits narrow red light spectrum average wavelength 630 ( +/-5 ) nm . This study similar two study perform , U.S. approval Metvixia® cream base except light source use . This study one two study perform document safety efficacy Aktilite CL 128 lamp use combination Metvixia® cream . Previous study show risk attribute Metvixia® PDT relate mainly transient pain local erythema shortly treatment . These reaction part expect local phototoxicity reaction . PDT offer advantage treatment modality actinic keratosis , non-invasive treatment available outpatient basis . Several separate lesion treat simultaneously lesion ( ) treat repeatedly success . There know systemic toxicity interaction medication . The treatment also lesion selective , leave surround tissue intact functional , also allow excellent cosmetic result treatment .</detailed_description>

Patients receive local treatment ( include cryotherapy curretage ) face / scalp area within last 30 day . Patients receive topical treatment ( include imiquimod , 5FU diclofenac ) face / scalp area within last 3 month . Pregnant breastfeeding : All woman childbearing potential must use adequate contraception ( oral contraceptive , intrauterine device , contraceptive skin patch , etc ) treatment period one month thereafter . In addition , must negative pregnancy test prior treatment . Any condition may associate risk poor protocol compliance . Patients currently receive regular ultraviolet radiation therap</criteria>
