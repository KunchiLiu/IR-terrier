	<brief_summary>Cutaneous cancer-related pain difficult treat . These patient often prescribed high systemic dosage opioids . Yet , many patient continue report pain experience dose-limiting side effect . An alternative approach systemic administration apply topical medication . The advantage topical application potential achieve good analgesia use low dosage , , systemic side effect . Current clinical data indicates , topically apply morphine analgesic effect patient severe pain may even improve wound healing . The clinical report far either case study double blind randomly control trial small sample size patient . There still great deal information lack modality treatment regard one hand , mechanism action , clinical issue . For example , mechanism effect actually peripheral ? What adequate dose analgesic medication different type skin condition ? Wound heal quantified . We apply morphine topically skin wound cancer evaluate effect treatment pain , side effect , quantify wound healing , quantify morphine metabolite blood urine . Should well control study , demonstrate peripheral effect topical morphine , clinical application treatment modality would possible . This could contribute towards well treatment patient , pain difficult treat , time , intractable .</brief_summary>
