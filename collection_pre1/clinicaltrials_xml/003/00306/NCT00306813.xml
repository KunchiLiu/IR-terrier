	<detailed_description>Multiple myeloma incurable disease characterize malignant proliferation plasma cell . It second common hematological malignancy , invariable fatal . The primary approach treatment multiple myeloma systemic chemotherapy . Conventional chemotherapy melphalan prednisone ( MP ) increase survival 12-17 month approximately 3 year . But several study show combination therapy addition agent cyclophosphamide , nitroureas anthracyclins improve prognosis patient multiple myeloma . During past year demonstrate high dose chemotherapy follow autologous stem cell transplantation prolong overall survival myeloma patient therefore become standard care younger patient . Since demonstrate high dose chemotherapy also well tolerate elderly high dose chemotherapy recommend patient age 70 relevant comorbidity . Thus , development effective regimen teatment relapse refractory myeloma patient urgently need . Treatment corticosteroid alone induce response primarily resistant relapsed patient myeloma . High pulse dexamethasone ( 40mg daily d1-4 , 9-12 17-21 ) show response rate 27 % primarily unresponsive patient 21 % relapsed patient , initially responsive . In combination anthracyclins like VAD-regimen ( vincristin , adriamycin , dexamethasone ) response rate 31 % achieve primary unresponsive patient whereas response rate 65 % patient relapse , previously respond therapy . Thus , combination dexamethasone anthracyclines vincristin achieve certain anti-myeloma activity relapse refractory patient . Nevertheless due neurotoxicity , treatment vincristin elderly patient critical limit . Therefore substitution vincristine less toxic agent high anti-myeloma activity like new thalidomide analogue ( see ) could reduce toxicity improve therapeutic efficacy anthracycline dexamethasone containing regimen . Protocol DSMM VII Page 7/52 29.09.2004 Version 1.1 dexamethasone containing regimen . One interesting drug substantial anti-myeloma activity patient relapse refractory myeloma thalidomide . Thalidomide demonstrate induce remission one third relapse myeloma patient give single agent therapy . Response rate evaluate phase-II study could improve 55 % thalidomide administer combination drug glucocorticoid . However substantial side effect observe somnolence , constipation neuropathy . These observation lead development derivative thalidomide order reduce toxicity improve efficacy . The thalidomide analogues represent new class active drug base immunmodulatory direct anti-myeloma effect demonstrate great potency inhibit growth MM angiogenesis vitro vivo thalidomide . In phase I study heavily pretreated patient relapse refractory myeloma treat CC-5013 ( RevlimidTM , lenalidomide ) . Revlimid dose 25 mg/day safe well tolerate . The dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) myelosupression dose level 50 mg/day . In contrast thalidomide treatment CC- 5013 show significant side effect like somnolence , constipation neuropathy . In addition 29 % subject achieve &gt; 50 % paraprotein reduction , 71 % reduction &gt; 25 % . Preliminary phase II data show 20 % relapsed myeloma patient &gt; 50 % reduction paraprotein , &gt; 25 % reduction could observe 50 % . No additional toxicity observe combination dexamethasone . Thus , Revlimid single agent well tolerate profound anti-myeloma activity patient refractory relapse disease . These data suggest Revlimid combined chemotherapy could lead enhanced anti-myeloma effect acceptable toxicity . The present study investigate safety efficacy intermittent dose CC-5013 ( Revlimid ) combine Dexamethasone Doxorubicin treatment relapse refractory myeloma .
