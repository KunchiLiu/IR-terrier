	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety effectiveness PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) administer injection subcutaneously ( SC , skin ) , dose 80,000 U every four week 40,000 U every two anemic patient cancer receive chemotherapy radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) 80,000 Units ( U ) Once Every Four Weeks ( Q4W ) vs. 40,000 U Once Every Two Weeks ( Q2W ) Cancer Patients Not Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epoetin alfa analogue ( identical amino acid sequence ) erythropoetin , hormone secrete kidney know stimulate red blood cell production . Although epoetin alfa know effective treatment anemia associate cancer chemotherapy , specific formal guideline use epoetin alfa treatment anemia cancer patient receive chemotherapy radiation therapy . Several prospective clinical trial investigate efficacy epoetin alfa cancer-associated anemia include group patient receive chemotherapy demonstrate use epoetin alfa population safe effective increase hemoglobin ( Hb ) level reduce transfusion requirement . The optimal dose regimen epoetin alfa cancer patient receive chemotherapy radiation therapy remain unclear . This 17-week study prospective , randomize , open-label , multi-center study ass safety effectiveness epoetin alfa anemic patient cancer receive chemotherapy radiation therapy . Eligible patient hemoglobin level &lt; = 11 g/dL receive epoetin alfa 40,000 U every 2 week 15 week 80,000 U every 4 week 13 week . The study hypothesis long-term safety concern epoetin alfa administer two dose regimen dose regimen equally effective patient population . Eligible patient hemoglobin level &lt; = 11 g/dL receive epoetin alfa 40,000 U every 2 week 15 week 80,000 U every 4 week 13 week .</detailed_description>
