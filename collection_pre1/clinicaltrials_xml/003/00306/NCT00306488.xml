	<brief_title>OT-551 Antioxidant Eye Drops Treat Geographic Atrophy Age-Related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular Degeneration ( AMD ) , lead cause blindness people age 55 U.S. , heterogeneous clinical entity retinal degeneration occur predominantly macula context age lead impairment primarily central visual acuity . AMD occur two general form , one involve subchoroidal neovascularization subsequent formation disciform scar . A second form , subject study , term `` dry '' atrophic macular degeneration involve constellation clinical feature include drusen , pigment clump and/or retinal pigment epithelium ( RPE ) dropout , geographic atrophy . Geographic atrophy begin thin RPE involvement underlie choriocapillaris lead subsequently atrophic change macula . The therapy person atrophic AMD oral supplement contain high dos antioxidant zinc , test National Eye Institute ( NEI ) large , multicenter , double-masked , placebo-controlled clinical trial average participant follow-up 6 year . This antioxidant therapy show modestly retard progression dry AMD intermediate stage advance stage demonstrate benefit antioxidant therapy disease . In study , evaluate Othera Pharmaceuticals ' OT-551 antioxidant eye drop chronic treatment dry form AMD . This single-center , open-label , study 10 participant bilateral geographic atrophy design characterize safety 0.45 percent concentration OT-551 eye drop , give 3 time day , participant geographic atrophy area three year . Participants one eye randomize receive eye drop fellow eye observe .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Participant must understand sign protocol 's informed consent document ( participant 's vision impair point possible read inform consent document , inform consent document read entirety participant ) . 2 . Participant must able administer eye drop caretaker administer eye drop . 3 . Participant must geographic atrophy ( GA ) present eye compatible agerelated macular degeneration ( AMD ) . GA define one welldefined , usually less circular patch partial complete depigmentation RPE , typically exposure underlie choroidal blood vessel . Even much RPE appear preserve large choroidal vessel visible , roundish patch RPE partial depigmentation may still classify early GA . The GA eye must able photographed entirety contiguous area peripapillary atrophy , complicate area measurement . 4 . Participant must steady fixation study eye foveal parafoveal area medium clear enough good quality photograph . 5 . Female participant child bear potential ( postmenopausal surgically sterile ) may participate lactate agree adequate birth control method . 4.5 Exclusion Criteria 1 . Participant &gt; 60 year age ( minimize fundus change cause AMD ) . 2 . Participant another investigational study actively receive study therapy . 3 . Participant unable comply study procedure followup visit . 4 . Participant evidence ocular disease AMD either eye may confound outcome study ( e.g. , diabetic retinopathy , uveitis , etc. ) . 5 . Participant chronic requirement ( e.g. , â‰¥ four week time ) ocular medication disease , judgment examine physician , vision threatening may affect primary outcome ( artificial tear permit ) . 6 . Participant evidence pseudovitelliform macular degeneration may confound outcome study either eye . 7 . Participant evidence vitreoretinal traction maculopathy may confound outcome study either eye . 8 . Participant history laser , photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , intravitreal injection agent ( e.g. , antiVEGF , triamcinolone , etc . ) , previous treatment AMD AREDS equivalent supplement formulation study eye . 9 . Participant vitrectomy , penetrate keratoplasty , trabeculectomy trabeculoplasty . 10 . Participant undergone lens removal last three month . 11 . Participant chemotherapy . 12 . Participant ocular systemic medication know toxic lens , retina , optic nerve . 13 . Participant history malignancy would compromise 2year study survival . 14 . Participant history ocular Herpes simplex virus . 15 . Participant history demonstration allergy benzakonium chloride , preservative agent use eye drop .</criteria>
