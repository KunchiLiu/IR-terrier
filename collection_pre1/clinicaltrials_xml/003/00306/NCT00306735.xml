	<detailed_description>A number multiple-day chemotherapy regimens involve moderately highly emetogenic agent use treatment cancer . Further , patient undergo high-dose conditioning regimen combination bone marrow stem cell transplant remain poorly control term CINV . Patients treat regimen risk develop CINV treatment well delay setting . Palonosetron date , study single-day moderately highly emetogenic chemotherapy regimen . It interest , therefore , explore safety efficacy palonosetron administer multiple-day chemotherapy regimen . For purpose , population receiving melphalan ( 100 mg/m^2 ) condition regimen stem cell transplant treatment multiple myeloma select .</detailed_description>
