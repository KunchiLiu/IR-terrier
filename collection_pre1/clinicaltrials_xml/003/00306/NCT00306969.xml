	<brief_summary>This pilot study safety tolerability photopheresis combination increase dos oral bexarotene patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.Our hypothesis combination bexarotene photopheresis safe bexarotene enhance immune response set extracorporeal photopheresis treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) , result short time clinical response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Oral Bexarotene Combination With Photopheresis Treatment Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Photopheresis FDA-approved device treatment patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . Using treatment schedule monthly treatment , treatment consist two consecutive day photopheresis , initial response rate 20-60 % report . However , publication , attain complete response , median time response 11 month ( range 5 14 month ) . Response show correlate intact immune function patient normal CD8+ cell prior therapy . The mechanism activity photopheresis cutaneous T-cell lymphoma fully understood involves apoptosis malignant tumor cell . Modifications original scheduling photopheresis , short cycle 2 3 week , meet success . Several center use accelerated delivery schedule treatment , treat patient every 2 week . Bexarotene FDA approve patient CTCL . It RXR selective retinoid . Retinoids serve physiologic rather cytotoxic drug arrest reverse process carcinogenesis . There grow body evidence support role retinoids induction apoptosis . In two , complete Phase II-III study form basis approval ( approve dose 300mg/m2/day ) bexarotene capsule , 193 patient previously treat CTCL administer bexarotene capsule . Response rate order 50 % 300mg/2/day , however , 79 % patient hyperlipidemia . This study therefore primarily examine safety tolerability use increase dos bexarotene combination photopheresis . As secondary endpoint , attempt establish whether bexarotene upregulate immune response therefore potentially enhance response rate photopheresis patient CTCL . Six cohorts patient treat : Dose level cohort enrollment sequential centralize dose assignment Boston Medical Center To establish safety , 30 day pause occur cohort . During 30 day wait period , additional patient able enter open cohort , provide grade 3 4 toxicity 3 patient already enter cohort . Once 30 day period end , new patient able enter next cohort . Cohort 1 ( 3 patient ) : Bexarotene give dose 75mg po per day food 7 day prior begin photopheresis ( Day –6 0 , day 1 day photopheresis begin first day cycle 1 ) . Photopheresis perform 2 consecutive day first 2 day 21 day cycle . Bexarotene give concurrently photopheresis 4 cycle . The duration study 3 month premature discontinuation toxicity discretion investigator , progressive disease . Cohort 2 ( 3 patient ) : Bexarotene give dose 150 mg po per day food 7 day prior begin photopheresis ( Day –6 0 , day 1 day photopheresis begin first day cycle 1 ) . Photopheresis perform 2 consecutive day first 2 day 21 day cycle . Bexarotene give concurrently photopheresis 4 cycle . The duration study 3 month premature discontinuation toxicity discretion investigator , progressive disease . Cohort 3 ( 3 patient ) : Bexarotene give dose 225 mg po per day food 7 day prior begin photopheresis ( Day –6 0 , day 1 day photopheresis begin first day cycle 1 ) . Photopheresis perform 2 consecutive day first 2 day 21 day cycle . Bexarotene give concurrently photopheresis 4 cycle . The duration study 3 month premature discontinuation toxicity discretion investigator , progressive disease . Cohort 4 ( 3 patient ) : Bexarotene give dose 300 mg po per day food 7 day prior begin photopheresis ( Day –6 0 , day 1 day photopheresis begin first day cycle 1 ) . Photopheresis perform 2 consecutive day first 2 day 21 day cycle . Bexarotene give concurrently photopheresis 4 cycle . The duration study 3 month premature discontinuation toxicity discretion investigator , progressive disease . Cohort 5 ( 3 patient ) : Bexarotene give dose 375 mg po per day food 7 day prior begin photopheresis ( Day –6 0 , day 1 day photopheresis begin first day cycle 1 ) . Photopheresis perform 2 consecutive day first 2 day 21 day cycle . Bexarotene give concurrently photopheresis 4 cycle . The duration study 3 month premature discontinuation toxicity discretion investigator , progressive disease . Cohort 6 ( 3 patient ) : Bexarotene give dose 450 mg po per day food 7 day prior begin photopheresis ( Day –6 0 , day 1 day photopheresis begin first day cycle 1 ) . Photopheresis perform 2 consecutive day first 2 day 21 day cycle . Bexarotene give concurrently photopheresis 4 cycle . The duration study 3 month premature discontinuation toxicity discretion investigator , progressive disease . Toxicity assess use National Cancer Institute common Toxicity Criteria begin 21 day cycle . Assessments every 3 week final follow-up visit . All patient undergo skin biopsy lesional skin prior entry confirm active disease . A portion biopsy use immunohistochemical study identify population activate lymphocyte skin identify apoptotic marker ( TUNNEL METHOD ) . A skin biopsy subsequently obtain 7 day bexarotene , end study . A portion skin biopsy use immunohistochemical study identify population activate lymphocyte skin ( TGF-B Fas malignant T cell ) identify apoptotic marker ( TUNNEL method ) All patient undergo baseline study immune function , include FACS analysis circulate lymphocyte population identify activation antigen T-lymphocytes , well vitro assay T-cell function proliferation assay cytokine production culture T-cells . These study repeat second fourth . For assay , one green top tube draw day 1 photopheresis day 2 completion therapy . One serum tube ( one red top ) drawn day 1 2 serum store -20° assay perform . In summary , follow research skin biopsy labs obtain : Baseline ( Day –6 ) : one green top one red top Baseline ( Day –6 ) : skin biopsy lesional skin Day 1 cycle 1 : skin biopsy lesional skin Cycles 2 4 : Day 1 : one green top one red top Day 2 one green top one red top End cycle 4 : skin biopsy lesional skin In addition follow evaluation , BASELINE visit include history patient demographic . At baseline , tri-weekly , final visit , follow information collect : - Patient weight . - Serum chemistry , include LDH , LFTS , albumin , uric acid , Ca , Phos , Mg , Cholesterol , Triglycerides , Thyroid function ( T4 , TSH ) - CBC differential , Sezary count applicable - ECOG score . - Skin assessment ( previously publish weighted skin score ) description symptom attribute CTCL , final visit , overall assessment - Names dos concomitant medication - Quality Life assessment ( Skindex-29 FACT-G ) The investigator also evaluate patient ’ response organ system involvement , overall assessment , follow : - Complete Response ( CR ) : Resolution manifestation CTCL last one month . - Partial Response ( PR ) : A 50 % improvement sum total disease ( CTCL ) last one month . - No Change ( NC ) : Failure meet criterion either response progressive disease . - Progression : 25 % progression exist disease appearance new disease ( disease worsen ) . - Flare : After initial response ( either CR PR ) , increase manifestation CTCL require additional treatment .</detailed_description>
