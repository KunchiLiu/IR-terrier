	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate rate response administer rituximab suppress eliminate anti-body patient 's blood inhibits effectiveness factor replacement product compare treatment use cyclophosphamide . This Phase 2/3 study find effect ( good bad ) response rituximab patient anti-Factor VIII antibody . Also , compare effect ( good bad ) rituximab cyclophosphamide patient anti-Factor VIII antibody see well . This research do know treatment regimen ( rituximab cyclophosphamide ) effective eliminate suppress anti-Factor VIII antibody patient acquire Hemophilia A .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Rituximab Versus Oral Cyclophosphamide Eradicate Suppress Autoimmune Anti-Factor VIII Antibodies Acquired Hemophilia A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective Phase II randomize multi-institutional controlled pilot trial compare regimen single agent rituximab 6 week cytotoxic therapy oral cyclophosphamide eradicate suppress autoimmune anti-factor VIII antibody individual acquire hemophilia A . Patients randomize receive either two regimen autoimmune anti-factor VIII antibody prove refractory initial upfront immunosuppressive treatment oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day ( equivalent corticosteroid dos ) 3 week . Patients randomize treatment cohort accord biostatistical method .</detailed_description>
