	<brief_summary>Radiographic contrast agent administer patient undergo diagnostic interventional catheterization procedure . Injection contrast enables visualization vasculature X-ray base fluoroscopy cineangiographic imaging . Unfortunately , use radiographic contrast agent often associate severe adverse side effect , include acute kidney failure . Acute kidney failure follow exposure intravascular contrast agent also know Radiocontrast Nephropathy ( RCN ) . Physiologic factor may put patient high risk develop RCN include : pre-existing renal insufficiency , diabetes mellitus , age , cardiovascular disease ( particularly congestive heart failure low ejection fraction ) , dehydration condition characterize depletion effective circulatory volume . These risk factor relatively common patient undergoing catheterization procedure . Treatment high-risk patient modify , hydration and/or minimize contrast volume ; however despite effort , RCN remain well-recognized complication coronary catheterization procedure . Given frequency detrimental consequence RCN , compel clinical need safe effective therapy reduce incidence RCN . One potential therapy endovascular cooling induce mild hypothermia . This study design evaluate whether endovascular cool reduce incidence RCN high-risk patient undergoing diagnostic interventional catheterization procedure .</brief_summary>
