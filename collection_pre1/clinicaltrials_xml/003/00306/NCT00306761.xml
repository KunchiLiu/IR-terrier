	<brief_summary>Cerebral palsy ( CP ) non-degenerative neuromuscular disease exist occur result birth . Because damage one part brain control movement , affect child control muscle normally . Prevalence CP similar worldwide , pronounced severity underdeveloped country due poor health financial condition . Research conduct find method medical treatment allow affect child maintain regain musculoskeletal functionality . Many child affect CP spend much day restrict rigid wheelchair ; limit muscular cognitive development , make difficult interact environment . The gap address study determine wheelchair base dynamic human anatomy allow enhanced function , adaptive individual growth development . At present , little dynamic capability available commercial wheelchair allow mobility . A dynamic wheelchair system recently design small sample able-bodied child test chair . It hypothesize significant increase functional mobility achieve child CP use novel wheelchair design .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Dynamic Wheelchair Seating Spasticity Functional Mobility Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specifically , expect range motion functional mobility hip , knee , ankle joint increase , involuntary spasticity musculature mid low body reduce , independent daily function enhance child CP . The success condition greatly influence child 's interaction surround environment , maintain neuromuscular function provide enhanced mobility coordinate development childhood . This research bring great benefit child CP , however child neuromuscular condition also benefit finding initial study . Specifically , direct health benefit include increase joint range motion , reduction spasticity , enhance cognitive development muscle coordination . The concept novel wheelchair design could apply domestically within one year project completion . If fund , initial study lead subsequent project two year , would focus feasibility broaden target population include child under-represented area within United States develop country . Twenty child ( 4-12 year ) CP recruit study surround community great Rocky Mountain region . The study volunteer randomly assign either experimental group ( use new dynamic seating system ) , control group ( use standard , state art non-dynamic chair system ) . Consent obtain child parents/guardians . The study consist pre-chair laboratory session , supervise chair adaptation period ( include mid-way laboratory session ) follow-up laboratory session . The pre-chair , mid-way follow laboratory session consist series cognitive/communicative , fine motor , functional skill test . Evaluation test conduct physical , occupational , speech therapist . The wheelchair effect test significant improvement joint range motion , muscle spasticity tone , independent functionality .</detailed_description>
