Healthy volunteer 20 60 year age people 20 90 year age stroke result swallow problem may eligible study . Volunteers screen medical history , physical examination , urine test woman rule pregnancy . Stroke patient screen additionally chest x-ray , physical examination , cognitive screening , swallow questionnaire , nasoendoscopy ( examination nasal passages back throat use light telescopic instrument ) FEESST ( passage thin , flexible telescope nose voice box ) , videofluoroscopy ( x-ray head neck swallow ) button press training ( learn press button table coordination swallow ) . All participant undergo follow procedure : - Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) : A metal coil place head send pulse energy brain scalp . The muscle response pulse record muscle throat associate swallowing . - Electromyography : A needle use insert tiny wire specific muscle throat record muscle response TMS pulse . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : During brain MRI scanning , subject lie quietly image brain take . In addition test , stroke patient undergo follow : - Water test : The subject swallow small amount water number time require clear throat cough count . This test repeat five time . - Experimental training . Subjects total 12 60-minute training session , one session day 5 session week . - Button press training : The subject swallow small amount water . A device place throat sense swallow occurs . The subject learns coordinate press button table coordination swallow . - Vibrotactile stimulator training : A device use buzz vibration place throat time swallow training . - Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) : Wires attach sponge electrode place scalp eye . Small electric current deliver area brain involve swallowing . This do time swallow training . Participants may receive one several combination train approach ; receive volitional ( button-press ) training . Within 5 day complete training , subject repeat test . TMS , MRI , MEG x-ray study swallow function also repeat see change occur brain ability swallow training . Patients contact telephone write 3 6 month train follow-up swallowing status oral intake .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Chronic pharyngeal dysphagia life threaten disorder follow brain injury . Repeated occurrence aspiration pneumonia result expensive hospital stay reduce survival . The purpose investigation compare two novel train method : 1 ) training initiate swallow press switch ; 2 ) training initiate swallow press switch coincident peripheral vibrotactile stimulation . Some preliminary study conduct healthy volunteer determine feasibility use near infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) measure change brain activation swallow treatment determine physiological effect direct current stimulation brain activation swallowing , sensory stimulation rest . Patients randomly assign one two training group result 12 training session contrast use blind assessment . The hypothesis test training method involve simultaneous peripheral-sensory stimulation reduce risk aspiration penetration swallow patient chronic pharyngeal dysphagia post brain injury . Two additional question address neural mechanism involve training effect . To determine whether change occur cortical control hyo-laryngeal musculature involve swallowing , patient also study train use transcranial magnetic stimulation ass muscle response cortical stimulation . Finally , determine training effect relate change cortical neuroplasticity , use near infrared spectroscopy measure functional change brain activation M1 , swallow determine cortical control enhance different training group . Study Population : Healthy volunteer patient chronic pharyngeal dysphagia follow brain injury study . Design : Healthy control subject assess first three study : 1 . A study compare effect air puff versus vibrotactile stimulation induce swallow 2 . A study transcranial magnetic stimulation elicit response pharyngeal submental muscle 3 . A study use near infrared spectroscopy examine brain activation responses sensory stimulation , brain laterality swallow effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) brain response sensory stimulation brain activation swallow . Patients chronic pharyngeal dysphagia follow brain injury participate clinical trial evaluate swallow motor retrain without sensory stimulation . This study randomize , blind Phase 2 clinical trial patient assign two training condition : training sham sensory stimulation training vibrotactile sensory stimulation . A non-invasive , external vibrotactile stimulator throat provide external sensory stimulation . Pre-training testing , training session , post-training testing provide 20 visit subject . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome variable measure swallow function train 3 6 month post train . These include NIH Swallowing Safety Scale score masked videofluoroscopy recording Water Test , non-invasive assessment swallowing . Both score speech pathologist blind patient training group identity condition training . To assess relationship improvement training change neuronal function , transcranial magnetic stimulation surface electromyography recording use assess change corticobulbar conduction follow training . To assess whether functional activation within brain ( particularly region M1 ) relate improvement swallow follow type training , near infrared spectroscopy NIRS use examine blood oxygenation level dependent change brain function swallow follow training . All outcome measure score without knowledge training group condition ( pre vs. post training train group ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA FOR PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC PHARYNGEAL DYSPHAGIA DUE TO BRAIN INJURY Inclusive age 20 90 History brain injury . No specific localization brain injury brain injuyr type require inclusion . Evidence pharyngeal phase dysphagia follow brain injury place patient risk aspiration . Risk aspiration frank aspiration base medical history evidence videofluoroscopic swallow study . Absence aspiration cause exclusion risk aspiration deem present due impair pharyngeal phase swallow judge expert experienced evaluation dysphagia . The patient may demonstrate evidence aspiration risk aspiration consistency , perhaps secondary pharyngeal retention . Aspiration define passage food , liquid , secretion trachea level vocal fold . If patient demonstrate either aspiration risk aspiration previous assessment preliminary study , exclude participation . Impaired pharyngeal phase swallowing may evidence pharyngeal delay , reduce hyolaryngeal elevation , reduce laryngeal closure , reduce pharyngeal clearance bolus . Signs pharyngeal delay include hesitation material vallecula time spill pyriform sinus . Normally pharyngeal phase swallow less 1 second onset passage bolus posterior pharynx . Delay define time entry head bolus oropharynx posterior tongue lower posterior edge angle mandible , begin elevation hyoid bone larynx . Reduced hyolaryngeal elevation identify larynx protected remains open bolus swallow videoendoscopy . Reduced pharyngeal clearance see videoendoscopy bolus remain vallecula and/or pyriform sinus . Chronic dysphagia occur result stroke brain injury . Lesions either hemisphere and/or brain stem may cause dysphagia aspiration . Duration 4 month great postonset brain injury dysphagia Participants may health problem diabetes mellitus , arteriosclerotic coronary vascular disease history smoking . These cause automatic exclusion , examine individual basis otolaryngologist determine potential risk benefit individual participant . Prior history tracheostomy current tracheostomy cause exclusion . The otolaryngologist determine individual tracheostomy appropriate candidate study . Patients restrict diet level . This may include diet level restriction pureed chop solid , restriction certain solid food item , thicken liquid . Patients may receive alternate mean nutrition hydration ( PEG , PEJ , PPN/TPN ) nutritional intake , may receive nutritional intake orally .
