	<brief_summary>The objective study determine concentration amiodarone fat tissue increase constantly time chronic treatment drug , blood concentration reflect accurately concentration fat tissue . This excessive concentration drug tissue produce adverse effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Concentrations Amiodarone Fat Tissue During Chronic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amiodarone effective treat cardiac arrhythmia use limited toxicity , specially chronic treatment . Accumulation drug tissue probably cause majority amiodarone delay adverse effect . However , prove obtain tissue sample usually difficult aggressive . The investigator study , patient follow chronic treatment amiodarone , needle aspiration provide sample fat tissue useful accurately determine amiodarone concentration , concentration fat tissue correlate cumulate dose , concentration fat tissue correlate concentration blood , easy obtain . The investigator expect knowledge help understand amiodarone develop adverse effect possibly lead new way monitor treatment drug , adapt dos chronic administration .</detailed_description>
