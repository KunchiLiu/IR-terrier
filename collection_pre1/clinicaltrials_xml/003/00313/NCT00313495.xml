	<detailed_description>COHORT ( Cooperative Huntington Observational Research Trial ) coordinate research effort Huntington Study Group research center worldwide prospectively collect data consent individual affect Huntington 's disease ( HD ) part HD family . The systematically accrue data annual prospective assessment relate clinical characteristic ( phenotype ) family genetic environmental factor . The knowledge relationship well inform u onset progression HD , help identify potential intervention HD , aid planning research study experimental treatment aim slow postpone onset HD . The consented collection biological sample provide research material correlative data scientist identify biomarkers parallel development progression HD . Identification biomarkers turn contribute understand HD enhance efficiency power disease-modifying therapeutic trial .</detailed_description>
