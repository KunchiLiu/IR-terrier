	<brief_title>Sources Variability Response Fluindione Elderly Patients ( PREPA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral anticoagulant drug improve prognosis patient thromboembolic disease . However , optimal oral anticoagulation control usually hamper significant interindividual variability couple narrow therapeutic window . In elderly , variability enhance concurrent medication , nutritional status physical condition . Age correlate increase severity complication , adverse event due anticoagulant drug think responsible 5000 deaths year France . Although half patient receive anticoagulant treatment 80 , one study target population far . We therefore propose study pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) component response fluindione , main oral anticoagulant use France , patient 80 . 150 patient begin fluindione treatment ( resume 2 week rest ) recruit follow department : Geriatric , Cardiology , Nephrology , Cardiac Surgery , Internal Medicine ( CHU Bichat-Claude Bernard , Paris ) Metabolic Diseases Internal Medicine ( CHU d'Angers ) . Blood sample take place begin study ( J0 ) measure baseline INR coagulation factor II VII . Fluindione concentration also measure non-naive patient . INR , coagulation factor fluindione measure J2 , J4 , J6 , J8 , twice weekly leave hospital month . Many covariates record : age , gender , concurrent medication , biochemical analysis , functional nutritional status . We also investigate genetic factor collect DNA genotype polymorphism related target drug . Recent work show response common anticoagulant drug metabolism influence genetic polymorphism , convince evidence drug target control genetic polymorphism play major role variability response . Throughout study , physician remain free adapt drug regimen prescribe additional INR measurement . Data analysis perform INSERM Unit 738 ( CHU Bichat-Claude Bernard ) use nonlinear mixed-effect model , statistical technique allow analysis sparse data quantify source variability . We expect gain good understand role age , nutritional status , genetic factor drug interaction variability response fluindione . We also assess whether measure activity coagulation factor help anticipate dangerous increase INR . These goal vital provide good care elderly minimise cost arise frequency severe side-effects . Future perspective include development software recommendation help adapt anticoagulant treatment elderly , take account condition .</detailed_description>
