	<criteria>( Phase I II unless otherwise specify ) Potential subject may either suspect nonsmall cell lung cancer plan diagnostic biopsy , must histological cytological diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer . For suspected nonsmall cell lung cancer , histological confirmation must obtain prior commence treatment protocol . During phase II portion protocol , subject ask undergo FNA/core biopsy primary tumor correlative study even already come screen prior biopsy ( histological confirmation disease ) . However , subject refuse repeat FNA/core biopsy exclude protocol entry Subjects must stage IB , IIA , IIIA . T stage must define CT PET image . Nodal status must determine CT/PET imaging , N2 disease must confirm mandatory mediastinoscopy Subjects must chemotherapy radiation therapy naïve No history prior malignancy except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , adequately treated cervical carcinoma situ . Age great 18 year . Zubrod performance status 0 1 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500 platelet great equal 100,000/ml total bilirubin within normal institutional limit hemoglobin great 8.0 g/dl AST ALT Alkaline Phosphatase must within range allow eligibility . Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR Calculated creatinine clearance great equal 60 ml/min . Female subject child bear potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , treatment least 3 month thereafter . Women child bear potential must document negative pregnancy associate ßHCG screen . Predicted postresection FEV1 1.0 L Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . Subjects must receive plan receive investigational agent . Patients history severe hypersensitivity reaction docetaxel drug formulate polysorbate 80 . History know allergy compound similar chemical biologic composition bortezomib agent use study ( i.e . Boron , Mannitol ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , congestive heart failure myocardial infarction within precede 6 month , symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia , unstable angina pectoris , psychiatric illness social situation would limit compliance study prescribe therapy . Because patient immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive patient exclude study . Pregnant nursing woman Peripheral neuropathy : great grade 1 Inclusion Women Minorities Both men woman ethnic group eligible trial meet eligibility criterion . To date , information suggest difference drug metabolism disease response would expect one group compare another . All effort make accrue representative sample . If difference outcome appear associate gender ethnicity , perhaps followup study design investigate difference fully . The catchment 's area USC Los Angeles County .</criteria>
