	<brief_summary>Joint space aseptic area , mean contain microorganism . Any injury joint space could cause entry microorganism , potential cause infection . Septic arthritis refers infection joint space microorganism , usually bacteria . This invasion initiate process inflammation cause irreversible damage joint cavity . Patients typically present pain , swell , decreased motion , inability use joint . When bacteria enter joint space , host immune system respond concentrate inflammatory cell within joint . While inflammatory cell serve eliminate bacteria , also produce substance attack bacteria also could destroy joint space . These substance call enzyme , could damage cartilage ( translucent fairly elastic tissue around joint ) adjacent bone process . Because cartilage poor ability cure , process may lead irreversible damage chronic joint dysfunction . Studies find sign early joint damage find within hour follow joint infection . This true even antibiotic therapy ( medicine fight infection ) start within 24 hour infection . Also , delay treatment related poor outcome . However , best method treat septic arthritis yet determine . Currently , two accept way treat septic arthritis : serial needle aspiration ( introduce needle joint aspirate inflammatory liquid ) , surgical lavage ( open clean joint space OR anesthesia ) . Antibiotics also use two form treatment . Supporters surgery believe dependable method eliminate bacteria joint space arthrotomy ( open joint surgical incision ) lavage ( irrigation joint copious saline solution ) .Promoters serial needle aspiration support method quick , require open joint space , perform without anesthesia.At present , conclusive study compare two technique . Hopefully , study help delineate best course management .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The principle objectives justification study : To determine whether arthrotomy irrigation debridement repeat arthrocentesis provide clear benefit treatment septic arthritis adult . Background : Septic arthritis infection consequential inflammation joint space various microorganism . Typically bacterial origin result hematological seed direct invasion joint space . This invasion initiate cascade inflammation cause irreversible damage joint cavity . Patients typically present edema , erythema , substantial decrease range motion , inability use joint . It remain significant medical issue account 0.2-0.7 % hospital admission United States mortality rate range 2-14 % . Once bacteria enter joint space produce purulent fluid induces acute inflammatory response . The body 's inflammatory cell , although aid eradicate bacteria , produce enzymes also damage extracellular cartilage matrix , synovium , adjacent bone relatively short period time.1,2 Because adult cartilage poor regenerative capability , process lead irreversible damage chronic joint dysfunction.4 Studies find sign early joint damage find within hour follow joint infection.1 , 5 This true even antibiotic therapy start within 24 hour infection . Also , delay initiation treatment repeatedly find major determinant poor outcome.6 Thus , well accept early drainage purulent material addition antibiotic imperative prevent irreparable articular damage.4 However , best method yet determine . Currently study yet clearly provide ideal method management . Although animal model seem support early surgical intervention , retrospective study human reveal arthrocentesis may provide good outcome increase risk mortality.4,7,10 Proponents surgery believe proper visualization , debridement , lavage conduct surgery thus protect articular cartilage rapid destruction.8-10,12,13 Whereas proponent medical management argue needle aspiration quick , less invasive , conduct multiple time prevent accumulation pu follow effectiveness antibiotic treatment.7,11 Study Design : Randomized Prospective study . Selection Patients : We select 200 patient admit Grady septic arthritis ankle , knee , hip , wrist , elbow , shoulder . Inclusion criterion : - Patients acute onset symptom less equal two week ' duration . - Patients infection follow joint : ankle , knee , hip , wrist , elbow , shoulder - Patients prove bacterial infection positive gram stain culture synovial fluid white blood cell count synovial flood consistent infection ( 75,000 - 150,000 cells/mm3 . ) - Cases negative synovial fluid culture positive blood culture present associate typical inflammatory synovial fluid change without identifiable source infection antibiotic therapy initiate earlier explain negative synovial fluid culture . - Monoarticular arthritis Exclusion criterion - Gonococcal infection - Infected prosthetic joint - Adjacent osteomyelitis precede joint infection - Septic arthritis occur incidental event late course otherwise fatal illness - Patients 17 year old less . - Polyarticular arthritis . Methods : Definitive diagnosis septic arthritis make follow analysis joint fluid positive gram stain/culture white blood cell ( WBC ) count consistent infection ( 75,000-150,000 cells/mm3 ) discuss . Plain film involve joint acquire evaluate soft tissue edema , osteomyelitis , well rule pathological involvement . Patients ' blood sample also evaluate central blood count ( CBC ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , C- reactive protein ( CRP ) , culture . After patient admit treatment infect joint , ask participate study . The nature study explain member orthopaedic department , sign consent obtain prior inclusion study . Method Randomization : There two indistinguishable seal envelope create begin study patient enrol . Inside one envelope piece paper Group I write . Inside envelope piece paper Group II write . Patients randomly place either group I receive arthrotomy irrigation debridement group II undergoing repeat arthrocentesis base upon envelope choose . Treatment Method Group I : Patients undergo surgical treatment undergo surgery first 72 hour . During procedure , direct visualization joint cavity , thorough debridement adhesion necrotic tissue , irrigation-drainage saline solution eliminate much debris possible . Synovectomy perform . Temporary drainage catheter insert joint 48 hour . Treatment Method Group II : The second group undergo daily bedside arthrocentesis . The involved joint prepped drape sterile fashion prior every aspiration . As much infect joint fluid remove possible . Each aspirate fluid evaluate gross appearance , cell count , gram stain culture , glucose concentration , crystal analysis . Arthrocentesis perform daily effusion resolve aspirate long yield purulent exudate . After Treatment Method : Appropriate antibiotic provide group intravenously change oral pill upon discharge total course 14 day follow irrigation debridement final arthrocentesis . Also physical therapy pain medication provide patient . The affected joint initially immobilized position function . One infection control , range motion initiate slowly deliberately . Laboratory Findings : Patients ' blood sample also evaluate followed central blood count ( CBC ) , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) , c-reactive protein ( CRP ) daily hospital stay follow appointment . Method Follow : Patients follow 2 week , 2 month , 6 month post discharge . At follow-up appointment , patient evaluate symptomatic improvement well examine residual edema , range motion , recurrence infection , radiological change , erythema . Sample size calculation : A sample size 100 patient per group achieve 94 % statistical power detect difference 20 % null hypothesis 90 % surgery aspiration group clear infection within 2 month alternative hypothesis proportion aspiration group clear infection 70 % use two-sided Z test continuity correction unpooled variance ( significance level 0.05 ) . All power calculation perform PASS 2005 software . This calculation perform Kirk Easley , Senior Associate Biostatistics Department , Rollins School Public Health . Outcome Measures : Outcome divide four group : Good : patient recover completely without decrease range motion experience minimal residual pain . Fair : decrease ROM 10 % , moderate pain , sign recurrence Poor : great 10 % decrease ROM , &gt; 10 degree flexion deformity , ankylosis , osteomyelitis , persistent effusion , and/or severe disable pain . Death : Patients die reason course joint infection End point study would absence infection need additional procedure infection control ( i.e . secondary surgical lavage ) . Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) , Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment ( MFA ) , Western Ontario McMaster Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) questionnaires also use assess outcome follow-up appointment . The data collect Excel spreadsheet analyze determine one treatment option significantly improve outcome . Statistical analysis achieve use Fisher 's exact test . A P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . This study expect cause additional risk patient form treatment accepted standard treatment use nationally . References : 1 .
