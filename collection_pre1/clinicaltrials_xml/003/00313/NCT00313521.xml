	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , thiotepa , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well thiotepa work together radiation therapy treat young patient newly diagnose malignant brain tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thiotepa Radiation Therapy Treating Young Patients With Newly Diagnosed Malignant Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine tumor response adjuvant thiotepa follow radiotherapy pediatric patient newly diagnose malignant astrocytic tumor . Secondary - Determine acute chronic toxicity thiotepa patient . - Determine variability thiotepa metabolism measure plasma cerebrospinal fluid pharmacokinetics thiotepa tepa patient . - Develop phase II study framework model , determine chemosensitivity new , single-agent regimen treatment high-grade ( malignant ) astrocytic tumor , include anaplastic astrocytoma , glioblastoma , giant cell glioblastoma , gliosarcoma . - Determine incidence distant neuraxial metastasis patient time relapse . - Determine 1-year disease-free survival rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratified age ( 3-15 v 16-20 year age ) . - Chemotherapy : Patients receive thiotepa IV continuously 168 hour day 1-7 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course . Patients proceed radiotherapy blood count recover . - Radiotherapy : Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , approximately 6 week . - Post-radiation chemotherapy : Patients complete , partial , objective response , stable disease 2 course thiotepa may receive thiotepa alone 8 course discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
