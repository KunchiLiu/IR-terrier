	<brief_summary>Connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF ) know fibrogenic cytokine , could express various fibrosis disease . But , recent research show CTGF also consider tumor suppressive gene . The expression CTGF protein high normal Type I II alveolar epithelial cell metastatic tumor cell . CTGF appear suppressor lung tumor invasion metastasis decrease CTGF expression tumor tissue associate advanced tumor stage , lymph node metastasis , early postoperative relapse shorter patient survival . CTGF express many human organ heart , brain , placenta , liver , muscle , kidney , peritoneal mesothelial cell lung know pleura . The CTGF protein present peritoneal cavity increase peritonitis . Considering pleural cavity come origin mesenchyma peritoneum , pericardium fallopian tube , aim evaluate whether CTGF expression increase pleurisy patient include parapneumonic effusion TB pleurisy . The diagnosis TB pleurisy depend effusion TB culture pleural biopsy . Unfortunately sensitivity TB culture 20-30 % . So patient must receive invasive pleural biopsy . Adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) develop screen test consider alternative test culture biopsy . The sensitivity ADA might vary 32 % -100 % cutoff value also vary 26 70 IU/L . We develop method alternate culture biopsy . Therefore , technologist Jao-Jia chu develop CTGF ELISA kit specific aim . If CGTF might increase expression pleuritis decrease pleural metastasis , might potential method help differentiate lymphocytic pleural effusion TB pleurisy malignancy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Connective tissue growth factor ( CTGF , also know CCN2 ) member CCN family . Cysteine-rich 61 ( Cyr61 ) know CCN1 , nephroblastoma over-expressed ( Nov , know CCN3 ) well Wisp-1/elm1 ( CCN4 ) , Wisp-2/rCop1 ( CCN5 ) , Wisp-3 ( CCN6 ) 1 . The CTGF secretory growth factor bind integrins cell surface first identify mitogen isolated medium human umbilical vein endothelial cells2 . CTGF express many human organ heart , brain , placenta , liver , muscle , kidney , lung may many biologic functions3 . CTGF stimulate proliferation fibroblast vascular endothelial cell . The level CTGF protein increase patient various fibrotic human disease include renal failure , hepatic fibrosis biliary atresia , systemic scleroderma vascular atherosclerosis4 . Recent research reveal expression CTGF protein high normal lung epithelium moderate high stage I lung adenocarcinoma cells5 . But expression CTGF reduce low grade metastatic respiratory epithelial tumor cell . The CTGF expression associate suppression human lung cancer cell metastasis mouse model reduce CTGF expression also associate clinical metastasis patient survival5 . The expression CTGF protein statistically significantly high normal lung type I II epithelial cell majority metastatic adenocarcinoma specimen reveal level CTGF protein decrease clinical disease cell acquire ability grow metastatic site6 . CTGF appear suppressor lung tumor invasion metastasis decrease CTGF expression tumor tissue associate advanced tumor stage , lymph node metastasis , early postoperative relapse , short patient survival . Connective tissue growth factor act independent prognostic marker colorectal cancer giomas inhibits metastasis7,8</detailed_description>
