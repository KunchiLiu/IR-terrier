	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Oral Platinum Agent Satraplatin Combination With Weekly Docetaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : Satraplatin oral platinum analog currently evaluate combination prednisone phase III clinical trial patient HRPC progress follow one prior chemotherapy regimen . Docetaxel taxane indicate treatment patient non-small cell lung , breast , prostate cancer . Specifically , recently approve combination prednisone treatment patient hormone refractory prostate cancer ( HRPC ) . Docetaxel administer every 3 week associate survival advantage versus mitoxantrone . Docetaxel administer weekly show improvement survival versus mitoxantrone statistically significant . However , well tolerate docetaxel administer every 3 week , significantly less grade 3 4 toxicity , especially neutropenia . The combination satraplatin weekly docetaxel may feasible regimen patient chemotherapy-naïve HRPC patient malignancy medication show activity . OBJECTIVE : The objective study determine optimum dos satraplatin weekly docetaxel 2 drug give combination .</detailed_description>
