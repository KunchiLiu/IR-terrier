	<brief_summary>This Phase II , open-label study male patient metastatic HRPC . Each cycle 21 day ( 3 week ) . Patients receive follow drug : - Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV give 1 hour Day 1 . - Prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily begin Day 1 continue disease progression . - Sargramostim 250 mcg/m2 SC Days 2-15 cycle . Patients evaluate every 4 cycle ( 12 week ) response use RECIST criterion . PSA response evaluate accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) PSA Working Group Criteria . To evaluate safety drug combination , patient evaluate clinic visit adverse event . Toxicities assess per National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) CTCAE Version 3.0 . Those patient achieve stable disease well continue therapy . Those patient experience progressive disease take study . Patients receive maximum 10 cycle treatment .</brief_summary>
