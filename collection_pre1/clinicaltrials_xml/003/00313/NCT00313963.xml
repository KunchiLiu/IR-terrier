	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease group complex , chronic disorder characterize hemolysis , acute vaso-occlusive episode ( crisis ) , unpredictable acute complication life-threatening , variable development chronic organ damage . Administration magnesium sulfate potential reduce hemolysis since induces negatively charge chloride ion water entry cell . To date one non-randomized , non-blinded , single arm study 19 child evaluated effect magnesium length stay hospital child sickle cell disease . In randomized , double blind , two-arm placebo control study , child sickle cell disease admit vaso-occlusive crisis receive intravenous magnesium sulfate placebo every 8 hour stay hospital , along pain management . We measure length stay ( LOS ) , pain , adverse effect , total amount narcotic require pain control .</detailed_description>
