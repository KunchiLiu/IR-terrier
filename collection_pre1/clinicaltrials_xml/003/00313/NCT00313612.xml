	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give oxaliplatin together topotecan work treat patient ovarian epithelial cancer , primary peritoneal cancer , fallopian tube cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin topotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate overall clinical response rate ( complete partial response ) patient previously treat ovarian epithelial , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer treat oxaliplatin topotecan . II . Determine toxic effect patient treat regimen . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate time progression overall clinical response duration patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord response prior platinum therapy ( resistant v sensitive ) . Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 15 topotecan IV continuously day 1-14 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
