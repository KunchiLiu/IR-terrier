	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study azacitidine without entinostat see well work compare azacitidine alone treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , acute myeloid leukemia . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Entinostat may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving azacitidine together entinostat may work well treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia , acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine With Without Entinostat Treating Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes , Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia , Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall response rate ( complete , partial , hematologic improvement-major International Working Group [ IWG ] criterion ) response azacitidine entinostat . II . To estimate major response rate ( complete partial response IWG response criterion ) 10-day regimen azacitidine regimen azacitidine combination entinostat administer orally day 3 10 cycle patient de novo myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ( CMMoL ) ( dysplastic ) acute myeloid leukemia trilineage dysplasia ( AML-TLD ) , well patient treatment-induced MDS , CMMoL ( dysplastic ) AML-TLD . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity azacitidine entinostat patient population . II . To identify change gene promoter methylation gene expression may associate response azacitidine entinostat . III . To identify molecular mechanism ( deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] damage ) may associate response azacitidine entinostat . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) day 1-10 . ARM B : Patients receive azacitidine Arm A entinostat orally ( PO ) day 3 10 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 6-24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
