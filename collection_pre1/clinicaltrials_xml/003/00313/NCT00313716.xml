	<brief_title>Effects Erythropoietin Cerebral Vascular Dysfunction Anemia Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) cause spectrum cerebrovascular dysfunction , range impaired pressure autoregulation severe global ischemia ( inadequate blood flow ) . Pressure autoregulation ability organ maintain constant blood flow despite change perfusion pressure . Impaired pressure autoregulation cause TBI patient vulnerable secondary ischemic attack . Erythropoietin ( Epo ) substance normally make kidney stimulates production red blood cell . It usually give patient treat anemia . Scientists recently discover Epo also make brain injury . In animal model TBI , brain 's production Epo numerous protective effect , include reduce inflammation brain , reduce death brain cell , improve blood flow brain . In laboratory , effect naturally-occurring , protective agent enhance give additional amount intravenously . Because Epo may beneficial effect injure brain anemia , scientist study effect give Epo patient severe TBI . The primary objective randomize , placebo-controlled study determine effect early administration recombinant human Epo ( rhEpo ) , long-term neurological outcome patient severe TBI . The researcher also examine effect rhEpo administration cerebrovascular system , hemoglobin concentration , brain oxygenation , need blood transfusion , systemic complication . This study consist 2 part : 1 ) treatment phase , 2 ) monitoring phase . In treatment phase , participant randomly assign 1 4 group : low high dose rhEPO treatment group low high dose placebo group ( control group ) . All aspect treatment acute post-injury phase follow standard treatment protocol individual severe TBI . Generally treatment phase last 1-2 week amount time require patient receive treatment TBIs ICU ( intensive care unit ) . The monitoring part study ( include record information test perform part standard TBI treatment , well additional test perform especially study ) last 6 month TBI . Information learn study may lead knowledge whether rhEpo improve outcomes TBI optimal hemoglobin concentration maintain patient TBI .</detailed_description>
