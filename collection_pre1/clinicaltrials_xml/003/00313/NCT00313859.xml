	<brief_title>Phase II Study Simvastatin Plus Irinotecan , Fluorouracil , Leucovorin ( FOLFIRI ) Metastatic CRC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Progress treatment metastatic CRC undoubtedly achieve past decade . Until 1985 , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) agent available treatment metastatic CRC . Several trial attempt enhance activity bolus 5-FU , addition levamisole interferon . Despite attempt , survival advantage establish introduction newer cytotoxic drug . The addition folinic acid ( FA ) 5-FU , use infusional rather bolus 5-FU , combination new active agent irinotecan oxaliplatin 5-FU/FA resulted increase activity 5-FU . In trial current combination regimens first-line therapy , response rate exceed 30 % median survival duration longer 16 month report . In , despite rapid advance treatment metastatic CRC last decade , efficacy treatment still need improved . One potential way increase survival metastatic CRC patient introduction novel target agent standard cytotoxic regimen IFL ( irinotecan , fluorouracil , leucovorin ) . An increasingly recognize molecular target anticancer treatment rate-limiting enzyme mevalonate pathway , 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase . The end product mevalonate pathway require number essential cellular function sterols membrane integrity , ubiquinone cell respiration , geranylgeranyl isoprenoids covalent binding ras family , dolichol glycoprotein synthesis , isopentenyladenine tRNA function protein synthesis . Fortunately , inhibitor key enzyme , statin , well establish use safely clinic treatment hypercholesterolemia decade . Therefore , HMG-CoA reductase may decent molecular target anti-cancer therapy statin may readily applicable clinic potential role anticancer drug establish . The statin recently gain attraction medical oncologist large retrospective analysis efficacy trial statin coronary artery disease show agent able reduce cardiac disease-related mortality , cancer incidence also reduce 28 - 33 % . In , clinical trial investigate combine standard treatment novel molecular target agent , statin , definitely warrant .</detailed_description>
