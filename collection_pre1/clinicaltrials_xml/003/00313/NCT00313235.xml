	<brief_title>Combined Modality Treatment Patients With Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A novel dendritic cell vaccine develop Baylor Institute Immunology Research . Pre-clinical study find dendritic cell vaccine efficient induce tumor specific immunity dendritic cell vaccine . Further study BIIR do dendritic cell load kill melanoma cell melanoma cell line treat heat loading . Both study show DCs manufacture novel way efficient prim melanoma specific CD8+ cell . Our previous study indicate portion patient stage IV melanoma mount immune response tumor antigen present dendritic cell . Also , regulatory/suppressor T cell identify blood patient , may account lack induction T cell immunity dendritic cell vaccine . Cyclophosphamide treatments improved antitumor immunity human melanoma clear relationship cyclophosphamide dosage suppressor cell activity document . Therefore , trial test combine modality treatment , use dendritic cell base vaccine patient treat cyclophosphamide . This clinical trial evaluate cyclophosphamide/dendritic cell vaccine patient Stage IV melanoma . The trial accrue total 33 subject . The primary goal trial test safety/tolerability/feasibility combine modality rate objective clinical response.However feasibility data first 10 subject demonstrate need adjust dose CPA , new dose test next 10 subject thereby extend accrual 43 subject . A 15 % objective response rate accept patient stage IV Melanoma . Patients receive cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 , administer 24 hour prior DC vaccination # 1 , 3 , 5 , 6 7 . Each subject initially receive 7 dos vaccination individual dose administer week 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 14 18 . A clinical evaluation patient do week 10 &amp; 20 . Patients progressive disease take study . Patients SD , PR CD ( accord RECIST criterion ) may receive 4 vaccination . Scans re-staging test perform schedule interval throughout study .</detailed_description>
