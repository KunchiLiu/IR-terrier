	<brief_summary>This propose phase II trial investigate combination irinotecan , carboplatin bevacizumab along radiation treatment patient limited-stage SCLC . This study differ `` maintenance '' bevacizumab trial bevacizumab begin initial chemotherapy treatment . Irinotecan/platinum regimens emerge standard treatment patient extensive-stage disease . Adding novel minimally toxic agent regimen front may enhance doublet 's efficacy without contribute toxicity . This trial one first clinical trial evaluate combination target therapy chemotherapy front treatment common solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible patient receive 4 course irinotecan , carboplatin , bevacizumab . Radiation therapy begin concurrently third course systemic treatment . The interval chemotherapy course 28 days.Patients completely restaged approximately 2 week completion chemotherapy prior begin treatment maintenance bevacizumab . Those progressive tumor serious toxicity come study . Those stable disease objective tumor response continue treatment restaging every 12 week minimum 6 cycle ( 6 month ) . - Induction chemotherapy regimen Irinotecan : 60mg/m2 IV day 1 , 8 , 15 Carboplatin : AUC=4 day 1 Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV day 1 , 15 Cycles repeat every 28 day four course - Radiation therapy 1.8 Gy , single daily fraction , concurrently third course chemotherapy e total dose 61.2 Gy ( 34 fraction ) . Patients obtain complete remission near complete remission also receive prophylactic whole brain radiotherapy , give within one month therapy complete ( total dose 24Gy 2Gy daily fraction ) . - Maintenance Bevacizumab Bevacizumab alone dose 10 mg/kg IV day 1 15 cycle , maximum 6 additional cycle ( 6 month ) restaging every 12 week .</detailed_description>
