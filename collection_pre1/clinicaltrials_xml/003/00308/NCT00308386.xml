	<brief_summary>Although strong clinical evidence exist patient diabetes achieve certain clinical goal ( i.e . HbA1C , BP , LDL , etc . ) , reduce morbidity mortality national survey indicate minority people diabetes achieves goal . Hypothesis : combination nurse case management enhance behavior change counsel improve outcome glycemic control , blood pressure cholesterol high risk patient Type 2 diabetes compare usual care 3 year period . Study design- The study three year randomize control trial select patient either A1C &gt; 8.5 , LDL &gt; 130 , BP &gt; 140/90 . Nurse case manager , train clinical guideline brief behavior change counsel technique ( motivational interviewing ) , aim foster patient adherence experimental group patient . Nurse case manager use stand order set implementation clinical guideline ( diabetes , hypertension , hyperlipidemia depression ) individual follow . A total 820 patient 9 ( 6 Hershey Medical Center 3 Reading Hospital affiliate clinic ) seek . One third study patient recruit underserved Hispanic population Reading area . Patients randomized physician i.e . one physician randomly assign patient co-managed nurse case manager ; usual care without contact nurse case manager . Nurses train initiate small pilot study July thru August . Full recruitment initiation study begin September 2006 . Clinic Activities - Each nurse responsible 3 clinic . Nurses work supervision primary care physician . A set clinical guideline develop physician input serve over-riding framework nurse . Outcomes - Over three-year period investigator evaluate clinical response ( improvement A1C , BP , LDL , depression present ) well series measure obtain survey ( patient satisfaction , quality life , self-management behavior ) . Provider satisfaction measure use standardized tool . Finally , cost effectiveness intervention evaluation potential barrier implementation study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>DYNAMIC Study : ( Diabetes Nurse Case Management And Motivational Interviewing Change )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Rationale : Diabetes mellitus prevalent disease result high health care expenditures , majority due preventable complication diabetes . Current evidence indicates care patient diabetes mellitus fall short standard set American Diabetes Association large proportion patient achieve treatment goal . Multiple way deliver care patient diabetes study . The investigator propose 3 year randomized-controlled study assess impact combination nurse case management ( NCM ) combine enhanced behavior change counsel glycemic control co-morbidity outcome high-risk patient Type 2 diabetes compare usual care 2 . Key Objectives : Specific Aim 1 . Determine efficacy enhance nurse case management ( NCM ) intervention promote patient adherence lead positive clinical outcome ( HbA1C , LDL , blood pressure , process measure ) high-risk patient primary care period three year . High-risk patient Type 2 diabetes recruit 9 primary care clinic randomize NCM intervention vs. usual care . A major focus proposal test efficacy NCM minority population high risk poor outcome ( approximately 38 % study population Hispanic ) . The investigator anticipate significant increase percentage patient reach goal HbA1C ( &lt; 7.0 % ) , BP ( &lt; 130/80 ) , LDL ( &lt; 100 mg/dl ) patient NCM group compare control group usual care . The investigator also hypothesize significant improvement process measure ( % patient yearly dilate eye exam , foot exam , urinary screen microalbuminuria , aspirin use , lipid evaluation ) depression score patient NCM group compare control group usual care . Specific Aim 2 . Quantify impact enhanced nurse case management health-related quality life , patient satisfaction , self-management behavior , provider satisfaction . A unique feature study address impact intervention critical outcome , address exist NCM literature . The investigator anticipate improve adherence , low level diabetes specific emotional distress , high level diabetes specific quality life , increase patient satisfaction treatment , improve provider satisfaction NCM group compare usual care group . The following survey complete analysed : PAID survey look Emotional distress associate diabetes , ADDQOL ( Diabetes specific quality life ) survey , DTSQ ( Patient satisfaction ) survey SDSCA ( Diabetes self care activity ) survey . Specific Aim 3 . Evaluate cost-effectiveness enriched NCM intervention . The investigator expect NCM intervention effective improve clinical outcome patient type 2 diabetes ; however , may still barriers widespread adoption unless benefit invest reimburse NCM justified cost . Toward end , investigator evaluate cost-effectiveness intervention perspective provider , payor , society . These cost-effectiveness ratio help decision maker generate inform decision appropriate cost-effective treatment high-risk patient type 2 diabetes . 3 . Study Population : Patients Type 2 diabetes , old 18 year age , identify base billing data ( two visit ICD-9 code 250.xx precede year ) subsequent chart review nine Hershey Medical Center ( HMC ) primary care clinic three Reading Hospital-affiliated primary care site . 4 . Major Inclusion Criteria : Inclusion criterion : Type 2 diabetes , age &gt; 18 high risk base one follow criterion : HbA1C &gt; 8.5 , LDL &gt; 130 , BP &gt; 140/90 . 5 . Allocation Groups : stratify group randomization scheme whereby patient see doctor randomized treatment group . The randomization also stratify clinic site size doctor 's practice . One group see nurse care manager , continue standard care . 6 . Summary Procedures : An initial pilot study perform 60 patient HMC Reading Hospital clinic , 2 month . This consist nurse case management intervention feedback subject improve study design . Subjects see 2 , 4 , 6 8 week . This study end focus group subject give input like study , might improve . Pilot participant option enroll main study . No study order research purpose . Pregnancy screen occur verbally ask subject whether believe could pregnant , since risk minimal . The main study enroll 820 subject clinic Hershey Medical Center Reading Hospital , 2/3 subject enrol HMC , 1/3 underserved Hispanic population . The study intervention continue 3 year . Patients enrol nurse case management group control group dependent upon see physician - randomization occur block base clinic physician , randomly per patient . In main study , intervention group patient initial appointment nurse case manager ( RN ) ( 50 min ) review medical history , medication control diabetes co-morbidities . A plan patient specific treatment goal set appointment . The patient follow appointment set 2,4 , 6 week review progress , obtain standard diabetes laboratory make necessary medication adjustment . The patient see nurse case manager average every 2-3 month , minimum every 6 month , depend diabetes control . They also continue see PCP ( schedule per PCP , normally every 3-4 month ) . The control group patient continue follow PCP schedule , change usual care . The patient group ask complete 4 questionnaire ( 5 depress ) assess emotional stress diabetes , quality life treatment satisfaction baseline yearly study duration ( 3 year ) . Subjects randomly audio tap ensure nurse case manager follow recommend guideline research . Study outcomes HbA1c , lipid , blood pressure evaluate baseline yearly patient . No laboratory do specifically research purpose . The data extract Penn State Diabetes Center Registry chart ( require ) . For cost analysis , investigator track outpatient inpatient cost Hershey Medical Center Reading hospital . In addition , investigator track hospitalization cost outside hospital obtain record exist registry manage State Pennsylvania ( Pennsylvania Health Cost Containment Council ) , identify social security number . This information along information study safeguard strict confidentiality . 7 . Major Risks &amp; Discomforts : 1 . Loss confidentiality . 2. increase risk low blood sugar improve glycemic control , therefore patient ask test glucose regular basis - 2 -5 time daily , depend diabetes regimen . They 24-hour contact phone number , specific primary care clinic , call problem arise . 8 . Confidentiality : All research record , include subject Reading clinic , cod kept HMC . All consent form forward HMC . Records , audio tape code key keep Endocrinology office lock file accessible investigator . 9 . Study Site Location ( ) : University Physician Health Groups ( UPHG ) make 10 practice site . For purpose project 6 10 HMC practice site participate 3 Reading Hospital-affiliated ambulatory site . All 3 site own The Reading Hospital Medical Center , non-profit hospital health care organization .</detailed_description>
