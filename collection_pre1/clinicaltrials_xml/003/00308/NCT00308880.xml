	<brief_summary>Tranexamic acid belongs fibrinolytic inhibitor . Several prospective randomize clinical trial prove effectiveness reduce intra-operative post-operative bleeding orthopedic cardiovascular surgery . However , little study tranexamic acid reduce post-operative bleed head neck surgery . So aim study investigate tranexamic acid could reduce post-operative bleeding via prospective double-blinded randomize clinic trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Otolaryngologists often use drainage tube head neck surgery reduce hematoma seroma formation . In addition , duration drainage tube placement closely related length hospital stay . So early removal drainage tube could eventually shorten admission period . The factor related duration drainage tube placement include : type surgery , intra-operative bleeding , underlie disease coagulation disorder , etc . According literature , average duration drainage head neck surgery 4 day . Another study show one risk factor associate surgical site infection longer drainage duration . Therefore , remove drainage tube soon possible crucial head neck surgeon.Tranexamic acid belongs fibrinolytic inhibitor . Several prospective randomize clinical trial prove effectiveness reduce intra-operative post-operative bleeding orthopedic cardiovascular surgery . However , little study tranexamic acid reduce post-operative bleed head neck surgery . So aim study investigate tranexamic acid could reduce post-operative bleeding via prospective double-blinded randomize clinic trial.This study include 60 consecutive patient undergo head neck surgery . Those allergy tranexamic acid , history coagulation disorder , anti-coagulation therapy exclude . Basic data record along detail physical examination operation type . Then divide randomly study group control group . Study group receive tranexamic acid operation control group . PT , APTT , level prothrombin fragment 1+2 , D-dimers , plasminogen , Î±2-antiplasmin , tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , plasminogen activator inhibitor ( PAI-1 ) obtain operation . The drainage amount , duration drainage tube placement also record . Relevant variable collect analyzed .</detailed_description>
