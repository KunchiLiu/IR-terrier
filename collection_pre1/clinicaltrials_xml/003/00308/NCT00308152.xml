	<detailed_description>Outpatient colonoscopy generally well-tolerated elective procedure . Colonoscopy completion rate govern part patient comfort , enhance adequate sedation . In addition , comfort follow colonoscopy determines timely recovery procedure return usual activity . Colonoscopy sedation frequently accompany hypotension ( systolic blood pressure le 100 mm Hg ) , reduce amount sedation able employ . Where apparent , blood pressure restore infusion intravenous normal saline . We observe hypotension relatively common may present shortly commencement procedure , suggest many patient undergo colonoscopy reduce blood volume . Therefore , prophylactic infusion normal saline may enhance colonoscopy completion rate , patient comfort colonoscopy recovery colonoscopy . We propose randomise consent adult patient attend outpatient colonoscopy one two treatment arm : ( ) A control arm , standard sedation monitoring colonoscopy , infusion normal saline systolic BP â‰¤ 95 mmHg 3 minute ( two observation period ) completion procedure ; ( ii ) A treatment arm , pre-hydration infusion 1.0 litre normal saline immediately prior colonoscopy . Outcome measure include colonoscopy completion rate , hypotension colonoscopy , patient rating comfort satisfaction .</detailed_description>
