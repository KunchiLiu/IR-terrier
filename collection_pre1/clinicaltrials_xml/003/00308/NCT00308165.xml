	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety efficacy chemotherapeutic drug ( topotecan ) give directly brain tumor delivery technique call convection-enhanced delivery . This drug use different type cancer , study give experimental delivery technique design maximize amount drug deliver brain tumor minimize side effect part body . This study also evaluate advanced magnetic resonance ( MR ) image technique . The study ass quality life parameter throughout follow-up period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study Intracerebral Topotecan Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical efficacy chemotherapy discourage malignant brain tumor , mostly side effect delivery limitation . Because locally invasive rarely metastasize , malignant glioma feature make uniquely amenable new strategy regional drug delivery . Intracerebral clysis ( convection-enhanced delivery ) novel drug delivery strategy use microinfusion pump establish pressure gradient brain via implanted catheter . The pressure gradient produce convective force distribute therapeutic agent throughout tumor surround brain tissue . Non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method monitor drug distribution treatment response develop maximize clinical application minimize complication associate treatment risk . Study participant take operate room 2 catheter surgically place tumor surround tumor bed . These catheter connect small infusion pump slowly infuse topotecan continuously 4-5 day . Patients daily MRI scan hospital . Upon completion experimental treatment , patient discharge followed outpatient clinic .</detailed_description>
