	<brief_summary>The purpose study describe incidence recall awareness anesthesia child age 5-15 collect anesthetic post-operative follow-up data relate intra-operative recall general anesthesia . The hypothesis implementation routine awareness follow-up evaluation child undergo general anesthesia identify incidence intra-operative awareness child equal great adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Awareness , unwanted recall intra-operative event occur general anesthesia , potentially avoidable anesthetic complication pose risk psychological sequela . While report incidence 0.1-0.2 % adult , translates &gt; 20,000 case awareness occur adult annually United States ( Ekman , 2004 ; Myles , 2000 ; Sandin , 2000 ; Sebel , 2004 ; Myles , 2004 ) . Patients experience recall may subsequently exhibit post-traumatic stress psychological symptom ( Sebel , 2004 ; Myles , 2004 ; Moerman , 1993 ; Lennmarken , 2002 ) . Furthermore ; study show 54 % adult patient worry possibility awareness surgery ( Klafta , 1996 ) . Subsequent recent study unintended intraoperative awareness publish data impact Bispectral Index prevent detect anesthesia awareness , Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organizations classify intraoperative awareness sentinel event ( 2004 ) . Limited data available regard incidence consequence awareness child . Studies available identify significantly high incidence intraoperative recall child show adult . McKie report incidence 5 % factual recall 202 patient age 7-14 year 1973 ( 1973 ) . The incidence dreaming report 11 % . Hobbs , 1988 , report 19 % incidence dream awareness 120 pediatric patient receive `` Liverpool anesthetic technique '' ( N20 , O2 , relaxant ) . Ranta report 0.4 % awareness 4800 patient age 12 year old , young patient demonstrate undisputed awareness 20 year age ( 1998 ) . More recently , Lopez et . al. , find 8 % incidence awareness child 6-16 year age , significant relationship multiple attempt secure airway likelihood awareness ( 2004 ) . Most recently , study publish 2005 Davidson , et . al. , find incidence 0.8 % 864 child age 5-12 year age general anesthesia practice Australia . Likely explanation frequent awareness child include alter anesthetic pharmacology child difference practice pediatric anesthesia . Post-operative behavior change include emergence delirium , general anxiety , nighttime cry , enuresis , separation anxiety temper tantrum describe occur 50 % child undergoing surgery ( Kain , 1996 ) . Studies also show correlation pre-operative anxiety level child parent , may result great risk emergence delirium later maladaptive behavior . These result demonstrate cause-effect relationship ( Kain , 2004 ) . Evaluating intra-operative awareness unwanted recall intra-operative event without depth anesthesia monitoring , may add knowledge base causal factor postoperative maladaptive behavior change pediatric population . The JCAHO Sentinel Event Alert , Issue 32 , date October 6 , 2004 , describe recommendation health care organization perform procedure general anesthesia , prevention detection intra-operative awareness . Specific recommendation include : identification patient high risk intraoperative awareness , appropriate follow-up patient , include child , undergone general anesthesia , identification , management , appropriate , referral patient experience awareness . Since little data exists incidence identification intra-operative awareness child , multi-center , prospective , observational , cohort evaluation conduct describe evaluate incidence awareness routine general anesthetic practice child . Following IRB approve informed consent ( assent appropriate ) , child sequentially enrol participate study . Participating institution share de-identified data enrol pediatric patient undergo general anesthesia . Each center collect maintain patient data compliance privacy institutional guideline .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Children 515 year age schedule surgical procedure require general anesthesia . Children able respond answer postoperative followup question 3 time interval post anesthesia : prior discharge postoperative recovery area ( within first 24 hour follow surgery clinically indicate ) , 3 ( + 1 ) day 14 ( + 2 ) day postoperatively . Ability speak understand English . Anticipated length general anesthesia least 30 minute . Children known cognitive neurologic impairment , psychiatric illness developmental delay consistent inability accurately adequately respond answer postoperative followup recall question relate anesthesia experience . Expectation child remain endotracheally intubate beyond 24 hour postoperatively . Anticipated use ketamine anesthetic management . Children surgery general anesthesia within past 6 month anticipate child require additional surgery within 14 day study followup time period .</criteria>
