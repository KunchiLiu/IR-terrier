	<brief_summary>Purpose : To compare incidence post-surgery complication evaluate relevant parameter within 28 day operation HES ( 130/0.4 ) albumin treat group Study Design : Open-label , active control , parallel group , randomize , multi-center study . Per protocol , 624 patient require 6 study center . Hypothesis : No difference rate postoperative ( post-op ) complication HES albumin group</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effect Hydroxyethyl Starch ( HES ) Complications Patients After Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Since application surgical operation , postoperative complication area surgeon explore . Though surgical technological advance make possible patient recover operation , prevention management postoperative complication still important surgeon . Traditionally , level albumin important marker prognosis patient . When level albumin 35 g/L , mortality rate complication increase significantly , albumin become widely use colloid liquid fluid therapy postoperative patient . Actually , body utilize exogenous albumin take 6-7 day body synthesize new albumin . There dispute concern whether albumin use postoperative treatment severely ill patient . The well-known SAFE study find difference efficacy albumin crystalloids severe patient 28-day observation time . A meta analysis 24 study involve 1419 patient come conclusion administration albumin could increase mortality rate patient . The high price albumin another target extensive criticism . On hand , maintain colloid osmotic pressure certain level circulatory system essential postoperative patient stabilize hemodynamics , reduce tissue edema , improve recovery , beneficial patient replace albumin Voluven ( 130/0.4 ) . Voluven ( 130/0.4 ) medium-molecular-weight hydroxyethyl starch produce Fresenius Kabi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd , widely use clinically volume replacement therapy . Its efficacy safety prove clinical practice , however , effect patient postoperative complication clear . The study compare effect Voluven ( 130/0.4 ) albumin occurrence postoperative complication patient abdominal operation provide guidance selection safe economic volume replacement therapy postoperative patient . STUDY OBJECTIVES To compare effect Voluven ( 130/0.4 ) albumin occurrence postoperative complication patient abdominal surgery day operation 28th day operation .</detailed_description>
