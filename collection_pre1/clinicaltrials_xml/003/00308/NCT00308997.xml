	<brief_title>Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation `` Voices ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia severely disable brain disorder affect 1 % United States population . Approximately 50 80 % people schizophrenia experience `` voice , '' also know auditory hallucination . These hallucination consist spoken speech , sometimes replicate speaking voice familiar person , sometimes reflect speaking voice know becomes highly recognizable . The phrase sentence express `` voice '' often highly disruptive , may comment , cajole , criticize , , case , command patient . They often invariably distress , disrupt one 's ability interact others , work , study , sleep . In 25 % case , medication treatment either completely ineffective partially effective relieve `` voice . '' Effective treatment alternative need improve trouble often disable symptom . Recent study suggest auditory hallucination arise part brain ordinarily involve perceive actual speak speech . Low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) , technique us electromagnet induce reduction cortical brain activity , may therefore effective quiet auditory hallucination . The potential usefulness approach demonstrate previous study conduct medical center . This new study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) locate two area brain involve speech perception . These area Wernicke 's area leave superior temporal gyrus , right hemisphere analogous site superior temporal gyrus . Repetitive TMS specifically position reduce cortical excitability reactivity two brain region . Participants double blind study randomly assign receive either real rTMS , placebo stimulation , feel similar real rTMS produce direct brain effect . Depending group assignment , participation may last 4 8 week . Over first 2 week , participant undergo two sequence rTMS , consist five 16-minute session . One sequence direct leave Wernicke 's area sequence direct right-sided equivalent area . During third week , participant receive five additional session leave right site appear produce great clinical improvement . All participant inform whether receive real placebo stimulation . Participants receive real stimulation offer 5 additional stimulation session brain site achieve best response . Participants receive placebo stimulation offer real stimulation twenty session 4 week use schedule describe . Assessments severity hallucination clinical symptom conduct every fifth rTMS session clinician know whether participant receive real placebo stimulation . Neuropsychological testing also do , , trial . Our previous trial demonstrate improvement verbal processing significant impairment term memory , language cognitive function . However , insofar trial involve great total `` dose '' rTMS , careful monitoring function conduct throughout trial . In addition , study determine degree improvement obtain course trial sustain ensuing month . This accomplished via on-going monthly contact study participant 1 year last rTMS stimulation session .</detailed_description>
