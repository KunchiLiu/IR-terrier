	<detailed_description>End-stage liver disease one major disease lead death . With advancement transplantation surgery perioperative anesthesia management , liver transplantation become effective method recover patient ' liver function , thus save life improve quality life . Serious disorder fluid balance , blood coagulation dysfunction , electrolyte disequilibrium , hypoalbuminaemia , low hematocrit , low hemoglobin acid-base imbalance etc . exist end stage cirrhosis patient liver transplantation . Such abnormality internal milieu could cause worsen cardiovascular pulmonary dysfunction , thus make perioperative management difficult . Albumin blood plasma conventionally use plasma volume expanders clinical practice . At time , level albumin concentration also use important criterion prognosis . When level albumin concentration serum 35 g/L , postoperative mortality rate complication increase significantly . In fact , focus debate many year whether albumin use volume replacement critically ill patient . Boldt colleague demonstrate albumin little positive influence prognosis critically ill patient . However , Shwe deem albumin beneficial critically ill patient . Simon suggest albumin give mainly treat hypovolemia instead increase level albumin concentration serum . However , time , admit advantage albumin comparison colloid solution , furthermore , expensive . Voluven ( 130/0.4 ) medium molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch ( HES ) produce Beijing Fresenius Kabi Pharmaceutical Co. , Ltd . It novel HES preparation optimize molecular weight molecule distribution , low degree substitution ( DS ) ( 0.4 ) , narrow molecular distribution profile ( C2/C6 ) available HES specification make suitable volume replacement therapy . Some study reveal Voluven ( 130/0.4 ) comparable efficacy HAES-steril ( average molecular weight 200.000 dalton , degree substitution 0.5 ) . Because improved pharmacological profile , Voluven ( 130/0.4 ) use avoid capillary vessel leakage improve oxygenation tissue . In addition , Voluven ( 130/0.4 ) accumulate plasma tissue even multiple dose ( maximal dose 50 ml/kg ) , improved HES safety profile term coagulation kidney function . The current study design assess efficacy , safety , pharmaceutical economics characteristic perioperative volume replacement Voluven ( 130/0.4 ) patient undergo liver transplantation compare patient receive volume therapy albumin . The objective study supply appropriate regimen patient undergo liver transplantation , consider clinical efficacy , safety , cost .</detailed_description>
