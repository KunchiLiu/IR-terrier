	<brief_summary>It hypothesize inhalation sodium pyruvate reduce lung damage patient Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) ability reduce level toxic reactive oxygen nitrogen compound associate chronic inflammatory component disease . The primary objective study assess safety inhale sodium pyruvate 0.9 % sodium chloride ( saline ) solution people CF . Further , determine whether inhaled sodium pyruvate improve lung function , determine spirometry , reduce inflammatory marker induce sputum people CF .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) common , lethal inherited disease Caucasians . Approximately 30,000 people United States 70,000 worldwide diagnosis CF . It cause mutation cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( CFTR ) gene . The clinical manifestation characteristic CF include progressive bronchiectatic lung disease thick mucus production colonization Pseudomonas aeruginosa . The CFTR gene mutation result alter cell transport property , affect chloride glutathione secretion . Chronic inflammation , associate activate neutrophil macrophage , common feature CF . Highly reactive toxic oxygen ( superoxide anion , free hydroxyl radical , hydrogen peroxide ) nitrogen specie ( nitric oxide , peroxynitrites ) abundant chronic inflammatory response CF appear play prominent role pathogenesis disease . These reactive oxygen nitrogen specie show directly toxic various mammalian tissue , include lung , via DNA damage cell membrane lipid peroxidation . In addition , elevate level hydrogen peroxide nitric oxide demonstrate sputum bronchoalveolar lavage fluid patient CF , asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Clearly reactive oxygen nitrogen specie implicate pathogenesis variety lung diseases include CF . Sodium pyruvate antagonist reactive oxygen nitrogen specie . It also potential increase intracellular level thiol compound , major source intracellular anti-oxidants . Sodium pyruvate show act anti-inflammatory agent reduce number infiltrate neutrophils level oxygen radical wind site , thereby limit production pro-inflammatory mediator . Thus , hypothesize inhalation sodium pyruvate reduce lung damage patient CF ability reduce level toxic reactive oxygen nitrogen specie associate chronic inflammatory component disease . The trial Phase I Safety Study conduct three Stages . The study design assess safety administer sodium pyruvate inhalation therapy CF subject day one day , twice day one day , finally , twice day four week . All testing , include screen visit Stage 1 , Stages 2 3 , conduct University Minnesota ( UMN ) General Clinical Research Center GCRC ) . Stage 1 - Single dose inhalation - 24 hour ( n=15 ) Participants CF receive single dose sodium pyruvate ( 5 ml physiological saline ) via Pari-Jet hand-held nebulizer ( Pari LC PlusÂ® nebulizer system ) , follow UMN GRC four hour follow telephone interview 24 hour . Three concentration ( 0.5 mM , 1.5 mM , 5.0 mM ) sodium pyruvate solution study . Five subject receive low concentration sodium pyruvate solution ; another five subject receive middle dose sodium pyruvate solution ; finally third group five subject receive high dose sodium pyruvate solution . Patients enrol Stage 1 one 6-hour visit UMN GCRC . Following administration single 5-mL dose either 0.5 mM , 1.5 mM , 5.0 mM sodium pyruvate 0.9 % saline solution , follow test perform : Post Inhalation Study Drug Spirometry : - Post inhalation 0.5 Hr - Post inhalation 1 Hr - Post inhalation 2 Hr - Post inhalation 4 Hr Sputum Induction : - Post inhalation 1 Hr SaO2 : - Post inhalation 0.5 Hr - Post inhalation 1 Hr - Post inhalation 2 Hr - Post inhalation 4 Hr End Visit . Blood Urine Analysis - Post inhalation 4 Hr Electrocardiogram - Post inhalation 4 Hr Vital Signs - Post inhalation 4 Hr The parameter safety monitor include spirometry , vital sign , ECG , SaO2 , routine blood urine analysis , conduct pre- post- inhalation sodium pyruvate . Follow telephone interview also conduct stage . With regard efficacy , spirometry , induce sputum sample monitor pre- post- inhalation sodium pyruvate . Induced sputum sample evaluate cellular content ( total WBC differential ) fluid content assess total protein , total DNA , elastase , glutathione ( GSH GSSG ) , H2O2 inflammatory cytokine ( IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , TNF-alpha ) .</detailed_description>
