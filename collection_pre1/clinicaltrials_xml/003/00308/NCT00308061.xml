	<detailed_description>The study randomize , control trial participant clinical investigator blind vaccine group assignment . Forty adult randomize 1:1 ratio receive either FMP1/AS02A control rabies vaccine . The aim control group account baseline morbidity impact seasonal malaria transmission dynamic anti-MSP-1 antibody , minimize bias assessment adverse event . Vaccines give 0- , 1- 2-month schedule . The first immunization give early July malaria transmission begin ; second dose end July transmission increase ; third dose late August near peak malaria transmission intensity . Study day 90 October , shortly transmission crest severe uncomplicated malaria disease episodes peak , study day 180 end malaria season , study day 272 height dry season . The final study follow-up day 364 coincide beginning 2004 malaria season . Interim safety analysis review independent Safety Monitoring Committee second third immunization .</detailed_description>
