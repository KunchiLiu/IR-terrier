	<brief_title>Study Photodynamic Therapy Patients With Prostate Cancer Following Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer lead cause morbidity mortality men around world . Because worldwide increase life expectancy , dramatic increase number patient prostate cancer expect . It estimate year 2002 , 92,000 men 65 year age diagnose annually European community , prostate cancer account 12 % new male cancer diagnosis . Consequently , radiation therapy use extensively primary therapy prostatic carcinoma . The Management Report clinically localized prostate cancer National Cancer Institute SEER program indicate 30 % patient choose radiation therapy first treatment option . However , ability radiation therapy totally permanently eradicate prostatic cancer come question recently result high number patient post radiotherapy elevate prostatic specific antigen ( PSA ) determination ( 85 % ) , high positive post irradiation biopsy rate ( 31 90 % ) . With high local recurrence rate possibly influence death rate , recurrence prostate cancer potentially curative local therapy become significant urological problem . As patient treated prostate cancer young age , significant number ultimately fail primary treatment candidate safe potentially curative salvage therapy . High complication morbidity rate associate current salvage therapy demand new improve mean eradicate recurrent local disease . Photodynamic therapy , allow destruction tumor IV administration photosensitizer local application light , may provide mean . Transperineal interstitial photodynamic therapy minimally invasive procedure treat select patient fail radiation therapy prostate cancer . A preliminary phase 1 study use photosensitizer meso-tetrahydroxyphenyl chlorine ( mTHPC ) 14 patient indicated PDT could produce necrosis prostate involve cancer recur radiotherapy , low incidence complication .</detailed_description>
