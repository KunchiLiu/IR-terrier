	<brief_title>Foot Posture People With Paralysis One Side After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim study : 1 . Describe foot posture individual hemiplegia follow stroke use quantitative navicular drop test . 2 . Determine difference people normal , hypotonic , hypertonic foot posture regard ankle range motion , ankle strength , gait , balance . This observational design study describe relationship variable . Measurements include descriptive quantitative measure . Thirty subject stroke participate one session test include : clinical assessment foot posture use descriptive classification system , quantitative measurement navicular drop standing , measurement ankle range motion , ankle strength , gait ( low extremity biomechanics forceplate analysis ) , static dynamic balance . A chi-square test use determine goodness fit classification descriptive system quantitative measurement . Independent one-way ANOVAs use determine mean difference foot posture group dependent variable .</detailed_description>
