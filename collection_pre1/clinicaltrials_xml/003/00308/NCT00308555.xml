	<brief_summary>We conduct study ass whether smoke marijuana affect safety prescribe opioids patient treat chronic pain . This study ass whether smoke cannabis affect absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion widely use opioid analgesic . We propose investigate effect smoke cannabis subject prescribe morphine oxycodone chronic pain . We also assess clinical safety cannabinoids opioids monitor short-term side effect associate combined therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Opioid Cannabinoid Pharmacokinetic Interactions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain condition remain problematic , especially patient cancer . Although opioids effective analgesic , dose-limiting side effect form sedation , nausea vomiting , fear dependence often limit use high - possibly effective - dos . Of particular interest , however , potential great additive analgesic effect cannabinoids opioids combination would allow opioid analgesic effect achieve low dosage necessary alone , could overcome problem tolerance side effect drug class . Unfortunately , safety data combination human exist time need obtain . As increase number patient chronic pain may turn cannabis augment effect opioid analgesic , data potential pharmacokinetic interaction clinical safety combination evaluate controlled clinical research setting .</detailed_description>
