	<brief_summary>Summary : Chloroquine medication laboratory setting significant anti-HIV effect HIV infect T-cells . Chloroquine use safely 60 year malaria treatment prevention , also significant anti-inflammatory effect . No formal study chloroquine perform people HIV infection . Chloroquine use worldwide quite inexpensive outside United States . If show effective , chloroquine could important tool worldwide delay HIV disease progression would extend time period without need anti-retroviral therapy . In country anti-retroviral therapy available , could helpful . This 8 week trial study require 3 study visit . Participants ask take day study medication ( chloroquine placebo ) 8 week three blood draw CD4 count , HIV viral load , research test . The visit study enrollment , 4 week , 8 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Summary : A phase I randomize , double-blind , placebo control trial investigate efficacy chloroquine decrease T-cell activation decrease viral load early HIV . Scientific Rationale : Chloroquine vivo direct anti-HIV effect anti-inflammatory effect . These property may beneficial reduce viral burden immune activation therefore delay HIV disease progression . Sample Size : 25 Length Study : 8 week , [ enrollment + 2 follow visit ] . Intervention : - Arm 1a : Chloroquine 250mg orally daily 8 week . - Arm 1b : Chloroquine 500mg orally daily 8 week . - Arm 2 : Placebo daily 8 week . Measurements : - Blood draws week : 0 , 4 , 8 week . - CD4 , viral load measurement communicate refer provider ( subject consent ) .</detailed_description>
