	<brief_summary>Patients cystic fibrosis ( CF ) must perform daily bronchial drainage therapy ( BD ) keep airway clear secretion . Many different technique available achieve currently agreement form therapy effective . High frequency chest wall oscillation ( HFCWO use purpose CF patient throughout United States abroad . To perform therapy , patient wear vest fit entire torso connect air compressor . The compressor generate oscillate air pulse transmit lung , thereby mobilize secretion . The oscillation produce commonly use device sinusoidal wave form ( The Vestâ„¢ Airway Clearance System , Hill-Rom Inc , St Paul , MN ) . Previous study indicate form therapy effective traditional cumbersome form therapy . The design pulse generator recently modify oscillation produce triangular wave form ( Respitech Inc , MN ) . Studies do University Minnesota find air flow induce airway vary substantially depend wave form apply chest . At present , impact use triangular wave form mucus removal unknown . The propose study compare mucous clearance use device generate sine wave oscillation device generate triangular wave oscillation . Hypothesis : Bronchial drainage use triangular wave form HFCWO result superior sputum production compare HFCWO use sine wave form . Secondary Hypotheses : Bronchial drainage use triangular wave form HFCWO may result sputum rheologic property distinct sputum produce use sine wave HFCWO . Bronchial drainage use triangular wave form HFCWO may result superior post-therapy pulmonary function test compare pulmonary function test obtain follow therapy sine wave HFCWO . Subjects perceive bronchial drainage use triangular wave form HFCWO comfortable airway clearance use sine wave HFCWO .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participation study 4 day . During initial subject recruitment , investigator review inclusion exclusion criterion potential subject . Upon enrollment , qualify subject ask perform last BD day 8 PM day , allow continue rest routine therapeutic regimen ( include aerosol ) . They instruct come day 1 study 8 AM . During visit , complete brief questionnaire undergo abbreviate physical exam , concentrate chest finding . The questionnaire exam use confirm subject meet study inclusion exclusion criterion . The current therapeutic regimen follow day one study review patient ask make change study period . Subjects perform pulse oximetry , spirometry , lung volume via body plethysmography . A sputum specimen collect rheologic study special container . Once complete , patient perform 30 minute BD session accord first treatment randomly allocate sequence . The vest , jacket , worn subject differs sine wave triangular wave device . Subjects blind type system use session . Blinding accomplish patient wear eye blind type use commercially assist sleep . Investigators assist patient put HFCWO device . A large , lightweight poncho place patient head , thereby conceal vest attached equipment . The blind remove patient subsequently put set ear protector use commercially worker noise exposure . This prevent patient recognize difference sound produce two device . Only respiratory therapist supervise session know treatment assignment . It possible subject able differentiate two device despite measure blind treatment . Subjects use vest device provide investigator rather bring vest device home . Prior initiate study , device test , adjust necessary , ensure `` dial '' pressure frequencies accurately deliver . During session sputum produce collect pre-weighed special container seal immediate processing . Patients use routine combination aerosol conjunction BD session . At end 30 minute session patient ask produce second sputum specimen collect rheologic study special container . After complete , pulmonary function measurement repeat . The patient undergo abbreviate physical exam complete brief questionnaire ( included application ) . The 8-item survey instrument focus adverse effect comfort associate use HFCWO device , primarily use 5-point scale . Responses experience use device compare use standard statistical methodology . The patient discharge measurement complete ask return 3 day later second treatment allocate sequence . The patient ask continue interim daily routine , try make major change physical activity , environmental exposure fluid intake . For second treatment , patient instruct perform BD 8 PM even return appointment . On second visit , subject undergo routine follow first visit . Sputum Measurements All sputum patient produce therapy session collect pre-weighed specimen container seal immediately . After specimen weigh ( 'raw wet weight ' ) , specimen centrifuge 27,000 g 15 minute 4oC supernatant carefully completely discard . This step eliminate fluid come saliva may contaminate specimen . The container sputum pellet weigh ( 'wet weight ' ) leave open oven temperature set 150o F 3 day allow complete desiccation . After , container weigh determine sputum 'dry weight ' . The 'raw wet weight ' specimen collect end session rheologic study record dry weight calculate extrapolation 'wet weight ' 'dry weight ' obtain large specimen . The addition weight two specimen give total sputum production session . Pulmonary function test Patients perform spirometry lung volume determination body plethysmography baseline end BD session . At time , oxygen saturation determine earlobe pulse oxymetry . Forced vital capacity ( FVC ) Forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) obtain spirometry result ; patient perform single-breath nitrogen washout . All test perform follow technique already standard pediatric pulmonary laboratory follow strict American Thoracic Society guideline . All result express percent predict age , gender height . Sputum Rheologic Properties The specimen collect end session weigh frozen immediately -70oC . The sample send later Dr. Bruce Rubin , Wake Forest University , Winston-Salem NC study . E. Data Analysis . Primary outcome : For patient sputum production treatment period determine record total 'wet ' sputum weight obtain treatment period . Sputum weight average treatment arm obtain mean 'wet ' sputum production treatment , analyze analysis variance difference mean . The sputum dry weight analyze similarly . Secondary outcome : Percent change calculate FVC , FEV1 , Single-breath nitrogen washout see patient give treatment period . The mean percent change calculate treatment difference analyze analysis variance . The procedure follow rheologic measure .</detailed_description>
