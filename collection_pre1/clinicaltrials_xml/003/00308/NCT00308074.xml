	<detailed_description>Study Design : Fifteen patient DSM-IV diagnosis Autism , Asperger 's Disorder Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified ( PDD NOS ) enrol 12-week open-label study . Parents potential subject preliminary phone screen , follow clinical evaluation psychiatrist possible inclusion study . Informed write consent assent obtain parent subject respectively deem competent initiation study procedure . Clinical Evaluation use Autism Diagnostic Interview ( ADI-R ) Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) establish formal diagnosis . Study Procedures Baseline Assessments : Many baseline measure physical health do screen visit first weekly visit . These include clinical interview , physical neurological examination do screening period height , weight vital sign , calculation his/her Body Mass Index ( BMI ) do screen period first weekly visit . Laboratory measure baseline study completion include complete metabolic panel ( liver transaminase ) complete blood count differential . Further measure include fast lipid profile , hemoglobin A1C , prolactin level insulin level , fast blood sugar level ( FBS ) . Serum albumin measure measure nutritional state , also accordance fact aripiprazole 99 % protein-bound . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) perform begin end study monitor possible cardiac effect . These measure aim monitoring side effect report use medication class . Urine pregnancy test perform female subject begin end study . Outcome measure include Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( Y-BOCS ) , Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale child ( BPRS-C ) , Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI-S ) , Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale ( VABS ) Atypical Children 's Development Scale ( ACDS ) . Baseline parameter extrapyramidal side effect establish use Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) , Simpson Angus Extrapyramidal Side Effect Scale ( SAEPS ) Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale . Baseline value general side effect compile use Monitoring Side Effects System ( MOSES ) . Weekly visit : At visit , patient undergo clinical interview , vital sign , weight measure . Custodial guardian ( ) provide collateral information . The weekly `` short '' visit occur week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 12 . They 45 minute duration . Ongoing outcome measure perform visit 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 11 . The visit 1-1.5 hour duration . The measure do include short visit , well Y-BOCS , BPRS , ABC CGI-S. Side effect monitor use AIMS , SAEPS , Barnes Akathisia Scale MOSES visit . Termination Visit : The last visit ( Visit 13 earlier patient drop study ) include repetition measure visit 1 ( except ADI-R ) last 2 hour . All baseline laboratory measure repeat time . Follow-Up Patient Care : After completion clinical trial , patient follow Cambridge Health Alliance ( CHA ) Center Child Adolescent Development refer back original psychiatric provider appropriate treatment provider community . Medication dosing : Aripiprazole start 2.5mg 5mg depend clinical impression severity especially aggression agitation . At weekly visit , dose adjust 5mg increment accord clinical impression .

The dose reduce 67 % initial dose 3 day 33 % initial dose 3 day medication ( ) discontinue . The subject remain enrollment medication 5 half life aripiprazole initiate . Anticonvulsant medication take seizure control may continue throughout trial long subject stable dose 30 day prior study seizure free 6 month . These medication dos hold stable throughout trial . Adverse Events : Any serious adverse event lead hospitalization lead study discontinuation . Any event require concomitant medication ( ) also lead discontinuation . Adverse event report Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) event require medical attention , score 3 high MOSES scale .
