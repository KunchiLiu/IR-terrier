	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate efficacy tolerability PD P 506 A-PDT relate commonly use cryosurgery treatment mild moderate AK lesion locate head . To able quantify effect patient allocate one three treatment : PD P 506 A-PDT , cryosurgery placebo-PDT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PD P 506 A-PDT Versus Placebo-PDT Cryosurgery Treatment AK</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Actinic keratosis ( AK ) pre-cancerous skin abnormality usually cause sun exposure . Actinic keratoses occur commonly fair skin , especially elderly . They mainly occur sun-exposed skin area like head hand . It standard care remove AK diagnose , achieve either physical ablation , chemotherapeutic agent photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . In Europe , cryosurgery method primarily use therefore serve comparator therapy PD P 506 A-PDT . A placebo control necessary validate test system . While comparison PD P 506 A-PDT cryosurgery open comparison , placebo-PDT PD P 506 A-PDT allocate double-blind manner .</detailed_description>
