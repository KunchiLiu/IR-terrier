	<brief_summary>Bone marrow failure syndrome ( BMFS ) rare disorder characterize dysfunctional hematopoietic stem cell , give rise red white blood cell . The deficiency blood cell , cytopenia , cause malfunction lead assortment disease disorder , characterize BMFS . Because disease rare , conduct research difficult , standard treatment BMFS yet develop . This study collect clinical laboratory data people BMFS identify characteristic biological marker associate disease time . This information assist doctor researcher develop good therapy diagnostic test help improve management BMFS cytopenia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identifying Characteristics Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BMFS result hematopoietic progenitor stem cell failure within bone marrow . Specific cause problem , however , difficult identify , BMFS occur sporadically . For reason , study conduct find disease develop appropriate effective therapy . Aplastic anemia ( AA ) common BMFS . Other type BMFS include follow : myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) ; paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria ( PNH ) ; pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) ; amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ATP ) ; large granular lymphocyte leukemia ( LGL leukemia ) . Though AA common BMFS , BMFS closely related term symptoms characteristic . This study collect clinical laboratory data people BMFS identify characteristic biological marker specific disease evolve . This information assist doctor researcher devise good therapy diagnostic test help improve management BMFS cytopenia . Participants observational study report study site initial screen visit , follow study visit every 6 month least 5 year . At visit , participant interview examined physician . Laboratory test , include blood collection bone marrow aspirate , also perform . Data collect study 's database use determine prevalence clinical event laboratory abnormality course disease , study evolution disease parameter symptom , evaluate current therapy diagnostic test .</detailed_description>
