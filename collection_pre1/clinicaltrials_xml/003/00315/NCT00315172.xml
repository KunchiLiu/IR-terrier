	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Volunteers qualify meet following criterion : 1 . Good general health . Individuals take medication serious medical condition exclude . 2 . Age 7 11 year . 3 . Body Mass Index 15th 85th percentile lean child great equal 95 % age overweight child . 4 . Prepubertal ( breast Tanner I III girl , testis size less equal 10 mL boy ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Volunteers exclude follow reason : 1 . Presence major illness : renal , hepatic , gastrointestinal , endocrinologic ( e.g. , Cushing syndrome , untreated hyper hypothyroidism ) , hematological problem pulmonary disorder . 2 . Taking medication might interfere weight growth oral steroid , psychotropic agent . 3 . Presence movement tic disorder , since condition increase involuntary movement may interfere measurement NEAT . 4 . Individuals take and/or take stimulant weight loss medication last 6 month . 5 .
