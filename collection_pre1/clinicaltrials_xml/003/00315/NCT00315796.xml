	<brief_summary>Pain common difficult problem patient cancer . It report 80 % cancer patient suffer pain . Much pain iatrogenic related procedure . Dr. Grossman recently demonstrate patient undergo bone marrow biopsy poor pain control procedure . Treatment pain almost entirely analgesic medication , principally opioids . These medication numerous undesirable effect sedation , confusion , hypotension constipation limit efficacy utility . Drs . Diette , Lechtzin , Rubin colleague recently demonstrate use nature sight sound ( NSS ) , simple , safe , inexpensive intervention , decrease pain fiberoptic bronchoscopy , procedure commonly perform diagnose cancer detect pulmonary complication cancer therapy . Patients randomly assign either standard care intravenous narcotic benzodiazepine standard care coupled view nature scene use nature sound , , bronchoscopy . The group assign NSS report significantly good pain control control group . While finding novel exciting , raise several new question suggest logical extension work . It know whether intervention apply patient setting , know whether comparison standard care appropriate control group . Further , mechanism action NSS need determine . NSS may simply form distraction therapy may property . The theory biophilia propose specific element nature imagery exert beneficial health effect . Because NSS appear promising safe intervention treatment pain , investigator plan perform controlled clinical trial cancer patient undergo invasive procedure . Patients randomly assign one three arm , standard care , NSS , non-nature base distraction technique . We study efficacy NSS management procedure-related pain oncology patient . The finding provide necessary background information develop definitive study NSS competitive external funding . This exciting study help develop harmless , inexpensive method treat pain cancer patient , may complement replace analgesic medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nature Sights Sounds Reduce Pain Cancer Patients Undergoing Bone Marrow Aspiration Biopsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : This randomize , control trial assess impact nature sight sound ( NSS ) pain control oncology outpatient undergo bone marrow aspirate biopsy ( BMBx ) Weinberg Cancer Center Johns Hopkins . One hundred twenty patient assign one three group : 1 ) standard care , 2 ) NSS , 3 ) Music/Photo . The primary outcome pain score procedure measure Hopkins Pain Rating Instrument ( HPRI ) . Patients group receive analgesic medication dictate personnel perform procedure physician responsible clinical care . Patients NSS group Bedscapes nature scene mural place bedside location visible throughout procedure . They also listen complementary audiotape procedure . The music/photo group listen city sound procedure view poster city skyline . Setting : The study conduct Weinberg Cancer Pavilion Kimmel Cancer Center Johns Hopkins Hospital . Patient Selection : All patient 18 year old diagnosis cancer undergo BMBx Johns Hopkins Oncology Center screen enrollment study . Informed Consent : The study design consent procedure explain prospective patient . If patient interested take part study , write informed consent obtain . The study nurse administer mental status exam ass eligibility . Consent screening must occur within 5 day patient 's procedure . Randomization : Blocked randomization use variable block size ensure roughly equal number patient study arm . Study Interventions : All subject pain managed physician responsible clinical care dictate physician . Subjects assign NSS Bedscapes fabric panel depict scene mountain stream place procedure table location visible throughout procedure . An accompany audiotape complementary nature sound played portable tape player headphones speaker . They instruct listen tape look nature scene frequently long desire . The standard care group pain manage accord current oncology center protocol allow use distraction intervention . The Music/Photo group play tape typical city sound poster city skyline place procedure table . The city skyline poster similar size Bedscapes mural . The skyline image daytime photograph without water , tree nature element . The subject ask listen music view picture procedure . The HPRI use measure pain . This plastic VAS slide marker move within grove . The side face patient appear like traditional VAS . It 10cm line anchor `` No Pain '' `` Worst Pain Imaginable '' . The opposite side instrument 10 cm scale marking every 0.5cm enables clinician read record numerical value ( see figure appendix ) . Scores record near 0.5cm . All patient baseline assessment pain immediately prior procedure . Subjects interview within one hour follow procedure ask quantify pain procedure.Patients also complete questionnaire follow procedure score level pain control procedure 5-point Likert scale , use bronchoscopy study . Data Collection : Following procedure patient complete set questionnaire . Questions inquire attitude , belief prior use CAM . Patients NSS , Music/Photo group ask whether find study intervention helpful aspect intervention beneficial . They ask rate satisfaction several aspect procedure include comfort , nursing care , physician care , facility . Psychological distress measure Brief Symptom Index 18 , negative mood state anxiety measure Profile Mood States ( POMS ) . The BSI provide global symptom severity score use control subject ' underlying psychological distress , POMS well suit measure change mood related procedure . We specifically focus Tension-Anxiety , Depression-Dejection , Anger-Hostility , Confusion-Bewilderment subscales . Differences response pain measure Pain Catastrophizing Scale . Salivary cortisol measure procedure neuroendocrine marker stress . Two baseline measurement cortisol take least 15 minute apart prior procedure . Immediately follow procedure three additional salivary cortisol sample collect approximately 15 minute apart . The study nurse record heart rate , blood pressure respiratory rate every 15 minute procedure . The high low systolic blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate extract . The study nurse record percentage time patient use study intervention procedure . Patients also ask percentage time use intervention . Outcomes : The primary outcome determine NSS effective reduce pain cancer patient undergo invasive procedure , compare mean pain score procedure HPRI NSS group standard care group . We also compare difference rating baseline pain pain procedure two group rating pain control procedure group . We also determine NSS reduces pain non-nature base distraction therapy compare pain rating , difference pain rating baseline procedure NSS music/photo group . Lastly determine NSS reduces affective distress cancer patient undergo painful procedure compare mean score POMS three group . Secondary outcome pertain specific aim include vital sign procedure salivary cortisol level . We also assess overall satisfaction care , rating physician , rating nurse , attitude towards CAM intervention use Likert-type scale . Sample Size : The primary outcome difference maximal pain level procedure NSS group Music/Photo group . Power estimate base magnitude effect bronchoscopy study standard deviation pain rating bone marrow biopsy study Dr. Grossman . In order 80 % power detect 2-point difference pain rating use HPRI alpha error level 0.05 need 29 patient group ( total n=87 ) . We plan enroll 40 patient group ( total n=120 ) compensate study withdrawal miss data . We continue enroll patient meet goal . Data Entry Management : The Biostatistics Core CAM center provide recommendation data entry analysis . Because small , single center trial relatively safe intervention formal data safety monitoring committee . However , Dr. Lechtzin oversee data integrity . Adverse Events Monitoring : This minimal risk intervention expect adverse event . During bronchoscopy study one adverse event ; patient become incontinent procedure table due sound run water . Adverse event experimental intervention assess interview follow procedure record voluntary complaint subject structure interview . Attention direct clinical adverse experience associate procedure experimental intervention . In addition , study participant provide telephone number contact 24 hours/day , 7 days/week case question , concern , adverse event . Adverse event document standardized case report form . Summary report adverse event generate every three month . Dr. Lechtzin review . All serious adverse event include death , hospitalization , premature withdrawal report principal investigator within 24 hour occurrence . The principal investigator report serious adverse event Johns Hopkins IRB . Unexpected adverse event report within 10 day . Statistical Analysis : Analyses base intention treat . Analyses perform compare patient use NSS standard care group Music/Photo group . Descriptive analysis perform assess subject characteristic ( demographic , disease characteristic , education , prior CAM use attitude ) . Procedure characteristic compare include duration , complication , medication usage . Continuous variable represent mean plus minus SE , median interquartile range . Bivariate analyse outcome compare pain rating , POMS subscales , psychological distress group . Chi square test Fisher 's Exact test use compare categorical variable age , gender , race group . Unpaired t-tests Kruskal Wallis test use compare continuous outcome Pain Inventory score . Pain score analyze continuous variable also categorize mild ( 0-2 ) , moderate ( 3-6 ) severe ( 7-10 ) . Multivariate analysis perform order adjust possible confound factor amount narcotic analgesic give amount local anesthetic use . Ordinal logistic regression model explain pain level study intervention develop adjust factor age , gender , race , procedure type , education level , local anesthetic dose , narcotic dose , benzodiazepine dose , BSI score . Additional factor include model significant bivariate analysis . Logistic regression model develop determine factor associate favorable response NSS . Stepwise maximum-likelihood ratio estimation significance level 0.2 removal 0.1 inclusion assist model development . For analysis significance set p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
