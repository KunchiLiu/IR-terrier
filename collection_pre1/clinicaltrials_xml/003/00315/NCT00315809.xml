	<brief_summary>The purpose study see new method use determine Multidrug Therapy ( MDT ) , use cure leprosy patient effectively twenty year , effective Leprosy Philippines . Researchers know people get infect leprosy cause disease relapse cure adequate MDT . Blood , skin scraping , nasal swab biopsy , collect leprosy patient perform test related detection disease germ . The test use find bacteria body related bacteria find patient contact . This help researcher know bacteria come , see spread . Other test perform see bacteria kill two common medicine give leprosy patient . Study participant include individual age 18 old present Leonard Wood Memorial diagnosis and/or relapse leprosy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall objective study understand factor lead continued incidence leprosy Philippines novel molecular methodology use combination retrospective prospective sampling approach . The overall objective include : ( 1 ) strain type M. leprae isolates obtain new relapsed leprosy patient Philippines identify cluster transmission pattern combine conventional epidemiological criterion ; ( 2 ) determine viability M. leprae mRNA detection specimen collect new patient ; sign relapse ; ( 3 ) identify determine extent mutation confer resistance past circulate M. leprae isolates leprosy patient two Multidrug therapy ( MDT ) drug ; Dapsone Rifampicin ; ( 4 ) detect chain transmission endemic population retrospective analysis isolate sample bank combine strain type information new case conventional epidemiological criterion . The following outcome measure objective : ( 1 ) strain typing : identification genotype ; ( 2 ) percent sample patient contact contain viable M. leprae ( judge presence mRNA panel M. leprae gene ; ( 3 ) percent sample patient contact contain mutation M. leprae rpoB folP 1 gene identification new mutation associate relapse ; ( 4 ) identification match similar genotype new sample obtain patient household contact retrospective sample . Clinical specimen contain M. leprae bacillus skin biopsy , slit skin smear , nasal swabs blood require obtain M. leprae DNA meet objective study . Nasal swab use assess role nasal mucosa infection dissemination leprosy . The blood useful monitoring humoral response infection . Skin biopsy , slit skin smear , nasal swab blood obtain informed consenting patient . Enrollment sample collection procedure take approximately 1-2 hour . These procedure perform patient 's visit clinic diagnosis therapy leprosy . As part study , punch biopsy lesion collect enable sufficient quantity DNA extract strain typing , critical objective study . Patients required visit site 7-10 day assess biopsy site . This visit may take 30-60 minute . An epidemiology survey contain demographic clinical information obtain participant . Study participant prospective sample collection include volunteer consent individual , 18 year old , report Leonard Wood Memorial ( LWM ) CebuSkin Clinic , Leonard Wood Memorial Center Biomedical Research , Cebu , Philippines diagnosis leprosy and/or relapse leprosy .</detailed_description>
