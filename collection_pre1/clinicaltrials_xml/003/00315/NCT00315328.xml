	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To compare effectiveness weekend atropine plus near activity daily patch plus near activity moderate amblyopia ( 20/40 20/100 ) severe amblyopia ( 20/125 20/400 ) improve vision amblyopic eye 7 &lt; 13 year old . - To determine maximum improvement vision amblyopic eye treatment . - To determine whether amblyopia associate structural abnormality optic nerve fiber layer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Patching Versus Atropine Amblyopia 7 &lt; 13 Year Olds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although consensus amblyopia treat effectively young child , many eye care practitioner believe treatment beyond certain age ineffective . Some clinician believe treatment response unlikely age 6 7 year , others consider age 9 10 year upper age limit successful treatment . The American Academy Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern amblyopia recommend treatment age 10 year . The opinion amblyopia treatment ineffective old child may arise age 6 7 year think end `` critical period '' visual development human . This belief , however , base adequate prospectively-collected data . To address issue response amblyopia treatment child 7 year old , Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group ( PEDIG ) conduct randomized trial 507 patient ( age 7 &lt; 18 year ) amblyopic eye visual acuity range 20/40 20/400 . Patients provide optimal optical correction randomize Treatment Group ( 2 6 hour per day prescribe patch sound eye combine near visual activity patient plus atropine one drop per day sound eye 7 &lt; 13 year old ) Optical Correction Group ( optical correction alone ) . Patients whose amblyopic eye acuity improve 10 letter ( 2 line ) 24 week consider responder . In 7 &lt; 13 year old ( N=404 ) , 53 % Treatment Group responder compare 25 % Optical Correction Group ( P &lt; 0.001 ) . In 13 &lt; 18 year old ( N=103 ) , responder rate 25 % 23 % respectively overall ( adjust P=0.22 ) , 47 % 20 % respectively among patient previously treat patch and/or atropine amblyopia ( adjust P=0.03 ) . Most patient , include responder , leave residual visual acuity deficit . The use multiple modality ( patch , atropine , near visual activity ) treatment regimen 7 &lt; 13 year old trial ( ATS3 ) effort maximize therapeutic response . Patients age 13 year old prescribe patch atropine concern continual optical blur atropine could deleterious effect ability drive perform activity . Prescribed patch 2 6 hour day limit patch wear non-school hour prior study 3 &lt; 7 year old demonstrate little two hour patch day ( combine near visual activity ) effective great number hour . Instructing patient perform least one hour near activity wear patch base unproven clinical opinion near activity augment effect occlusion therapy . A PEDIG pilot study suggest near activity beneficial question benefit near activity currently study another randomized clinical trial . Atropine place sound eye day two day week demonstrate young child beneficial acuity amblyopic eye , presumably due cycloplegic effect blur vision sound eye especially near fixation . In study compare daily weekend atropine , daily atropine find superior . The unanswered question complete clinical trial whether prescribe patch atropine alone could produce response similar combination therapy , whether age group , one treatment better . A poll PEDIG investigator investigator meet January 15 , 2005 indicate follow treatment regimen use prior study ( ATS3 ) ; rather , prescribe monotherapy—either patch atropine—as initial treatment amblyopia 7 &lt; 13 year age range . Thus , trial compare atropine patch amblyopia treatment 7 &lt; 13 year old need . The study design simple trial , type amblyopia therapy determine randomization process , approximate standard clinical practice . The two treatment regime : 1 ) Atropine 1 % weekend day sound eye plus near activity least one hour every day without aid reading glass ( increase daily atropine 5 week acuity improve least 5 letter ) 2 ) Patching 2 hour per day plus near activity one hour patching ( increase 4 hour per day moderate amblyopes &gt; 4 hour per day severe amblyopes 5 week acuity improve least 5 letter ) . Optional Ancillary Study As part optic nerve image ancillary study , retinal nerve fiber layer image use optical coherence tomography perform patient . This optional patient participate site . The procedure part standard care . The subject 's pupil need dilate , already dilate part exam . Testing eye complete 15 minute .</detailed_description>
