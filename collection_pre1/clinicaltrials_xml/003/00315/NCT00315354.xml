	<detailed_description>For last half century , reduction fat intake primary nutritional approach prevention treatment obesity cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Over last year , low carbohydrate ( Atkins-type ) diet achieved great popularity , publication several study suggest great weight loss improvement CVD risk factor 3 6 month . Recently , third dietary approach focus glycemic index ( GI ) generate interest . However , study compare effect diet body weight regulation risk CVD . The primary hypothesis study diet lower postprandial rise blood glucose ( very-low-carbohydrate low-GI ) beneficial effect physiological adaptation weight loss CVD risk factor . However , CVD risk factor adversely affect very-low-carbohydrate vs. low-GI diet . Preliminary data provide strong support hypothesis , show rest energy expenditure decline less CVD risk factor improve weight loss low-glycemic load diet compare conventional low-fat diet . This application propose cross-over feed design study effect three diet follow 12.5 % weight loss obese young adult subject ( n = 24 , age 18 40 year ) . The diet : 1 ) conventional low-fat , 60 % carb , 20 % fat , 20 % protein ; 2 ) low-GI 40 % carb , 40 % fat , 20 % protein ; 3 ) very-low-carbohydrate 10 % carb , 60 % fat , 30 % protein . The primary outcome rest energy expenditure ( indirect calorimetry ) . Secondary outcome include total energy expenditure ( doubly label water ) , thermic effect food ( indirect calorimetry ) , physical activity ( accelerometry ) , insulin resistance B-cell function ( frequently-sampled OGTT ) , blood lipid , blood pressure measure systemic inflammation coagulopathy . This study major public health implication million Americans currently follow diet decrease body weight risk heart disease .</detailed_description>
