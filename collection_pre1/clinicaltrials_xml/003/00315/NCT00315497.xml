	<brief_title>Determining Disease Activity Biomarkers Individuals With Giant Cell Arteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GCA rare autoimmune disorder common type inflammation medium- large-sized blood vessel body . It usually occur old adult . The common symptom GCA include headache , pain shoulder hip ( polymyalgia rheumatica ) , pain jaw ( jaw claudication ) , fever , blur vision . Organ-specific marker injury damage well direct marker vascular damage inflammation currently use clinician assess GCA disease progression ; however , marker useful guide treatment . There also blood test clinician use monitor GCA activity , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , test lack specificity sensitivity . Most treatment available GCA toxic , therefore marker indicate disease activity find , may lead development less toxic treatment . This study use new scientific method identify new biomarkers use monitor disease activity GCA patient . These biomarkers may use help direct clinical care GCA patient assist future drug development . Study visit occur monthly first year , every 3 month thereafter remainder study . Blood urine collection occur every visit . A physical exam medical medication history occur every 3 month ; also , participant ask complete several questionnaire assess disease activity , health status , tobacco , alcohol , drug use . Participants may additional study visit disease flare disease-related complication occur study .</detailed_description>
