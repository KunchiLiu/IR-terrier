	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To report success proportion treatment persistent nasolacrimal duct obstruction three surgical procedure : balloon catheter dilation , nasolacrimal intubation , simple probe . - To obtain descriptive data regard symptom quality life patient receive type surgical procedure , compare success proportion patient undergo balloon catheter dilation undergo nasolacrimal intubation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Surgical Procedures Treatment Persistent Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction Children &lt; 4 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasolacrimal duct obstruction ( NLDO ) common ocular condition first year life . As many 95 % case resolve spontaneously one year age . For child condition resolve spontaneously , initial surgical management probe nasolacrimal duct . Such procedure often successful , cure rate 95 % , especially first year life . However , patient initial procedure successful repeat surgery need . Failure initial probe thought associate abnormal nasolacrimal anatomy , closure heal surgical opening nasolacrimal duct , continue occlusion inferior turbinate , creation false passage , faulty technique . Several case series repeat surgery nasolacrimal obstruction report . These study generally retrospective , uncontrolled , unmasked , conduct single center . These study also use differ definition treatment success , make difficult compare outcome technique . There currently accept clinical practice management child . Clinicians choose among repeat probing , repeat probe inferior turbinate infracture , multipass probing , balloon catheter dilation , nasolacrimal duct intubation . Repeat probe many year method available persistent obstruction . However , repeat probe procedure associate failure , surgeon begin probe nasolacrimal duct place temporary stent nasolacrimal duct . Nasolacrimal duct intubation alternative probe relief NLDO thirty year . Most often , silicone tube leave drainage system 1 3 month allow time complete heal around tube result canalization . The stent remove topical anesthesia . Conscious sedation general anesthesia may utilize investigator discretion . The reported success proportion nasolacrimal intubation follow fail probe vary 69 % 100 % publish report . More recently , nasolacrimal probe combine balloon design forcibly expand nasolacrimal duct , strategy take angioplasty . The balloon catheter dilation available past 10 year . This procedure involve probe nasolacrimal duct semi-flexible wire probe inflatable balloon tip . This technique use primary treatment NLDO well treatment previous surgical failure . Balloon dilation promote less complex procedure compare intubation , require retrieval probe nose . An additional advantage stent leave nasolacrimal system procedure complete , eliminate post-operative issue regard removal tube . The reported success proportion balloon catheter dilation vary 50 % 94 % publish report . The public health importance study potential reduce total number procedure necessary NLDO fail probe well reduce need dacryocystorhinostomy ( DCR ) surgery child . Reductions number procedure reduce health care expenditure would expect associated well quality life patient . The study design observational study largely approximate standard clinical practice . All procedure consistent standard care exception questionnaire patient 's parent complete study visit NLDO symptom quality life .</detailed_description>
