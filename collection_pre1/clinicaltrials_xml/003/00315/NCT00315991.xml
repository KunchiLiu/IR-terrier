	<detailed_description>Successful diabetes management relies process self-regulation treatment behavior guide feedback change blood glucose ( BG ) level decision-making . The process involve self-regulation study extensively adults Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ( T1DM ) , lead development sophisticated research tool significantly advanced understanding ability predict clinical outcome . Additionally , research lead development highly effective , empirically base , pyschobehavioral intervention , Blood Glucose Awareness Training ( BGAT ) improve self-regulation clinical outcome adult T1DM . Unfortunately , process involve self-regulation pediatric diabetes receive virtually empirical attention . The purpose project correct scientific neglect self-regulation pediatric diabetes adapt conceptual methodological tool use adult study investigate process diabetes regulation school-aged child ( 6-11 year ) T1DM parent develop test intervention enhance skill critical process .</detailed_description>
