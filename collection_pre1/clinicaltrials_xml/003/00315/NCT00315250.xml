	<brief_summary>We propose build preliminary data evaluate non-dopaminergic/non-motor clinical biomarkers fully assess marker threshold Parkinson disease ( PD ) . Development reliable biomarkers dopaminergic non-dopaminergic manifestation Parkinson disease ( PD ) relate disorder may dramatically accelerate research PD etiology , pathophysiology , therapeutic . Biomarkers broadly define characteristic objectively measure evaluated indicator normal biological process , pathogenic process , pharmacologic response therapeutic intervention . Specific biomarkers may useful onset neurodegeneration , onset disease , and/or mark disease progression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two hundred patient undergone neurological evaluation general community neurologist questionable diagnosis PD recruit participate study . Subjects refer neurologist Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders ( IND ) New Haven , CT. All subject clinically evaluate IND two movement disorder expert . At baseline visit subject also undergo [ 123I ] ß-CIT SPECT ANAM , voice acoustic , olfactory , Spiral biochemical testing . Each movement disorder expert make initial clinical diagnosis baseline within three month follow-up . At three month visit one movement disorder expert provide DAT image data review data subject referral physician . The movement disorder physician remain blind imaging biomarker data . The blinded movement disorder expert provide final clinical diagnosis 12 month follow-up visit , represent 'gold standard ' diagnosis study . Statistical analysis determine sensitivity specificity ANAM , voice acoustic , olfactory , Spiral biochemical testing compare [ 123I ] ß-CIT SPECT , gold standard clinical diagnosis complete . All subject DAT deficit 10 % without DAT deficit ask return repeat evaluation 24 month .</detailed_description>
