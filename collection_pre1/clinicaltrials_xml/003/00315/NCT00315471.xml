	<brief_title>Determining Disease Activity Biomarkers Individuals With Takayasu 's Arteritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Takayasu 's arteritis chronic inflammatory condition affect aorta , large blood vessel body , branch . Inflammation cause segment vessel become narrowed , block , even stretch , possibly result aneurysm . The disease rare commonly occur young Asian woman . Symptoms may include arm pain use , decrease absent pulse , lightheadedness dizziness , headache , visual disturbance . Many individual Takayasu ' arteritis , however , apparent symptom despite disease activity . Additionally , current test use measure vessel inflammation consider unreliable inconsistent . It therefore difficult determine extent disease activity person Takayasu 's arteritis . This study use novel scientific method establish new biomarkers use monitor disease activity individual Takayasu 's arteritis . These biomarkers may use help direct clinical care assist future drug development . Study visit occur monthly first year , every 3 month thereafter remainder study . Blood urine collection occur every visit . A physical examination , disease assessment , review medication occur every 3 month ; participant may also ask complete various questionnaire . Diagnostic testing , may include chest radiograph , echocardiogram , magnetic resonance imaging , angiography , occur every 6 month . Tobacco , alcohol , drug use assess yearly basis . Participants may additional study visit disease flare disease-related complication occur study .</detailed_description>
