	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To compare effectiveness safety weekend atropine augment plano lens sound eye versus weekend atropine alone moderate amblyopia ( 20/40 20/100 ) child 3 less 7 year old . - To provide data response severe amblyopia ( 20/125 20/400 ) atropine treatment without plano lens .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Atropine Atropine Plus Plano Lens Sound Eye Amblyopia Children 3 &lt; 7 Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atropine effective treatment moderate amblyopia . Reduction plus sphere sound eye accept method enhance possibly accelerate treatment effect . Demonstrating additional value plano lens term speed improvement shorten treatment period , possibly improve child parental compliance , lead improve overall outcome patient amblyopia . If plano lens lead great improvement , less permanent visual impairment patient history amblyopia . It also important determine use plano lens conjunction atropine deleterious effect sound eye , yes , often occur . Little known pharmacologic treatment severe amblyopia . This study provide important prospectively determined outcome data little additional expense . In study conduct Pediatric Eye Disease Investigator Group , A Randomized Trial Comparing Daily Atropine Versus Weekend Atropine Moderate Amblyopia , use weekend atropine moderate amblyopia effective daily treatment . Intermittent atropine use ( use weekend ) theoretical potential benefit sound eye time week cycloplegia partial . It possible allow loss cycloplegic effect course week may safer sound eye . The study design simple trial , type amblyopia therapy determine randomization process , approximate standard clinical practice . The two treatment regime 18 week primary treatment period : 1 ) Atropine 1 % weekend day sound eye 2 ) Atropine 1 % weekend day sound eye plus plano lens sound eye .</detailed_description>
