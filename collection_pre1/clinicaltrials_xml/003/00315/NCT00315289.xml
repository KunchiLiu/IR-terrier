	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To report success proportion simple probe within different age group patient 24 month age . - To obtain descriptive data regard symptom quality life patient receive simple probe . - To obtain similar data simple probe patient 24 month age old , intubation patient age 6 - &lt; 48 month , balloon catheter dilation patient age 6 - &lt; 48 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Primary Surgical Treatment Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction Children Less Than Four Years Old</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nasolacrimal duct obstruction ( NLDO ) common ocular condition first year life . Most case resolve spontaneously massage . Many study primary treatment nasolacrimal duct obstruction report . These case series largely retrospective , uncontrolled , conduct single center . Simple probe widely-used initial treatment NLDO infancy . Two differ approach simple probe often use , immediate office probing ( early probing-generally 6 month age ) , medical management ( episodic antibiotic drop massage lacrimal sac ) 9-13 month age follow probe general anesthesia ( late probing ) . The possible advantage early probe avoidance general anesthesia , immediate resolution symptom , less cost , prevention fibrosis inflammation nasolacrimal duct . The advantage late probe include comfort procedure avoidance procedure completely . Both early late probing approach usually successful treatment NLDO patient 2 year age , report success proportion vary 54 % 98 % . Although number study find probe highly successful without age-related decline least 4 year age beyond , suspicion among clinician clinically-important decline success proportion among progressively old age group preschool child . A large prospective interventional case series might help clarify whether age-related decline success . Balloon catheter dilation become popular initial surgical treatment NLDO especially child older one year . This procedure involve probe nasolacrimal duct semiflexible wire probe inflatable balloon tip . Nasolacrimal intubation use primary treatment clinician older child duct feel tight . While generally successful , less certainty success proportion procedure perform primary treatment . It also unknown often procedure use initial treatment . Probing nasolacrimal duct repair NLDO successful procedure infancy childhood . Simple probe long standard approach , though age procedure decline effectiveness controversial . Clinicians urge manufacturer medical equipment consider intubation balloon dilation even age range probe highly successful , increase chance success . A prospective non-randomized study outcomes many center strategy might allow good estimate success technique often use extend age range . Such study might help define factor associated failure technique . The study design observational study approximate standard clinical practice . All procedure consistent standard care exception questionnaire patient 's parent complete study visit NLDO symptom quality life . The surgical center engage research data collect surgical personnel . Treatment success define absence clinical sign nasolacrimal duct obstruction : presence epiphora , increase tear film , mucous discharge .</detailed_description>
