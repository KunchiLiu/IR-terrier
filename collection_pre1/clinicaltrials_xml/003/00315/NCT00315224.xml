	<brief_summary>The present work examines impact pulse pressure footprint vascular age cardiovascular benefit endurance train elderly hypertensive . METHODS AND RESULTS : 54 patient ≥ 60 year antihypertensive treatment diastolic 24h-ambulatory blood pressure ( ABP ) ≤ 90 mmHg randomly assign sedentary activity heart-rate control 12 week exercise program , consist walk treadmill target lactate concentration 2.5 ± 0.5 mmol/l . 24h-ambulatory blood pressure , physical performance , arterial elasticity , endothelium-derived vasodilation , quality life , weight assess baseline follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Based previous study sport hypertension , expect intervention result decrease systolic 24h-ambulatory BP ( systolic ABP ) least 6 mm Hg training group change control group.16,17 This difference consider clinically relevant . A sample size 23 group 80 % power detect difference mean 6 mmHg assume common standard deviation 7 mmHg , baseline systolic ABP 140 mmHg two-sided p &lt; 0.05 . We estimate drop-out rate 15 % leading sample size 27 patient per group . Patients recruit hypertension outpatient clinic . Inclusion criterion current antihypertensive treatment , diastolic ABP ≤ 90 mmHg , age ≥ 60 year . Prior exercise program , cardiac function examine ECG echocardiogram . Exclusion criterion regular engagement physical exercise training past 12 week prior inclusion study , symptomatic peripheral arterial occlusive disease , aortic insufficiency stenosis &gt; stage I , hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy ( HOCM ) , congestive heart failure ( &gt; NYHA II ) , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia haemodynamic relevance , systolic office BP ≥ 180 mmHg , sign acute ischemia exercise ECG , change antihypertensive medication past 6 week prior inclusion study follow-up period . According criterion 54 patient enrol randomized exercise control group . Physical performance assess use modify Bruce-protocol . Arterial elasticity measure pulse-wave analysis radial artery . Endothelium-dependent vasodilation assess sonographically flow-mediated vasodilation . 24h-ABP monitoring perform use Spacelabs 90207 monitor . The follow-up BP vascular measurement train group conduct within 2 day last training session . The training program , consist walking treadmill accord interval-training pattern , carry 3 time weekly 12 week . If patient miss train session , program prolong 36 workout carry . The initial duration training session 30 minute . During first week , training consist 5 workload 3 min ; workloads patient walk half-speed 3 min . Exercise duration gradually increase 4 x 5 min day second week , 3 x 8 min third , 3 x 10 min fourth 2 x 15 min fifth week . In sixth week , exercise progressively increased 30 , 32 36 min carry without interruption . Training intensity corresponds speed necessary reach lactate concentration 2.5 ± 0.5 mmol/l capillary blood slightly aerobic threshold . Heart rate training control heart-rate monitor . As lactate concentration sink 2.0 mmol/l exercise heart rate decrease 5/min result training adaptation , treadmill speed increase 0.5 km/h elevation increase 3 % maintain training intensity . We previously show training protocol lead substantial increase physical performance short time . During train patient continuously supervise physician .</detailed_description>
