	<brief_summary>Patients receive standard 5 mCi dosimetric dose fission-derived Iodine I 131 Tositumomab . Pharmacokinetic data primary endpoint analysis derive test do blood sample draw 12 timepoints first 7 day follow administration dosimetric dose . Whole body gamma camera image obtain six day follow dosimetric dose . Organ tumor dosimetry data generate gamma camera count specific organ tumor . All scan examine independent review panel evaluate biodistribution radionuclide . Using dosimetric data three six image time point patient 's weight , patient-specific activity ( mCi ) Iodine-131 calculate deliver desire total body dose radiation ( 75 cGy ) . Patients receive infusion unlabeled Tositumomab ( 450 mg ) immediately follow infusion patient specific dose tellurium-derived Iodine I 131 Tositumomab ( 35 mg ) deliver total body dose ( TBD ) 75 cGy . Patients follow closely obtain safety information post-treatment period , response safety 3,6 , 12 month first year , annually thereafter five year , annually additional safety outcomes information 10 year .</brief_summary>
