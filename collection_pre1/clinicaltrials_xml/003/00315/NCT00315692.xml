	<brief_title>Risk Ovarian Cancer Patients With Pelvic Mass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Pelvic Mass study prospective , multi-center , double blind , statistically power clinical trial enroll female subject â‰¥18 year age present gynecologist gynecological oncologist pelvic mass ( defined simple , complex solid ovarian cyst / pelvic mass ) schedule undergo surgery . The serum tumor marker CA125 widely use marker ovarian cancer , however , sufficiently sensitive specific detection early stage disease . The level soluble mesothelin relate peptide ( SMRP ) HE4 also recently find elevated woman ovarian cancer . The result pilot study suggest use HE4 may improve sensitivity CA125 provide stratification patient present pelvic mass high , intermediate low risk group . HE4 CA125 serum level evaluate study ability stratify patient present pelvic mass risk group low , intermediate high probability harbor ovarian cancer time initial presentation . The algorithm use two serum marker stratify patient develop use pilot study data evaluate prospective multicenter pelvic mass study . We also evaluate inclusion additional biomarkers risk factor , ultrasound score , age , menopausal status , algorithm see improvement stratification patient risk group . The primary objective study estimate risk find ovarian cancer time surgery pre- post-menopausal woman present pelvic mass . Multiple serum biomarkers ( CA125 HE4 ) evaluate estimate risk patient harbor ovarian cancer time presentation . The secondary objective study develop multivariate predictive algorithm combine CA125 HE4 radiological imaging result , patient risk factor ( age , menopausal status ethnicity ) estimate risk ovarian cancer , include low malignant potential ( LMP ) / borderline tumor , time surgery patient present pelvic mass . The exploratory endpoint include evaluation serum , plasma and/or urine level CA125 , HE4 additional novel biomarkers SMRP , alone combination radiological imaging result subject risk factor determine ability estimate risk cancer time surgery patient present pelvic mass .</detailed_description>
