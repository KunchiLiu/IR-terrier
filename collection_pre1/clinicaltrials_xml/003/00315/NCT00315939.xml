	<brief_title>Improving Control Reducing Risk Hypoglycemic Episodes Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects randomize group A group B match gender , age , baseline HbA1c . Group A begin routine self-monitored blood glucose ( SMBG ) alone ( level 1 ) , follow sequentially IBMF-1 ( level 2 ) IBMF-2 ( level 3 ) . Group B begin level 2 , follow level 3 level 1 . Each level continue 3 month proceed follow : level 1 routine SMBG . Subjects give LifeScan OneTouch UltraSmart meter ( LifeScan Inc. , Milpitas , CA ) free strip , ask perform SMBG four five time per day . No additional instruction time SMBG interpretation data give . No change treatment recommend . At visit , subject ask health concern new medication change insulin . This information record use feedback . Thus , level 1 regard control condition , different routine SMBG subject enrol study give free test strip . IBMF-1 ( level 2 ) retain level 1 , HHC ( hand-held computer ) give subject , programmed estimate HbA1c , risk hypoglycemia ( Low BG Index , LBGI ) , glucose variability ( Average Daily Risk Range , ADRR ) use previously publish algorithm . The subject ask carry HHC enter glucose reading per- forming SMBG . The estimate HbA1c update weekly , estimate risk hypoglycemia glucose variability update SMBG entry . Detailed instruction provide mean different type glucose feedback ; study staff available answer question . IBMF-2 ( level 3 ) retain level 2 , HHC ask subject provide symptom rating BG ( blood glucose ) low equal number match euglycemic reading . From data , HHC estimate set potentially significant symptom hypoglycemia individual , use iterative algorithm follow previously publish symptom significance estimation procedure . The patient manual HHC program provide supplementary data publish manuscript .</detailed_description>
