	<brief_title>Supplemental Postoperative Oxygen Wound Infection Morbidly Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Wound infection common serious consequence anesthesia surgery . Infection associate major complication include intra-abdominal abscess , peritonitis without leakage , sepsis . The average wound infection thus prolongs hospitalization week , double need ICU care , double mortality . The first hour follow bacterial contamination constitute decisive period infection establish . Techniques aim improve resistance surgical wound infection thus effective implemented decisive period — even though infection detect clinically five-to-ten day surgery . The primary defense surgical pathogen oxidative kill neutrophil . This reaction critically depend tissue oxygen tension . It therefore unsurprising subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension ( PsqO2 ) inversely correlate risk surgical wound infection . As might expect , supplemental perioperative oxygen administration increase tissue oxygen partial pressure ( compare FIO2 30 % ) decrease wound infection risk . While 100 % oxygen associate atelectasis pulmonary inflammation , others show 80 % oxygen . Inadequate healing also common . Scar formation start transcription pro-collagen , undergoes post-translational hydroxylation abundant proline lysine residue . This promote cross-linking within collagen strand provide tensile strength begin heal process . The prolyl lysyl hydroxylases catalyze reaction depend substrate oxygen . The Km ( substrate concentration velocity reaction half-maximal ) O2 prolyl hydroxylase variously estimate 20 , 25 , 100 mmHg . Even use conservative estimate , data suggest proline hydroxylation collagen ( e.g. , scar formation ) PO2 dependent range 0 ≈200 mmHg , 90 % effect occur 90 mmHg . In vitro vivo animal evidence support theory . Inadequate healing associate anastomotic leakage , wound dehiscence , bleed . In morbidly obese patient , incidence infection major complication relate either infection inadequate heal 15-20 % gastric bypass base preliminary data review record Washington University . Roughly 30 % American population obese body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 30 kg/m2 ; 5 % population morbidly obese , BMI exceed 40 kg/m2 . These patient extraordinarily high risk wound infection , infection patient especially severe . Cardiac output , circulate blood volume , rest oxygen consumption increase obese ; however , total blood flow sub-normal relation body weight . Obesity augment size individual fat cell without increase blood flow . Specifically , fat tissue hypoperfused poorly oxygenate . Intraoperative tissue oxygenation abnormally low obese patient postoperative tissue oxygenation especially low — although improve oxygen administration . It thus seem likely inadequate tissue oxygenation contribute observed extraordinary high wound infection risk obese patient . Although supplemental oxygen surgery first two-to-six hour surgery halve risk surgical wound infection , remain unknown whether prolonged supplemental postoperative oxygen significantly augment benefit intraoperative oxygen . There evidence suggest prolonged postoperative oxygen administration may helpful . For example , experimental infection guinea pig reduce administration supplemental oxygen 45 h. In contrast , restrict oxygen 45 minute contamination reduces tensile wound strength rabbit restrict oxygen 5 full day . No study human evaluate effect supplemental postoperative oxygen surgical wound infection associate complication . To extent supplemental oxygen surgery likely reduce incidence major complication relate wound infection healing , benefit especially likely morbidly obese patient baseline tissue oxygenation usually sub-optimal risk high . We thus propose test hypothesis incidence major complication relate infection inadequate healing reduce morbidly obese patient give 80 % inspired oxygen 12-18 hour surgery compare patient give 80 % oxygen surgery . Patients enrol two OUTCOMES RESEARCH Group sit : University Louisville Cleveland Clinic . Patients undergo gastric bypass give 80 % intraoperative oxygen randomly assign 30 % 80 % oxygen first postoperative morning . The primary outcome composite major complication plausibly related infection healing . A maximum 1,276 patient provide 90 % power detect 25 % reduction proportion patient least one major complication . Supplemental oxygen safe inexpensive , cost dollar per patient . Confirming hypothesis would indicate clinician reduce risk serious complication make essentially trivial modification postoperative patient care .</detailed_description>
