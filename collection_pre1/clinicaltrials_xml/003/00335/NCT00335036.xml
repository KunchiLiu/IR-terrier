	<brief_summary>This randomize , prospective clinical trial compare 2 different type implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) lead child patient congenital heart disease . ICD lead survival patient group particularly suboptimal , lead extraction technically difficult carry substantial morbidity risk . Recently , improve ICD lead design release currently utilized patient . The main aim study determine either type lead performs well term implantation electrical characteristic , long-term survival without break , ease extractability .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pediatric Lead Extractability Survival Evaluation ( PLEASE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recognition ICD therapy child life-saving , well development small device lead , result increase ICD implantation pediatric young adult population . However , ICD lead survival patient group suboptimal . Lead extraction technically difficult substantial morbidity . Recently , improve ICD lead design release currently utilize . While development transvenous ICD lead allow less invasive implantation , long-term presence lead carry risk . When lead becomes infected cause patient morbidity , must remove . Because large caliber ICD lead presence uninsulated shocking coil , non-functional ICD lead usually warrant removal avoid future mechanical electrical lead interaction . The large size ICD lead concern young population , particularly regard avoid accumulation implant hardware . The principal indication lead revision child young adult lead malfunction , commonly related patient growth increase physical activity young population . The removal chronic indwell pacer ICD lead trivial . Scar tissue begin bind transvenous lead endothelial surface several week implantation , fibrous adherence progress time , exacerbate high-energy shock delivery . In child young adult ICD recipient , exuberant lead scar prevalent , particularly region venous entry , high voltage shock coil , lead tip . Transvenous lead extraction facilitate use telescope sheath power sheath advance lead disrupt scar tissue free lead endothelium . The 2 ICD lead type compare ( thin ICD lead versus ePTFE-coated lead ) propose study clinical equipoise . Both type believe improved prior generation ICD lead . However , direct comparison perform . As pediatric congenital heart disease patient subgroup young average ICD patient population , great likelihood long-term survival , therefore , issue lead survival , durability , extractability critically important . While theme important ICD patient , particularly germane young patient active lifestyle , general , expect outlive ICD lead . This study prospectively assess improvement ICD lead design , specifically compare Gore ePTFE coat thin caliber ICD lead pediatric congenital heart disease population . Specific Aim # 1 : To prospectively evaluate long-term performance modern-generation ICD lead pediatric congenital heart disease patient . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine potential beneficial effect two improvement ICD lead design - Gore ePTFE coil coat thin lead diameter pediatric congenital heart disease patient . Specific Aim # 3 : To directly compare safety efficacy new ICD lead technology term extractability pediatric congenital heart disease patient . The primary hypothesis improve lead design small diameter lead demonstrate benefit survival extractability . The primary outcome variable include : ) ICD lead functionality performance subtype , b ) inappropriate shock due lead issue , c ) lead extractability subtype ( Gore-coated versus thin lead ) . Secondary outcome include comparison implant electrical parameter , patient morbidity mortality , compare new lead type historical pediatric control standard transvenous ICD lead .</detailed_description>
