	<brief_title>PET Scan Combined With CT Scan Evaluating Treatment Response Patients Undergoing Treatment Bone Cancer Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine whether FDA-approved device combine fludeoxyglucose ^18F positron-emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) CT scan ( FDG-PET/CT ) accurately locate determine extent disease patient undergoing treatment bone soft tissue sarcoma . - Determine whether FDG-PET/CT scan effective evaluate response sarcoma treatment . - Determine whether new FDG-PET/CT device improve ability evaluate treatment response early accurately . - Correlate change glucose metabolic activity early late treatment overall progression-free survival . - Correlate change glucose metabolic activity early late treatment degree tumor necrosis time surgery . OUTLINE : This prospective , pilot study . Patients stratify accord disease ( high-grade soft tissue sarcoma v low-grade soft tissue sarcoma v osteosarcoma ) . Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose ^18F positron-emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) /CT scan baseline within 2 week 12 week start treatment ( total 3 scan ) . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 120 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
