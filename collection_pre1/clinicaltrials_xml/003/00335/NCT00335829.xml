	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Chemoembolization kill tumor cell carry chemotherapy drug directly tumor block blood flow tumor . Giving bevacizumab together chemoembolization may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together chemoembolization work treat patient liver cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Improve median progression-free survival patient unresectable hepatocellular cancer treat bevacizumab transarterial chemoembolization therapy . Secondary - Characterize safety toxicity regimen patient . - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab week 1 , 3 , 5 . Beginning week 3 , patient also receive transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) therapy . Treatment repeat approximately every 8 week 3 course . Patients achieve &lt; 100 % necrosis MRI first course receive 2 additional course bevacizumab TACE . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
