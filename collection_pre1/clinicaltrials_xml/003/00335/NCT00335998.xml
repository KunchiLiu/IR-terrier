	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , 3-AP cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . 3-AP may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . 3-AP cisplatin may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving 3-AP external-beam radiation therapy together cisplatin may kill tumor cell . This phase I trial study side effect best dose 3-AP give together external-beam radiation therapy without cisplatin treat patient gynecologic cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Intravenous Triapine ( IND # 68338 ) Combination With Pelvic Radiation Therapy With Without Weekly Intravenous Cisplatin Chemotherapy Locally Advanced Cervical , Vaginal , Pelvic Gynecologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Triapine® give combination pelvic radiotherapy without weekly intravenous cisplatin chemotherapy . II . To determine dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) Triapine® give combination pelvic radiotherapy without weekly intravenous cisplatin chemotherapy . III . To determine safety sequelae intravenous Triapine® give combination pelvic radiotherapy without weekly intravenous cisplatin chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluation intravenous Triapine® 's targeted inhibition ribonucleotide reductase tumor tissue biopsy pretreatment evaluation external beam radiotherapy ( Day 10 ) . II . Serial monitoring methemoglobin level therapy give Triapine® 's iron chelating property . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study 3-AP . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group base eligibility* receive cisplatin ( yes v ) . NOTE : *Patients refuse candidate cisplatin chemotherapy due prior platinum adverse sensitivity , active neuropathy , comobid illness , determine treat physician , eligible receive 3-AP alone pelvic radiotherapy . Group 1 : Patients undergo external-beam pelvic radiotherapy daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 . Patients also receive 3-AP IV 2 hour day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 22 , 24 , 26 , 29 , 31 , 33 cisplatin IV 1½ hour day 2 , 9 , 16 , 23 , 30 . Group 2 : Patients undergo external-beam pelvic radiotherapy receive 3-AP group 1 . In group , patient undergo intracavitary interstitial brachytherapy least weekly 3-5 week external-beam radiotherapy per standard care . Cohorts 3-6 patient group 1 1-3 patient group 2 receive escalating dose 3-AP maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . At least 6 patient treated MTD . Patients undergo blood draw day 1 10 treatment 3-AP 2 , 4 , 6 , 24 hour start treatment assess methemoglobin level 3-AP plasma level . Patients also undergo punch biopsy day 1 10 determine R2 protein level Western blot analysis , ribonucleotide reductase R2 protein level flow cytometry , cytidine deoxyphosphate reductase assay . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 24 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
