	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well combination chemotherapy , radiation therapy , and/or surgery work treat patient high-risk kidney tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate whether treatment regimen contain cyclophosphamide , carboplatin , etoposide alternate vincristine , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide ( regimen UH-1 ) improve event-free overall survival patient diffuse anaplastic Wilms ' tumor ( DAWT ) compare historical control . II . Evaluate , phase II `` window '' study , antitumor activity combination vincristine protracted-schedule irinotecan hydrochloride patient metastatic DAWT . III . Evaluate whether regimen UH-1 improves event-free overall survival patient malignant rhabdoid tumor ( MRT ) compare historical control . IV . Maintain excellent event-free survival patient stage I clear cell sarcoma kidney ( CCSK ) without use abdominal irradiation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe outcomes patient stage I DAWT stag I-III focal anaplastic Wilms ' tumor ( FAWT ) treat vincristine , dactinomycin , doxorubicin hydrochloride , flank radiation . II . Describe outcomes patient stage IV FAWT stage IV CCSK treat regimen UH-1 . III . Describe event-free overall survival child adolescent localize renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) ( include patient local lymph node involvement ) treat surgical resection without adjuvant therapy . IV . Describe response rate , event-free survival , overall survival patient unresectable distantly metastatic RCC treat accord institutional preference . V. Correlate histologic molecular cytogenetic finding outcome pediatric RCC . VI . Evaluate frequency germline inherit INI1 mutation renal extrarenal MRT correlate presence detectable INI1 mutation clinical outcome . VII . Determine frequency TP53 mutation anaplastic Wilms ' tumor correlate presence detectable TP53 mutation clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assign 1 6 treatment regimen accord tumor histology , stage disease , response treatment . SURGERY ( renal cell carcinoma [ RCC ] ) : Patients completely resectable stage I-IV RCC undergo surgical resection . Patients incompletely resectable stage III-IV RCC undergo treatment per physician 's choice . REGIMEN UH-1 ( stage II-III stage IV [ measurable disease ] diffuse anaplastic Wilms ' tumor [ DAWT ] , stage I-IV malignant rhabdoid tumor [ MRT ] , stage IV focal anaplastic Wilms ' tumor [ FAWT ] , stage IV clear cell sarcoma kidney [ CCSK ] ) : Patients receive vincristine IV day 1 week 1-3 , 10-12 , 13-15 , 22-24 , 28-30 ; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 15 minute day 1 cyclophosphamide ( CPM2 ) IV 15-30 minute day 1 week 1 , 10 , 13 , 22 , 28 ; cyclophosphamide ( low dos [ CPM1 ] ) IV 1 hour etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-4 carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 week 4 , 7 , 16 , 19 , 25 . Patients whose primary tumor initially resect undergo radiotherapy daily 5 day week 4-5Â½ week begin day 1 week 1 . Patients delay primary tumor resection undergo radiotherapy begin day 1 week 13 . If primary tumor previously resect , patient undergo resection , feasible , week 13 . Patients unresectable CCSK receive study therapy . IRINOTECAN/VINCRISTINE WINDOW THERAPY* ( stage IV DAWT measurable disease diagnosis ) : Patients receive vincristine IV day 1 irinotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-5 week 1 2 . Patients progressive disease ( PD ) treat regimen UH-1 . Patients stable disease ( SD ) , partial response ( PR ) , complete response ( CR ) receive another course irinotecan hydrochloride/vincristine window therapy begin day 22 . After second course , patient SD PD treat regimen UH-1 patient PR CR treat regimen UH-2 . NOTE : *Patients eligible unwilling receive window therapy , receive therapy regimen UH-1 . REGIMEN UH-2 ( DAWT CR/PR irinotecan hydrochloride/vincristine window therapy ) : Patients receive vincristine day 1 week 1-3 , 10 , 11 , 16-21 , 25 , 26 , 28-30 , 34-36 doxorubicin hydrochloride CPM2 regimen UH-1 week 1 , 16 , 19 , 28 , 34 . Patients also receive CPM1 , etoposide , carboplatin regimen UH-1 week 4 , 7 , 13 , 22 , 31 irinotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-5 week 10 , 11 , 25 , 26 . Patients whose primary tumor initially resect undergo radiotherapy regimen UH-1 begin day 1 week 1 . Patients delay primary tumor resection undergo radiotherapy regimen UH-1 begin day 1 week 7 . If primary tumor previously resect , patient undergo resection , feasible , week 7 . REGIMEN I ( stage I-III CCSK ) : Patients receive vincristine IV day 1 week 1-3 , 5-9 , 8-9 , 11-14 , 19 , 25 ; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 15 minute day 1 cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour day 1-3 week 1 , 7 , 13 , 19 , 25 ; cyclophosphamide IV etoposide IV day 1-5 week 4 , 10 , 16 , 22 . Patients whose primary tumor initially resect ( except stage I CCSK ) undergo radiotherapy regimen UH-1 begin day 1 week 1 . Patients delay primary tumor resection undergo radiotherapy regimen UH-1 begin day 1 week 13 . If primary tumor previously resect , patient undergo resection , feasible , week 13 . REGIMEN DD-4A ( stage I DAWT stag I-III FAWT ) : Patients receive dactinomycin IV 1-5 minute day 1 week 1 , 7 , 13 , 19 , 25 ; vincristine IV day 1 week 1-10 , 13 , 16 , 19 , 22 , 25 ; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 15 minute day 1 week 4,10 , 16 , 22 . Patients whose primary tumor initially resect undergo radiotherapy regimen UH-1 begin day 1 week 1 . Patients delay primary tumor resection undergo radiotherapy regimen UH-1 begin day 1 week 13 . If primary tumor previously resect , patient undergo resection , feasible , week 13 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically least 3 year .</detailed_description>
