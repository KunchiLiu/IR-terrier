	<brief_title>PHA-739358 Treating Patients With Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia That Relapsed After Imatinib Mesylate c-ABL Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Explore clinical efficacy PHA-739358 , term hematological response last ≥ 4 week , patient chronic myelogenous leukemia relapse imatinib mesylate c-ABL therapy . - Explore safety profile drug patient . - Explore pharmacokinetic profile drug N-oxide metabolite PHA-816359 plasma . - Explore modulation histone H3 CRKL phosphorylation PHA-739358 administration . - Explore relationship plasma drug level modulation histone H3 CRKL phosphorylation . - Explore clinical efficacy drug , term cytogenetic response bone marrow . - Explore response depend status T315I mutation BCR-ABL kinase . OUTLINE : This pilot , open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive PHA-739358 IV 6 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients benefit treatment may receive additional course discretion investigator . Patients undergo blood collection bone marrow biopsy periodically pharmacologic biomarker correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 16 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
