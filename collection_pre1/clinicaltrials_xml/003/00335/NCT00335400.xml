	<brief_summary>To prepare eye cataract surgery , drug must give eye allow surgery take place . Traditionally , dilate drop drop contain NSAIDs ( control inflammation ) give patient well advance surgery repeat time interval . As well , gel contain lidocaine apply eye prior surgery anesthetize ( reduce pain feeling ) area eye . Although effective , procedure time-consuming costly nursing staff . Recently , hospital report success mix pupil-dilating NSAID drop lidocaine gel , create `` anesthetic dilating gel '' . Although success report , study clearly demonstrate `` anesthetic dilating gel '' effective dilating pupil reduce sensitivity cornea surgery traditional method drop gel . It possible dilate gel less effective due slow diffusion drug eye . The study compare effectiveness anesthetic dilate gel standard pre-operative pharmacologic regimen cataract surgery . Stability ( maintain effectiveness time ) contamination study gel also assess . If dilate gel show effective regard pupil dilation corneal anesthesia , maintain stability sterility time , hospital encourage use anesthetic dilating gel routinely pre-operative procedure cataract surgery .</brief_summary>
