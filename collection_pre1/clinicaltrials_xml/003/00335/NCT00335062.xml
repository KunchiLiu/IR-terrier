	<brief_summary>Graves ' disease , common form hyperthyroidism child , cause Thyrotropin ( TSH ) Receptor Antibodies ( TRAbs ) mimic action TSH . The disease lead significant morbidity child due prolong course antithyroid medication often require sustained immunological remission high risk relapse medication withdrawn . The ability predict patient likely fail medical management would greatly improve choice therapy . In past , large goiter size , age diagnosis , increase biochemical severity , decrease body mass index associate poor prognosis , clinical indicator lack sensitivity specificity . Preliminary data suggest new TRAb assay sensitive specific measurement TRAbs child Graves ' disease . In addition , variation antibody time patient . The goal proposal prospectively follow child newly diagnose Graves ' disease use microarray technology determine gene whose expression differ patient respond medical therapy versus need definitive therapy earlier disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In present grant proposal , plan utilize two new assay ( bind bioassay ) order identify additional predictor Graves ' disease apply well characterize group patient Graves ' disease follow prospectively . More specifically , plan investigate antibody measure lambda : kappa light chain antibody ratio pediatric patient . We assess epitope heterogeneity use novel chimeric protein specific portion TSH receptor replace closely related LH receptor . We utilize microarray technology determine difference gene expression profile responder versus non responder . It hop method lead improve ability follow disease progression monitor efficacy therapy .</detailed_description>
