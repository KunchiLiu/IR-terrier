	<brief_summary>Some patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) take nebulised treatment ease symptom breathlessness , include drug ipratropium . Nebulised bronchodilator drug take 4 time day , take 15 minute time . Although treatment isbe effective , patient report time take set-up use nebuliser disincentive regular use . By contrast , inhaler device easy use follow appropriate instruction , take second administer . Inhaled tiotropium daily treatment take inhaler show effective COPD . We wish ass whether inhaled Tiotropium effective nebulised ipratropium patient stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Replacement Nebulised Ipratropium With Inhaled Tiotropium Stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tiotropium ipratropium bromide antimuscarinic bronchodilator , license treatment COPD similar side-effect profile . Tiotropium administer inhaler device ( HandihalerÂ® ) show superior placebo inhale ipratropium bromide patient COPD , short term long term study . The superiority inhale tiotropium inhaled ipratropium bromide demonstrate lung function test also measure health status . It know however inhaled tiotropium superior ipratropium bromide administer via nebuliser . We wish examine whether inhaled tiotropium effective safe nebulised ipratropium bromide patient chronic stable COPD . Design The study randomise , crossover study . The patient blind therapy technician perform pulmonary function test blind patient ' therapy . Duration The length study patient 12 week . Patient group Patients would recruit population patient supply nebuliser respiratory department Glasgow Royal Infirmary . Patients identify regularly attend out-patients department stable disease . Patients frequently admit respiratory ward exacerbation disease exclude . Patients recruit rate 2 per week . The study single site study . Following consent patient would ask complete St George 's respiratory questionnaire , undergo brief spirometry general heath/satisfaction questionnaire , include baseline transitional dyspnoea index . Patient demographic collect include ; age , sex , duration COPD , smoke history , height , weight , concurrent therapy inhale oral . The patient would randomise either remain nebulised ipratropium 6 week commence inhaled tiotropium via HandiHaler . Patients commence tiotropium would give instruction use new inhaler tell use nebulised ipratropium . All medication would remain . The patient randomise ipratropium would instruct continue take nebulised ipratropium . All patient would issue diary card would record pattern nebuliser use , symptom , adverse event additional medication require eg antibiotic . Patients also ask record health resource use , eg visit GP admission hospital diary card . A compliance check form capsule count undertaken . At end six week patient would undergo brief spirometry , complete St George 's respiratory questionnaire general health/satisfaction questionnaire . At point patient 's therapy cross , take inhaler would take nebuliser vice versa . There wash period arm study , since comparison make baseline end period treatment lung function questionnaire , diary card analyse final 4 week treatment period . Those patient commence tiotropium would give instruction use inhaler restart ipratropium would ask take nebulised therapy . All patient would issue diary card would record pattern nebuliser use , symptom , adverse event additional medication require eg antibiotic . Patients also ask record health resource use , eg visit GP admission hospital diary card . At end second 6-week period patient would complete St George 's respiratory questionnaire , undergo brief spirometry general heath/satisfaction questionnaire . A compliance check form capsule count undertaken . At end study patient ask therapy preferred recommendation make GP depend preference . Details patient 's last dose inhale therapy record time spirometry . Patient number The number patient include study 45 . The patient number base 90 % statistical power detect mean change 0.2L FEV1 visit 2 3 result treatment , use 5 % significance level pair test . This justification base previous study conservatively indicate standard deviation FEV1 value 0.4L . Statistical analysis undertaken difference mean FEV1 value visit 2 3 use pair design parametric testing . Results present use difference mean treatment associate 95 % confidence interval . Other response variable similarly analyse evidence difference treatment effect , analysis diary card final 4 week treatment .</detailed_description>
