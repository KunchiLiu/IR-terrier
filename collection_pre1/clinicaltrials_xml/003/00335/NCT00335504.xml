	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study atorvastatin calcium see well work compare oligofructose-enriched inulin , sulindac , placebo prevent cancer patient increase risk develop colorectal neoplasia . Chemoprevention use certain drug substance keep cancer forming , grow , come back . The use atorvastatin calcium , oligofructose-enriched inulin , sulindac may stop cancer form patient increase risk colorectal neoplasia . It yet know whether atorvastatin calcium , oligofructose-enriched inulin , sulindac effective placebo prevent cancer patient increase risk develop colorectal neoplasia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Percent change number rectal aberrant cryptic focus ( ACF ) measure magnification chromoendoscopy SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Screening possible phase III test II . Effects proliferation ( Ki67 expression ) apoptosis ( caspase-3 expression ) measure biopsy sample obtain normal-appearing rectal mucosa baseline completion study treatment III . Correlation endoscopic feature histologic characteristic rectal ACF IV . Observation natural history rectal ACF patient receive placebo V. Adverse event VI . Utilization biospecimen repository archive OUTLINE : This multicenter , prospective , randomize , partially blind , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratify accord history prior surgical resection colon ( yes v ) number rectal aberrant cryptic focus ( ACF ) ( 5-9 v &gt; = 10 ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral atorvastatin calcium daily . ARM II : Patients receive oral sulindac twice daily . ARM III ( blind arm ) : Patients receive oral oligofructose-enriched inulin ( Raftilose Synergy 1 ) twice daily . ARM IV ( blind arm ) : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily . In arm , treatment continue 6 month absence unacceptable toxicity . Tissue sample collect baseline completion study treatment . Tissue examine immunohistochemistry proliferation ( Ki67 ) apoptosis ( cleave caspase-3 ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow approximately 30 day .</detailed_description>
