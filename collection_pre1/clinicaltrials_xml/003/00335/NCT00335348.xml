	<brief_title>Bortezomib Dexamethasone Treatment Maintenance Multiple Myeloma Relapse</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Velcade new drug , develop treatment patient variety cancer . In study date , show useful treatment patient advance multiple myeloma whose myeloma progressed standard drug treatment . Approximately one third response treatment , last approximately 12 month . It associate improvement symptom disease include improvement blood count , few blood transfusion lessen bone pain . There evidence patient respond Velcade give together steroid drug , Dexamethasone , commonly use treatment Myeloma , may receive past . Only small number patient treat Velcade Dexamethasone begin therapy . However , many Dexamethasone add later fail respond Velcade . Velcade approve USA Europe Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment patient myeloma . However , Velcade approve Australia therefore use study consider experimental . This study two main aim . The first ass whether Dexamethasone increase number patient respond Velcade control set clinical trial . This study specifically design patient receive least one kind standard treatment past need therapy disease relapse . The second aim study see whether treat patient Velcade Dexamethasone long period time extend time myeloma control . This known maintenance treatment . Approximately 100 patient participate around Australia .</detailed_description>
