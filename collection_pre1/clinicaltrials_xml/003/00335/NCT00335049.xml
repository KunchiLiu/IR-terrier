	<brief_summary>At time , know cause child become nearsighted ( myopic ) . STAMP help u good understand nearsightedness child . Children randomly choose wear regular glass ( single vision lens ) no-line bifocal glass ( progressive addition lens ) first year study . All child wear regular glass second year study . STAMP compare eye change shape two group help u understand child become nearsighted . The two theory myopia progression evaluate base different factor . One theory base environmental factor extend near work theory base genetically coded factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible child enrol , randomize , follow six-month interval two year child wear single vision lens second year . At visit , complete measurement component eye make explain mechanism responsible Progressive Addition Lens ( PAL ) treatment effect occur mainly first year bifocal wear ( Gwiazda et al . 2003 ) . While hyperopic retinal blur ( blur back eye ) due accommodative lag ( poor focus close work ) propose possible mechanism drive myopia progression ( Gwiazda et al . 1993 ) , others show accommodative lag accompanies rather precedes onset myopia ( Mutti et al. , 2006 ) . This suggest accommodative lag result another possible mechanism result myopia progression crystalline lens-induced ciliary-choroidal tension ( model lens eye stretch good focus close ) ( Mutti et al. , 2000 ) . According propose mechanism , high accommodative lag myopia result increase crystalline lens tension transmit choroid ( outside layer eye ) . This tension result restrict equatorial ( vertical dimension eye ) eye growth axial ( front back ) restriction eye growth yield prolate ocular shape ( eye longer wide ) myope ( Mutti et al. , 2000 ) . Comparisons : Refractive error ( glass prescription ) , axial length ( length eye ) , peripheral eye shape , accommodation ( focus ability ) , corneal shape ( shape front eye ) , anterior chamber depth , crystalline lens thickness curvature ( shape lens eye ) , central peripheral higher-order aberration ( well light focus eye ) , phoria ( eye alignment ) measure six-month interval . The primary study outcome refractive error measure cycloplegic autorefraction . Comparison biometric data collect first year PAL intervention present second year PAL intervention remove allow u differentiate two theory consideration . We also evaluate whether modest PAL treatment effect report first year PAL wear permanent .</detailed_description>
