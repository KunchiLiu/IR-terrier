	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , oxaliplatin , leucovorin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Fluorouracil may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Leucovorin calcium may protect normal cell side effect chemotherapy , may help fluorouracil work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving radiation therapy together chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give radiation therapy together fluorouracil without combination therapy work treat patient undergo surgery stage II stage III rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Fluorouracil With Without Combination Chemotherapy Followed Surgery Treating Patients With Stage II Stage III Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate pathologic complete response chemoradiation ( evidence residual tumor resect specimen ) Stage II Stage III rectal cancer stag preoperatively endorectal ultrasound ( ERUS ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , treat accord standardize chemoradiation surgery protocol , evaluate systematic pathologic exam surgical specimen . II . To study effect different chemoradiation-to-surgery interval rate pathologic complete response , surgical difficulty , postoperative complication . III . To investigate feasibility use sensitive molecular assay detect tumor cell tumor bed regional lymph node rectal cancer specimen , without pathologic complete response preoperative chemoradiation . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 4 treatment group . All patient undergo chemoradiation therapy comprise radiation therapy daily 5 day week 5 week fluorouracil intravenously ( IV ) continuously 24 hour 7 day week 6 week . GROUP I ( closed enrollment ) : Patients undergo standard surgical resection completion chemoradiation therapy . GROUP II ( closed enrollment ) : Beginning 4 week completion chemoradiation therapy , patient receive modify FOLFOX-6 chemotherapy comprise oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 2 course . After last week post-radiation chemotherapy , patient undergo standard surgical resection . GROUP III : Beginning 4 week completion chemoradiation therapy , patient receive modify FOLFOX-6 chemotherapy group II . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course . After last week post-radiation chemotherapy , patient undergo standard surgical resection . GROUP IV : Beginning 4 week completion chemoradiation therapy , patient receive modify FOLFOX-6 chemotherapy group II . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course . After last week post- radiation chemotherapy , patient undergo standard surgical resection . In group , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . A fter completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
