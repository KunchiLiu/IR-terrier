	<detailed_description>Autism neurodevelopmental disorder currently affect many 1 166 child United States . Autism consider many permanent , static condition little hope improvement . Treatment autism center special schooling behavioral therapy ; medical science currently little offer . Recent research discover autistic individual decrease cerebral perfusion , evidence gastrointestinal neuro-inflammation , increase marker oxidative stress , relative mitochondrial dysfunction . Multiple independent single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) research study reveal hypoperfusion several area autistic brain , notably temporal region area specifically related language comprehension auditory processing . Several study show diminished blood flow area correlate many clinical feature associate autism include repetitive , self-stimulatory stereotypical behavior , impairment communication , sensory perception , social interaction . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) use clinical success several cerebral hypoperfusion syndrome include cerebral palsy , fetal alcohol syndrome , close head injury , stroke . HBOT compensate decrease blood flow increase oxygen content plasma body tissue even normalize oxygen level ischemic tissue . In addition , animal study show HBOT potent anti-inflammatory effect reduces oxidative stress . Furthermore , recent evidence demonstrate HBOT increase production mitochondrion mobilize stem cell human bone marrow , may aid recovery neurodegenerative disease . Based upon finding , hypothesize HBOT improve symptom autistic individual . Our recent retrospective case series demonstrate HBOT may improve symptom autistic child . We recently complete prospective pilot trial use HBOT 18 child demonstrate statistically significant clinical improvement autistic child several standardized scale . Most scales parent-rated , although rat teacher . However , parent blind fact child receive HBOT evaluation child parent-rated scale , either could lead bias . There placebo control group . Therefore , improvement find prospective study could due merely chance natural development child . To determine HBOT improve symptom autistic child , double-blind control study indicate .</detailed_description>
