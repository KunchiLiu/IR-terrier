	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Intratympanic Application Dexamethasone Via Catheter Patients With Sudden Hearing Loss</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients suffer unilateral severe profound sudden sensorineural hearing loss ( ISSNHL ) anacusis insufficient recovery 12-21 day onset treated 14 day Dexamethasone placebo deliver intratympanically via micro-catheter temporarily implant round window niche external mini-pump . Due relatively unknown risk intratympanic treatment catheter implantation , significant spontaneous recovery rate exist standard therapy ISSNHL Germany ( systemic glucocorticoid ) , patient enrol study insufficient recovery hearing threshold could observe initial systemic therapy . The study carry 10 patient per group randomize regardless study center randomize . After last patient 10 patient per group reach endpoint interim analysis do . The statistical estimation total number subject randomize complete interim analysis responsible statistician .</detailed_description>
