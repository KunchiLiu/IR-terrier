	<detailed_description>Pharma-Pen , Inc. ( hereinafter `` Pharma-Pen '' ) Virginia Commonwealth University ( `` VCU '' ) partner demonstrate safety , effectiveness tolerability two version Pharma-Pen ( TM ) auto-injector IM injection ( Treatment 1 ) SC injection ( Treatment 2 ) untrained user compare standard IM injection ( Treatment 3 ) license healthcare professional ( e.g . nurse ) . Commercially available Influenza vaccine use model demonstrate ease-of-use effectiveness delivery system . The propose study compare safety immunogenicity three treatment healthy volunteer : 1 ) Self-administered flu vaccine give IM auto-injector thigh ; 2 ) Self-administered flu vaccine give subcutaneously auto-injector thigh ; 3 ) Standard IM vaccine administer deltoid muscle license clinician . Primary objective program demonstrate Pharma-Pen ( TM ) system safely successfully use untrained adult self-inject vaccine show result immunogenicity comparable vaccination administer trained medical personnel use conventional syringe/needle technology . There secondary information accrues study . The outcome IM route compare outcomes SC route , outcomes IM route deltoid muscle compare outcomes lateral thigh muscle . This safety/proof-of-concept study randomize , single-dose , open-label , parallel , three treatment trial 120 healthy subject ( male &amp; female , age 18 50 year ) receive influenza vaccine least four year , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , sign inform consent form . The individual non-medical individual experience give IM SC injection . Each subject randomly assign one three treatment . The study divide two successive part ( 1A 1B ) . Part 1A conduct first 12 subject randomize Treatment 1 ( 3 male , 3 female ) Treatment 2 ( 3 male , 3 female ) . The purpose part 1A obtain initial safety information IM SC auto-injectors ( Pharma-Pen [ TM ] ) carefully observe subject ( 10 % total ) assure device function design produce significant injury injection site . Part 1A conducted direct supervision Medical Investigator ( MI ) . The result part 1A forward appoint Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) . If serious device deficiency detect early part 1A , study may terminate prior 12 subject complete initial phase . Part 1B initiated approval MI SMC , base upon data 12 subject part 1A . Part 1B involve remain 108 subject . All injection perform licensed clinician supervision .</detailed_description>
