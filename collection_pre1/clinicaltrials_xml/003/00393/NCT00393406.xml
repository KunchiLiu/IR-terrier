The primary outcome measure quantitative component study dietary fat intake , fruit vegetable consumption , alcohol use physical activity , measure categorically . Physical activity first convert MET ( metabolic equivalent ) value MET value sum across activity categorize quartile quintiles . Qualitative data analyze content analysis , involve identification common theme idea express response question semi-structured interview guide develop specifically address aim study .</detailed_description>
