	<brief_summary>In effort identify genetic factor link development nasopharyngeal cancer ( NPC ) , researcher identify sample 2,394 individual Taiwanese family two relative diagnose NPC . Serum individual test three anti-Epstein-Barr virus ( EPV ) antibody associate elevated risk NPC . Results indicate apparently healthy individual high-risk family nearly threefold elevation EBV antibody prevalence compare general population . However , clinical implication find yet understand . To clarify implication , 2,394 unaffected individual multiplex family study invite participate current study . Approximately 1,600 individual expect participate . Participants ear , nose , throat examination determine occult symptomatic NPC . Their level EBV antibody time initial recruitment correlate NPC detection period initial recruitment present study . Participants also ask complete brief risk factor questionnaire donate blood , saliva , nasopharyngeal swab , nasopharyngeal tissue , urine future study . Currently , accept clinical management protocol exist screen unaffected member family high risk NPC development . Results study potential significantly impact clinical management follow-up individual family history NPC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Defining Clinical Utility EBV Antibody Screening Identify Individuals Susceptible Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma ( NPC ) Within High-Risk , Multiplex NPC Families</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose propose study evaluate clinical utility serum EBV antibody test identification individual increase risk nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) within high-risk , NPC multiplex family . 2,394 unaffected individual Taiwanese family , two relative diagnose NPC , identify sampled part ongoing collaboration identify genetic factor link NPC development . Serum individual test three anti-EBV antibody ( VCA IgA , EBNA1 IgA , anti-DNase ) know associate elevate risk prevalent incident NPC general population study . Results test study population indicate apparently healthy individual high-risk multiplex family near 3-fold elevation EBV antibody prevalence compare EBV antibody prevalence observe general community EBV marker . However , clinical implication apparent elevation EBV antibody reactivity yet understood . Therefore , propose evaluate whether individual within previously conduct high-risk family study elevation EBV antibody level increase risk incident NPC . Individual marker ( VCA IgA , EBNIA1 IgA anti-DNase antibody ) combination marker evaluate determine performance screen test NPC risk high-risk multiplex family . To achieve goal , propose invite 2,394 unaffected individual multiplex family study , define family great equal 2 NPC . As result recruitment effort , expect approximately 1,600 subject participate ear , nose , throat ( ENT ) examination expert otolaryngologist determine whether individual occult symptomatic NPC . We correlate three EBV antibody screen test perform time initial recruitment family study NPC detection period initial recruitment family study present study ( median time original EBV antibody test clinical evaluation = 5.5 year ; range = le 1 year - 10 year ) . In addition histopathological specimen collect NPC diagnosis , participant study ask agree brief risk factor questionnaire donate blood , saliva , nasopharyngeal swab , nasopharyngeal tissue , urine future study . No accept clinical management protocol exist screen unaffected member family high-risk NPC development . Results study potential significantly impact clinical management follow-up individual family history NPC .</detailed_description>
