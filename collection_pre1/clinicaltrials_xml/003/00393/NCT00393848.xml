	<detailed_description>Hip fracture among elderly major health concern . Nearly one-third elderly hip fracture patient die within 1 year injury . Events surround actual injury necessary surgical repair often lead reduce muscle protein , eventually , muscle strength . Loss everyday function independence may follow , especially elderly frail individual . The decrease protein synthesis may cause two main event follow injury surgery : prolonged inactivity increase stress hormone level . Preventing loss protein may help improve outcome individual undergo hip surgery rehabilitation . The purpose study determine effect two postoperative intervention design retain muscle protein major hip knee surgery adults . This study include two experiment . Experiment 1 include individual schedule hip knee replacement surgery osteoarthritis ( need repair replace affected joint ) , avascular necrosis ( bone tissue death cause lack blood supply ) . Experiment 1 participant randomly assign one two group : - Group 1 participant receive daily supplement essential amino acid , think stimulate protein synthesis . - Group 2 participant receive standard rehabilitation care hospital serve control effect time recovery . Participants hospital 4 day . On morning surgery , blood urine collection occur . During surgery , substance call tracer , measure extent protein synthesis breakdown , inject vein first metabolic study . Additional blood muscle sample also take . After surgery , participant arrive surgical recovery unit able eat , begin record food intake receive assign treatment . Treatment , form gel capsule , take 2.5 hour meal . Urine collect throughout hospitalization blood collect morning . Prior discharge , 24-hour metabolic study perform , include tracer injection muscle biopsy . After discharge , participant provide 6 week ' worth assign treatment . Follow-up visit occur 2 ~6 8 week surgery . These visit include various muscle function physical performance test . Participants also undergo dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) scan , use determine muscle mass . Experiment 2 participant include individual schedule either hip knee replacement surgery fracture repair surgery . Participants randomly assign one two group : - Group 1 participant receive antifungal drug ketoconazole , think reduce level stress hormone cortisol . - Group 2 participant receive placebo standard rehabilitation care hospital . Participants begin take assigned treatment day prior surgery ; hip fracture take assigned treatment least 4 hour prior surgery . The procedure occur Experiment 1 surgery hospitalization carry Experiment 2 . The second metabolic study , however , last 1 hour include standard clinical meal .</detailed_description>
