	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate child adolescent Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) respond treatment three differ dos stimulant medication use treat ADHD , Adderall XR® Focalin XR® . Another purpose study evaluate difference sleep side effect , change mood loss appetite , occur stimulant medication . A third purpose determine difference characteristics individual respond good either medication . This research do investigator know one two commonly use treatment well tolerate . Children adolescents ADHD often hard time sit still , play quietly , finish thing start , pay attention , wait turn , distract others . These medication improve symptom , sometimes affect sleep , appetite , mood .

	<detailed_description>ADHD often treat stimulant medication , demonstrate short-term efficacy numerous trial . However , treatment often discontinue prematurely . Although ADHD often persist adolescence , approximately half child treat stimulant medication discontinue treatment within one year ( Charach , Ickowicz et al . 2004 ) .

Other frequent stimulant side effect decrease appetite mood lability ( dysphoria/euphoria ) .

There preliminary data short act stimulant suggest high prevalence sleep appetite problem amphetamine relative mph ( Pelham , Aronoff et al . 1999 ) . Several study indicate sleep stimulant side effect dose relate ( Stein , Sarampote et al . 2003 ) , although find study . Moreover , unclear difference long-acting amphetamine methylphenidate base stimulant side effect profile tolerability . Thus , directly compare two long act stimulant medication side effect profile tolerability , include measure sleep , mood , even behavior ( e.g. , family conflict ) .
