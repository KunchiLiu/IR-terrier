	<criteria>Histologic/cytologic diagnosis urothelial carcinoma ( transitional cell carcinoma either pure mixed histology ) All patient must receive four six cycle standard first line chemotherapy ( protocol detail suggest combination ) treatment locally recurrent metastatic disease AND must achieve stable disease ( SD ) , partial response ( PR ) , complete response ( CR ) chemotherapy . Type response , number cycle specific regimen give must carefully record submitted time registration . Reports pre post treatment image required time registration document response . Patients must register within 1 month ( next business day fall weekend holiday ) scan demonstrate stable disease well 42 day receive last standard chemotherapy dose . For example , patient receive treatment day 1 8 cycle , day 8 last cycle would consider last standard chemotherapy dose . Patients may receive previous adjuvant neoadjuvant therapy . No prior antiangiogenic therapy stage disease . Major surgery within 4 week start study treatment . NCI CTCAE grade 3 hemorrhage high within 4 week start study treatment . History known spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , evidence symptomatic brain leptomeningeal disease screen CT MRI scan . However treat , stable asymptomatic brain metastasis allow . Known HIV positive patient may participate . This avoid additional complication immune suppression HIV infection may cause due intense nature chemotherapy trial . Any follow within 6 month prior study administration : myocardial infarction , severe/unstable angina , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft , symptomatic congestive heart failure ( CHF ) , cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack , pulmonary embolism . Patients history suspect CHF include long asymptomatic ejection fraction equal institutional low limit normal baseline MUGA ( obtain within one month registration next business day fall weekend holiday ) . Ongoing cardiac dysrhythmias NCI CTCAE Grade &gt; 2 . Unresolved bacterial infection . Uncontrolled hypertension . Preexisting thyroid abnormality control medically . Concurrent treatment another clinical trial . Pregnant breastfeeding</criteria>
