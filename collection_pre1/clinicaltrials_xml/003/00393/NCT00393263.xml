	<brief_summary>Lichen sclerosus ( LS ) skin condition external genitals ( vulva ) woman . LS cause vulvar itching , pain , burn . In addition , LS cause scar vulva may cause significant sexual dysfunction pain . Lastly , 4-6 % woman LS develop vulvar cancer . The current `` gold standard '' treatment lichen sclerosus ultra-potent topical corticosteroid . When properly administer , topical ultra-potent corticosteroid help resolve symptom itch burn prevent vulvar scar . In addition , proper treatment revers underlie inflammation LS , preliminary data show risk cancer also decline . While effective , topical corticosteroid serious local systemic side effect include thin skin , superimpose fungal infection , suppression adrenal gland . Elidel 1 % cream new type medication approve FDA treatment eczema . In theory , Elidel also treat LS without serious side effect accompany corticosteroid . Therefore , study design compare effectiveness safety topical corticosteroid ( clobetasol ) versus Elidel 1 % cream treatment LS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clobetasol Versus Pimecrolimus Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lichen sclerosus ( LS ) chronic cutaneous disorder affect approximately one seventy woman . Presenting symptom may include intense pruritis , pain , burning , severe dyspareunia . The typical lesion LS white plaque papule , often area echymosis , excoriation , ulceration . Often , LS cause destruction vulva architecture . In addition , 4-6 % percent woman LS develop vulvar carcinoma . The histopathologic change LS distinctive make biopsy useful diagnostic tool . While known cure LS , current gold standard treatment ultra-potent corticosteroid . When properly administer , topical ultra-potent corticosteroid help resolve symptom pruritis burn prevent vulvar scar . In addition , proper treatment revers underlie histopathologic change LS , preliminary data show risk malignant transformation also decline . Although treatment topical corticosteroid effective , topical corticosteroid serious local systemic side effect , include dermal thinning , skin atrophy , superimpose fungal infection , rebound dermatitis , adrenal insufficiency . Pimecrolimus cream 1 % ( Elidel® , Novartis Pharmaceutical ) topical calcineurin inhibitor bind macrophilin-12 inhibits cytokine synthesis T lymphocytes . Elidel approve FDA treatment mild moderate atopic dermatitis . In theory , Elidel inhibit T lymphocyte , effectively treat lichen sclerosus . In addition , Elidel inhibit keratinocytes , affect collagen synthesis , cause dermal atrophy . Therefore , Elidel may effective safer alternative treatment LS . This study design compare effectiveness safety Elidel 1 % cream versus ultra-potent corticosteroid ( clobetasol 0.05 % cream ) treatment vulvar LS .</detailed_description>
