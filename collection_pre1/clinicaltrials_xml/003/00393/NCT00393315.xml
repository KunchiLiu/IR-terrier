	<detailed_description>Background information : Stent deployment treatment coronary artery stenoses evolved standard treatment nearly types coronary lesion past two decades.The initial recurrence rate bare stent range 20 30 % low risk stenosis reduce device passive coating silicon carbide , heparin , phosphorylcholine , carbon . The significant decline in-stent restenoses ( = ISR ) order 12 % achieve active coating like cell-cycle inhibitor sirolimus 13.7 % cytotoxic paclitaxel . Taken account one million annual stent procedure perform worldwide even low recurrence rate leave hundred thousand repeat procedure annually . In treatment in-stent restenoses , however , approach stand alone angioplasty conventional balloon , repeat use bare stent , cut balloon angioplasty , rotablation , atherectomy reveal unsatisfactory often conflict result . For brachytherapy late loss report range 0.22 +/- 0.84 mm 0.73 +/- 0.79mm . Due disadvantage delay endothelialization ensue late thrombosis cumulate 12-months cardiac event rate 30 % rise 50 % five year , decrease benefit time , cumbersome logistics site labs , brachytherapy consider valid approach future . Recently , deployment drug elute stent restenotic device associate restenosis rate range 4 % 30 % suggest advantage aforementioned approach . The wide range result late cardiac event still leave room alternative method Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter . Study Rationale The principle Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter base antiproliferative mode action compound , latter homogenously distribute along entire length balloon , hence , vessel segment treat . This advantage particular relevant comparison drug elute stent lack chronic mechanical alteration artery , ease access lesion , obviation add another layer metal lesion , presumably low cost procedure . Data use Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter treatment in-stent restenoses , however , scant . In animal model accord unpublished result human , proliferation induce Paclitaxel-eluting balloon catheter significantly less compare uncoated balloon Sirolimus-eluting Cypher™ stent.Therefore , prudent compare direct arterial application Paclitaxel mean Paclitaxel-eluting PTCA balloon catheter versus Paclitaxel-eluting Taxus™-stent percutaneous transluminal treatment option in-stent restenosis human coronary artery prospective randomize pilot study .</detailed_description>
