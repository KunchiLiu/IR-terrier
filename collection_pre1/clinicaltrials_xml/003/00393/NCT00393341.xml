	<detailed_description>Accumulating evidence emphasize emerge role circulate endothelial cell ( CECs ) endothelial progenitor cell ( EPCs ) tumor angiogenesis surrogate marker efficacy anti-angiogenic therapy breast cancer ( 22-27 ) . Furstenberger et al . ( 22 ) report CECs significantly elevate breast cancer patient decrease chemotherapy ( anthracycline and/or taxane base ) . However , EPCs ( CD34+/VEGFR-2+ ) well progenitor cell population CD133+/CD34+ population CD34+ stem cell increase together VEGF , erythropoietin angiopoietin-2 level . Their data suggest chemotherapy reduces mature CECs , mobilize EPC population . Using real-time PCR flow cytometry , also show CD146 , endothelial cell specific antigen , significantly increase newly diagnose breast cancer patient compare healthy control ( 23 ) . Other study also report increased circulating EPCs breast cancer patient addition CECs ( 24,25 ) . In another study , circulate EPCs increase cancer patient despite high plasma VEGF level ( 26 ) . Another interesting aspect Mancuso et al ( 27 ) show CEC kinetics correlate progression-free overall survival circulate progenitor cell metastatic breast cancer .</detailed_description>
