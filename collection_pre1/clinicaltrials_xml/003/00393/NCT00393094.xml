	<brief_summary>Background : - Bevacizumab genetically engineer antibody block growth new blood vessel tumor . It show activity human brain tumor laboratory test human clinical trial . - Irinotecan cause damage deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) cancer cell cell reproduce repair . It approve treat patient colorectal cancer . - Bevacizumab irinotecan combination effective colon cancer either drug alone . Objectives : - To determine safety bevacizumab irinotecan side effect associate combination two drug give patient high grade glioma . - To determine combination bevacizumab irinotecan help patient brain tumor grow treatment bevacizumab alone . Eligibility : -Patients 18 year age old treat National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) trial 06-C-0064 ( NCT00271609 ) , `` Bevacizumab Alone Recurrent Gliomas , '' whose tumor progress . Design : Participants receive infusion bevacizumab irinotecan vein every 2 week 4-week treatment cycle , plus follow procedure : - History , physical neurological examination every 2 week first treatment cycle every 4 week - Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan head every 4 week . - Routine lab every week . - Quality-of-life questionnaire every 4 week</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Bevacizumab humanize IgG1 monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) bind biologically active isoforms human vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF , VEGF-A ) high affinity ( kd = 1.1 nM ) . The antibody consist human IgG1 framework antigen-binding complementarity-determining region murine anti-VEGF MAb A.4.6.1 . - Irinotecan semisynthetic derivative camptothecin posse great aqueous solubility , great vitro vivo activity , associate less severe predictable toxicity camptothecin . - We propose treat patient whose tumor progress bevacizumab alone protocol combination bevacizumab irinotecan . We believe trial design significant power detect true synergistic effect two agent give single agent activity irinotecan low patient recurrent malignant glioma ( 2-5 % response rate ) patient treat trial tumor already progress bevacizumab . Objective : - To establish data safety regard anti-tumor activity bevacizumab plus irinotecan patient recurrent high-grade glioma progress bevacizumab alone determine objective radiographic response rate . - To determine 6 month progression-free survival treat patient characterize pattern change number endothelial progenitor cell time across patient . - To obtain preliminary data regard response treatment ( stable disease radiographic response ) effect monthly measurement quality life study . Eligibility : - Patients must treat National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) trial 06-C-0064 ; bevacizumab alone recurrent gliomas evidence tumor progression magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . - Patients histologically proven intracranial malignant glioma . Design : -Patients treat bevacizumab intravenous injection dose 10mg/kg irinotecan dose 125 mg/m^2 patient non-enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( NEIAED ) 340 mg/m^2 patient enzyme-inducing anti-epileptic drug ( EIAED ) every two week 4-week cycle .</detailed_description>

Malignant glioma include glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , gliosarcoma , anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , anaplastic oligodendroglioma ( AO ) , anaplastic mixed oligoastrocytoma ( AMO ) , malignant astrocytoma NOS ( otherwise specify ) . Patients must evidence tumor progression MRI compute tomography ( CT ) scan . This scan perform within 14 day prior registration fix dose steroid least 5 day . If steroid dose increase date image registration new baseline magnetic resonance ( MR ) /CT require . The type scan , i.e. , MRI CT must use throughout period protocol treatment tumor measurement . Patients must great equal 18 year old , life expectancy great 8 week . All patient previously designate durable power attorney ( DPA ) ( patient deem treat physician impair questionably impaired way ability patient give inform consent questionable ) must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must Karnofsky performance status great equal 60 . Patients must 4 week since last bevacizumab treatment may receive form treatment ( i.e . radiation , chemotherapy , surgery , investigational therapy ) progressive tumor last bevacizumab treatment enrollment companion trial . Patients must adequate bone marrow function ( white blood cell ( WBC ) great equal 3,000/microl , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal to1,500/mm^3 , platelet count great equal 100,000/mm^3 ) , hemoglobin great equal 10 gm/dl ) , adequate liver function ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ( SGOT ) bilirubin le 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ) , adequate renal function ( creatinine le 1.5 mg/dL and/or creatinine clearance great equal 60 cc/min ) start therapy . These test must perform within 14 day prior registration . Eligibility level hemoglobin may reach transfusion . Patients must significant medical illness investigator 's opinion adequately control appropriate therapy would compromise patient ' ability tolerate therapy . This study design include woman minority , design measure difference intervention effect . Males female recruit preference gender . No exclusion study base race .
