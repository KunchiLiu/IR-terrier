	<brief_summary>This disease believe due immune cell , cell normally protect body , destroy bile duct liver . When duct damage , bile build liver damage liver tissue . Over time , disease cause cirrhosis may make liver stop working . This study design examine whether treat patient high dose Cyclophosphamide Fludarabine ( drug reduce function immune system ) CAMPATH-1H ( protein kill immune cell think cause PBC ) , follow return blood stem cell previously collect patient brother sister stop reverse disease . The purpose Cyclophosphamide , Fludarabine CAMPATH-1H decrease immune system . The purpose stem cell infusion restore blood production , severely impaired Cyclophosphamide , Fludarabine CAMPATH-1H , produce normal immune system longer attack body .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There randomization study . All subject determine eligible study treatment receive high dose cyclophosphamide , fludarabine CAMPATH-1H follow infusion allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell . The procedure subject undergo follow : 1 . Physician visit determine potential eligibility study . Subjects evaluate transplant physician . They complete physical examination provide full medical history visit . In addition , subject ask complete quality life Questionnaire . Finally , study describe detail transplant physician nurse consent form provide take home read . 2 . HLA Testing . In order proceed study , subject need HLA identical match sibling donor . The subject sibling need undergo HLA type order determine whether match Cord blood stem cell obtain New York Blood Center Cord Blood Registry internationally recognize registry , match available , Stemcyte , commercial registry specialize minority donor . One unit HLA match cord blood unit infuse day zero . 3 . Insurance verification . Subjects remain interested pursuing study treatment severe scleroderma follow progressive course proceed insurance verification phase . Third party payment self-pay must verify subject proceed . 4 . Consent form . Prior proceeding , appropriate signature obtain consent form . Subjects give opportunity ask question attend physician transplant nurse prior sign consent form . 5 . Pre-transplant testing . To determine final eligibility study , subject undergo series tests/procedures . These include : CXR , electrocardiogram , endoscopy , ultrasound liver gallbladder , transvenous liver biopsy , lymphopheresis , pulmonary function test , urinalysis , blood test include CBC ; chemistry ; liver kidney function test ; PT ; PTT ; AMA ; viral study , female , pregnancy test . Subjects also evaluate dentist Northwestern Memorial Hospital rule potential source infection . All pre-transplant test routine medical test do verify diagnosis insure adequate organ function absence viral illness would preclude safe transplant course . Allogeneic donor also need undergo test order determine eligibility proceed . Testing donor include history physical , electrocardiogram , CXR , urinalysis , CBC , chemistry , PT , PTT , viral study , female , pregnancy test . 6 . Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell collection . Allogeneic donor undergo routine procedure mobilization collection peripheral blood stem cell . This include subcutaneous administration G-CSF , self-administered outpatient , begin three day prior start peripheral blood stem cell harvest . The peripheral blood stem cell collect outpatient Blood Center fourth day G-CSF administration . A central line may place purpose first day leukopheresis . Leukopheresis continue daily basis ( four consecutive day ) adequate number peripheral blood stem cell collect . G-CSF continue administer leukopheresis complete . The pheresis catheter discontinue stem cell harvest complete . Processed cell frozen store reinfused conditioning regimen . 7 . Study treatment . Prior administration study treatment , subject double lumen PICC line place administration chemotherapy , IV fluid , blood product withdrawal blood sample . The placement central catheter routine medical procedure . Subjects undergo condition include 4 day intravenous fludarabine 4 day cyclophosphamide 2 day CAMPATH-1H . All drug FDA approve drug . The previously collect allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell reinfused follow completion condition regimen . 8 . Post-transplant follow-up . Subjects history physical transplant physician 6 month , 12 month , yearly 5 year . In addition , routine urinalysis blood test performed interval include CBC ; chemistry ; kidney liver function test ; AMA ; ultrasound liver gallbladder , transvenous liver biopsy , lymphopheresis , patient also ask complete SF-36 Questionnaire , NDDK-QA Questionnaire .</detailed_description>

If multiple HLA match donor available , preference give sex , CMV status , case cord blood higher nucleated cell count . AMA negative If HLA match sibling available , donor may HLA match cord blood . The minimum number cord blood nucleate cell available must 2X107/kg . To achieve number nucleated cell , two unit HLA match cord blood may utilize ( Wagner JE Blood 2005 Feb 1 ; 105 ( 3 ) : 13437 ) Exclusion criterion : Physiologic age &gt; 50 year old &lt; 18 year old ( except cord blood unit ) HIV positive Active ischemic heart disease heart failure Acute chronic active hepatitis Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus illness opinion investigator would jeopardize ability donor tolerate stem cell collection Prior history malignancy except localize basal cell squamous skin cancer ; Other malignancy patient judge cured local surgical therapy , ( limit ) head neck cancer , stage I II breast cancer consider individual basis Positive pregnancy test Psychiatric illness mental deficiency make compliance treatment inform consent impossible Major hematological abnormality platelet count less 100,000/ul , ANC less 1000/ul</criteria>
