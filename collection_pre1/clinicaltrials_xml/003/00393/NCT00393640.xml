	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether early start either breastfeed breast milk expression may positively affect milk production later lactation . 120 breastfeed mother recruit randomized 4 group ( 2 group preterm delivery ) 2 group term delivery . One group give breast pump pump early regularly . second group encourage breastfeed response baby 's cue . Breast milk sample collect end week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Regular Breast Milk Expression Help Establish Lactation After Delivery : Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initiation lactation woman depend growth glandular tissue breast ( mammogenesis ) differentiation mammary secretory epithelial cell ( lactocytes ) pregnancy ( lactogenesis I ) . After birth , continuous nourishment fetus mother via umbilical cord replace equally important intermittent nourishment mother 's breast . The onset copious milk production ( lactogenesis II ) closely coupled factor control birth process . In mother deliver pre-term , mammogenesis lactogenesis I may truncate close consideration must give physiological aspect complex process assist preterm mother establish successful lactation . In Singapore , problem restrict mother preterm baby . In nation-wide survey Health Promotion Board 2001 , inability produce enough breast milk state reason breastfeed 53 % mother two month birth . The hypothesis study early , regular complete empty breast hasten improve establishment lactogenesis II preterm term delivery . It aim compare effect early regular breast milk expression success time establishment lactogenesis II compare routine breastfeeding practice mother preterm term delivery . The second aim study effect early regular breast milk expression blood prolactin progesterone level woman preterm term delivery . The final aim study volume breast milk produce fed baby preterm term delivery . 80 woman preterm delivery ( 28 week 36 week gestation ) 80 woman term delivery ( 37 week gestation ) recruit randomised minimization stratification factor previous live birth breastfeed experience . Groups A C mother give breast pump start express within one hour delivery thereafter every two three hour besides breastfeed baby directly . Groups B D mother breastfeed accord routine hospital protocol . Standard postnatal nursing care follow . 7 day breast milk sample ( 1ml morning one ml evening ) collect end 8th day . The detail delivery , birth weight , neonatal condition collect prospectively birth . Mothers give neonatal feed diary record frequency amount breast milk express , frequency duration direct breast feed , fluid feed baby first week . They ask record perception breast milk flow establish . The baby weigh Day 7 . The primary outcome : 1 . Successful initiation lactation determine lactogenesis II markers 2 . Successful initiation lactation determine maternal perception 3. timing successful establishment lactogenesis II . All statistical analysis conduct SPSS 11.0 . The difference successful initiation lactation determine lactogenesis II marker successful initiation lactation determine maternal perception 2 group assess Chi-Square Fisher Exact test . A logistic regression analysis perform adjust relevant covariates . 2 sample t-tests perform determine difference 2 group time successful establishment lactogenesis II , volume colostrums milk express fed weight change baby 7 day birth normality assumption satisfy . Otherwise Mann Whitney U test apply . A multiple regression analysis carry take account relevant covariates . Statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 . Outcomes advantage project : 1 . If early regular expression breast milk speed improve chance successful initiation lactogenesis II , useful aid woman plan breastfeed baby , especially deliver prematurely . 2 . This study help u determine normal time establishment lactogenesis II Singaporean woman term preterm delivery . Validated precise breast milk marker lactogenesis II use compare simple maternal perception . This knowledge help dispel many myth regard Asian woman breastfeed . 3 . Currently , actual physiological nutritional requirement breastfed newborn know . In study , volume breast milk produce daily fed baby first week measure term preterm delivery . This correlated weight change newborns determine much breast milk neonate normally require .
