	<brief_title>Determining Responses Two Different Vaccines HIV HCV Infected Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals HCV HIV coinfection especially hard treat , result , account high rate death year . Because HCV HIV share transmission route , HCV/HIV coinfection common . Liver disease emerge significant cause death individual coinfected HCV HIV . Currently , mechanism HCV HIV interact HCV/HIV-coinfected individual , include infection affect immune response , poorly understood . Research suggest vaccination may prevent comorbidities associate HCV/HIV coinfection ; however , responses new vaccine antigens show impaired HCV HIV-infected individual . The purpose study identify innate adaptive immune defect present HCV-infected , HIV-infected , HCV/HIV-coinfected individual . This study evaluate whether innate adaptive immune defect predict response HBV neoantigen form diphtheria/tetanus toxoid immunization ( Decavac ) hepatitis A-hepatitis B immunization ( Twinrix ) . This study last approximately 24 week . Participants stratify one three arm , base HCV HIV status : - Arm A enroll HCV-infected individual HIV-uninfected - Arm B enroll HIV-infected individual HCV-uninfected - Arm C enroll HCV/HIV-coinfected individual Arms B C open enrollment Arm A . Opening enrollment Arm A determine accrual progress Arms B C evaluate ACTG Scientific Agenda Steering committee . All participant receive Decavac vaccination Day 0 , Twinrix vaccination Days 0 , 7 , 21 . Study visit occur around Days 0 , 7 , 21 , Weeks 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 ; visit include medical medication history , blood collection , physical exam . Medication treat HCV HIV provide study .</detailed_description>
