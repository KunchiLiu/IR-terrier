	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether injection HER2/neu DNA safe stimulates immune response . The immune system consist different kind cell substance help fight infection inflammation body . These antibody T-cells part immune system may also help fight tumor cell . One way make antibody stimulate T-cells inject patient preparation contain material may stimulate immune system . This process call immunization . We try immunize patient HER2/neu . In order participate trial , tumor must large amount HER2/neu surface . The injection patient receive trial piece DNA make bacteria contains gene rat HER2 . DNA material contain information need produce many substance body . The HER2 gene encodes protein know HER2 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Breast cancer patient AJCC Stage III metastatic ( AJCC Stage IV ) disease overexpress HER2 potentially eligible trial . Patients may measurable disease , evaluable disease without evidence disease . They may receive hormonal therapy may already receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) receive trastuzumab study . Patients must ALL feature list : AJCC Stage IV breast cancer ( histologically confirm ) evidence disease stable disease . Patients may either therapy hormone therapy and/or trastuzumab . OR AJCC Stage III breast cancer &lt; = 36 month post completion adjuvant therapy . Pathology slide must review Department Pathology MSKCC . HER2 overexpression FISH stain 3+ immunohistochemistry either primary metastatic tumor . Karnofsky performance status &gt; = 80 % . Patients must recover toxicity prior therapy , receive major surgery , radiation therapy , chemotherapy least 4 week prior entry trial . ( Ongoing hormonal therapy and/or trastuzumab administration permit . ) Age &gt; 18 year Pregnancy ( Women child bear potential must pregnant normal pregnancy test within 2 week start treatment . ) Woman may yet bear child sexually active men must use appropriate contraception course study . Patients must counsel become pregnant study . Patients must also counsel injection HER2 may unknown affect viability future fetus . Nursing Prior cumulative doxorubicin dose &gt; 360 mg/m2 Prior cumulative epirubicin dose &gt; 600 mg/m2 Other active cancer ( within prior five year , exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer ) . Inadequate organ function define follow : total white blood cell count &lt; 3,000 cells/mm3 platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &gt; 2 x upper limit normal History cardiac disease define follow : prior myocardial infarction history document congestive heart failure leave ventricular ejection fraction normal institutional range use medication treatment angina pectoris prior arrhythmia cardiac valvular disease require medication clinically significant History know immunodeficiency autoimmune disease . Any use medication ( e.g. , corticosteroid ) might make difficult patient complete full course treatment respond immunologically vaccines ground exclusion , discretion Principal Investigator coPrincipal Investigators . Previous breast cancer vaccine exposure Active CNS leptomeningeal tumor Active infection require antibiotic treatment Anticipated survival le 6 month</criteria>
