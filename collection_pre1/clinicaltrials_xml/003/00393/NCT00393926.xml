	<detailed_description>Typically , brain damage due stroke , affect arm weak suffering paralysis . As result , adult condition unable move impair arm well activity daily live . Our research focus understanding best improve ability arm move brain damage due stroke . We implement novel robot technology design eventual use home therapy device use software hardware technology design activity assess arm ability engage person therapy . We study prolong use device simple , functional , engage activity improve arm 's movement ability sustain motivation use arm repeat therapy session away supervision . Overall , establish whether use technology perform task less game-like functionally relevant drive make difference impair arm stroke . Two group stroke survivor follow complete therapy . We three main aim . In aim # 1 , determine whether therapy use functional task compare simple rote task lead significant increase use arm therapy arm improvement experience subject therapy . In aim # 2 , measure group engage less functional therapy monitor effort enjoyment training . This aim help u determine value fun training . In aim # 3 , upgrade technology use home therapy environment follow subject determine result change supervised condition ( home )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects include study basis follow criterion : They must least six month poststroke . 18 year age old clinical diagnosis hemiparesis ( verified medical record medical expert ) . They voluntary control low medium range motion function ( UEFT &lt; 5 ) muscle tone . They functionally stable ( significant change motor function week ) able tolerate seat upright 90 minute . They report excessive pain impaired arm . If leave neglect spasticity detect impaired arm , level must interfere ability cognitively complete task turn wheel . They must participate experimental rehabilitation drug therapy . If subject receive chemical injection spasticity , must least 3months away last treatment . They must drive prior stroke . They clinically depress ( measure Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS ) short form ( Sheikh Yesavage , 1986 ) . Subjects exclude study voluntarily decide withdraw study meet inclusion criterion . Once informed consent give twentyfour subject randomize two train group ( fun driving : fun functional driving activity rote track ( 12 subject ) : rote functional tracking activity ) . Two subject randomize case study group . The group match initial motor function . Subjects exclude voluntarily decide withdraw study meet inclusion criterion .</criteria>
