	<brief_summary>Background : The p53 gene normally suppress tumor growth , mutate , damage , tumor grow unchecked . In cancer p53 gene mutate , increase level p53 ( overexpression p53 ) measure tumor . Objectives To determine whether advanced cancer overexpress p53 treat effectively lymphocytes ( white blood cell ) genetically engineer contain anti-p53 protein . Eligibility Patients 18 year age old metastatic cancer ( cancer spread beyond original site ) Patient 's tumor overexpresses p53 Patient 's leukocyte antigen type HLA-A 0201 Design Patients undergo follow procedure : Leukapheresis ( two occasion ) . This method collect large number white blood cell . The cell obtain first leukapheresis procedure grown laboratory , anti-p53 protein insert cell use inactivate ( harmless ) virus process call transduction . Cells collect second leukapheresis procedure use evaluate effectiveness study treatment . Chemotherapy . Patients give chemotherapy vein ( intravenously , IV ) 1 week suppress immune system patient immune cell interfere treatment . Treatment anti-p53 cell . Patients receive IV infusion transduce cell contain anti-p53 protein , follow infusion drug call IL-2 , help boost effectiveness transduced white cell . Patients may undergo tumor biopsy ( removal small piece tumor tissue ) . Patients evaluate laboratory test image test , compute tomography ( CT ) scan 4 6 week treatment month 3 4 month determine response treatment . Patients blood test 1 , 3 , 6 12 month annually next 10 year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Metastatic Cancer That Overexpresses P53 Using Lymphodepleting Conditioning Followed Infusion Anti-P53 TCR-Gene Engineered Lymphocytes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Human peripheral blood lymphocyte ( PBL 's ) engineer express alpha T-cell receptor recognize human leukocyte antigen serotype witin HLA-A A serotype group ) HLA-A2 . 1 restrict epitope derive p53 protein . We construct single retroviral vector contain alpha existent chain mediate genetic transfer TCR high efficacy ( le 30 % ) without need perform selection . In co-cultures HLA-A2 p53 double positive tumor include melanoma , hepatoma , sarcoma , small-cell lung cancer , esophageal breast tumor , p53-TCR transduce T cell secrete significant amount IFN- ( significant secretion observe control co-cultures either HLA-A2+/p53- HLA-A2-p53+cell line . Additional secretion cytokine ( IL-2 , IL-4 , IL-10 , granulocyte macrophage stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) , tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFalpha ) ) chemokines ( regulate upon activation , normal T cell express secrete ( RANTES ) , macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha ( MIP-1 alpha ) ) also observe co-cultures HLA-A2+/p53+tumor line . p53-TCR transduce PBL could efficiently kill HLA-A2 , 1/p53 express tumor ( H2087 , MDA-MB 231 , Saos2/143 , BE-3 ) . In addition , also test specific lysis normal tissue p53-TCR transduce cell little lysis normal fibroblast , renal epithelium cell , rest activate normal PBLs compare control HLA_A2+/p53+H2087 tumor . Objectives : Primary objective : Determine administration anti-p53 TCR-engineered peripheral blood lymphocyte aldesleukin patient follow nonmyeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic cancer overexpressing p53 . Secondary objective : Determine vivo survival TCR gene-engineered cell . Determine toxicity profile treatment regimen . Eligibility : Patients HLA A0201 18 year age old must metastatic cancer whose tumor overexpress p53 ; previously receive non-responder recurred standard care metastatic disease ; biopsy available evaluate p53 expression ; normal value basic laboratory value ; Patients may : concurrent major medical illness ; form primary secondary immunodeficiency ; severe hypersensitivity agent use study ; contraindication high dose aldesleukin administration . Design : PBMC , obtain leukapheresis ( approximately 5 x 10^9 cell ) culture presence anti-CD3 Muromonab-CD3 ( OKT3 ) IL-2 order stimulate T-cell growth . Transduction initiate exposure approximately 10^8 5 x 10^8 cell supernatant contain anti-p53 TCR retroviral vector . These transduced cell expand tested anti-tumor activity . Patients receive nonmyeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regiment consist cyclophosphamide fludarabine follow intravenous infusion vitro tumor reactive , TCR gene-transduced PBL plus IV aldesleukin ( 720,000IU/kg q8h maximum 15 dos ) . Patients undergo complete evaluation tumor physical examination , CT chest , abdomen pelvis clinical laboratory evaluation four six week treatment monthly approximately 3 4 month study criterion meet . Patients enter two cohort base histology : cohort 1 include patient metastatic melanoma renal cell cancer , cohort 2 include patient type metastatic cancer . For 2 stratum evaluate , study conduct use phase II optimal design initially 21 evaluable patient enrol . For two arm trial , 0 1 21 patient experience clinical response , patient enrol 2 first 21 evaluable patient enrol clinical response , accrual continue total 41 evaluable patient enrol stratum . For stratum , objective determine combination high dose aldesleukin , lymphocyte deplete chemotherapy , anti-p53 TCR-gene engineer lymphocyte able associated clinical response rate rule 5 % ( p0=0.05 ) favor modest 20 % PR + CR rate ( p1=0.20 ) .</detailed_description>
