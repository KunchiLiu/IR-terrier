	<detailed_description>This study design assess safety preliminary efficacy five different dos DTA-H19 give six intravesical infusion bladder patient superficial bladder cancer [ stag Ta carcinoma situ ( CIS ) ] fail intravesical therapy Bacille Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) . The primary safety outcome measure maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . DTA-H19 DNA plasmid contain H19 gene regulatory sequence drive expression intracellular toxin [ diphtheria toxin A ( DTA ) chain ] . This Patient-Oriented , Targeted Therapy DTA expression trigger presence H19 transcription factor find bladder tumor normal bladder cell . A maximum 18 patient histologically confirm H19 positive superficial bladder cancer multiple recurrent stage Ta tumor CIS include study . Patients grade 3 , stage T1 high stage , exclude . This multicenter , dose escalation study , eligibility criterion meet , patient five group 3 patient , receive escalate dos DTA-H19 intravesically seven-week period . Treatments give weekly three week follow one week later safety disease assessment , another 3 weekly instillation perform . Each dose cohort receive dose treatment . The first dose cohort receive 2 mg DTA-H19 plasmid per intravesical treatment treatment . The next dose cohort 3 patient receive 4 mg , next 6 mg , next 12 mg , final dose cohort receive 20 mg DTA-H19 plasmid DNA . All dose mixed polyethylenimine ( PEI ) improve transduction efficiency . Doses escalate none first three patient precede dose cohort experience dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) first three weekly intravesical treatment . Clinical response assess 4 , 8 , 12 week start treatment . If stage Ta marker lesion still present week 12 assessment , resect transurethral resection ( TUR ) . Patients whose disease progress ( i.e. , new lesion , increase size marker lesion , least 50 % , increase stage grade 3 ) offer continue monthly treatment follow-up one year</detailed_description>
