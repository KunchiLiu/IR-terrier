	<brief_summary>This study test ability magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) detect damage different part brain patient multiple sclerosis see cognitive problem patient correlate presence lesion reduction size certain part brain . Healthy subject also study compare finding patient normal volunteer . Healthy subject patient multiple sclerosis 18 60 year age may eligible study . Patients must severe clinical disability must receive respond Interferon beta least 6 month prior enrollment . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , MRI possibly evoke potential testing , measure nervous system response visual , auditory somatosensory stimulation . Participants two MRI scan within 1 week ( inclusive one perform screening ) . MRI use magnetic field radio wave obtain image body tissue organ . The scanner metal cylinder surround strong magnetic field . During MRI , subject lie table slide cylinder . Participants test magnet strength 1.5 3 Tesla ; high Tesla , great ability see brain change . Each scan may last 90 minute . In addition MRI scan , participant undergo cognitive testing measure memory think process complete form test quantify fatigue level , stress , anxiety depression</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The study evaluate cognitive impairment patient multiple sclerosis ( MS ) correlate degree cognitive dysfunction identify score obtain multiple cognitive test measurement cortical thickness , cortical lesion white matter disease magnetic resonance imaging brain MS individual . STUDY POPULATION : Study population consist 49 patient relapse remit secondary progressive MS superimpose relapse treat Interferon beta fully tolerate dosage least six month , 49 healthy volunteer match gender , age educational level . We expect screen 65 individual per arm order able enroll 49 individual per arm , thus meeting requirement sample size calculation . DESIGN : After screen clinical ( rating disability mean Expanded Disability Status Scale [ EDSS ] score ) , neurophysiological ( e.g . evoked potential test ) image examination , MS patient healthy subject undergo neuropsychological evaluation use Minimal Assessment Cognitive Function Multiple Sclerosis ( MACFIMS ) Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics ( ANAM ) , also 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . After 25 % 50 % project patient enrol , distribution MACFIMS evaluate ensure broad spectrum cognitive ability represent . Cortical thickness , cortical lesion white matter damage metric ( e.g . lesion load , diffusion tensor magnetization transfer MRI measure ) compute . In order exclude hypothesis presence fatigue , anxiety depression , normally occur MS patient , might interfere cognitive performance , thus act confound factor , scale measure fatigue mental status administer subject . Scores obtain scale use covariates statistical analysis perform present study account possible effect . OUTCOME MEASURES : The first outcome measure MACFIMS cortical thickness value . Correlation two metric initially perform . Secondly , cortical lesion well white matter lesion T1 T2 weight image , magnetization transfer ratio diffusion tensor image metric lesional normal appear brain tissue compute impact determine cognitive impairment determine . Thirdly , deep gray matter , white matter total brain volume measure compute correlated cognitive function measure MACFIMS . Similarly , correlation clinical disability , measure EDSS score cognitive impairment , well EDSS score RMI variable explore study perform . Finally , level correlation MACFIMS ANAM test investigate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PATIENT INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis relapse remit secondary progressive superimpose relapse MS. Age 18 60 , inclusive . EDSS 0 6.5 . Receiving treatment Interferon beta ( either 1a 1b ) fully tolerate dose least 6 month prior enrollment evidence clinical efficacy ( i.e . reduction absence clinical relapse ) time enrollment . PATIENT EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Clinical relapse time enrollment within previous 3 month . Undergoing chronic therapy immunomodulatory immunosuppressive medication ( exclude standard dosage steroids intravenously/intramuscularly inject orally take treatment relapse ) besides Interferon within past 6 month . Currently take medication use treatment cognition/fatigue Donepezil ( Aricept ) , Modafinil ( Provigil ) , Amantadine , drug may act temporary stimulant depressant central nervous system . Currently take medication use symptomatic relief may affect cognition . The study neurologist make determination eligibility . Clinically significant medical condition , opinion investigator , would compromise patient 's safety affect his/her MRI ( e.g. , diabetes mellitus , chronic hypertension , severe anemia , kidney disease , heart disease [ angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ] ) . Pregnancy current breastfeeding . Previous eye surgery kind . Inability provide inform consent . The ability patient understanding aspect protocol judge mean questionnaire . Permanent tattooed makeup ( eyeliner , lip , etc . ) general tattoo . Subjects tattoos exclude dangerous location body make color whose content iron ( e.g . dark blue dark green ) definitely rule Investigators . Any nonorganic implant device : cardiac pacemaker , insulin infusion pump , implant drug infusion device , cochlear , otologic , ear implant , transdermal medication patch ( nitro , hormone ) may cause problem remove , even temporarily , metallic implant object , body piercing ( ) , bone/joint pin , screw , nail , plate , wire suture surgical staple , shunt . Cerebral aneurysm clip . Shrapnel metal imbed patient 's body ( war wound accident ) . Previous work metal field machine may leave metallic fragment near patient ' eye . A severe auto accident past uncertain metal may still imbed patient 's body . Any psychological contraindication MRI ( e.g. , suffer claustrophobia ) . This assessed time medical history collect . Any contraindication study procedures do . HEALTHY VOLUNTEER INCLUSION CRITERIA : Age 18 60 . Vital sign find within normal range time screen visit . HEALTHY VOLUNTEER EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Clinically significant medical condition , opinion investigator , would compromise patient 's safety affect his/her MRI ( e.g. , diabetes mellitus , chronic hypertension , severe anemia , kidney disease , heart disease [ angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ] ) . Pregnancy . Previous eye surgery kind . Inability provide inform consent . Permanent tattooed makeup ( eyeliner , lip , etc ) general tattoo . Subjects tattoos exclude dangerous location body make color ( e.g . dark blue dark green ) whose content iron definitely rule Investigators . Any nonorganic implant device : cardiac pacemaker , insulin infusion pump , implant drug infusion device , cochlear , otologic , ear implant , transdermal medication patch ( Nitro , hormone ) may cause problem remove even temporarily , metallic implant object , body piercing ( ) , bone/joint pin , screw , nail , plate , wire suture surgical staple , shunt . Cerebral aneurysm clip . Shrapnel metal imbed subject 's body ( war wound accident ) . Previous work metal field machine may leave metallic fragment near subject 's eye . A severe auto accident past uncertain whether metal may still imbed subject 's body . Any psychological contraindication MRI ( e.g. , suffer claustrophobia ) . This assessed time medical history collect . Any contraindication study procedures do .</criteria>
