	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) prevalent disorder military sample associate adverse emotional health impact enormous health care cost , often resistant treatment . Identification PTSD-related factor contribute poor clinical health outcome imperative refine treatment strategy . Post deployment -related sleep disturbance constitute one factor contribute poor clinical health outcome . PTSD symptom persist sleep , little clinical attention typically devoted nighttime symptom . Other deployment relate stress reaction associate sleep disturbance . Sleep disturbance resistant traditional PTSD treatment . There emerge evidence adjunct sleep-focused intervention ( pharmacological behavioral ) associate improvement sleep , daytime symptomatology , general emotional well , function . Therefore , sleep focus intervention may enhance treatment response clinical outcome individual expose trauma consequent sleep disturbance . However , efficacy durability adjunct sleep intervention formally evaluate compare . In study , aim compare efficacy durability intervention target sleep disturbance occur relation military service military deployment . The overarch objective study investigate compare efficacy durability adjunct sleep-focused intervention sleep , daytime PTSD symptomatology , mood sample 90 male female veteran experience nightmare insomnia . The specific aim hypothesis : 1 . To investigate efficacy prazosin , integrate behavioral sleep intervention ( IBSI ) , placebo ( PLA ) post deployment-related sleep disturbance ; 2 . To compare efficacy pharmacological behavioral intervention adjunct sleep focused intervention ; 3 . To evaluate compare durability active sleep-focused intervention sleep , daytime PTSD symptom , mood , anxiety conduct naturalistic follow-up assessment 4 month end-of-treatment assessment . A secondary aim identify demographic , psychosocial , clinical predictor sleep treatment response military veteran . Participants recruit Pittsburgh VA Health Care System clinic service . Treatments administer eight-week period condition . Primary outcome measure include ( 1 ) Sleep Quality determine polysomnographic ( sleep ) recording , global score Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index ( PSQI ) PSQI Addendum PTSD ( PSQI-A ) .

Secondary outcome measure include PTSD symptom severity determine Clinician-Administered PTSD scale , Part 2 , self-report PTSD Symptom Checklist-Military version ; depression severity ( determine Beck Depression Inventory ) anxiety ( Beck Anxiety Inventory ) , ( 4 ) health-related quality life ( SF-36 ) . A naturalistic follow-up assessment conduct four month post-treatment . The propose study contribute development effective therapeutic strategy PTSD . This study provide novel information regard predictor sleep treatment response PTSD , contribute facilitate care management PTSD .</detailed_description>
