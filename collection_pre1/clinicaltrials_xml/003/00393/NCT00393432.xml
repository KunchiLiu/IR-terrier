	<brief_summary>This study determine brain learn new motor task subject practice task watch others perform ( action observation ) time . Healthy normal volunteer 18 55 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , general neurological exam , brain MRI one do within 12 month enter study . Participants undergo one follow experiment : 1 . Effect Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Motor Training Action Observation Subjects participate least 12 4-hour test session , separate least 1 day . Each session include follow : - Functional MRI ( fMRI ) : MRI scan us magnetic field radio wave produce image brain . For fMRI , subject performs task scan allow researcher see brain change occur performance activity . - Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) : For test , wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil stimulate brain . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , subject may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . During stimulation , subject ask : 1 ) perform training task ( make brisk thumb movement ) ; 2 ) watch video show hand another person perform task ; 3 ) perform task watch video time , synchronize movement observe video . - Surface electromyography : Electrodes fill conductive gel tap skin hand muscle measure electrical activity muscle . - Behavioral measurement : Evaluation learn movement task . - Questionnaires test attention , fatigue mood , test session . 2 . Effect Pharmacological Agents Motor Training Action Observation Subjects participate 12 5-hour test session , separate least 2 day . In course 12 session , subject receive three medication - dextromethorphan , scopolamine rivastigmine - three time placebo ( pill active ingredient ) three time . During session , subject TMS measurement , behavioral measurement electromyography describe experiment 1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhancing Motor Task Training Action Observation Watching Others Perform Task</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor training ( MT ) elicit formation motor memory human primary motor cortex . Observing another individual perform motor training ( Action Observation , AO ) also result formation motor memory M1 . AO enhance motor training effect ( MT+AO ) formation motor memory . Possible underlying mechanism include long-term potentiation ( LTP ) , process influence N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor activation , gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , norepinephrine ( NE ) , dopamine acetylcholine ( Ach ) , take place confluence input PMv primary motor cortex ( M1 ) . The purpose protocol gain insight mechanism underlie motor memory formation MT+AO . We plan perform two different type experiment : In experiment 1 , modulate activity PMv use TMS investigate role cortical area motor memory formation induce MT+AO . In experiment 2 , test effect single dos ( ) NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphan , ( b ) muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine , know disrupt LTP , ( c ) cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine , enhance LTP . The primary outcome measure motor memory formation percentage TMS-evoked movement fall within train target zone ( TTZ ) MT+AO . The secondary outcome measure percentage TMS-evoked movement fall within TTZ MT alone AO alone . Expected result ( 1 ) upregulation activity PMv use 0.1 Hz TMS enhance motor memory formation induce MT+AO sham TMS downregulation PMv use 0.9 Hz TMS ( 2 ) dextromethorphan scopolamine decrease rivastigmine increase motor memory formation induce MT+AO placebo . This study may provide useful information mechanism underlie beneficial effect action observation neuroplasticity .</detailed_description>
