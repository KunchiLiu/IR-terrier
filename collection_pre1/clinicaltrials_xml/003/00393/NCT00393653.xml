	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether novel prescription method ( N-of-1 intervention ) successfully integrated primary care practice examine effect prescription method select patient health outcome ( e.g.. , medication compliance , medication cost , symptom management , satisfaction physician/patient visit , etc . ) patient uncontrolled new diagnosis Osteoarthritis Chronic Heartburn ( GERD ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current prescription write behavior physician largely inform decision base upon education experience . The physician typically assess sign symptom patient presentation , laboratory clinical test , factor may know physician ( e.g . inability swallow capsule , requirement direct sunlight extend period ) , choose drug prescribe evidence patient response agent prescribe . The prescribe physician may may decide validate decision additional test form follow-up visit procedure design assess effectiveness prescription arbitrary period time , comparatively available agent . Other influence may impact decision include aggressive promotion pharmaceutical company support late medication direct consumer retail advertising . Studies conduct University Washington Medical School show patient merely enquire drug 've see advertising , drug frequently prescribe ( Hollon 2005 ) . At best , prescription writing educate guess schedule follow-up verify result decision . At bad , may result risk benefit patient patient non-responder , patient accepts adverse outcome without inform physician . The Opt-e-scrip method determine prescription virtually method use assess new drug regulatory approval ( i.e. , control experiment reduce systematic error , reduce random variation , increase precision assessment ) . However , instead apply technique scientific investigation population , method apply individual patient . Opt-e-scrip 's proprietary method use assess alternative choice within therapeutic class effectiveness safety prescribe specific agent individual patient . In case , however , drug already market cost information available , two agent equally safe effective , decision make reliably cost relevant factor ( 2006 ) . Initial study indicate Opt-e-scrip methodology distinguish similar medication base efficacy and/or side effect individual patient level patient osteoarthritis , gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , allergic rhinitis ( Reitberg , Del Rio et al . 2002 ; Reitberg , Weiss et al . 2005 ) . It remain see well method integrated clinical care clinicians patient respond method part routine care . This project assess integration Opt-e-scrip method 20 primary care practice use method assist medication selection 30 40 patient new diagnosis uncontrolled osteoarthritis GERD . Specific Aims Study . - 1 . Evaluate whether ( N-of-1 ) intervention prescription method successfully integrated primary care practice . - 2 . Determine whether use intervention prescription method change medication selection patient osteoarthritis gastroesophageal reflux disease . - 3 . Examine effect intervention method medication compliance . - 4 . Examine effect intervention prescription method medication cost . References 1 . Hollon , M. F.
