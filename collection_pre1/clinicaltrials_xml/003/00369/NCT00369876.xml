	<brief_title>Anorexia Children With Burn Injury Reactions Immune Endocrine Systems</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Burn injury lead hypermetabolic set heal damage tissue.Burn heal us high energy consumption consequence highly There huge activation endocrine system immune system result proinflamtory status . The nutrition component important role burn heal process reduce healing time also quality scar tissue . It 's observe many burn injury patient suffer anorexia . Since know pro-inflammatory status modulate satiety rise question correlation level peptide immune endocrine system anorexia child burn injury . Catecholamines serum concentration rise follow burn injury . These hormone important role determine basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) . During heal process level growth hormone ( GH ) Insulin like growth factor I ( IGF-1 ) reduce . Previous study show correlation low level Interleukins cytokine Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) . Additional hormone , relevant , cortisol insulin . Cortisol level high severe burn injury long period . insulin sensitivity state also important role heal process . TNFa IL-6 , inflammatory factor , find significantly elevate serum concentration heal process . They also know reducer GH sensitivity cause anorexia . This study show connection immune endocrine system burn heal process anorexia examine level hormone , interleukin neuropeptide burn heal . goal try improve treatment child burn injury nutritional drug intervention .</detailed_description>
