	<brief_title>Targeted Naltrexone Problem Drinkers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 12-week , placebo-controlled trial naltrexone ( 50 mg orally ) 163 problem drinker . Problem drinker individual whose drinking put risk variety psychosocial medical problem , include alcohol dependence , physically dependent alcohol . They estimate comprise 20 % general population . The study employ factorial design effect medication ( naltrexone vs. placebo ) , schedule medication administration ( i.e. , daily vs. target ) , interaction factor drink behavior examine . Targeted administration refers use medication cope anticipate high-risk drinking situation . The daily monitoring use interactive voice response technology mood , desire drink , perceive self-efficacy , drink behavior make possible examine depth process study variable exert effect . Daily monitoring perform use automate telephone interview , in-person follow-up evaluation conduct 3 6 month post-treatment provide measure durability treatment effect . A pharmacogenetic analysis base preliminary evidence show functional polymorphism gene encode mu-opioid receptor ( OPRM1 ) affect response naltrexone serve explore important source variation response naltrexone treatment . Exploratory analysis involve potential genetic moderator response naltrexone , gene encode delta opioid receptor ( OPRD1 ) , also conduct , correlation genotype data phenotype . Careful evaluation study hypothesis provide important information efficacy mechanism effect target naltrexone problem drinker . This study allow u model effect across multiple level analysis effort understand psychopharmacological mechanism underlie therapeutic effect naltrexone problem drinker apply novel genetic finding understand pharmacogenetic mechanism underlie therapeutic effect naltrexone problem drinker .</detailed_description>
