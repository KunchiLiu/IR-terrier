	<brief_summary>The possibility use new drug elute stent ( DES ) technology significantly change mid-term outcome percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) term reduce recurrence angina . The way interventionalists accomplish work change accordingly , strong trend wider use DES consequent perceive patient ' clinical benefit . Evidences support superiority DES reduce ischemic recurrence PCI compare traditional stent ( BMS ) available randomized study . A recent meta-analyses underline : DES superior BMS reduce clinical recurrence ischemia , DES BMS offer identical result term death infarction , Rapamycin paclitaxel DES offer similar result . The aim study perform multicenter , randomize study assess clinical efficacy safety oral prednisone therapy PCI possible systemic alternative currently available BMS DES . Furthermore , study aim analyze clinical outcome commercially available DES context independent research cost-benefit comparison BMS oral steroid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design study It important underline `` spontaneous '' study , i.e . receive sponsorship pharmaceutical industry , stent manufacturer , financial source . This independence economic interest would contribute exclude conflict interest may bias result study aim test applicability clinical efficacy therapy . Furthermore , assessment DES public hospital , beyond spectrum industry-supported study may offer interesting result real life use device . One purpose study cost-effectiveness analysis . Centers participate study therefore perform PCI accord common practice interference decision-making process technical approach PCI inclusion patient randomize study ; aim obtain real possible situation daily practice . Being spontaneous research , neither fee provide enrollment patient , free stent give . The allocation patient BMS DES treatment decide randomization , stent implant select accord operator 's preference . The study include three different group patient : - Control group : receiving BMS ; - DES group : receiving DES ; - Prednisone group : receiving BMS oral prednisone Principal objective study : comparison primary endpoint obtain control group patient treat BMS versus two alternative study group : - DES - BMS oral prednisone All assume similar adjunctive conventional medical treatment . Secondary endpoint study : - cost-effectiveness analysis . This calculated consider patient enrol study analyze one year treatment . The analysis take account procedural cost PCI material , cost medical treatment first year follow-up number event-free day follow-up . The cost-efficacy analysis obtain ratio cost event-free day follow-up possibility MACE consider primary endpoint study . - comparison angiographic result . This calculated patient enrol .</detailed_description>
