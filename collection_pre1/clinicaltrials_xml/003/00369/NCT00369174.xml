	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone Maleate Treating Patients With Oral Leukoplakia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate clinical response oral premalignant lesion ( OPL ) 12 week therapy rosiglitazone ( Avandia ) , 8 mg daily , define great equal 50 % reduction measure product perpendicular dimension target lesion , improvement degree dysplasia . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate degree change putative biomarkers rosiglitazone efficacy include : COX-2 , cyclin D1 , Ki-67 , p21/waf1 , PPAR gamma , K1 cytokeratin , involucrin , transglutaminase expression , TUNEL . II . To estimate correlation DNA ploidy measurement OPL clinical response response biomarkers rosiglitazone therapy , estimate efficacy rosiglitazone therapy normalize aberrant DNA ploidy OPL . III . To thoroughly assess smoking pattern among trial participant examine relationship smoking treatment response . IV . To assess safety agent short-term use population . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label , nonrandomized study . Patients receive oral rosiglitazone daily . Treatment continue 12 week absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 week .</detailed_description>
