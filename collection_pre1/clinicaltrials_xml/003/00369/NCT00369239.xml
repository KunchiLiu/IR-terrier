	<brief_title>Treatment With Risperidone Long Acting Injectable ( RLAI ) Early Phase Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intervention antipsychotic medication early stage schizophrenia may result good outcome patient , high number patient achieve full remission , short time remission decrease risk relapse . In addition , evidence suggest critical window opportunity exist early period syndromal differentiation , pharmacological intervention intensive engagement patient may impact favourably symptom long term . The long-acting injectable formulation risperidone show improvement measure disease severity oral formulation , demonstrate improved safety tolerability profile low peak-trough level . A recent study demonstrate patient early phase illness ( 0-3 year ) benefit treatment RLAI . Although premorbid function accepted predictor outcome affect treatment adherence , prospective clinical data scarce . RLAI address problem adherence eliminate need daily medication intake . In study investigate whether patient good premorbid function respond well treatment RLAI compare patient poor premorbid functioning . Moreover , patient schizophrenia often fail acknowledge illness need treatment - so-called 'lack insight ' . Previous study investigate relationship acute psychopathology insight produce conflicting result . Multiple administration structure measure insight ( SAI-E ) symptom measure provide mean evaluate whether insight correlate clinical change , whether insight change time whether change insight relate change psychopathology . A physical examination perform , include heart rate , blood pressure , weight . Interviews assessment make complete standard rating scale ( Positive Negative Symptom Score ( PANSS ) , Scale Assessment Insight-Expanded version ( SAI-E ) , Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) , Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) , Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale ( ESRS ) ) . The Short-Form-36 questionnaire ( SF-36 ) complete patient . Any health problem medicine patient record . The primary hypothesis , patient `` Stable-good '' premorbid function good outcome `` Stable-poor '' premorbid functioning examine divide patient `` Stable-good '' `` Stable-poor '' premorbid function group base total score Premorbid Adjustment Scale ( PAS ) . Statistically significant difference `` Stable-good '' vs. `` Stable-poor '' pre-morbid group combine change measure 5 % level interpret support hypothesis . Association insight outcome examine use Scale Assessment Insight-Expanded version ( SAI-E ) insight item ( G 12 ) Positive Negative Symptom Score ( PANSS ) . Effectiveness [ Clinical Global Impression ( CGI-S/C ) , PANSS , retention rate ) , function [ Short-Form-36 questionnaire ( SF-36 , rehospitalisation rate ) ] safety tolerability assess . The observation period 6 month . RLAI give intramuscular injection every 2 week . The start dose RLAI accordance product label ( usually 25 mg ) . If necessary , dosage injection may increase gradually . Treatment duration 26 week . To ensure continue antipsychotic coverage main release risperidone microspheres , previous antipsychotic therapy continue concomitantly first three week study .</detailed_description>
