	<brief_summary>Our goal study relationship intraocular pressure robotic prostatectomy surgery visual deficiencies/vision loss surgery . We believe risk vision loss surgery due positioning operation , well abdominal carbon dioxide insufflation . As robotic procedure gain popularity , determine whether subject patient population , perhaps likely patient preoperative diagnosis glaucoma , increase likelihood postoperative visual disturbance.If hypothesis intraocular pressure increase patient confirm , future study assess therapeutic modality maintain IOP near baseline .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The frequency post-operative permanent vision loss recently estimate 1:61,0001,2 , although majority case involve surgical trauma eye brain . Prolonged vision loss attributable direct trauma estimate occur frequency approximately 1:125,0003 give broad classification term ischemic optic neuropathy . This rare catastrophic outcome commonly associate operation perform circumstance may increase intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , either due positioning4 due insufflation abdomen carbon dioxide ( laparoscopy ) .5 There two factor predispose robotic prostatectomy patient increase IOP : step head-down ( Trendelenburg ) position abdominal carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) insufflation . The Trendelenburg position increase central venous pressure within thorax , may reduce drainage blood flow head , thus increase IOP . The CO2 insufflation may increase IOP via two mechanism . First , increase intra-abdominal pressure increase intrathoracic pressure . Secondly , insufflation CO2 may increase carbon dioxide content blood , brain reacts vasodilating increase blood volume . Thus flow eye increase , flow eye decrease leading increase pressure inside eye eventually may reduce inflow enough cause retinal optic nerve ischemia . Because pressure within eye important factor determine blood flow eye , prevention dramatic increase IOP may make patient less vulnerable peri-operative ischemic optic neuropathy vision loss . Because permanent vision loss rare event surgery , study measure subtle ( likely , temporary ) vision change ( subjective blurriness , visual field deficit , decrease acuity ) , occur frequently thus easily measure outcome.6 As robotic procedure gain popularity , determine whether subject patient population , perhaps likely patient preoperative diagnosis glaucoma , increase likelihood postoperative visual disturbance .</detailed_description>
