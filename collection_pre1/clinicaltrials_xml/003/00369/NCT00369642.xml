	<detailed_description>Distressing , intrusive thought , image , impulse repetitive mental behavioral ritual aim reduce distress hallmark adult pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . Epidemiological study suggest prevalence rate 1 4 % child adolescent ( Douglass , Moffitt , Dar , McGee , &amp; Silva , 1995 ; Flament , Whitaker , Rapoport , &amp; Davies , 1988 ; Zohar , 1999 ) . If untreated , OCD relate significant social , academic , familial impairment ( Koran , Thienemann , &amp; Davenport , 1996 ; Piacentini et al. , 2003 ) . Cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) form psychotherapy proven efficacy OCD treatment adult population ( see Franklin &amp; Foa , 2002 review ) . More recently , several open ( Benazon , Ager , &amp; Rosenberg , 2002 ; March , Mulle , &amp; Herbel , 1994 ; Piacentini , Bergman , Jacobs , McCracken , &amp; Kretchman , 2002 ) one control trial ( de Haan , Hoogduin , Buitelaar , &amp; Keijsers , 1998 ) support effectiveness approach child adolescent diagnose OCD . Cognitive-behavioral therapy adult pediatric OCD break two general component . First , exposure response prevention ( ERP ) , patient gradually expose anxiety-provoking stimulus refrain engage compulsive behavior ritual ( Meyer , 1966 ) . The extended exposure anxiety-provoking stimuli cause anxiety habituate provide objective data contradicts inaccurate expectation harm responsibility ( Foa &amp; Kozac , 1996 ) . Second , cognitive therapy teach patient identify correct anxiety-provoking cognition often motivate compulsive behavior . Objective , realistic cognition link obsessive-compulsive anxiety result reduce need perform compulsive act . Although result mention psychotherapy trial , well number pharmacological treatment trial , promise ( Cook et al. , 2001 ; DeVeaugh-Geiss , Moroz , Biederman , &amp; Cantwell , 1992 ; Geller et al. , 2001 ; Liebowitz et al. , 2002 ; March et al. , 1998 ; Riddle et al. , 2001 ) , important note relatively large number patient respond treatment clinically significant manner . For example , treatment response rate recent major drug trial range 42 67 % ( Cook et al. , 2001 ; DeVeaugh-Geiss et al. , 1992 ; Geller et al. , 2001 ; Liebowitz et al. , 2002 ; Riddle et al. , 2001 ) , whereas treatment response rate reference psychotherapy trial range 63 79 % . As , important identify test potential treatment approach may suitable treatment refractory pediatric OCD patient . One manner treat child OCD adequately respond conventional medication psychotherapy intervention intensive CBT . The UF OCD Program Department Psychiatry University Florida utilizes principle CBT . Our intensive program provide CBT service child outpatient basis . Intensive outpatient treatment involve child his/her parent ( ) guardian ( ) move Gainesville three week , usually require stay hotel , unless person friend relatives live area . Patients see five day per week approximately three week . Sessions typically involve exposure response prevention conjunction cognitive therapy old child . Family member involve extensively treatment assist completion daily homework exercise generalization skills home environment . In addition alternative approach treatment refractory youth , number benefit intensive program pediatric OCD may offer . First , intensive approach may well suit child severe symptomatology functional impairment ( e.g. , go school ; Franklin , Tolin , March , &amp; Foa , 2001 ; Storch , Gelfand , Geffken , &amp; Goodman , 2003 ) . Second , exist outpatient intervention typically achieve treatment gain 15 20 week period . Intensive treatment typically last three four week , thus may present timely , cost-effective , efficient mean treatment , particularly child miss important normative event ( e.g. , school attendance ) . Third , many people access mental health professional train empirically grounded OCD treatment thus , unable receive effective care . For example , Flament et al . ( 1988 ) find 22 % sample child OCD receive mental health service . Moreover , none treat receive appropriate , empirically validate intervention . Finally , time-limited , intensive program may enhance child 's motivation become primary focus several week , may case standard weekly treatment ( Foa &amp; Steketee , 1987 ) . Although several open control trial intensive psychotherapy adult OCD publish ( Abramowitz , Foa , &amp; Franklin , 2003 ; Cottraux et al. , 2001 ; Foa , Kozak , Steketee , &amp; McCarthy , 1992 ; Storch et al. , 2003 ) , date , two example intensive outpatient treatment OCD childhood report ( Franklin et al. , 2001 ; Storch et al. , 2004 ) . Franklin et al . ( 2001 ) describe 12-year-old boy severe OCD see five day per week total 11 session . Results indicate marked improvement clinician-rated OCD symptom self-reported depressive symptom . Storch et al . ( 2004 ) provide data five child OCD consecutively see intensive cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy . Assessments conduct baseline treatment . All participant classify treatment responder ( much improve much improve ) . Two participant meet diagnostic criterion OCD follow treatment . The severity clinician-rated OCD symptom impairment significantly decrease intervention . Under propose control trial , plan examine efficacy daily cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy 50 consecutive child adolescent enroll UF OCD program . Children randomize one two treatment condition : one consist receive cognitive-behavioral therapy every weekday three-weeks ; consist receive treatment usual , consist per week outpatient cognitive-behavioral therapy session . As compare per week therapy condition , predict decrease OCD , general anxiety , depressive symptomatology , functional impairment post-intervention youth daily therapy condition .</detailed_description>
