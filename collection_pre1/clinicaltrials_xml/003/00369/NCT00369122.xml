	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together radiation therapy cisplatin work treat patient previously untreated locally advanced cervical cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth cervical cancer block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together radiation therapy cisplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine treatment-related serious adverse-event rate adverse-event rate within first 90 day treatment start patient previously untreated locally advanced carcinoma cervix treat bevacizumab , cisplatin , concurrent pelvic radiotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate treatment-related serious adverse event adverse event time . II . Evaluate disease-free survival ( local , regional , distant failure , death due cause ) . III . Evaluate overall survival ( death due cause ) . IV . Implement image-based brachytherapy guideline propose Transatlantic Image-Guided Brachytherapy Working Group . V. Collect CT scan MRI-based dosimetry brachytherapy application use course treatment later analysis feasibility consistency well dose/volume assessment tumor control complication . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients undergo pelvic external-beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) daily , 5 day week , 5 week total 45 Gy . Some patient also undergo low-dose rate brachytherapy twice , 1-3 week apart , begin &gt; = 4 week initiate EBRT high-dose rate brachytherapy 5 time , &gt; = 48 hour apart , begin &gt; = 2 week initiate EBRT . EBRT chemotherapy halt day high-dose rate brachytherapy . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 35 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
