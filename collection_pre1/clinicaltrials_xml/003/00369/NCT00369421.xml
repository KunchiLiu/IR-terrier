	<brief_summary>Researchers intend diagnose treat certain inborn error metabolism . By researcher hope expand knowledge disorder provide access patient interest research , teaching , clinical experience . Patients participate study examine treated patient basis , practical . However , patient require specialized test treatment admit NIH Clinical Center necessary . Researchers use accepted medical procedure diagnose ( medical history , physical examination , X-ray study , eye examination , blood test , urine test ) treat patient involve study . Additional test may require case case basis . Many patient see study go enrolled specific disease-related research study. &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnosis Treatment Patients With Inborn Errors Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose characterize etiology natural history rare inborn error metabolism genetic disorder , know yet-to-be discover . In , expand knowledge disorder provide access patient interest research , teaching , clinical experience . Individual patient see protocol prompted establishment specific disease-related protocol involve intensive natural history study innovative therapy . In addition longstanding role investigate individual interest Section Human Biochemical Genetics , protocol provide one possible avenue ( addition NIH protocol ) admit patient part NIH Undiagnosed Diseases Program .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion/Exclusion criterion Patients enrol protocol refer know suspected inborn error metabolism , heritable disorder , genetic predisposition . Examples include inherited developmental defect diatheses toward infection , cancer , environmentally induced disease . The principal investigator , along consult specialist , review medical record prospective subject offer admission base upon potential help individual , learn patient , initiate clinical basic research suggest patient workup . Prior late 2008 , patient enrol protocol disorder current potential future research interest Principal Investigator Associate Investigator . Approximately 400 patient enrol course 32 year . Beginning 2008 , protocol become one vehicle admit patient broad range inborn error metabolism ( e.g. , immune defect , developmental disorder , cancer diatheses , etc . ) NIH UDP . There several aspect process : 1 . &lt; TAB &gt; Screening triaging . Records review UDP Director completeness miss article ( e.g. , image , biopsy slide ) request . The UDP Director assign record review consultant base upon specialty involve , copy record distribute 15 expert . 2 . &lt; TAB &gt; Criteria eligibility . Eligibility criterion include novelty clinical finding , multiple family member affect , objective laboratory image clue pursue . Of course , patient able travel , well . 3 . &lt; TAB &gt; Roles UDP personnel . The UDP Director perform triage , make final decision , sign decision letter . The consultant NIH clinical specialist Clinical Center departments ICs . A group nurse practitioners one physician assistant communicate medical issue patient refer physician . Support personnel obtain miss article , copy record , file , send letter receipt , enter information Lab Matrix database , answer phone call . 4 . &lt; TAB &gt; Consent time process . In general , consent obtain care team upon admission . Occasionally , patient family member give consent blood draw locally ; obtain Associate Investigator phone writing . Patients apply summary letter refer physician medical record ; case review member large group NIH consultant . If consultant find applicant qualifies her/his protocol ( institute ) , patient invite enroll protocol . The UDP connect patient principal investigator ; involvement protocol 76HG0238 . For patient select service , UDP Director , base largely specialist recommendation , make final decision regard acceptance rejection respect protocol 76HG0238 . The UDP evolve majority patient enrol 76HG0238 . Once patient enrol 76HG0238 , her/his management regardless whether entry UDP . Specifically , case , test except skin biopsy , DNA analysis , research blood medically indicate directed toward diagnosis . Some subject relatives patient know diagnosis , specimen obtain purpose heterozygote test serve control help diagnose proband . All subject shall admit inpatient outpatient discretion principal investigator , base upon particular research interest expertise . Individuals exclude protocol already diagnosis , previous evaluation leave clue pursue , appear know diagnosis make , subjective complaint far exceed objective finding . We admit patient one month age protocol . This exclusion occur urgency early diagnosis care readily proffer old individual Clinical Center . Patients one year age admit medically stable require admission Clinical Center diagnosis . Normal adult volunteer enrol provide control blood urine specimen . NIH employee member immediate family may participate protocol normal volunteer . We follow Guidelines Inclusion Employees NIH Research Studies give employee copy NIH information sheet Employee Research Participation . For NIH employee : 1 . Neither participation refusal participate effect , either beneficial adverse , participant employment work situation . 2 . The NIH information sheet regard NIH employee research participation distribute potential subject NIH employee . 3 . The employee subject privacy confidentiality preserve accordance NIH Clinical Center policy , define scope limitation protection . 4 . For NIH employee subject , consent obtain individual independent employee team . Those supervisory position 12 employee coworkers employee obtain consent . 5 . The importance maintain confidentiality obtain potentially sensitive private information coworkers subordinate bereviewed study staff least annually often warrant .</criteria>
