	<brief_title>VEGF Trap Treating Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess antitumor activity VEGF Trap , term tumor response rate , patient metastatic breast cancer receive = &lt; 2 prior chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease , include taxane and/or anthracycline . II . Assess 6-month progression-free survival rate patient treat VEGF Trap . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe adverse event profile ( grade use NCI CTCAE version 3.0 ) VEGF Trap patient . II . Describe progression-free survival time patient treat VEGF Trap . III . Describe overall survival patient treat VEGF Trap . IV . Describe duration response patient treat VEGF Trap . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive VEGF Trap IV 1 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
