	<brief_title>VEGF Trap Treating Patients With Recurrent Malignant Gliomas That Did Not Respond Temozolomide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine therapeutic efficacy VEGF Trap patient temozolomide-resistant malignant glioma first recurrence measure 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . Determine safety profile VEGF Trap patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine efficacy regimen measure radiographic response , PFS , time progression , overall survival . II . Characterize single-dose repeated-dose pharmacokinetic profile VEGF Trap patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord histology ( glioblastoma v anaplastic glioma ) . Patients receive VEGF Trap IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
