	<brief_title>A Study Test Safety Efficacy Erlotinib Plus Bevacizumab Treat Advanced Thymoma Thymic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We believe EGFR pathway , well tumor angiogenesis play important role pathogenesis thymic neoplasm . Our previous experience EGFR inhibitor gefitinib show promising , though limited activity disease . We hypothesize combine novel EGFR inhibitor erlotinib bevacizumab synergistic effect tumor . We select 15mg/kg q21 day bevacizumab base data publish Johnson DH et al , 99 patient randomly assign bevacizumab 7.5 ( n = 32 ) 15 mg/kg ( n = 35 ) plus carboplatin ( area curve = 6 ) paclitaxel ( 200 mg/m2 ) every 3 week carboplatin paclitaxel alone ( n = 32 ) . The high response note high-dose group ( 31.5 % ) 28.1 % low dose bevacizumab arm . There also trend improve TTP OS high dose arm , although study lack sufficient power make definitive conclusion regard possible relationship dose treatment effect . ( 105 ) The safety efficacy dose schedule confirm E4599 ( 43 ) . Herbst et al confirm safety combination erlotinib 150 mg/day orally plus bevacizumab 15 mg/kg publish phase I/II trial ( 74 ) This regimen potential provide new , effective therapy malignancy , well teach u important lesson biology disease . To end , would also measure surrogate marker angiogenesis , tumor VEGF expression , serum VCAM-1 bFGF , well urine VEGF . We would also determine tumor expression phosphorylated EGFR , analyze effect know variant polymorphism VEGF gene outcome . We test tumor sample expression EGFR IHC FISH correlate response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm invasive , recurrent metastatic thymoma thymic carcinoma amenable potentially curative therapy surgery opinion investigator . Original biopsy tumor sufficient diagnose unless otherwise clinically indicate . Patients must measurable disease per RECIST . Note : Any scan xrays use document measurable disease must obtain within 28 day prior registration . Patients must prior chemotherapy ( limit prior regimen ) metastatic disease . Patients must form systemic anticancer therapy within 21 day prior register protocol therapy . Patients receive radiation therapy must complete radiation least 21 day prior register protocol therapy , toxicity due radiation must recover ≤ grade 1 baseline prior registration . Previously radiate area ( ) must site disease . Be least 18 year age time consent . Patient 's must laboratory data specify within 14 day registration study : 1 . Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( unless liver metastasis present , case AST/ALT ≤ 5 time upper limit normal acceptable ) . 2 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dl . 3 . White blood cell ( WBC ) count &gt; 3000/mm3 4 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 5 . Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3 6. International normalized ration ( INR ) prothrombin time ≤ 1.2 , aPTT 5 second longer ULN 7 . Urine protein : creatinine ratio 1.0 screening . Patients must prior history malignancy past 5 year exception basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Other cancer low potential metastasis , situ cancer ( e.g. , Grade 1 , TA TCC ( low grade superficial bladder cancer ) , colonic polyp focus adenocarcinoma ) also enrol approval study chair . No prior use EGFR inhibitor antiangiogenic agent . No use investigational agent within 30 day prior registration study protocol . Must contraindication use erlotinib bevacizumab per package label either product . No uncontrolled hypertension ( e.g . &gt; 150/100 mmHg pretreatment ) No history unstable angina . No history New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure No history myocardial infarction angina pectoris/ anginal equivalent last 6 month ( patient may antianginal medication symptom entirely control great 6 month ) within 6 month prior registration protocol therapy . No history stroke within 6 month prior registration protocol therapy . No clinically significant peripheral vascular disease . No evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy . ( Low dose anticoagulant therapy maintain patency vascular access device allow ) . Patients must use aspirin ( &gt; 325 mg/day ) another nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medication know inhibit platelet function daily within 10 day prior registration.. Patients may take follow drug know inhibit platelet function : dipyridamole ( Persantine ) , ticlopidine ( Ticlid ) , clopidogrel ( Plavix ) cilostazol ( Pletal ) . No known evidence central nervous system involvement brain metastasis . If symptomatic must confirm Head CT Brain MRI within 6 week prior register protocol therapy . No major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior registration protocol therapy . No anticipation need major surgical procedure course study .
