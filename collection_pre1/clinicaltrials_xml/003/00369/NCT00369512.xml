	<brief_summary>This phase II study design study effectiveness combine radiotherapy erlotinib postoperative setting patient cutaneous SCC high risk recurrence . Participants enrol study evaluate head neck surgeon , radiation oncologist . Whenever possible , preoperative biopsy perform participant enrollment study histological confirmation molecular correlate . Participants enrol prior surgical resection begin erlotinib 150 mg daily ( 14 tablet ) take 14 day prior surgical resection . Following planned surgical resection , participant begin Erlotinib therapy radiotherapy time within 4-8 week surgical resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Erlotinib + Radiotherapy Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-institution , open-label , non-randomized phase II trial erlotinib administer concomitantly radiation therapy follow surgical resection gross disease . A total 45 patient previously unirradiated , high-risk cutaneous SCC require post-operative radiotherapy enrol assess primary endpoint time recurrence disease free survival . Pretreatment biopsy require confirm histological diagnosis SCC . Four six week surgical resection , patient begin erlotinib ( 150 mg po qd ) begin first day radiotherapy . Patients receive 5040 cGy begin day 1 therapy standard fractionation . Patients follow evaluate toxicity base NCI common toxicity criterion ( v3.0 ) . Patients follow protocol minimum 2 year regularly schedule CT scan , clinical evaluation , laboratory work . Patients residual recurrent cancer take protocol salvage therapy . As secondary objective , molecular response tumor erlotinib monotherapy determine . When possible , participant enrol treated 14 day erlotinib prior surgical resection . The pretreatment biopsy specimen ( control ) compare tissue acquire surgical resection 14 day erlotinib ( experimental group ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically proven primary recurrent squamous cell carcinoma arise lip skin face , ear , scalp neck . Participants must meet one four criterion : 1 . T4 cutaneous SCC determine physical exam , image study , prior resection biopsy . T4 disease define tumor invades deep extradermal structure cartilage , skeletal muscle ( e.g. , muscle facial expression ) , parotid gland bone.Patients T2 great squamous cell carcinoma low lip require post operative radiation allow . 2 . Histologically proven regional lymph node involvement ( N1 disease ) . Fine needle aspiration biopsy use demonstrate presence lymphatic spread . 3 . Histologically proven parotid gland metastasis . Fine needle aspiration biopsy use demonstrate presence regional spread . Includes delayed regional metastasis ; primary scalp skin lesion treat within 36 month would drain involved parotid . 4 . Patients follow surgical resection primary find histologically positive lymph node ( N1 ) . Includes delayed regional metastasis ; primary lip cutaneous lesion treat within 36 month would drain involved nodal basin . Age &gt; 19 year Tumors must consider surgically resectable . ( Patients may enrol surgery complete long Erlotinib therapy concurrent radiation start within 8 week surgical resection . ) Required laboratory data obtain prior begin treatment : WBC &gt; 1,500/ml ; Platelets &gt; 90,000 ; serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl The patient may prior noncutaneous malignancy , must two year treatment . Performance status ≤ 2 ( ECOG scale ) life expectancy ≥ 12 month . The patient must agree use effective contraception potential procreativity . Contraception must conduct least 3 month follow study . Patients must sign informed consent The patient receive prior radiation therapy head neck . The patient pregnant lactating Patients prior history head neck mucosal cancer . Psychological condition render patient unable understand inform consent .</criteria>
