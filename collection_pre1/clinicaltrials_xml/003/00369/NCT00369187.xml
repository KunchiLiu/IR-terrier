	<brief_summary>This Phase IV , dose escalation , within-patient control study pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , safety tolerability compare single dose administration large protein molecule without recombinant human hyaluronidase ( rHuPH20 ) single dose administration large molecule escalate dos rHuPH20 . The study hypothesize optimal dose rHuPH20 increase bioavailability large molecule drug administration .</brief_summary>
