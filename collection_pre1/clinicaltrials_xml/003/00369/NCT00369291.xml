	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Giving CpG 7909 autologous stem cell transplant may make strong immune response prevent delay recurrence cancer . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose CpG 7909 treat patient undergone autologous stem cell transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CpG 7909 Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether CpG 7909 enhance immune function , measure response keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( neo-antigen ) tetanus toxoid ( memory antigen ) , patient undergo autologous stem cell transplantation . Secondary - Determine dose escalation CpG 7909 , within range previously test safe dos CpG 7909 , impact upon primary immune readout . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , dose-escalation study CpG 7909 . Patients receive CpG 7909 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 7 , 14 . Patients receive keyhole limpet hemocyanin SC tetanus toxoid SC day 7 . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos Cp6 7909 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . A total 10 patient treated MTD . Blood collect baseline approximately day 40 immunological study , include immunoenzyme technique , antibody response assay , immunophenotyping . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must undergone autologous transplantation nonHodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) , Hodgkin 's disease , acute myelogenous leukemia ( AML ) , germ cell tumor , multiple myeloma . Patients must eligible consent participate study MT1999 06 Vaccination tetanus toxoid Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin ( KLH ) ass antigen specific immune response ( BBIND 10430 ) . Patients eligible receive CpG 7909 vaccine day 60 post transplant . No patient eligible protocol beyond day 74 post transplant . Therefore , patient start therapy protocol day 6074 post transplant allow patient schedule flexibility . Patients must engraftment independent transfusion support growth factor support . Patients must receive platelet redcell transfusion previous week . Patients must continuously growth factor least 1 week . Unsupported count must : platelet ≥ 50,000/ml Hgb ≥ 9 gm/ul Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/µL Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 500/µL Patients must current performance status 01 ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) 70100 % ( Karnofsky . Patients must afebrile , antibiotic therapeutic ( prophylactic ) , free evidence active infection . Patients must intravenous ( IV ) hyperalimentation IV fluid . Minimum laboratory value within 2 week entry : Creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dl CrCl ≥ 50 ml/min , Bilirubin , ALT ≤ 2 x normal Age &gt; 18 year Patients receive schedule receive plan radiation therapy , growth factor therapy , steroid therapy study period ineligible . Patients must complete planned posttransplant radiation therapy applicable . Patients must able give write informed consent agree comply study parameter Patients must agree use contraception study . Patients one following : Active infection , fever &gt; 38.2˚C Significant nonmalignant disease include document HIV infection , uncontrolled hypertension ( diastolic blood press &gt; 115 mmHg ) , unstable angina , congestive heart failure ( NY Class II ) , poorly control diabetes , coronary angioplasty within 6 month , myocardial infarction last 6 month , uncontrolled atrial ventricular cardiac arrhythmia . Hematopoietic growth factor administer within 1 week study entry . Expected require additional cytotoxic therapy within 30 day study Receiving posttransplant investigational agent Patients history autoimmune diseases ineligible protocol It unknown whether CpG 7909 may exacerbate autoimmune disorder immunomodulatory effect . Therefore , subject history autoimmune disease receive CpG 7909 . Controlled thyroid disease permissible . Systemic corticosteroid immunosuppressant Pregnant lactating ( It unlikely probably unwise woman childbearing potential become pregnant early transplant , however ; suspicion , pregnancy test do ) Not meet one eligibility criterion , list</criteria>
