	<brief_summary>Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow cancer . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving bortezomib together rituximab may kill cancer cell . This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together rituximab work first-line therapy treat patient low-grade B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
