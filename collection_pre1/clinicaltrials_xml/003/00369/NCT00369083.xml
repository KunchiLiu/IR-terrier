This study consider single-blind study patient aware treatment assignment physicians nurse evaluate patient blind patient ’ allocation . In ED patient underwent baseline standard clinical evaluation ; blood test ( blood cell count , routine biochemical test arterial blood gas tension ) ; pulse oximetry ; 12-lead electrocardiography ; chest radiograph hand-held spirometry ( SpirHOMEter , COSMED , Italy ) .
