	<brief_title>AFP464 Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose AFP464 patient advance solid tumor . II . Assess safety tolerability drug patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Observe clinical response patient treated drug . II . Characterize pharmacokinetics drug patient . III . Determine clinical significance genetic polymorphism gene cod metabolize enzyme ( e.g. , CYP1A1 , 1A2 , 2C9 , 2C19 , SULTA1 ) disposition efficacy/toxicity AFP464 AF . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive AFP464 IV 3 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Cohorts 2-6 patient receive escalate dos AFP464 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose ≤ 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . An additional 10 patient whose tumor amenable biopsy treat MTD . Patients undergo blood collection periodically pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study . Patients treat MTD also undergo tumor tissue biopsy periodically additional pharmacodynamic correlative biomarker study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
