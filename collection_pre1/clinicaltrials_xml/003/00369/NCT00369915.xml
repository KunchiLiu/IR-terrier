	<brief_title>The Antidepressant Efficacy Anticholinergic Scopolamine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite availability wide range antidepressant drug , clinical trial indicate 30 % 40 % patient major depression fail respond first-line antidepressant treatment , despite adequate dosage , duration , compliance . Moreover , patient experience symptomatic relief follow conventional anti-depressant treatment , clinical improvement evident 3-4 week . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic unipolar bipolar depression . The cholinergic system one neurotransmitter system implicate pathophysiology mood disorder . Evidence suggest major depressive episode , cholinergic system hypersensitive acetylcholine . Agents enhance muscarinic cholinergic receptor function increase depressive symptom depressed subject , produce symptom depression healthy individual . The preclinical literature specifically implicate muscarinic receptor indicate use muscarinic antagonist , context animal model depression , result improvement behavioral analog depression . Preliminary result obtain protocol 3-M-0108 provide strong evidence potential effectiveness anticholinergic scopolamine rapidly produce clinically significant antidepressant effect . We observe large reduction Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) score occurred hours/days follow i.v . infusion scopolamine , stand mark contrast 3-4 week period generally required conventional therapy . Moreover , improvement observe subject nonresponsive incompletely responsive conventional antidepressant therapy , highlight potential treatment benefit large percentage individual depression . The goal research project perform clinical trial evaluate efficacy muscarinic cholinergic receptor antagonist scopolamine administer via transdermal patch clinical symptom depression .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Two group subject recruit study protocol : unipolar depressive bipolar depressive . Subjects unipolar bipolar depression appear exhibit abnormal cholinergic function depress phase , difference hypothesize exist MDD BD depressives herein . However , BD subject difficult recruit , evidence cholinergic abnormality particularly compel BD . Moreover , observation pilot study suggest scopolamine improve symptom MDD BD , particularly persuasive observation give BD notoriously difficult treat . Thus , magnitude serious clinical problem justifies inclusion BD subject . Therefore group recruit . However , BD Type I subject include currently stable lithium valproate reduce risk associate possible precipitation mania . The presence inclusion exclusion criterion establish use unstructured clinical interview psychiatrist Structured Clinical Interview DSMIV ( SCID ) . Family history mental illness obtain subject use Family Interview Genetic Studies . We recruit 24 subject per group . DEPRESSED SAMPLES : Subjects ( age 1855 ) currently suffer major depressive episode fall one follow subgroup : 1. . MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER ( MDD ) : Subjects select primary MDD currently depress define DSMIV criterion recurrent MDD current MADRS score moderatelytoseverely depressed range ( great equal 20 ) . The duration index episode great equal four week . 2. . BIPOLAR DISORDER TYPE II ( BD ) : Subjects select meet DSMIV criterion bipolar disorder Type I II currently depress , MADRS score moderatelytoseverely depressed range ( great equal 20 ) . The duration index episode great equal four week . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects recruit drugnaive receive psychotropic drug least 3 week ( 8 week fluoxetine ) prior screen . Subjects also exclude : ) serious suicidal ideation behavior , current delusion hallucination , b ) inability provide inform consent , c ) serious , unstable illness include hepatic , renal , gastroenterologic , respiratory , cardiovascular ( include ischemic heart disease , endocrinologic , neurologic , immunologic , hematologic disease , ) history drug alcohol abuse within 6 month alcohol drug dependence last five year ( DSM IV criterion ) , e ) use medically accept mean contraception woman childbearing potential , f ) current pregnancy ( documented pregnancy test prior brain scan avoid expose fetus radiation research MRI scan medically necessary ) , g ) current breast feeding , h ) history ulcerative colitis toxic megacolon , ) vision and/or hear problem severe enough interfere test , j ) electrocardiographic evidence ischemia , arrhythmia , conduction defect , myocardial infarction , k ) current blood pressure great 160 mm Hg le 90 mm Hg systolic , great 90 mm Hg diastolic , l ) clinically significant cerebrovascular cardiovascular disease , hypertension , congestive heart disease , angina pectoris , clinic evidence cerebrovascular disease , gross neurological impairment , hyperthyroidism , know hypersensitivity idiosyncracy anticholinergic agent ( e.g . skin rash ) , glaucoma , renal hepatic impairment , ) current nicotine use nicotine dependence within last six month ( due effect nicotine cholinergic system ) n ) narrow angle glaucoma ( due possibility exacerbation condition scopolamine ) ) age great 55 year ( reduce biological heterogeneity encompass MDD BD criterion , since subject late ageat onset depression far great likelihood MRI correlate cerebrovascular disease agematched , healthy control agematched , earlyonset depressive ) , p ) exposure within two week medication likely affect mood cognition likely interact scopolamine ( e.g . narcotic anticholinergic agent ) verify history urine drug screen , q ) HIV positive status , r ) history gastric intestinal obstruction , ) history urinary retention bladder obstruction . During course study , participant unable take medication , include antidepressant antianxiety agent , sleep aid , diphenhydramine ( e.g . Benedryl ) cough/cold preparation contain diphenhydramine antihistamine . A detailed list allow allowed medication provide Appendix B protocol . We exclude comorbid anxiety disorder . Exclusion patient comorbid anxiety disorder would affect generalizability finding since substantial percentage patient major depression comorbid diagnosis . Instead , exclude patient comorbid diagnosis believe clinical significance . Allowing participation patient history comorbid anxiety disorder broaden inclusion criterion closely approximate patient see real world setting .</criteria>
