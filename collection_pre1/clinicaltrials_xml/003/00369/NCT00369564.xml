	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Glutamic acid may help lessen prevent nerve damage cause vincristine . It yet know whether glutamic acid effective placebo prevent nerve damage patient receive vincristine Wilms ' tumor , rhabdomyosarcoma , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study glutamic acid see well work compare placebo reduce nerve damage cause vincristine young patient receive vincristine Wilms ' tumor , rhabdomyosarcoma , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Glutamic Acid Reducing Nerve Damage Caused Vincristine Young Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare effect glutamic acid v placebo , term decrease neurotoxicity measure score neurologic examination , young patient undergoing vincristine-containing treatment Wilms ' tumor , rhabdomyosarcoma , acute lymphoblastic leukemia , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma . Secondary - Compare frequency type neurotoxicity observe patient treated glutamic acid versus placebo . - Determine great proportion patient receive glutamic acid able receive 100 % schedule dos vincristine versus treat glutamic acid . OUTLINE : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease duration plan vincristine-containing treatment ( Wilms ' tumor rhabdomyosarcoma treatment plan ≥ 9 consecutive week [ stratum 1 ] v acute lymphoblastic leukemia non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treatment plan ≥ 4 consecutive week [ stratum 2 ] ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral glutamic acid 3 time daily begin prior first dose vincristine continue week 5 ( stratum 2 ) total 4 dos vincristine week 10 ( stratum 1 ) total 9 dos vincristine . - Arm II : Patients receive oral placebo 3 time daily begin prior first dose vincristine continue week 5 ( stratum 2 ) total 4 dos vincristine week 10 ( stratum 1 ) total 9 dos vincristine . All patient undergo neurologic examination baseline 5 week . Patients stratum 1 also undergo additional neurologic examination week 10 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 250 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients ≥ 3 &lt; 21 year age time study registration . Patients newly diagnose Wilm 's tumor schedule receive least 9 consecutive week chemotherapy vincristinecontaining regimen . Patients newly diagnose rhabdomyosarcoma schedule receive least 9 consecutive week chemotherapy vincristinecontaining regimen . Patients newly diagnose ALL schedule receive 4 consecutive week chemotherapy vincristinecontaining regimen accompany steroid therapy . Patients newly diagnose Non Hodgkins Lymphoma ( NHL ) schedule receive 4 consecutive week chemotherapy vincristinecontaining regimen accompany steroid therapy . Patients underlie neuromuscular disease peripheral neuropathy EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Abnormal baseline peripheral neurologic exam ( i.e . peripheral neuropathy ) Patients : seizure disorder primary intracranial malignancy family history Charcot Marie Tooth Disease recent history GuillianBarré26 Patients receive concomitant itraconazole risk increase vincristine toxicity therefore ineligible . Patients regularly use laxative stool softener constipation time enrollment eligible participate study . Likewise , since prevention neuroconstipation evaluate , patient ongoing history constipation require frequent use laxatives stool softener enrol . Patients schedule receive laxative stool softener prophylactically prevent constipation , prevention neuroconstipation evaluate study ; however , patient show sign develop constipation chemotherapy , determine treat physician , may treat laxative stool softener clinician 's discretion . Use laxatives stool softener document concomitant medication log .</criteria>
