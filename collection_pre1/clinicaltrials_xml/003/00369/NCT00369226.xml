	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Velcade ( also know bortezomib ) help prevent graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) develop transplantation . This do use combination three immune suppressive medication : Velcade , tacrolimus methotrexate . Stem cell transplantation one option patient cancer blood blood forming organ . Recently , allogeneic stem cell transplant perform use low dos chemotherapy radiotherapy : non-myeloablative `` mini '' transplant . GVHD significant problem may occur even `` mini '' transplantation . Information research study , suggest Velcade may help reduce risk develop GVHD give early transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Plus Tacrolimus Methotrexate Prevent Graft Versus Host Disease ( GVHD ) After Mismatched Allogeneic Non-Myeloablative Blood Stem Cell Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- In study look high dose Velcade give people safely give tacrolimus methotrexate . Not everyone participates study receive amount study drug . The dose participant receive depend upon number subject enrol study well tolerated dos drug . - Before Transplant : In addition chemotherapy drug , fludarabine busulfex , participant non-myeloablative transplant , also start take tacrolimus orally three day transplant . - After Transplant Medication : Methotrexate ; Intravenously day 1 , 3 , 6 &amp; 11 transplant total 4 dos . Tacrolimus ; Continue take orally daily . Velcade : Intravenously day 1 , 4 &amp; 7 transplant , total 3 dos . Filgrastim : Subcutaneous injection daily start day transplant continue participant blood count recover . - After Transplant Physical Exams &amp; Tests : Participants physical exam blood test every week 1 month . After 1 month , none marrow biopsy perform look evidence donor 's cell participant bone marrow . - Following 1 month period time , participant see every week . Another bone marrow biopsy , well blood test , take 3-4 month transplant review disease status . At point , participant come clinic every 3 month , determine physician one year . - While study end 12 month transplant , would like keep track participant medical condition rest life .</detailed_description>
