	<brief_title>Functional Brain Imaging Medication Treatment Response Mild Alzheimer 's Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study seek differentiate task-related rest brain activity pattern capture via functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) associate two common Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) medication , equivalent acetylcholinesterase inhibition effect ( AChEI ) differ respect allosteric nicotinic receptor modulation effect . It primary aim project gain well understand brain mechanism involve attentional executive skill improvement associate nicotinic receptor modulation mild AD patient . To address question , 12-week continuous treatment , double-blind , head-to-head dose-escalation treatment trial seek visualize treatment response unique allosteric nicotinic receptor modulation associate fMRI data standard cognitive assessment outcome . Using in-scanner task show reliably elicit brain activity cortical region important memory attention , treatment trial examine rest task-related BOLD signal characteristic well-characterized sample 36 mild AD patient period low dose high dose AD dementia treatment either galantamine hydrobromide ( AChEI + nicotinic receptor modulation ) donepezil hydrochloride ( AChEI ) . Both low high dose image comparison treatment group equivalent 35 % AChEI-effect , may allow isolation BOLD signal unique allosteric nicotinic receptor modulation brain rest task-related brain state .</detailed_description>
