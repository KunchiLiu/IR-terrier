	<detailed_description>Although direct pharmacological effect antidepressant manifest rapidly , significant symptom relief appear , typically antidepressant treatment need continue 2 4 week . This delayed onset clinical effect indicate involvement adaptive change antidepressant effect . Rodent study consistently show upregulation 3 , 5-cyclic adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) system induced different type chronic acute antidepressant treatment include serotonin norepinephrine uptake inhibitor , monoamine oxidase inhibitor , tricyclic antidepressant , lithium electroconvulsions . cAMP synthesize adenosine 5-triphosphate ( ATP ) adenylyl cyclase metabolize cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) . Type 4 PDE ( PDE4 ) selective cAMP brain . Among component cAMP pathway , PDE4 appear critical antidepressant effect inhibitor PDE4 , 4- [ 3- ( cyclopenotoxyl ) -4-methoxyphenyl ] -2-pyrrolidone ( rolipram ) , show antidepressant effect animal human , various form antidepressant treatment induced increase PDE4 rodent . However , without image cAMP pathway antidepressant treatment depressive , possible study adaptive change signal transduction system role symptom relief . Recently ( R ) - [ ( 11 ) C ] rolipram successfully use image PDE4 animal human . We confirm PDE4 level measure reliably perform ( R ) - [ ( 11 ) C ] rolipram positron emission tomography ( PET ) multiple arterial sample even rat . The primary purpose protocol compare PDE4 level start selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) sertraline , citalopram escitalopram unmedicated depressed patient . The secondary purpose compare PDE4 level unmedicated depressed patient healthy subject . Baseline scan patient used second comparison . For first time , comparison become possible new PET agent ( R ) - [ ( 11 ) C ] rolipram . The finding advance understanding role cAMP signal transduction system pathology depression mechanisms antidepressant effect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Volunteers ( n = 70 ) Healthy Control Sample ( n = 70 ) : Sixty volunteer brain PET scan 10 blood sample compare ( R ) [ ( 11 ) C ] rolipram level artery vein . Healthy subject ( age 1855 ) select meet criterion major psychiatric disorder , know firstdegree relative mood disorder , current score Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ; 17 item ) ( Williams 1988 ) depress range ( less equal 7 ) . Control subject match depressed subject age gender . Forty subject ( R ) [ ( 11 ) C ] rolipram PET scan blood sample 10 subject blood sample without PET scan . The healthy volunteer use measure difference ( R ) [ ( 11 ) C ] rolipram concentration artery vein undergo psychiatric assessment data compare patient . MDD Samples ( n = 65 ) MDD SampleCurrently Depressed ( n = 65 ) : Patients ( age 1855 ) select primary MDD currently depress DSMIV criterion recurrent MDD current 17item HDRS score great equal 18 MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) ( Noble et al 1991 ) great equal 20 indicate moderatelytoseverely depress symptom . All subject must physically healthy age 18 55 year . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects recruit drugna ( SqrRoot ) receive psychotropic drug least 2 week ( 6 week fluoxetine ) prior scan . Effective medication discontinue purpose study . Subjects also exclude : 1. serious suicidal ideation behavior 2. psychosis 3. medical condition concomitant medication likely influence PET measurement significant interaction sertraline , citalopram escitalopram . 4. history drug alcohol abuse within 1 year lifetime history alcohol drug dependence ( DSMIV criterion ) 5. positive urine drug screen 6. current pregnancy ( documented pregnancy test prior scan ) 7. general MRI exclusion criterion 8. major depression arise follow another major medical psychiatric condition , 9. prior participation research protocol within year radiation exposure would exceed annual guideline For patient two [ C11 ] rolipram PET scan , one another SSRI treatment , previous failure intolerance SSRI may allow treatment current protocol . In clinical practice , medication switch sertraline citalopram/escitalopram sertraline citalopram/escitalopram somewhat different therapeutic effect adverse reaction . Along line , consider citalopram enantiomer escitalopram equivalent . Patients therefore exclude study two [ C11 ] rolipram PET scan previously fail respond adequate treatment trial medication available use study , history unable tolerate study medication . Specifically , patient exclude study two [ C11 ] rolipram PET scan : j ) previously prove unresponsive therapeutic trial sertraline citalopram/escitalopram . k ) previously develop allergic reaction sertraline citalopram/escitalopram , discontinue sertraline citalopram/escitalopram due adverse effect l ) combination therapeutic unresponsiveness adverse medication effect , unsuitable treatment sertraline citalopram/escitalopram ) prolong QTc ECG Please note exclusion criterion j , k , l apply patient one [ C11 ] rolipram PET without antidepressant treatment protocol . Additional exclusion criterion apply control subject : n ) subject current past history axis I psychiatric condition ) subject firstdegree family member current past history mood disorder . Please note exclusion criterion ( exception f ) apply healthy volunteer use measure difference ( R ) [ ( 11 ) C ] rolipram concentration artery vein , without PET scan . Subjects beyond age 55 exclude reduce biological heterogeneity encompass MDD criterion , reduce variability PET data .</criteria>
