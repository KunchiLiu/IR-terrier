	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Tapentadol ( CG5503 ) Treatment Acute Pain From Bunionectomy Compared With Placebo Followed Voluntary Open Label Extension Safety .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo bunionectomy often experience moderate severe acute pain post-surgery . Normally pain controlled patient receive repeat dos opioid analgesic . However , opioid therapy commonly associate side effect nausea , vomit , sedation , constipation , addiction , tolerance , respiratory depression . CG5503 , newly synthesize drug also act centrally acting analgesic dual mode action . The aim study investigate effectiveness ( level pain control ) safety ( side effect ) 3 dose level CG5503 Immediate Release ( IR ) compare drug ( placebo ) one dose level oxycodone ( opioid commonly use treat post-surgical pain ) . This study randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , double-blind ( neither investigator patient know treatment receive ) , active- placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study evaluate treatment acute pain bunionectomy . The study include blind 72 hour inpatient phase immediately follow bunionectomy , patient treat either 50- , 75- , 100-mg CG5503 IR base , placebo , 15-mg oxycodone IR , pain intensity pain relief periodically assess . Following phase , patient wish continue treatment CG5503 IR may enter outpatient voluntary nonrandomized , open-label extension phase 9 day receive 50- 100-mg CG5503 IR . Assessments pain relief include pain intensity numeric rating scale ( PI ) , pain relief numeric rating scale ( PAR ) , patient global impression change scale ( PGIC ) . Safety evaluation include monitor adverse event , physical examination , clinical laboratory test . Venous blood sample collect determination serum concentration CG5503 oxycodone . The null hypothesis study efficacy result CG5503 IR dosage group equal placebo base mean sum pain intensity difference 48 hour . The alternative study hypothesis least 1 dose strength CG5503 different placebo control pain 48 hour . CG5503 IR 50 , 75 , 100 mg ( base ) , oxycodone 15 mg , placebo : 1 capsule take every 4 6 hour 72-hour postsurgery phase study ; CG5503 , 50 mg capsule , 1 2 tablet take mouth every 4 6 hour 9 day open label portion study . All dos study treatment take approximately 120 mL water without food .</detailed_description>
