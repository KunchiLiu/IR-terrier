	<brief_summary>Patients undergo stenting procedure , cardiac non-cardiac surgery could develop myocardial damage testify cardiac troponin release . Sevoflurane ( volatile anesthetic ) , routinely used cardiac non-cardiac anesthesia , cardioprotective property could useful reduce cardiac damage , indicate cardiac troponin release different context : - stenting procedure ( periprocedural administration ) - non-cardiac surgery ( whole procedure ) - cardiac surgery ( whole procedure )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Volatile Anesthetics Cardiac Protection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stenting procedure , cardiac non-cardiac surgical procedure may carry significant risk cardiac damage ultimately lead prolonged hospital stay even non-negligible periprocedural mortality rate . According American College Cardiology/American Heart Association Guidelines anesthetic technique drug know cardiac effect consider perioperative plan . There appear one best myocardium protective anesthetic technique : choice anesthesia best leave discretion anesthesia care team . To date anesthesiological drug technique prove reduce perioperative morbidity mortality cardiac surgery , Beta-blockers locoregional analgesia show improved outcomes non-cardiac surgery study anesthesiological drug perform stenting procedure . Volatile anesthetic , commonly use general anesthesia induce maintain hypnosis , analgesia , amnesia mild muscle relaxation , show improve post-ischemic recovery cellular level , isolate heart , animal , pharmacological precondition postconditioning action . Whether cardioprotective effect volatile anesthetic clinically applicable associate improved cardiac function , ultimately result well outcome patient undergoing cardiac surgery , still debate . No data exist patient undergo non-cardiac surgery stenting procedure . A recently publish meta-analysis include study consider volatile anesthetic show reduction myocardial infarction perioperative death rate . However new volatile anesthetic ( desflurane sevoflurane ) seem prominent cardioprotective property numerous apparently positive report target surrogate end-points , yet severely underpowered , appeared literature . Of interest , many study include cite meta-analysis . To address question whether choice anesthetic regimen might influence patient ' outcome plan RCT determine impact sevoflurane perioperative cardiac damage patient undergoing cardiac surgery , non-cardiac surgery stenting procedure .</detailed_description>
