	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Tapentadol ( CG5503 ) Treatment Acute Pain After Hip Replacement Surgery Compared With Oxycodone Placebo Followed Voluntary Open-Label Extension For Safety</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo hip replacement often experience moderate severe acute pain post-surgery . Normally pain controlled patient receive repeat dos opioid analgesic . However , opioid therapy commonly associate side effect nausea , vomit , sedation , constipation , addiction , tolerance , respiratory depression . CG5503 , newly synthesize drug also act centrally act pain reliever dual mode action . The aim study investigate effectiveness ( level pain control ) safety ( side effect ) 3 dose level CG5503 , immediate release , ( IR ) formulation , compare drug ( placebo ) one dose level oxycodone ( opioid commonly use treat post-surgical pain ) . This study randomize , double-blind ( neither investigator patient know treatment receive ) , active- placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study evaluate treatment acute pain hip replacement surgery . The study include blind 72 hour in-patient phase immediately follow hip replacement surgery , patient treat either 50- , 75- , 100-mg CG5503 base IR , placebo , 10-mg oxycodone , pain relief periodically assess . Following phase , patient wish continue treatment CG5503 IR may enter outpatient voluntary nonrandomized , open-label extension phase 9 day receive 50- 100-mg CG5503 IR . Assessments pain relief include pain intensity numeric rating scale ( PI ) , pain relief numeric rating scale ( PAR ) patient global impression change scale ( PGIC ) . Safety evaluation include monitor adverse event , physical examination , clinical laboratory test . Venous blood sample collect determination serum concentration CG5503 oxycodone . The null hypothesis study efficacy result CG5503 IR dosage group equal placebo base mean sum pain intensity difference 48 hour . The alternative study hypothesis least 1 dose strength CG5503 different placebo control pain 48 hour . CG5503 base IR 50 , 75 , 100 mg , oxycodone 10 mg , placebo , 1 capsule take mouth every 4 6 hour 72 hour postsurgery phase study ( one extra dose allow , need pain ) ; CG5503 , 50 mg base capsule , 1 2 tablet take mouth every 4 6 hour 9 day open label portion study . All dos study treatment take approximately 120 mL water food .</detailed_description>
