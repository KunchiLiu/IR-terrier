	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate BeneFIX infuse prophylaxis regimen , compare BeneFIX administer on-demand regimen . In trial , subject participate 4 study period . The first period 16-week on-demand treatment , subject utilize BeneFIX treat bleed event episodically occur ( i.e. , on-demand treatment ) . At end period , subject randomly assign 1 2 BeneFIX prophylaxis regimen : either 100 IU/kg weekly 50 IU/kg twice weekly , follow 16 week . At end period , subject use on-demand treatment 8 week . The purpose 8-week period mitigate potential carry-over effect prior prophylaxis regimen bleed frequency . Following 8-week on-demand treatment , subject cross-over receive alternate study prophylactic regimen 16 week . The primary endpoint annualized number bleed episode , compare first on-demand period prophylaxis regimen . A comparison annualized bleed episode two prophylaxis regimen also perform . Subject-reported outcome also collect use patient diary . At 24 48 hour follow onset joint bleed episode , information pain , sleep , work collect . Additional data physical functioning record diary end 16-week on-demand period , end prophylaxis period . Information safety also collect . Each subject participate study approximately 59 week ( 15 month ) , include screen period 3 week , initial 16-week on-demand period , two prophylaxis treatment period 16 week , separate 8-week on-demand treatment period . A modified FIX recovery study perform prophylaxis period . The study diary also use subject collect secondary endpoint . These endpoint , subject-reported outcome , record diary 24 48 hour follow onset joint bleed episode . Additional data physical functioning record diary end 16-week on-demand period , end prophylaxis period . Patients recruit United States , Canada , Europe Russia .</brief_summary>
