	<detailed_description>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) refer medical condition occur age men prostate gland enlarge prevent free flow urine . This cause symptoms frequent urination , constant feeling urgency go bathroom , difficulty pass urine due obstruction cause enlarged gland . The incidence ( number new case ) BPH increase 40 % among male age 50 60 year 90 % among male old 80 year age . Treatment BPH currently undergo intense scrutiny due cost morbidity ( complication disability due procedure ) associate `` gold standard '' treatment , Transurethral Resection Prostate ( TURP ) . The TURP procedure establish place standard care BPH due exceptional clinical efficacy establish long-term durability . Despite clinical prowess TURP , remain significant concern regard relatively high incidence postoperative morbidity significant economic burden world healthcare system . Laser vaporization prostatectomy , hand , develop relatively new technological advance utilize favorable outcome decade .</detailed_description>
