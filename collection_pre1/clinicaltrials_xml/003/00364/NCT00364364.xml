	<brief_title>Safety Study Determine Appropriate Dose Antibody Against Tumor Cells Best Target Patients With Pancreatic Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-center , non-randomized , single-arm , pilot imaging study determine pharmacokinetics , biodistribution , tumor target indium-111 ( 111In ) -labeled , humanize anti-MUC1 antibody , designate hPAM4 IgG1 patient know pancreatic cancer . The primary objective trial examine change protein dose affect parameter intent determine single protein dose select optimize tumor target . It expect data aid selection appropriate protein dose use Phase I therapy trial yttrium-90 ( 90Y ) -labeled hPAM4 IgG . The secondary objective monitor safety . Pharmacokinetics , biodistribution , tumor targeting , dosimetry ( model 90Y ) assess clinical parameter , pre-study PAM4-reactive MUC-1 antigen serum , tumor size , location , histopathology , immunohistology , possible , antigen content extraction tumor sample .</detailed_description>
