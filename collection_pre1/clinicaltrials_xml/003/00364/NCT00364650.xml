	<brief_title>Probiotic Prophylaxis Immunosuppressant Associated Diarrhea ( IAD ) Following Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunosuppression follow organ transplantation associate myriad gastrointestinal complication include severe diarrhea . Mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) immunosuppressant often associate plague symptom . A retrospective study patient 10 US transplant center receive MMF immunosuppression kidney transplantation show nearly 50 % patient suffer least one gastrointestinal symptom within first 6 month transplantation . ( Tierce 2005 ) The majority patient diarrhea . However , Immunosuppression Associated Diarrhea ( IAD ) often observe association immunosuppressive agent well . It investigator 's observation IAD equally problematic whether immunosuppressive regimen include MMF . When IAD severe difficult recipient maintain adequate level immunosuppression . Not infrequently , IAD distress recipient 's immunosuppressive medication taper , change stop . During time drug manipulation , patient risk early acute rejection . Approximately 30 % renal transplant patient MMF regimen adjust discontinue suffer episode acute rejection . Reversing rejection episode expensive add significant risk recipient long-term allograft survival . Thus , strategy support maintain normal healthy bowel function moderate obviate IAD highly desirable . Repopulation normal intestinal microflora kidney transplant patient kidney transplantation may maintain normal bowel function . This study design test hypothesis administration food supplement probiotic consist high amount six strain lactic acid bacteria normally find human colon favorably support maintain bowel function moderate obviate IAD .</detailed_description>
