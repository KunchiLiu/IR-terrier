	<brief_summary>We plan conduct prospective study : 1. evaluate accuracy PET stag patient potentially operable non-small cell lung cancer ; 2. evaluate percentage futile thoracotomy PET introduce routine staging modality NSCLC patient ; 3. establish decision tree model base choice conventional imaging additional PET image analyze cost-effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Utility Cost-Effectiveness Analysis 18F-FDG PETin Staging Potential Operable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer major health issue worldwide , include Taiwan . According data publish Department Health , Executive Yuan , Taiwan , 2004 , lung cancer already leading cause cancer-related death Taiwan . Non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) represent approximately 75-85 % primary lung tumor . The strong prognostic factor survival whether tumor completely resect . Surgical resection may perform patient without distant extend lymph node metastasis . Because significant morbidity mortality surgical procedure lung cancer , therefore important identify exclude patient â€™ benefit surgical treatment . Conventional staging , use chest/brain X-ray compute tomography , abdominal echography radionuclide bone scintigraphy , lead futile thoracotomy 50 % patient . Since early 1990s , 18F-FDG PET emerge promising diagnostic image tool nuclear medicine , large number study report without exception PET well stag tool CT patient NSCLC . However , due prohibitive cost , PET routinely use stag NSCLC Taiwan . The extra cost accrue introduction new technology major concern clinical physician health policy maker . A number economic evaluation study overseas show PET cost-effective NSCLC add conventional work-up . However , due sensitivity specificity 18F-FDG PET stag NSCLC , cost structure medical expense , severity disease NSCLC patient first present hospital , may different different country . To best knowledge , report provide practical guide introduce PET stag NSCLC . A cost-effectiveness economic evaluation Taiwan thus demand . Patient eligibility : Inclusion criterion : Patients early NSCLC ( stage I &amp; II ) Exclusion criterion : ( 1 ) patient pregnant ( 2 ) patient 18 year old ( 3 ) patient refuse surgical intervention ( 4 ) patient know malignancy</detailed_description>
