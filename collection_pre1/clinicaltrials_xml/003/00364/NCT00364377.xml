	<brief_summary>People high fast glucose develop type 2 diabetes passage time . This study do determine effect novel medication people elevate fast glucose . Sitagliptin substance raise level hormone normally find blood . This hormone , call glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) , normally release intestine response presence food . This hormone act like messenger intestine pancreas raise insulin level , therefore , low blood sugar . Sitagliptin effective people diabetes , however , study do determine Sitagliptin effective people high fast glucose yet diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Impaired fast glucose ( IFG ) confers high risk progression diabetes . Its pathogenesis area active investigation , defect insulin glucagon secretion well insulin action likely play role . Several study suggest prediabetic diabetic state associate alteration circulate incretin concentration . More recently , large study non-diabetic individual demonstrate decreased GLP-1 concentration glucose challenge individual prediabetes conclude defect GLP-1 secretion unrelated insulin secretion . In impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , defect incretin-induced insulin secretion coexist defect glucose induced insulin secretion . Worsening degree glucose tolerance associate decreased insulin secretion prevail insulin action . Moreover early glucagon suppression impair IGT . Since GLP-1 insulin secretagogue suppresses glucagon , conceivable defect GLP-1 secretion could contribute pathogenesis pre-diabetes . Inhibition Dipeptidyl Peptidase-4 ( DPP-4 ) , enzyme rapidly degrade incretin hormone , show useful therapeutic strategy type 2 diabetes . DPP-4 inhibitor increase ( model-calculated ) insulin secretion decrease glucagon concentration result lower fasting ( postprandial ) glucose concentration people type 2 diabetes . Their effect people IFG less certain . However , DPP-4 inhibitor provide opportunity directly examine contribution abnormal incretin concentration pathogenesis IFG , raise concentration endogenous incretin hormone . The current experiment test hypothesis measure insulin secretion action fast postprandial glucose turnover 8 week therapy DPP-4 inhibitor .</detailed_description>
