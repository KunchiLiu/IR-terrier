	<detailed_description>Cancer second lead cause death among individual United States America ( Ries et al. , 2000 ) . Gastro-intestinal ( GI ) cancer account approximately 253,500 new case year men woman . Most patient GI cancer poor outcome ( American Cancer Society. , 2005 ; Ilson , 2001 ) , account approximately 16 % cancer relate death woman 25 % cancer relate death men ( American Cancer Society , 2005 ) . Of cancer , lung cancer lead cause death among men woman ( American Cancer Society. , 2005 ) . GI cancer constitute disease intensive medical research focus improvement prevention , early detection treatment . How patient GI cancer deal diagnosis remain understudied date . Lung cancer research focus particularly smoke impact lung cancer epidemiology . Lung cancer patient ' cop strategy study . Issues relate mean life , health self-care , physical functioning , cop support highlight important lung cancer patient ' deal disease situation ( Maliski , Sarna , Evangelista , &amp; Padilla , 2003 ; Sharf , Stelljes , &amp; Gordon , 2005 ) . Similarly , patient ' deal diagnosis breast cancer investigate ( Andritsch et al. , 2004 ; Badger , Braden , Mishel , &amp; Longman , 2004 ; Northouse , Templin , Mood , &amp; Oberst , 1998 ) . Constructs uncertainty locus control highly important cop disease situation . Uncertainty link quality life ( Sammarco , 2001 ; 2003 ) . Evidence also exist transitoriness , confrontation finitude human life , play important role individual cope ( Cohen et al. , 2004 ; Shaha &amp; Cox , 2003 ) . The interrelationship among transitoriness , uncertainty locus control yet delineate . There also need explore transitoriness fully mainly subsume concept 'finding mean illness ' 'anxiety ' ( Houldin , 2003 ) . Transitoriness link patient outcome quality life ( Houldin , 2003 ) . It necessary explore concept transitoriness establish link uncertainty locus control . It equally important explore association three concept together patient ' psycho-social well-being quality life . By explore association , individual 's way cop cancer diagnosis well understood lead development nursing intervention support person cancer , especially lung GI cancer . It possible ) explore concept transitoriness describe interrelationship uncertainty locus control , b ) investigate association among transitoriness , uncertainty , locus control , psycho-social well-being quality life . The following research question address study : 1 . Is cancer patient ' confrontation life 's finitude related uncertainty locus control ? 2 . Are cancer patient ' confrontation life 's finitude , uncertainty locus control associate psychosocial well-being quality life ? 3 .
