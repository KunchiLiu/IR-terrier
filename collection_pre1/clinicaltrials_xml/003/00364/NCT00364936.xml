This methodology follow Medical Research Council ( MRC ) framework development evaluation complex service treatment . The investigator interview people carers fast track standard practice group , follow time . This phase trial enable u calculate sample size test proof concept full randomise trial .

The investigator model new palliative care neurology service patient affect Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) conduct qualitative interview patient , family staff , plus literature review model pilot service . Then investigator start offer service design delay intervention randomise control trial test effectiveness part phase II MRC framework . Inclusion criterion trial patient identify refer clinician unresolved symptom psychological concern . A disability score great 8 Expanded Disability Scale identify benchmark . Consenting patient newly refer new service randomise either receive palliative care service immediately ( fast-track ) 12-week wait ( standard best practice ) . Face face interview conduct baseline ( intervention ) , 4-6 , 10-12 ( intervention standard-practice group ) , 16-18 22-24 week patient carers use standard questionnaire ass symptom , palliative care outcome , function , service use open comment . The investigator choice outcome base systematic literature review outcome measure .</detailed_description>
