	<brief_title>Impact Erythropoietin Treatment Versus Placebo Quality-of-life Patients With Advanced Prostate Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia common problem experience patient malignancy . Although cancer treatment systemic chemotherapy obvious cause , many cancer patient anemic presentation . Estimates prostate cancer patient suggest nearly 40 % present hemoglobin level less 120 g/L . The common clinical manifestation anemia fatigue , although vertigo , loss appetite , poor concentration dyspnea ( shortness breath ) also occur . Anemia often lead impairment physical capacity , lower patient ' subjective sense well-being , diminish overall quality-of-life ( QoL ) . The use recombinant erythropoietin patient chronic anemia end stage renal disease , acquire immune deficiency syndrome , anemia chronic disease set malignancy ( cancer ) well establish provide benefit reduce transfusion requirement . There exist number publish data QoL cancer patient . Abels et al . publish 1991 initial result clinical report specifically report QoL outcome . The study actually consist series three concurrent randomize , double blind , placebo control trial conduct group patient variety underlying malignancy . The three study include 124 patient previously treat systemic therapy , 132 patient treat systemically cisplatinum contain chemotherapy regimens 157 patient treat non-cisplatinum containing regimen respectively . All patient pre-treatment hemoglobin less 105 g/L hematocrit ( percentage red blood cell blood ) less 32 % . In trial , patient randomize receive recombinant erythropoietin significantly great increase hematocrit placebo patient . QoL parameter ( measure visual analog scale ) significantly improve patient receive erythropoietin demonstrate increase hematocrit throughout three study . Overall QoL improve significantly baseline , although individual study demonstrate trend towards improvement . Littlewood et al . publish 2001 result double-blind , placebo control multi-center study 375 cancer patient receive non-platinum containing chemotherapy . A baseline hemoglobin less equal 105 g/L , drop 20 g/L chemotherapy require eligibility . Patients randomize 1:2 either placebo epoetin alfa , 4 week follow chemotherapy . Active treatment demonstrate significant effectiveness increase hemoglobin level reduce transfusion requirement . Significant improvement primary cancer- anemia-specific QoL domain favour epoetin alfa . Although clinical evidence suggest benefit beyond reduce transfusion requirement , many study look impact QoL uncontrolled design , variable quality collection QoL data . Since also involve patient myriad primary malignancy , previous therapy , translation result site situation specific clinical practice difficult . As erythropoiesis complex process depend inhibit stimulate cytokine , may regulate differently among various neoplastic disease ( i.e . different tumour type ) , study homogenous group patient deem necessary evaluate impact QoL . Prostate cancer common serious cancer men . Despite advance screen treatment , progression incurable metastatic phase disease remain common . Androgen ablation therapy use surgery drug remain standard treatment , inevitably , androgen resistance develops . Hormone refractory prostate cancer represent spectrum disease range asymptomatic patient biochemical evidence androgen resistance end-stage disease characterize extensive bone metastasis , pain , wasting , reduce QoL , median survival less one year . Treatment hormone refractory prostate cancer prolong survival , may improve symptom QoL . Anemia common group patient , hemoglobin level less 120 g/L often see ( 40 % patient ) . Patients also genrally old , often co-morbid condition , transfusion palliation frequently give . A randomized , placebo-controlled study evaluate intervention epoetin alfa could significantly improve QoL thus carry hormone refractory prostate cancer patient . It deem intervention , successful , could potential change current clinical practice . Moreover , improve QoL , response increase Hb level , could also lead reduction hospital admission fewer transfusion patient population . Patients receive either 40,000 IU epoetin alfa weekly matching placebo subcutaneously 16 week .</detailed_description>
