	<brief_summary>Aim : To investigate effect high intra- postoperative oxygen concentration ( 80 % , oppose normally 30 % ) surgical wound infection pulmonary complication abdominal surgery . Background : Surgical wound infection common serious complication . Tissue oxygen tension often low surgery resistance infection depend factor bacterial killing neutrophil . Oxygen substrate reaction , hypothesize increase arterial oxygen tension , risk surgical wound infection reduce . Previous study test hypothesis show entirely different result . Hence , clinical decision high normal oxygen concentration still controversial . Primary hypothesis study : Use 80 % oxygen decrease incidence surgical wound infection abdominal surgery . Secondary objective : To investigate effect 80 % oxygen pulmonary complication ( atelectasis , pneumonia , respiratory insufficiency ) , second operation , mortality length postoperative hospitalization admission intensive care unit abdominal surgery .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age 18 year old . Laparotomy , acute elective . In case gynaecological surgery malignancy suspect ( define risk ovarian malignancy index &gt; 200 specimen atypical neoplastic cell ) . Other surgery within 30 day ( except surgery local anaesthesia ) . Chemotherapy within 3 month . Inability give inform consent . Inability keep oxygen saturation 90 % without supplemental oxygen ( measure preoperatively pulse oximetry ) .</criteria>
