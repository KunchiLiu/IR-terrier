	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize trial compare safety efficacy two dose frequency Cerezyme® patient Gaucher disease currently treat Cerezyme® . Approximately 90 patient randomize 2:1 ( q4 : q2 ) ratio one two treatment arm 26 study center worldwide . Patients continue receive total 4-week dose receive prior study enrollment , however , randomize receive either total 4-week dose two infusion , one infusion every 2 week total 4-week dose one infusion every 4 week . The randomization scheme ensure 2:1 balance every 4-week versus every 2-week infusion group , respectively .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The patient must provide write informed consent prior undergoing studyrelated procedure . The patient confirm diagnosis Gaucher disease document deficiency glucocerebrosidase enzyme assay The patient genotyped genotyping perform within 3 month study enrollment . The patient treat Cerezyme least 2 year prior study enrollment . The patient stable dose 2060 U/kg every 2 week least 6 month prior study enrollment . The patient least 18 year old . The patient hemoglobin value ≥ 11.0 g/dL woman ≥ 12.0 g/dL men platelet count ≥ 100,000 mm^3 . The patient 's liver volume ≤ 1.8 x normal confirm MRI CT within 6 month randomization . The patient 's spleen volume ≤ 10 x normal confirm MRI CT within 6 month randomization . The patient serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dL , ASTand ALT &lt; 2 x upper limit normal total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x upper limit normal . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 2 week prior randomization study . The patient pregnant . The patient evidence neurologic pulmonary involvement Gaucher disease confirm medical history . The patient evidence current prior bleed varix liver infarction require hospitalization confirm medical history . The patient evidence pathologic bone fracture , medullary infarction , lytic lesion avascular necrosis secondary Gaucher disease confirm skeletal evaluation within 6 month randomization . The patient bone crisis ( define pain acute onset require immobilization affect area , narcotic relief pain may accompany periosteal elevation , increase white cell count , fever debilitation &gt; 3 day ) within 12 month randomization . Patient receive investigational drug within 30 day start participation trial . Patients may receive investigational product throughout course study . The patient clinically significant disease ( exception symptom relate Gaucher disease ) , include clinically significant cardiovascular , hepatic , immunologic , pulmonary , neurologic , renal disease , medical condition , serious intercurrent illness , extenuate circumstance , opinion Investigator , would preclude participation trial potentially decrease survival Patient medical , emotional , behavioral psychological condition judgment Investigator would interfere patient 's compliance requirement study .</criteria>
