	<brief_summary>Moderate alcohol consumption associate decrease risk diabetes type 2 . This association could mediate improvement insulin sensitivity moderate alcohol consumption . Patients diabetes type 2 impaired glucose tolerance often may decrease fat oxidative capacity oxidative phosphorylation tissue muscle . This could lead accumulation triglyceride storage muscle , could interfere insulin signal . Whether mechanism also play role moderate alcohol consumption unknown investigate study . In addition , moderate alcohol consumption meal lead delay hypoglycemia type 1 diabetes patient . How moderate alcohol consumption affect postprandial glycemic response healthy subject unknown . This secondary objective trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To investigate effect moderate alcohol consumption - enzyme involve fatty acid oxidation , oxidative phosphorylation glycolysis skeletal muscle - transporter fatty acid glucose fat tissue - post-prandial glycemic response healthy , lean overweight , young men Design : Open , randomize , partially diet-controlled , placebo control cross-over design Participants - Description : Healthy , lean overweight young ( 18-40 year ) men - Number : 20 Study substance - Test substance : 100 ml whiskey ( Famous Grouse , 40 % v/v alcohol : â‰ˆ 32 g alcohol ) - Reference substance : 100 ml mineral water ( Spa blauw ) Duration : 2 treatment period 4 week ( 28 day ) Test parameter : - Muscle biopsy activity 3-hydroxy fatty-acyl CoA dehydrogenase , citrate synthase , cytochrome c oxidase - Postprandial glycemic response ( glucose , insulin , GLP-1 , GLP-2 , GIP , glucagon , FFA etc . ) - Insulin sensitivity relate factor ( oral glucose tolerance test , adiponectin , HbA1c ) - Liver enzyme ( safety ) - Body weight - Urinary ethyl glucuronide ( compliance )</detailed_description>
