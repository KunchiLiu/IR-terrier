	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) among common endocrine disorder premenopausal woman , affect 7-10 % population . This syndrome characterized hyperandrogenism , chronic anovulation , frequently , obesity . Hyperandrogenemia seem consistent reproductive phenotype male relative well female relative PCOS woman . This phenotype appear genetic basis PCOS family show significant linkage association marker locus chromosome 19p region insulin receptor ( allele 8 D19S884. ) . This allele also recently find associate metabolic phenotype PCOS probands brother , include increase post-challenge glucose level , apparent defect insulin secretion , especially response sulfonylurea , accelerate weight gain age ( unpublished date ) . Therefore , allele 8 status PCOS probands family member identify reproductive metabolic abnormality . Many epidemiologic study show plausible link low birth weight chronic metabolic disorder manifest hypertension , diabetes obesity later life , suggestive early fetal programming . There evidence support fetal origin PCOS . Female rhesus monkey expose excess androgen utero , bear small gestational age . These animal many reproductive feature PCOS , include increase LH level , irregular ovulation , polycystic ovary functional ovarian hyperandrogenism . Similarly , retrospective cohort study , girl elevate adrenal androgen level PCOS significantly small gestational age birth reproductively normal control girl , suggestive possible fetal origin feature PCOS human study . Molecular mechanism fetal program clearly understood , permanent change gene expression cause early insult may factor . HYPOTHESIS These observation lead new hypothesis etiology PCOS ; genetic variation result hyperandrogenemia lead many reproductive metabolic feature PCOS later life . We directly test hypothesis excess androgen production female offspring woman PCOS . Further , test whether A8 ( + ) female offspring profound change parameter ( increase androgen and/or decrease insulin level fetal life infancy ) compare A8 ( - ) female offspring .</detailed_description>
