	<brief_title>PDA+ : A Personal Digital Assistant Obesity Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An obesity epidemic gaining momentum U.S. VA particular . Among Veterans receive care VA outpatient center year 2000 , prevalence overweight 73 % obesity 33 % . Obesity expensive condition partly contribute development chronic disease . In addition adverse medical consequence , obesity take toll quality life . In general among veteran specifically , obesity associate chronic pain condition . Pain obesity combination adversely affect health-related quality life increase care utilization . To treat obesity , VA patient service implement MOVE ! ( Managing Obesity Veterans Everywhere ) , nationwide , pre-inpatient , pre-surgical standard care . MOVE ! Level 2 ( MOVE2 ! ) , platform study , enroll group treatment patient ready make behavioral change diet physical activity . The current study interface add MOVE2 ! treatment order maximize utility sustainability VA . The intervention current study involve provision personal digital assistant ( PDA ) , hand-held computer decision support tool self-regulate diet activity along staff support ( via telephone e-mail per patient 's preference ) . Experimental Design . The current study 2-group prospective randomize control trial compare effect ( 1 ) Standard Care : MOVE2 ! group weight loss counsel alone ( 2 ) MOVE2 ! + PDA + Support . Specific aim enroll VA primary care sample 150 obese patient meet study criterion chronic pain ready make behavioral change , include enrol MOVE2 ! . Primary outcome ( weight pain ) secondary outcome ( quality life , treatment adherence , healthcare utilization ) measure every 3 month ( baseline , treatment month 3 6 , follow-up month 9 12 ) . Before begin current study , conduct two type formative research . Part 1A : We recruit 15 Veterans obese chronic pain purpose pilot test PDA . Veterans participate one focus group one use PDA one week . Part 1B : We also conduct focus group 10 MOVE ! personnel 10 staff work Hines Primary Care Clinic identify perceived need barrier regard implement PDA intervention . Objective &amp; Hypotheses . To determine whether provision PDA decision support tool plus distance support enhance outcome attainable MOVE2 ! standard care alone . Primary hypothesis obese patient chronic pain randomize MOVE2 ! + PDA + Support ) lose weight 6 month , b ) show great maintenance weight loss 12 month , c ) display great reduction pain intensity pain-related disability randomize Standard Care . Secondary hypothesis MOVE2 ! + PDA + Support , compare Standard Care result : ) improve quality life , b ) great treatment adherence , c ) reduce care utilization . Data Analysis . Outcomes analyze longitudinally intent treat basis . The general analytic approach use longitudinal mixed-effects regression model implement via SAS PROC MIXED . Stratification variable ( age , BMI , gender ) include analysis .</detailed_description>
