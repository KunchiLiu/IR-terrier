	<brief_title>Feasibility n-of-1 Trials - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Whilst large scale randomise control trial ( RCT ) remain scientific `` gold standard '' evaluate therapy clinical medicine , assumption make , treatment effect demonstrate generalisable applicable patient , unlikely true . There inevitably patient benefit particular treatment others . N-of-1 trial mean conduct RCTs individual patient add opportunity use patient generate outcome measure . Patients act control receive treatment comparison , , random sequence . While n-of-1 trial methodology reasonably well specify remain under-exploited little known process aspect conduct trial experience view participate . The time commitment patient health professional inconsiderable may well particular problem recruitment drop . N-of-1 trial rely co-operation individual clinician patient , however , work undertaken explore way patient-practitioner relationship experience view influence progress outcome n-of-1 trial . Patients confirm osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee , select mix gender , age , weight , recruit n-of-1 trial compare either , NSAID ( diclofenac ) simple analgesic ( paracetamol ) standard knee support heat retain support . Patients undergo ( 1 hour ) semi-structured interview trial commences trial complete terminate . Patients treat supports/drugs receive treatment period one/two week respectively , 3 cycle ( order determine random ) . Patients complete daily diary include standard patient questionnaire patient generate outcome measure . Qualitative interview observational method employ study practitioner/ patient relationship ; decision participate ; expectation experience ; appropriateness acceptability research design measure .
