	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) serious sleep disorder person 's breathing restrict sleep . Obese individual OSA increase risk inflammation heart condition , unknown whether risk relate effect OSA obesity . This study evaluate whether OSA obesity play primary role inflammation relate heart disease . The study also determine independent effect OSA obesity insulin resistance blood vessel function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Obesity Obstructive Sleep Apnea Inflammation Heart Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OSA common sleep disorder characterize brief collapse upper airway sleep . This blockage prevent air flow properly lung cause pause breathe . If leave untreated , OSA cause high blood pressure , memory problem , weight gain , impotency , headache . It also associate increase risk inflammation-related heart condition . Obesity common among individual OSA may also associate inflammation . It know , however , whether increase risk heart problem cause primarily inflammatory effect OSA obesity . The common treatment OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) therapy , mask wear nose sleep . Air flow mask maintain level pressure keep throat open . The common treatment obesity weight loss . This study determine primary cause heart-related inflammation evaluate individual combined effect CPAP therapy weight loss program treat obese individual OSA . The study also determine independent effect therapy insulin resistance blood vessel function ( arterial stiffness , central arterial pressure ) . This study enroll obese individual moderate severe OSA total 24 week . Potential participant first take part overnight sleep study University Pennsylvania sleep lab . Sensors monitor body function night , include brain muscle activity , eye movement , heart rate , breathe effort , air flow , blood oxygen level . Eligible participant randomly assign CPAP therapy , weight loss program , combination two . Participants weight loss program receive weekly dietary counsel encourage decrease caloric intake increase physical activity . Participants receive CPAP therapy use CPAP machine night sleep . Study visit participant occur baseline Weeks 6 , 12 , 24 . Blood collected measure level triglyceride , high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol , level C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , inflammation biomarker . Insulin resistance evaluate use glucose tolerance test , blood vessel function evaluate use brachial artery reactivity test artery size blood flow measure ultrasound .</detailed_description>
