	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect age-related cognitive change hear aid benefit base hearing aid compression time constant . The hypothesis people poor work memory skill benefit slow time constant hear aid compression good work memory skill able benefit sophisticated compression algorithm rapid time constant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent research show relevance cognitive function hearing aid evaluation sensitivity age auditory system temporal distortion . The propose investigation examine interaction work memory hearing aid compression method speech recognition background competition old listener . This interaction investigate follow three form background competition : 1 . Competition continuous speech-shaped noise . 2 . Competition speech-modulated noise . 3 . Competition single interfering talker . The goal study accomplish two phase . In first phase , 160 adult age 50 75 year evaluate battery test determine cognitive capacity , time-compressed speech score candidacy inclusion second phase study . At conclusion phase testing , participant divide three group : 1. subject TCS test score high quartile ( HIGH group ) 2. subject TCS test score low quartile ( LOW group ) 3. remain listener The second phase experiment include listener HIGH LOW group . These subject evaluate respect speech recognition ability three type interference ( steady-state noise , speech-modulated noise , single interfere talker ) . The HINT test ( Nilsson , Soli , &amp; Sumida , 1995 ; Nilsson et al. , 1994 ) use obtain signal-to-noise ratio ( SNR ) 50 % recognition three masking condition three type amplification : 1. one- channel linear amplification ( LINEAR ) frequency shape 2. two-channel wide dynamic range compression fast time constant ( FAST ) 3. two-channel wide dynamic range compression slow time constant ( SLOW ) Listener group compare across hear aid condition across background interference condition .</detailed_description>
