	<detailed_description>The unifying goal work develop new approach prevention urinary tract infection ( UTI ) person spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . Most individual SCI neurogenic bladder , result urinary stasis bladder catheterization predispose recurrent UTI . Currently , , measure effective prevention UTI person neurogenic bladder . Bacterial interference , use benign bacteria prevent infection virulent pathogen , may offer solution significant problem recurrent episodes UTI person SCI . Two trial person SCI instill nonpathogenic Escherichia coli ( 83972 ) directly bladder demonstrate strong association colonization non-pathogen decreased frequency UTI . However , successful colonization rate direct inoculation method low ( 51-62 % ) . Since urinary catheter-associated biofilm , bacteria plus extracellular matrix , continually seed bladder bacteria , propose use urinary catheter pre-coated biofilm E. coli 83972 mean achieve bladder colonization . Our recently complete pilot ( B3248P ) demonstrate insertion urinary catheter pre-coated E. coli ( 83972 ) effective safe method achieve bladder colonization potentially protective strain . The rate successful colonization E. coli-coated catheter high ( 10 12 subject , 83 % ) . However , pilot limited subpopulation SCI veteran utilize chronic indwelling catheter bladder drainage . The current proposal expand upon previous work widen range eligible subject simplify colonization protocol . Since intermittent catheterization program ( ICP ) prefer common mean manage neurogenic bladder chronic catheterization , plan test E. coli 83972-coated catheter person SCI use ICP bladder drainage . We hypothesize short-term use ( 3 day ) E. coli 83972-coated catheter person SCI practice ICP lead successful colonization ( persist 28 day ) majority subject . We also record subject ' rate symptomatic UTI colonize E. coli 83972 compare rate subject ' baseline rate year prior study entry . Subjects able remove study catheter home submit urine sample mail , colonization process simple convenient . If successful colonization achieve pilot trial , large clinical trial design test efficacy catheter prevent UTI person SCI .</detailed_description>
