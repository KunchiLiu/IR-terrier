	<detailed_description>The purpose retrospective pilot study address effect obesity , absence comorbidities , birth weight . We wish determine obesity risk factor small gestational age ( SGA ) intrauterine growth restrict ( IUGR ) infants clinic population . There many study link maternal obesity fetal macrosomia , define fetal birth weight great 4500 gram . However , note percentage obese patient population deliver either SGA IUGR infant . SGA refers constitutionally small infant weigh less 10th percentile age . This refer genetically normal infant . IUGR refers fetus whose growth restrict influence normal genetics . Obesity define body mass index ( BMI ) great 30 World Health Organization National Institutes Health . This relevant topic health care today one-third adult woman fall category obese . As number increase , face challenge provide comprehensive prenatal care woman . Risk factor IUGR particular include hypertension , renal disease , restrictive lung disease , diabetes , cyanotic heart disease , antiphospholipid syndrome , collagen vascular disease , hemoglobinopathy , tobacco drug use , severe malnutrition , placental disease , multiple gestation , infection , genetic disorder , teratogenic exposure . The child bear condition great risk hypothermia , hypoglycemia , apneic episode , seizure , sepsis , neonatal death . Long term problem usually develop base cause SGA IUGR status catch growth-wise child age . Previous study link condition higher incidence hypertension cardiovascular problem . The basic screening condition simple fundal height measurement , likely physical find uterine size less date . It questionable accurate measurement obese population measurement take layer abdominal fat . Obesity pregnant patient link increase rate hypertension , preeclampsia , gestational preexisting diabetes . Although many study also link fetal macrosomia maternal obesity , study publish within last year relate maternal obesity SGA IUGR infant . A Danish study look cohort woman deliver singleton infant . They look pregnancy complication include diabetes , hypertension , preeclampsia , cesarean delivery . The study population include delivery 37-42 week gestation . Women hypertension preexist diabetes include study population . The finding include high risk macrosomic infant general study population . In small segment study population , however , find increase incidence SGA infant IUGR infant . This hint possible relationship obesity SGA control variable . A study Medical University South Carolina look prepregnancy weight subsequent weight gain . It cohort study use birth certificate information link South Carolina Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System , system telephone mail survey , collect data study . The result include 1.8 time great likelihood obese woman deliver low birth weight infant ( 3 ) . Study Population Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Our study population consist woman age 18 delivered term infant either vaginal delivery cesarean section Tulsa Regional Medical Center July 1st 2004 December 31st 2005 . We choose time frame feel give adequate sample size approximately 160 woman study group 260 control group , allow completion project within 12 18 month . Our statistician , Dr. Mark Payton , complete power analysis number , include submission . We define term infant 37 week gestation great . They must least one visit Houston Park Ob-Gyn clinic , include initial prenatal lab visit , delivery . Our study population consist mainly Medicaid patient , low socioeconomic status . The ethnic blend study population include Caucasian , African-American , Hispanic , American Indian , Asian woman . Our study population BMI great equal 30 base initial record weight record height . We exclude woman multiple gestation , hypothyroidism , hyperthyroidism , heart disease , tobacco drug use , gestational preexisting diabetes , autoimmune disease form , hypertension , collagen vascular disease , disease process result decrease gastrointestinal nutrient absorption , lung disease condition know risk factor IUGR ( 5 ) . Early Termination Criteria N/A Methods/Procedures Diagnosis The diagnosis obesity base upon initial weight height record patient chart , typically first trimester , derive BMI ( weight kilograms/height meter square ) . Although total weight gain term pregnancy could add enough BMI falsely indicate obesity , since use initial weight record , difficulty minimize . The cutoff study group BMI thirty great definition obesity World Health Organization National Institutes Health . We look infant birth weight record patient 's chart . We define SGA IUGR birth weight less 10th percentile gestational age define previously . The control group consist woman meet criterion except BMI le thirty great 19.8 low maternal weight also risk factor IUGR . Data Collection The collaborating investigator research assistant collect follow information patient chart : age , height , weight initial visit , date delivery , infant birth weight , smoke status , abovementioned comorbidities would exclude patient study . No data collect patient chart . We utilize research assistant collection data , research assistant OSU medical student employ work study program work project . They collect data clinic record . They basic human research HIPAA training allow access patient chart information fall OSU community individual privilege . Analysis We compare average birth weight rate SGA/IUGR infant two group . We analyze result use chi-squared method analysis . Confidentiality The clinic record review kept Houston Park medical record department either lock security supervision time . The hospital record keep Tulsa Regional Medical Center health information management department . This department lock 24 hour day . No identify information individual 's chart record , de-identification occur data collect , master list patient names identify information keep .</detailed_description>
