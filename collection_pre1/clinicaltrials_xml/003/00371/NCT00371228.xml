	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether time clamp umbilical cord delivery impact neonatal hemoglobin hematocrit , test determine number red cell blood ability carry oxygen . The study hypothesis delay cord clamp cord pulsation cease increase neonatal blood volume thereby increase hemoglobin hematocrit . We propose recruit 150 woman present vaginal delivery Tulsa Regional Medical Center . Half woman randomly assign immediate clamping group , entail clamp umbilical cord within six second delivery fetal shoulder . The half volunteer assign delayed clamp group , entail clamp cord palpable pulse cease , 10 minute . The infant mother group blood draw hemoglobin hematocrit time routine PKU heel stick , usually perform within 18-24 hour delivery .

	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine whether time clamp umbilical cord delivery impact neonatal hemoglobin hematocrit , test determine number red cell blood ability carry oxygen . The study hypothesis delay cord clamp cord pulsation cease increase neonatal blood volume thereby increase hemoglobin hematocrit . As communication placenta fetus , umbilical cord provide oxygen nutrient time delivery . Even delivery , placental respiration continue short time newborn infant continue receive blood placenta physiologic closure cord vessel terminate transfusion . While term infant tolerate variation blood volume , compromised prematurity , cesarean delivery cord compression utero may require blood transfusion cord clamp pulmonary perfusion establish . Delayed cord clamp believe provide great supply blood perfuse lung without rob blood organ . In uncomplicated vaginal delivery umbilical cord traditionally clamp immediately delivery , doctor 's convenience consideration regard health infant . Both immediate delayed cord clamp accept routine standard care delivery , depend circumstance . However , clinicians researcher suggest delay clamp umbilical cord , placental transfusion newborn maintain , optimize blood volume hemostasis . Several European research study suggest delayed cord clamping increase newborn hemoglobin hematocrit . However , study perform properly control condition thus fail gain general acceptance . We propose recruit 150 woman present vaginal delivery Tulsa Regional Medical Center . We believe number volunteer possible enroll allot five month data collection . A power analysis sample size perform Dr. Mark Payton , professor statistic OSU Stillwater campus . He estimate difference 0.3 standard deviation power 95 % . OSU medical student explain study recruit patient volunteer routine third trimester prenatal care visit OSU OB/Gyn resident clinic Houston Parke . Study investigator Drs . Beal Carnett determine eligibility patient agree participate . The ethnic mix resident clinic population available race information routinely enter MegaWest Practice Management Program currently use . When volunteer present delivery , resident charge labor delivery unit remind patient previous consent participate assign either control group study group alternate fashion . Women agree participate study identify mark prenatal record send clinic . In control group , umbilical cord clamp immediately delivery . In study group , umbilical cord clamp cord pulsation cease . Patients also advise time withdraw study time , regardless reason . The physician making group assignment perform delivery give day may one study investigator . The inability mask patient study personnel affect outcome study strict guideline regard timing cord clamp apply . Immediate clamp entail clamp umbilical cord within six second delivery fetal shoulder . Delayed clamp perform clamp cord palpable pulse cease , 10 minute . Cord pulsation generally stop within two minute delivery . The physician performing delivery determine cord pulsation stop clamp time , immediate delay record delivery room personnel routinely record time delivery infant , delivery placenta , infant weight APGARs . Therefore , prior knowledge group assignment affect behavior patient physician time delivery . The infant mother group blood draw hemoglobin hematocrit time routine PKU heel stick . There additional heel stick collect blood . The PKU test usually perform within 18-24 hour delivery . All infant study data collect time blood draw necessary . The total amount blood drawn baby approximately 8-10 drop , two teaspoon , include blood PKU test study test . The result blood test analyze compare two group . This comparison also involve analysis mother ' admit hemoglobin hematocrit , blood type demographic data , include age smoking history , look possible exclusion confound factor . Maternal blood routinely test time admission blood type , hemoglobin hematocrit . This involve collection approximately two test tube blood . No additional testing blood collection perform participate mother routinely do . There increased risk mother infant agree participate study . Likewise , direct benefit participation either mother baby aside contribution participation make further medical knowledge . Adverse event serious adverse event record report IRB policy procedure provide OSUCHS . Our tentative timetable recruit 25 patient per month data collection complete within five month . Tulsa Regional typically deliver 1,000 baby monthly . Approximately 23 percent delivery cesarean section . Of remain delivery , reasonable estimate 25 patient per month could recruit study . The study population include 150 woman newborn infant deliver Tulsa Regional Medical Center . Mothers must age 18 34 full term , 37 41 week , singleton pregnancy time delivery . Women exclude study delivery complicate non-reassuring fetal heart tone , preeclampsia , eclampsia , chronic hypertension , meconium-stained amniotic fluid , fetal anomaly condition could require immediate newborn evaluation nursery personnel time delivery . Infants require operative delivery forceps vacuum also exclude . Analysis Statistical difference blood count infant control study group compare use independent sample test .</detailed_description>
