	<brief_summary>Malaria cause parasite carried mosquito . Currently , vaccine license prevent malaria . The purpose study find effective safest dose experimental vaccine treatment malaria . Participants include 72 healthy adult , ages18 45 , enrol Vanderbilt University Medical Center Stanford University . Volunteers receive 3 dos either malaria vaccine placebo ( contain vaccine ) injection muscle 0 , 1 6 month . Investigators evaluate body responds increase dosage strength vaccine . Study procedure include physical exam , multiple blood draw , completion memory aid ( diary ) . Each participant actively involve study 12 month . Then , annual phone call make check serious illness event period 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malaria currently represent one prevalent infection tropical subtropical area throughout world . Each year , malaria affect around 300 million people kill 1 3 million people develop country . The widespread occurrence grow incidence malaria consequence increase number drug-resistant parasite insecticide-resistant parasite vector . Other factor include environmental climatic change , civil disturbance increase mobility population . It hypothesize Ad35.CS.01 vaccine prevent Plasmodium ( P. ) falciparum parasite , cause malaria , enter develop within liver become infected . Ad35.CS.01 would therefore expect reduce malaria-attributable morbidity mortality . The purpose phase I , randomize , control , dosage-escalation trial evaluate immunogenicity , safety , reactogenicity Adenovirus Type 35 base circumsporozoite malaria vaccine 72 healthy adult , 18 45 year age , United States . Subjects randomize 5:1 ratio receive 3 dos Adenovirus Type 35 circumsporozoite malaria vaccine ( Ad35.CS.01 ) normal saline placebo control intramuscular route 0 , 1 6 month . The safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity ascend dosage vaccine assess . Fifteen subject receive vaccine follow dosage level : 10^8 viral particle ( vp ) /milliliters ( ml ) , 10^9 vp/ml , 10^10 vp/ml 10^11 vp/ml 3 subject receive control dosage level . Dosage escalation proceed review safety data Safety Monitoring Committee prior dosage level . The primary objective ass safety reactogenicity ascend dosage Adenovirus Type 35 base circumsporozoite malaria vaccine among healthy subject give 3 intramuscular dos 0 , 1 6 month . The secondary objective evaluate immunogenicity Adenovirus Type 35 base circumsporozoite malaria vaccine performance Humoral Immune Assays [ ELISA ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ) ] antibody circumsporozoite antigen Adenovirus Neutralization Assay neutralize antibody Adenovirus type 35 ) Cellular Immune Assays [ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot ( ELISPOT ) Flow Cytometry ] circumsporozoite ( CS ) -specific cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+ CD8+ T cell response .</detailed_description>
