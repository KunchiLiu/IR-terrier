	<brief_summary>ABSTRACT CONTEXT : Inappropriate antibiotic prescription acute bronchitis major public health concern antibiotic resistance . Effective therapy manage symptom acute bronchitis lacking , however . OBJECTIVE : Determine patient acute bronchitis well symptom control treat inhaled ipratropium . DESIGN , SETTING , PARTICIPANTS : COUGH STOP randomize , double blind , placebo control trial compare ipratropium placebo acute bronchitis . Subjects refer primary care provider urgent care clinic single institution . Subjects diagnose acute bronchitis significant co-morbidities . INTERVENTION : Subjects receive ipratropium placebo inhaler , administer 2 puff four time daily . A structured telephone interview take place 2 , 4 , 8 day enrollment . Medical record review 60 day . OUTCOME : The primary endpoint improvement cough symptomology ; secondary endpoint include subsequent antibiotic prescription `` well . ''</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>METHODS COUGH STOP investigator-initiated study . We conduct prospective , randomize , double blind , placebo control trial test hypothesis ipratropium would improve cough symptom otherwise healthy subject acute bronchitis . Subjects enrol October 9th 2002 November 1 2003 , include cough without sputum production le 30 day duration ; age 18 65 ; willing follow phone brief interview 2 , 4 , 8 day enrollment . Subjects exclude history COPD ; asthma ; lung disease ; localize lung finding exam suggest pneumonia asthma ; chest X-ray ( do ) evidence pneumonia ; purulent nasal discharge evidence bacterial sinus infection ; evidence streptococcal pharyngitis ; temperature great 101.5 precede 72 hour ; treatment respiratory tract infection last 30 day ; pregnancy ; breast feeding ; actively try become pregnant ; history heart failure ; history renal failure insufficiency creatinine great 2.0 mg/dl ; history psychiatric illness minor depression ; currently incarcerate ; unwilling sign consent form . The study review approve IRB facility , approve FDA way IND application . Subjects either refer one study investigator practice physician nurse practitioner facility , enrol member team directly . Subjects give copy consent form , ask review ask question . Those signed consent form randomly assign treatment ipratropium placebo meter dose inhaler ( MDI ) . The assignment key maintain pharmacy one investigator interaction subject data collection process . Subjects received training use MDI spacer device member study team . Subjects instructed take two puff study MDI four time day next 8 day . After first 8 day instruct use study MDI need basis thought benefit . During structured enrollment interview subject ask follow question : How long cough ( number day ) ? What symptoms ? Are produce sputum ? Do smoke ? Are cough night ? If `` Yes , '' interrupt sleep ? Have stop working/daily activity ? Are fever ? If `` Yes , '' high ? What over-the-counter medication use ? During follow telephone interview , day 2 , 4 , 8 enrollment , subject ask similar shorter set question : Are still cough ? Is cough well , bad , ? Are produce sputum ? Is sputum production well , bad , ? Are cough night ? If `` Yes , '' interrupt sleep ? Have return work/daily activity ? Has sense well return ? Are fever ? If `` Yes , '' high ? Are side effect medication ? If `` Yes , '' ? Are problem use inhaler ? If `` Yes , '' please describe . What over-the-counter medication use ? Subjects give medical advice follow interview advise address medical question primary care physician . Medical record review two month enrollment , frequency return clinic visit , medication prescription , especially antibiotic , complication relate study enrollment . Subjects either subsequent antibiotic prescription clinic visit respiratory complaint 60 day follow study enrollment audit medical record . Subjects prescribed antibiotic period record review follow : antibiotic prescribed ; long enrollment prescribe ; prescribe . This data collect separate database review blinded fashion entire research team inclusion final analysis . All decision unanimous , base follow factor : diagnosis time prescription consistent upper respiratory tract infection ( URI ) ; antibiotic prescribed consistent treatment URI ; case diagnosis time prescription could determine , subject include secondary analysis antibiotic prescribed consistent treatment URI . Subjects exclude analysis diagnosis time prescription consistent URI antibiotic prescribe consistent treatment URI . Similarly , subject clinic visit subsequent sixty-days record audit . Data collect separate database review blinded fashion entire team . Again , decision unanimous , criteria inclusion diagnosis time visit consistent URI . Statistical Analysis Power analysis indicate sample size approximately 100 subject treatment control arm would sufficient detect 33 % reduction cough frequency experimental arm receiving ipratropium , assume =.05 b =.20 , use two- tailed z-statistic . Calculation standard effect size power analysis base upon extrapolation Hueston 's Melbye 's data13 15 albuterol fenoterol use acute bronchitis , assume similar effect ipratropium . Effect size calculation base upon publish value relative risk reference . Power analysis perform outcome variable . Data analyze intention-to-treat basis , accord randomize assignment . The ipratropium placebo arm compare : self-reported cough severity [ , good , bad ] ; cough duration [ present , present ] day 2 , 4 , 8 ; , well-being [ well , not-well ] day 2 , 4 , 8 ; work absence [ attend work , work ] day 2 , 4 , 8 . Proportions rate non-continuous group variable compare use chi-square test . Normally distribute continuous variable , cough duration , compare treatment arm use two-tailed t-test .</detailed_description>
