	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate activity SU011248 subject cisplatin-refractory multiply relapse germ cell cancer . It believe SU011248 treatment may prove increase disease response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase-II Study SU011248 ( Sunitinib ) Male Patients With Relapsed Cisplatin-Refractory Germ Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SU011248 new investigational drug show effective kidney cancer cancer clinical trial . An investigational drug Canada drug yet approve standard treatment . SU011248 inhibit enzyme ( chemical help cell function ) call tyrosine kinase , important enzyme tumor growth tumor spread body . If enzymes block , tumor growth may disrupt subsequently cancer cell may die . SU011248 give patient kidney cancer cancer clinical trial improve , although yet certain often occur . There evidence enzyme inhibit SU011248 also play important role development growth germ cell cancer . This reason SU011248 test subject germ cell cancer . Objectives : Primary : To assess response rate SU011248 patient relapse cisplatin- refractory germ cell cancer . Secondary : To assess rate disease stabilization , toxicity , time progression response duration SU011248 give patient relapse cisplatin-refractory germ cell cancer . Study Drug Regimen : SU011248 give 50 mg daily 4 consecutive week follow 2-week rest period comprise complete cycle 6 week . SU011248 orally self-administered daily without regard meal . Patients remain study drug disease progression .</detailed_description>
