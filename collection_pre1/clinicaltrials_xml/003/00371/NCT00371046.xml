	<brief_summary>The objective study investigate effect use sonographic cervical length ( CL ) fetal fibronectin ( FFN ) length outpatient triage preterm labor intervention symptomatic woman intact membrane . We perform randomize trial use transvaginal ultrasound cervical length fetal fibronectin woman evaluate suspected PTL gestational age 24 33 week 6 day . Women randomize either standard ( blind ) protocol arm . Women standard arm evaluate without result CL FFN woman protocol arm evaluate use result CL FFN manage physician ask follow specific PTL algorithm determine woman ’ eligibility treatment . The primary outcome length stay triage area discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Fetal Fibronectin Ultrasound Cervical Length Help Evaluation Women With Suspected Preterm Labor ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients present sign symptom suggestive preterm labor ( PTL ) represent clinical challenge . Many study show 70 % woman evaluate PTL deliver within 7 day almost 40 % woman , whether treat , deliver term . On hand , 20 % woman think PTL deliver preterm . Women diagnose PTL expose variety evidence non-evidenced base intervention include hospital admission , tocolysis , antenatal steroid , maternal transfer bedrest . These intervention associate maternal risk increase health care cost often harmful social , financial psychological effect mother well family . Therefore , method accurately evaluate risk preterm delivery symptomatic woman would help identify would benefit standard clinical intervention help reduce use woman would deliver preterm . A number retrospective cohort study demonstrate use fetal fibronectin ( FFN ) transvaginal sonographic cervical length ( TVU CL ) improve prediction standard digital exam , combination two add prognostic information woman admit PTL . The objective study investigate effect use sonographic cervical length fetal fibronectin length outpatient triage preterm labor intervention symptomatic woman intact membrane . Methods : Study design This randomize trial use transvaginal ultrasound cervical length fetal fibronectin woman evaluate suspected PTL labor delivery Thomas Jefferson University Hospital , Philadelphia November 2004 April 2006 . The study approve Internal Review Board . Gestational age assign last menstrual period first early second trimester ultrasound . If last menstrual period unknown discrepancy regard date , ultrasound date use . Eligible woman agree participate study randomize either standard protocol arm . At time study initiate neither FFN CL routinely use management symptomatic woman present L &amp; D evaluate PTL . Women standard arm evaluate without result CL FFN woman protocol arm evaluate use CL FFN manage physician ask follow specific PTL algorithm determine woman ’ eligibility treatment . Physicians encourage manage protocol patient accord study recommend protocol use FFN CL , review patient labor delivery study investigator . Once eligible treatment , management PTL leave discretion physician . Definitions study procedure Before randomization patient evaluate preterm labor monitor triage area uterine activity fetal heart rate evaluate . A speculum exam perform rule rupture membrane obtain specimen fetal fibronectin . Specimens fetal fibronectin obtain Dacron swab posterior vaginal fornix place buffer hold labor delivery patient either randomize , determine ineligible decline participate study . After randomization specimen immediately analyze house laboratory . Samples deliver laboratory within 1 hour obtain sample result available within 1 hour . Samples contain 50 ng per milliliter designate positive . The FFN delay 24-36 hour need patient intercourse , pelvic exam transvaginal ultrasound within 24 hour . A digital exam perform determine dilatation effacement cervix . Results fibronectin analysis label one study investigator randomization result non-blinded specimen would available manage physician . Randomization perform mean computer generate random block number seal opaque envelops stratify two group base gestational age &lt; 28 week ≥ 28 week . Each envelope open sequentially within stratum one study investigator . Following randomization , transvaginal ultrasound assessment cervix perform . Measurements obtain use 5-7.5 Mhz transvaginal probe place anterior fornix empty bladder . The transducer orient obtain sagittal view cervix , long axis view echogenic endocervical mucosa along length canal . The probe withdrawn slightly image blur , enough pressure reapplied restore image . CL measure internal external o along endocervical canal . At least three measurement record 5 minute shortest best measurement millimeter use study . Using two-sided t-test alpha 0.05 , calculate sample size 45 patient group would 80 % power detect 1 hour ( 33 % ) mean time labor &amp; delivery ( 3.0 hr 2.0 hr , assume standard deviation 1.0 ) . These assumption base survey take Labor Delivery triage database 6 month prior study .</detailed_description>
