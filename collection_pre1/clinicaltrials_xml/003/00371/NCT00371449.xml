	<brief_summary>The primary complaint individual hear loss difficulty understand speech presence background noise . Although hear aid help individual understand speech background noise well , high rate hearing aid rejection part due continue difficulty understand speech complex listening situation . The result study may demonstrate speech-in-noise test result predictor hear aid success . The result study also may lead study evaluate intervention improve hear aid success individual identify unsuccessful hearing aid user .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Predicting Success With Hearing Aids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As numerous study report , common complaint individual sensorineural hearing loss hear hear speech understand speech , especially background noise . For type hearing loss type hear loss , hear aid intervention choice . The majority individual receive hearing aid successful hearing-aid user subjectively objectively function well hearing aid without hear aid . Other individual unsuccessful hearing-aid user variety reason perception hearing aid enable function well . Two study ( Popelka et al. , 1998 ; Kockchin , 2000 ) indicate 25 % individual receive hearing aid consider unsuccessful hearing-aid user . If potentially ( un ) successful hearing-aid user identify , audiologic rehabilitation program design use potentially successful hearing-aid user extensive audiologic rehabilitation program design use individual potentially unsuccessful hearing-aid user . Data recent series study N b lek colleague ( 1991 , 2004 ) indicate successful unsuccessful hearing-aids user predict base performance subjective speech-in-noise task comfortable listen level establish travelogue story level multitalker babble establish permit follow travelogue . The difference two level acceptable noise level ( ANL ) . Based ANL data , N b lek et al . ( 2006 ) report 85 % confidence individual successful hearing-aid user unsuccessful hearing-aid user . One premise proposal ANL fact estimate subjective realm signal-to-noise ( S/N ) listener comfortable listen speech signal background noise . Recently laboratory words-in-noise ( WIN ) test develop involves presentation word multitalker babble signal-to-babble ( S/B ) ratios 24- 0-dB 4-dB decrement . The 50 % point function calculate Spearman-K rber equation . This objective instrument provide average 8-dB separation recognition performances listener normal hear listener hear loss . The 50 % point listener normal hear 0- 6-dB S/B , whereas 50 % point listener hearing loss 8- 16-dB S/B . Thus , WIN sensitive effect hear loss speech understanding , WIN provide range performance listener hear loss . The propose study design answer follow two key question : 1 . What relationship ANL performance ( subjective paradigm ) WIN performance ( objective paradigm ) unaided aided condition ? 2 . How well ANL WIN score predict subjective hearing-aid outcome domain ( use , satisfaction , benefit , global ) ? In addition , study design enable multiple comparison make among several study variable among many traditional variable age , pure-tone threshold , word-recognition ability quiet . Future goal beyond proposal involve development ( 1 ) systematic protocol select amplification device specific feature amplification base WIN ANL performance , ( 2 ) audiologic rehabilitation program administer quickly effectively ( depend category hearing-aid success determine performance WIN ANL ) veterans receive hear aid .</detailed_description>
