	<brief_summary>This study examine part brain use visual information perform movement . Patients certain brain lesion tend difficulty processing visually present object . This study look brain mechanism underlie visuo-motor integration . Healthy normal volunteer 20 60 year age eligible study . People severe head injury loss consciousness mental neurological disorder diagnose doctor may participate . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination focus finger movement , questionnaire . Participants ' brain activity record use two technique - magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) - watch picture various object flash screen . MEG procedure record magnetic field change produce brain activity . During record , subject sit comfortably armchair dimly lit room watch picture present screen . About 50 picture show per session . There five session , separate 3-minute break . Functional MRI involve take picture brain use MRI subject performs task . MRI use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . The MRI scanner metal cylinder surround magnetic field . The subject lie still table slide scanner . During scan , look picture six test block 1 minute , 30-second break block .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Patients frontal lobe lesion tend grasp visually present object automatically forcefully ( forced grasping ) . Grasping milder form see infant age population . These fact suggest presence inherent mechanism suppress automatic tendency toward grasp healthy adult brain . Previous study suggest parieto-frontal network , especially lateral premotor cortex , play role cognition graspable object execution reaching/grasping . Although task reaching/grasping human being study mainly neuroimaging technique , cognitive executive aspect clearly distinguish . Therefore , project aim elucidate mechanism underlie 'automatic grasp ' human , focus perceptive/cognitive aspect reaching/grasping movement . Study population design : Pictures graspable object non-graspable object visually present 45 healthy adult volunteer . Since study aim clarify mechanism human brain automatically recognize graspable object , part study require response task . Additionally , order ass automatic function compare overt mechanism , extra test session explore make overt judgment picture . Outcome measure : The brain activation investigate event-related magnetic field , high temporal resolution , event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , relatively high spatial resolution . It expect lateral premotor cortex , addition parietal cortex , activate visual presentation graspable object short latency , strongly , compare non-graspable object , even without actual motor task follow . Additionally , overt grasp graspable object involve similar area .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy male female subject age 20 60 year old eligible within limit exclusion criterion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A previous history neurological disease carefully take direct interview Principal Associate Investigators . Subjects head injury ( severe enough cause loss consciousness ) brain disease cause mental disturbance , sensory impairment , motor dysfunction past exclude . Subjects metal either mouth , dental prosthesis , head , surgical clip previous surgical procedure , also exclude due technical limitation term MEG . Furthermore , subject wear glass visual correction poor vision , even contact lens , exclude also due technical limitation MEG . Subjects pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , dental implant , aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) , permanent eyeliner , implanted delivery pump , shrapnel fragment , welder metal worker exclude MRI sake safety subject . Finally , brief neurological examination finger movement , subject poor performance fine finger movement judge mirror movement exclude .</criteria>
