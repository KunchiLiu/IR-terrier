	<detailed_description>This research protocol outline multi-site clinical trial adjunctive estradiol woman Schizophrenia . We propose recruit 180 woman study 3 Australian sit - The Alfred Hospital , Barwon Health , Dandenong Hospital . 1.1 Literature Review Schizophrenia severe mental disorder affect 2 % adult population . Patients present variety symptom include hallucination , delusion bizarre behaviour develop additional `` negative '' symptom amotivational state poverty think . Schizophrenia generally think organic brain disorder psychosocial determinant course outcome . The illness appear heterogenous group patient present distinct differ pattern psychopathology illness course . Part heterogeneity include distinct male female subtypes schizophrenia . In recent time , gender difference schizophrenia receive attention , particular epidemiological psychopathological perspective . Hormonal study utilise investigate underlying neuroendocrine disturbance schizophrenia , information study use development new gender specific treatment strategy . Overall treatment schizophrenia remain gender-blind . The main gender difference observe schizophrenia international consensus include later age onset woman ; good response antipsychotic woman ; treatment resistant negative symptom men . Women also demonstrate vulnerability psychotic episode menopause , post-partum period low estrogen phase menstrual cycle . From clinical observation , Seeman Lang ( 1990 ) hypothesise estrogen may provide `` protection '' early onset severe schizophrenia woman , thereby account increase vulnerability lifetime monthly low estrogen phase . Seeman Lang ( 1990 ) hypothesise estrogen may provide protection early onset severe treatment resistant schizophrenia anti-dopaminergic effect modulate sensitivity dopamine receptor thereby potentiate effect antipsychotic . Evidence estrogen modulate effect dopaminergic system come study rat estrogens enhance antipsychotic-induced cataplexy ( Behrens et al . 1992 ; Fields et al 1982 ) reduce amphetamine apomorphine-induced behaviour stereotypies ( Ferretti et al. , 1992 ; Clopton et al. , 1986 ) . In human , presence estrogen receptor limbic system indicate estrogen may neuromodulatory function ( Foreman , et al. , 1980 ; Koller , et al. , 1980 ; Gordon et al. , 1980 ) . Estrogens show reduce dopamine concentration striatum ( Dupond et al. , 1981 ; Bedard et al. , 1984 ) modulate sensitivity well number dopamine receptor ( Di Paolo , et al. , 1981 ; McDermott , et al. , 1994 ) . There clinical case report woman whose schizophrenic symptomatology exacerbate low estrogen phase menstrual cycle ( Endo et al. , 1978 ) . Similarly clinical case report woman chronic schizophrenia improve pregnancy - estrogen level extremely high ( Seeman , 1986 ) . After delivery , estrogen level drop , increased vulnerability psychosis observe ( Seeman , 1996 ) . A recent study investigate relationship schizophrenia psychopathology low estrogen phase menstrual cycle reveal symptom improve natural estradiol level increase ( Riecher-Rossler et al. , 1994 ) . This study also show 32 patient study markedly reduce serum estradiol level compare normal population fluctuation throughout cycle dampen . 1.2 Justification Project The finding basic clinical research review section 1.1 warrant investigation hypothesis estrogen protective effect woman , female life cycle , also menstrual cycle . Case report appear literature clinician detail improvement one two female patient follow administration synthetic combine estrogen progesterone . A study conduct Klaiber colleague ' ( 1979 ) report large dos estrogen assist treatment depression woman . We conduct clinical trial patient schizophrenia use estrogen treatment many year , international reputation work area . Initially , conduct open clinical trial acutely ill schizophrenic woman ( Kulkarni et al. , 1996 ) add 0.02mg oral estradiol antipsychotic drug treatment 11 woman . Their response compare seven woman receive antipsychotic drug alone . The estrogen adjunct group show dramatic earlier improvement , significant reduction positive psychotic symptom day 3 treatment . This suggest estradiol may act catalyst treatment could prove important adjunctive treatment therapy schizophrenia . Subsequent early pilot study , conduct double blind placebo control 3-arm study 100mcg , 50mcg estradiol placebo transdermal adjunctive patch . Published Schizophrenia Research ( Kulkarni et al. , 2003 ) , result show 100mcg estrogen adjunct afford best outcomes . We conduct `` proof concept '' study examine effect add 100mcg transdermal estrogen versus transdermal placebo antipsychotic drug treatment 90 woman schizophrenia . For result 'proof concept ' study please refer Appendix G. 1.3 Review Estradiol Uses Estrogen one group hormonal steroid compound promote development female secondary sex characteristic . Human estrogen produce ovary , adrenal cortex , testis , feto-placental unit . Along progesterone , estrogen play major role regulation menstrual cycle regulate level Luteinizing Hormone ( LH ) Follicle Stimulating Hormone ( FSH ) release anterior pituitary gland brain . These two gonadotropin hormone turn regulated action hypothalamus . Pharmaceutical preparation estrogen use oral contraceptive , palliate post-menopausal breast cancer prostatic cancer , inhibit lactation , treat threaten abortion , osteoporosis ovarian disease . Estrogen also give relieve discomfort menopause . Types estrogen conjugate estrogen , esterify estrogen , estradiol , estriol estrone ( Mosby , 1986 ) . Delivery estrogen transdermal patch provide natural physiologically equivalent replacement estradiol level . 2 . RESEARCH OBJECTIVES To conduct three-arm , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , trial across three site , investigate 'estrogen-protection ' hypothesis woman schizophrenia . The study aim : 1. replicate previous research , thereby provide 'proof concept ' potential use estradiol treatment woman schizophrenia ; 2. investigate effect increase dose estradiol ( 200mcg transdermal ) ; 3. investigate duration `` antipsychotic effect '' estradiol The aim meet compare change psychopathology cognition 8-week period three group participant : ( 1 ) group participant receive standard antipsychotic treatment placebo ; ( 2 ) match group receive standard antipsychotic treatment plus 100mcg estradiol patch ; ( 3 ) match group receive standard antipsychotic treatment plus 200mcg estradiol patch . 3 . ETHICS REVIEW AND INFORMED CONSENT 3.1 Ethics Review The protocol study approve Alfred Research &amp; Ethics Committee 6th January 2005 , Barwon site 01/03/2006 , Dandenong site 12/05/2006 . 3.2 Issues Related Use Estradiol Skin Patches The study involve addition 100mcg/200mcg estradiol standard antipsychotic treatment 8 week . This dose estradiol commonly use hormone replacement therapy postmenopausal woman , without side effect . The length trial 2 menstrual cycle , short period estrogen use . Most side effect commonly associate estrogen use relate long term administration thus applicable study . Basic medical precaution take prior commencement estrogen therapy ( ie . physical examination , routine investigation pregnancy test ) . In large study 90 woman 100mcg transdermal estradiol use treatment well tolerate . Subjects counsel regard lack contraceptive effect use estradiol patch . 3.3 Use Placebo All subject inform two-in-three chance receive estradiol patch one-in-three chance receive placebo patch . As well study medication , subject receive standard antipsychotic medication thus disadvantage way placement `` placebo '' group . Subjects enter trial relatively stable treatment regime change medication prior 30 day future change medication anticipate . By control variable , able create 'true placebo ' group modification antipsychotic medication trial period could potentially affect psychopathology result . Both subject researcher unaware group subject . However , need arise researcher able break code reveal group subject belongs . Subjects allocate placebo group offer open-label adjunctive treatment 200mcg estradiol two month proceed trial , thereby ensure participant receive potential benefit adjunctive estradiol . 3.4 Standard Antipsychotic Treatment As propose study adjunctive trial , participant continue receive standard antipsychotic treatment whilst trial . Antipsychotic medication measure `` risperidone equivalent '' , involve convert dose current antipsychotic treatment equivalent dose risperidone . To include trial participant must meet following criterion : 2-10mg daily `` risperidone equivalent '' least 4 week residual symptom define PANSS positive score great 15 and/or PANSS negative score great 15 . 3.5 Informed Consent Only participants able give inform consent , i.e . able demonstrate understand objective study implication role , recruit study . Involuntary patient able give inform consent able participate possible guardian relative contact notified patient ' involvement . Participants advise participation voluntary free withdraw study stage . 3.6 Confidentiality Participants ' identity remain anonymous time . Once participant agrees participate study , assign code number ensure anonymity . Information subject restrict researcher directly involve , unless clear management issue , case information share treatment team . Participants ' file store locked filing cabinet access available researcher project . All test result share participant family / guardian . 4 . METHOD 4.1 Participants A target number 180 participant ( 60 The Alfred , 60 Barwon 60 Dandenong ) recruit three-year period equal number allocate group ( 100mcg Estradiol n=60 ; 200mcg Estradiol n=60 ; Placebo n=60 ) . Participants recruit inpatient outpatient setting participant may recruit centre provide approval gain appropriate controlling body . The total number subject allow result analyse subgroup base factor menstrual cycle phase . 4.2 Materials - demographic information - diagnosis accord Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) - module L ( psychotic disorder ) D ( mania/hypomania ) - inclusion/exclusion criterion check - medical history &amp; non-invasive general physical examination - Laboratory test determine pregnancy status , menstrual cycle phase neuroendocrine status - Breast scan ( mammogram ; Alfred Dandenong site ) breast screen ( ultrasound ; Barwon site ) check breast abnormality participant conduct informed consent provide - hormone measurement estrogen , progesterone , prolactin , testosterone , LH , FSH DHEA - A menstrual cycle questionnaire ( MCQ ) gain menstrual history - Assessment psychopathology ( PANSS &amp; MADRS ) cognitive function ( RBANS ) Hormone assays repeat week 4 8 . A menstrual calendar use record onset cessation menses trial . The primary outcome measure Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , take week 1 , 2 , 4 8 trial . Cognitive test take place baseline 8 week . Side effect assess week 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 measure change subject 's reported side effect trial . 4.3 Procedures Participants screen soon identification possible ass eligibility entry study . The diagnostic instrument use Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( MINI ) . The detail project requirement participation explain eligible participant Plain Language Statement provide . If potential participant identify current client The Alfred Psychiatric Service , Southern Health ( Dandenong site ) Barwon Health ( Barwon site ) , researcher contact member individual 's treat team discus suitability approach client gain indication person 's ability give inform consent . A member treat team approach potential participant ask willing talk researcher study . This discussion involve provide detailed verbal explanation study write Participant Information Consent Form ( PI &amp; CF ) approve applicable Human Research Ethics Committee . The potential participant ask read PI &amp; CF read researcher . The potential participant encourage discus PI &amp; CF possibility participate study significant support person . Once potential participant read PI &amp; CF researcher another discussion person , preferably presence witness . The researcher ask potential participant provide verbal explanation think study involve participation . The researcher may draw attention particular part PI &amp; CF ensure potential participant fully aware aspect involve . The potential participant ask he/she question study , answer researcher . At point , researcher believe potential participant understand information provide study , opportunity ask question answer , consent form sign . The consent form sign date project participant , researcher explain project participant , witness . Participants provide inform , write consent undergo full psychiatric medical history receive non-invasive physical examination well breast scan screen ( dependant site specific regulatory advice ) . Baseline hormone level measure via blood test , menstrual cycle questionnaire administer determine menstrual status . Baseline psychopathology rating scale ( PANSS ) administer . After participant deem eligible enter trial baseline measurement perform , participant may randomise one three group duration eight-week double blind phase . The three group : ( 1 ) 100mcg estradiol patch , ( 2 ) 200mcg estradiol patch , ( 3 ) placebo patch . Upon entry double-blind phase , participant allocate identification number randomly assign treatment regimen generate The Alfred Clinical Trials Pharmacy , aware treatment group participant allocate directly involve trial . The Clinical Trials Pharmacy coordinator disclose randomisation code investigator data collector involve project . Day one trial first day participant receives study medication . Study medication dispense via pharmacy department site . Baseline measurement must take day first day trial , thus baseline consider Day 0 . Evaluation adverse event medication compliance perform regular interval duration trial . Psychopathology rating scale complete baseline week 1 , 2 , 4 8 . Hormone assays complete baseline week 4 8 . Cognitive assessment complete baseline week 8 . The week 8 visit must fall last day trial medication . 4.4 Clinical Follow-up For ethical reason , upon completion active phase trial participant `` unblinded '' make aware treatment receive . Participants receive placebo offer `` open label '' trial 200mg estradiol patch . This one disadvantage participation trial able take active medication wish . Participants opt `` open label '' trial estradiol patch monitor side effect 8 week whilst use patch . This data include research trial database . All participant follow 3 month follow completion active phase trial ( include open-label treatment ) . This follow-up consist monthly telephone contact check participant 's progress well determine duration `` antipsychotic effect '' estrogen . 5 .
