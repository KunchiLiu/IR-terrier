	<brief_summary>This study explore clinical hereditary ( genetic ) feature corneal dystrophy inherit corneal disease . Corneal dystrophy cloud cornea - transparent part eye cover iris pupil pass light back eye . When cornea become cloudy , interfere passage light , vision may impair lost . Corneal problem may occur vision problem alone , problem , change facial appearance bone joint problem . A good understanding genetic condition may help development well diagnostic test method disease management . Patients corneal dystrophy relate corneal disease family member may eligible study . Participants drawn patient enrolled study corneal dystrophy NEI collaborating clinic . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Medical surgical history - Verification diagnosis - Construction family tree regard familial vision problem - Complete eye examination , include dilation pupil photography cornea , test color vision , field vision , ability see dark , photograph eye . - Blood sample collection identify gene responsible corneal disease ascertain cause disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : This project , Clinical Molecular Studies Families With Corneal Dystrophy Other Inherited Corneal Diseases study inheritance corneal dystrophy inherit corneal disease , Mendelian complex order identify gene , mutate , cause corneal disease pathophysiology act . Study Population : Families many nationality ethnic background . We study maximum 2,000 patient family member . Design : The study consist ascertain individual , especially family multiple individual , affect corneal dystrophy inherit corneal disease . These patient family undergo detailed ophthalmological examination characterize corneal disease determine affectation status . A blood sample collect individual isolation DNA individual lymphoblastoid transformation establish renewable source DNA . Linkage analysis , physical mapping , mutational screening carry identify specific gene mutation associate corneal disease family . If necessary , gene product characterize biochemically . All associate investigator carry patient ascertainment , diagnosis , sample referral , case molecular genetic analysis . The study enroll subject NEI collaborate institution . Outcome Measures : Linkage determine use lod score method mutation specific gene assess use combination residue conservation , blosum score , molecular modeling . Biochemical , metabolic , physiological effect individualize specific assay .</detailed_description>
