	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Metastatic Cancer Unknown Primary</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Evaluate efficacy gemcitabine hydrochloride patient metastatic cancer unknown primary ( CUP ) , term improve quality life ( QOL ) ( measure FACT Physical Well Being subscale [ FACT-G ] ) reduction symptom distress ( measure Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale Short Form Global Distress Index [ MSAS-SF ] ) . - Define clinical benefit response use QOL instrument patient CUP receive gemcitabine hydrochloride . - Correlate objective and/or evaluable tumor response symptom QOL response patient . - Explore association symptom response , QOL response , clinical benefit response patient . - Evaluate change QOL patient symptom objective response treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride . - Correlate EuroQOL rating use symptom instrument ( MSAS-SF ) quality life instrument ( FACT-G ) . - Evaluate change perceive QOL , measure EuroQOL instrument , change relate symptom response QOL response . - Evaluate patient 's assessment treatment burden , measure single question , compare symptom response QOL response . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 , follow 1 week rest ( course 1 ) . For subsequent course , patient receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life ( QOL ) symptom response assess baseline week 8 , 16 , 32 ( end treatment ) . Questionnaires include Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale-Short Form , Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General , Pain Visual Analog Scale , EuroQOL . Patients ' perception symptom response perception treatment burden also assess . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 52 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
