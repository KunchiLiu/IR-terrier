	<brief_title>VeinViewer Peripheral IV Placement Children With Difficult Intravenous ( IV ) Access</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : Attempting get peripheral intravenous ( IV ) access one frustrating irksome task medical professional encounter . Many medical therapy require placement IV . In emergency situation , lifeline make difference good bad outcome . Determinants successful IV placement include skill expertise person place IV , vein person receives IV , luck . These difficulty often magnify child . Children small vein . Children come different size shape . Children often uncooperative . Not uncommonly , multiple attempt IV placement require success . The attempt need get IV place , pain anxiety child experience . Getting IV timely manner alter parental perception quality care improve parental satisfaction . Developing method improve success rate IV placement obvious benefit . During previous study , able demonstrate 25 % patient pediatric emergency department IV placement attempt fail first IV attempt . We able develop score system ( term DIVA score ) believe aid identify likely fail first IV attempt therefore may likely benefit intervention ( VeinViewer™ ) . By attempt demonstrate improve success increase likelihood failure first IV attempt , believe decrease number subject need show effect limit potentially resource intensive technique likely benefit . The VeinViewer™ infrared image system utilizes near-infrared light technology project real-time image location orientation ( 0.06mm ) vein onto surface patient 's skin . The VeinViewer™ receive FDA clearance August 2004 class I device . The VeinViewer 's Infrared Light consider harmless . We believe potential application VeinViewer™ improve success rate IV insertion Objectives : 1 . To investigate use VeinViewer™ improve success peripheral IV placement child difficult IV access ( DIVA score ≥ 3 ) . 2 . To validate DIVA ( difficult IV access ) score Hypothesis : 1 . The first stick success rate peripheral IV insertion child difficult IV access pediatric emergency department ( DIVA score ≥ 3 ) register nurse use VeinViewer™ guide technique well conventional method IV placement . 2 . The DIVA score valid scoring system identify likely fail first IV attempt . Methods : Study Design : Prospective randomized control trial . Randomization : Subjects randomize either get VeinViewer™ technique conventional method . Serially number seal opaque study packet block randomization create . Subjects : Inclusion criterion : - Presentation ED CHW - 0 19 year age - Requires peripheral IV determine examine physician - DIVA score ≥ 3 ( clinical scoring system identify difficult IV access give 2 point vein visible tourniquet , 2 vein palpable tourniquet , 1 age 1-2yo , 3 age &lt; 1 yo , 3 history prematurity ) - During time VeinViewer™ machine participate nurse available Exclusion criterion : - Central line available - Immunocompromised patient - Requirement immediate IV placement ( Patient 's condition would potentially compromised time delay IV placement . ) Patients present emergency department IV order screen inclusion study research assistant , nursing , investigator . A DIVA score determine . Those score ≥ 3 approached take part study . Informed parental consent obtain . Patient assent obtain child 7 year age old ) . Measurements : Predictor Variables : VeinViewer™ conventional method Main Outcome Variable : Success failure peripheral IV placement first attempt Secondary Outcome Variable : Number attempt successful IV placement Data collect ( potential modifier successful IV placement ) : - Age ( Date Birth ) - Number IV attempt success quit - Date visit - Location IV attempt - Weight - Reason IV ( Fluid , medication , ) - Height - Dermablend skin color category - History prematurity - Pre-attempt analgesia use - Vein visibility tourniquet - Vein palpability tourniquet - Technique use ( VeinViewer™/Conventional technique ) Conventional method : A tourniquet apply . The nurse identifies target vein visually tactilely one several area possible IV site ( dorsum hand , antecubital fossa , forearm ) . The area clean alcohol pad . The nurse insert 18-24 gauge IV needle/catheter look flashback . The tourniquet release . The IV flush . If IV flush well , IV secure usual manner . A secured flushed IV definition successful IV placement . VeinViewer™ technique : A tourniquet apply . Using VeinViewer™ nurse identifies vein cannulation . A tourniquet apply . The nurse attempt insert 18-24 gauge IV needle/catheter look flashback . The tourniquet release . The IV flush . If IV flush well , IV secure usual manner . A secured flushed IV definition successful IV placement . Subsequent Attempts : If unsuccessful first attempt IV placement , attempt another site technique ( VeinViewer™ guide conventional method ) perform . This repeat successful IV place physician decides give alternative therapy need IV access . We plan monitor success rate DIVA patient enrol study demonstrate comparable control group . Planned Analysis VeinViewer™ v Conventional method : The main outcome success failure peripheral IV placement first attempt ( dichotomous outcome ) . A Chi square test use compare proportion subject successful first stick IV placement use VeinViewer™ technique use conventional method 95 % confidence interval around difference . Also , plan look median number attempt place IV different method IV placement . We plan use non-parametric test like Wilcoxon Rank sum test . To test independent association VeinViewer™ technique conventional method IV placement success failure IV placement first attempt , multivariate logistic regression perform , potential confounding variable ( patient weight , diagnosis , etc ) include co-variates model . We plan use interaction term model take account may learn curve technique ( nurse early study vs. nurse later study ) . DIVA score validation : The patient whose information collect ( validation cohort ) study use validate DIVA score . We determine first attempt success rate conventional IV placement method DIVA score derivation cohort ( data previously collect derivation study ) validation cohort . We use chi-square statistic compare derivation validation cohort . The area receiver operate characteristic curve predict successful IV placement first attempt DIVA score compare derivation validation cohort . Attempts make refine score analysis demonstrate warrant . Estimated sample size calculation : From previous study , demonstrate patient DIVA score ≥ 3 45 % first attempt failure rate peripheral IV placement use conventional method . A technique improve success 25 % would consider significant . Using alpha 0.05 , beta 0.10 ( Power = 0.90 ) , make question two-tailed ; find estimated sample size group 85 . In word , 170 child DIVA ≥ 3 need study . Risk Subjects : There extra risk expect receive standard IV . The standard risk IV include bleed , bruising , pain , infection . The use VeinViewer™ technique may may take time place IV . If delay would detrimental subject 's care , ask take part study . Anticipated significance study : A technique improve first stick success rate decrease number stick require place IV would decrease amount pain , discomfort , anxiety patient . Getting IV timely manner alter parental perception quality care improve parental satisfaction . Also , may time saver nurse .</detailed_description>
