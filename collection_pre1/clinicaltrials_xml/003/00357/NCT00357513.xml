	<brief_summary>This study characterize gene response body 's immune inflammatory cell stroke . There wide variation stroke risk , stroke outcome , response clot-busting therapy stroke . This variation may due difference people 's response injury infection , difference genetic make-up individual . Genes store biological information determine body 's response injury infection . This study analyze activity large number gene try learn gene might relate patient outcome . This , turn , may lead understand gene profile relate increase stroke risk increase disability death . Healthy volunteer age 21 stroke patient age 21 admit NIH Stroke Program Suburban Hospital Bethesda , Md. , may eligible study . Volunteers screen medical history , blood pressure pulse measurement , electrocardiogram , neurological examination . Participants 20 35 milliliter ( ounce ) blood draw genetic study . The genetic material extract white blood cell analyze normal abnormal gene activity relate stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : In United States , stroke third common cause death lead cause adult disability . Despite many effort find effective treatment stroke present one acute stroke therapy . A major fact hinder stroke diagnosis treatment lack understand pathophysiology acute stroke . The advent new brain imaging technique allow identification pathophysiological insight . To date , however , lack genetic molecular information , part brain amenable biopsy unlike organ body . One new approach study process involve evolution stroke stroke recovery use gene chip technology . The attraction technology may allow differentiation neurological condition non-invasive peripheral blood sampling . Objectives : The objective study determine gene expression profile white blood cell use fingerprint different stroke subtypes outcome . Study Design : Microarrays examine loop design allow isolation gene effect confound variable analysis variance . Samples acquire 200 control volunteer 640 patient various stroke subtypes . The stroke patient sequential sample take time stroke stroke recovery . Individual gene up-regulation down-regulation defined univariate t-test comparison control population . These isolated gene effect compare use Hamming distance define global statistical difference graph analysis inter-structure distance . Outcome Measures : Groups gene significantly alter expression relation stroke compare control allow examination gene class activity potential stroke stroke recovery fingerprint .</detailed_description>
