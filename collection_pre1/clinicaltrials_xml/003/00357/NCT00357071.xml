	<brief_summary>This study collect blood sample patient non-infectious eye inflammatory diseases spectrum eye disorder produce sight-threatening vision loss . The blood analyze substance may provide good understanding nature disorder , possibly lead improve treatment . Treatment offer protocol . Patients 6 year age old eye inflammatory disease , include non-infectious uveitis , ocular cicatricial pemphigoid , non-infectious scleritis , episcleritis , Stevens Johnson syndrome , Moorens ulcer , peripheral ulcerative keratitis keratoconjunctivitis sicca , may eligible study . Patients may may currently participate treatment trial . Participants blood drawn needle arm vein . More sample may collect patient enrol another study schedule additional visit . No 4 teaspoonful blood collect one time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Responses Antigens Non-infectious Eye Inflammatory Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ocular inflammatory disease lead visual loss adult well child . These condition usually characterize repeated exacerbation remission . The underlying cause majority condition clear even though autoimmune mechanism implicate . Various study report altered immunological profile patient . An underlying immune mechanism think play role least ocular inflammatory disease . In addition , evidence literature also suggest inflammatory disease may important mechanism lead Age related macular degeneration Diabetic retinopathy , two leading cause vision loss . However , little known involvement immune component patient . This protocol propose test proliferative cell mediate humoral response self-antigens patient ocular inflammatory disease , AMD diabetic retinopathy . Patients recruit ongoing protocol . An attempt would make find correlation clinical disease immunological finding . These finding use diagnostic therapeutic purpose .</detailed_description>
