	<brief_summary>Most anti-HIV regimen include non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) ; however , individual fail regimen . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness protease inhibitor ( PI ) lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) HIV infected individual fail anti-HIV regimen include NNRTI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Standard effective antiretroviral therapy HIV infect individual include three-drug combination two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTIs ) either PI NNRTI . However , three-drug regimen may ideal resource-limited setting , viral load resistance testing may readily available . The purpose study evaluate safety efficacy PI LPV/r alone treatment-experienced , PI-naive HIV infected individual experience virologic failure three-drug regimen . This study last 104 week . All participant receive LPV/r twice daily 104 week . Participants experience virologic failure receive emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate daily addition LPV/r twice daily remainder study . There 16 study visit participant LPV/r monotherapy 12 study visit participant intensify LPV/r emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate . Blood collection clinical assessment occur visit ; urine collection resistance test occur select visit .</detailed_description>
