	<brief_summary>Pancreatitis cause acute injury pancreas . This illness associate abdominal pain , vomit even fever . We recently report high rate acute pancreatitis develop child undergo posterior spinal fusion scoliosis ( correct spinal curve ) . We show amount blood loss surgery relate incidence pancreatitis . In addition , marker monitor tissue injury elevate surgery significantly high patient develop acute pancreatitis later . We propose blood loss tissue injury could reduce , incidence pancreatits may less child . Therefore plan use drug Aprotinin . Aprotinin use reduce blood loss patient undergoing posterior spinal surgery , population propose study . If turns Aprotinin reduce blood loss or/and damage pancreas , thus pancreatitis , diminish pain discomfort , shorten hospital stay child . The result study guide medical care child future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Can Aprotinin Reduce Pancreatitis After Scoliosis Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We show association high intraoperative blood loss child young adult undergo posterior spinal fusion subsequent clinical course characterize high rate acute pancreatitis - rare illness child . Other complication include sepsis , deep wound infection , prolong length stay . Although reported child young adult idiopathic scoliosis show significantly high blood loss rate pancreatitis patient neuromuscular scoliosis , especially cerebral palsy . The purpose study assess efficacy Aprotinin , serine protease inhibitor , reduce intraoperative blood loss subsequent clinical pancreatitis associate complication patient cerebral palsy undergo posterior spinal fusion . Aprotinin currently approve use adult reduce major blood loss cardiac surgery , use child virtually major pediatric cardiac center . In population , blood loss consistently diminish 50 % . Safety efficacy adult child well document , use drug familiar anesthesiologist . In addition , show reduce blood loss effectively large controlled-studies adult undergo major orthopedic surgery , include spinal fusion . Recently one publish study also suggest Aprotinin may reduce blood loss child undergo idiopathic scoliosis surgery , study adequately statistical power due small sample size . Since intraoperative blood loss cytokine elevation significantly correlate incidence acute pancreatitis , hypothesize major role ischemic injury development pancreatitis complication . We expect Aprotinin reduce blood loss prevent ischemic injury hence , decrease incidence acute pancreatitis child young adult . While safety efficacy establish cardiac surgery adult child , propose conduct double-blind , randomize trial Aprotinin child cerebral palsy undergo posterior spinal fusion surgery answer follow specific question . Specific Aim 1 : To assess whether intraoperative Aprotinin infusion reduce intraoperative blood loss , whether lower incidence postoperative pancreatitis associate complication sepsis , wound infection prolong length stay . Specific Aim 2 : To assess indirect method whether Aprotinin infusion alter degree ischemic injury concomitantly reduction blood loss incidence postoperative pancreatitis .</detailed_description>
