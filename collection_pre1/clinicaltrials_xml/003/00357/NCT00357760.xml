	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine effect two different dos AVE0005 ( vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] Trap [ ziv-aflibercept ] ) treatment progression-free proportion 8 week patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma previous treatment tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect AVE0005 ( VEGF Trap ) treatment objective response rate patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma previous TKI treatment . II . To describe progression-free survival among patient undergo dose escalation follow progression low-dose AVE0005 ( VEGF Trap ) . III . To evaluate safety tolerability AVE0005 ( VEGF Trap ) patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma previous treatment TKI . OTHER PRE-SPECIFIED OBJECTIVES : I . To determine circulating level VEGF AVE0005 ( VEGF-Trap ) complex correlate clinical activity . II . To evaluate modulation specific angiogenesis-related protein expression AVE0005 ( VEGF Trap ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A ( Higher dose VEGF Trap ) : Patients receive high dose ziv-aflibercept intervenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 . ARM B ( Lower dose VEGF Trap ) : Patients receive low dose ziv-aflibercept IV 1 hour day 1 . In arm , course repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive treatment Arm B may crossover receive treatment Arm A time disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
