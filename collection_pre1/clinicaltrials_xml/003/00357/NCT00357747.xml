	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . AEG35156 may help docetaxel work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose AEG35156 give together docetaxel treat patient solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose define recommend phase II dose AEG35156 combination docetaxel patient solid tumor . Secondary - Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity AEG35156 docetaxel define duration reversibility toxicity . - Determine pharmacokinetic profile regimen . - Assess , preliminarily , antitumor activity regimen patient measurable disease . - Assess pharmacodynamic effect AEG35156 administration X-linked inhibitor apoptosis protein ( XIAP ) level apoptosis peripheral blood mononuclear cell , select patient , tumor tissue . - Evaluate M30/M65 cytokeratin 18 level , marker apoptosis/necrosis epithelial tumor , patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study AEG35156 . Patients receive AEG35156 IV continuously day -2 -1 . Patients receive AEG35156 IV continuously 24 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Beginning course 2 , patient also receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos AEG35156 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Blood collect baseline periodically study treatment pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic assessment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
