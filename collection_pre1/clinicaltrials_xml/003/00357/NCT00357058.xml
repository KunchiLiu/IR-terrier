	<brief_summary>This study examine role different brain region tactile ( touch ) ability application tourniquet ( inflated blood pressure cuff ) . When forearm deprive blood short period time , tactile ability hand improve . This study try learn cause improvement . Healthy normal volunteer eligible study . Candidates brief medical history physical examination . Volunteers undergo two experiment , describe , involve follow procedure : - Ischemic nerve block - A blood pressure cuff inflate 35-40 minute around elbow area ( also around calf Experiment 2 - see ) . The result numbness , tingle , loss muscle strength , discoloration forearm hand disappear within minute cuff deflate . - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) - This test use magnetic field radio wave instead X-rays produce image brain structure function . The volunteer lie stretcher move scanner ( cylinder contain strong magnet ) , wear earplug protect ear loud thump noise occur electrical switching radio frequency circuit . The subject communicate investigator intercom time scan . - Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) - An insulated wire coil place patient 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse travel scalp skull cause small electrical current outer part brain . The stimulation may cause muscle hand arm twitching transient tingle forearm , head face muscle . - Tactile spatial acuity test - The subject 's left arm place cast leave index finger immobilize test involve identify direction groove apply finger . Experiment 1 This experiment measure change tactile acuity brain activation follow cuff inflation . The subject lie MRI scanner , leave arm immobilized . Tactile acuity measure repetitively left index finger placement inflation pressure cuff around right forearm . The experiment consist two session cuff around forearm one cuff around calf last 90 minute 2 hour . Experiment 2 This experiment measure change tactile acuity link TMS stimulation . The subject sits armchair leave arm immobilized . Tactile acuity measure repetitively left index finger placement inflation pressure cuff around right forearm . In addition , TMS pulse ( one pulse per second ) deliver different location right side head 30 minute . The experiment consist 10 separate session different day , last 1 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute deafferentation one hand lead improvement tactile discriminative skill , non-deafferented hand . This phenomenon , recently identify laboratory , represent adaptive , behaviorally important consequence deafferentation . It demonstrate acute loss sensory input one hand result rapid improvement skill remain hand . The first experiment protocol seek identify cortical region activate association improvement tactile spatial acuity . In second experiment , determine effect transient inactivation focal cortical region behavioral gain . While first experiment characterize brain region activate association performance improvement , second experiment provide information functional role region . Understanding substrate mediate behavioral gain may important design strategy enhance .</detailed_description>
