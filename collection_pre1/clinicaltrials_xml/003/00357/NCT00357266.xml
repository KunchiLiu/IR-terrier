	<brief_summary>This study examine blood cell tissue sample people uveitis ( eye inflammation ) try gain well understanding condition . It look 1 ) difference cell uveitis active control ; 2 ) gene control function cell different stage condition ; 3 ) proteins cell make different stage . Patients 6 year age old eye inflammation least 8 week ' duration may eligible study . They must currently enrol another NEI protocol evaluation treatment uveitis . Participants provide blood possibly eye tissue sample follow : Blood sample : Blood sample draw , probably arm vein , period inflammation bad quiet . No 60 mL ( 4 tablespoon ) draw visit , eight sample collect 1 year . Tissue sample : For patient require eye surgery , sample tissue fluid remove routine part surgery may provide investigator study research purpose . Samples collect patient ' visit schedule part protocol . The sample label special code number preserve patient 's identity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ocular inflammatory disease , include uveitis , cause significant visual loss . Previous non-human investigation identify several cell type , receptor system metabolic intermediate lead treatment approach human patient . However , information human genetic expression step define inflammatory disease state lack . This non-intervention study propose obtain peripheral blood tissue specimens patient enrolled intramural trial ocular inflammatory disease apply contemporary cDNA microarray technology analysis differential gene expression . Test result report participant use diagnostic therapeutic purpose . The study 's primary objective identify unique gene expression profile well disease relevant gene patient ocular inflammatory disease define clinical stage use cDNA microarray analysis . This help provide insight understand pathological mechanism potential target treatment . Some 3,000-5,000 gene examine start select set associate interleukin ( IL ) proteins receptor , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) . Purified peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( whole blood lysates use RNA isolation procedure ) use isolate total RNA sample . Samples take period active recur inflammatory disease period quiescence treatment . The microarray tool method genetic analysis available NEI collaborate NIA laboratory . A secondary objective analyze circulate protein profile serum available tissue fluid specimens patient ocular inflammatory disease time point describe . These sample analyze use 2-dimensional SDS-PAGE profile proteomic difference patient define clinical stage . In-gel digestion subsequent sequence analysis mass spectroscopy perform differentially express protein ( ) interest identify . Other method flow cytometry analysis proliferation assay use purify PBMCs use examine expression status cell surface marker interest ( e.g. , CD25 ) well response antigen mitogen peak trough serum concentration daclizumab therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Participant 6 year age . 2 . Participant diagnosis ocular inflammatory disease least eight week ' duration prior enrollment , require medical treatment control ocular inflammation . This treatment must require use corticosteroid ( e.g. , prednisone equivalent ) investigational treatment , combination two antiinflammatory treatment , include example prednisone , cyclophosphamide , cyclosporine , azathioprine , mycophenolate mofetil , methotrexate , etc . Participants anticipate , restrict , follow condition : scleritis , intermediate posterior uveitis , intermediate uveitis par planitis subtype , sarcoidosis , VogtKoyanagiHarada ( VKH ) syndrome , Behcet 's disease , juvenile rheumatoid arthritis ( JRA ) , retinal vasculitis sympathetic ophthalmia . 3 . Participant currently enrol another NEI protocol one ( relate ) condition require periodic visit NIH treatment and/or evaluation . 4 . Participant able understand sign inform consent ( applicable assent ) participant young age 18 enrollment , parent legal guardian able understand sign consent form behalf . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Participant age 6 year . 2 . Participant inadequate vascular access obtain routine venous peripheral whole blood specimen total 50 mL single visit . 3 . Participants inadequate peripheral leukocyte count would unlikely provide adequate RNA sample . For purpose , total leukocyte count 3 x 10 ( 9 ) /L exclude participant enrollment . Unless recognize medical condition likely reduce leukocyte count , blood count prior visit 5 week earlier may use determine eligibility first subsequent sample collection . ( A participant initially enroll adequate leukocyte count may remain enrolled count subsequently fall limit , blood sample draw protocol leukocyte count recovers limit ) .</criteria>
