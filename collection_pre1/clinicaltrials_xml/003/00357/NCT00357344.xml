	<brief_summary>This study evaluate large , intentional weight reduction affect human brain possible way reverse change associate excess body weight . Subtle change brain region occur people overweight . Such change may involve regulation eat behavior , though clear whether change present weight gain consequence . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use study local structure brain . Patients age 18 45 undergoing gastric bypass surgery pregnant breastfeeding may eligible study . A study group lean participant serve control . Patients visit Phoenix Indian Medical Center 3 day time test . They medical examination , electrocardiogram , test blood urine . Questionnaires complete involve patient ' mood possible influence eat behavior , well food preference . A taste test , smell test , assessment decision-making process conduct . An oral glucose tolerance test involve needle place intravenously ( IV ) arm , draw blood patient drink sugar solution . The test take 3-1/2 hour , six blood sample take ( 2 tablespoon total ) . A meal test also include use IV line . After patient consume liquid meal , blood collect analyze level blood sugar hormone . For DEXA scan , measure body composition , patient lie still low-dose X-rays use 5 10 minute . Urine collect 1 whole day , measure cortisol , hormone . The MRI scan us strong magnetic field obtain image body organ tissue . Patients metal body may interfere scan machine test . For MRI procedure , patient lie table slide enclose tunnel scanner ask lie still . Patients able communicate MRI staff time scan , may ask remove machine time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Effects From Gastric Bypass Weight Loss Brain Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : We identify subtle change brain region obese subject use new computerize technique ( voxel-based morphometry , VBM ) allow study local structure brain take detailed picture brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) processing image sophisticate statistical software . Some region may interfere obese person 's ability predict future consequence eat behavior . These change may explain people difficulty lose weight . However , clear whether change brain present consequence weight gain . OBJECTIVES : The main aim study evaluate effect large intentional weight reduction brain obese individual assess possible reversal change associate excess body weight . Additional objective ) determine possible behavioral correlate change brain tissue composition associate large intentional weight reduction b ) confirm result previous exploratory analysis show human obesity associate change brain structure area relate regulation eat behavior . DESIGN : This longitudinal protocol mainly focus obese patient undergo roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGBP ) , represent effective approach currently available achieve substantial weight loss , thus maximize chance detect significant change brain tissue composition . Therefore , propose study brain morphology metabolic behavioral characteristic 40 obese patient undergo RYGBP prior 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 month surgery . Forty lean subject ( 0 , 12 , 24 , 48 month ) also study comparison . OUTCOME MEASURES : The volume different component brain VBM MRI picture ; metabolic parameter relevant relationship obesity brain measure fasting concentration postprandial response metabolite ; ability regulate reward behavior specific task questionnaire ; ability detect discriminate smell olfaction test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Ethnicity : Caucasian , due crosssectional analysis , upon present longitudinal study base , make Caucasian subject lack normative data racial ethnic group Age 1845 year , minimize confound role wellknown effect age brain tissue composition . There , fact , compel evidence post mortem vivo study brain shrink age . Neuropathological CT MRI morphometric study indicate age predominantly substantially affect GM . In addition , deep WM lesion see MRIs approximately onethird asymptomatic elderly subject . Blood pressure also rise increase age affect brain morphology . Several study provide evidence specific pattern structural brain correlate age , globally , GM WM compartment , also locally , within region brain . Therefore , limit confound effect age brain tissue composition , could theoretically overlap confound weight loss , age limit enter study 45 year . BMI great equal 35 kg/m ( 2 ) group 1 less 25 kg/m ( 2 ) group 2 . Weight le equal 150 kg ( maximum weight allow MRI scan table manufacturer ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA History clinical manifestation : Current smoking Type 2 diabetes ( accord World Health Organization diagnostic criterion ( 63 ) ) Endocrine disorder , Cushing 's disease , pituitary disorder , hypo hyperthyroidism Pulmonary disorder , include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease would limit ability follow protocol ( investigator judgment ) obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ; subject mild exerciseinduced asthma medication betaadrenergic agonist ( albuterol ) allow enter study Cardiovascular disease , include coronary heart disease , heart failure , arrhythmia , peripheral artery disease Hypertension , diagnose treat outside physician sit blood pressure measurement , use appropriate cuff , high 140/90 mmHg two occasion Gastrointestinal disease , include inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis ) , malabsorption syndrome ( e.g . celiac disease ) , gastric ulcer ( active ) ; subject gastroesophageal reflux allow enter study Liver disease , include cirrhosis , active hepatitis B C , AST ALT great equal 3x normal Renal disease , define serum creatinine concentration great equal 1.5 mg/dl and/or proteinuria great 300 mg/day ( 200 microgram/min ) Central nervous system disease , include previous history cerebrovascular accident , dementia , neurodegenerative disorder Cancer require treatment past five year , except nonmelanoma skin cancer cancer clearly cured opinion investigator carry excellent prognosis ( e.g. , Stage 1 cervical cancer ) Conditions specifically mention may serve criterion exclusion discretion investigator Personal and/or family history major psychiatric disorder base upon DSMIV ( 64 ) , include depression , schizophrenia , psychosis , may affect brain tissue composition independent obesity . Medications act central nervous system steroidal drug within 2 month baseline study . Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAID ) , proton pump inhibitor , antiacid allow discontinue 3 day admission . Alcohol and/or drug abuse ( 3 drink per day use drug , amphetamine , cocaine , heroin , marijuana ) . Contraindications MRI , include pacemaker and/or ferromagnetic implant claustrophobia . Pregnancy lactation . All subject fully inform aim , nature , risk study prior give write informed consent .</criteria>
