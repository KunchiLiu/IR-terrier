	<brief_summary>This study continue evaluate safety use intravenous dos Replagal two patient Fabry disease . Fabry disease genetic disorder inherit X-linked recessive trait . It cause deficiency enzyme alpha galactosidase , normally break lipid , fatty substance call ceramidetrihexoside , build block cell body . The deficiency break lipid eventually cause lipid accumulate injure cell . Vascular , renal , neurological problem result . It know exactly lipid accumulation bring problem , study another lipid storage disorder . Two patient 7 17 year age Fabry disease receive intravenous infusion Replagal dose 0.2 mg/kg body weight every 2 week may eligible study . Participants undergo follow test procedure : - Physical examination . - Neurological examination . - Medical medication history . - Vital sign . - Assessment height weight . - Blood test determine complete blood count chemistry . - Electrocardiogram . - Doppler blood flow study . Participants go baseline evaluation , period 1 day . They receive intravenous infusion Replagal every week , dose 0.2 mg/kg body weight . Vital sign measure infusion immediately 1 hour afterward . There careful monitoring allergic reaction side effect . The infusion time take approximately 40 minute . This study last least 1 year , sponsor investigate drug manufacturer decide withdraw support study .</brief_summary>
