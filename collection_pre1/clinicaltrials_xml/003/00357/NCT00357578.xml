	<brief_summary>This study examine skin blood cell genetic change relate development age-related macular degeneration , eye disease significantly impair ability read , drive , carry daily activity . It common cause vision loss people age 50 . People age-related macular degeneration healthy normal volunteer age 50 year old may eligible study . Candidates undergo medical history , physical examination eye examination dilation pupil . Photographs eye take special camera . Study participant blood drawn three time ( 6 tablespoon time ) undergo three skin biopsy . For skin biopsy , anesthetic inject skin small piece skin-approximately 1/4-inch cube-is remove . The blood draw biopsy do 7- 10-day interval . In case , single biopsy do visit , may necessary take-at most-one additional biopsy arm visit . Patients return one follow-up visit 7 10 day last biopsy examination biopsy site removal stitch . The result study may provide investigator information need develop new mean diagnose treat age-related macular degeneration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) represent common cause blindness patient age 50 . While hereditary environmental factor appear play role pathogenesis disease , common genetic mutation identify . This pilot study intend test feasibility evaluate pattern expression gene may involve pathogenesis AMD . The gene interest involve process wound repair , cell injury cell death . We hope access expression gene , tissue take non-ocular site , patient AMD patient without AMD . Biopsied skin fibroblast circulate monocyte 62 patient obtain ; 14 without AMD , 14 least one large ( great 125 micron ) druse , geographic atrophy and/or choroidal neovascularization AMD , 10 geographic atrophy , 20 choroidal neovascularization and/or disciform scar . The gene expression pattern tissue examine various technique include polymerase chain reaction , Northern blot analysis , differential display microarray technology . The genetic expression pattern patient AMD compare age-matched control subject . The primary outcome determine feasibility obtain skin monocyte sample patient AMD , extract RNA sample , study gene expression pattern . This study provide investigator information need develop subsequent study potential diagnostic test .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : INCLUSION CRITERIA 1 THROUGH 3 APPLY TO THE FIRST TWELVE PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED . INCLUSION CRITERIA 4 THROUGH 6 APPLY TO THE LAST 50 PARTICIPANTS ENROLLED . 1 . AMD Patients : Diagnosis AMD define presence least one druse great 125 micron diameter ( 4 patient ) geographic atrophy least one eye choroidal neovascularization drusen size least one eye ( 4 patient ) . ( AMD case ) 2 . Age 60 year old . 3 . Agematched control patient , absence drusen 5 drusen less 63 micron , absence diagnostic criterion AMD , age 60 year old . The distribution age control group similar possible distribution age disease group ( 4 patient ) . 4 . AMD Patients : Diagnosis AMD define presence least one druse great 125 micron diameter ( 10 patient ) , geographic atrophy ( 10 patient ) choroidal neovascularization drusen size least one eye and/or disciform scar ( 20 patient ) . ( AMD case ) Presence neovascularization disciform scar formation verify color photography . 5 . Age 50 year old . 6 . Agematched control patient : absence drusen 5 drusen less 63 micron , absence diagnostic criterion AMD , age 50 year old . The distribution age control group . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patient age le 50 year . Presence retinal disease involve photoreceptors and/or out retinal layer AMD loss high myopia , retinal dystrophy , central serous retinopathy , vein occlusion , diabetic retinopathy uveitis similar outer retinal disease present prior age 50 . Opacities ocular medium , limitation pupillary dilation problem sufficient preclude adequate stereo fundus photography . Medical problem make consistent followup treatment period unlikely ( e.g. , stroke , severe MI , terminal carcinoma ) . Inability inaccessibility obtain dermal biopsy inner aspect arm due previous trauma , underlie skin disorder would preclude good wound healing , previous surgery arm breast could prevent good wound heal induce change biopsy site .</criteria>
