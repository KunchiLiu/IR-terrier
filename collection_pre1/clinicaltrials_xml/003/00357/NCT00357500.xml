	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , etoposide cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Thalidomide , celecoxib , fenofibrate may stop growth cancer cell block blood flow cancer . Celecoxib also may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving combination chemotherapy together thalidomide , celecoxib , fenofibrate may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give etoposide cyclophosphamide together thalidomide , celecoxib , fenofibrate work treat young patient relapse progressive cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate activity etoposide , cyclophosphamide , thalidomide , celecoxib , fenofibrate , term prolong time disease progression , young patient relapse progressive cancer . Secondary - Determine , preliminarily , biologic activity regimen , term tumor response overall survival , patient . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Evaluate different radiographic technique marker tumor response patient . - Evaluate predictive ability vitro correlative study marker tumor response . STATISTICAL DESIGN : Patients classify one 8 stratum accord diagnosis : leukemia/lymphoma , bone tumor , neuroblastoma , high grade glial tumor , low grade glial tumor , ependymoma , medulloblastoma/PNET , miscellaneous . A two-stage design disease stratum plan . The accrual goal end two-stage design 20 subject stratum . A stopping rule apply accrual first 10 eligible subject enrol disease stratum . If 1 patient first 10 evaluable patient alive progression-free 27 week tolerate therapy accrual stage two would proceed . Among 20 patient within stratum , 3 patient meet primary endpoint regimen would consider successful . The probability conclude treatment feasible 0.95 true success rate 30 % 0.07 true succes rate 5 % . Overall accrual target 80-160 patient . Please see publish manuscript ( Robison et al Pediatr Blood Cancer 2014 ) result within disease stratum .</detailed_description>
