	<brief_summary>The aim study compare safety , specificity , sensitivity ease procedure two potential diagnostic assay HSV-1 detection cornea . Through use new diagnostic assay , correct early intervention would reduce corneal scar HSK , would also allow initiation appropriate treatment HSV mimicking keratitis . HSV-1 infection eye result corneal scar blindness . Early diagnosis condition appropriate treatment utmost importance . Various ocular surface condition mimic herpetic keratitis clinical presentation result diagnostic confusion . Inappropriate delay treatment herpetic corneal disease result increase morbidity . In UK present clinical presentation mainstay diagnosis . Unfortunately case often present inexperienced clinical staff result variability diagnostic acumen . This often result delay inappropriate diagnosis herpetic keratitis . Laboratory technique presently available aid diagnosis infrequently use clinical practice . There various reason lack use . Historically viral culture technique mainstay investigation slow , require week provide result . PCR replace culture technique relatively quick , reliable sensitive . Many clinician within UK still fully inform advance therefore utilize technique supplement clinical diagnosis . We propose investigate use topically applied fluorescent antibody active replicate HSV-1 droplet form real time PCR detection virus . If successful increase potential diagnostic capability GPs less experienced health care worker . Such test reduce variability diagnosis dependency experience ophthalmologist diagnose condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Efficacy Two Potential Diagnostic Assays Herpes Simplex Keratitis ( HSK )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Strategy Patients attend Ophthalmology department , fulfil criterion outline patient recruitment criterion , ask write consent volunteer study . Tears remove store sterile label eppendorf -70 degree C analysis . An impression cytology sample take inflamed cornea store viral transport medium send regional virology laboratory , Belfast extraction storage procedure . Blood sample take store appropriately paired 3 month sample available antibody test . Monoclonal antibody apply vivo diagnosis HSK outline view use vivo confocal microscope . Photographic evidence result record patient . Data nest real time PCR analysis monoclonal antibody test record separately different individual patient study progress . Patient record also update result tear blood test study progress . Recruitment Potential : Over 200 eye patient RVH Belfast , 300 patient Bedford 600 patient BMEC Birmingham treat year topical acyclovir suspect HSV-1 infection . The number patient treat within community GPs would significantly increase number . The vast majority patient never laboratory confirmation herpetic infection . The patient throughput hospital year enable adequate recruitment study three year period . This ensure study entirely viable perspective patient number . Patient number need viable study At present unable perform statistical power calculation , aware sensitivity either two propose diagnostic assay . Previous work Kaye SB20. , et al suggest PCR technique sensitivity 82 % use human cornea ) . In contrast , PCR technique use much superior sensitivity due use real time analysis nest methodology use . These test compare clinical diagnosis experience consultant ophthalmologist . We accept need statistical power calculation order calculate recruitment level need valid study . We therefore carry initial study use diagnostic assay 50 patient result use perform power calculation use sample size method one-sided equivalence sensitivity base upon McNemar test21 ensure adequate number recruit . In addition , hope recruit ( 20 % required number ) allow patient dropout study . Patient Recruitment Criteria Patients age 16 year cause keratitis difficult diagnose HSK exclude enrol study . Immunosuppressed patient include patient treated systemic steroid exclude . All patient ask verbal write consent . All patient continue follow accord clinical requirement . In addition routine assessment additional clinical categorisation attend consultant patient think ( ) , ( b ) , clinical evidence keep herpetic infection record . In vivo immunofluorescence diagnostic procedure 30 microlitres fluorescent-labelled mAB ( 2mg/ml ) , ( mAB use previous study Sharma A. , et al7 ) normal saline solution apply eye . After 20 minute unbound antibody rinse away saline solution . The eye view slit lamp vivo confocal microscope available . mAB penetration layer cornea record . In addition , evidence stromal inflammation record relationship specific fluorescence note . This indicate contribution active herpetic infection ( specific fluorescence either epithelium , stroma ) causative effect rather immunological response latent virus . Comparison vivo result nest real time PCR technique Impression cytology carry , prior application antibody , confirm presence/absence viral antigen use nested real time PCR analysis . The potential amplicon contamination associate nucleic acid amplification test use well recognised make mandatory use ( ) separate , designate work station ( b ) uni-directional work-flow specimen preparation amplify product analysis ; model operation standard regional virology laboratory . All PCR experiment therefore carry supervision Dr. Hugh O'Neill Regional Virology Laboratory , RVH , Belfast . Impression cytology sample send laboratory viral transport medium . Each specimen vortexed 15 second receipt laboratory resuspend cellular content . A volume remove PCR remainder store . Nested PCR undertaken use primer recognise HSV-1 gpD gene ( HSV-1 outer product 221 184 base pair ( bp ) inner product 138 101 bp respectively ) . Hot-start PCR perform Perkin Elmer GeneAmp 2400 thermal cycler 10 μl specimen plus 40 μl mix subject 35 first round cycle . One microlitre product transfer 49μl second round mix 25 second round cycle . Impression cytology sample take non-inflamed eye recruit history herpetic eye infection use know negative sample . A positive HSV control distil water negative control also include run . First second round product visualise together ethidium bromide-stained 2 % agarose gel photograph ( Polaroid ) . Appropriately sized band present second round , present first second round , record positive strong positive respectively . All positive specimen re-tested . Laboratory staff responsible PCR test aware result vivo antibody test . Comparison make sensitivity specificity monoclonal antibody vivo assay nest real time PCR diagnosis . Investigating effect mAB ocular surface inflammatory milieu Analysis general cytokine profile also assess monitor cytokine profile tear two different time point : prior monoclonal antibody treatment 30 minute application antibody . Cytokine profile tear analyse use proteomics protein biochip ( RANDOX Labs . Ltd. ) capable simultaneous quantitative detection array pro- anti- inflammatory cytokine . Tear sample patient suspect active herpetic infection receive antibody serve control . Such analysis allow statement make regard potential inflammatory/immunological reaction monoclonal antibody . Investigating potential systemic immunological reaction mouse mAB Ten millilitre clot blood take prior application monoclonal antibody test presence pre-existing antibody . In addition , 3 month check 10 millilitre blood take analysed antibody may form three month interface application monoclonal cornea . The avascular cornea think immunologically privilege site , make potential immune response antibody less likely .</detailed_description>
