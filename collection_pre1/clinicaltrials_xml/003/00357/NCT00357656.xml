	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare hemostatic efficacy safety continuous infusion versus intermittent bolus infusion peri- post-operative setting , employ rAHF-PFM , recombinant antihemophilic factor manufacture without add human animal protein , previously treat patient severe moderately severe hemophilia A ( baseline factor VIII level &lt; = 2 % normal ) undergo unilateral major orthopedic surgery require drain placement . The total study period per subject ( consent study completion ) vary approximately 9 26 week involve clinical laboratory assessment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The subject subject 's legally authorize representative provide sign informed consent . The subject within 18 70 year age . The subject severe moderately severe hemophilia A , defined baseline factor VIII level &lt; = 2 % normal , test screening . A subset 15 subject per group must baseline factor VIII level &lt; 1 % normal . The aPTT must within range normal administration FVIII concentrate , determine preoperative pharmacokinetic evaluation , document medical history , available . The subject schedule undergo elective unilateral major orthopedic surgery require drain placement . The subject previously treat factor VIII concentrate ( ) minimum least 150 exposure day ( estimate investigator ) prior study entry . Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive subject must immunocompetent determined CD4 count &gt; = 200 cells/mm³ ( CD4 count screen ) , HIV negative subject CD4 count &lt; 200 cells/mm³ qualify , immunocompetency document . The subject life expectancy least 28 day day surgery . The subject detectable factor VIII inhibitor screening , titer &gt; = 0.4 BU ( Nijmegen modification Bethesda assay ) central laboratory . The subject history factor VIII inhibitor titer &gt; = 0.4 BU ( Nijmegen assay ) &gt; = 0.5 BU ( Bethesda assay ) time prior screening . The subject schedule undergo concurrent minor major surgery course study . The placement central venous line performance fine needle aspiration biopsy permit . Excluding hemophiliarelated physical impairment , subject assign NYHA class &gt; = III accord New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) . The subject abnormal renal function ( serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL ) . The subject active hepatic disease ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] level &gt; 5 time upper limit normal ) . The subject severe chronic liver disease evidence , limited , follow : International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) &gt; 1.4 , hypoalbuminemia , portal vein hypertension include presence otherwise unexplained splenomegaly history esophageal varix . The subject clinical and/or laboratory evidence abnormal hemostasis cause hemophilia A ( e.g. , latestage chronic liver disease , immune thrombocytopenia purpura ) . The subject currently receive , schedule receive course study , immunomodulating drug antiretroviral chemotherapy ( e.g. , alphainterferon , corticosteroid agent dose equivalent hydrocortisone great 10 mg/day ) . The subject know hypersensitivity mouse hamster protein . The subject receive another investigational drug study within 30 day prior screen and/or schedule receive additional investigational drug course trial context another investigational study . The subject identify investigator unable unwilling cooperate study procedure .</criteria>
