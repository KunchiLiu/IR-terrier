	<brief_title>PXD101 Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient acute myeloid leukemia treat PXD101 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate overall survival patient . II . Evaluate duration response patient . III . Evaluate toxicity drug patient . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate molecular response PXD101 . OUTLINE : Patients receive PXD101 IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6-12 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood bone marrow sample obtain study treatment laboratory study . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 1 year .</detailed_description>
