	<brief_title>Weaning From Mechanical Ventilation Using Permissive Hypercarbia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective research ass utility permissive hypercarbia ( PH ) wean patient risk factor difficult wean mechanical ventilation . This pilot study seek validate concept PH significantly improve ability patient wean mechanical ventilation change approach physician take ventilator wean many patient . Null Hypothesis : Patients PH wean mechanical ventilation rapidly receive PH . Patients significant lung disease fail wean mechanical ventilation either result inability oxygenate blood adequately remove carbon dioxide . This result longer Intensive Care Unit stay increase morbidity mortality patient prolong period mechanical ventilation . This study focus patient failure adequately remove carbon dioxide ( ventilatory failure ) endeavor evaluate method enhance carbon dioxide elimination alter acid-base status patient utilize permissive hypercarbia ( PH ) . PH use specifically wean mechanical ventilation enhance carbon dioxide elimination period . PH use intensivists purpose critically evaluate clinical study . Mechanical ventilation use PH maintains increase CO2 either partial complete metabolic compensation . Therefore , blood pH either normal slightly reduce . In patient adequately sedate , reduce pH well tolerate without respiratory distress air hunger . However , PH use awake patient propose , full metabolic compensation would require avoid air hunger wean ventilator support . The metabolic compensation produce either result renal compensation , typically ICU setting , iatrogenically . Metabolic alkalosis produce administration alkalinize agent result gastric suction contraction alkalosis result use diuretic . PH enhance CO2 elimination increase concentration CO2 exhale gas . The pulmonary capillary pCO2 elevate therefore alveolar CO2 exhale end-tidal CO2 . Thus CO2 exhale equal volume exhale gas . This increase CO2 concentration reduces minute ventilation require exhale CO2 produce patient . PH decrease minute ventilation requirement even patient increase dead space facilitate wean patient mechanical ventilation mechanism describe .</detailed_description>
