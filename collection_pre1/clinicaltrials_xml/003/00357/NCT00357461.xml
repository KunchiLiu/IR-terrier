	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Vaccines make gp100 peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving ipilimumab together vaccine therapy may effective treatment melanoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study ipilimumab vaccine therapy see well work compare ipilimumab alone treat patient previously treat stage IV melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ipilimumab With Without Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Previously Treated Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare impact ipilimumab v without gp100 peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 clinical response patient previously treat , HLA-A*0201 positive stage IV melanoma . Secondary - Compare safety/toxicity profile regimens patient . - Determine immunologic response , measure vitro assay use peripheral blood sample , patient treat regimen . - Determine response rate re-induction regimen patient relapse initial response . - Determine overall survival . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label study . Patients stratify accord ECOG performance status ( 0 vs 1 2 ) metastasis ( M1a v M1 b M1c ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Induction phase : - Arm I : Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive ipilimumab arm I . Patients also receive gp100 peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve stable disease well 12 week 4 course proceed maintenance phase . - Maintenance phase : - Arm I : Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive ipilimumab IV arm I gp100 peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 SC day 1 . Treatment arm begin approximately week 21 repeat every 3 month 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients relapse progress maintenance phase undergo re-induction comprise 4 course treatment ipilimumab without gp100 peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 induction phase . Patients achieve respond disease ( complete response , partial response , stable disease ) 12 week re-induction proceed maintenance phase 8 course treatment . After completion study treatment , patient evaluate 3 week last treatment , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 94 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
