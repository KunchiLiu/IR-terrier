	<brief_summary>Acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) severe lung condition cause respiratory failure . Individuals ARDS often require use artificial breathing machine , know mechanical ventilator . High frequency oscillatory ventilation ( HFOV ) form mechanical ventilation pump small amount air lung constant high rate . The purpose study compare safety efficacy two HFOV method individual ARDS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Methods High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation Individuals With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ARDS serious condition involve lung inflammation fluid accumulation air sac , lead low blood oxygen level respiratory failure . It often fatal affect approximately 160,000 individual year United States . The main form treatment ARDS delivery oxygen continuous level pressure damage lung mechanical ventilation . However , method mechanical ventilation may cause ventilator-associated lung injury ( VALI ) , condition result overdistension lung inspiration excessive mechanical force . VALI delay prevent heal respiratory failure . HFOV mechanical ventilation method pump small amount air lung constant high rate . Because increment air small likelihood experience overdistension develop VALI may reduce . While HFOV effective , commonly use ventilation method , study demonstrate efficacy HFOV comparison efficacy conventional mechanical ventilation method . This study compare two different HFOV technique : HFOV-Hi method , use high airway pressure , HFOV-Lo method , use low airway pressure . The purpose study compare safety efficacy HFOV-Hi , HFOV-Lo , standard mechanical ventilation method individual ARDS . This study enroll individual ARDS four Baltimore hospital . Participants randomly assign receive either HFOV-Hi HFOV-Lo . All participant receive assign HFOV method 7 day , spontaneous breathing occurs , death , whichever occur first . Blood collect baseline Days 1 3 analyzed marker inflammation lung injury . Participants ' clinical status monitor long need ventilation return home , 60 day hospital . Individuals treat ARDS participate hospital decline enroll study ask permission monitor medical progress . These individual take part study procedure , clinical information use comparison purpose . Additionally , clinical information ARDS patient admit hospital previous 2 year analyze .</detailed_description>
