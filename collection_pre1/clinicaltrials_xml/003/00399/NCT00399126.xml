	<brief_summary>This study drug perifosine give combination paclitaxel . Perifosine oral anti-cancer agent use 140 people . Paclitaxel standard chemotherapy agent use many type cancer . This study design determine high dose perifosine administer people every day receive paclitaxel one two regimen , without severe prolong nausea , vomit diarrhea . This study start patient take 50 mg/day go 150 mg/day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Trial Paclitaxel With Perifosine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , open-label trial perifosine paclitaxel administer either weekly every 3 week patient malignancy single agent paclitaxel reasonable treatment option . All patient receive paclitaxel either dose 80 mg/m2 day 1 , 8 15 28-day cycle ( Arm A ) 175 mg/m2 administer day 8 21 day cycle ( Arm B ) . Patients arm A arm B receive premedication diphenhydramine 50 mg IV 30 minute prior treatment ; ranitidine 50 mg IV 30 minute prior treatment dexamethasone 20 mg IV 30 minute prior treatment . The 1st cohort patient Arm A receive perifosine orally dose 50 mg per day first 21 day 28-day cycle Arm B receive perifosine orally dose 50 mg per day first 14 day 21-day cycle . On arm , perifosine dose escalate subsequent group 50 mg bid 50 mg tid tolerate . ( See ) Alternating cohorts 3 patient enter first Arm A Arm B . The perifosine dose escalation Arm A Arm B perform separately accord follow algorithm . For arm , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define dose give without grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity 1/3 patient . If 2/3 patient cohort encounter grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity , additional 3 patient add . If dose intolerable &gt; 3/6 patient previous dose level declare MTD arm .</detailed_description>
