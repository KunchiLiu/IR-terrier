	<brief_summary>Although injection drug user ( IDUs ) account 70 % new case HCV infection/year , consensus approach medical care . In Canadian centre , patient must free recreational drug use long 6 month consider HCV therapy . This consistent current North American guideline . Over past 5 year , develop successful program treatment HIV infection population , base multi-disciplinary comprehensive program include directly observe therapy ( DOT ) . Even though duration therapy HCV shorter HIV ( little 6 month vs. life-long ) , must address issue administration weekly injection ( interferon ) , twice daily pill ( ribavirin ) risk significant side effect ( include anxiety depression ) successfully expand program treat disease . Further , may even program successful , benefit negate HCV re-infection due continue risk behavior transmission .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Multi-disciplinary Approach Treatment Hepatitis C IDUs ( HI-LO Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We determine HCV infection status potential study subject within cohort 2,000 IDUs receive care centre ( Appendix 1 ) . For carry HCV antibody ( expect n = 1800 ) , test HCV viremia genotype perform . By evaluation , expect 600 individual viremic carry HCV genotype 2 3 . Within group , 200 consecutive patient ( 100/study strategy ) receive therapy HCV , base eligibility accord Provincial guideline reimbursement medication . Patient allocation accord study site regularly receive care . At two site , patient enrol DOT program on-site full-time nursing counsel support ( high intensity , 50 patients/site ) . At two site , patient receive medication weekly basis access part-time nursing counsel support ( low intensity , 50 patients/site ) . Medical follow-up accord current clinical standard , primary endpoint study rate sustain virologic response ( SVR ) six month completion treatment . Within study describe , use standardized methodology calculate total health care cost related treatment HCV infection . We also assess effect treatment quality life ( QoL ) study participant .</detailed_description>
