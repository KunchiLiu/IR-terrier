	<brief_summary>The purpose first-in-man study evaluate safety 188Re-PTI-6D2 patient metastatic melanoma . All patient receive tracer dose 188Re-PTI-6D2 order provide information monoclonal antibody distribute throughout body assess tumor target . No therapeutic dose radiation give first study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study 188Re-PTI-6D2 Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety feasibility administration 188Re-PTI-6D2 patient metastatic melanoma . Patients confirm Stage IIIc ( unresectable ) Stage IV melanoma meet eligibility criterion undergo thorough physical examination baseline tumor imaging ( whole body 18FDG PET/CT MRI brain ) document sit tumor . Treatment administer inpatient basis . An initial cohort 3 patient receive tracer dose 188Re-PTI-6D2 without precede unlabeled antibody . The tracer dose consist 10 mCi rhenium-labeled antibody ; amount antibody ( mg ) depend specific activity estimate range 2 10 mg. Additional cohort three patient receive 10 mg , 20 mg , 50 mg unlabeled PTI-6D2 immediately precede administration tracer dose . Patients undergo serial gamma scan SPECT/CT image specified time point . Blood sample obtain prior dose specify interval PK measurement mAb well measurement serum radioactivity . Urine also collect patient measure excrete radioactivity . Patients closely monitor safety throughout duration study . Patients remain study center 48 hour infusion allow adequate time post-treatment safety observation , monoclonal antibody clearance rhenium decay . Prior escalation dose unlabeled PTI-6D2 , safety data inpatient period 2-week follow-up visit three patient current dose level review . If evidence safety risk , dose unlabeled PTI-6D2 escalate next cohort patient . Dose escalation unlabeled antibody occur accord specific scheme .</detailed_description>
