	<brief_summary>The purpose Metricath Gemini System pre-dilate target treatment area , take arterial lumen measurement native section artery within deployed stent perform dilation deploy stent require . In manner , Metricath Gemini System assist Interventionalist provide arterial measurement prior stenting , perform pre-stenting angioplasty , take within stent measurement help determine stent fully deploy , perform post-stenting dilation dilate stent require .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Metricath Gemini System , Device Intended Make Arterial Measurements Perform Angioplasty Dilations .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several recent clinical study suggest proper vascular stent deployment directly affect clinical outcome , rate re-stenosis . These study suggest angiography alone sufficient ensure proper vascular stent deployment , re-stenosis rate decline proper stent apposition occur . The importance proper stent size apposition emphasise increase use drug elute stent , drug effect realize upon contact arterial wall . Angiometrx Inc. develop Metricath Arterial Measurement System response need increase stent sizing deployment . The Metricath System measure diameter cross sectional area artery use intravascular balloon catheter attach computerized console . Considering ease rapidity obtain Metricath result , technique may form alternative evaluate vessel area stent expansion . The Metricath System 510 ( k ) clear U.S. June , 2003 , receive European Canadian market approval 2004 . Angiometrx Inc. develop next generation Metricath System , incorporate second balloon catheter , intend angioplasty purpose . The Metricath Gemini System comprise dual balloon catheter attach Metricath computerized console Metricath System . As Metricath System , Metricath Console operate inflation deflation Gemini measurement balloon provide arterial cross-sectional area diameter . The Metricath Gemini angioplasty balloon control separately traditional manner use hand-held inflation device , attach port hub catheter .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients coronary artery angiography indicate angioplasty stenting consider . Single vessel disease artery lesion assessable standard coronary guidewires schedule indicate percutaneous coronary intervention . A maximum one lesion require treatment ( angioplasty +/ stenting ) intend arterial diameter 2.5 mm 4.0 mm . Target stent length 15 mm 32 mm , single stent adequately cover lesion . Stenotic de novo lesion native coronary artery . Women pregnant . Participation study involve investigational drug device last six month . Patients previous stenting target vessel area . Patients experience myocardial infarction , Braunwald Class C , unstable Braunwald Class B3 within 6 week prior procedure unstable angina pectoris . Patients experience TIA 's minor major stroke within six month prior procedure . Contraindicated antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation medication . Symptoms cardiogenic shock . Patients underwent stag procedure 30 day prior enrolment and/or schedule stag procedure 14 day treatment . Significant liver kidney disease malignancy . Patients schedule surgery procedure within 30 day . Severe peripheral vascular disease prevent femoral access . Left ventricle ejection fraction &lt; 35 % . Total occlusion target vessel . A blood pressure excess 180 mmHg time angiography . Visible thrombus , fill defect , ulceration target artery . Severely calcified lesion suggest balloon predilatation achieve adequate luminal diameter allow successful stent delivery deployment . The target lesion beyond left main artery stenosis &gt; 50 % . Contraindicated CABG . Coronary spasm absence significant stenosis . Requiring treatment two lesion . Requiring treatment atherectomy . Lesions surgical conduit saphenous vein graft , internal mammary artery , radial artery . Unprotected leave main coronary artery . Diffuse disease . Excessive tortuosity proximal segment .
