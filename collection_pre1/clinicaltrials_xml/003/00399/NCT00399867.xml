	<brief_title>Simvastatin Inhibitor Cell Adhesion Mediated Drug Resistance Patients With Refractory Multiple Myeloma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) incurable haematological neoplasm characterize homing , survival , proliferation malignant , antibody produce plasma cell bone marrow . All clinically relevant symptom ( cytopenia , hyperproteinemia proteinuria renal insufficiency , hypercalcemia , osteolysis ) due aggressive infiltration whole bone marrow MM cell , solid lymphoid organ include peripheral blood normally spar . From clinical observation many preclinical study evident adhesion MM cell bone marrow cell characterize biology disease . Adhesion MM cell lead secretion stimulatory cytokine , upregulation adhesion molecule , proliferation MM cell , drug resistance . Statins , like simvastatin , inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A ( HMG-CoA ) reductase , catalyze conversion HMG-CoA mevalonate . Interestingly , MM model statins induce apoptosis , inhibit proliferation , overcome primary secondary drug resistance , synergize cytotoxic drug . Oligonucleotide microarray analysis demonstrate de novo acquire drug resistance associate increase HMG-CoA reductase gene expression . We show adhesion MM cell bone marrow stromal cell mediate strong multidrug resistance overcome co-treatment simvastatin non-toxic concentration . Interestingly , statin induced apoptosis MM cell hamper adhesion bone marrow stromal cell . Based upon comprehensive preclinical finding clinical trial investigate in-vivo antimyeloma activity statins urgently need . Our vitro study demonstrate inhibition cell adhesion mediate drug resistance simvastatin possible low concentration 1ÂµM . We therefore suggest cell adhesion mediate drug resistance treat approved dos simvastatin ( 80mg daily ) . Consequently initiate pilot phase II trial investigate feasibility clinical effect simvastatin concomitantly chemotherapy preparation randomize trial . As primary goal prove hypothesis simvastatin overcome drug resistance vivo patient respond chemotherapy include . Chemotherapy define bortezomib bendamustin , effective approve drug therapy relapse myeloma . Further inclusion criterion age 18 year , proven MM ( serum protein 11g/dl , life expectancy &gt; 3 month ) treatment indication measurable paraprotein . In case change ( paraprotein increase le 25 % paraprotein decline le 50 % ) two cycle bortezomib ( one cycle : 1.3 mg/m2 d1,4,8,11 ) bendamustin ( one cycle : 100 mg/m2 d1+2 ) patient receive two cycle concomitant simvastatin treatment ( 80 mg daily start two day chemotherapy stop two day chemotherapy ) . Exclusion criterion severe organ failure risk factor rhabdomyolysis ( untreated hypothyroidism , active liver disease , terminal renal insufficiency , acute infectious disease , myopathy , heriditary myopathy family history , alcohol abuse , comedication itraconazole , ketoconazole , erythromycin , clarithromycin , HIV protease inhibitor , nefazodone , cyclosporine , fibrates , niacin , amiodarone , verapamil ) .</detailed_description>
