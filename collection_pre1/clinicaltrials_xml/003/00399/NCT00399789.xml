	<brief_summary>This study drug perifosine consist 2 part . The first part study design determine high dose perifosine administer people every week without severe prolong nausea , vomit diarrhea . This study start patient take 900 mg/week go 1800 mg/week . Part I study complete . The MTD determine incorporate Part II . The goal Part II : 1 . Compare gastrointestinal toxicity 3 different dose-schedules 2 . Obtain preliminary information response rate perifosine non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary purpose Part I study determine maximum dose perifosine administer tolerable gastrointestinal toxicity ; obtain preliminary information response rate perifosine non-small cell lung cancer . In addition , trial design provide insight nature anti-tumor effect , time response , dose-schedules use future trial . Part 2 - In second part study , patient randomize one 3 dose-schedules perifosine test response rate perifosine non small cell lung cancer &gt; 10 % 3 arm study . The study design compare response rate 3 arm trial , toxicity compare . The regimen : - A weekly dose 900 mg divide three dos 300 mg . If patient experience grade 2 toxicity first month therapy , dose escalate 1,200 mg divide four dos 300 mg. - A daily dose 150 mg divide three dos 50 mg . If patient experience grade 2 toxicity first month therapy , dose escalate 200 mg divide four dos 50 mg. - A daily dose 150 mg give one dose bedtime . If patient experience grade 2 toxicity first month therapy , dose escalate 200 mg give one dose bedtime . Patients receive weekly perifosine receive prophylactic antiemetic . Patients receive daily perifosine routinely receive prophylactic antiemetic unless experience nausea . All patient may continue therapy unless disease progression document two occasion least 4 week apart . Patients experience toxicity may continue treatment dos delay reduce .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis nonsmall cell lung cancer , must progress despite standard therapy must candidate surgical combined modality therapy . At least 18 year age . Patients receive least one two prior chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease . The study chairman medical monitor consider extenuate circumstance patient two regimen . Patients must measurable disease . Since outcome patient base response use RECIST criterion , patient must least one measurable lesion accurately measure least one dimension fit one follow criterion : long diameter 20 mm use conventional technique 10 mm spiral CT scan . Patients must life expectancy 3 month . Patients performance status 0 1 accord ECOG criterion . However , patient ECOG performance status 2 may admit approval study chairman medical monitor . Female patient pregnant lactate ineligible . All female childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour treatment . Men woman childbearing potential must agree employ adequate contraception prevent pregnancy therapy four week completion treatment . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Exclusion Criteria Patients rapidly progress disease , define progression within 12 week initiation previous regimen . Patients receive investigational agent device . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition perifosine ( miltefosine edelfosine ) . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction perifosine .
