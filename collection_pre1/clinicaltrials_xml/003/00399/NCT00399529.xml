	<brief_summary>This feasibility study examine combination therapy Trastuzumab ( T ) , Cyclophosphamide ( CY ) , allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting whole cell breast cancer vaccine patient Stage IV HER-2/neu-overexpressing breast cancer . The main purpose study test safety , clinical benefit , bioactivity vaccine therapy combination Cyclophosphamide Trastuzumab patient HER-2/neu-overexpressing Stage IV breast cancer . This study also test whether Cyclophosphamide eliminate suppressive influence regulatory T cell , whether Trastuzumab increase antigen process presentation . These drug activity may make immune system react good enhance effect vaccine treat breast cancer . The vaccine consist two irradiated allogeneic mammary carcinoma cell line genetically modify secrete human granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) . This open label , single arm study design recruit 40 subject identify 20 research subject HER-2/neu-overexpressing Stage IV breast cancer eligible study treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trastuzumab , Cyclophosphamide , Allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting Breast Tumor Vaccine Treatment HER-2/Neu-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer rank second among cancer death woman ( American Cancer Society , 2005 ) . In year 2005 , American Cancer Society estimate 212,240 new invasive case breast cancer diagnose , predict 40,410 death result breast cancer . While 80 % patient present locoregional disease involve breast and/or axillary lymph node , half develop disseminate disease ultimately die . Stage IV breast cancer typically manage hormonal agent conventional cytotoxic drug . Tumors quickly become resistant treatment . Immunotherapy particularly attractive strategy overcome drug resistance integrate exist therapeutic modality additive synergistic fashion . Immunotherapy type treatment cancer base idea immune system activate destroy cancer cell might resistant hormonal therapy chemotherapy . A vaccine kind immunotherapy delivers antigen ( something activate immune system ) immune system recognize cell antigen foreign destroys cell display antigen . The allogeneic breast tumor cell vaccine consist two type breast tumor cell develop tumor cell patient breast cancer . The human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) gene use genetically modify breast tumor cell secrete GM-CSF . GM-CSF substance make body help immune system recognize tumor destroy . The vaccine cell irradiated prevent grow divide . The cell radioactive . The cell store frozen day vaccination . The total number cell vaccine 500,000,000 , divide twelve injection give thigh arm . The choice twelve injection vaccine base volume vaccine find body well chance respond vaccine inject number different area . We propose test safety bioactivity allogeneic GM-CSF-secreting breast cancer vaccine give specifically timed sequence Cyclophosphamide Trastuzumab , two drug commonly use treat breast cancer . In study Cyclophosphamide use low dos usual help vaccine activate patient 's immune system . Trastuzumab give dos commonly use treat breast cancer may also increase immune response . The dose scheduling Cyclophosphamide Trastuzumab use base test drug GM-CSF-secreting vaccine mouse get breast cancer , one enable vaccine induce potent anti-tumor immunity . The dose vaccine cell base safety dose similar GM-CSF-secreting vaccine pancreatic cancer . This breast cancer vaccine also give people breast cancer , Cyclophosphamide another chemotherapy drug , Doxorubicin . To date , people vaccine-related serious side effect , enough people receive vaccine know treat breast cancer . The vaccine experimental approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . However , FDA permit use research study . This second study breast cancer vaccine first study test vaccine Trastuzumab . The main purpose study test safety , clinical benefit , bioactivity vaccine therapy combination Cyclophosphamide Trastuzumab patient HER-2/neu-overexpressing Stage IV breast cancer . This study also test whether Cyclophosphamide eliminate suppressive influence regulatory T cell , whether Trastuzumab increase antigen process presentation . These drug activity may make immune system react good enhance effect vaccine treat breast cancer . The study open men woman HER-2/neu-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer . Concurrent hormone therapy and/or bisphosphonates ( standard breast cancer therapy chemotherapy investigational therapy ) allow . Patients may receive Trastuzumab past continue participate study . About 40 people HER-2/neu positive breast cancer enter study . About 20 pas screening test receive vaccine . Research subject receive fix dose allogeneic breast tumor vaccine consist two irradiated allogeneic breast cancer cell line transfected GM-CSF gene specifically time sequence low dose Cyclophosphamide Trastuzumab . Patients receive 300 mg/m2 Cyclophosphamide day -1 , vaccine day 0 . Weekly Trastuzumab time coincide Cyclophosphamide administration . Research subject receive three monthly vaccination cycle , fourth final ( boost ) vaccination cycle three month third cycle . Blood sample measure GM-CSF level take day vaccination , every day 4 day , day 7 vaccination . Blood sample evaluate safety vaccination take week one month follow vaccination . During study breast vaccine similar vaccine renal cell cancer , prostate cancer , pancreatic cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , local symptom swell redness develop vaccine site 2 7 day vaccination . In study , subject 's vaccination site show swell 1 cm diameter , skin biopsy take . The skin biopsy evaluate determine type cell important immune response . Based previous preclinical clinical data , biopsy take day 3 , possibly day 7 , first third vaccination . Other test evaluation include history physical examination , vital sign , CT chest , abdomen , pelvis , nuclear medicine bone scan , pre-vaccination biopsy , blood immune monitoring , skin test delayed-type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) like PPD test involve inject piece protein antigen ( HER-2/neu ) deliver breast cancer vaccine . The purpose DTH test evaluate whether research subject develop systemic immune response breast cancer vaccine . Tumor core needle biopsy obtain baseline , day 0 +14 vaccine cycle 1 . Patients evaluate clinically laboratory test evidence disease progression cycle otherwise clinically indicate . Computed tomography ( CT scan ) chest , abdomen , pelvis nuclear medicine bone scan also perform evaluate disease status prior start study , vaccine cycle 3 prior vaccine cycle 4 . About every three month cardiac function evaluate .</detailed_description>
