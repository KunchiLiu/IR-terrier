	<brief_summary>There many improvement care child hypoplastic leave heart syndrome ( HLHS ) . This help child survive longer . Because child live long , researcher recognize developmental disability ( child behind think physical activity ) child hypoplastic leave heart syndrome . The purpose research study help investigator learn developmental disability child hypoplastic leave heart syndrome . During time child 's first surgery hypoplastic leave heart syndrome , monitor place child 's forehead measure oxygen level brain . This monitor call Near Infrared Spectrometry ( NIRS ) . The researcher involve study want know oxygen level blood vessel brain effect developmental disability later life child hypoplastic leave heart syndrome . The researcher plan enroll 60 research subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our study cross-sectional , descriptive study evaluate developmental outcome school-age child HLHS . The general approach propose research confirmatory study/hypothesis test . The hypothesis ( neurodevelopmental outcome child HLHS inversely correlate cerebral oximetry value measure NIRS 48 hour follow Norwood operation ) formulate base meticulous review literature , clearly demonstrate substantial prevalence neurodevelopmental deficit child HLHS undergone surgical palliation . The methodology measure developmental outcome highly reproducible validated population .</detailed_description>
