	<detailed_description>This study Phase I trial two part . In part 1 , MTD combination perifosine sunitinib malate determine . In previous trial perifosine biologic agent , dos determine Phase I study well tolerate large group patient response endpoint . Thus part 2 , MTD start point , group patient accrue goal ensure able tolerate least two course therapy , would make evaluable response Phase II study . As secondary endpoint , effect combination perifosine sunitinib malate evaluate response rate time progression . The pharmacokinetics combination study drug measure . For purpose study , one cycle therapy define 6 week . Patients take one 50 mg tablet perifosine one three time day sunitinib malate day 4 6 week . Patients may need anti-emetics and/or anti-diarrheals . Patients evaluate progression response 12-week interval . Patients experience toxicity may continue treatment dos delay reduce . All patient continue therapy unless disease progression document two occasion least four week apart . Part 1 Phase I study accrue six 24 patient depend number dose level evaluate . Up six patient treat dose level . A dose limiting toxicity ( DLT ) define : - Grade 3 great non-hematologic toxicity - Grade 4 hematologic toxicity</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis renal tumor GIST eligible protocol . Patients solid tumor type must case review OCOG medical monitor . The physician must believe patient 's course growth rate tumor patient would feel comfortable continue treatment 12 week even transient period modest tumor growth first week follow initiation perifosine sunitinib malate treatment . Patients must life expectancy 6 month . Patients may receive prior sorafenib sunitinib malate . Patients may measurable evaluable disease . Patients performance status 0 1 accord ECOG criterion . However , patient ECOG performance status 2 may admit approval study chairman medical monitor . Patients must adequate organ marrow function , unless opinion treat investigator , abnormality relate tumor study chairman medical monitor agree abnormality unlikely affect safety perifosine and/or sunitinib use . Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy include surgery radiotherapy , exclude alopecia . Patients must able ingest oral medication obtain gastrostomy tube . Patients must least 18 year age . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . LVEF great equal 50 % . Rapidly progress disease , define progression within 8 week initiation previous regimen Patients three prior systemic therapy , include biologics , exclude unless prior approval obtain medical monitor Patients receive investigational agent device Patients initiate treatment cancer within last two month continue concomitantly perifosine History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition perifosine ( miltefosine edelfosine ) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Patients currently take strong inhibitor CYP3A4 family ( e.g. , ketoconazole , itraconazole , clarithromycin , atazanavir , indinavir , nefazodone , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , telithromycin , voriconazole ) AND inducer CYP3A4 family ( e.g. , dexamethasone , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentin , phenobarbital , St. John 's Wort ) possible pharmacokinetic interaction sunitinib . Patients longer take strong CYP3A4 inhibitor and/or inducer ineligible unless discontinue use 4 week prior begin therapy . HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction perifosine . Patients history unstable newly diagnose angina pectoris , recent myocardial infarction ( within 6 month enrollment ) , New York Heart Association class IIIV congestive heart failure Female patient pregnant lactate ineligible . All female childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour treatment . Men woman childbearing potential must agree employ adequate contraception prevent pregnancy therapy 4 week completion treatment .</criteria>
