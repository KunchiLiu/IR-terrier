	<brief_title>Octreotide Therapy Children Young Adults With Prader-Willi Syndrome ( PWS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity continue prevalent health concern affect every race American population . According data World Health Organization , 54 % U.S. adult overweight ( body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 25 kg/m2 ) 22 % obese ( BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) ( 1 ) . In addition , 25 % U.S. child overweight obese ( 1 ) . Studies show obese child likely become obese adult ( 2-5 ) . Also , recent study report significant year life lose due impact obese adult ( 6 , 7 ) . Thus , insight pathogenesis childhood obesity preventative measure need combat inevitable increase worldwide incidence obesity associate co-morbidities . Recent study identify new gastroenteric hormone , ghrelin , long-term regulator energy balance human ( 12 ) . Ghrelin 28 amino acid acylated peptide endogenous ligand growth hormone secretagogue receptor ( GHS-R ) , hypothalamic G-protein-coupled receptor ( 13 ) . Enteroendocrine cell ( X/A-like cell ) stomach major site ghrelin synthesis , although minor proportion ghrelin synthesis occur site hypothalamus , pituitary , duodenum , jejunum lung ( 14 ) ( 15 , 16 ) . The hypothesis hyperghrelinemia cause feature PWS predict disorder ameliorate ( partially completely ) lower ghrelin level . We recently show somatostatin agonist , octreotide , suppresses ghrelin level human . If octreotide remain effective long term study , drug may become adjuvant therapy , addition growth hormone , control insatiable appetite morbid obesity see condition .</detailed_description>
