	<brief_summary>A healthy diet exercise improve health people without human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Metabolic Syndrome . In study would like find benefit see people HIV Metabolic Syndrome . Patients Metabolic Syndrome usually large waist , high blood cholesterol level , high blood pressure , high blood sugar level . These risk factor , may increase one 's chance develop heart disease and/or diabetes . The purpose study evaluate effect different method treat HIV associate Metabolic Syndrome . The group : 1 ) lifestyle modification program plus metformin ( also know glucophage ) , 2 ) lifestyle modification plus placebo , 3 ) metformin alone 4 ) placebo alone . The lifestyle modification program consist nutrition exercise session goal improve body composition , heart health , way low risk develop diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After two initial screen visit medical nutrition staff inform consent determination eligibility qualify subject see baseline visit . At baseline subject interval history physical exam , lipodystrophy evaluation investigator patient report . Bloods take insulin , glucose , HgbA1c , lipid study , creatinine , liver function , serum lactate , urine pregnancy ( woman ) , CD4 , viral load , complete blood count ( CBC ) . Metabolic assessment include 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test indirect calorimetry . Carotid ultrasound do assessment intima-media thickness . Body composition assess dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) , single-slice magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan abdomen mid thigh , magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan assess intramyocellular lipid calf , anthropometric measurement , Cardiac compute tomography ( CT ) do . After baseline visit , subject randomize 1 4 group : 1 ) lifestyle modification program plus metformin ( also know glucophage ) , 2 ) lifestyle modification plus placebo , 3 ) metformin alone 4 ) placebo alone . The start dose metformin 500mg twice daily increase 850mg twice daily 3-month visit . An identical visit baseline repeat 12-months . Subjects return 1 month interval history physical exam , assessment compliance side effect . Blood collect CBC , lactate , liver function , creatinine . Women urine pregnancy . A 6-month visit include interval history physical exam , assessment compliance side effect , 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test , fast blood ( glucose , lipid panel , creatinine , liver function , serum lactate , CBC ) do , urine pregnancy check woman . Carotid ultrasound do body composition assess anthropometric measurement DEXA scan . There also short visit 3 9 month obtain interval history physical exam , safety lab ( serum lactate , CBC , liver function , creatinine ) , urine pregnancy ( woman ) . Subjects randomize metformin placebo increase dose 500mg twice daily 850mg twice daily 3 month visit . At visit review 4 day food record occur . Those randomized lifestyle modification attend weekly session study investigator cover `` core-curriculum '' model Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) intervention . The primary goal lifestyle modification program derive combination recommendation American Academy Clinical Endocrinologists ( AACE ) National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) . The goal eat less equal 35 % total calorie fat ( less 7 % saturate fat , 10 % polyunsaturated fat emphasis source omega 3 fatty acid reduction trans fatty acid , 20 % monounsaturated fat ) , 25-35g fiber per day . The intensity counseling session decrease month 10 12 biweekly counsel session study investigator biweekly phone contact , alternate . In addition program outline , randomize lifestyle modification group also participate progressive resistance training . Each training session begin 5 minute warm-up stationary bicycle 50 % estimate maximal heart rate ( maximal heart rate=220-age ) . All session monitor licensed physical therapist . Immediately warm-up , standard flexibility routine perform minimize risk injury . Then , aerobic training protocol perform . The aerobic training program follow general guideline establish American College Sports Medicine . Training perform use standard stationary bicycle . Aerobic/endurance exercise perform large muscle group . Each subject complete three supervise training session per week 12 month . Strength training perform use Keiser equipment . Selected muscle group train alternate upper low exercise follow order : 1 ) hip extension , 2 ) lateral pull , 3 ) knee extension , 4 ) elbow flexion , 5 ) knee flexion , 6 ) chest press . Each repetition include concentric eccentric phase . Each muscle group train individually 3 time per week , alternate day . The subject perform three set 10 repetition every muscle group , rest 2-3 second repetition , 2 minute set , 4 minute muscle group . The 1 repetition maximum measure every 3-4 week first 6 month repeat 9 12 month visit . The relative intensity increase 60-80 % 1 repetition maximum 6 month . Subjects randomize train determination 1 repetition maximum make baseline , 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
