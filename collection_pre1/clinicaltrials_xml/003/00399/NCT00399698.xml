	<brief_summary>This study develop order ass effect risperidone ( Risperdal ) compare placebo cognitive-motor performance ( attention , memory , hand steadiness ) body movement . We propose study effect risperidone cognitive-motor performance child already medicate severe conduct problem . We would also like look safety assess child dyskinetic movement . We already sizable cohort child maintain risperidone . Our hypothesis follow : 1 . Risperidone adverse effect cognitive-motor performance child receive maintenance therapy 4 20 month . 2 . Children test placebo show dyskinetic movement risperidone treatment ( i.e. , unmask tardive dyskinesia ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Whether There Are Any Cognitive Motor Effects From Taking Medicine Risperidone .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antipsychotics fairly commonly use manage certain psychiatric disorder occur childhood : schizophrenia , autistic disorder , delusional manic depressive disorder , bipolar disorder , conduct disorder , disruptive behavior associate mental retardation ( Botteron &amp; Geller , 1998 ) . They also occasionally use ADHD conventional treatment , psychostimulants tricyclic antidepressant , fail ( Botteron &amp; Geller , 1998 ) . Despite helpful role antipsychotic medication many childhood condition , persistent although poorly substantiate impression medicine cause `` cognitive blunting '' child . This may commonly hear see print , believe cause considerable resistance antipsychotic treatment physician nonmedical professional alike . At time , data support notion cognitive blunting antipsychotic medicine largely negative ( although limited amount ) frequently badly date ( see Ernst , Malone , Rowan , George , Gonzales , &amp; Silva , 1998 ; Aman , 1984 ; Aman , Marks , Turbott , Wilsher , &amp; Merry , 1991 ) . There good theoretical reason believe novel antipsychotic may effect cognition may actually enhance cognitive functioning , least disorder ( Borison , 1996 ; Meltzer , 1995 ; Stip , 1996 ) . At least one study thus far show significantly improve cognitive performance schizophrenic patient take risperidone compare patient take high-potency classical antipsychotic treatment ( Gallhofer , Bauer , Lis , Krieger , &amp; Gruppe , 1996 ) . Another source resistance use antipsychotic medicine young people possibility may cause tardive dyskinesia . However , available data novel antipsychotic suggest substantially safer classical antipsychotic respect . Nevertheless , data limit newness agent like risperidone . Our laboratory O.S.U . unique sophisticated computer-controlled cognitive-motor test battery . O.S.U . one seven university support NIMH part network Research Units Pediatric Psychopharmacology ( `` RUPPs '' ) . Recently , Dr. Mike Aman review available cognitive test system behalf Autism RUPP Group . From exercise , become quite clear u maintain probably world 's best system assess cognitive-motor effect psychotropic drug child , especially child developmental handicap . The experimental ( research ) portion treatment ass effect risperidone ( Risperdal ) learn performance motor movement child . This study look whether risperidone improve performance certain cognitive-motor task . It also look detect negative side effect medicine child 's body movement . Risperidone often use treat child disruptive behavior . This study involve 18-20 child treat physician risperidone ( duration 4 month longer ) behavior problem .</detailed_description>
