	<detailed_description>This phase 1 , open-label trial perifosine docetaxel without prednisone patient malignancy single agent docetaxel reasonable treatment option . All patient receive docetaxel dose 75 mg/m2 day 8 21-day cycle either without ( Arm A ) prednisone 5 mg bid day 1 - 21 ( Arms B C ) . ( Patients arm receive premedication dexamethasone around time docetaxel administration either describe product insert arm A use prior prostate cancer phase III study arm B C. The 1st cohort patient Arm A Arm B receive perifosine orally dose 50 mg per day first 14 day 21-day cycle . On arm , perifosine dose escalate subsequent group 50 mg bid 50 mg tid tolerate . Alternating cohort 3 patient enter first Arm A Arm B . At completion arm A B , 3 cohort patient enter receive perifosine weekly dos 900 , 1200 1500 mg . The total dose divide 300 mg dos deliver least 4 hour apart . The perifosine dose escalation arm perform separately accord follow algorithm . For arm , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define dose give without grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity 1/3 patient . If 2/3 patient cohort encounter grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity , additional 3 patient add . If dose intolerable &gt; 3/6 patient previous dose level declare MTD arm .</detailed_description>
