	<brief_summary>A thorough ophthalmic examination child must include refraction often do cycloplegia . In study , aim determine age group non-cycloplegic refraction technique closely correlate cycloplegic refraction hence , would obviate need cycloplegic refraction routine clinical practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Cycloplegic Refraction Subjective Refraction With Fogging School Age Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The accommodative response young phakic patient know result over-estimation myopia subsequently inappropriate prescription . Therefore , rationale cycloplegia inhibit accommodative response order obtain true measurement refractive error . Different cycloplegic agent common use last five decade . Cyclopentolate widely use commercially available concentration 0.5 % 1 % . Tropicamide another widely use cycloplegic agent available 0.5 % 1 % concentration . The advantages non-cycloplegic technique would firstly , avoidance possible harmful effect cycloplegic agent use . Secondly , would vastly reduce wait time parent child allow much efficient clinical service . Finally , may significant cost-saving feature involve cycloplegic agent longer require . This prospective clinical audit/survey involve child age 4 year 13 year attend paediatric ophthalmology clinic KK Women 's Children 's Hospital well Singapore National Eye Centre . All eligible child cycloplegic refraction non-cycloplegic refraction fogging . A survey child age 4 13 year refraction techniques undertaken difference spherical error 2 technique record child . We aim accumulate 15 child age group .</detailed_description>
