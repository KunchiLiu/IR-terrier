	<brief_summary>Superior sulcus deformity post-enucleation socket syndrome ( PESS ) may pose significant cosmetic blemish enucleation surgery despite apparently adequate orbital volume replacement . The underlying reason include lack accurate pre-operative volumetric assessment anophthalmic socket , lead either estimation orbital implant require shift orbital periocular structure may occur post enucleation . Conventional imaging study ( compute tomography magnetic resonance imaging ) use study anatomy anophthalmic socket , several drawback poor image quality detail volumetric assessment , long exposure time possible motion artifact etc . The new multi-detector compute tomographic technology late advance diagnostic radiology allow rapid high resolution image obtain three dimensional reconstruction volumetric assessment . This new image modality contribute greatly understanding PESS surgical planning anophthalmic socket reconstruction . This pilot study aim collect clinical data volumetric structural change PESS . The information obtain : 1. allow accurate volume estimation primary orbital implant prior enucleation surgery , thus minimize development PESS ; 2. evaluate volumetric &amp; structural anomaly constitute PESS 3. use development new customize secondary orbital implant manage superior sulcus deformity PESS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Purpose : Primary aim : Three dimensional volumetric assessment change orbital soft tissue patient post-enucleation socket syndrome , use new 16-slice multi-detector compute tomography scanner . Background : Post-enucleation socket syndrome ( PESS - enophthalmos , superior sulcus deformity , ptosis upper eyelid retraction lower eyelid laxity1 ) well recognize late complication enucleation surgery . The underlying pathophysiology , however , well establish . It especially prominent inadequate orbital volume replacement contraction socket.2 Superior sulcus deformity ( Fig.1 ) manifest deep groove space upper eyelid superior orbital rim . In review Smerdon Sutton , significant factor related poor cosmetic satisfaction.3 It suggest loss orbital volume relaxation tissue causes.4 With advance orbital implant development , patient receive implant replacement enucleation surgery shortly afterward improve cosmetic outcome . A survey among member American Society Ophthalmic Plastic Reconstructive Surgery report total 2,779 primary orbital implant perform year.5 An ideal orbital implant replaces 70-80 % volume enucleate ( ~5ml , i.e . implant size 20-22mm ) , ocular prosthesis fill rest ( ~2ml ) . But prediction implant size relatively subjective inaccurate . They influence factor like phthisis , configuration orbit , placement extraocular muscle , shape implant , use implant warp orbital fat volume.6 In retrospective study Kaltreider et al , 76 % patient would benefit large implant 63 % would need implant size large 22mm.7 On contrary , prospective study Custer Trinkaus , implant large 22mm needed.8 However study , patient less volumetric replacement show significantly severe enophthalmos superior sulcus deformity . Different surgical procedure , mostly secondary volume augmentation 9-19 , suggest treat superior sulcus deformity PESS . They categorize subperiosteal implant orbital floor eyelid implants.20 Besides filling orbital volume , subperiosteal implant produce upward forward displacement orbital content correct superior sulcus deformity . Cosmetic improvement eyelid implant filler material achieve add bulk hollow area brow upper eyelid crease directly . In spite , information accurate pre-operative volumetric assessment anophthalmic socket remain inadequate , result occasional revision volume augmented.21 Conventional imaging study use various oculoplastic condition two decade . In study orbital anatomy pathology , Nugent RA et al demonstrate change extraocular muscle ( diameter &amp; volume ) patient Graves ' orbitopathy second generation CT scanner find correlate well clinical findings22 . In area anophthalmic socket , compute tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) contribute understanding condition . With use high resolution CT , Smith et al demonstrate deepen superior sulcus , sag &amp; retraction superior muscle complex , distal elevation &amp; retraction inferior rectus downward &amp; forward redistribution orbital fat 22 anophthalmic socket without orbital implant insertion . They suggest rotatory displacement orbital content superior posterior posterior inferior.23 In anophthalmic socket orbital implant , Detorakis 's group use 2mm cut MRI scan demonstrate statistically insignificant decrease rectus muscle volume change orbital fat volume 5 patient enucleation surgery.24 Despite information obtain , multiple drawback : poor image quality detail volumetric assessment , increase radiation exposure separate scan axial coronal plane , contra-indicated patient metallic foreign body injury , long exposure time possible motion artifact,25 neither investigation translate pre-operative volumetric assessment surgical planning . Multi-detector CT ( MDCT ) new advance CT technology . It provide unparalleled capability detail analysis normal anatomy pathology . MDCT allow high resolution sub-millimeter image acquisition , potentially true isotropic datasets , important production good quality image multi-planar reformation volumetric assessment . In study anophthalmic socket PESS , high quality three dimensional reconstruction image mean accurate analysis orbital soft tissue without need additional CT acquisition different plane . In study compare radiation exposure MDCT conventional CT image para-nasal sinus , Zammit-Maempel et al demonstrate 84 % reduction radiation exposure MDCT , radiation dose 9mGy 54 time less threshold dose 0.5-2Gy detectable lens opacities26 . Moreover , since require coverage less imaging anophthalmic socket , expect even small safer dose radiation exposure . Last least , 16-slice MDCT scanner faster conventional scanner , shorten examination time minimize motion artifact . Despite publish data , patho-physiology PESS remain unclear management far satisfactory . We plan answer question anophthalmic socket 3 stage : 1 . Anatomical radiological analysis 1 . With pilot study try identify volumetric change change anatomical relationship orbital soft tissue anophthalmic socket compare contra-lateral eye . 2 . Although MRI provide superior soft tissue contrast , CT still provide good detail eye , orbital soft tissue bony orbit important pre-operative surgical planning secondary sub-periosteal orbital implant27 . 2 . Bioengineering animal study ( information obtain part 1 ) 1 . We assess usefulness MDCT i. correct size primary orbital implant prevent PESS ; ii . correct size effective placement secondary orbital implant restore volumetric positional change PESS . 2 . In addition , use VGStudio MAX software , may able offer customize secondary orbital implant optimal correction PESS . 3 . Clinical trial</detailed_description>
