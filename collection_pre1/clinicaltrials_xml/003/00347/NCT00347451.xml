	<brief_summary>The prevalence myopia East Asia Singapore particular amongst high world , estimate range 30-70 % general population . Up 30 % high myope . High myopia associate degenerative change fundus . It may also associate vision-threatening complication macular hole . The pathogenesis macular hole high myope completely understood postulate include combination anterior vitreous traction posterior staphyloma formation axial elongation . These force lead degenerative change macula , include foveal detachment retinoschisis precede formation lamellar full thickness macular hole . These change difficult detect either clinically conventional image ultrasound , make effort correct early stage surgery difficult . High myopia also associate two- threefold increase risk develop glaucoma . However , diagnosis glaucoma high myope difficult many pathological change myopic eye mimic see glaucoma . The myopic optic disc particular notoriously difficult differentiate glaucomatous disc . Currently , diagnosis highly subjective , rely observation clinical appearance disc disc photos.Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) evolve technology relies time delay reflect backscatter light interferometry yield cross-sectional image retina optic disc . The Stratus OCT late model demonstrate able yield image resolution comparable histology . It thus potentially useful assess degenerative change occur myopic fundus , evaluate early change precede macular hole formation , provide objective measure various disc parameter aid diagnose glaucoma high myope . This study aim recruit 150 healthy , young , ophthalmologically normal male SAF examine OCT. High myope ( â‰¤-8D ) select compare control group low myope . The performance OCT evaluate current diagnostic method .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary AimThe aim study evaluate retinal macular topography , vitreomacular relationship optic nerve head change highly myopic eye young adult . Specific aim include:1 ) To determine prevalence vitreo-macular traction macular degeneration ( macular thickening , detachment , schisis lamellar hole ) asymptomatic , highly myopic young Asian male use OCT.2 ) To characterize measure optic nerve head peripapillary retinal nerve fibre layer change high myopia use OCT.3 ) To compare OCT finding current method investigation diagnosis SubjectsSubjects draw in-service personnel well recruit await enlistment . They identify base refraction SAF 's computerized medical record system.Informed consent sought subject commencement . All subject healthy young male ophthalmologically normal apart myopia . The main exclusion criterion are:1 ) Best correct visual acuity &lt; 6/92 ) Previous intraocular surgery3 ) Intraocular pressure &gt; 21mmHg4 ) Gonioscopic finding angle closure5 ) Clinical evidence pseudo-exfoliation , uveitis pigment dispersion syndrome , corneal medium opacity , retinal pathology neurological diseases6 ) Family history first degree relative glaucoma optic neuropathy.Excluded subject replace subject next-in-line cohort.ProcedureAll subject identify examine SNEC/SERI one investigator . The assessment subject include:1 ) Autorefraction perform non-accommodating target record best correct visual acuity . 2 ) Slit lamp examination , Goldmann applanation tonometry , gonioscopy , examination Goldmann three-mirror lens , dilate fundus examination 78 diopter fundus lens . Retinal finding record standard Amsler Dubois retinal diagram . Grading background myopic chorioretinal change accordance scheme propose Avila . 3 ) Axial length measurement . Ultrasound A scan perform eye . Axial length ascertain average six consistent recording . Care take locate fovea especially case posterior staphyloma , ensure fixation A scan probe light . 4 ) Fundus photography Topcon camera . Stereoscopic disc photograph also take comparison OCT scan optic nerve head.5 ) OCT use Stratus OCTOCT measurement perform one sit trained technician . The commercially prescribe Optic Disc , RNFL Macular Thickness scan algorithm use . Each subject fixate internal target present computer possible , external fixation target case unable cooperate . Subjects encourage blink acquisition radial scan minimize discomfort minimize effect irregular tear film corneal desiccation tear film . Each scan take approximately 2.5s , make total image acquisition time less minute . The optic nerve head scan consist six radial scan center optic nerve head . The computer generate disc margin use reference optic nerve head measurement . The macular thickness protocol use six radial scan center fovea . The retinal thickness measure automatically distance vitreoretinal interface junction inner outer segment photoreceptors .</detailed_description>
