	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Treatments Convergence Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Considerable controversy exist regard best treatment convergence insufficiency ( CI ) , common condition often interfere ability perform near work . The two widely use treatment significant difference cost practitioner perceived utility . Pencil push-up therapy ( PPT ) simple , low-cost treatment patient prescribe single procedure perform home periodic follow-up . Office-based vision therapy ( OBVT ) comprehensive , time-consuming , complex , costly treatment patient scheduled weekly in-office therapy visit often prescribe specific sequence therapeutic procedure perform home . It important consider whether either , neither , treatment effective . The Convergence Insufficiency Treatment Trial ( CITT ) prospective , masked-examiner , multi-center clinical trial patient randomize one two treatment approach . The primary goal answer follow question : After 12 week treatment , one therapy effective improve CI sign symptom ? We test null hypothesis difference distribution outcomes two population . The primary outcome measure classification patient “ success , ” “ improvement , ” “ failure. ” This classification base level improvement sign ( near point convergence positive fusional vergence ) symptoms CI . Additional question relate long term effect : 1 . Are patient classified “ success ” “ improvement ” twelve week one-year follow-up treatment group ? 2 . Are differences distribution change near point convergence , positive fusional vergence , accommodative amplitude , two treatment group , twelve week one-year follow ?</detailed_description>
