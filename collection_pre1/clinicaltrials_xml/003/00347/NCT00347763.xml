	<brief_title>Effect Intensive Fly Control Trachoma Ocular Chlamydia Infection Tanzania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trachoma lead infectious cause blindness world . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) , recognize important public health impact trachoma , adopt resolution eliminate blinding trachoma year 2020 ( 3 ) . In order accomplish ambitious goal , WHO recommend use `` SAFE '' strategy country implement trachoma control program . This multi-faceted approach include Surgery trichiasis case , Antibiotics treat community pool infection , Face wash reduce transmission , Environmental change . The environmental change component currently rest largely effort reduce fly population community . A pilot study clinical trial use intense insecticide spray reduced fly trachoma trachoma hypo-endemic area The Gambia . In The Gambia setting , fly appear important vector trachoma , clear fly equally important area hyper-endemic trachoma , know fly control add value provision mass antibiotic treatment active trachoma part SAFE strategy . The purpose community-based randomize trial determine , trachoma hyper-endemic community Tanzania , add value intensive spray control fly fly population trachoma ocular C. trachomatis infection 6 month one year mass antibiotic treatment . Neighborhoods intensive spraying ( Intervention ) neighborhood spray ( control ) receive mass antibiotic treatment azithromycin immediately prior start study , enable u evaluate additional impact fly control trachoma . Kongwa district central Tanzania show high prevalence active trachoma , choose site study . We randomize sixteen balozi receive either mass treatment azithromycin alone ( control ) , mass treatment plus intensive fly spray program ( intervention ) . Pre-school age child reservoirs infection disease within community . Therefore , within balozi , child age less eight serve sentinel marker status trachoma baseline , 6 month , one year baseline . In eight intervention balozi , 119 child 87 family enrol baseline , eight control balozi , 183 child 145 family enrol . The balozis survey area surround intervention balozis target insecticide spray . A solution 10 % permethrin water use Hudson MicronAir sprayer machine , At outset , spray carry every two day two week ( attack phase ) per week ( maintenance phase ) rest study . Two sticky trap , fly paper strip place balozi capture fly . The trap change every week , number fly capture count . If average number intervention balozis exceed 25 % control balozis , attack phase , describe , reinstituted keep fly population low intervention group . The primary outcome prevalence trachoma pre-school age child 6 month one year post mass antibiotic treatment.Outcomes report base masked photographic grading . Secondary outcome ocular C. trachomatis infection , base use Amplicor C. trachomatis qualitative PCR assay . comparison : Balozi randomize receive intensive fly spray intervention , compare Balozi fly spray intervention</detailed_description>
