	<criteria>Subject give sign informed consent . Subject male female 18 year age time informed consent sign . At Screening visit , subject document history current presentation stage 1 stage 2 hypertension ( see Section 15.1 , Appendix 1 Section 15.4 , Appendix 4 ) meet one follow criterion . Note : All blood pressure mean sit cuff pressure : Documented history hypertension receive two antihypertensive medication mean sDBP &lt; 90 mmHg diabetic subject ( define establish diagnosis diabetes receive treatment diabetes ) , mean sDBP &lt; 80 mmHg . Subjects take beta blocker , clonidine , antihypertensive medication abrupt discontinuation would clinical concern must taper medication Washout/Placebo Runin phase avoid rebound hypertension . All subject must able safely withdraw antihypertensive treatment Washout/Placebo Runin phase . Subjects enrol investigator think likely subject 's mean sDBP exceed 109 mmHg mean sSBP exceed 180 mmHg Washout/Placebo Runin phase ( NOTE : A combination drug contain two antihypertensive agent represent two antihypertensive medication [ e.g. , Hyzaar losartan potassium AND hydrochlorothiazide , therefore , count two antihypertensive medication ] . ) OR Receiving one antihypertensive medication mean sDBP =109 mmHg safely withdrawn antihypertensive medication Washout/Placebo Runin phase . Any subject receiving betablockers , clonidine , antihypertensive medication abrupt discontinuation would clinical concern must dose tapered Washout/Placebo Runin phase avoid rebound hypertension . All subject must able safely withdraw antihypertensive treatment Washout/Placebo Runin phase . Subjects enrol investigator think likely subject 's mean sDBP exceed 109 mmHg mean sSBP exceed 180 mmHg Washout/Placebo Runin phase . ( NOTE : A combination drug contain two antihypertensive agent represent two antihypertensive medication [ e.g. , Hyzaar losartan potassium AND hydrochlorothiazide , therefore , count two antihypertensive medication ] . OR Untreated/newly diagnosed subject : mean sDBP =95 =109 , diabetic subject , mean sDBP =85 =109 ( see Section 15.1 , Appendix 1 ) . If newly diagnose , must qualify blood pressure confirm two consecutive visit mean sDBP value differ 8 mmHg . ( Previously untreated subject include subject treat hypertension last two months. ) . At Baseline : DAY BEFORE RANDOMIZATION : Prior baseline ABPM equipment place , subject mean sit cuff DBP ≥93 ≤111 mmHg ( diabetic subject , ≥83 ≤111 mmHg ) . Subjects take antihypertensive medication Screening meet criterion one week ( 5 halflives , whichever long ) , return one week ±1day his/her blood pressure evaluate inclusion criterion . AND RANDOMIZATON DAY : After completion ABPM assessment , subject meet follow ABPM ( 12 hr 24 hr ) criterion ( see Section 15.1 , Appendix 1 ) : Mean 12hour daytime ( 9 AM 9 PM ) DBP ≥90 ≤109mmHg ( diabetic subject , ≥80 ≤109mmHg ) At least 75 % programmed reading properly record 24hour monitoring period No two nonconsecutive hour less two successful reading per hour awake , two consecutive hour less one successful read per hour sleep period 24hour monitoring period At least two successful reading per hour three last four hour record ( trough period i.e. , 2024 hour subject must awake ) total least 7 successful reading period . Subject take ≥3 antihypertensive medication . ( NOTE : A combination drug contain two antihypertensive agent represent two antihypertensive medication [ e.g. , Hyzaar losartan potassium AND hydrochlorothiazide , therefore , count two antihypertensive medication ] . ) Subject DBP =90 mmHg ( diabetic subject , DBP =80 mmHg ) two antihypertensive medication . Subject know contraindication ACE inhibitor ( e.g. , ACEinduced cough , angioedema negative renal effect ) , blocker treatment . Hyperkalemia history hyperkalemia result either Type IV RTA ( renal tubular acidosis ) previous ACEi therapy . Is female childbearing potential . NOTE : Female subject postmenopausal ( i.e. , menstrual period minimum 12 month prior Screening ) surgically sterilize eligible study . If judge appropriate , postmenopausal woman may require document negative urine pregnancy test . Subject malignant ( accelerate ) hypertension , history malignant hypertension , secondary form hypertension . Subject mean sit SBP =180 mmHg . Subject advance hypertensive retinopathy ( Keith Wagner Grade IV ) . Subject Type 1 diabetes mellitus , Type 2 HbA1c ≥9 % Screening . Subject uncorrected primary obstructive severe regurgitative valvular disease , nondilated ( restrictive ) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . Subject follow condition : uncontrollable symptomatic arrhythmia unstable angina angina treat betablocker sick sinus syndrome second third degree heart block ( unless treat permanent , function pacemaker ) bradycardia ( sit heart rate &lt; 55 bpm ) history myocardial infarction stroke within 3 month Screening Subject atrial fibrillation . Subject Congestive Heart Failure NYHA ( New York Heart Association ) class IIIV [ The Criteria Committee New York Heart Association , 1994 ] . Current clinical evidence asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( e.g. , severe emphysema chronic bronchitis ) require long term use inhale oral bronchodilator steroid drug therapy ; also subject history bronchospastic disease undergo active therapy , investigator 's opinion , treatment study medication could provoke bronchospasm ; requirement anticipate treatment beta2 agonist therapy ( e.g. , albuterol [ Ventolin , Proventil ] , metaproterenol [ Alupent ] , pirbuterol [ Maxair ] , terbutaline [ Brethaire ] , isoetharine [ Bronkosol ] , Levalbuterol [ Xopenex ] ) . Subject evidence follow clinically significant disease could impair absorption , metabolism , excretion orallyadministered medication : renal disease define estimate Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) &lt; 30mL/min per 1.73 m2 hepatic disease ( i.e. , ALT AST level great three time upper limit normal range , history hepatic impairment , clinical assessment ) chronic biliary disorder gastric bypass surgery Subject endocrine disorder affect blood pressure ( e.g. , pheochromocytoma , active untreated hypo hyperthyroidism ) . Subject systemic disease , include cancer , reduce ( &lt; 12 month ) life expectancy . Subject use investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede Screening . Subject history psychological illness/condition would interfere ability understand complete requirement study . Subject condition , opinion Investigator and/or GSK Medical Monitor , place subject unacceptable risk participant trial . Subject receive ongoing treatment anticipate receive treatment follow medication treatment double blind study medication : antihypertensive medication except assign study medication . This would include alpha blocker medication may use treat hypertension condition unrelated hypertension ; monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitor ; Class I III antiarrhythmic ; beta2agonists .</criteria>
