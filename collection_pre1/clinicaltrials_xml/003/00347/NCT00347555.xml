	<brief_summary>Malaria illness cause parasite ( animal plant live host ) enter human body bite infected mosquito . The purpose study find safety experimental malaria vaccine whether vaccine cause human produce antibody ( protein make body 's immune system help control prevent infection ) . Four strengths vaccine test . The low strength vaccine test next high strength test . Each dosage ( shot ) vaccine give 18 people 4 dosage group Day 0 , 1 month 6 month . Two people dosage group receive injection placebo ( contains medication ) . Participants include 80 healthy adult 18 40 year age . Multiple blood draw occur duration study . Participants involve study related procedure approximately 13 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity EBA-175 RII-NG Malaria Vaccine Administered Intramuscularly</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study phase I , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , dosage-escalation study safety immunogenicity EBA-175 RII-NG malaria vaccine administer intramuscularly . The vaccine recombinant Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 kDa Region II-nonglycosylated ( EBA-175 RII-NG ) adsorb aluminum phosphate adjuvant . The study conduct Baylor College Medicine , Houston , Texas . Eighty healthy subject , age 18 40 year , male female , recruit Houston , Texas , participate study approximately 13 month . Subjects randomize receive 3 dos vaccine saline placebo intramuscular route 9:1 ratio 0 , 1 6 month . The safety immunogenicity ascend dosage vaccine assess . Eighteen subject receive vaccine follow dosage level : 5 , 20 , 80 160 microgram . Two subject receive placebo dosage level . Dosage escalation proceed review 2-week safety data 2 initial dos prior dosage level . The primary study objective ass safety reactogenicity ( tolerability ) ascend dosage EBA-175 RII-NG vaccine among healthy subject give 3 intramuscular dos 0 , 1 6 month . The secondary study objective evaluate immunogenicity EBA-175 RII-NG vaccine measure anti-EBA-175 RII-NG antibody use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , anti-parasite antibody indirect fluorescence antibody test ( IFAT ) , inhibition bind EBA-175 RII-NG red blood cell ( RBCs ) , inhibition Pf growth vitro .</detailed_description>

Current recent ( within last 4 week ) treatment parenteral , inhaled , oral corticosteroid ( intranasal steroid acceptable ) , immunosuppressive agent , chemotherapy . History splenectomy . Abnormal screen laboratory value . Any abnormal screening value screen test , except reticulocyte count ( even subsequent test value within normal range ) exclude subject study . An exception rule glucose measurement . Random plasma glucose measure subject screen visit . Values high 109 mg/dl confirm repeat fast glucose measurement .

Positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) . Concurrent participation investigational protocol receipt investigational product within previous 30 day . Identification condition , opinion investigator , would affect ability subject understand comply study protocol would jeopardize safety right subject participate study . History malignancy , include hematologic skin cancer , know immunodeficiency syndrome . History malaria infection receipt malaria vaccine . History travel malariaendemic area receipt antimalarial prophylaxis past 12 month . Planned travel malariaendemic area course study .
