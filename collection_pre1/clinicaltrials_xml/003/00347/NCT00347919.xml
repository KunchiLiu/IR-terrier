Histologically confirm invasive breast cancer incurable stage IIIb , stage IIIc T4 lesion , stage IV disease primary diagnosis relapse curativeintent surgery . No prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy antiErbB1/ErbB2 therapy metastatic recurrent disease ( neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy ) . Prior hormonal therapy ( e.g. , tamoxifen , raloxifen aromatase inhibitor ) advance metastatic disease permit provide least 2 week elapse completion prior therapy start study drug . Note : Subjects must document progressive disease ( PD ) intolerant hormonal therapy . This must document source documentation . Prior neoadjuvant therapy and/or adjuvant therapy permit . Note : ( ) Subjects receive neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy must least 6 month completion chemotherapycomponent adjuvant therapy start study drug ( ) ( b ) Subjects receive adjuvant therapy must least 6 month completion chemotherapycomponent adjuvant therapy start study drug ( ) ( c ) Subjects receive neoadjuvant therapy must least 6 month completion neoadjuvant therapy start study drug ( ) ( ) Subjects receive trastuzumab hormonal agent part adjuvant therapy eligible provide : ( 1 ) 2 week elapse since last dose ( 2 ) 6 month elapse start trastuzumab hormonal therapy start study drug . Radiotherapy prior initiation randomize therapy limited area ( e.g. , palliative treatment painful disease ) sole site measurable assessable disease allow however , subject must complete treatment least 4 week prior start study drug , must recover treatmentrelated toxicity prior start pazopanib and/or lapatinib . Documented amplification ErbB2 Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization ( FISH ) either primary metastatic tumor tissue . Archived tumor tissue must provide ErbB2 FISH test central laboratory , use determine eligibility . Note : Subjects document ErbB2 amplification base prior FISH test document ErbB2 overexpression base prior immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) value 3+ eligible , however , archive tumor tissue must provide confirmation central laboratory . If result prior test confirmed central laboratory , subject continue receive study drug ( ) discretion investigator , exclude statistical analysis . Archived tumor tissue ( paraffinembedded ) must available correlate tumor response intratumoral genetic change well expression level relevant biomarkers . Results biomarkers use determine subject eligibility study . Ability swallow retain oral medication . Disease must measurable accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Subjects must choose treatment lapatinib and/or pazopanib initial treatment initial treatment ( cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens trastuzumab single agent ) locally advanced metastatic disease . Adequate organ function define : System ( Laboratory Values ) Hematologic : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ( ≥1.5 X 109/L ) Platelets ( ≥100 X 109/L ) Hepatic : Albumin ( ≥2.5 g/dL ) Serum bilirubin ( ≤1.5 X upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless due Gilbert 's syndrome ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ( ≤2.0 X ULN ) Renal : Calculated creatinine clearance1 ( ≥50 mL/min ) Urine Protein2 ( Negative , trace +1 dipstick urinalysis &lt; 1.0 gram determine 24 hour urine protein analysis ) . A patient first screen dipstick urinalysis . If urine protein dipstick analysis is≥2+ , 24hour urine protein must assess 24 hour urine protein must &lt; 1 g protein eligible . Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram . Multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan accepted case echocardiogram perform inconclusive MUGA scan accept standard . Subjects know history uncontrolled symptomatic angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure eligible . A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , physiologically incapable become pregnant ) , include female : A hysterectomy A bilateral oophorectomy ( ovariectomy ) A bilateral tubal ligation Is postmenopausal ( total cessation menses ≥1 year ) Childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test within 2 week first dose study medication , agree use adequate contraception study participation minimum 2 menstrual cycle last dose study medication . GSK acceptable contraceptive method , use consistently accordance product label instruction physician , follow : An intrauterine device document failure rate le 1 % per year . Vasectomized partner sterile prior female subject 's entry sole sexual partner female . Complete abstinence sexual intercourse 14 day exposure investigation product , clinical trial , least 2 menstrual cycle last dose investigational product . Doublebarrier contraception ( condom spermicidal jelly , foam suppository , film ; diaphragm spermicide ; male condom diaphragm spermicide ) . Oral contraceptive reliable due potential drugdrug interaction . Subjects must complete screen assessment outline protocol . Subjects must provide write informed consent prior performance studyspecific procedures assessment willing comply treatment followup . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Subjects bilateral breast cancer bone metastases disease site . Patients high disease burden define &gt; 30 % replacement hepatic parenchyma metastasis , symptomatic pulmonary metastasis ( e.g. , clinically significant dyspnea , cough , chest pain attributable pulmonary metastasis ) , &gt; 3 visceral organ tumor involvement . History malignancy . Subjects diseasefree 5 year , subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . Sarcoma histology . Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation include ( 1 ) unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug , ( 2 ) serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety , obtain informed consent compliance study . History clinical evidence central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases leptomeningeal carcinomatosis , except individual previously treat CNS metastasis , asymptomatic , requirement steroid antiseizure medication ³ 2 month prior study enrollment . Routine screen CNS image study ( compute tomography [ CT ] magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] ) require clinically indicated subject history CNS metastases . Malabsorption Syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . Active peptic ulcer disease , inflammatory bowel disease , gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation ; history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 4 week prior begin therapy . Presence uncontrolled infection . Concurrent cancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , surgery , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy , tumor embolization ) . Concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial . Use investigational anticancer drug within 30 day 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose pazopanib and/or lapatinib . Prior use investigational licensed drug target either vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGF receptor , ErbB2 ( except trastuzumab use neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting ) . Known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate pazopanib lapatinib . Has taken/is take prohibited medication , Lapatinibrelated , orPazopanibrelated . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) prolongation define QTc interval &gt; 480 msec . History one follow cardiac condition within past 6 month : Cardiac angioplasty stenting Myocardial infarction Unstable angina History cerebrovascular accident within past 6 month . Poorly control hypertension ( systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥140mmHg , diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) ≥90mmHg ) . Note : Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study entry . The blood pressure ( BP ) must reassess two occasion separate minimum 24 hour . The mean SBP/DBP value BP assessment must &lt; 140/90mmHg order subject eligible study . Presence nonhealing wound , fracture , ulcer , presence symptomatic peripheral vascular disease . Evidence bleed diathesis coagulopathy . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 4 week prior begin therapy , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study ; minor surgical procedure fine needle aspiration core biopsy within 1 week prior begin therapy also exclude . Pregnant lactate female . Has Class III IV heart failure define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional classification system . History untreated deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) within past 6 month ( e.g . calf vein thrombosis ) .</criteria>
