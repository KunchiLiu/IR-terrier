	<brief_title>US 10 mL Biologic Lung Volume Reduction ( BLVR ) Phase 1 Emphysema Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emphysema progressive , debilitate disease affect nearly 3 million people United States roughly one percent US population . The disease characterize destruction lung tissue result inflammation cause exposure noxious inhaled agent extend period . The common cause condition cigarette smoking , although genetic occupational cause account 10 % case . Despite aggressive public health initiative aim discourage use cigarette , smoking-related lung disease remain significant cause disability death United States . Currently 46 million smoker US . Due number current new smoker , emphysema expect remain leading cause morbidity mortality United States year come . Aeris develop novel bronchoscopic system achieve benefit lung volume reduction without surgery . The Biologic Lung Volume Reduction ( BLVR ) System , new investigational therapy emphysema , intend reduce lung volume period week collapse promote remodel diseased area lung . The result reduction lung volume intend restore normal physiological relationship lung chest wall , improve breathe exercise capacity alleviate symptom chronic dyspnea . This study evaluate safety BLVR System patient advance emphysema .</detailed_description>
