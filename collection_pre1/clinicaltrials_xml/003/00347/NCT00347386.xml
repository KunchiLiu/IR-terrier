Several hypothesis examine clinical trial . The primary objective measure , double blind randomize controlled trial , efficacy give 2 RDA ( Required Daily Allowance 10 mg ) zinc orally addition routine antibiotic , treatment possible serious bacterial infection infant &gt; = 7 day 4 month age reduce proportion treatment failure time discharge hospital .

Young infant possible serious bacterial infection fulfil inclusion criterion enrol study stratify 4 group basis weight age ' z ' score &lt; -2 z &gt; =- 2 z whether he/she diarrhea . Within stratum subject randomize receive zinc placebo . Treatment failure define need change initial antibiotic therapy . The minimum duration monitoring till clinical recovery ( use predetermine criterion ) . Serum copper , serum ferritin serum transferrin receptor determine enrollment , 72 hour enrollment discharge hospital . Concentrations CRP procalcitonin measure baseline , 72 hour enrolment clinical recovery . Documentation efficacy addition zinc standard therapy may provide simple low-cost strategy improve survival serious infection young infant . This likely significant impact infant morbidity mortality . It good example use simple immunomodulator beneficially improve child health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infant mortality rate continue high develop country despite advance child health care . Infections important cause deaths infant . There increase recognition nutritional deficiency include micronutrient important determinant infection outcomes . Zinc crucial micronutrient influence various immune mechanism modulate host resistance several pathogen . Supplementation zinc document provide protection common childhood infection . It also show benefit adjunct therapy infection like diarrhea pneumonia old child . Given predisposition young infant develop country zinc deficiency infection , addition zinc standard treatment serious bacterial infection may lead significant improvement outcomes . This critical demonstrate nearly 80 % infant mortality occur first 2 month life . The infant mortality rate India continue excess 60 per 1000 live birth . Neonatal mortality contribute 64 % infant death particularly bear low birth weight . Most deaths occur second third month . Serious systemic infection like sepsis pneumonia constitute 30-40 % cause mortality . Any health programme aim reduce infant mortality rate need address mortality first two month life . Almost 90 % low birth weight ( LBW ) baby born develop country , particularly Indian subcontinent . Nearly 70 % small gestational age unlike developed world bulk low birth weight baby preterms . Zinc deficiency fetal development document cause intra-uterine growth retardation also impair postnatal immune function make baby susceptible severe infection . Studies show good correlation cord blood zinc , maternal zinc concentration birth weight . The zinc content breast milk decrease rapidly birth . In addition , requirement likely high young infant develop country live high microbial load environment expose recurrent infection . Further , malnourish infant need zinc catch growth . All predispose develop zinc deficiency infection . In population base study group last year , nearly 40 % young infant low plasma zinc despite breast-fed , probably reflection inadequate tissue store ( unpublished data ) . Zinc influence many aspect immune system start effect barrier various component innate acquire immunity . There sufficient data animal human study increase host susceptibility infection zinc deficiency . A vicious cycle infection zinc deficiency exist . Infection reduce plasma zinc concentration , reflect severity infection inflammation . This may observe early illness . Organs skin , thymus , bone epithelium also become depleted process . Severe bacterial illness also lead zinc redistribution . It plausible redistribution increase infection severity . There limited data therapeutic effect zinc supplementation severe infection young infant le 4 month age . A short inexpensive course zinc patient serious bacterial infection become simple potent intervention reduce young infant mortality morbidity . While effect zinc deficiency supplementation reasonably well document eventually benefit clinical outcome alone result application .</detailed_description>
