	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial find whether combination NOV-002 chemotherapy ( paclitaxel carboplatin ) well improve overall survival time compare chemotherapy alone people non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Earlier clinical trial NSCLC show patient treat NOV-002 combination chemotherapy well response ( tumor get small one United States Phase 1/2 trial ) patient receive chemotherapy alone ; two Phase 2 trial do Russian patient , end one year , patient treat NOV-002 chemotherapy well survival rate patient receive NOV-002 chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study NOV-002 Combination With Chemotherapy Treat Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NSCLC widespread disease extremely high mortality morbidity . Even widely accept standard care chemotherapy advance NSCLC , platinum-based doublet , palliative , provide marginal efficacy measure survival . In addition , chemotherapy accompany severe , sometimes life-threatening , toxicity often limit application . Thus , clear need new , effective safer therapy advance NSCLC . In Phase 2 trial , NOV-002 demonstrate high response rate improve survival compare chemotherapy alone patient advance NSCLC , well-tolerated patient group . Thus , conduct large Phase 3 trial NOV-002 good define clinical profile potential benefit advance NSCLC patient . The overall design Phase 3 trial reflect major element previous Russian US clinical trial advance NSCLC - open label , randomize control trial compare NOV-002 combination first-line chemotherapy ( paclitaxel + carboplatin ) first-line chemotherapy alone . Furthermore , design powered pivotal , registrational trial , sufficient approval . As primary efficacy endpoint , Phase 3 trial aim demonstrate combination NOV-002 paclitaxel carboplatin result improve overall survival compare paclitaxel carboplatin alone . In addition , several secondary efficacy endpoint assess , include progression free survival , tumor response rate duration response , quality life , myelosuppression immunomodulation . Overall survival chosen primary endpoint trial context FDA ( Draft ) Guidance ( `` Clinical Trial Endpoints Approval Cancer Drugs Biologics '' , April 2005 ) . This Guidance indicate improvement overall survival evaluate randomize controlled trial unquestioned clinical benefit . It indicate endpoint precise easy measure , document date death , state bias factor endpoint measurement , blind essential . This Phase 3 randomize , control , open-label trial thus conform Guidance .</detailed_description>
