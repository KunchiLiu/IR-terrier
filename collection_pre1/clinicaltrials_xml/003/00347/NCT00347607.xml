	<brief_title>Study Three Alternatives Mass Treatment Trachoma Villages Tanzania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An important component trachoma control program effective use antibiotic , particularly azithromycin , reduce pool chlamydial ocular infection community . A reduction pool infection reduce likelihood transmission , couple effective hygiene environmental change , theoretically lead reduction disease point active trachoma longer public health problem . Our previous experience use azithromycin community treatment show even high rate coverage , hyperendemic community start experience re-emergent trachoma follow treatment one year . Therefore , urgent determine another treatment strategy village keep pool infection low , eventually eliminated.A combination approach consist mass treatment yearly interval surveillance target treatment approach interim period may effective maintain low rate re-emergent disease.We propose test cost-effectiveness three alternative strategy frequency provision azithromycin , context Tanzanian National Trachoma Control Program . The strategy develop build epidemiological knowledge trachoma area , locally appropriate term feasibility personnel , consistent goal enhance community control program . A total nine village Kongwa district Tanzania randomize one three group ( total three village per group ) . The nine village , active trachoma rate pre-school child 50 % great , would slat enrollment National Program , currently receive treatment . Surveys active trachoma status would carry 300 randomly select , child age 1-7 year ( pre-school ) village baseline , 6 month post mass treatment , one , two , three year post baseline . The following treatment strategy use : Control village : Usual practice : The three village randomize arm would receive mass treatment community year part Tanzania National Trachoma Control program . Intervention 1 . Usual practice plus community surveillance TI case treatment 6 month : The three village randomize arm would receive mass treatment , similar usual practice arm , addition , would cadre community volunteer , train recognize TI . They screen neighborhood , examine pre-school child mother , arrange health worker another round treatment TI case family 6 month , 18 month post baseline . Intervention 2 : Usual practice plus community surveillance TI case treatment every 4 month : The three village randomize arm would approach identical intervention 1 , surveillance treatment TI case 4 8 month instead 6 months.For second year , would surveillance treatment 6 month . Cost data community surveillance treatment program collect throughout first year . Analyses focus additional benefit reduction prevalence trachoma , ocular C. trachomatis infection , one , two , three year two alternative strategy , relative yearly mass treatment alone , cost-effectiveness three strategy .</detailed_description>
