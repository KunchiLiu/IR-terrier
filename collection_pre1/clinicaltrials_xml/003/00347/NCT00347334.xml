	<brief_summary>The term torticollis Latin `` twist neck '' . It cause tightness sternocleidomastoid muscle manifest head tilt neck rotation opposite side . Treatment include comprehensive physical therapy program . Torticollis typically present within first three month life . Currently research infant conclude physical therapy stretch program effective majority cases.1 The study determine positioning time correlate rate recovery . Overall incidence torticollis increase dramatically since inception back sleep program 1994.2 The back sleep program educational awareness program promote family place infant sleep back reduce risk sudden infant death . The increase use semi-upright positioning equipment prior developmental head control may also contribute increase . Families place baby semi-upright position ie . car seat swing prior developmental head control . Head control typically emerge three month age . Unfortunately use position device occurs prior child reach third month birthday . The specific aim study include measure rate recovery infant torticollis . Recovery define achieve full neck rotation head tilt . The length time spend developmental position position equipment belly lie , side lying , semi-upright sitting also monitor record . No specific position prescribe ; study monitor position . Treatment initiated upon referral Cleveland Clinic Children 's Hospital physical therapy evaluation . Baseline cervical rotation lateral tilt assess . Families train regard home stretch program ask diary home positioning time . Routine plan care continue minimum every week full active range motion achieve . At visit cervical range motion determine well parent report regard home positioning time . Recovery define full active range motion , head tilt , symmetrical head right reaction . Post recovery analysis recovery rate position time do assess correlation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is Home Positioning Time Associated With Torticollis Rate Recovery ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Torticollis come Latin , '' torti '' meaning twist `` collis '' mean neck.1 Torticollis tightening sternocleidomastoid ( SCM ) muscle result head tilt involve side rotation opposite side . The condition present birth first 2 month life time infant ' neck muscle develop . There three clinical group torticollis- 1. palpable SCM tumor 2. muscular SCM- tighten thicken SCM 3. postural torticollis - posturing tightness tumor 2 The cause torticollis may include damage shorten SCM possibly due : utero position ie . lack space traumatic birth multiple birth therefore limit space low amniotic fluid Current physical therapy referral torticollis increase dramatically perhaps due increase multiple birth , infant size premature birth . Graham state back sleep program initiate 1994 result epidemic plagiocephaly positional torticollis estimate 1 300 1 60.3 In addition increase use infant seat place child semi-upright posture age developmental head control . Current research establish physical therapy effective 90 % case . The treatment correlate severity restriction presence tumor.4 The role home positioning address torticollis research . A community education program promote awareness limit time semi-upright position ie . could help decrease surge torticollis . The study significance establish home positioning time correlate rate recovery Torticollis . Does position child semi-upright improve recovery rate ? Can establish well physical therapy intervention ? This improve quality physical therapy care . Specific Aims : At point physical therapy research intervention Torticollis focus stretch program . This study determine home position correlate torticollis rate recovery . The hypothesis determine relationship developmental position rate recovery Torticollis . Does home positioning affect recovery ? Recovery determine time achieve full active range motion symmetrical head control measure goniometer . The aim include measure Torticollis recovery time , document neck movement use goniometer , standardized physical therapy measurement tool . As well record home positioning parent report . All participant consent prior treatment . Experimental Design Methods : A prospective observational design study determine : Is home positioning time associate torticollis rate recovery ? Infants torticollis diagnosis , six month age young , refer Cleveland Clinic Children 's Hospital eligible study obtain sample 150 child . A marketing campaign locale physician educate regard study existence four satellite location . The study explore relationship home positioning time recovery rate . Infants follow minimum every week assess active passive neck trunk range motion , head neck control include strength right reaction . Parents diary report weekly time spend developmental posture : back , side belly , semi-upright posture ie . infant car seat . Postures advance developmental age sit . Physical therapy intervention weekly session include routine plan care : stretching neck trunk strengthen neck trunk kineseotaping neck trunk Parent education regard home stretch environmental adaptation Massage/Soft tissue mobilization myofascial release head trunk Environmental adaptation encourage child look opposite Orthotic management - Tot collar use Protocols tap stretch follow . A tubular orthosis Torticollis ( TOT collar ) utilize 4.5 month head tilt still present age . Once full passive range motion achieve treatment progress address active range motion , strengthen well postural asymmetry . A standardized torticollis assessment , plan care weekly note use clinician documentation . Staff train occur prior initiation study quarterly throughout study . These training videotape clinician require view prior treatment . Plagiocephaly often accompany infant torticollis . Referral craniofacial physician helmeting consultation occur 6 month age indicate . Plagiocephaly flatten head due asymmetrical resting posture infant . Plagiocephaly define great 4mm cross sectional difference . Recovery define : 1 . Full symmetrical active range motion neck , trunk extremity measure goniometry per Norkin.5 2 . 80* active cervical rotation supine , prone , sit stance measure goniometry . 3 . Active midline trunk head alignment static dynamic activity 4 . Symmetrical right equilibrium reaction . 5 . Symmetrical antigravity head trunk strength measure manual muscle strength test Hoppenfeld.6 Data : The primary outcome variable rate recovery define length time recovery initial assessment . Positioning time spend developmental posture : belly , back , semi-upright sit . Other parameter document : age parent , birth weight , birth order , multiple birth : yes , plagiocephaly , helmet use TOT collar use . Data cod record Excel spreadsheet . Reports record aggregately . Statistical method : We assess relationship recovery time position time position use Pearson 's correlation coefficient non-parametric Spearman rank correlation coefficient necessary . We use multiple linear regression model ass relationship adjust baseline treatment factor birth order , plagiocephaly TOT collar use . All test two-tailed performed significance level 0.05 . All analysis perform use SAS 9.1 software ( SAS institute , Cary NC ) Sample Size : With 150 subject anticipate , great 90 % power detect correlation coefficient least 0.30 . Inclusion/Exclusion : A full medical assessment necessary rule associate anomaly hip dysplasia , vertebral anomaly due syndromes ie . Down 's syndrome . A secondary diagnosis often associate torticollis plagiocephaly . Asymetrical resting posture often result flatten head ( plagiocephaly ) . This may cause progressive cranial asymmetry . In case plagiocephaly require helmeting apply pressure reshape infant head . Children vertebral anomaly exclude ; child plagiocephaly include . Treatment torticollis primarily include physical therapy intervention . Ninety percent case respond physical therapy . In severe case six month stretch program still remain great 15* head tilt aggressive treatment may indicate . Other intervention include Botulinum Toxin injection weaken muscle possibly surgery lengthen muscle.4 Exclusion criterion include : treatment initiate another facility medical complication interfere treatment surgery radiology result vertebral anomaly , ocular imbalance nerve injury treatment initiate six month age previous BOTOX cervical manipulation client attend daycare full time compliance le 80 % schedule session . Study procedure : Participants receive routine plan care . Additional procedure require participant include complete diary/questionnaire regard home positioning .
