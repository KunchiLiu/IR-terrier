	<brief_title>Study RADPLAT Tarceva Locally Advanced Head Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma ( SCCA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Head neck malignancy represent group epidermoid tumor arise epithelial lining mouth , pharynx , larynx . Three modality therapy establish role treatment carcinoma head neck : chemotherapy , radiation therapy ( XRT ) , surgery . The choice modality depend upon many factor site extent primary lesion , likelihood complete surgical resection , presence lymph node metastasis , etc . Traditionally , small lesion ( stage T1-T2 ) effectively treat either , surgical excision irradiation whereas advance disease ( stage III-IV ) treat combined surgery XRT . The subsequent morbidity relate extensive surgery major problem among survivor . Clearly , need develop therapeutic strategy patient advanced head neck cancer effective approach employ non-surgical modality . Our hypothesis head neck cancer resistant apoptosis DNA damage induce radiation chemotherapy . This resistance mediate EGFR overexpression result downstream activation cell survival signal , AKT , may overcome Erlotinib ( Tarceva ) co-administered RADiation cisPLATin ( intraarterial chemotherapy ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm Stage IIIIV disease comprise T3 T4 N02 lesions oral cavity , oropharynx , hypopharynx , larynx . No previous radiation therapy chemotherapy . No evidence distant metastatic disease . Age &gt; 18 . Karnofsky performance status &gt; 60 ( ECOG 2 ) . ANC &gt; 1000 , platelets &gt; 100,000 , calculate 24hour creatinine clearance &gt; 60 . Studyspecific inform consent form . Protocol treatment must begin &lt; 8 week diagnostic biopsy . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients surgically cure secondary malignancy disease free &gt; 5 year eligible . Radiologic evidence bone destruction . Previous concurrent head neck primary . Prior surgery study site biopsy . Patients receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study treatment agents potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . History prior concomitant malignancy ( carcinoma situ cervix , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin ) .</criteria>
