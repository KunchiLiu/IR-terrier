	<detailed_description>Streptococcus pneumoniae ( pneumococcus ) common cause pneumonia lead hospitalization adult . Resistance infection generally think highly associate antibody capsular polysaccharide ( CPS ) . Most people develop pneumococcal pneumonia lack antibody capsule infect type . We previously show person develop infection despite presence antibody capsular polysaccharide infect type . When antibody find , tend poorly functional ( DM Musher et al , J Infect Dis 182:158-167 , 2000 ) opsonize pneumococci poorly phagocytosis human white blood cell vitro , protect mice poorly challenge infect organism . About 20 % patient pneumococcal pneumonia previous study vaccinate vaccine currently use adult , namely 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine ( Pneumovax [ Merck ] ) . This product consist purified capsular polysaccharide 23 different serotypes S. pneumoniae . During past two year , active vaccination program hospital , proportion pneumococcal pneumonia patient vaccinate increased 60 % . Clearly , vaccine provide full degree protection . After many year study , include one involve nearly 40,000 child Kaiser Permanent health care system , new form pneumococcal vaccine release . In vaccine , Prevnar [ Wyeth-Lederle ] , capsular polysaccharide 7 common pneumococcal type conjugate protein closely resemble diphtheria toxoid . There suggestion Prevnar stimulate antibody subject fail respond Pneumovax ( DM Musher et al , Clin Infect Dis 27:1487-1490 , 1998 ) also result antibody may effectively opsonize bacteria phagocytosis . We propose focus present research person develop pneumococcal pneumonia , group regard high risk reinfection . Persons recover pneumococcal pneumonia randomize vaccination revaccination Pneumovax vaccination Prevnar . These study clarify whether administration protein conjugate pneumococcal vaccine stimulates antibody patient pneumonia fail respond prior vaccination stimulates well functional antibody previously respond antibody poorly functional . Our laboratory others show Prevnar successfully immunize adult ( Ahmed et al , J Infect Dis 173:83-90 , 1996 ) . The vaccine officially recommend adult antibody level Prevnar Pneumovax . Such antibody may functional ; yet determine . Prevnar contain 7 antigen whereas Pneumovax contain 23 antigen ; thus , would less desirable , general , administer vaccine instead Pneumovax . However , patient develop pneumonia despite received Pneumovax , conjugate vaccine may offer opportunity stimulate production effective antibody . In proposed research , participant eventually receive Pneumovax Prevnar .</detailed_description>
