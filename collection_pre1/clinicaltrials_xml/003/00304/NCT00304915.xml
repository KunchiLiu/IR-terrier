	<detailed_description>Background : Depression common mental disorder HIV infect patient . Despite availability efficacious treatment depression , evidence suggest under-diagnosed under-treated routine HIV care . To address problem , investigator adapt implement collaborative stepped-care model depression treatment HIV clinic . This proposal build past success TIDES/WAVES program use VA primary care . The project ( HI-TIDES HIV Translating Initiatives Depression Effective Solutions ) implement primary care collaborative care model depression treatment HIV clinic use evidence-based implementation strategy . Objectives : The objective proposal : 1 ) Develop evaluate process adapting , implement , sustain collaborative care depression VA HIV clinic , 2 ) Compare quality depression care clinical effectiveness HI-TIDES usual care HIV clinic , 3 ) Evaluate cost-effectiveness patient assign HI-TIDES relative patient assign usual care HIV clinic . Methods : The implementation framework proposal primarily inform Rogers diffusion innovation model , Simpson Transfer Model , PRECEDE model . The VA American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines inform step care collaborative model intervention source document summarize evidence depression treatment general population . An expert panel convene rate quality available evidence depression treatment context HIV . Patients recruit VA HIV clinic : Little Rock , Atlanta , Houston . The intervention randomize level patient . The investigator expect recruit total 140 intervention 140 usual care patient . Patients intervention group support depression collaborative care team include depression nurse care manager , clinical pharmacist , psychiatrist . The depression nurse care manager evaluate depression symptom severity , antidepressant side effect , depression HIV medication adherence every two week phone acute phase treatment record result VA electronic medical record . After 50 % improvement depression severity , intervention subject move continuation phase treatment patient contact every four week depression nurse case manager . A formative evaluation occur start-up throughout implementation intervention . A summative evaluation document effectiveness cost-effectiveness intervention use intent treat analysis plan . Findings : No result time . Status : Start-up activity . Impact : The propose study highly relevant VA Veterans serve many reason . First , majority VA patient HIV see primary care clinic therefore benefit VA 's effort primary care setting improve depression identification treatment . Second , addition negative outcome depression generally , depression HIV patient associate additional negative outcome include accelerated HIV disease progression , decrease immune system functioning , premature death . Third , directly move collaborative depression care primary care clinic HIV clinic likely fail several reason include comorbidities associate depressed HIV patient potential drug-drug interaction . The propose project address gap provide effectiveness cost-effectiveness analysis inform decision large scale implementation HI-TIDES intervention .</detailed_description>
