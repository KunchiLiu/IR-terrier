	<brief_title>Whole-Body 18F-FDG PET Induction Chemotherapeutic Response Advanced NPC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order improve locoregional control eradicate micrometastases patient locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) , induction chemotherapy follow concurrent chemoradiotherapy prefer therapeutic approach.Although would great advantage identify non-responder immediately therapy formulate alternative treatment strategy , non-invasive method early evaluation therapeutic response advance NPC patient fully evaluate . Decrease tumor volume anatomical image relief symptom clinical follow-up use many conventional approach evaluate effectiveness therapy . However , effective therapy could well result early subclinical alteration tumor physiology biochemistry . These alteration may occur long change tumor mass become apparent . Thus therapeutic effect may assess accurately use conventional anatomical imaging study , CT MRI.Recent study show 18F-FDG PET , whole-body image technology base glucose metabolism , effectively detect subclinical clinical therapeutic response stage earlier detect conventional approaches.We therefore propose conduct prospective study evaluate therapeutic response use 18F-FDG PET induction chemotherapy locally advance NPC patient .</detailed_description>
