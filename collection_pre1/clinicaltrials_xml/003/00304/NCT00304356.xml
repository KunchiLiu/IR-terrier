	<brief_title>Compassionate Use Nitazoxanide Treatment Clostridium Difficile Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile lead cause nosocomial diarrheal disease associate antibiotic therapy . This debilitate condition substantial morbidity mortality may around 2-3 % . There enormous increase disease VA Medical Center past two year , occur hospital throughout United States . Currently recommend therapy condition metronidazole , give orally . About 15-20 % patient fail respond initial therapy metronidazole , another 20 % relapse treatment . Relapses may treat another course metronidazole ; one-half respond therapy . The failure treat oral vancomycin , drug also failure rate 10-20 % . There , present , accept therapy ( although article literature favor vancomycin ingest bacteria benign specie ) . Furthermore , strong risk emergence resistant bacteria hospitalize patient treated oral vancomycin . Nitazoxanide FDA approve drug market U.S. widely use throughout world treat parasitic disease gastrointestinal tract ; several million child treat drug past decade . Nitazoxanide approve antiprotozoal agent oral administration pediatric patient , age 1 11 , diarrhea . The drug act interfere anaerobic metabolic pathway , show excellent vitro activity C. difficile . We hypothesize drug safe effective alternative patient diarrheal disease cause C. difficile . The IRB approve double-blind protocol compare metronidazole nitazoxanide , treat total 16 patient far protocol . In IRB-approved double blind study ( design , two third subject randomize nitazoxanide ) , patient appear good response rate -- good , fact , think nitazoxanide may better drug treat infection either metronidazole vancomycin .</detailed_description>
