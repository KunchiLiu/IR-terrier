	<brief_summary>Insights cause kidney failure emerge research , less know epidemiology less severe form kidney disease know chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) chronic renal insufficiency ( CRI ) . The Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort ( CRIC ) Study establish study consequence CKD particular focus cardiovascular illness like myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) stroke . The CRIC Study identify high-risk subgroup individual CRI , inform future treatment trial , development preventive therapy . CRIC observational study date , 3612 participant enrol CRIC cohort . The goal Phase III enroll 1500 new participant across seven Clinical center ( 214 new participant per center ) . Participants previously enrol follow additional 5 year newly recruit participant follow additional 5 year . Principles underlie targeted composition cohort new recruit similar Phase I recruit , however modification list eligibility summary . No study treatment intervention give participant CRIC . Subjects include racially ethnically diverse group adult age 45 79 year old broad spectrum renal disease severity proteinuria level . Participants 65 year old undergo additional testing assess physical cognitive function , social support , quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible men woman consent enrol observational study . Participants remain care usual physician . Questionnaires complete test conduct provide information aspect kidney heart health status . Participants screen course brief visit inform consent obtain , height weight measure , blood drawn form complete . If eligible , participant return center extensive visit . At Baseline Visit follow occur : - eligibility confirm - weight , height , waist body water fat content measure Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis ( BIA ) - blood pressure heart rate record - information medical history medication use recently - blood draw ( ½ cup ) follow test : CBC ( Complete Blood Count ) , test metabolism , several heart kidney test - blood pressure leg arm calculate Ankle Brachial Index ( ABI ) - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) - urine sample collection 24-hour urine sample kidney function test - complete questionnaire quality life , diet , mood , think process physical activity - nail clip This visit take 3 4 hour . Participants contact telephone six month Baseline Visit ask recent medical event medication . Participants ask return center annual visit many procedure describe conduct .</detailed_description>
