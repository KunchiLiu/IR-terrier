	<brief_title>Vancomycin vs. Nitazoxanide Treat Recurrent C. Difficile Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile lead cause nosocomial diarrheal disease associate antibiotic therapy . This debilitate condition substantial morbidity mortality use say around 2-3 % , recently show u ( Clin Infect . Dis , July , 2005 ) others ( Pepin et al , Clin . Infect . Dis. , July , 2005 ) substantially high -- approximately 15-20 % . There enormous increase disease VA medical center past two year , occur hospital throughout United States develop world . Although orally administer vancomycin first drug approve treat C. difficile colitis , remain one official approval Food Drug Administration , currently recommend therapy condition metronidazole , give orally . This drug recommend : ( 1 ) cost vancomycin exceedingly high ; ( 2 ) concern vancomycin-resistant bacteria might appear hospital drug use treat large number patient ; ( 3 ) recommendation make time cure rate metronidazole think approach 100 % . We recently show 23 % patient fail respond initial therapy metronidazole , another 27 % relapse treatment ( Musher et al , Clin Infect Dis , July , 2005 ) . Others confirm observation ( Pepin et al , Clin Infect Dis , July 2005 ) . The option treat failure relapse limit . Another course metronidazole may cure one-half patient . Oral vancomycin may use , drug also failure rate 10-20 % concern use remain . Based background , become interested study nitazoxanide . This FDA approve drug , market United States widely use throughout world treat parasitic disease gastrointestinal tract ; several million child treat drug past decade . The drug act interfere anaerobic metabolic pathway , show excellent vitro activity C. difficile . We hypothesize drug safe effective alternative patient diarrheal disease cause C. difficile . The IRB approve double-blind protocol compare metronidazole nitazoxanide , complete trial . The result study favorable . A 10-day course oral nitazoxanide produce cure symptom 7 day 90 % cure without relapse 31 day 79 % compare 84 % 56 % , respectively , metronidazole . Because small number subject , difference statistically significant , result certainly appear promising . A manuscript submit Clin Infect Dis describe study . We propose compare nitazoxanide vancomycin group patient need alternative therapy , namely treated metronidazole fail recurrence disease initial response .</detailed_description>
