	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy together temozolomide may kill tumor cell . It yet know schedule temozolomide give together radiation therapy effective treating glioblastoma gliosarcoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study two different schedule temozolomide compare well work give together radiation therapy treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma gliosarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy ( RT ) Temozolomide ( TMZ ) Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma Gliosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine dose-intensifying ( increase `` dose-density '' ) adjuvant temozolomide component chemoradiation treatment enhance treatment efficacy measure overall survival patient newly diagnose glioblastoma gliosarcoma . Secondary - Determine dose-intensifying adjuvant temozolomide component chemoradiation treatment enhance treatment efficacy measure progression-free survival . - Determine patient unmethylated MGMT ( O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase ) dose-intensifying adjuvant temozolomide component chemoradiation treatment enhance treatment efficacy ( overall progression-free survival ) compare patient receive conventional temozolomide dosing . - Determine patient methylated MGMT dose-intensifying adjuvant temozolomide component chemoradiation treatment enhance treatment efficacy ( overall progression-free survival ) compare patient receive conventional temozolomide dosing . - Determine association tumor MGMT gene methylation status treatment response . - Compare record toxicities conventional dose-intense chemotherapy regimen . - Evaluate whether 6-month progression-free survival associate overall survival . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord recursive partitioning analysis class ( III vs IV v V ) , MGMT gene methylation status ( methylated vs nonmethylated v indeterminate ) , radiotherapy criterion use ( standard v revise European ) . Patients undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day per week 6 week . Patients also receive oral temozolomide daily radiotherapy . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Randomized treatment begin approximately 4 week completion radiotherapy . - Arm I : Patients receive oral temozolomide day 1-5 . - Arm II : Patients receive oral temozolomide day 1-21 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond disease may receive 6 course temozolomide . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month 2 year , every 6 month thereafter . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : This study require 750 patient randomized two treatment arm .</detailed_description>
