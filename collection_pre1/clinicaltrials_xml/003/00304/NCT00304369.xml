	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile major cause nosocomial infection . When organism proliferate colon , usually result prior antibiotic therapy hospitalize otherwise debilitated person , variety potentially serious consequence follow , fever , leukocytosis , abdominal pain , diarrhea ileus . Some patient require surgical exploration colectomy , hospital several death attributable C. difficile colitis past year . C. difficile colitis treat metronidazole , early literature subject , write 1980 's early 1990s , suggest response rate excellent , exceed 90-95 % . Our clinical observation suggest treatment metronidazole follow surprisingly high rate failure , perhaps 25-30 % . The clinical problem , present , desirable alternative . Vancomycin , give orally , say highly effective treat infection , may true , administration drug associate emergence vancomycin-resistant bacteria , major problem modern hospital . No drug approve treatment C. difficile infection . We believe important determine actual rate failure treatment metronidazole . This provide impetus develop new therapeutic approach . We review record patient treat confirmed C. difficile infection metronidazole VAMC past 12 month order determine rate cure , failure , relapse follow therapy . This simple record review study determine clinical suspicion correct , namely , rate failure metronidazole therapy much high report medical literature 10-15 year ago .</detailed_description>
