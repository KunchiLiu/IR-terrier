	<brief_summary>The purpose gene therapy study evaluate safety efficacy intramuscular gene transfer use Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) placebo patient moderate high-risk Critical Limb Ischemia ( condition poor blood circulation leg ) . This trial ass whether VEGF improve rest pain and/or heals ulcer legs patient peripheral artery disease ( blockages leg artery . ) VEGF DNA , genetic material inject leg muscle three separate occasion , 2 week apart . Once DNA leg , direct cell artery wall increase production VEGF , show cause new blood vessel grow . This experimental therapy design grow new blood vessel around blockage leg artery . The total length participation study approximately 1 year require approximately 8 clinic visit within year . Following enrollment study , test may do cancer screening , blood work , physical exam , vascular test eye exam . There charge test office visit require study . This study approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) .</brief_summary>
