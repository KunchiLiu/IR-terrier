	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate safety appropriate dose combination Temodar Sutent first-line therapy patient metastatic malignant melanoma ( Phase 1 ) . Once safety appropriate dose determine , additional patient study dose determine clinical benefit determine primary end-point progression-free survival ( PFS ) 6 month additional secondary endpoint ( Phase II ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients unresectable metastatic melanoma dismal prognosis . The disease respond poorly currently available chemotherapy biological agent . The median survival patient population 6 - 10 month improve significantly decade . The FDA approve DTIC 1975 high dose intravenous bolus rIL-2 1998 agent approve therapy patient metastatic melanoma . In Phase III trial report 2000 , temozolomide ( Temodar , Schering-Plough ) demonstrate equivalent overall survival DTIC patient metastatic melanoma , advantage provide improve progression-free survival , ease administration ( oral ) , cross blood-brain barrier . Temozolomide DTIC precursor active metabolite , monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide ( MTIC ) . SU11248 ( Sutent , Pfizer ) multi-targeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor target 3 distinct vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR-1 , -2 , -3 ) , platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha beta ( PDGFR-α -β ) , KIT receptor tyrosine kinase , fms-related tyrosine kinase 3/Flk2 ( FLT3 ) . Although angiogenic factor identify , VEGF potent specific regulator angiogenesis SU11248 target one , 3 VEGF signal pathway . Dacarbazine ( DTIC ) cause transcriptional up-regulation VEGF melanoma cell postulate possible mechanism escape chemotherapy efficacy . Temozolomide , act metabolite , MTIC , would expect activity . PDGFR-α -β important new target tumor cell proliferation angiogenesis . PDGF signal pathway implicate development growth solid tumor . Inhibition PDGF receptor show inhibit angiogenesis , tumor vascular maturation maintenance , tumor cell proliferation - induce tumor regression . In murine model , combination chemotherapy VEGF PDFG receptor inhibitor result remarkable survival advantage . The study open-label , single arm trial . The patient sample approximately 56-62 individual , male females 18 year age old measurable metastatic melanoma . Study participant must meet number laboratory criterion order admit study . The study duration expect approximately 2 year . Patients offer treatment 1 year expect complete median 6 cycle treatment . An interim analysis safety conduct completion treatment 6 patient cohort determination make whether continue next cohort accord specification protocol . If acceptable dose regimen find , study proceed Phase II portion . Progression-free survival determine 6 month time point patient complete study . The study ≥90 % power detect increase 6-month progression-free survival rate ≤15 % , result expect patient receive available first-line therapy , ≥35 % patient receive combination temozolomide SU11248 , base one group chi-square test 0.05 two-sided significance level .</detailed_description>
