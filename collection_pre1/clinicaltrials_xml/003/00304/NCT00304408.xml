	<brief_summary>The purpose study three fold : 1 ) To collect serum patient document Clostridium difficile infection test presence antibody C. difficile toxin start end therapy , relapse recurrence occur . 2 ) To collect stool sample test C. difficile toxin similar time interval . 3 ) To assay random serum sample VA lab order determine rate antibody C. difficile toxin patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Association Between Response Treatment C. Diff Colitis Anti-C.Diff Toxin Antibody</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile lead cause nosocomial diarrheal disease associate antibiotic therapy . This debilitate condition substantial morbidity mortality may around 2-3 % . Current recommend therapy condition metronidazole , give orally . Our observation suggest 10-20 % patient fail respond initial therapy metronidazole , 20 % relapse treatment . The reason person cure whereas others relapse , present , unknown . There suggestion medical literature recurrent infection associate failure generate antibody C. difficile toxin . It also possible patient become infected lack antibody , whereas others population tend antibody . The investigator propose study patient VAMC Houston order relate occurrence and/or failure respond therapy appearance recurrent disease presence anti-toxin antibody . The investigator also propose study serum obtain random VAMC patient order determine prevalence antibody patient population .</detailed_description>
