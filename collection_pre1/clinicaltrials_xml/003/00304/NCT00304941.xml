	<brief_summary>This study characterize risk factor associate breast cancer development patient . In particular , examine role insulin breast cancer patient without family history disease . Women 30 70 year old diagnose breast cancer match control healthy subject without family history breast cancer may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Cancer-genetic counseling session , include family history , risk assessment , genetic test BRCA1 BRCA2 ( criterion meet ) , interpretation result management option - Medical history , include question symptom disease , reproductive history , use oral contraceptive , body weight , exercise , lifestyle , demographic issue - Drawing family tree - Examination medical record - Blood draw genetic test - CT scan abdomen ( approximate time &lt; 1 minute ) - Filling questionnaire</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The etiology breast cancer still poorly understood know risk factor explain small proportion case . Risk factor modulate development breast cancer include : age , geographic location , socioeconomic status , reproductive event , exogenous hormone , lifestyle , familial history breast cancer , mammographic density , history benign breast disease , ionize radiation , bone density . Several line evidence demonstrate insulin insulin receptor play key role formation progression breast cancer . Insulin direct indirect effect breast cancer ; direct effect growth promote factor indirect effect action hormone involve breast cancer . In addition , certain condition associate insulin resistance , obesity abdominal fat , know risk factor breast cancer . Family history breast cancer also well establish major risk factor . To date , genetic non-genetic factor suggest influence breast cancer risk woman positive family history breast cancer include recognize mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 gene . Women family history breast cancer inherit susceptibility condition ; development disease require series promote step include lifestyle , diet , environmental factor . Several hormone involve breast cancer IGF-1 , testosterone , SHBG affect positive family history breast cancer . Also , woman high Waist-to-Hip ratio ( WHR ) positive family history breast cancer high risk develop breast cancer woman high WHR without positive family history . The role insulin insulin-related factor woman family history breast cancer examine . There grow recognition insulin may potential mediator breast cancer . The evidence suggest action insulin may involve promote step predispose woman breast cancer . These finding provide biological basis insulin related factor serve potential target breast cancer prevention risk assessment . The main goal proposal unravel contribution insulin insulin-related action ( e.g . insulin resistance , abdominal fat ) breast cancer risk . The purpose present study characterize role insulin newly diagnose premenopausal postmenopausal woman without family history breast cancer . The objective ass relative strength risk factor associate insulin action individual impact breast cancer . This study provide data may serve basis future study preventive strategy target lower insulin level increase insulin sensitivity ( e.g . decrease glucose , decrease abdominal fat , decrease omega-6 fatty acids/increase omega-3 fatty acid , increase fiber intake , increase exercise ) subset patient . This protocol recruit female patient , concentrate breast cancer risk . Subjects ask complete several questionnaire course genetic counseling provide information medical reproductive history , demographic , risk factor , physical activity well information need establish appropriate sample study . Genetic test offer part initial evaluation check BRCA1/2 mutation status .</detailed_description>
