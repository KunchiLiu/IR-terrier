	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make peptide may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving booster vaccination may make strong immune response kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect vaccine therapy treating patient stage III stage IV breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety vaccine comprise multiple synthetic breast cancer-associated peptide tetanus toxoid helper peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 patient stage III IV adenocarcinoma breast . - Determine , preliminarily , frequency immune response 9 class I MHC-restricted peptide patient treat vaccine . - Determine , preliminarily , cytotoxic response T-cells allogeneic breast cancer cell autologous breast cancer cell ( available ) . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive peptide vaccine comprise 9 synthetic breast cancer peptides tetanus toxoid helper peptide emulsify Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously intradermally daily day 1 , 8 , 15 , 36 , 57 , 78 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 12 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
