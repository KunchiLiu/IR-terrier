	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate RAF265 , Oral Drug Administered Subjects With Locally Advanced Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway play prominent role control several key cellular function include growth , proliferation survival . B-Raf member Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway frequently mutate melanoma result activation MAPK pathway . RAF265 novel , orally active , small molecule potent inhibitory activity B-Raf kinase additional antiangiogenic activity inhibition vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) non-clinical study . The primary objective study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) , safety profile RAF265 administer orally subject locally advanced metastatic melanoma ; determine plasma pharmacokinetics ( PKs ) orally administer RAF265 ; evaluate potential pharmacodynamic effect RAF265 use tumor biopsy , peripheral blood sample , tumor imaging .</detailed_description>
