	<brief_title>A 12-Week Safety Pharmacodynamic Study AT1001 Female Patients With Fabry Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study phase 2 , open-label trial previously untreated patient Fabry disease . The trial consist 4 week screen phase , 12-week treatment phase may extend additional 36 week , 2-week follow-up phase . Twelve female patient plan enrol two site . The number visit first part study 7 extension treatment part , 3 . Once patient complete treatment , require attend follow visit . After determination missense genotype , patient initially screen Day -28 collection blood evaluation enhanceablity α-Gal A leukocyte . Patients come treatment facility Screening assessment Day -2 Day -1 , baseline assessment include α-Gal A GL-3 plasma ( leukocyte ) , skin tissue , cardiac tissue , renal tissue , GL-3 urine , baseline evaluation safety , cardiac , renal , CNS parameter describe schedule assessment . From Day 1 , patient initiate AT1001 every day oral dose 12 week . Patients stratify α-Gal A enzyme activity ( high &gt; 40 % , low ≤ 40 % ) randomly assign receive one three specify dose level . Patients return treatment facility Visits 1 4 . Safety measure perform visit . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) measure perform predose 10 hour postdose Days 1 , 14 84 . Pharmacodynamic measurement form blood leukocyte measurement α-Gal A plasma urine measurement α-Gal A GL-3 performed visit . A final set skin , cardiac , renal biopsy perform Visit 4 . Evaluations cardiac renal function parameter describe schedule assessment perform various timepoints : ECG serum creatinine Visits 1 4 ; glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ; 24-hr Quantitative Holter monitor ECG , ECHO , cardiac MRI , natriuretic factor , treadmill cardiac stress test , renal ultrasound ( perform Porto Alegre site ) , Brain MRI , QSART ( perform Porto Alegre site ) transcranial Doppler Screening Visit 4 . Cognitive Testing perform Screening , Baseline , Visit 4 . Patients also come treatment facility end treatment period . If continuing 36-week treatment extension , patient return clinic follow-up visit 2 week end treatment . Patients continue treatment extension return clinic additional visit Weeks 24 ( Visit 6 ) , 36 ( Visit 7 ) 48 ( Visit 8 ) safety assessment specific pharmacodynamic functional measurement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must adult female 18 65 year age ( inclusive ) heterozygous Fabry disease . Patients must confirm diagnosis Fabry disease document missense gene mutation ( individual familial ) enhanceable enzyme activity ( vitro test : presence residual Gal A activity [ great equal 3 % normal ] lymphocytes great equal 20 % increase activity lymphocytes incubated AT1001 ) . Patients must naïve ERT therapy , except palliative therapy sign symptom Fabry disease , must stop ERT least 18 week . Patients must end organ dysfunction , even minimal , demonstrate either evidence leave ventricular hypertrophy document abnormal ECG echocardiogram cardiac biopsy , renal insufficiency document common clinical assessment creatinine glomerular filtration rate renal biopsy brain tissue document evidence stroke ( clinically image ) , peripheral nervous tissue document complaint intolerance heat cold , decrease vibratory sense proprioception , decrease ability perspire , acroparesthesia . Patient agree sexually abstinent practice effective method contraception engage sexual activity course study period 30 day follow completion study woman childbearing potential . Patients must previously untreated ERT substrate depletion Fabry disease , willing temporarily stop treatment study , willing undergo two renal , two cardiac , two skin biopsy . Patients must willing able provide write informed consent . The patient exclude study : She pregnant lactating ; She history organ transplant ; There evidence significant disease Fabry disease ( e.g. , endstage renal disease ; Heart disease [ per clinical history , documented event , test class III/IV accord New York Heart Association classification ] ; Current diagnosis cancer , except basal cell carcinoma skin ; Diabetes ( unless HbA1c le equal 8 ) ; Neurological disease impairs ability participate study ) ; Serum creatinine great 176 umol/L day 2 ; QTc interval &gt; 450 msec ; Pacemaker contraindication MRI scanning ; Taking medication prohibit protocol experimental therapy indication . Patients participate clinical trial last 30 day . Patients condition , opinion investigator would jeopardize safety patient impact validity study result .</criteria>
