	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure efficacy vary spinal cord stimulation frequencies pulse-width setting chronic pain management . The spinal cord stimulator setting effective chronic pain management hope reveal purpose study . In double-blind study , patient staff aware spinal cord stimulator setting patient week . The representative set setting week blind identity patient set spinal cord stimulator another room . While paper show efficacy spinal cord stimulation treat chronic pain , yet study perform measure role stimulation frequency pulse-widths . This study hop first .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Spinal Cord Stimulation Efficacy Measures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For total 9 week , patient randomize 9 stimulation frequency pulse-width setting combination . The patient stay setting week time . Prior patient 's first office visit , he/she ask take chest x-ray . The patient also repeat chest x-ray end study . Each patient ask provide daily information regard pain medication usage , spinal cord stimulation usage , amplitude setting , pain rating . Additionally , patient fill Multidimensional Pain Inventory ( MPI ) McGill Pain Questionnaire ( MPQ ) every Monday come office , he/she randomize new setting week . The patient also receive call research assistant see he/she week patient provide pertinent contact information call time ask question . The patient withdraw study completely point drop setting week . The patient follow-up visit month study 's end date discus patient manage his/her pain his/her spinal cord stimulator setting . Each patient compensate complete study . Efficacy measure base patient 's answer pain probe , device usage , medication usage .</detailed_description>
