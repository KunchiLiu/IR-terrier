	<brief_summary>An open-label , dose-adjustment , extension study evaluate safety efficacy eltrombopag treatment subject idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) previously enrol eltrombopag trial . This study allow adjustment eltrombopag dose achieve individualize dose schedule subject . In addition , ability reduce dose concomitant ITP medication presence eltrombopag , maintain platelet count = 50,000/microL investigate .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible participation study previously randomize ITP study eltrombopag ( e.g. , TRA100773 TRA102537/RAISE TRA108057/REPEAT ) meet inclusion exclusion criterion . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Subject sign dated write informed consent . Adults ( ≥18 year ) diagnose ITP accord American Society Hematology/British Committee Standards Haematology ( ASH/BCSH ) guideline [ George , 1996 ; BCSH , 2003 ] . In addition , peripheral blood smear support diagnosis ITP evidence disease causative thrombocytopenia ( e.g. , pseudo thrombocytopenia , myelofibrosis ) . The physical examination suggest disease may cause thrombocytopenia ITP . Prior completion treatment follow period ITP study eltrombopag ( e.g. , TRA100773 TRA102537/RAISE TRA108057/REPEAT ) . Subjects previously enrol Study TRA100773 must complete prescribed followup ophthalmic assessment 6 month . Subjects previously enrol TRA102537/RAISE study may lead EXTEND ( e.g. , TRA108057/REPEAT ) must complete treatment followup period define protocol . Subject experience eltrombopagrelated toxicity drug intolerance prior eltrombopag study ( e.g. , TRA100773 TRA102537/RAISE TRA108057/REPEAT ) even resolve ; subject discontinue previous study due toxicity eligible unless receive placebo . Subject intercurrent medical event , include thrombosis . Subjects must either initially respond ( platelet count &gt; 100,000/mL ) previous ITP therapy bone marrow examination consistent ITP within 3 year rule myelodysplastic syndrome cause thrombocytopenia Previous therapy ITP immunoglobulin ( IVIg antiD ) must complete least 1 week prior first dose study medication platelet count must show clear downward trend last treatment immunoglobulin . Previous treatment ITP splenectomy , rituximab cyclophosphamide must complete least 4 week prior randomization , clearly ineffective . Subjects treat concomitant ITP medication ( e.g . corticosteroid azathioprine ) must receive dose stable least 4 week prior randomization . Subjects treat cyclosporine A , mycophenolate mofetil danazol must receive dose stable least 3 month prior first dose study medication . Prothrombin time ( PT/INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) must within 80 120 % normal range history hypercoagulable state . A complete blood count ( CBC ) , within reference range ( include WBC differential indicative disorder ITP ) , follow exception : Hemoglobin : Subjects hemoglobin level 10.0 g/dL low limit normal eligible inclusion , anemia clearly attributable ITP ( excessive blood loss ) . ANC≥1500/mL ( 1.5 x 10^9/L ) require inclusion ( elevated WBC/ANC due steroid treatment acceptable ) . The following clinical chemistry MUST NOT exceed upper limit normal ( ULN ) reference range 20 % : creatinine , ALT , AST , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase . In addition , total albumin must lower limit normal ( LLN ) 10 % . Subject practice acceptable method contraception ( documented chart ) . Female subject ( female partner male subject ) must either nonchildbearing potential ( hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral tubal ligation postmenopausal &gt; 1 year ) , childbearing potential use one follow highly effective method contraception ( i.e. , Pearl Index &lt; 1.0 % ) two week prior administration study medication , throughout study , 28 day completion premature discontinuation study : Complete abstinence intercourse ; Intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; Two form barrier contraception ( diaphragm plus spermicide , male condom plus spermicide ) ; Male partner sterile prior entry study partner female ; Systemic contraceptive ( combine progesterone ) . Subject able understand comply protocol requirement instruction . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Any clinically relevant abnormality , ITP , identify screen examination , medical condition circumstance , opinion investigator make subject unsuitable participation study suggest another another primary diagnosis ( e.g. , thrombocytopenia secondary another disease ) . Concurrent malignant disease and/or history cancer treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . Any prior history arterial venous thrombosis ( stroke , transient ischemic attack , myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism ) , AND≥two follow risk factor : hormone replacement therapy , systemic contraception ( contain estrogen ) , smoke , diabetes , hypercholesterolemia , medication hypertension , cancer , hereditary thrombophilic disorder ( e.g. , Factor V Leiden , ATIII deficiency , etc ) , family history arterial venous thrombosis Preexisting cardiovascular disease ( include congestive heart failure , New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Grade III/IV ) , arrhythmia know increase risk thromboembolic event ( e.g . atrial fibrillation ) , subject QTc &gt; 450 msec . Female subject nurse pregnant ( positive serum urine bhuman chorionic gonadotrophin ( bhCG ) pregnancy test ) screen predose Day 1 . History alcohol/drug abuse . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day five halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose study medication . Subject treat drug affect platelet function ( include limit aspirin , clopidogrel and/or NSAIDs ) anticoagulants &gt; 3 consecutive day within 2 week study start end study . History platelet agglutination abnormality prevents reliable measurement platelet count . All subject secondary immune thrombocytopenia , include laboratory clinical evidence HIV infection , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , chronic hepatitis B infection , hepatitis C virus infection , evidence active hepatitis time subject screening . If potential subject clinical history would support HIV infection hepatitis infection , laboratory screen necessary ; however , standard medical practice would suggest evaluation patient risk factor infection . A subject planning cataract surgery . In France , subject neither affiliated beneficiary social security category . Other Eligibility Criteria Considerations : To assess potential impact subject eligibility regard safety , investigator must refer follow document ( ) detail information regard warning , precaution , contraindication , adverse event , significant data pertain investigational product ( ) use study : CIB , SPM .</criteria>
