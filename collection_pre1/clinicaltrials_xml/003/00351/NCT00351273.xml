	<brief_title>Combination Antibiotic Treatment Reactive Arthritis Caused Chlamydia Bacteria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The initial infection cause reactive arthritis cause one two bacteria : Chlamydia trachomatis , usually acquire sexual contact , Chlamydia pneumoniae , cause respiratory infection . Most people recover fully initial flare arthritis symptom . However , 20 % people reactive arthritis experience long-lasting symptom . In individual , Chlamydia bacteria exist persistent metabolically active state within joint tissue , even year initial exposure . The bacteria produce heat shock protein ( HSPs ) , think play key role chronic persistent state Chlamydia may stimulate immune inflammatory response see reactive arthritis . This indicate need antimicrobial therapy reduce Chlamydia 's HSP production block metabolism . The purpose study determine effectiveness long-term combination antibiotic therapy treat people chronic reactive arthritis . The study use two different combination common antibiotic : doxycycline pair rifampin azithromycin pair rifampin . This study entail 6 month treatment follow 3 month follow-up . After screen , eligible participant randomly assign one three treatment group : rifampin day plus doxycycline twice day ; rifampin day plus azithromycin day 5 day , twice weekly ; placebo . Study visit occur baseline Months 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 . At visit , participant undergo interview , physical examination , blood collection . They also complete questionnaire relate symptom functional status . At screen Month 6 , synovial biopsy may perform . This involve take sample tissue line joint .</detailed_description>
