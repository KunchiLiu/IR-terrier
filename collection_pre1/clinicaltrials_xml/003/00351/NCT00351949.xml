	<detailed_description>This single-center , single-arm , open label , non-randomized , fixed dose-escalation , phase 1 study , perform ambulatory day-hospital setting . After screen period , patient enter drug administration period , follow 'post-study ' period . Four IMP321 dose level , 50 µg , 250 µg , 1.250 mg , 6.250 mg 30 mg evaluate successive cohort patient . At give dose level 3 patient administer one subcutaneous dose every 2 week total 12 week ( 6 injection total ) , separate 13-day administration-free interval . The next ( high ) dose level dose 3 new patient previous dose level well tolerate . Investigator decide whether safety acceptable perform evaluation third administration ( week 8 ) next patient include . The successive cohort patient summarized follow : - Cohort A correspond group 3 patient receive 50 µg dose . If safety dose level acceptable evaluated fortnight 6-week administration , follow cohort undertaken . - Cohort B correspond group 3 patient receive 250 µg dose . If safety dose level acceptable evaluated fortnight 6-week administration , follow cohort undertaken . - Cohort C correspond group 3 patient receive 1,250 µg dose . If safety dose level acceptable evaluated fortnight 6-week administration , follow cohort undertaken . - Cohort D correspond group 3 patient receive 1,250 µg dose . If safety dose level acceptable evaluated fortnight 6-week administration , follow cohort undertaken . - Cohort E correspond group 3 patient receive 6,250 µg dose . The patient receive first administration one-by-one two-weeks interval . If safety dose level acceptable evaluated fortnight 6-week administration last patient , follow cohort undertaken . - Cohort F correspond group 3 patient receive 6,250 µg dose . If tolerability dose level judge acceptable cohort E , three patient receive first IMP321 injection simultaneously . - Cohort G correspond group 3 patient receive 30,000 µg dose . The patient receive first IMP321 administration one-by-one two-weeks interval ( +/- 5 day ) . If safety dose level acceptable evaluated fortnight 6-week administration last patient , follow cohort undertaken . - Cohort H correspond group 3 patient receive 30,000 µg dose . If tolerability dose level judge acceptable cohort E , three patient receive first IMP321 injection simultaneously . Once main period study complete , namely two week cohort complete , i.e . week 14 , patient undergo ambulatory 'post-study ' examination . Patients Cohort B , C , E , F G participate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study patient pharmacodynamic ( PD ) study involve additional blood sample .</detailed_description>
