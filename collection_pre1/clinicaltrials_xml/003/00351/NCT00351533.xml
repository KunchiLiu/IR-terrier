	<brief_title>A Phase II Randomized Trial Fish Oil Patients With Acute Lung Injury ( ALI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) common among critically ill patient associate high case fatality . Only one intervention show improve survival large clinical trial , new therapy target inflammatory response need . Nutrient intervention may provide benefit ; specifically plausible biologic rationale administer n-3 fatty acid ( n-3 FAs ) find fish oil patient ALI , n-3 FAs decrease formation eicosanoid inflammatory mediator . However , although promising result emerge prior study , fish oil test ALI patient commercial enteral formula contain additional nutrient , control group receive high-fat enteral formula may proinflammatory . Therefore , conclusion drawn independent effect fish oil . Furthermore , inclusion key pharmaconutrients feed formula , instead deliver separately pharmaceutical , limit exposure agent , intensive care unit ( ICU ) patient commonly receive less 60 % prescribed caloric need . Finally , specialize feeding formula expensive , may substantially cheaper administer pharmaconutrients separately . We believe time begin approach nutrient trial critically ill patient differently -- move away include feed formulas begin deliver like pharmaceutical . With appropriate scientific investigation use non-nutrient placebo , novel innovative approach new paradigm investigate nutrient delivery critically ill patient . This study phase II randomize control trial determine effect enteral eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexanoic acid ( DHA ) , n-3 FAs find fish oil , versus placebo pulmonary systemic environment , clinical outcome , patient ALI . We investigate effect fish oil administration several biological marker injury inflammation bronchoalveolar lavage fluid serum , pulmonary physiologic outcome , clinical outcome . Comparison ( ) : Mechanically ventilate patient acute lung injury randomize receive enteral fish oil versus compare mechanically ventilated patient acute lung injury randomize receive placebo .</detailed_description>
