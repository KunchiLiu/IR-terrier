	<brief_title>A Placebo-Controlled , Cross-Over Trial Aripiprazole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : This study ten-week , placebo-controlled , double-blind , cross-over , randomized trial novel antipsychotic agent , aripiprazole , add 20 obese stable olanzapine-treated patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . The advantage crossover design subject act control few subject require . Study Procedures : We design trial examine effect upon weight , lipid , glucose metabolism , positive symptom , negative symptom , depressive symptom . This project , examine usefulness combination therapy , may offer possible intervention patient obese treated olanzapine , otherwise experience good clinical response . Many patient , despite medical problem may occur , reluctant switch antipsychotic agent . Location : This study perform Freedom Trail Clinic Erich Lindemann Mental Health Center faculty Schizophrenia Program Massachusetts General Hospital staff Freedom Trail Clinic . Subjects : Subjects include 20 stable outpatient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder treat olanzapine least one year . Prior enrollment , determine clinician optimize dose antipsychotic maintain medication stable dose least 1 month . Patients exclude significant medical illness , substance abuse , inability provide inform consent . Safety Assessments : Medication Trial : Patients baseline assessment perform randomized placebo aripiprazole 15 mg/day 4 week . After initial 4 week medication patient reassess , 2-week washout period crossover treatment another 4 week . The olanzapine dose unchanged trial . Patients give two-week supply medication baseline week 2 week 6 8 . Screening Visit The diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder confirm research psychiatrist use DSM IV criterion . A physical examination perform medical history , vital sign , weight , height , waist/hip circumference , skin-fold measurement , 12-lead EKG demographic information obtain . Laboratory measure include olanzapine blood level , fast glucose , insulin , basic chemistry profile , liver enzymes , CBC , lipid profile , leptin , LDL- particle size , PAI-1 , C-reactive protein , sICAM , vWF DNA sample drawn screen future analysis 5-HT-2C H1 receptor gene . Baseline Assessment : The following scale complete baseline comprise treatment efficacy battery : Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) , Clinical Global Impressions scale ( CGI ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) , Global Assessment Scale ( GAS ) , Fatigue Scale Inventory ( FSI ) Trauma History Questionnaire ( THQ ) Quality Life Scale ( QOL ) . A single rater perform assessment . If necessary use second rater , inter-rater reliability establish addition second rater repeat every three month use videotaped interview . The treatment efficacy battery repeat week 4 , 6 10 except THQ , administer begin study . Safety Monitoring Assessments : Blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , weight , waist/hip circumference perform visit ( baseline , week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 10 ) . Side effect monitor baseline week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 use Systematic Assessment Treatment Emergent Events ( SAFTEE ) . Body fat composition measure skin-fold caliper baseline , week 4 , 6 10 . EPS evaluate baseline week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 10 use Simpson-Angus Scale , Barnes Akathisia Scale , Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) . Measure Energy Expenditure Dietary Assessment : Patients ask wear accelerometer four consecutive day obtain objective measure physical activity . During four day patient maintain four-day food record food beverage consume . This provide mean assess energy intake verse energy output . Patients also complete Modifiable Activity Questionnaire ( MAQ ) . Energy expenditure dietary intake assess baseline , week 4 , 6 10 . Randomization : The double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study consist two random order 4-week treatment arm ( aripiprazole 15 mg placebo ) separate 2-week adjuvant treatment washout . Following baseline , subject randomize , double-blind , either aripiprazole placebo 4 week . After initial 4 week medication patient reassess , 2-week washout period crossover treatment another 4 week . Subject Recruitment : Potential subject identify clinician Freedom Trail Clinic . Patients give physician verbal permission contact research purpose . A member research team meet subject explain study protocol , include review risk potential benefit . A copy study consent form provide patient time . Patients express interest first meet evaluate competency provide inform consent physician member research team . Patients judge competent ask meet principal investigator review study protocol consent form patient obtain informed consent . The human right officer North Suffolk Mental Health Association ask participate meeting unless patient decline . Family residential staff also invite participate patient agree . Potential Risks : Aripiprazole produce serious adverse effect animal human safety study . No consistent abnormality vital sign , laboratory , EKG EEG emerge . In clinical trial , side effect occur rate great 2x placebo . Nausea , vomiting , anxiety , headache , dyspepsia , somnolence , orthostatic hypotension , tachycardia , insomnia , akathisia , EPS , weight gain may potential side effect . Benefits : It know aripiprazole add olanzapine help subject 's mood , motivation , hallucination , unusual experience . Other patient may benefit study find aripiprazole add olanzapine useful treating symptom schizophrenia . Data Management Statistical Analysis : Data management statistical analysis provide Dr. David Schoenfeld Massachusetts General Hospital , Biostatistics Center . Protection Human Subjects : Principal member research team complete certification protection human subject clinical trial . The clinical protocol submit approval institutional review board Massachusetts Department Mental Health . Potential subject refer clinician . Clinicians ask sign statement verifies patient interested participating , understand participation voluntary , understands decline participation affect treatment facility . A member research team meet patient explain study protocol , include review risk potential benefit . A copy study consent form provide patient time share family member residential staff . Patients continue express interest first meet evaluated physician member research team capacity provide inform consent . Patients judge competent ask meet principal investigator co-investigator review study protocol consent form patient obtain informed consent .</detailed_description>
