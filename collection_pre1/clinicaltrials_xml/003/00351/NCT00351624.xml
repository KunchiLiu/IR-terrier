	<detailed_description>DHA primary omega-3 fatty acid present brain retina play crucial structural functional role issue . The primary dietary source DHA fatty fish ( e.g. , salmon , herring , tuna ) . The American diet provide one lowest level omega-3 fatty acid industrialize nation . Children age 1 5 year consume 30 50 mg DHA per day despite high requirement nutrient support growth tissue turnover . Studies human infant report visual cognitive benefit DHA supplementation early life . Reported benefit include significant improvement test visual acuity infancy , psychomotor mental development first two year life , problem-solving sustain attention around 5 year age . Few study evaluate effect DHA supplementation cognitive function old child . Studies consider DHA supplementation child 4-12 year age attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) developmental disorder show improvement several measure attention , behavior , executive function . Given estimate high requirement DHA support growth maintenance brain , low consumption DHA American child , evidence human animal study DHA status affect functional capacity central nervous system , reasonable expectation DHA supplementation administer preschool-aged child improve performance test attention , memory , process speed , error rate .</detailed_description>
