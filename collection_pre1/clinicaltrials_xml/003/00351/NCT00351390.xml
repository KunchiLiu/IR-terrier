	<brief_summary>Levels amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) hormone release heart patient heart failure ( HF ) strongly prognostic adverse event , hospitalization death HF . Therapies beneficial HF ( beta blocker angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ) tend low level NT-proBNP parallel improvement outcomes patient treat . Importantly , Nt-proBNP level may identify patient high risk adverse outcome HF , even period apparent stability . It remain unclear , however , whether treat patient base NT-proBNP concentration would associate good outcome compare standard HF therapy without measurement NT-proBNP value . The goal PROTECT study evaluate whether treatment patient advance recently destabilize HF would benefit NT-proBNP guided HF treatment , compare standard HF therapy without 'hormone guide ' treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>300 patient class II-IV heart failure ( HF ) due systolic dysfunction ( left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % ) recent ( within 6 month ) destabilize HF randomize 1:1 either 'standard care ' therapy HF versus 'standard care plus NT-proBNP guide ' care . At randomization , patient MGH undergo 2-dimensional echocardiogram cardiac structure function . Patients randomize 'standard care ' arm study receive aggressive therapy HF , include evidence-based addition/titration therapeutic agent trial , carvedilol metoprolol XL , angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker , spironolactone inhibitor ( class III IV ) , digoxin ( applicable ) , loop diuretic , well nitrate without hydralazine . Biventricular pace with/without ICD capability perform discretion investigator . Any change therapy accompany 2 week follow re-assessment titration medication , base clinical judgment . At interim visit , patient 'standard care ' arm Minnesota Living Heart Failure questionnaire take . For visit , include trigger med change , laboratory check include serum chemistry ; sample blood blind NT-proBNP , troponin T , high sensitivity CRP obtain measurement trial complete . Patients randomize 'standard care plus NT-proBNP guide ' arm receive aggressive medical care , also unblinded measurement NT-proBNP provide study investigator within hour first patient contact . Therapeutic decision-making first base clinical acumen/judgment , NT-proBNP elevate , per protocol , investigator adjust therapy accordingly , include escalation exist therapy know effect NT-proBNP level , well possible addition similar therapy yet use ( spironolactone ) . Patients follow event include destabilize HF ( outpatient ) , cardiovascular event ( include ischemic complication , ICD discharge , development non-fatal arrhythmia atrial fibrillation ) , death . At end one year , event rate assess outcomes two arm compare . As well , echocardiography perform subject one year difference baseline group assess .</detailed_description>
