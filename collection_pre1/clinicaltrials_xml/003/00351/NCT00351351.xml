	<brief_summary>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PNL ) , conjunction intracorporeal lithotripsy , allow rapid removal kidney stone regardless size . Currently , choice intracorporeal lithotripters include ultrasonic , pneumatic , combine ultrasonic/pneumatic energy source . Recently , novel dual probe design introduce Cybersonics Erie , Pennsylvania . This dual probe intracorporeal lithotrite call Cyberwand , compose fix inner probe vibrate ultrasonic frequency outer probe vibrate 1,000 Hz . As new design potential revolutionize intracorporeal lithotripsy , intend compare novel technology currently available lithotripsy technology randomize clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Dual Probe Ultrasonic Lithotripsy Single Probe Ultrasonic Lithotripsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Percutaneous nephrolithotomy ( PNL ) use remove large complex stone upper urinary tract . Intracorporeal lithotripsy integral part PNL . Commercially available intracorporeal lithotripsy modality include ultrasonic , pneumatic , combine ultrasonic pneumatic model . Each modality inherent advantage disadvantage . Ultrasonic lithotrites capable fragmenting stone concomitantly suction fragment . Unfortunately stone hard enough resist fragmentation ultrasonic lithotripsy . Pneumatic lithotrites able fragment stone regardless hardness , modality unable suction stone piece time fragmentation occur . The new lithotrite combine ultrasonic pneumatic component capable fragment stone , also inherent limitation . The handpiece lithotripsy device somewhat cumbersome , suction component clog , device overheat maximal setting ( Kuo et al ) . Current intracorporeal lithotrites , functional , certainly improve . Recently , novel dual probe design introduce Cybersonics Erie , PA . This dual probe intracorporeal lithotrite call Cyberwand compose fix inner probe vibrate ultrasonic frequency outer probe vibrate 1,000 Hz . As new design potential revolutionalize intracorporeal lithotripsy , intend compare novel technology currently available lithotripsy technology randomize clinical trial .</detailed_description>
