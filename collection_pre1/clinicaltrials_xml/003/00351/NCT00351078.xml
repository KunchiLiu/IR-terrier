	<brief_summary>In patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , disease cause nonsense mutation ( premature stop codon ) gene make cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator ( CFTR ) protein . PTC124 show partially restore CFTR production animal CF due nonsense mutation . In ongoing Phase 2a study perform Hadassah University Hospital - Mount Scopus Israel , patient nonsense-mutation-mediated CF receive PTC124 two 14-day treatment course . Preliminary result study indicate PTC124 pharmacodynamic activity PTC124 CF PTC124 safely administer patient population . This Phase 2b extension study design evaluate activity safety 3 month ( approximately 84 day ) continuous treatment PTC124 patient enrol Phase 2a study . The main purpose study understand whether PTC124 safely administer achieve pharmacodynamic activity patient CF due nonsense mutation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , patient enrol previous study PTC124 ( protocol number PTC124-GD-005-CF ) treat investigational drug PTC124 period 84 day . Evaluation procedure ( history , physical examination , blood urine test assess organ function , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , chest x-ray , CF-specific test ) determine patient qualifies study perform within 21 day prior start treatment . Eligible patient elect enroll study assign receive PTC124 treatment ( base upon TEPD result previous study ) 1 2 follow dose level : - PTC124 , give 3 time per day ( TID ) regimen 4 mg/kg breakfast , 4 mg/kg lunch , 8 mg/kg dinner , - PTC124 , give 3 time per day ( TID ) regimen 10 mg/kg breakfast , 10 mg/kg lunch 20 mg/kg dinner . During study , PTC124 efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetics evaluate periodically measurement transepithelial potential difference ( TEPD ) , medical history , physical examination , blood test , urinalysis , sputum test , ECGs , chest x-ray , pulmonary function test .</detailed_description>

Oxygen saturation ( measure pulse oximetry ) ≥92 % room air . Willingness male female patient , surgically sterile , abstain sexual intercourse employ barrier medical method contraception study drug administration followup period . Negative pregnancy test ( female childbearing potential ) . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , drug administration plan , study procedure , study restriction . Ability provide write informed consent . Evidence sign date informed consent document indicate patient inform pertinent aspect trial . The presence follow condition exclude patient enrollment study : Prior ongoing medical condition , medical history , physical finding , ECG finding , laboratory abnormality , investigator 's opinion , could adversely affect safety patient , make unlikely course treatment followup would complete , could impair assessment study result . Ongoing acute illness include acute upper low respiratory infection within 2 week start study treatment study . History major complication lung disease ( include recent massive hemoptysis pneumothorax ) within 2 month prior start study treatment study . Abnormalities screen chest xray suggest clinically significant active pulmonary disease CF , new , significant abnormality atelectasis pleural effusion may indicative clinically significant active pulmonary involvement secondary CF .
