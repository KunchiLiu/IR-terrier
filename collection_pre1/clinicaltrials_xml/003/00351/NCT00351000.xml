	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : This study six-week , open label trial novel antipsychotic agent , ziprasidone , add stable dose clozapine olanzapine 40 diabetes mellitus patient , patient impair fast glucose insulin resistance schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . STUDY PROCEDURES : We design trial examine effect upon weight , lipid glucose metabolism along positive symptom , negative symptom , depressive symptom six-week open label study . Location : This study perform Freedom Trail Clinic faculty Schizophrenia Program Massachusetts General Hospital staff Freedom Trail Clinic . Subjects : Subjects include 40 outpatient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder treat clozapine olanzapine least one year . Twenty clozapine-treated subject twenty olanzapine-treated subject type 2 diabetes mellitus , impair fast glucose , insulin resistance recruit . Patients exclude significant medical illness , seizure disorder , substance abuse , inability provide inform consent . Methods : Medication Trial : Patients treat open label ziprasidone 40 mg 2x/day first 2 week . After 2 week study drug may increase ziprasidone 80 mg 2x/day . The clozapine olanzapine dose unchanged trial . Patients give two-week supply medication baseline week 2 4 additional capsule study drug compliance accountability . Following completion trial patient option continue ziprasidone . Subjects return 4 week follow study completion examine whether observed change persistent . Additionally , patient assess 3 month follow-up post 10 week assessment metabolic change . Screening Visit The diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder confirm research psychiatrist use DSM IV criterion . A physical examination perform medical history , vital sign , weight , waist/hip circumference , EKG demographic information obtain . Demographic information also include date onset duration diabetes mellitus . Laboratory measure include CBC , fast glucose , insulin , cholesterol ( total , HDL LDL ) , triglyceride , hemoglobin A1C leptin . Plasma also obtain assay clozapine , norclozapine , olanzapine concentration screen visit . Baseline Assessment : The following scale complete baseline comprise treatment efficacy battery : Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) , Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) , Clinical Global Impression Scale ( CGI ) , Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM-D ) , Global Assessment Scale ( GAS ) , Fatigue Scale Inventory ( FSI ) Quality Life Scale ( QOL ) . Safety Assessments : Vital sign , weight , waist/hip circumference perform visit ( week 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 10 3 month follow-up ) . Side effect monitor baseline week 2 , 4 , 6 10 use SAFTEE ( Levine Schooler 1986 ) . EPS evaluate baseline week 2 , 4 , 6 4 week follow-up use Simpson-Angus Scale , Barnes Akathisia Scale , Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) . EKG perform baseline , week 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 . A patient discontinue study QTc interval great 450 . Changes medication record throughout study include change diabetes medication ( week 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 10 3-month follow-up ) . Energy Expenditure Dietary Assessment : Patients ask wear accelerometer ( Actigraph model 7164 ) obtain objective measure physical activity . This single channel accelerometer measure record vertical acceleration range 0.05 2 G 's frequency response 0.25 2.50 hertz . These parameter detect normal body motion filter high frequency movement vibration . The accelerometer position waist worn four consecutive day except sleep water ( i.e . swim take shower ) . The raw data read process custom data process program estimate energy expenditure . Patients instruct complete four-day food record ass dietary intake . Food record review completeness analyze use Nutrition Data System ( NDS ) . Energy expenditure dietary intake assess baseline , week 4 6 3 month follow-up . Subject Recruitment : The Freedom Trail Clinic well establish procedure identify , refer recruit subject research . Each week clinician research staff meet discuss research project currently conduct open enrollment . Using information , clinician approach patient deem appropriate research meet inclusion criterion . If patient express interest participate research , clinician completes Clinician Referral Form refer patient appropriate research assistant additional information regard study . A member research team meet subject explain study protocol , include review risk potential benefit . Patients express interest first meet evaluate competency provide inform consent physician member research team . Competence provide consent assess research psychiatrist use Assessment Capacity Participate Clinical Research form . Patients judge competent ask meet principal investigator review study protocol consent form patient obtain informed consent . A copy study consent form provide patient time . In addition , prospective subject must ultimately score 100 % correct score True/False quiz inform consent study interested participating . Potential Risks : Ziprasidone produce serious adverse effect animal human safety study . No consistent abnormality vital sign , laboratory , EEG emerge . Prolongation QTC EKG observe ziprasidone treatment . In clinical trial , side effect occur rate great 2x placebo . Nausea , vomiting , anxiety , headache , dyspepsia , somnolence , orthostatic hypotension , tachycardia , insomnia , akathisia , EPS may potential side effect . Benefits : It know ziprasidone add clozapine olanzapine help subject 's mood , motivation , hallucination , unusual experience . Other patient may benefit study find ziprasidone add clozapine olanzapine useful treating symptom schizophrenia . Protection Human Subjects : Principal member research team complete certification protection human subject clinical trial . The clinical protocol submit approval institutional review board Massachusetts Department Mental Health . Potential subject refer clinician . Clinicians ask sign statement verifies patient interested participating , understand participation voluntary , understands decline participation affect treatment facility . A member research team meet patient explain study protocol , include review risk potential benefit . A copy study consent form provide patient time share family member residential staff . Patients continue express interest first meet evaluate physician capacity provide inform consent . Patients judge competent ask meet principal investigator co-investigator review study protocol consent form patient obtain informed consent . Each subject enroll study ask sign authorization release information clinician . Upon consent , letter send clinician notification study enrollment , duration study dose duration study medication . All laboratory work physical assessment perform study either conduct review research physician . Side effect vital sign monitor routinely research assistant . Should abnormal lab value adverse event occur course subject 's participation , research physician would notify immediately value consult proceed patient care . Furthermore , subject 's clinician would also inform result .</detailed_description>
