	<brief_summary>A probiotic bacterial strain test randomize , double blind , placebo control clinical trial 54 healthy male volunteer . Half volunteer receive dietary supplement half placebo 6 week prior exposure solar-simulated UV irradition ( 2x1,5MED ) . Blister roof skin biopsy recover 1 , 4 10 day UV exposure unirradiated irradiated skin use immunohistochemical analysis mixed epidermal cell lymphocyte reaction</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Langerhans cell ( LC ) , dendritic cell ( DC ) epidermis , constitute first line immune defense environmental attack . Under steady state condition , LC turnover low . The LCs reside epidermis immature state distinguish epidermal cell surface expression HLA-DR , CD1a langerin . Upon stimulation inflammatory mediator LCs activate acquire CCR7 expression , chemokine receptor CCL21 mediate migration lymph node . Moreover , activate LCs display mature phenotype characterize increased expression co-stimulatory molecule acquisition maturation marker facilitate interaction T-cells aid elicitation immune response . It long know , addition carcinogenic via DNA damage mutation , solar UV radiation induces local systemic immune suppression represent major risk skin cancer induction progression sun-exposed area . The process mostly relate direct LC damage induction apoptosis impairment antigen-presenting function . Moreover , UV radiation elicit inflammatory response subsequent recruitment immune cell , include CD36+ monocytic cell . These cell colonize epidermis day follow UV exposure major source immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 . All mechanism ultimately lead impaired cell-mediated reaction establishment immune tolerance . Nutritional intervention , particularly dietary antioxidant vitamin , propose protect UV-induced skin damage certain extent skin cancer occurrence . In recent year , increase interest probiotic , define live microorganism , consume adequate amount , confer health benefit upon host . Particular focus specie lactic acid bacteria include Lactobacilli Bifidobacteria part natural human intestinal microbiota . Indeed , well document endogenous intestinal microbiota play crucial role immune maturation , gut integrity defense pathogen . Recently , show probiotic bacteria possess ability modulate immune system local systemic level thereby improve immune defense mechanism and/or down-regulate immune disorder intestinal inflammation allergy . The Probiotic use dietary supplement , isolate healthy adult microbiota show strong anti-pathogenic activity wide range entero-pathogens . Furthermore , pre-clinical study demonstrate maintain epidermal LC density . Here , analyze , randomize double blind , placebo control , clinical trial , whether dietary supplement could also modulate cutaneous immune homeostasis solar-simulated UV exposure humans.For purpose , analyze whether dietary supplement could interfere LC allostimulatory function activation/maturation phenotypic status skin DC , solar-simulated UV irradiation .</detailed_description>
