	<brief_summary>Some people expose HIV-1 virus capable either control completely prevent viral infection . Multiple genetic factor may contribute prevent control HIV-1 infection . The purpose study analyze immune system responses individual expose HIV-1 remain uninfected .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examining Factors That May Influence Resistance HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Even repeat exposure HIV-1 , individual appear resistant infection . The exact mechanism resistance , however , remain unknown . The relative risk HIV-1 infection appear depend various factor : route transmission , viral load infect donor , nature extent exposure , presence sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) , genetic immunological status expose individual . This last factor may explain inherent ability people remain uninfected despite repeated exposure HIV-1 . Immune response HIV-1 expose uninfected individual sometimes characterize specific cytotoxic CD8 T cell response without antibody response , suggest resistance may , part , mediate HIV-1 specific T cell . Exposed uninfected individual may also genetically protect , case key genes—possibly link immune responses—may lead resistance HIV-1 . A clearer understanding role individual 's genetic immune-mediated resistance HIV-1 infection need provide important information advance preventive HIV vaccine design . The purpose study examine immune response individual expose HIV-1 , remain uninfected . Through use highly sensitive technology , low level immune responses viral level evaluate . The study also compare genetic profile , exposure characteristic , donor viral load , STIs , sexual behavior among participant . In infected member serodiscordant couple , HIV-1 virus examine sequence . This observational study last approximately 24 month . Screening involve least one visit occur least 8 week prior study entry . Eligible participant fall one three group : - Group 1 include individual expose HIV-1 remain uninfected . - Group 2 include HIV infect regular sexual partner Group 1 member . - Group 3 include HIV uninfected individual couple expose HIV-1 . Study visit occur every 3 month total 8 visit . At visit , participant verify address location , complete standardize questionnaire sexual behavior , receive HIV safe sex counsel free condom . Blood urine collect test HIV , STIs , pregnancy . All participant undergo review medical history physical examination , include genital exam male females pelvic exam female . At select visit , participant may opt provide additional sample urine , saliva , genital secretion , breastmilk , feces research purpose . Groups 1 3 HIV test first study visit ; Group 2 HIV testing , assess CD4 cell count study visit . Participants require clinical care management HIV STIs either treat study site refer appropriate care .</detailed_description>
