	<brief_summary>We investigate maternal embryonic factor woman recurrent implantation failure , undergo IVF/ ICSI treatment . Women achieve pregnancy three embryo transfer procedures undergo endometrial biopsy window implantation natural cycle . During next treatment cycle aspirate endometrial secretion perform doppler ultrasound investigation a. uterina . Moreover , investigate cytokine expression transfer embryo culture medium .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale : Despite advance IVF procedure transfer embryos high morphological quality embryo , pregnancy rate IVF remain around 30 % per embryo transfer procedure . Failure transfer embryo implant remain important limit factor determine vitro fertilization ( IVF ) intra cytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) success rate . If progress make improve implantation rate , great understanding factor determine successful implantation require . Recurrent implantation failure IVF may due endometrial , embryo problem . All woman enter IVF program undergo pre-conceptional counsel pre-treatment blood withdrawal hormonal investigation investigation uterine cavity ultrasound examination , hysteroscopy endometrial biopsy . The data generate pre-treatment screening potentially enable factor predictive implantation failure identify . In addition , study IVF cycle increase knowledge factor endometrial embryo factor involve implantation failure , aid characterization different cause distress clinical problem . On basis data , rational intervention design improve outcome design test . Objective : To delineate pre-treatment predictor recurrent implantation failure , characterize different phenotype woman suffer problem study relative importance maternal embryonic cause implantation failure . Study design : Prospective , control cohort study . Study population : 50 woman receive least 3 embryo transfer previous IVF cycle carry within UMC Utrecht , without achieve clinical pregnancy . The control group 'normal implanters ' consists 30 woman previously readily conceive follow ICSI treatment severe male subfertility . Main study parameters/endpoints : 1 . Retrospective analysis screen parameter , include analysis endometrial biopsy material Noyes criterion endometrial dating , uterine natural killer ( uNK ) cell count dietary/ lifestyle parameter obtain questionnaire pre-conceptional counseling . 2 . Analysis uNK cell count obtain luteal phase endometrial biopsy prior treatment cycle . 3 . Analysis endometrial secretion embryo culture medium cytokine expression profile measure time embryo transfer subsequent IVF cycle : comparison normal profile identify ICE study . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Much data analyse collected routine clinical work ( pre-conceptional screening ) . Women recurrent implantation failure embark IVF cycle invite participate study undergo additional investigation . This include endometrial biopsy prior treatment cycle , endometrial fluid aspiration prior embryo transfer subsequent treatment cycle . No negative effect pregnancy rate intervention report . The theoretical risk associate aspiration endometrial secretion embryo transfer might disruption embryo implantation . However , group develop technique , previously show , disrupt process implantation .</detailed_description>
