	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose belinostat give together azacitidine treat patient advanced hematologic cancer disease . Belinostat may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving belinostat together azacitidine may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose PXD101 ( belinostat ) give combination azacitidine ( azacitidine utilize dose range effect cellular differentiation know predominant ) patient advance hematologic cancer disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Identify additive synergistic effect regimen pharmacodynamic parameter , include apoptosis re-expression specific target gene . II . Assess evidence clinical activity ( complete remission , partial remission , hematologic improvement , stable disease ) regimen patient . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study belinostat follow randomize study . Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) belinostat intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos belinostat maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . After MTD determine , additional patient myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) acute myeloid leukemia ( trilineage dysplasia arise MDS ) randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive azacitidine SC day 1-5 . Arm II : Patients receive azacitidine arm I belinostat MTD IV 30 minute day 1-5 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After receive one course , patient randomize arm I may crossover receive treatment arm II . For patient enrol randomized portion study , bone marrow aspirate obtain baseline , course 1 correlative study . Samples examine gene expression analysis p15 p21 , DNA methylation p15INK4B , apoptosis RT-PCR flow cytometry . Pharmacodynamic assay also perform . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
