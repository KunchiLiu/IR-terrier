	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel flavopiridol , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Flavopiridol may also help docetaxel work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . This phase II trial study well give docetaxel follow flavopiridol work treat patient refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Flavopiridol Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate patient refractory , metastatic pancreatic cancer treat weekly , sequential docetaxel flavopiridol . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine time progression overall survival patient treat regimen . II . Assess toxicity regimen . OUTLINE : This non-randomized , open-label , prospective study . Patients receive docetaxel IV 30 minute follow 4-6 hour later flavopiridol IV 60 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
