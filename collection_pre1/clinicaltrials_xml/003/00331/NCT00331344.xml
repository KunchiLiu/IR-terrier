	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity combination ixabepilone , mitoxantrone hydrochloride , prednisone patient hormone-refractory metastatic prostate cancer progress taxane-based chemotherapy . ( Phase I ) II . Assess efficacy , measure reduction prostate-specific antigen , regimen patient . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate overall safety regimen second-line chemotherapy patient . II . Evaluate objective response rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , open label , dose-escalation study mitoxantrone hydrochloride ixabepilone follow phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute ixabepilone IV 3 hour day 1 oral prednisone twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day ≥ 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos mitoxantrone hydrochloride ixabepilone maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . PHASE II : Patients receive mitoxantrone hydrochloride ixabepilone MTD determine phase I prednisone phase I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
