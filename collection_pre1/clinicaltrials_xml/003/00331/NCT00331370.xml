	<brief_summary>Damage small blood vessel consequence , also precede high blood pressure . Such damage , measure disturbance vessel retina ( back eye ) strong predictor heart disease stroke . South Asian people one high rate hypertension world ( 30 % adult ) . In Pakistan , usually severe , undetected untreated . The Wellcome Trust already fund study blood pressure control adults child population . We propose substudy , take photographs retina making measurement vessel , determine whether blood pressure relate change occur early age young child family history high blood pressure compare without , whether change predict increase blood pressure time , whether , adult , change reverse blood pressure treatment . The hypothesis study : young offspring South Asian people hypertension disturb microcirculation , assessed abnormality retinal vessel , compare offspring normotensive parent . Our 2nd hypothesis : Abnormal retinal vascular geometry improve proportionately achieve reduction BP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The role microcirculation increasingly recognize etiopathogenesis cardiovascular disease . Delays recognition part due difficulty study microcirculation non-invasively , large number individual . Retinal vessel provide easily accessible “ window ” microcirculation . Abnormalities retinal vasculature show associated cardiovascular risk factor cause mortality . Non-invasive assessment retinal circulation present valuable opportunity study structure function microvasculature Aims project To compare geometry retinal microvasculature 1 ) hypertensive v normotensive adult , 2 ) child age 10 14 year hypertensive parent ( test group ) versus normotensive parent ( control group ) , , 3 ) ass impact blood pressure lower change 2 year . Primary outcome would abnormal retinal geometry define composite outcome ) abnormal arteriolar length : diameter ratio ( measure relative arteriolar narrowing ) , b ) narrow branch angle ( indicator arteriolar rarefaction ) , c ) disturb junction exponent ( marker endothelial dysfunction . Significance study If successful , work could extend address future question , include predictive value abnormality development diabetes hypertension well CVD ; explore role microvascular disturbance disease etiology , assess impact drug therapy abnormality relationship outcomes South Asian population</detailed_description>
