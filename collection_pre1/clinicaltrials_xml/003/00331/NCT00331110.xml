	<brief_summary>The goal project assess effect ankle strap effectiveness laterally-wedged insole ankle strap reduce knee symptom improve static dynamic low limb biomechanics . Using repeated measure , modify cross-over design , follow aim hypothesis address : Biomechanical Hypotheses 1 . Use insole ankle strap significantly alters hip-knee-ankle ( HKA ) angle towards 180Â° talar valgus angulation . 2 . Use insole ankle strap significantly reduce peak knee external varus moment gait . 3 . Use insole ankle strap significantly reduces foot external rotation ( out-toeing ) widen base gait analysis . 4 . The radiographic HKA angle tilt angle talus predict knee peak external varus moment gait . Clinical Hypotheses 1 . The use insole ankle strap two-week period reduce knee pain ( Visual analogue scale , Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Survey ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study How An Ankle Strap Changes Effects Insole Treatment Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee common cause pain disability medial compartment involve frequently . If conservative mechanical therapy could reduce knee OA symptom , risk patient might minimize reduction use pharmacotherapy surgery . A lateral heel wedge strap ankle joint report induce similar therapeutic effect proximal tibial osteotomy . It presume mechanism involve correction genu varum . However , effect static low limb mechanical axis dynamic knee adduction moment , risk factor knee OA symptom progression , assess , mechanism effect currently unknown . The propose protocol would compare low limb mechanical alignment ( measure radiographic hip-knee-ankle angle ) dynamic knee varus moment ( measure 3-dimensional gait analysis ) without strap insole understand mechanism effect subject knee OA . Additionally , protocol would assess analgesia whether use insole reduces know knee joint unloading compensatory mechanism gait . Through measurement radiographic low limb alignment , dynamic knee varus moment , ankle/foot static dynamic angle , model would develop relate radiographs dynamic moment , potentially allow great risk stratification knee OA development progression use radiograph . In addition elucidate mechanism effect insole develop model radiographic interpretation , protocol would fist study insole involve non-Japanese subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects age 45 include predominantly medial compartment knee OA American College Rheumatology criterion , medial knee pain rat least 40/100mm visual analogue scale day month one past 3 month . Potential subject body mass index ( BMI ) great 35 exclude avoid potential confound effect increase weight height insole . Other exclusion criterion include : known injury surgery involve bone cartilage knee ankle may alter gait , history factor might alter response use laterally wedge insole ( e.g . great similar reduction lateral compare medial femorotibial jont space width posterioranterior radiograph , tibial osteotomy , congenital foot problem , fuse joint , foot deformity , know limitation range motion subtalar joint ) , know neuromuscular disease , comorbid disease might confound gait analysis ( e.g . hip OA , ankle OA , hallux rigidus , valgus deformity midfoot , symptomatic deformity foot , advance arthroplasty hindfoot , previous ankle arthrodesis , unable walk without gait aid ) , current use orthotic insole , inability comply study protocol .</criteria>
