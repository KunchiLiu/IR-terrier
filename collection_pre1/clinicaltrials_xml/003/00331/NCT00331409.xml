	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Everolimus imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Everolimus may also block blood flow tumor . Giving everolimus together imatinib mesylate may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give everolimus together imatinib mesylate work treat patient metastatic unresectable kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Everolimus Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Estimate proportion patient previously treat metastatic unresectable clear cell carcinoma kidney progression free ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] , stable disease [ SD ] ) 3 month treatment everolimus imatinib mesylate . Secondary - Estimate median time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine proportion patient whose best overall response CR , PR , SD , progressive disease . - Evaluate mean range maximum percent reduction tumor size . - Describe toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate oral everolimus daily begin day 1 continue absence disease progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 43 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
