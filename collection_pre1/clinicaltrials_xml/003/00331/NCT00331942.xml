	<detailed_description>General Information Antibodies specific response `` foreign '' antigen , usually detectable serum within 5-7 day initial exposure . However , case suppression specific immune response , case tumor . To date , report serum antibody associate cancer . Some tumor , surgically remove study find infiltrates T lymphocytes antibody bound tumor cell . These antibody ( specific immune response ) assume form later stage tumor growth , however , even case , serum antibody report ( probably due mostly `` absorbed '' tumor mass ) . Since mutation normal cell lead malignant cell mass involve change structure function cell , could assume immune system recognize change antigenic determinates respond ; , suppression cause tumor would reason lack antibody . If immune suppression could overcome , vitro , could lead formation antibody detectable serum ( We call process Cimmunology ) . Identifying structure antibody bind , look correlation tumor pathology antibody ' specificity – could provide additional information tumor – via blood test . 1.2 Future CAAb Test The Cimmunology base test comprise in-vitro stimulation step antibody detection step . The assay use find cancer associate antibody Breast cancer patient . Identification Breast cancer associate antibody could provide clinician additional immunological antigenic information regard patient 's condition medical status . The Cimmunology process comprise blood collection process step incubation ( special stimulation `` tube '' call CimTube ) period humid , 37oC incubator 5 % CO2 . The test detection specific antibody ELISA base , include different potentially interesting antigen . The relevant medical pathological information , collect form patient 's file , enable detailed analysis test result . 0 STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary objective To find Cancer Associated Antibodies 2.2 Effectiveness To determine ability Cimmunology process lead vitro antibody production , ability ELISA assay detect antibody , establish relationship ELISA result clinical / pathological status patient . The statistical significance CAAb test result determine . 3.0 STUDY POPULATIONS AND PATIENT SELECTION 3.1 Study Population 3.1.1 Breast cancer patient The study population include subject diagnose suspected breast cancer , i.e . positive biopsy , prior surgical procedure ( anti-cancer treatment ) . 3.1.2 Control group The control group include patient , breast cancer center appropriate care unit , negative Mammography last 3 month . 3.2 Participating Centers 3.2.1 General – The study base multi-centers participation . 3.2.2 Locations – All site within Hospitals , either Breast Cancer center relevant specific unit responsible provide care BC patient . The minimum number site study 2 max 10 . STUDY DESIGN 4.1 Overall Description The current study comparative observational two-arm study , involve consecutive Breast cancer patient study duration , age match control subject . The purpose study assess effectiveness CAAb test detect Breast cancer associate antibody . Subjects screen potential participation study , accord inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients recruit asked sign inform consent form . The data patient include parameter clinical pathological state patient , result CimTube culture step experimental kit . The effectiveness CAAb test assess evaluate statistical significance CAAb test use . The study utilize three step group-sequential design two interim one final analysis use O'Brian-Fleming ' boundary . The data collection may stop first second interim analysis bound reach . This could substantially decrease number patient time study , slightly increase maximum number patient . ( See Sample size consideration ) . We use 1:2 ratio cancer control patient decrease necessary number cancer patient main limiting factor . The sponsor conduct interim analysis , follow first third second third Breast cancer case sample size recalculate accordingly obtain estimate mean variance test two group . Therefore , least 100 patient enrol study . The control group 200 patient . 4.2 Study Procedure In hospital , First , identify study patient sign inform consent form , Eligibility Form fill ( see appendix B ) , bar-coded . Patient demographic clinical information acquire patient ’ medical file , include age , country origin , medical history result test do lead diagnostic evaluation Breast cancer ( relevant control group ) record appropriate , bar-coded , pre-study case report form ( see appendix C , CRF-BC CRF-BC-Control ) . The report either electronic ( dedicate secure internet site ) via hard copy . A hard copy record keep department . The study anonymous Department keep name patient without revel investigator study sponsor . The Study Sponsor provide tubes barcode label monitoring . The doctor/ nurse/ phlebotomist collect three heparin vacuum tube ( 20-24 ml ) , label ( bar-code ) , fill initial step `` Sample follow-up form '' ( SFF ) ( see appendix D ) . The tubes blood package double seal container ( provide sponsor ) . The department notify designate shipper collect blood 1 hour time sample . For BC sample two age match control ( +/- 3 year ) recruit . Transportation Hospital Handling Lab The blood transport room temperature ( 18-250C ) , accord relevant regulation , laboratory . Transportation time 6 hour . Times record SFF . In blood handle laboratory : The blood handle laboratory ( locate 200km collection site ) isolate PBMC ( Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) put Cimmunology culture within 20 hour form sample time ( fill time SFF ) . The detailed protocol Cimmunology medium provide Lab Discoveries participate laboratory ( applicable ) . All hospital Israel send blood sample laboratory Lab Discoveries . After culture step , culture fluid collect frozen -80 , properly label aliquot . The frozen sample send diagnostic laboratory antibody test . In diagnostic laboratory : Antibody test , ELISA , prepare use different antigen . The sample test response two antigen identify past , additional new one . All data permanently record directly dedicate computer . For sample antibody result put coded patient file . The result analyze statistician expertise cancer population study . At Hospital , post surgery : 2-3 week surgery , CRO collect patient 's file result pathology lab relevant information nature state tumor remove surgery . These result record dedicated secure internet site print bar-coded CRFs keep Department . 9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The present study comparative observational two-arm study , involve consecutive Breast cancer patient study duration , age match control subject . The main purpose study assess effectiveness CAAb test . This effectiveness measure Fisher ' distance ( often call “ effect size ” ) define Where m1 mean value test control , m2 mean value Breast cancer patient , |m1-m2| denotes absolute value difference ( m1-m2 ) , common estimate standard deviation distribution test one group ( control Breast cancer ) . 9.1 Statistical Hypothesis Null Hypothesis : There relationship presence absence BC CAAb i.e . d=0 Alternative hypothesis : The expectation CAAb cancer population differ control population… . i.e . m1 equal m2 Since sign difference important test two-sided . 9.2 General Considerations According previous result , assume 1 . The distribution test result group close Normal may transform Normal log-transformation . 2 . The variance distribution two group approximately equal 3 . Having mind pilot study consider result significant two-sided p-value 0.1 less . The bound 0.1 instead 0.05 chosen decrease chance random exclusion potentially informative test . When decide continuation study correction multiple comparison assume . However , result present without correction use FDR Benjamini &amp; Hochberg approach ( Benjamini , Hochberg 1995 ) . Where confidence limit appropriate , confidence level 95 % . 9.3 Sample Size The sample size calculate use relevant information previous study Peptides P3 P1 Breast cancer . There information literature regard cancer associate antibody . The sample size calculate three step sequential group design two side significance 0.1 0.05 , power 0.8 , cancer : control ratio 1:2 , D 0.5 . The calculation use standard formula sample size necessary comparison mean value two independent group t-test . The correction group-sequential procedure O ’ Bien Fleming ’ test increase number 1.017 1.027 significance value 0.05 0.1 , negligible sample size . ( see C. Jennison , B.W.Turnbill Group Sequential Methods Applications Clinical Trials Chapmann &amp; Hall ( 2000 ) Boca Raton FL US pp30 table 2.4 ) . The calculation do use NCSS-PASS software . 9.4 Endpoints Evaluation 9.4.1 Effectiveness Analysis A calculate D 0.3 0.5 mark test non effective use alone . However , may important combination test part multivariate test procedure . Tests &lt; 0.3 consider non-effective . A test , combination test , &gt; 0.5 mark CAAb test effective .</detailed_description>
