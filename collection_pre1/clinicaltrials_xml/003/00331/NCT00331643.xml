	<brief_title>Ixabepilone Treating Young Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate ixabepilone various strata recurrent solid malignant tumor childhood young adulthood , include follow : Embryonal alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma , osteosarcoma , Ewing 's sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor , synovial sarcoma malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor , Wilms ' tumor , neuroblastoma . II . Determine time progression tumor stratum . III . Prospectively evaluate feasibility utility automate volumetric tumor measurement patient measurable pulmonary metastasis , descriptively compare volumetric measurement 1-dimensional ( RECIST criterion ) 2-dimensional ( WHO criteria ) measurement . IV . Define describe toxicity ixabepilone . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease ( Ewing 's sarcoma/ peripheral neuroectodermal tumor v osteosarcoma v alveolar embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma v Wilms ' tumor v neuroblastoma v synovial sarcoma/malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ) . Patients receive ixabepilone IV 1 hour day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every year 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 120 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
