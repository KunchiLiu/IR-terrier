	<brief_title>Rapid Detection Group B Strep- 35-37 Week Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early Onset Group B Strep ( GBS ) neonatal infection one lead infection newborn , nearly acquire vertical transmission time childbirth . Most case prevent identify woman colonize GBS vaginal-rectal area give colonized woman prophylactic antibiotic labor . About 15 -20 % woman colonize nearly woman asymptomatic . Because take 48 hour obtain culture result , currently recommend perform culture clinic 3 - 5 week prior due date prophylaxing woman colonize GBS antibiotic come labor . There several downside strategy . All woman present preterm labor treat culture result become available ( overtreatment ) , woman go labor wait culture result treat ( overtreatment ) , prior study show 33 % woman positive 35 week , negative birth ( overtreatment ) 10 % negative 35 week positive birth ( undertreatment ) , lose missing culture result ( over- undertreatment ) . Using microfluidics fluorescent PCR , new test identify GBS reliably 30 45 minute vitro . This study propose evaluate clinical performance ( sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value ) microfluidic rapid GBS technique select woman present 35 - 37 week antenatal clinic University Michigan compare standard culture .</detailed_description>
