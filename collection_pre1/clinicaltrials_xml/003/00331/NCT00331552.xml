	<brief_summary>Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) together trastuzumab may better way block tumor growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Doxorubicin Hydrochloride Liposome , Cyclophosphamide , Trastuzumab Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine optimal tolerate dose Doxil give combination daily oral cyclophosphamide patient stage IV breast cancer . ( Phase I ) II . To determine efficacy ( overall clinical response rate ) optimal tolerate dose Doxil give combination daily oral cyclophosphamide herceptin ( HER2 neu positive patient ) patient stage IV breast cancer . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess treatment related toxicity associate dose level regimen assess efficacy ( overall clinical response rate ) . ( Phase I ) II . To assess safety ( treatment relate toxicity ) optimal tolerate dose Doxil give combination daily oral cyclophosphamide herceptin ( HER2 neu positive patient ) patient stage IV breast cancer . ( Phase II ) III . To assess time progression overall survival follow treatment Doxil daily oral cyclophosphamide herceptin ( HER2 neu positive patient ) . ( Phase II ) IV . To compare response rate patient heavily pretreated response rate patient less heavily pretreated . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome follow phase II feasibility study . Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide daily day 1-28 pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 4-6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient HER2/neu 3+ disease may also receive trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute weekly every 3 week discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
