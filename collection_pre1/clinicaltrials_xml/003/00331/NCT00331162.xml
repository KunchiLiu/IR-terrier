	<brief_summary>The purpose research study compare effect two commonly use anti-T cell induction agent ( alemtuzumab rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin ) prevent rejection kidney pancreas transplant patient . Alemtuzumab Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve treat certain type cancer ( leukemia ) , Thymoglobulin® ( rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin ) approve anti-rejection treatment , neither drug FDA approve administration time transplantation help prevent rejection . Even , many transplant center use medication time transplantation believe use help decrease risk develop rejection follow kidney pancreas transplantation . Which drug might better know . Subjects receive either alemtuzumab ( one administration ) rabbit anti-thymocyte ( 3 7 dos ) within first week transplantation . Subjects assign either alemtuzumab rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin group chance . The two group compare see meaningful difference survival , organ function , side effect , quality life . The follow-up care transplant subject study patient study , except quality life questionnaire ( estimate take 10 minute complete ) complete time transplant year 2 select schedule clinic visit . A retrospective chart review occur 3-5 year post-transplant follow incidence chronic rejection , patient graft survival graft function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Alemtuzumab Versus Anti-thymocyte Globulin Help Prevent Rejection Kidney Pancreas Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anti-Thymocyte Globulin , rabbit ( r-ATG , Thymoglobulin® ) polyclonal antibody T-lymphocytes use prevention treatment acute allograft rejection . r-ATG induction therapy effective prevent acute allograft rejection , however usual 7-14 day course involve extensive clinical monitoring costly . Recent study suggest small cumulative dos efficacious induction therapy , may advantage decrease adverse effect associate agent ( leukopenia thrombocytopenia ) . Our program subsequently modify r-ATG induction regimen November 2001 give dos alternate day least three dos achieve excellent result . However , regimen somewhat complex require central venous access administration , pre-medication administration prevent infusion-related reaction , monitor vital sign infusion . Alemtuzumab ( Campath® ) humanize monoclonal antibody CD52 FDA approve treatment B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) , also use immunosuppression induction time solid organ transplant anti-rejection therapy . CD52 present lymphocyte , macrophage , monocyte , NK cell , cause antibody-dependent cell lysis follow bind alemtuzumab CD52 surface antigen . Alemtuzumab produce significant lymphocyte depletion similar r-ATG , investigator begin evaluate precondition agent tolerance protocol ( use low-dose maintenance immunosuppression ) solid organ transplantation . While study show significant tolerogenic potential alemtuzumab , one two 20-30 mg dos alemtuzumab produce similar degree lymphocyte depletion r-ATG administration . Based preliminary data transplant recipient prior safety data obtain safety efficacy study alemtuzumab patient rheumatoid arthritis , US transplant center change use r-ATG alemtuzumab primary induction agent . Most center ( notably Wisconsin Northwestern , 500 kidney pancreas patient receive alemtuzumab , personal communication Dixon Kaufman , Northwestern ) use one two dos alemtuzumab induction , follow traditional 2-3 drug maintenance immunosuppressive regimen ( rather low-dose immunosuppression use tolerance protocol ) . Knechtle colleague University Wisconsin report comparable incidence acute rejection favorable graft survival 130 patient receive single intraoperative 30 mg dose ( +/- additional dose post-operative day 1 ) alemtuzumab compare historical cohort receive r-ATG , OKT3 , IL-2 receptor antagonist , induction . In addition , group find dramatically low incidence acute rejection patient experience delay graft function alemtuzumab group ( 9 % vs 45 % control group , p=0.0078 ) . The use alemtuzumab induction agent solid organ transplantation appeal . Only single intraoperative dose would require ( compare 2 6 additional dos r-ATG post-op ) , thereby eliminate necessity central venous access extensive clinical nurse monitoring . In addition , cost therapy would less alemtuzumab r-ATG . At WFUBMC , 18 recipient kidney kidney/pancreas transplant receive alemtuzumab 9 % six-month rejection rate . Our clinical experience suggest agent produce similar result ; however , prospective , randomize study compare safety efficacy alemtuzumab r-ATG report . Also , although alemtuzumab would offer significant medication cost saving r-ATG , impact overall cost care yet establish . A comparative study help u decide make alemtuzumab new standard care institution . The purpose study evaluate use alemtuzumab ( Campath-1H ) induction therapy kidney pancreas transplantation compare standard care , alternate-day r-ATG .</detailed_description>
