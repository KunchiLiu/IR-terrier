	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Giving radiation therapy use 3-dimensional ( 3-D ) image tumor help focus thin beam radiation directly tumor , give hypofractionated radiation therapy ( high dos shorter period time ) , may kill tumor cell few side effect . It yet know radiation therapy regimen effective treat prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study several different radiation therapy regimens compare well work treat patient stage II prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage II Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free survival ( DFS ) patient favorable-risk stage II prostate cancer treat hypofractionated v conventionally fractionate three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy ( 3D-CRT ) intensity-modulated radiotherapy ( IMRT ) . Secondary - Compare time local progression , freedom biochemical recurrence , disease-specific overall survival patient treat regimen . - Determine incidence gastrointestinal genitourinary toxic effect patient treat regimen . - Compare degree , duration , significant difference disease-specific health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) decrement , use Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite ( EPIC ) , patient treat regimen . - Determine whether anxiety and/or depression , measure Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25 ( HSCL-25 ) , decrease therapy improves DFS patient . - Determine whether incremental gain DFS outweigh decrement generic domain HRQOL ( i.e. , mobility , self care , usual activity , pain/discomfort , anxiety/depression ) patient treat regimen . - Conduct cost-utility analysis hypofractionated 3D-CRT IMRT prostate cancer therapy regimen show effective conventionally fractionate 3D-CRT IMRT improve DFS . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord Gleason score ( 2-4 v 5-6 ) , prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) level ( &lt; 4 ng/mL vs 4-9 ng/mL ) , plan radiotherapy modality ( three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy [ 3D-CRT ] v intensity-modulated radiotherapy [ IMRT ] ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo conventionally fractionate 3D-CRT IMRT daily 5 day week 8.2 week ( total 41 treatment ) . - Arm II : Patients undergo hypofractionated 3D-CRT IMRT daily 5 day week 5.6 week ( total 28 treatment ) . Quality life , anxiety , depression assess baseline 6 month 1 , 2 , 5 year start radiotherapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,067 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
