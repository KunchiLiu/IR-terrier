	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming , grow , come back . The use nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid may prevent colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase I trial study side effect best dose nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid prevent colorectal cancer patient high risk colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nitric Oxide-Releasing Acetylsalicyclic Acid Preventing Colorectal Cancer Patients High Risk Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate effect nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid aberrant cryptic focus ( ACF ) patient high risk colon cancer . Secondary - Determine pharmacokinetic profile drug patient . - Determine presence absence ACF patient . - Determine expression PGE2 , COX-1 , COX-2 , NF-kB , β-catenin colon tissue . - Determine safety tolerability long-term nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , parallel group study . Patients stratify accord gender race ( black v non-Hispanic white v Hispanic white vs Asian ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid twice daily 6 month . - Arm II : Patients receive nitric oxide-releasing acetylsalicyclic acid twice daily 6 month high dose arm I . - Arm III : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily 6 month . Patients undergo sigmoidoscopy baseline completion study treatment . Biopsies aberrant cryptic focus ( ACF ) non-ACF site collect sigmoidoscopy . Tissue examine biomarkers ( PGE_2 , COX , NF-kB , β-catenin ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 240 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
