	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Specialized radiation therapy ( RT ) , intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving intensity-modulated radiation therapy pelvis without chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well intensity-modulated radiation therapy pelvis without chemotherapy work treat patient endometrial cancer cervical cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy Pelvis With Without Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Endometrial Cancer Cervical Cancer That Has Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine transportability intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) multi-institutional set patient resect endometrial cervical cancer . - Compare efficacy , term reduce short-term bowel injury , IMRT versus standard treatment . - Assess adverse event related regimen . - Estimate rate local-regional control , distant metastasis , disease-free overall survival . - Evaluate chemotherapy compliance regimen patient cervical carcinoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord diagnosis ( cervical v endometrial cancer ) . All patient undergo intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) day , 5 day week , 5.5 week . Patients cervical cancer also receive cisplatin IV 30-60 minute day 1 2 . Treatment cisplatin repeat every 7 day 5 course ( radiotherapy ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week post-IMRT every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month year 3-5 , annually least 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 92 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
