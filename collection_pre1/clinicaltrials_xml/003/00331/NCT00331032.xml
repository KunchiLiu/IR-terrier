	<detailed_description>Over half global human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection occur among age 18-24 year young woman particularly high risk acquire genital herpes cause herpes simplex virus type 2 ( HSV-2 ) sexually transmit infection ( STI ) . This phase I , randomize , double blind , clinical trial twice-daily vaginal VivaGel™ ( n equal 40 ) versus placebo gel ( n equal 20 ) . The primary aim protocol test safety tolerability VivaGel™ young woman , long-term aim test efficacy compound prevent HSV-2 future phase II/III trial . A total 60 young woman age 18-24 , non-pregnant , previously sexually active , STI HIV free , San Francisco Kisumu , Kenya participate study . Eligibility screen include medical history , pelvic exam Pap smear , urine pregnancy test , HIV STI counsel testing , hematology test liver renal function test . Eligible participant undergo pelvic exam colposcopy . Vaginal swab collect evaluate H2O2-producing lactobacillus Gram stain , Chlamydia , gonorrhea , prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) ( confirm lack exposure semen ) . Endocervical sample collect measure immunological status . Blood collect conduct hematology liver renal function testing , plasma collect stored batch test . Subjects provide investigational product placebo , give Daily Study Record , instruct use product , complete Daily Study Record , report adverse event ( AEs ) . Follow-up visit occur Days 2 , 7 , 14 , 21 . The primary study objective determine safety tolerability VivaGel™ apply vaginally twice daily 14 day HIV negative STI-free young woman . Safety assessment , compare VivaGel™ group placebo gel group , include : incidence severity AEs , include genital tract sign symptom mucosal change observe colposcopy ; vaginal microflora , include colonization H2O2-producing lactobacillus ; laboratory parameter , include serum chemistry hematology . The tolerability assessment , compare VivaGel™ group placebo gel group include proportion participant discontinue product use due overt ( i.e . observable ) AEs , ascertain standardized questionnaire . The secondary objective study report effect VivaGel™ apply vaginally twice daily 14 day immune microenvironment low genital tract young woman . Specifically , test determine effect : number activation level endocervical immune cell population ; Secretory Leukocyte Protease Inhibitor ( SLPI ) level ; innate mucosal defense , include local level cytokine cervical secretion , Toll-Like Receptor ( TLR ) expression cervical immune cell ; presence expression level HIV co-receptors CCR5 CXCR4 , principal chemokine ligands endocervical immune cell .</detailed_description>
