	<brief_summary>Flavonoids one many class natural chemical find variety food . People high flavonoid blood level lowest rate coronary heart disease . This consider one reason high fruit vegetable consumption associate low rate heart disease , although know take flavonoid supplement provide protection eat fruit vegetable . The purpose study determine particular flavonoid supplement , call Isotonix OPC-3 , take daily basis , improve function arterial vessel . Arteries normally constrict eat high-fat meal . This study examine potential OPC-3 lessen constriction response . Approximately 25 people involve research project participation last 10 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Flavonoid Supplementation Endothelial Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose use supplement make NutraMetrix ( call OPC-3 ) , consist oligomeric proanthocyanidins derive grape seed , pine bark , bilberry , citrus red wine extract , determine effect endothelial function , lipoproteins inflammation . The primary outcome measure endothelial function assess digital response hyperemia use peripheral arterial tonometry , measure fast state single standardize high-fat meal , transient dysfunction expect occur . Secondary outcome measure lipid profile , hs-CRP , Lp-PLA2 . The recruitment population healthy volunteer . The design randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , cross-over trial last 10 week .</detailed_description>
