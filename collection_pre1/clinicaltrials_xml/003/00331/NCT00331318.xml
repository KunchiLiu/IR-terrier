	<brief_summary>This study determine apply electrical stimulation brain influence training perform finger movement . The study may provide information use design rehabilitation therapy people lose ability move part body , arm , leg , hand follow stroke . Healthy volunteer 18-50 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , MRI ( one do within last year ) , questionnaire evaluate memory attention pregnancy test woman become pregnant . Participants follow test procedure seven session 8 week : - Questionnaires test attention , fatigue mood , session - Surface electromyography : Electrodes file conductive gel tap skin one small hand muscle measure electrical activity muscle . - Transcranial magnetic stimulation : A wire coil hold scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil stimulate brain . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , subject may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . - Transcranial direct stimulation ( tDCS ) motor training : Small , wet sponge electrode apply head - one eye back head . A small electrical current pass . The subject may feel itch tingle sensation electrode see light flash . - Motor learn tDCS : tDCS repeat subject performs train task . The training task consist perform voluntary brisk thumb movement direction opposite TMS-induced movement direction , 30 minute . Training block 10-minute segment tDCS apply first 20 minute . - Behavioral measurement : Evaluation learn movement task .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Training lead performance improvement motor learn . Cortical plasticity associate training ( use-dependent plasticity , UDP ) contribute performance improvement brain lesion stroke . Recently , several interventional strategy propose enhance UDP , include pharmacological approach brain stimulation . The magnitude improvement identify technique limit . It would useful enhance UDP beyond limited effect previously propose intervention . One strategy recently propose enhance effect brain stimulation technique cerebral cortex metaplasticity . This strategy focus purposeful manipulation cortical activity apply brain stimulation . For example , previous work demonstrate magnitude increase cortical excitability elicit stimulation primary motor cortex ( M1 ) prominent stimulation apply hypoactive M1 . An initial down-regulation M1 activity ( ) amplifies effect subsequent intervention increase M1 activity , ( ii ) reduce inter-individual variability . It unknown metaplasticity strategy enhance beneficial effect anodal tDCS ( tDCS anodal ) training effect cortical excitability , issue scientific clinical interest , overall hypothesis protocol . Here , test hypothesis metaplasticity ( tDCS cathodal ) follow tDCS anodal plus motor training result prominent UDP control intervention . STUDY POPULATION 6 healthy adult volunteer parameter estimation plus 25 healthy adult volunteer ( total = 31 healthy adult volunteer ) DESIGN In protocol , down-regulation M1 activity accomplish apply tDCS cathodal , tool extensively described literature induce effect . Therefore , test effect metaplasticity intervention beneficial action tDCS anodal M1 combination motor training ( MT ) . After familiarization session , subject participate 6 randomized session cross-over design : 1 . Preconditioning tDCS cathodal follow Intervention tDCS anodal plus MT Purpose Target metaplasticity condition 2 . Preconditioning Sham follow Intervention Sham plus MT Purpose Effects motor train alone 3 . Preconditioning Sham follow Intervention tDCS anodal plus MT Purpose Mild improvement training effect 4 . Preconditioning tDCS cathodal follow Intervention Sham plus MT Purpose Effects tDCS cathodal alone MT 5 . Preconditioning tDCS anodal follow Intervention Sham plus MT Purpose Effects polarity tDCS effect 6 . Preconditioning tDCS anodal follow Intervention tDCS anodal plus MT Purpose Control metaplasticity condition MT consist brisk repetitive thumb movement direction opposite baseline direction thumb movement evoke focal transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) , well-characterized UDP protocol . The primary outcome measure reflect encode motor memory increase proportion TMS-evoked movement fall within target train zone ( TTZ ) function MT metaplasticity intervention .</detailed_description>
