	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Biological therapy , cellular adoptive immunotherapy , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Aldesleukin may stimulate white blood cell , include lymphokine-activated killer cell , kill tumor cell . Giving cellular adoptive immunotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well cellular adoptive immunotherapy work treat patient glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cellular Adoptive Immunotherapy Treating Patients With Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine feasibility , side effect , toxicity associate intracranial cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprise aldesleukin-stimulated lymphokine-activated killer cell patient glioblastoma multiforme . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient . - Compare survival patient contemporary historical control . OUTLINE : Patients undergo therapeutic craniotomy . Patients undergo leukapheresis obtain lymphokine-activated killer ( LAK ) cell 3-7 day therapeutic craniotomy OR 4-6 week therapeutic craniotomy . Patients receive cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprise aldesleukin-stimulated LAK cell intracranially time therapeutic craniotomy OR via Ommaya reservoir ( placed craniotomy ) sooner 4-6 week therapeutic craniotomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DISEASE CHARACTERISTICS : Diagnosis primary malignant glioblastoma multiforme ( i.e. , grade IV anaplastic astrocytoma ) Primary treatment ( surgery , radiation , and/or chemotherapy ) complete Candidate surgery willing undergo craniotomy No progressive recurrent disease No residual disease require reoperation , additional gamma therapy , modality PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : ECOG performance status ( PS ) 02 OR Karnofsky PS 70100 % ( i.e. , symptomatic , bedridden &lt; half wake day ) Life expectancy â‰¥ 2 month Not pregnant Negative pregnancy test U.S. resident No hematopoietic , hepatic , renal , cardiovascular , pulmonary laboratory value medical circumstance would preclude surgery aldesleukin therapy No serious concurrent medical psychiatric illness would preclude informed consent study treatment PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics At least 4 week since prior anticancer therapy recover Prior stereotactic gamma knife radiosurgery allow</criteria>
