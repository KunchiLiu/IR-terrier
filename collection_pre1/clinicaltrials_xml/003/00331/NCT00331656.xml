	<brief_summary>Non-invasive ventilation become increasingly important management patient acute respiratory failure . One major goal prevent need invasive ventilation , associate numerous complication . This study compare usefulness safety two noninvasive technique use Medical practice : Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation use face mask extrathoracic biphasic ventilation use cuirass . Each technique advantage disadvantage may suit patient . It therefore important compare two term effectiveness prevent invasive ventilation side effect profile , improve understanding expertise treatment patient respiratory failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Study Non-Invasive Mask Ventilation v Cuirass Ventilation Patients With Acute Respiratory Failure .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-invasive ventilation become frequent important treatment option patient acute respiratory failure , order avoid endotracheal intubation associate complication . Non-invasive technique include positive pressure mask ventilation , negative ( iron lung ) ventilation extrathoracic biphasic cuirass ventilation . However , large , prospective randomize trial compare technique lack . This prospective , randomize study compare effectiveness side effect non-invasive positive pressure mask ventilation v extrathoracic biphasic cuirass ventilation patient acute respiratory failure . Methods : Medical patient acute respiratory failure cause different etiology , require immediate endotracheal intubation , randomize receive either positive pressure via face mask extrathoracic biphasic ventilation via cuirass . Clinical response and/or need intubation mechanical ventilation assess throughout study . Cross-over alternative mode provide case intolerance lack response . Study endpoint : Need endotracheal intubation , ICU hospital mortality , length ventilation , length ICU hospital stay complication rate use two mode . Importance &amp; implication : No study yet compare two mode noninvasive ventilation acute respiratory failure . This study improve understand evidence base knowledge treatment patient acute respiratory failure .</detailed_description>
