	<brief_summary>The main purpose study compare drug level artesunate sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine find pregnant woman malaria drug level find non-pregnant woman study . In addition efficacy safety study drug determine pregnant woman baby .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Artesunate Plus Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine Pharmacokinetics , Efficacy , Gametocytes Carriage Birth Outcomes Pregnant Women With Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The resistance Plasmodium falciparum anti-malarial drug serious impediment control malaria , pose particular problem treatment pregnant woman , group especially vulnerable malaria ; pregnancy increase risk disease progression complication 10-fold increase malaria case fatality rate area low transmission . As falciparum parasite sequester placenta , pregnant woman show develop recrudescence 85 day quinine treatment , increase risk gametocyte carriage . Artemisinin-based combination therapy show improve cure rate delay antimalarial resistance . In human efficacy safety artesunate treatment malaria pregnancy study 1000 woman evidence foetal harm demonstrate . Quinine alternative currently available Mozambique treat malaria pregnancy however relatively little data available efficacy safety . There publish information pharmacokinetics SP pregnancy , however data show marked reduction bioavailability artesunate active metabolite , dihydroartemisinin . Thus , confident standard dosage regimens SP artesunate optimal treatment acute uncomplicated malaria pregnancy whether altered pharmacokinetics contribute SP-treatment failure observe pregnancy . This study create opportunity study whether pharmacokinetic property SP artesunate alter physiological change occur pregnancy .</detailed_description>
