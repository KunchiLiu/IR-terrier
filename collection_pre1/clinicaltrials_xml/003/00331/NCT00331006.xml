	<detailed_description>Hemophilia A hereditary blood clot disorder . It cause deficiency abnormality blood clot protein factor VIII . Individuals hemophilia A unable form blood clot stop bleed risk experience serious life-threatening bleeding episode . The common treatment disease intravenous replacement factor VIII . However , 30 40 % individual eventually develop inhibitor , antibody , replacement factor . In individual , immune system recognize replacement factor foreign attack , thereby counter potential benefit treatment . Some individual severe hemophilia A may undergo immune tolerance therapy ( ITT ) , receive replacement factor regular basis way body adjust factor stop inhibitor production . This treatment , however , always effective everyone . Preliminary research show rituximab , medication use treat non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , may successful suppress eliminate inhibitor develop . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness rituximab lowering level factor VIII inhibitor individual severe hemophilia A . This study enroll individual severe hemophilia A . At study entry , participant receive one intravenous dose factor VIII . Inhibitor level measure blood test 5 7 day follow procedure . If peak inhibitor level 5 Bethesda unit ( BU ) /mL , 5 9 day later participant begin receive rituximab intravenously week 4 week . Blood collect visit laboratory test . Two week follow last rituximab treatment , participant blood drawn inhibitor test ; test occur every 4 week Week 22 . If participant 's inhibitor level fall 5 BU/mL , participant receive repeat dose factor VIII , blood drawn 5 7 day later inhibitor test . Follow-up visit occur Weeks 36 , 52 , 100 , include physical examination , blood collection , monitor bleed event infection . Telephone interview conduce Weeks 64 , 76 , 88 monitor bleed event infection .</detailed_description>
