	<detailed_description>Feeding intolerance relatively common NICU . It manifest emesis , diarrhea , increase abdominal girth ( bloat ) , severe case necrotizing enterocolitis . Feeding intolerance complicates hospitalization , lengthen hospital stay , add substantially cost care . Feeding intolerance likely many cause . One cause may particularly common NICU atrophy intestinal mucosa , occur enteral fasting ( patient NPO ) . Significant intestinal villous atrophy occur NPO even 1-2 day ; even parenteral nutrition adequate . We develop method aim prevent intestinal villous atrophy neonate NPO . We accomplish preclinical test product , complete two Phase I clinical trial involve 60 neonate . Our preparation sterile , isotonic , solution simulates human amniotic fluid electrolyte composition , albumin concentration , two enterocyte growth factor present human amniotic fluid ; erythropoietin granulocyte colony-stimulating factor . We term product SAFEstart , use acronym Simulated Amniotic Fluid Enteral administration . SAFEstart test neonate never feed , mean prevent villous mucosal atrophy . However , yet test neonate develop feed intolerance several day week life . When feed intolerance develop patient , current treatment include change formula , continuous feeding , include use SAFEstart . It possible SAFEstart administration , 2.5 mL/kg enterally every three hour previously do preterm neonate begin first day life , would provide benefit old neonate acquire feed intolerance . If infant mucosal atrophy part feeding problem , growth factor SAFEstart might indeed result improved feeding tolerance . We propose Phase II exploratory trial among 20 neonate McKay-Dee NICU develop problem feed intolerance . Specifically , propose feed intolerance diagnose , 20 mL/kg/day SAFEstart administer ( every three hour gavage nipple feeding ) continue period one week , attempt resolve feed intolerance .</detailed_description>
