	<brief_title>ICTUS Study : International Citicoline Trial Acute Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The stroke brain attack one main health problem develop country . It third cause death main cause disability adult . Cerebral infarction make 80 % type stroke . After stroke , different evolution outcomes observe , several factor may influence outcome , age , cognitive impairment , psycho-social factor . The important prognostic factor acute ischemic stroke volume cerebral infarction severity baseline neurological deficit . In recent year , stroke consider real medical emergency , reason several clinical trial conduct find effective therapy . Among pharmacological therapy , two possible way treat ischemic stroke : treatment direct recanalize occluded artery , thrombolysis , neuroprotective drug . None neuroprotective drug attain international approval indication . Among reason failure obtain different drug test , must highlight problem derive toxicity drug evaluation criterion , well therapeutic window use . To evaluate drug treatment acute ischemic stroke , one must careful define schedule clinical trial , variable variable may consider primary endpoint . Several endpoint use different clinical trial develop , although use refer functional status degree disability patient , normally set 3 month stroke . After onset ischemic stroke brain , cascade event responsible neuronal disruption , neuronal membrane breakdown and/or neuronal apoptosis , specifically penumbra area . Therapies act block ischemic cascade , least partially , and/or stabilize neuronal membrane believe beneficial protect brain progressive effect ischemia . Among neuroprotective drug , new class drug , main representative citicoline . Citicoline monosodium exogenous form CDP-Choline , essential biosynthesis membrane phospholipid . The mechanisms action citicoline include stimulation biosynthesis phospholipid neuronal membrane , inhibition activity phospholipases , restoration enzymatic activity bound neuronal membrane , elevation brain level catecholamine . The previous clinical trial perform citicoline conclusive , positive result . In study , citicoline find similar safety profile compare placebo . The variety outcomes result different trial make difficult arrive consensus efficacy drug . That reason Pooling Data Analysis use updated individual patient data do , main objective determine effect citicoline improvement , functional neurological , patient acute ischemic stroke treat different dos citicoline 6 week follow-up period 6 week . The result obtain Pooling Data Analysis show odds ratio achieve complete recovery 33 % high citicoline-treated patient placebo-treated patient , best response obtain dose 2000 mg/d/6 week . The primary objective study determine effect recovery 3 month oral citicoline 2000 mg/d/6 week , 6 week treatment 6 week follow-up , patient moderate-to-severe acute ischemic stroke ( baseline NIHSS equal high 8 ) comparison placebo .</detailed_description>
