	<brief_title>Pyronaridine Artesunate ( 3:1 ) Children With Acute Uncomplicated Plasmodium Falciparum Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Plasmodium falciparum malaria kill one million people result 500 million case annually affect mainly young child pregnant woman . The economic consequence malaria enormous endemic region estimate USD 12 billion per year lose GDP loss 45 million year productive life due death disability . Malaria curable preventable , principal control strategy include rapid diagnosis , effective treatment personal protection bed net . Currently number antimalarial available , however two widely use drug , chloroquine sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine effective many part world due drug resistance . Artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACT ) effective today consider expert best antimalarial term efficacy low propensity resistance . Cost access appropriate quality raw material remain major issue currently available artemisinins . In order prevent occurrence drug resistance artemisinins address issue relatively short half-life , artemisins recommend give combination another antimalarial agent . In development programme , artemisinin , artesunate , partner establish antimalarial agent pyronaridine . The objective development programme pyronaridine artesunate combination develop three day oral therapy use child adult treat acute , uncomplicated malaria .</detailed_description>
