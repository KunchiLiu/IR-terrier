	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) estimate 582 000 woman die world-wide year due pregnancy related condition could prevent . Most deaths occur develop countries1 . Some underlying cause increase maternal morbidity mortality HIV-related . In South Africa antenatal HIV seroprevalence survey report infection rate 32 % , high among Sub-Saharan countries2 . According Saving Mothers Report ( NCCEMD ) pregnancy-related sepsis fourth commonest cause maternal mortality , AIDS second lead cause3 . Of 67 woman die HIV/AIDS 1998 , 41 die puerperal sepsis 54 % vaginal delivery 46 % caesarean section . It clear report extent HIV infection contribute severity sepsis . The clinical impression woman HIV infection high incidence post delivery morbidity HIV-negative woman . Proposed contributory factor include , low CD4 count associate impaired immunological function , obstetric complication sexually transmit infections3 . The puerperal sepsis rate 2-6 % study . It however much high woman bacterial vaginosis ( 14 % ) 2 deliver health institution ( 18 % ) 3 . Women HIV infection likely harbour BV sexually transmit infection . For reason generally accept HIV-positive woman increase risk puerperal infectious morbidity mortality independent mode delivery antiretroviral therapy . Di Lieto et al4 report 33.8 % incidence infectious morbidity follow emergency caesarean delivery . The incidence infectious morbidity report high HIV positive woman compare HIV negative woman ( Semprini et al . 1995 ) 5 . The role prophylactic antibiotic obstetric complication previously investigate especially woman preterm labour , prelabour rupture membrane , cardiac disease woman deliver caesarean section . There good evidence prophylactic antibiotic significantly reduce postpartum morbidity . In study prophylactic antibiotic largely administer intra-operatively . The question remain whether prophylactic antibiotic need give woman identify risk woman HIV infection . The identification biochemical ( laboratory ) /immune marker value time clinical intervention . The marker use predict sepsis determine level apoptosis neutrophil , neutrophil function , C-Reactive protein level , ESR level follow cytokine viz . TNF- , IL-1 , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 . Less clear role apoptosis 's dysregulation may play pathological immune state like sepsis , autoimmune disease , immunosuppressed state . The potential role apoptosis pathogenesis sepsis result unanswered questions- ( 1 ) whether impairment apoptosis method down-regulating pro-inflammatory cell causally result inappropriate persistence inflammation septic condition ( 2 ) whether increase apoptosis immune effector cell result immunosuppression increase susceptibility overwhelm infection ? Neutrophils first immune cell migrate site inflammation major function include phagocytosis bacteria , apoptosis neutrophil may one mechanism limit tissue injury sit inflammation phagocytosis apoptotic neutrophil inhibits release pro-inflammatory cytokine monocyte . Lower absolute neutrophil count associate increase risk hospitalization serious infection among HIV infect patient . Because neutrophil functionally impaired , hypothesize sepsis observe HIV infection might result accelerated apoptosis . This study therefore try define mechanism , direct indirect , HIV infection may dysregulate apoptosis cytokine production pathogenesis sepsis . In summary puerperal sepsis remain major cause maternal mortality South Africa . The clinical experience Durban , postpartum infection increase particularly view high prevalence HIV . Clear guideline need role antibiotic among woman risk postdelivery morbidity associate infection . Current recommendation NCCEMD SA indicate woman AIDS woman caesarean section treat prophylactically antibiotic . However , guideline regard time antibitiotic prophylaxis remain unclear6 . This study therefore set establish reliable data incidence postdelivery morbidity include puerperal sepsis , associate risk factor , laboratory marker effective antibiotic regimen reduce risk postdelivery morbidity . AIM To evaluate role intrapartum prophylactic antibiotic HIV infect woman reduce incidence postdelivery morbidity assess clinical immunological marker . HYPOTHESIS Antibiotics administer labour reduce postdelivery morbidity HIV infect woman STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary : To reduce incidence post-delivery infection use prophylactic antibiotic . Secondary : To investigate immunological parameter marker post-delivery infection . To identify risk factor post-delivery infection . PRIMARY ENDPOINTS The primary efficacy endpoint study incidence post-delivery infectious morbidity diagnose delivery 6 week post-delivery . STUDY DESIGN This prospective double blind , randomise placebo-controlled trial prophylactic antibiotic delivery . STUDY POPULATION The study conduct King Edward VIII Hospital , Durban Umtata Hospital , Transkei 2 year period . Women counsel tested HIV antenatal period , agree know result , enrolled antenatal period . Informed write consent participation study obtain voluntary participant . Immunological study conduct subsample ( 25 % ) patient study group . Inclusion Criteria - Women know HIV status document routine rapid HIV test , follow pre-test voluntary counselling testing ( VCT ) . - Women give inform study consent . Exclusion Criteria - Women antibiotic therapy le 2 week prior study enrolment . - Women plan elective caesarean delivery . - Obstetric complication preterm prelabour rupture membrane , cardiac disease , antepartum haemorrhage . Randomisation occur admission labour ward . The following test perform prior randomisation i.e enrolment : full blood count ( FBC ) , CD4 count ano-genital swabs microbiology . The woman randomly assign one three group , depend HIV status : Group 1 : HIV-POSITIVE give antibiotic ( Cefoxitin 2g IVI stat dose ) Group 2 : HIV-POSITIVE give placebo Group 3 : HIV-NEGATIVE ( placebo cefoxitin = control group ) Rationale placebo choice antibiotic : The current standard practice give prophylactic antibiotic delivery woman without risk factor irrespective HIV status . This justify placebo-controlled design . In unit current standard practice administer intravenous cefoxitin ( 2g stat dose ) woman prophylactic antibiotic indicate . We therefore intend use cefoxitin study . Sample Size : Considering 15 % puerperal sepsis rate among HIV positive woman follow vaginal emergency caesarean section delivery sample size 343 require group ( placebo study group ) observe 33 % reduction sepsis rate . This would detect significant difference 5 % level ( p &lt; 0.05 ) power 90 % . Therefore appropriate sample size : Group 1 ( HIV-positive , antibiotic ) : 343 Group 2 ( HIV-positive , placebo ) : 343 Group 3 ( HIV-negative , 686 ) INVESTIGATION PLAN Study procedure visit Visit 1 ( baseline enrolment ) take place antenatal clinic respective site . This occur mother received post-test counselling . At baseline mother inform study , verbally write , sign inform consent form . Demographic data , maternal medical history HIV relate symptom sign document HIV disease stag carry , pap smear CD 4 count do enrolment . A physical obstetrical examination do mother randomise one 3 group depend HIV status antibiotic regimen give . Visit 2 ( labour/delivery ) A diagnosis labour make clinically . Women HIV confirm labour randomised either antibiotic placebo group . A single dose mefoxin similarly look placebo administer . All woman HIV infection give single dose nevirapine ( newborns receive 0.6ml nevirapine 24-72 hour post-birth ) . During labour artificial rupture membrane delay ; invasive monitoring , use instrument delivery episiotomy avoid possible . Women also advise benefit risk exclusive breastfeed formula feeding informed choice appropriate feeding method . Blood take following : apoptosis neutrophil , neutrophil function , FBC , C-reactive protein . Serum sample also store determination cytokine level . A cervical vaginal swab also do , microbilogical evaluation . Urine analyse mean dipstix , microscopy culture reserve symptomatic patient significant finding dipstix . CD4 count do private pathologist . The reason mother enrol day night thus need 24-hour service CD4 count FBC . Visit 3 ( 24-48 hour post delivery ) An infection symptom review physical examination do . In addition blood sample take evaluation apoptosis , neutrophil function test , FBC C-reactive protein . Serum store cytokine assay . A wound swab do indicate . Visit 4 This take place 1-week post delivery . A physical obstetrical examination carry . A wound swab also do . An infant evaluation include laboratory parameter also carry visit . Visit 5 This take place 2 week post-delivery . A physical examination infection symptom review carried visit . A wound swab also do , indicate . Visit 6 This take place 6 week post-delivery . A physical infection symptom review do . Blood sample take CD4 count FBC . When necessary , pap smear wound swab also do stage . Adherence protocol Mothers encourage make every attempt complete protocol specify , reimburse transport . Dropouts Withdrawals Patients right withdraw study time may withdraw fail comply study requirement investigator instruction . OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome measure puerperal sepsis define temperature 38C two separate occasion due genital tract infection endometritis .
