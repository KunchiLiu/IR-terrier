	<brief_summary>Nearly half Americans die cardiovascular disease cause build atherosclerotic plaque within coronary artery . Most deaths patient arise development acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) myocardial infarction , unstable angina , sudden death . ACS characterize coronary plaque erosion rupture , trigger endothelial change , include inflammation , thrombosis . Diabetes , insulin resistance major component , show engender adverse metabolic event within endothelial cell [ 1 ] , include impaired endothelial function , augment vasoconstriction , increase inflammation thrombosis . Activation transcription factor nuclear factor KB ( NF-KB ) activator protein 1 ( AP-1 ) induce inflammatory gene expression , liberation leukocyte-attracting chemokines , increase production inflammatory cytokine , augment expression cellular adhesion molecule . These metabolic process may therefore play significant role development ACS.The hypothesis rosiglitazone metformin , combination may provide positive anti-atherogenic effect , even among patient without diabetes . This pilot study propose evaluate effect placebo vs. combine rosiglitazone/metformin ( Avandamet® ) surrogate blood marker atherosclerosis activity among non-diabetic pre-diabetic patient know stable coronary syndrome . This provide evidence justify large definitive outcomes-based clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rosiglitazone Metformin : Outcomes Trial Nondiabetic Patients With Stable Coronary Syndromes ( Romance ) Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , randomize , double-blind trial comparing combine rosiglitazone/metformin ( Avandametä ) placebo subject normal intermediate fasting glucose ( IFG ) stable coronary artery disease.Subjects meet entry criterion randomize 1:1 ratio receive either placebo combine rosiglitazone/metformin ( Avandametä ) 4/1000 mg . Laboratory specimens include high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) , glucose , HgbA1C , complete lipid profile , obtain 10 hour fast specify study visit . Subjects return repeat study visit 2 , 4 , 6 8 month repeat laboratory evaluation , include safety lab consist serum creatinine , liver enzymes , CBC . Additionally , subject IL-6 TNF-a measure research purpose baseline subsequent follow-up visit . All subject follow minimum 8 month . This pilot study propose evaluate effect placebo , combine rosiglitazone/metformin onsurrogate blood marker atherosclerosis activity among non-diabetic pre-diabetic patient know stable coronary syndrome .</detailed_description>
