	<brief_title>Noninvasive Positive Pressure Ventilation ALI/ARDS : Multicentre Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) increasingly use care patient suffer acute respiratory failure . High-level evidence support use NPPV treat exacerbation chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . More recently , NIV show reduce need intubation select group patient severe cardiogenic pulmonary edema , immunosuppression , respiratory failure lung resection . In subgroup analysis five randomize control trial , however , patient acute lung injury ( ALI ) ARDS still â€™ avoid intubation death even treat NPPV . Till , randomize control study NPPV patient ALI ARDS . We hypothesize patient ALI/ARDS , early use NPPV , provide appropriate inspire oxygen concentration , would prevent intubation primary end-point variable , hence avert poor outcome associate need invasive ventilation . Accordingly , conduct prospective , randomize control trial ass efficacy NPPV compare standard regime consist high-concentration oxygen therapy .</detailed_description>
