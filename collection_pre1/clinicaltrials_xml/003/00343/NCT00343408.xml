	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : AZD2171 may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor block enzyme need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving AZD2171 together standard combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose AZD2171 give together standard combination chemotherapy treat patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AZD2171 Standard Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine recommend phase II dose AZD2171 administer standard combination chemotherapy patient advance non-small cell lung cancer colorectal cancer . - Determine safety , tolerability , toxicity profile , dose-limiting toxicity , pharmacokinetic profile treatment regimen . - Assess antitumor activity treatment regimen patient measurable disease . - Correlate toxicity profile pharmacokinetics . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study AZD2171 . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group accord disease . - Group 1 ( non-small cell lung cancer ) : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 1 8 cisplatin IV day 1 . Patients also receive oral AZD2171 daily begin day 2 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Group 2 ( colorectal cancer ) : Patients receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 2 . Patients also receive oral AZD2171 daily begin day 3 . Treatment repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . In group , cohort 3-6 patient receive escalate dos AZD2171 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede least 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
