	<brief_title>A Phase II Study ACZONE™ ( Dapsone ) Gel , 5 % As Treatment For Tarceva® ( Erlotinib ) Related Rash</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , parallel design study subject treat Tarceva non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) subsequently develop rash suspect related Tarceva . Only subject glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase ( G6PD ) deficient , locally advanced metastatic NSCLC fail least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen indicate Tarceva treatment include . Subjects screen consent study within 3 day initiate Tarceva therapy instruct contact Investigator immediately sign symptom rash appear face . Subjects enrol study rash develop face confirm evaluated eligibility criterion study . Once enrol , subject randomly assign apply either ACZONE placebo rash-affected area face . Subjects apply ACZONE / placebo treatment 8 week , even symptom rash resolve completely . Specific efficacy assessment include lesion count , plaque area , erythema assessment , pruritus assessment . Rash characteristic monitor use National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Event ( CTCAE ) version 3.0 term severity description percentage facial surface area ( FSA ) affect . Investigators evaluate subject 's overall response treatment accord standardized multiple choice question . Throughout study , photographs face take . Safety follow 10 week ( 8 week therapy + 2 week follow-up ) monitor adverse event , concomitant medication , chemistry hematology parameter . Plasma dapsone N-acetyl dapsone concentration measure determine systemic exposure study treatment . Steady state plasma concentration erlotinib also measure initiate study treatment determine potential effect ACZONE pharmacokinetics Tarceva .</detailed_description>
