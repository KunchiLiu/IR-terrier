	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine take Asacol day effective take Asacol twice three time day keep ulcerative colitis inactive , determine dose regimen easy follow . Once daily dose Asacol experimental , approve FDA . Dosing three time daily FDA approve . This research do researcher want learn best method keep ulcerative colitis inactive , way take Asacol helpful subject continue take medication control ulcerative colitis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Once Daily Versus Conventional Dosing Asacol Maintenance Quiescent Ulcerative Colitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Asacol take day equally effective ( non-inferior ) conventional ( twice three time day ) dose maintain remission quiescent ulcerative colitis . Specific Aims : 1 . To assess efficacy daily Asacol short long-term maintenance remission quiescent ulcerative colitis . 2 . To assess medication consumption rate ( adherence ) patient prescribe daily Asacol compare bid tid regimen . Background : Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) idiopathic , chronic inflammatory disease large intestine characterize episode relapse remission . Relapses often predictable , although factor smoke cessation , chronic non-steroidal antiinflammatory use psychological stress think cause symptom exacerbation individual . Multiple study demonstrate efficacy aminosalicylates induce maintain remission UC . Because chronic nature , therapy often must continue indefinite basis . Many patient openly admit take medication prescribe ; medication-taking probably make patient uncomfortably aware chronic illness status , fear long-term side effect medication , question need medication set quiescent disease . Previous work do University Chicago demonstrate use objective pharmacy data , rather patient-derived information , prevalence medication non-adherence 60 % patient quiescent UC . The average amount medication consume 70 % prescribed . In prospective study , patient non-adherent medication high risk relapse consume great 75 % prescribed regimen . It difficult get patient take medication feel well , rationale continue use remain unclear . The long-term goal improve adherence reduce frequency relapse , low incidence long-term complication ( i.e . colon cancer ) , low overall health cost . Making regimen easy patient key factor increase adherence . Hussain recently show normal subject , median peak concentration , trough concentration area curve similar Asacol consume either three time daily dose regimen . Twenty-four hour urinary fecal excretion , total recovery , rectal tissue concentration also similar group . The author conclude steady-state pharmacokinetics delayed-release Asacol similar whether drug administer three divide dos throughout day single daily dose . There data suggest motility function colon patient quiescent ulcerative colitis similar normal subject . If indeed case , pharmacokinetics Asacol mimic healthy control . In small pilot study , able show 6-month time , patient likely experience flare disease actually consume medication daily regimen standard regimen . The aim study test hypothesis large number patient , assess efficacy daily Asacol patient quiescent ulcerative colitis compare twice three time daily regimen . In addition , wish compare rate medication consumption group prolong period time . Methods : Patients eligible ask sign inform consent prior participation . As part consent process , phone number patient pharmacy collect . Patients randomize one two group : daily usual ( twice daily three time daily ) therapy . Assignment via use opaque seal envelope , contain assignment base randomization table . Once enrolled , patient assign study number , use questionnaire maintain confidentiality . The patient instructed conceal regimen research investigator . Patients follow prospectively assessed 3 month interval enrollment . The three nine-month follow via phone contact one study nurse . Disease assessment quality life obtain nurse standard fashion . At time interval 6 12 month , patient assess schedule clinic visit , use assessment tool along physical exam . These visit additional extra visit , part standard care ulcerative colitis . There additional blood draw endoscopy part protocol , lab work endoscopy patient care determine treat physician document . Medication consumption rate month 3 , 6 , 9 12 calculate use pharmacy data obtain telephone PI validate formula describe Steiner colleague . The end point study disease relapse 12-month study period . An investigator blind treatment regimen assess outcome medication consumption rate group . Patients experience flare study period treat deemed necessary treating physician .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient age 18 follow University Chicago Outpatient Gastroenterology Clinic eligible . Patients must documentation ulcerative colitis standard criterion , remission least 4 month prior study entry . Remission study define clinically , absence following : blood stool , urgency , cramp . Patients must take regimen Asacol ( Asacol , Procter Gamble , Cincinnati Ohio ) maintenance quiescent disease Exclusion criterion include documented disease activity past four month , hospitalization steroid use disease activity previous 4 month , use immunomodulators induce remission . Patients history diarrheal illness diarrheapredominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome , C difficile colitis , use know diarrheal drug also exclude .</criteria>
