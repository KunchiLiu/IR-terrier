	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish objective response rate ( complete response + partial response ) , follow treatment Alimta plus VELCADE , Alimta alone , VELCADE alone patient locally advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) fail prior preventative therapy Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC . The Alimta alone treatment group use control . The VELCADE single-agent treatment group use determine VELCADE administer weekly demonstrate response rate .</brief_summary>
