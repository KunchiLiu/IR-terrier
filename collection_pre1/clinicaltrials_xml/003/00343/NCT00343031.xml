	<brief_summary>Experimental study document p ' p-DDT , p ' p-DDE ( metabolite DDT ) organochlorine ( OC ) compound estrogenic and/or antiandrogenic activity capable alter normal endocrine function . It postulate exposure toxin embriogenesis may cause urogenital malformation . However , hypothesis yet evaluate human population relatively high level exposure . The primary goal project study utero exposure DDE relation anogenital distance human . Anogenital distance measure gender specie specific landmark genitalia , junction penis scrotum male human , center anus . Altered anogenital distance sensitive manifestation prenatal endocrine disruption animal model ; whether sensitive endpoint human study . We test hypothesis DDE , androgen-receptor blocker , decrease anogenital distance male human chronically occupationally expose DDT Mexico . Study participant newborns mother live state Chiapas , Mexico expose DDT house spray program control malaria area . Anogenital distance measure birth utero exposure DDE determine measure DDE maternal blood . Demonstration p ' p-DDT p ' p-DDE may interfere normal endocrine function embriogenesis provide model increase understand other- prevalent-environmental estrogen may act open new possibility research potential control etiologic factor relate important public health problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Antiandrogen DDE Anthropometric Measures Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose follow woman child enrol original study ( n= approximately 850 ) . In original study , woman enrol interviewed hospital delivery , blood drawn , anthropometric measurement perform newborn male infant . The follow-up do primarily determine number month mother breast feed child . Secondary endpoint infant infection report mother , child growth determine measurement height weight relate measure ( none genital region , original study ) . Breast feeding duration , infection , growth may relate exposure DDT metabolite , DDE . The follow-up visit every three month 6 18 month birth , study nurse visit subject home . For subject , would fewer follow-up visit , due study schedule breastfeed cessation . Mothers would interview mother child undergo standard anthropometric assessment . This protocol call collection biologic specimens pose minimal risk subject .</detailed_description>
