	<brief_summary>This study determine high dose experimental vaccine call AMA1-C1 safely give adult expose malaria . Malaria affect 300 million 500 million people worldwide year , cause 2 million 3 million death , mostly among child 5 year age sub-Saharan Africa . It lead cause death illness among general population Mali West Africa . Increasing drug resistance malaria parasite , well widespread resistance mosquito ( insect transmit parasite ) pesticides reduce ability control malaria strategy . A vaccine could reduce illness death malaria would valuable new resource fight disease . AMA1-C1 experimental vaccine develop NIAID . Early test AMA1-C1 30 healthy people United States find serious harmful side effect vaccine . This study look effect AMA1-C1 people Mali expose malaria . Residents Don gu bougou , Mali , 18 45 year age general good health may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , urine pregnancy test woman . Participants randomly assign receive three injection ( shot ) either experimental malaria vaccine hepatitis B vaccine approve used Mali . All shot give upper arm muscle . After first shot , second give 1 month later , third give 12 month first . Subjects receive AMA1-C1 get one three different dos - low , medium , high - find dose safe give best antibody response vaccine . After shot , participant remain clinic 30 minute observation . They return clinic 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 day shot physical examination check side effect . Blood sample draw shot select return clinic visit check side effect measure effect vaccine . During rainy season second third vaccination , subject come clinic month examination blood test . During dry season , subject come clinic 3 month last shot give examination blood test . Additional blood test may do participant develop malaria . If find safe adult , study vaccine do child expose malaria , child bear brunt disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Experimental Vaccine Malaria Adults Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase 1 clinical trial evaluate safety immunogenicity Plasmodium falciparum malaria vaccine AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel , healthy malaria-exposed adult volunteer . Between 2-3 million death occur year result malaria . Most deaths result P. falciparum malaria , child five year age , sub-Saharan Africa . A safe effective vaccine would reduce morbidity mortality secondary P. falciparum would valuable resource fight disease . The apical membrane antigen 1 ( AMA1 ) surface protein express asexual blood stage P. falciparum think play role parasite invasion erythrocyte . Clinical symptom malaria human due asexual blood stage . Therefore , vaccine design protect individual illness due asexual stage P. falciparum infection inhibit parasite invasion erythrocyte . The AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel vaccine preparation study contain equal mixture AMA1 two different clone Plasmodium falciparum ( FVO 3D7 ) , produce separately recombinant protein express Pichia pastoris ( AMA1 FVO AMA1 3D7 ) . This vaccine test one clinical trial 30 malaria-unexposed human adult United States clinically significant risk identify . The study conduct Don gu bougou , Mali , blind , randomize control trial evaluate three dose level AMA1-C1 ( 5 micro g , 20 micro g , 80 micro g ) . Fifty-four healthy male non-pregnant female volunteer age 18 45 enrol . Eighteen volunteer assign three dose group . Within group , twelve volunteer randomize receive either 5 micro g , 20 micro g , 80 micro g dose AMA1-Cl/Alhydrogel 6 randomize receive tetanus toxoid vaccine . Immunizations administer intramuscular injection month 0 , 1 , 12 . The group stagger adequate safety evaluation perform prior dose escalation . The duration study 18 month per volunteer . The primary objective trial determine frequency severity vaccine-related adverse event dose . The secondary objective determine dose generate high serum antibody level AMA1 antigen Day 42 .</detailed_description>

Participant spouse unwilling use reliable contraception method one month follow third immunization ( female ) . Currently lactate breastfeed ( female ) . Evidence clinically significant neurologic , cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic , rheumatologic , autoimmune , chronic infectious renal disease history , physical examination , and/or laboratory study include urinalysis . Behavioral , cognitive , psychiatric disease opinion investigator affect ability volunteer understand cooperate study protocol . Laboratory evidence liver disease ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] great 1.25 time upper limit normal test laboratory ) . Laboratory evidence renal disease ( serum creatinine great upper limit normal test laboratory , trace protein blood urine dipstick test ) . Laboratory evidence hematologic disease ( absolute leukocyte count le 3000/mm ( 3 ) great 13.5 x 10 ( 3 ) /mm ( 3 ) ; hemoglobin less 0.9 time low limit normal test laboratory , sex ; absolute lymphocyte count le 1000/mm ( 3 ) ; platelet count less 120,000/mm ( 3 ) ) . Other condition opinion investigator would jeopardize safety right volunteer participate trial would render subject unable comply protocol . Participation another investigational vaccine drug trial within 30 day start study , study ongoing . Volunteer medical , occupational , family problem result alcohol illicit drug use past 12 month . History severe allergic reaction anaphylaxis . Severe asthma ( emergency room visit hospitalization within last 6 month ) . Positive ELISA HCV . Positive HBsAg ELISA . Known immunodeficiency syndrome . Use corticosteroid ( exclude topical nasal ) immunosuppressive drug within 30 day start study study ongoing . Receipt live vaccine within past 4 week kill vaccine within past 2 week prior entry study . History surgical splenectomy . Receipt blood product within past 6 month . Previous receipt investigational malaria vaccine . History know allergy nickel . Previous receipt primary series Hepatitis B vaccine . History know allergy yeast .</criteria>
