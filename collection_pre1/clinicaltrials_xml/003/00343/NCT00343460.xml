	<brief_title>APF530 Aloxi ( Palonosetron Hydrochloride ) Combined With Dexamethasone Preventing Nausea Vomiting Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare overall activity effect APF530 versus palonosetron hydrochloride combination dexamethasone prophylaxis acute- delayed-onset , chemotherapy-induced nausea vomit patient undergo moderately highly emetogenic chemotherapy cancer . Secondary - Evaluate safety , tolerability , efficacy APF530 , term prevention acute- delayed-onset nausea vomiting , patient . - Gather pharmacokinetics APF530 subset patient chemotherapy course 1 . - Gather ECG data ( use 24-hour Holter monitoring ) subset patient chemotherapy course 1 . OUTLINE : This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel-group , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord emetogenicity schedule chemotherapy ( moderate-risk [ level 3 4 ] vs high-risk [ level 5 ] ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm ( I , II , III ) . Patients randomize receive palonosetron hydrochloride chemotherapy course 1 ( arm I ) re-randomized 1 2 treatment arm ( II III ) chemotherapy course 1 receive treatment chemotherapy course 2-4 . Patients receive palonosetron hydrochloride APF530 and/or placebo 30-60 minute start chemotherapy . Patients receive dexamethasone 30-90 minute start chemotherapy . - Arm I : Patients receive palonosetron hydrochloride IV , placebo subcutaneously ( SC ) , dexamethasone IV day 1 chemotherapy course 1 . Patients high-risk ( level 5 ) stratum also receive oral dexamethasone day 2-4 treatment course . - Arm II : Patients receive APF530 SC , placebo IV , dexamethasone IV day 1 chemotherapy course 1 . Patients receive APF530 SC dexamethasone IV day 1 chemotherapy course 2-4 . Patients high-risk ( level 5 ) stratum also receive oral dexamethasone arm I . - Arm III : Patients receive APF530 SC high dose , placebo IV , dexamethasone IV day 1 chemotherapy course 1 . Patients receive APF530 SC ( high dose ) dexamethasone IV day 1 chemotherapy course 2-4 . Patients high-risk ( level 5 ) stratum also receive oral dexamethasone arm I . A subset patient undergo blood collection periodically study analysis plasma APF530 concentration . Quality life assess day 5 completion chemotherapy course 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow approximately 30 day .</detailed_description>
