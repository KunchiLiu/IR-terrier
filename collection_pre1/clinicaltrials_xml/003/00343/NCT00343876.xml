	<brief_summary>Inflammation associate worsen outcome among individual CAD ; C-reactive protein well-known marker inflammation . Both healthy patient history CAD exhibit elevate CRP great risk cardiovascular event . Despite CRP 's well- document association increase risk development progression CAD , specific mechanism elevate CRP CAD know . One possible etiology include continuous prothrombotic process associate CAD . Several study demonstrate link platelet activation inflammation . If thrombotic process involve mechanism elevate CRP , antiplatelet therapy , include clopidogrel , could effectively reduce CRP . Preliminary study demonstrate reduction CRP aspirin clear association clopidogrel therapy reduce CRP , however randomize trial perform . We hypothesize proinflammatory effect platelet activation may inhibit combined clopidogrel aspirin therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective trial ass effect combine therapy clopidogrel aspirin versus placebo aspirin CRP patient know CAD . Potential subject already stable aspirin statin therapy randomize clopidogrel vs. placebo I : 1 design . Participants undergo study therapy 3 month . Various laboratory parameter , include serum plasma concentration CRP , assess throughout study . The primary endpoint effect study therapy CRP .</detailed_description>
