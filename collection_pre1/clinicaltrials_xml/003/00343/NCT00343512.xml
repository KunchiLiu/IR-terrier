	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Dose-dense scheduling ( peg ) filgrastim support may improve clinical pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) safety profile single agent neoadjuvant docetaxel therapy . PURPOSE : To evaluate whether dose-dense scheduling ( peg ) filgrastim support may improve clinical pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) safety profile single agent neoadjuvant docetaxel therapy . To determine change molecular marker occur single agent docetaxel , tissue obtain end four cycle docetaxel ( either repeat biopsy definitive surgery ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) dose dense docetaxel neoadjuvant setting . Secondary - Safety toxic effect regimen patient . - Tumor response rate ( measure ultrasound ) patient treat regimen . - Determine whether early change marker cell cycle position , proliferation , apoptosis correlate pathologic complete response rate patient . - Determine whether molecular profile predicts chemoresponsiveness also predict response radiotherapy ( measured local recurrence ) patient . - Determine whether tumor demonstrate great degree change protein expression pattern pre- post-docetaxel treatment also sensitive chemotherapy ( measure pathologic response rate ) patient . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , open-label , pilot study . - Tissue Collection : Patients undergo tumor core biopsy ( 6-8 core ) blood collection prior initiate neoadjuvant docetaxel . - Neoadjuvant docetaxel hematopoietic support : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Patients also receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 2 course OR filgrastim ( G-CSF ) sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) SC daily begin day 2-4 course continue blood count recover . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . - Surgery : Within 4-6 week completion neoadjuvant docetaxel , patient undergo definitive surgery . Patients undergo tumor biopsy blood collection periodically pharmacokinetic , genetic , molecular biomarker correlative study . Samples examine change p21 protein expression ( and/or p21 phosphorylation ) protein expression profile . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 6 month 3 year annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
