	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy Treating Patients Receiving Trastuzumab For HER2-Positive Stage IIIB-IV Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To estimate RFS patient HER2 positive locally advanced breast cancer vaccinate HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . To assess safety HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine administer concurrently trastuzumab . 2 . To determine immunogenicity HER2 ICD peptide base vaccine give within one year initiate standard treatment include trastuzumab . 1 . To determine incidence development T cell immunity specific HER2 ICD . 2 . To determine incidence development intramolecular epitope spread . 3 . To determine magnitude HER2 ICD specific CD4+ CD8+ immune response generate immunization . 3 . To assess whether association RFS development immune response ( HER2 specific T cell immunity and/or development intramolecular epitope spread ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive HER-2/neu intracellular domain peptide-based vaccine mixed GM-CSF intradermally ( ID ) monthly 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 month annually thereafter 5 year .</detailed_description>
