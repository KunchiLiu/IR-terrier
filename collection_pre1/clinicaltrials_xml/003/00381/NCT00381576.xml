	<brief_summary>The purpose present investigation determine whether MS patient tolerate benefit heavy progressive resistance training . A second purpose determine neural muscle morphological adaptation heavy progressive resistance training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multiple Sclerosis Heavy Progressive Resistance Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient characterize reduced muscle strength functional capacity . For MS patient , improvement muscle strength thereby functional capacity , would potential make daily live easy extend time live independently . Attempts improve muscle strength function include application physical training , although general advice MS patient many year avoid participation physical training . It demonstrate endurance train low moderate intensity well tolerated MS patient , induces modest improvement muscle strength functional capacity . Heavy progressive resistance training ( HPRT ) proven effective mean improve muscle strength functional capacity daily activity healthy old people . However , effect HPRT investigate randomise control trial MS patient .</detailed_description>
