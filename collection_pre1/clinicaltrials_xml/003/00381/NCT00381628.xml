	<brief_title>Nasal Epithelial Cells/Blood Lymphocyte Markers Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) /CF Pulmonary Exacerbations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) common lethal genetic disease US afflict approximately 30,000 people . Chronic disease respiratory tract , responsible early death , affect upper low airway . We propose utilize cell ( blood lymphocytes nasal epithelial cell ) readily accessible know express cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator ( CFTR ) therefore candidate express marker downstream consequence CFTR deficiency . A marker indicate inflammatory state lung would useful identify infective/inflammatory exacerbation oppose worsen due pulmonary vascular disease simply upper airway infection . This marker might help guide therapy intensity duration . Evidence mouse suggest lymphocyte may drive force inflammation CF lung , particularly exacerbation , also human CF lymphocytes dysfunctional production cytokine . Specific Aims : To identify marker nasal epithelial cell blood lymphocytes distinguish CF patient functional CFTR ( healthy volunteer patient asthma ) . If successful could become marker CFTR correction drug systemic therapy . To identify marker blood lymphocyte identify inflammatory status ( ie , distinguish active exacerbation return clinical stability ) CF patient . This could become marker infectious exacerbation CF airway disease .</detailed_description>
