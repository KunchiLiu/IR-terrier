	<detailed_description>Bending straighten knee cause patella glide along groove femur bone . However , biomechanical imbalance cause patella jump track , lead pain . Interventions alter load distribution across patellofemoral joint , patella taping , may helpful alleviate symptom . Patellar tap fact show effective short-term treat patellofemoral osteoarthritis . But widely adopt clinical setting complicate administer , difficult educate patient ongoing application , lack evidence long-term efficacy . Also , patient often experience skin irritation tap discomfort remove tap . An alternative treatment option use knee brace realign track patella . This study determine whether wear patellofemoral realign knee brace effective relieving pain improve function adult knee osteoarthritis . Participation study last 3 9 month . All eligible participant wear knee brace 2-week run-in period record wear brace pain medication use . Next , participant randomly assign wear one two knee brace 6 week minimum 4 hour day . This follow 6 week wear knee brace , 6 week wear whichever knee brace wear first 6-week period . There total nine study visit . The first study visit screen eligible participant include interview , knee evaluation , x-ray , urine pregnancy test . The second sixth study visit include knee evaluation , brace fitting , instruction correctly wear adjust brace . Most study visit consist primarily interview functional test . During first third 6-week period , participant maintain log record long wear brace pain medication use . Participants also wear accelerometer , keep track many step take .
