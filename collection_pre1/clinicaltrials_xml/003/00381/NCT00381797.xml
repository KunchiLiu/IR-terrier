	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together irinotecan work treat young patient recurrent , progressive , refractory glioma , medulloblastoma , ependymoma , low grade glioma . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth glioma block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together irinotecan may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate rate objective response observe prior disease progression first four course treatment bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride pediatric patient recurrent , progressive , refractory malignant glioma ( Stratum A [ close accrual 4/21/2009 ] ) recurrent/progressive/refractory intrinsic brain stem glioma ( Stratum B [ close accrual 4/21/2009 ] ) . II . Estimate rate objective response observe prior disease progression first four course treatment bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride patient recurrent progressive medulloblastoma ( Stratum C [ close accrual 10/27/2009 ] ) recurrent progressive ependymoma ( Stratum D [ close accrual 7/29/2010 ] ) . III . Estimate sustain disease stabilization rate associate bevacizumab irinotecan patient recurrent progressive low grade glioma ( Stratum E [ close accrual 7/29/2010 ] ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate rate treatment-related toxicity regimen patient . II . Estimate cumulative incidence sustain objective response function regimen patient . III . Estimate distribution survival event-free survival patient . IV . Correlate functional change tumor progression-free survival response use MR perfusion/diffusion image fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord tumor type ( high-grade glioma [ close accrual 4/21/2009 ] v intrinsic brain stem tumor [ close accrual 4/21/2009 ] v medulloblastoma [ close accrual 10/27/2010 ] v ependymoma [ close accrual 7/29/2010 ] v low grade glioma [ close accrual 7/29/2010 ] ) . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 16 17 course 1 . Patients receive bevacizumab irinotecan hydrochloride day 1 15 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 4 week 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo MRIs brain , magnetic resonance perfusion/diffusion , fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography baseline periodically treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
