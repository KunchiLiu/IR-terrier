	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Thyroid Cancer That Did Not Respond Iodine I 131 Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine response rate single agent sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) patient iodine refractory , unresectable well-differentiated thyroid cancer ( WDTC ) evidence disease progression within 6 month study enrollment . II . Determine response rate single agent sunitinib patient medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) evidence disease progression within 6 month study enrollment . III . Determine toxicity , duration response , progression free survival , overall survival patient WDTC MTC treat single agent sunitinib . IV . Determine whether presence ret proto-oncogene ( RET ) gene rearrangement patient WDTC RET mutation patient MTC predict response sunitinib . V. Determine whether therapy sunitinib affect phosphorylation downstream RET effector , mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( ERK ) , WDTC MTC tissue . VI . Determine whether specific germ-line polymorphism RET gene associate favorable outcome patient WDTC treat sunitinib . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 cohort accord type thyroid cancer ( medullary v well-differentiated ) . Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year .</detailed_description>
