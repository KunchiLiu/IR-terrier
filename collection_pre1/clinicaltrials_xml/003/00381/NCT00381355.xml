	<brief_title>RCT Written Action Plan vs. Usual Care Children With Acute Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective propose large , high-intensity , randomise control trial evaluate real-life effectiveness provide write action plan asthmatic child discharge emergency department ( ED ) hospital short-term adherence write recommendation ( include medication , attendance asthma education medical follow-up ) . Contrary traditional definition write action plan,1 i.e. , set write instruction follow case exacerbation , propose test new write action plan base innovative concept emphasise key element associate good asthma care : ( 1 ) use preventive medication , ( 2 ) need asthma education , ( 3 ) need regular medical review , ( 4 ) environmental control ( 5 ) instruction use rescue medication . The main outcome adherence prescribe inhaled preventive medication measure electronic counter . Secondary outcome include attendance asthma education medical follow-up , serve pharmacy prescription oral steroid , well asthma control measure questionnaire ( Asthma Quiz Kidz ) ,2 use rescue ß2-agonists , relapse emergency room . Because recommended medical follow-up primary care physician may recommend change preventive treatment initiated hospital , short-term outcome occur within 28 day index visit consider associate use write action plan . We purposely design trial test additional benefit intervention usual care , recognize heterogeneity amount asthma information provide within time constraint emergency room 90 physician . To provide clinically meaningful generalisable information , eligibility criterion study entry limit bare necessity confirm diagnosis asthma . The randomisation stratify age reflect target interlocutor write action plan , namely parent 60 % child age &lt; 6 year , child parent pair 40 % child age 7 12 year old , adolescents 10 % patient age 13-17 year old . We anticipate important variation characteristic enrol patient reflect real heterogeneity emergency department attendee , namely severity baseline exacerbation ( 55 % mild , 35 % moderate , 10 % severe ) , ownership write action plan ( 15 % ) , prior asthma education ( 30 % ) , use daily preventive medicine ( 25 % ) , etc , may influence adherence rate write action plan . To compensate heterogeneity patient ' characteristic provide instruction , power trial identify clinically important difference main outcome set 90 % rather traditional 80 % . The strength propose study clearly assessment real-life effectiveness provide new concept write action plan high-risk population improve main obstacle good asthma control , namely adherence preventive medication attendance asthma education regular review .</detailed_description>
