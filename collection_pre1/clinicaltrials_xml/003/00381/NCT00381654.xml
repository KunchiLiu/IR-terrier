	<brief_title>Safety/Tolerability Study AV-412 Subjects With Refractory Relapsed Solid Tumor Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although progress make , patient malignancy often either progress traditional approach chemotherapy , surgery , radiotherapy , candidate approach advance stage disease . Novel therapy may offer great potential currently available urgently need . AV 412 potent inhibitor human epidermal growth factor family receptor tyrosine kinase ( TKIs ) represent grow class anti-cancer agent . The recent introduction TKIs open door new approach cancer treatment goal therapy halt disease progression , ameliorate symptom , improve patient quality life . AV412 may inhibit growth solid tumor , few less debilitating side effect . This study design determine safety , tolerability maximum tolerate dose daily oral administration AV 412 . Patients assign escalate drug dose cohort determine optimal dose . Evaluations determine tolerability include PK , PD , adverse event occur course study drug administration .</detailed_description>
