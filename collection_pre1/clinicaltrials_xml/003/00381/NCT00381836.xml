	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Aranesp® ( Darbepoetin Alfa ) , administer every fourth week , effective treatment blood shortage ( anemia ) compare standard care treatment ( blood transfusion ) patient anemia due hormone refractory prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Darbepoetin Alfa ( Aranesp® ) Anemia Patients With Advanced Hormone Independent Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past , prostate cancer regard relatively benign disease , elderly men expect die rather , however , prostate cancer become second common non-skin cancer Danish men second common cause male cancer death . Two three patient clinically significant prostate cancer die cancer disease , misery population evident . Regular treatment opiates equivalent drug well require nearly one third patient . Patients advance hormone insensitive ( refractory ) prostate cancer median survival rate one year time often suffer anemia due reason like blood loss , tumor infiltration bone marrow even treatment androgen deprivation . Compared patient cancer type patient prostate cancer significantly low mean haemoglobin level . However , patient hormone refractory prostate cancer previously give much attention treatment frequent condition chronic anemia group patient seem casual . Therefore , Best Standard Care ( BSC ) define RBC transfusion hemoglobin &lt; 5,0 mmol/L ( 8,0 g/dl ) , sign symptom anemia supplemental iron se-ferritin &lt; 200 mcg/L . Very little known erythropoietin treatment quality life hormone refractory prostate cancer patient . A randomized Swedish study investigate influence two different dos epoetin beta quality life , hemoglobin level , need red blood cell transfusion safety , treatment anemia 180 patient suffer advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer . This study find treatment safe effective treatment many patient . In many critically ill patient , treatment improve quality life relieve fatigue symptom . Darbepoetin alpha ( Aranesp® ) produce gene-technology Chinese Hamster Cells ( CHO-K1 ) . It biological effect toxicity profile comparable r-HuEPO ; exception longer half-life mean administer less frequently without loose clinical efficiency . Aranesp® well tolerate study conduct date . In set Aranesp® appear safe well tolerate . Adverse event report date generally mild moderate severity consistent event symptom cancer patient chronic disease receive chemotherapy ( i.e . fatigue gastrointestinal symptom ) . Clinical study show high frequency thromboembolic reaction include deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism cancer patient receive Aranesp therapy compare patient receive placebo . The clinical experience far Aranesp® publish ( 15,16,17 ) . Aranesp® register clinical use Europe US . Based present study evaluate effect Aranesp® haematopoietic response patient advance hormone independent prostate cancer anemia . Moreover , effect Aranesp® quality life , hemoglobin , necessity RBC transfusion hospital admission , evaluate . The study perform open randomize trial . The use r-HuEPO cancer patient establish registered setting ( supportive treatment ) , show preparation give without significant side effect . On contrary , likely patient may benefit additional improvement wellbeing .</detailed_description>
