	<criteria>A subject must least 12 year age , either sex , race , diagnosis asthma least 12 month duration consistent follow definition : The diagnosis asthma base upon clinical history examination , pulmonary function parameter , response beta2agonists , accord international guideline . A subject must use high dose inhale glucocorticosteroid ( ICS ) either alone combination longacting beta2 agonist ( LABA ) least 12 week prior Screening , use oral glucocorticosteroids within 30 day prior Screening . A subject must stable asthma regimen ( daily dose unchanged ) least 2 week prior Screening . High daily dos ICS define follow : &gt; 1000 mcg beclomethasone chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) &gt; 500 mcg beclomethasone hydrofluoroalkane ( HFA ) &gt; 1000 mcg budesonide dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) &gt; 2000 mcg flunisolide &gt; 500 mcg fluticasone &gt; 400 mcg MF &gt; 2000 mcg triamcinolone acetonide &gt; 320 mcg ciclesonide Note : Dose delivery method modality note must equivalent . A subject must experience least one severe exacerbation require course oral glucocorticosteroid 2 12 month prior Screening . If , base upon medical judgment investigator , inherent harm change subject 's current asthma therapy , subject ( parent/guardian , applicable ) must willing discontinue his/her prescribed ICS ICS/LABA prior initiate MF MDI runin medication . To document diagnosis asthma assure subject 's responsiveness bronchodilator randomization , one follow method use Screening Visit , Day14 , thereafter , prior Baseline Visit : The subject must demonstrate increase absolute FEV1 least 12 % least 200 mL within approximately 15 20 minute administration four inhalation albuterol/salbutamol ( total dose 360 400 mcg ) . The subject must demonstrate peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) variability 20 % express percent best low morning prebronchodilator PEF least 1 week . The subject must demonstrate diurnal variation PEF 20 % base difference prebronchodilator ( take albuterol/salbutamol ) morning value postbronchodilator value ( take albuterol/salbutamol ) evening , express percentage mean daily PEF value . Note : If subject qualify use diurnal variation , subject instruct perform his/her PEF evaluation use his/her bronchodilator evening . At Screening Visit , subject 's FEV1 must &gt; =50 % predict restricted medication withhold appropriate interval . At Baseline Visit , subject 's FEV1 must &gt; =50 % &lt; =85 % predict restricted medication withhold appropriate interval . The subject ( parent/guardian subject age legal consent ) must willing give write informed consent able adhere dose visit schedule . A female subject childbearing potential must use medically acceptable , adequate form birth control . This include : hormonal contraceptive prescribe physician ( oral combine , hormonal vaginal ring , hormonal implant depotinjectable ) ; medically prescribe intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; medically prescribe topicallyapplied transdermal contraceptive patch ; condom combination spermicide ( doublebarrier method ) ; monogamous relationship male partner vasectomy . The subject must start birth control method least 3 month prior Screening ( exception condom combination spermicide ) , must agree continue use duration study . A female subject childbearing potential currently sexually active must agree consent use medically acceptable method become sexually active course study . Women surgically sterilize least 1 year postmenopausal consider childbearing potential . A female subject childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test Screening order consider eligible openlabel MF MDI Runin Period . A subject demonstrate change ( increase decrease ) absolute FEV1 &gt; 20 % time Screening Visit include Baseline Visit . Pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) perform morning . A subject require use &gt; 8 inhalation per day shortacting beta agonist ( SABA ) MDI &gt; =2 nebulized treatment per day 2.5 mg SABA , 2 consecutive day Screening Visit include Baseline Visit . A subject experience decrease AM PM peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) Runin Period stability limit 2 consecutive day prior randomization . A subject experience clinical asthma exacerbation ( define deterioration asthma result emergency treatment , hospitalization due asthma , treatment additional , exclude asthma medication [ include oral systemic corticosteroid , allow SABAs ] ) , time Screening Visit include Baseline Visit . A subject treat emergency room ( severe asthma exacerbation ) , admit hospital management airway obstruction , within last 3 month . A subject ever require ventilator support respiratory failure secondary asthma . A subject experience upper low respiratory tract infection ( viral bacterial ) within previous 2 week prior Screening Baseline Visits . Visits reschedule 2 week complete resolution event reassess eligibility . A subject smoker exsmoker smoke within previous year cumulative smoking history &gt; 10 packyears . A subject clinically significant abnormal vital sign . A subject evidence ( upon visual inspection , laboratory culture require ) clinically significant oropharyngeal candidiasis Baseline ( Visit 3 ) without treatment . If evidence oropharyngeal candidiasis Screening PreBaseline Visit , subject may treat appropriate Baseline Visit schedule upon resolution . If evidence oropharyngeal candidiasis Baseline Visit , subject may treat appropriate visit reschedule upon resolution . A subject history clinically significant renal , hepatic , cardiovascular , metabolic , neurologic , hematologic , ophthalmologic , respiratory , gastrointestinal , cerebrovascular , significant medical illness disorder , judgment investigator , could interfere study , require treatment might interfere study . Specific example include ( limited ) insulindependent diabetes , hypertension treat beta blocker , active hepatitis , coronary artery disease , arrhythmia , stroke , severe rheumatoid arthritis , chronic openangle glaucoma posterior subcapsular cataract , acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , condition may interfere respiratory function clinically diagnose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , chronic bronchitis , emphysema , bronchiectasis , cystic fibrosis , etc . Other condition wellcontrolled stable ( eg , hypertension require beta blocker ) prohibit participation deem appropriate per investigator 's judgment . A subject know allergic intolerant ICS , beta2 agonist , excipients present medication use study . A female subject breastfeeding , pregnant , intend become pregnant participate study . A subject know illicit drug user . A subject know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positive ( HIV test conduct study ) . A subject unable correctly use oral MDI inhaler . A subject take restricted medication prior Screening without meeting require washout timeframes . A subject adhere permit concomitant medication prohibit medication . A subject participating study may participate study another investigational site . In addition , subject participate different investigational study site , timeframe study . A subject must randomize study . No person directly associate administration study may participate study subject . No family member investigational study staff may participate study . A subject previously participate trial MF/F . Subjects history significant QTC prolongation ( ie , QTc &gt; 500 msec ) exclude participation study .</criteria>
