To evaluate whether PCP D-d assessment , together use low molecular weight heparin ( LMWHs ) , allow objective appraisal PE defer 72 hour , plan prospectively evaluate consecutive patient suspect PE . Methods . In case deferment diagnostic imaging PE , patient identify high-risk ( high PCP moderate PCP positive D-d ) , receive protective full-dose treatment LMWH ; remain patient discharge without anticoagulant .

	<detailed_description>Introduction Pulmonary Embolism ( PE ) , serious complication Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) , relatively common potentially fatal disease . Its diagnosis usually require multiple approach base diagnostic imaging ventilation/perfusion lung scanning ( V/Q ) Computed Tomography ( CT ) . However , performance image immediately perform case night week-end referral ; situation , attend physician decide whether treat incompletely assess patient hospitalise confirmatory test carry . In lack guideline , empirical protective anticoagulation Low Molecular Weight Heparins ( LMWH ) , drug show favourable pharmacodynamic profile comparison UnFractionated Heparins ( UFH ) , usually give patient . However , clear-cut information available need anticoagulation , dosage duration , time deferral diagnostic procedure consider safe . It seem appropriate safer , though , management base preliminary evaluation actual risk thrombosis . We recently demonstrate patient clinically suspect venous thromboembolism , Pre-test Clinical Probability ( PCP ) , D-dimer use LMWH safely use delay diagnostic test 72 hour ( Siragusa S et al . Arch Intern Med 2004 ; 164:2477 ) . Our paper mainly focus patient suspected Deep Vein Thrombosis ( 80 % patient ’ cohort ) consider category lower risk complication PE patient . Critically , data lack guide management patient clinically suspect PE undergo immediate diagnostic imaging . We plan perform prospective clinical trial aim evaluate whether data derive PCP D-dimer testing , together use LMWHs , permit safe management patient suspect PE objective assessment available . Materials Methods Patient Population Out-patients presenting suspect acute PE , diagnostic image immediately available ( night week-ends ) , consider eligible study . The study conduct three Institutions ( University Hospital AOUP “ Paolo Giaccone ” Palermo , IRCCS Policlinico S. Matteo , Italy IRCCS Ospedale Maggiore di Milano , Italy ) protocol . Exclusion criterion include follow : 1 ) life-threatening condition , serious co-morbidities require immediate hospitalisation ; 2 ) relapse previously document PE episode ; 3 ) current use oral anticoagulant therapy ; 4 ) history bleed contraindication heparin ; 5 ) age young 18 year ; 6 ) life expectancy le 3 month ; 7 ) refusal give inform consent . Algorithm intervention Patients evaluate manage accord clinical assessment protocol . PCP PE assess first ( use previously report clinical model , follow D-dimer test . Patients consider “ low-risk ” , case low PCP moderate PCP negative D-dimer test result , discharge without anticoagulant therapy . Conversely , patient moderate PCP positive D-dimer test high PCP , consider “ high risk ” receive therapeutic dos LMWHs ‘ protective anticoagulation ’ . Physicians indeed option admit patient hospital irrespective PCP D-dimer test result . All patient , either manage out-patients , havo undergo diagnostic imaging within 72 hour PCP D-dimer test assessment . Diagnostic assessment protocol PE Diagnosis PE assess describe ; briefly , patient undergo Ventilation-perfusion ( V/Q ) lung scan lung CT within 72 hour patient referral . In case diagnostic imaging , patient undergo ultrasonography low limb . Patients weill diagnose PE high-probability V/Q scan abnormal image result show venous thrombus . All diagnostic test perform operator unaware D-d assay result PCP assessment . In case positive diagnostic image test result , patient manage accordingly receive full dose anticoagulant . Blood draw D-dimer assay mixed tri-sodium citrate ( 1 vol ) test technician unaware test result . We use semi-quantitative latex assay ( Dimertest® , Dade Behring , Deerfield Ill ) perform describe . Follow-Up Patients monitor 2 period follow-up : short-term long-term . Short-term follow-up defined time patient referral completion diagnostic procedure ( within 72 hour ) . Patients train return contact physician period case : 1 ) worsen respiratory symptom ; 2 ) sign symptom suggestive develop deep venous thrombosis leg ; 3 ) major minor bleed protective anticoagulation ; 4 ) reason hospitalisation due VTE-related symptom . Long-term follow-up ( 3 month ) use record incidence PE patient diagnosis rule . At follow time , case sign symptom suggestive aforementioned event , patient undergo objective assessment imaging . Statistic analysis We estimate primary event rate ( PE major bleed ) short-term follow-up would less 2 % . We plan include sufficient number patient ensure upper limit 95 % Confidence Intervals ( CI ) less 2.5 % . This result projected sample size least 300 patient . The rate occurrence thromboembolic event short- long-term follow-up determine 95 % CI calculate . The proportion patient develop VTE PCP group relative 95 % CI determine , proportion patient develope event long-term follow . Paired “ ” Pearson 2 test use indicate ; P &lt; .05 % ( 2-tailed ) consider statistically significant . Diagnostic accuracy D-dimer assessment calculate term sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value correspond 95 % CIs ( 9 ) .</detailed_description>
