	<brief_title>University Michigan `` Nephrology Research BioBank ''</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each year chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) claim live million people worldwide . Costs patient care excess 2.4 billion dollar US alone . At moment kidney diseases unknown etiology , classify accord microscopic description kidney tissue obtain biopsy treat non-specific therapy . Each kidney contain million filter unit call nephron . The nephron consist glomerulus tubule . The glomerulus filter blood waste product , retain large molecule require body function properly . The filtered fluid pass tubule , salt , acid water regulate keep body normal metabolic state . After filtered fluid pass tubule collect bladder urine . Diseases , affect glomerulus tubule result kidney damage . Once kidney function lose generally recoverable option patient 's survival dialysis transplantation . The purpose study provide platform , enable researcher different area expertise , investigate molecular marker pathways kidney disease progression . Our goal increase understand kidney health issue develop new prevention treatment strategy share medical community public . Study description : Individuals see nephrology clinic University Michigan eligible enroll study . Their clinical data record , blood urine sample collect biopsy perform part standard medical care small sample reserve use study pathological evaluation require patient care complete . Biological sample available biochemical , molecular biological genetic test correlation parameter individual clinical data future study . Significance : Advances understand kidney disease may 1 ) provide method early detection disease , 2 ) identify molecular marker help physician prescribe appropriate beneficial treatment , 3 ) identify target development new treatment , 4 ) decrease enormous cost caring individual CKD . Aim : 1 . Create biobank enable study kidney disease perspectives epidemiology , genetics molecular biology . 2 . Create resource study kidney disease , enable researcher University Michigan work collaboratively toward elucidation molecular pathway , cause kidney disease .</detailed_description>
