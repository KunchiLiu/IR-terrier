	<brief_summary>Hypersalivation ( Too much saliva ) drool side effect experience 31 % people take antipsychotic clozapine . This study aim determine use medication ipratropium bromide ( IPB ) bedtime reduce amount salivation distress people may feel .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Clozapine-Induced Hypersalivation Ipratropium Bromide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With recent question regard effectiveness newer atypical antipsychotic medication treat schizophrenia , clozapine continue remain gold standard treatment-refractory schizophrenia . However , treatment clozapine continue limited many side effect . The second common side effect , occur 31 % clozapine treat patient , hypersalivation sialorrhea . Sialorrhea profoundly stigmatize functionally disable certain patient , may increase discontinuation rate high-risk patient population . Several study evaluate efficacy anticholinergic agent mainly small , uncontrolled study anecdotal report often complicate difficulty medication administration systemic side effect . Open label case series study demonstrate promising result ipratropium bromide ( IPB ) treatment clozapine-induced hypersalivation , act anticholinergic receptor minimal systemic absorption . However , randomize control trial evaluate IPB treatment problematic side effect.The primary goal study determine efficacy ipratropium bromide reduce clozapine-induced hypersalivation , per Toronto Nocturnal Hypersalivation Scale , modify hypersalivation scale incorporate Drooling Severity Scale Nocturnal Hypersalivation Rating Scale , reduce measurement visual analogue scale hypersalivation distress severity . Our hypothesis Ipratropium bromide use bedtime result significant reduction nocturnal clozapine-induced hypersalivation measure Toronto Nocturnal Hypersalivation Scale ( TNHS ) local anticholinergic activity .</detailed_description>
