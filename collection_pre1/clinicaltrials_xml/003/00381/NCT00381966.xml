	<detailed_description>Section 1- Background : Adenocarcinoma prostate affect 220,900 U.S. male year , make prevalent cancer nation.1 Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) useful tumor marker early detection malignancy , well reliable marker control definitive therapy either surgery irradiation.2,3,4 Widespread use prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) screening result approximately 45 % patient detect early stage disease . For group patient , brachytherapy implantation radioactive source prostate treatment option rise dramatically use last several year due effectiveness convenience.5 The use brachytherapy implantation radioactive source prostate adenocarcinoma advantage external beam radiation high dose deliver tumor limit dos surround normal tissue ( i.e. , bowel bladder ) . It well establish outcome treatment brachytherapy critically related technical quality source placement within gland . A spatially desirable placement radioactive source achievement optimum dose distribution within prostate key success brachytherapy regard kill tumor well minimize toxicity.6,7,8 The development transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) prostate , ability map prostate several plane , well associate development trans-perineal implantation prostate , allow development modern prostate implantation method . Ultrasound image take implant procedure , source distribution plan develop optimizes dose prostatic tissue spar urethra rectum . Needles place prostate via transperineal template , source place prostate accord source distribution plan . Currently , template utilized needle guidance limit 0.5 centimeter x-axis y-axis grid spacing , limit ability needle position conform shape prostate , spherical ( Fig 1 ) . The commonly utilized method dosimetric plan involves place needle around periphery prostate capsule , order best cover potential microscopic extracapsular extension well avoid dose sensitive urethra run center.9 The grid arrangement current template limit ability needle position best approximate external contour prostate ( Fig 2 ) . Also , placement source posterior row adjacent rectum critical . Sources close rectum may cause increase risk rectal bleeding , whereas source far capsule may result risk underdosing disease area.10,11 Greater freedom needle positioning would allow optimum placement source . Figure 1 . Transperineal template device 3 Figure 2 . Grid position available traditional template ( white dot grid screen ) . Prostate outline see image . Researchers JHU School Engineering develop robotic needle positioning device allow great flexibility choose needle position prostate brachytherapy . The device consist motor attach needle guidance hole . The entire apparatus attache ultrasound 'stepper ' device similar standard transperineal template . For needle position , motor move predetermine location physician place needle hole . Visual verification acceptable needle position perform view needle real-time ultrasound . A secondary mean verification use Optical Tracking device , verify needle orientation position prior insertion . Rather probe position desire endpoint needle insertion within prostate , ultrasound unit mechanically couple needle ( via optical track system ) insert , needle tip continuously visualize progress prostate . Another problem frequently encounter brachytherapy pubic arch interference . Given proximity prostate pubic arch , anterior aspect prostate often abut structure . If pubic arch curve posteriorly around inferior aspect prostate , access anterior prostate transperineal needle limit . Some patient may eligible brachytherapy due problem anatomy.12 This device allow angulation needle pubic arch interference may circumvent insert posteriorly angle needle anteriorly pubic arch needle path travel toward anterior prostate . We use CMS Interplant system software ( St Louis , MO ) , capability calculate treatment plan use source usual template grid position . Section 2 -Objectives : This feasibility trial therapeutic device . The purpose study demonstrate clinical feasibility use needle positioner device cohort 5 patient . This involve demonstrate feasibility use system actual operating room environment determine acceptable position effectiveness assess needle position insertion live ultrasound image , well use optical tracking device . Section 3- Study Population : The eligible population patient diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate see consultation Johns Hopkins Hospital . We currently perform 1-2 brachytherapy procedure per week average ; therefore patient accrual ( 5 patient ) expect complete within 3-5 month . Section 4 - Protocol Design : This feasibility study cohort 5 patient . 4.1 . Subject Identification : Patient confidentiality maintain accordance Health Information Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) guideline . All participant must sign informed consent describe objective study potential risk . All patient data report case report form identify patient 's initial study code number . Patients shall identify name . This serve protect confidentiality subject enrol trial . Clinical data record subject study include history physical finding , laboratory data , result intervention maintain investigator secure , lock location . Computerized data require password authorization ( ) access . 4.2 . Description Recruitment Process : Potential subject identify time consultation Department Radiation Oncology Dr. Song . All patient meeting state eligibility criterion offer participation study consult physician . 4.3 . Description Informed Consent Process : Only physicians investigator project perform inform consent interview . The informed consent interview take place prior day patient treat ensure patient adequate time discuss research project family , friend , and/or Health Care provider . During informed consent interview interviewer ( investigator ) take much time need ensure potential subject understands research project also clearly understands participate project receive cancer treatment Johns Hopkins . If patient decides enroll research project sign three copy inform consent form . One record , one keep Clinical Research Office Johns Hopkins , third one keep medical record . 4.4 . Subject Assignment : Five patient enrol onto trial . 4.5 . PATIENT ASSESSMENTS Assessments Pre-Study Entry Post Brachytherapy Month 3 ( +/- 4 week ) History/physical Exam Xa X KPS Xa PSA Xa X Chest X-ray Xa Xb CT pelvis Xa Xb Ultrasound volume Xa Bone scan ( clinically indicate ) Xa 1. within 6 week prior day 1 brachytherapy 2. 1 day post brachytherapy RADIATION THERAPY AND RESEARCH INTERVENTIONS The patient population offer protocol currently offer brachytherapy standard treatment institution . The clinical protocol affect patient experience procedure . Implant procedure As routine , within week prior implantation patient undergo transrectal ultrasound study determine volume prostate estimate number source require . A preliminary implant plan develop base pre-operative ultrasound . On day implantation , patient bring operating room 'timeout ' perform . He place dorsal lithotomy position anesthetic ( either general spinal ) administer . A foley catheter place urethra . Ultrasound image acquire dosimetric plan develop base intraoperative ultrasound . Computerized dosimetric algorithm use assist physician create plan adequately treats prostate minimize dose urethra rectum . Given needle positioner device allow infinite number position rather limit predetermined hole , source placement plan physician mind . Sources place immediate feedback software dosimetric ramification normal tissue prostate coverage . If source position correspond usual template grid , software allow user 'drag ' close grid needle position desire location . Instead standard template pre-drilled hole mount ultrasound support mechanism , needle positioner device attach stepper unit . Needles insert needle positioner , perineum prostate , use position dictate dosimetric plan . Ultrasound guidance use visualize guide needle placement . An optical tracking system ( Northern Digital Inc , Waterloo Canada ) measure accuracy 0.1 millimeter , use track needle position angle prior insertion tissue . The correctness needle position produce NPD ascertain two level , commit needle insertion insertion . The tracker place field surgery . The tracker calibrate coordinate space template . Then template remove NPD place . The tracker calibrate coordinate space NPD . Assuming tracker move procedure , establishes direct spatial co-registration coordinate space template NPD . At time procedure , current position NPD needle guide report responsible physician template coordinate . Thus physician compare current needle position ( reported template space ) desire needle position determine treatment plan ( also template space ) . In case discrepancy report desired needle position , NPD remove replaced template , procedure continue without delay . During needle insertion , ultrasound move synch needle insertion ( via optical track motorize control ultrasound probe ) order allow constant visualization needle tip insertion . The depth insertion ultrasound probe limit stepper unit attach . After needle insertion , C-arm fluoroscopy briefly use assess confirm positioning , Mick applicator ( Mick Radio-Nuclear Instruments , Mount Vernon NY ) use place source prostate via needle . Following source placement needle remove , needle positioner move next needle position , procedure repeat source place . After source place , final set fluoroscopic image take confirmation documentation . When use standard transperineal template , template calibrate ultrasound probe prior implant procedure use phantom , grid template accurately correlate grid see ultrasound . However , actual procedure uncommon needle position visualize ultrasound slightly displace predict location . This due needle bending tissue force insertion . When occur physician remove needle repeat insertion mild force needle point tissue entry order achieve desire position . The needle guide may also recalibrated successive needle attempt show consistent deviation one direction , indicative slight error calibration . This unusual finding typical practice . For purpose study , needle position system also calibrate prior implant . However , procedure physician find needle positioner inaccurate non- systematic fashion ( related slight calibration error ) relative intend position , system quickly replace standard template procedure , since mount stepper identical fashion . Other treatment Patients either Gleason score 7 PSA 10-20 treat external beam radiation addition brachytherapy accordance usual practice .</detailed_description>
