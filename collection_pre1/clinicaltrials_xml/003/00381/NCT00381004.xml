	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn use combination fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) help control previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . The safety combination also study . This study evaluate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) relationship response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>FCR Plus Sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) Frontline Therapy Symptomatic Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fludarabine cyclophosphamide design enter CLL cell destroy `` machinery '' allow CLL cell multiply . Rituximab design bind CLL cell cause cell death . GM-CSF design help bone marrow produce white cell . It may also increase target molecule call cluster differentiation antigen 20 ( CD20 ) rituximab surface CLL cell may improve activity rituximab . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete physical exam . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . The routine blood draw include test hepatitis B , unless do within last 6 month . This routine blood draw also include pregnancy test woman able child . To eligible take part study , pregnancy test must negative . A bone marrow aspirate biopsy collect . To collect bone marrow aspirate biopsy , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . If find eligible take part study , receive GM-CSF thorough needle skin Day 1 . Each study cycle 4 week , may longer depend side effect leukemia response . You receive rituximab needle vein Day 2 . The first infusion may take 8 hour . For every dose rituximab , infusion may take 2-4 hour . The length infusion time depend whether reaction infusion . The dose level rituximab may increase Cycles 2-6 well . The drug Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) Benadryl ( diphenhydramine hydrochloride ) give dose rituximab . This do decrease risk side effect . If side effect occur rituximab treatment , drug may stop side effect go away restart , time outpatient area may longer occurs . On Days 3-5 first treatment cycle , fludarabine cyclophosphamide give needle vein . Each infusion take 30 minute . After first treatment cycle , fludarabine cyclophosphamide give Days 2 , 3 , 4 every cycle . During cycle , day receive fludarabine cyclophosphamide , begin receive GM-CSF . You receive drug 1 week white cell count return acceptable level . Cycle 1 give M.D . Anderson 's outpatient clinic . In case , Cycle 1 may give inpatient area . The 5 cycle give either M.D . Anderson another location . With exception rituximab , dose drug use throughout study unless side effect become severe . In case , dose may lower , treatment may stop . During cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn every 1-2 week routine test . You bone marrow biopsy perform end Cycles 3 6 check status disease . You may remain study 6 cycle . You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Once study , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw every 6-12 month routine test . This investigational study . Fludarabine , cyclophosphamide , rituximab , GM-CSF FDA approve commercially available . However , use study combination consider investigational . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol M.D . Anderson .</detailed_description>
