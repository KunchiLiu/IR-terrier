	<brief_title>Vitamin D Dose-Response Study Establish Dietary Requirements Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vitamin D status currently judge serum 25 ( OH ) D parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) -25 ( OH ) D dynamic ( 1 ) . The ultimate effect vitamin D human health healthy skeleton , characterized infancy normal linear growth bone mineral accretion absence bone related disease , rickets ( 1 ) . The importance indicator illustrate epidemiological research , linear growth infancy positively related peak bone mass adult ( 2 ) . Moreover , vitamin D status ( 3 ) intake ( 4 ) infancy relate bone mass child . In 2004 , Health Canada reaffirm population health policy breastfed , healthy term infant Canada receive daily vitamin D3 supplement 400 IU ( 5 ) . This policy recommendation make consultation Canadian Expert Advisory Committee Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRI ) . They determine 1997 DRI value vitamin D 200 IU low Canadians base Canadian study ( 6 , 7 ) surveillance system ( 1 ) indicate high rate vitamin D deficiency vitamin D deficient rickets continue Canada . Both Health Canada committee ( 5 ) Institute Medicine Committee Dietary Recommended Intakes ( 1 ) acknowledge considerable uncertainty regard defines optimal vitamin D intake infancy base functional outcome . In adult , minimum serum 25 ( OH ) D value 75 nmol/L defines optimal vitamin D status ( 8 ) . This concentration derive dose-response study relationship 25 ( OH ) D PTH , PTH plateaus approximately mid-normal range also study 25 ( OH ) D concentration 90 100 nmol/L positively related bone mineral density ( BMD ) young adult ( 9 ) . A dose-response study determine physiological functional response vitamin D3 supplementation conduct infant necessary confidently set DRI value Canadian infant . In summary , health care professional face major gap knowledge : ) constitute optimal vitamin D status infancy base physiological functional outcome , 25 ( OH ) D , PTH bone mass ; b ) oral dosage vitamin D supplement require elevate serum 25 ( OH ) D optimal value key biomarker optimal vitamin D status . The global objective study conduct dose-response study vitamin D3 intakes provide information regard physiological functional response vitamin D supplementation infancy , include : 25 ( OH ) D concentration relationship 25 ( OH ) D , PTH bone mineral accretion . Once best dosage determine , fund large study span Canadian region seek conclusively demonstrate dosage appropriate Canadian infant . In large study , infant follow longitudinally confirm optimization vitamin D status infancy enhance peak bone mass . 2.0 BACKGROUND 2.1 Recommendations Intakes Vitamin D Infants The AI value least 200 IU/d derive amount breast milk typically consume infant concentration vitamin D breast milk result serum 25 ( OH ) D concentration 27.5 nmol/L ( 1 ) . The current recommendation vitamin D intake Canada infant list , dosage evaluate use dose-response study conduct Canada . - 400 IU vitamin D3/d infant recommend 2004 Health Canada , The Canadian Pediatric Society Dietitians Canada Guidelines Healthy Term Infants ( 5 ) ; - entirely breast-fed infant give 400 IU vitamin D daily may increase 800 IU/d October April recommend Indian Inuit Committee Canadian Pediatric Society ( 10 ) . Infants bottle-fed formula make fortified whole can milk receive additional 400 IU October April ( 10 ) . 2.2 Vitamin D Metabolism Sources Vitamin D Infants : The Canadian Scenario Endogenously synthesize vitamin D form cholecalciferol ( vitamin D3 ) . Most food source supplement Canada mammalian form , contain plant form , ergocalciferol ( vitamin D2 ) . Vitamin D3 estimate approximately 9.5 time potent vitamin D2 ( 12 ) . Endogenous synthesis account majority vitamin D adult ( 8 ) . Above latitude 42 northern hemisphere , synthesis limit late spring mid-autumn , low intensity UVB radiation , rest year . The majority Canadians reside north 42nd parallel , place risk hypovitaminosis D year round use sunscreen environmental factor , clothing pollution , reduce exposure UVB sunlight ( 14 ) . This mean endogenous synthesis pregnant woman subsequent maternal-fetal transfer may compromise . Fortified food milk , margarine vitamin supplement remain major source vitamin D many Canadian adult . 2.2.1 Maternal-fetal transfer birth : Given fact Canadian woman consume enough milk ( 15 , 16 ) , surprise 1/3 infant bear already deficient vitamin D. In Manitoba , PI document 36 % infant white non-white parent deficient vitamin D birth , define serum 25 ( OH ) D 27.5 nmol/L , 46 % mother value &lt; 37.5 nmol/L ( 6 ) . In study , 20 % white infant deficient , group 60 % First Nations , Asian , Filipino Black infant deficient . This suggest vitamin D deficiency uncommon , particularly non-white woman infant ( 6 , 19-22 ) . Likewise season birth ( 19 ) ethnicity ( 6 ) important factor consider define much vitamin D require achieve maintain target value 25 ( OH ) D infant . 2.2.2 Infants birth 12 month : Infants limit store vitamin D birth amount transfer mother short half life 10-21 day ( 1 ) . For infant exclusively breastfed , vitamin D supplementation recommend Health Canada ( 5 ) vitamin D concentration low breast milk Canadian mother ( 4-40 IU/L ) . Fortified formula would provide ~ 400 IU vitamin D/L daily , likely achieve close 6 month age ( i.e. , intake 1L/d ) . After 6 month age , food available infant limit vitamin D content . 2.3 Role Early Life Vitamin D Human Bone Health Term infants 25 ( OH ) D concentration 27.5 nmol/L high weight adjust bone mass bear low concentration ( 6 ) . The effect high maternal-fetal transfer vitamin D sustain long childhood , illustrate recent report Southampton , UK ( 50N latitude ) : maternal vitamin D status pregnancy , synonymous fetal exposure vitamin D utero , positively correlate bone mass child measure late 9 year age ( 3 ) . The effect various dosage vitamin D whole body/skeletal bone mineral accretion first year life report . In first year life , expect whole body bone mineral content ( BMC ) almost triple parallel growth ( 24 , 25 ) . In formula fed infant , whole body BMC 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month age 79 , 130 , 160 , 200 235 g respectively measure dual energy x-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) precision error 4.5 % ( 25 ) . Since large increment 1 3 month ( 63 % ) , ideal time compare outcome respect effect various dosage vitamin D bone mineral accretion . However , yet conduct important objective present proposal . It anticipate optimal vitamin D status yield great bone mass , since Geneva , Switzerland ( 46N latitude ) , even 400 IU/d vitamin D3 supplement infancy ( median duration 12 month ) associate high BMD 7 9 year age ( 4 ) . In girl receive vitamin D supplement infancy , BMD 6 % high distal radius 9 % high femoral neck , even adjustment size ( 4 ) . These positive association must view conjunction study identify peak bone mass critical factor bone health ( 26 ) . Whether positive effect supplement translate high peak bone mass , yet know . An additional limitation study conduct Canada , unique climate , culture , food supply , policy relate infant sun exposure . Since optimal vitamin D requirement Canadian infant ill define , benefit bone mass also unclear . As , recommend dietary intake vitamin D3 Canadian infant must identify rigorous , well-controlled , randomized design optimal vitamin D status primary outcome . 2.4 New Paradigm Optimal Vitamin D Status Physiologically , blood calcium fall , PTH release promote hydroxylation 25 ( OH ) D 1,25 ( OH ) 2D . Both PTH 1,25 ( OH ) 2D mobilize calcium ( Ca ) bone enhance absorption Ca diet glomerular filtrate . Elevated PTH level characteristically see individual inadequate vitamin D status result long latency disease osteoporosis ( 27 ) . A high PTH also result low dietary Ca , infant , breast milk formula provide ample Ca . Optimal 25 ( OH ) D concentration infant unknown project least 75 nmol/L base adult study ( 8 ) . This value derive well control dose-response study vitamin D3 supplementation men woman , demonstrate reduction serum PTH ( 8 , 28 , 29 ) increase 25 ( OH ) D concentration plateau mid-normal PTH reference range . However , current thinking suggest 25 ( OH ) D-PTH dynamic instrument determine recommendation , supplement alternate biomarkers , bone mass mineral metabolism , clearly define optimal ( 27 ) . This illustrate study young adult higher vitamin D concentration ( 90-100 nmol/L ) associate high BMD compare low concentration ( 9 ) . This would suggest gain 25 ( OH ) D beyond associate PTH plateau important . Similarly , 25 ( OH ) D concentration 75 80 nmol/L child 7 18 year age relate normalization PTH ( 30-34 ) select target concentration age group well . Concentrations 25 ( OH ) D value associate enhance bone mineral accretion one cohort ( 35 ) randomize control trial ( RCT ) vitamin D supplementation 400 600 IU/d adolescent ( 36 ) . These study emphasize PTH-25 ( OH ) D dynamic bone mass important determinant establish RDA pediatrics . Such dose-response study vitamin D3 exist Canadian infant possible PTH biomarker adequacy life stage . There limited dose-response study [ 2 ] RCT [ 1 ] examine daily oral vitamin D intake infant ( 37-39 ) . The detail study recently summarize part NIH request systematic review compile Canadian expert . The key message report dose-response study vitamin D3 intake infant , vitamin D2 ( 9.5 x low potency ( 12 ) ) dosages range 100 1000 IU/d . These study short duration none conduct Canada . Additionally , study measure PTH none measure whole body bone mass . Clearly , trial vitamin D3 Canadian infant overdue . In order well understand optimize vitamin D status infant , new biomarkers bone formation resorption include comprehensively assess bone metabolism association 25 ( OH ) D , PTH whole body BMC . Suggested biomarkers include plasma osteocalcin urinary N-telopeptide . Osteocalcin increase growth bone mineralization first year life , alkaline phosphatase ( 40 ) . Osteocalcin superior marker , since also reflect seasonal change 25 ( OH ) D PTH infancy ( 41 ) . For bone resorption , urinary N-telopeptide practical marker , measure urine also specific index bone resorption . Excretion N-telopeptide spot urine sample infant first year life use confidence compare group patient ( 42 ) . 2.5 Safety Considerations , High Dosages Elevate 25 ( OH ) D No Adverse Effects There observed adverse effect vitamin D2 D3 dose 1800 IU/d infant ( 1 ) . In event hypervitaminosis D , hypercalciuria hypercalcemia could occur . Sustained hypercalcemia could manifest failure-to thrive , anorexia , irritability , nephrocalcinosis effect , remote possibility cardiac arrhythmia . In one publish study infant receive approximately 1200 IU vitamin D per day ( D2 supplement D3 formula ) ( 43 ) , pilot coordinate Dr. Taback ( Univ . Manitoba ) applicant ( see CV module , CDA grant ) infants received 2000 IU/d vitamin D3 , hypercalcemia hypercalciuria note . In late trial , PTH data yet available dose vitamin D3 result 25 ( OH ) D well 75 80 nmol/L ( 199 nmol/L , n=4 ) . While small calculate SD , study suggests require intake vitamin D3 likely 2000 IU/D . 2.6 Theoretical Calculation Vitamin D Intakes To Establish Study Dosage Groups As described 2.1 , RDA define EAR + 2 SD cover requirement 97 % population . If target 75 nmol/L infant , mean 2.5 percentile must concentration . Using data PI 's research 83 cord blood sample , mean value 25 ( OH ) D 35 SD 15 nmol/L ( full dataset Weiler et al . ( 6 ) ) . Thus low 2.5 percentile 5 nmol/L . To elevate 75 nmol/L , gain 70 nmol/L would require ( 97 % infant target ) . Unfortunately , little available data dose-response dynamic mammalian cholecalciferol ( D3 ) infant , study plant ergocalciferol ( D2 ) may mislead due difference bioavailability , may much whole order magnitude . The preliminary data Drs . Taback Weiler use daily supplement either 400 IU 2000 IU D3 small number Winnipeg infant ( n=4 group ) data u base estimate . Although small sample confidently estimate measurement variance , observe rise 44 115 nmol/L respective mean 25 ( OH ) D concentration first 3 month supplementation . Thus , 400 IU dose vitamin D3 expect achieve mean concentration 75 nmol/L 3 month age . 800 IU D3 use study currently recommend Canadian infant . Because 2000 IU D3 felt excessive base modest number infant give dose short follow , elect select 1200 1600 IU intermediate yet likely candidate RDA dose . 3.0 OBJECTIVES HYPOTHESIS HYPOTHESIS : Daily oral dosage 400 IU/d vitamin D3 inadequate achieve optimal vitamin D status 97 % Canadian infant . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : To define dosage vitamin D3 require achieve 25 ( OH ) D concentration ≥ 75 nmol/L 3 month age exclusively breast fed infant . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : When multiple dos achieve primary objective optimal 25 ( OH ) D concentration , best dosage identify base : ( ) 25 ( OH ) D-PTH dynamic ( ii ) incidence adverse event , disturbed mineral homeostasis ( e.g . hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria , etc ) , ( iii ) alternate marker bone health ( e.g . bone mass , osteocalcin N-telopeptide ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVE : We examine quantitative relationship primary secondary outcome measure various prospectively collect predictor variable , include dose , vitamin D breast milk fortify formula , gender , season birth , ethnicity , baseline vitamin D store determine select dosage maintain 25 ( OH ) D first year life . 4.0 METHODOLOGY : Dose Response Study 4.1 Population n=192 breast-fed infant great Montreal region study . The rationale study breast-fed infant current recommend optimal food infant , along vitamin D supplement , fact 85 % woman Canada initially breastfeed infant ( 44 , 45 ) . Beginning breastfeed allows confirmation best dose suitable breastfeeding dose also optimal later infancy introduction food wean vitamin D fortify formula . Initially pilot study employ 24 infant evaluate recruitment strategy , study questionnaire procedure use large study . 4.2 Study Protocol 4.2.1 Recruitment : Rolling recruitment 1 year 1-year follow begin September 2006 continue August 2007 . Equal number across month seek . At least two large pediatric clinic ( Médicentre St-Lazare Clinique de santé jeunesse ) primary recruitment centre 1500 newborn annually receive ongoing medical care . These clinic provide care family wide range SES culture representative Montreal Canada . Infants recruit first postnatal visit 2 week age . Such recruitment age suitable since breastfeeding deem establish recovery birth weight good health confirm . The clinician inform woman family meet inclusion criterion , interested participate study name contact address telephone number forward study coordinator . All study visit take place Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit , School Dietetics Human Nutrition . 4.2.2 Study treatment group : After obtain write consent infant randomize study group stratify sex ( see page 12 ) randomization process ) . At recruitment ( 2-4 week age ) , baseline measurement conduct prior provide treatment . Infants randomize receive 400 , 800 , 1200 1600 IU/d vitamin D3 1 year age . A placebo group include since standard Canada 400 IU/d precedent consider placebos unethical already set ( 37 ) . The supplement double blind investigator staff cod supplement Euro-Pharm agree provide supplement kind . This supplement stable least 3 month ( long interval measurement ) dosage deliver 2 ml volume . 4.2.3 Frequency duration follow : Baseline follow visit ( 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month life ) include anthropometric measurement blood urine analysis ( 25 ( OH ) D , PTH , calcium , phosphorus , creatinine ) well bone marker bone mass measurement . An additional blood sample obtain 1 month start study monitor blood calcium level . Bottles supplement assess compliance visit . Other source vitamin D intake review diet history well determine content vitamin D breast milk . Maternal baseline information regard demographic gather initial visit dietary vitamin D intake assess visit . 4.3 Details Measurements INFANT : NUTRITIONAL AND HORMONAL STATUS AND BONE METABOLISM 4.3.1 Sample procurement : Blood urine sample collect infant visit . All sample take 8 10 control diurnal variation permit 3 4 infant see Unit daily . Heparinized blood ( ~1 ml infant via finger poke - 400 ul safety , 600 ul measurement ) non-pharmacological approach use provide pain control include swaddle 1 ml 33 % sucrose solution give sub lingual 2 minute prior collection ( 46 ) . 4.3.2 25 ( OH ) D PTH concentration : Vitamin D status measure use RIA ( 25-50 ; Diasorin ) know measure D2 D3 plasma ( 47 ) . This method ( RIA ) select common clinical method HPLC competitive protein binding assay . Serum intact PTH measure use ELISA ( 50 ul ; Immutopics International ) . 4.3.3 Bone marker : Change bone metabolism response 25 ( OH ) D assess marker osteoblast activity relate mineralization , plasma osteocalcin ( 20 ul ; Diasorin ) . Osteoclast activity assess measure urinary N-telopeptide ( ELISA , Osteomark ) correct creatinine . The assay specific Type 1 collagen CV % &lt; 8 % . N-telopeptide measurement urine select blood reserve small blood sample measurement . Urinary N-telopeptide spot urine sample validate measurement infancy ( 42 ) . The PI experience measurement ( 6 , 48 ) . 4.3.4 Anthropometry : For infant , size birth ( weight , length , head circumference ) gestational age document vaccine carnet . Growth assess visit use triplicate measurement weight ( near g without clothing/diaper ) , crown-heel length ( near 0.1 cm use infant length board ) head circumference ( near 0.1 cm use non-stretchable tape ) . Data express absolute unit standard deviation score use data Centers Disease Control age . Quality growth achieve term age available lean fat mass provide measurement bone mass use DXA , report accurate reproducible ( 49 ) . 4.3.5 Nutrition : Milk intake infancy assess weigh infant prior breast-feeding ( i.e. , test weigh basis require weigh scale ) . For purpose , parent provide electronic weigh scale design test weigh 3 day return research site courier . Additionally , breast milk vitamin D ( form ) measure ( use HPLC ( 51 , 52 ) ) sample collect inception 3 month visit use electronic breast pump . Mothers ask feed infant one breast pump . Total intake vitamin D derive milk intake milk vitamin D concentration . Thus total intake vitamin D possible whether breast-fed fed formula . At age , dietary supplement intake document infant use write 3-day record design accommodate test weigh documentation milk food consume successfully use previously PI ( 53 ) . Estimated portion size make use household measuring tool . Mothers ask time introduction solid food fluid breast-milk vitamin D supplement . If infant wean infant formula cow milk , product brand document . It anticipate 3 4 month age many infant wean breastfeed formula . However , dosage adjust . Intake vitamin D infant formula , cow ' milk etc document used calculate total daily intake supplement . Such additional vitamin D address statistical analysis anticipate systematic variation total intake . 4.3.6 Bone mass : Measurement bone area , BMC BMD whole body , lumbar vertebra ( L2-4 ) femur visit conduct use DXA ( QDR 4500A Discovery series , Hologic Inc. ) Mary Emily Clinical Nutrition Research Unit . DXA validate measure infant whole body regional BMC ( 49 , 54 , 55 ) delivers minimal radiation ( 6 uSv ) comparison standard pediatric x-ray ( ~60 uSv ) . Since position infant difficult standardize , BMC use whole body femur . For lumbar spine , standardize position feasible enable assessment bone area , BMC BMD . Infants sedate scanned sleeping wrap receive blanket standardize clothing without metal zipper , clasp etc . Data express absolute value bone area , BMC BMD also rate change BMC . The measurement whole body bone mass ideal recommend ISCD ( 56 ) . To enable complete data regard bone , next best measurement lumbar spine , vertebra 1-4 ( 56 ) . This measurement easily attainable infant 1 year age require 30 60 second compare whole body 3 minute . In addition , femur scan 30 60 second offer novel assessment long bone . Whole body BMC correct body weight , length lean mass also express change period study . Correction weight length endorse ISCD rather novel method use bone area height ( 59 ) since normative data infant currently available . Differences whole body bone mineral accretion inception , 3 6 month 6 12 month great error measurement DXA estimate &lt; 4.5 % ( 25 , 49 ) . Values spine bone area , BMC BMD femur BMC compare among group . MATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS 4.3.7 General demographic anthropometry include : Maternal age , weight gain pregnancy , height , family income range number dependent member , employment , high education level achieve , previous pregnancy , live birth . To obtain accurate measurement height , mother measure inception visit . Weight also measure accurately describe population . Self-reported weight gain pregnancy document . Mothers ask self-identify ethnicity . These data use simply characterize study population . 4.3.8 Nutrient intake : Dietary supplement intake mother last trim pregnancy assess use validate food frequency questionnaire , modify Willett/Harvard ( 60 ) . This questionnaire modify assess intake last 3 month pregnancy . These data use describe vitamin D exposure fetus utero bone mineralizing . At visit mother lactating , intake vitamin D assess use 24-hour recall . The value maternal vitamin D intake use describe population necessary determine result extrapolate Canadian population . 4.4 Recruitment Statistical Analysis 4.4.1 Recruitment : Infants equally allocate 4 dosage group , base randomization block 8 accommodate stratify gender since growth diverges male female infant first year life . Even distribution among 4 season ( standard calendar date ) seek recruit 1/12th sample month . The fact infant may already begin vitamin D supplement consider systematic error . 4.4.2 Power sample size : The sample size 48 enable balance group across season gender . This sample size permit analysis data feed type : infant exclusively breast-fed versus wean formula necessary meet objective 3 . 4.4.3 Data Analysis : The intention-to-treat principle apply , include randomized infant outcome . For comparison purpose , result also evaluate term dose actually receive . Should baseline imbalance occur group despite randomization , treat covariates adjust . To compare proportion treatment group , sample proportion evaluate Chi-squared test proportion , adjust multiple comparison ensure family-wise error rate 0.05 . Results assess time point , Chi-squared test trend proportion compare temporal evolution . Mean 25 ( OH ) D concentration , bone mass , biochemical index bone remodel compare dose group fix effect ANOVA model , significant group difference localize suitable post-hoc testing ( e.g . Tukey method ) , adjustment multiple comparison ensure family-wise error rate 0.05 . Time course evaluate mixed effect ANOVA model ( addition time random effect ) . The dynamic 25 ( OH ) D-PTH relationship visually assess linearize log-log plot , whose slope measure PTH sensitivity 25 ( OH ) D. The best-fit line determine least square , slope compare standard method base distribution regression coefficient t-statistics . Taking follow independent predictor variable - dose , source vitamin D , age , gender , season birth , ethnicity , baseline vitamin D store - effect likelihood achieve therapeutic target evaluate multiple logistic regression , ordinary multivariate linear regression examine impact serum concentration 25 ( OH ) D , bone mass , osteocalcin , N-telopeptide .</detailed_description>
