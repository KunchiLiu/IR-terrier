	<brief_title>A Study ZYC300 Administered With Cyclophosphamide Pre-Dosing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label study ZYC300 treatment advance stage malignancy kidney patient previous immune-based therapy treatment advance stage malignancy ( cancerous growth ) ovary , breast , colon , hormone-refractory prostate patient fail least one two prior regimen chemotherapy . Patients meet entry criterion administer 600 mg/m^2 cyclophosphamide intravenously 3 day dose ZYC300 . ZYC300 administer 400 microgram DNA/total dose every two week maximum six dos ( 6 cycle ) . ZYC300 plasmid DNA formulate within biodegradable microencapsulated particle . This first time ZYC300 Cyclophosphamide give together . Cyclophosphamide chemotherapy drug approve FDA use many year many different kind cancer . In trial study drug use boost immune system . Sometimes immune system fight infect abnormal cell cell call T reg cell . The T reg cell limit immune system attack infected abnormal cell . In study , hope Cyclophosphamide inhibit T regs cell ZYC300 work well attack cancer cell .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To include study , patient must meet following criterion : 1 . Patients : Advanced stage malignancy fail treatment , include least one , two , prior regimens chemotherapy : Ovary , Breast , Colon , Hormone Refractory Prostate Cancer ( HRPC ) , renal . 2 . Evidence measurable disease clinical radiographic assessment tumor biomarker ( ovarian prostate cancer ) . 3 . Age ≥ 18 year old . 4 . A baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0 1 . 5 . A life expectancy &gt; 6 month . 6 . Adequate hematological function establish within 14 day prior receipt first dose cyclophosphamide , define : 1 . Absolute lymphocyte count ≥ 1,000/mm^2 2 . WBC ≥ 3,000/mm^2 3 . Platelet count ≥ 75,000/mm^2 4 . Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL 7 . Adequate renal function establish within 14 day prior receipt first dose cyclophosphamide , define serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X upper limit normal . 8 . Adequate hepatic function establish within 14 day prior receipt first dose cyclophosphamide , define : 1 . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X upper limit normal , 2 . SGOT SGPT ≤ 2.5X upper limit normal . 9 . An MRI brain , clinically indicate , negative parenchymal central nervous system metastasis within 28 day prior receipt first dose cyclophosphamide . If patient undergo MRI medical contraindication , contrast CT brain acceptable . 10 . A negative pregnancy test ( blood urine ) within 14 day prior first dose cyclophosphamide ( applicable ) . 11 . Agree use appropriate contraception study entry endofobservation visit . 12 . A sign informed consent form approve Institutional Review Board . Patients participate study follow apply : 1 . Have history parenchymal brain metastasis . 2 . Have receive follow within 28 day prior receive first dose cyclophosphamide : 1 . Chemotherapy 2 . Radiation therapy 3 . Immunotherapy 4 . Systemic immunosuppressive drug 5 . Glucocorticoids ( inhaler asthma permit ) 6 . Investigational agent experimental therapy 3 . Have receive three biologic/targeted therapy , monoclonal antibody tyrosine kinase inhibitor . 4 . Have initiate reinitiated use hormonal agent within 28 day prior receive first dose cyclophosphamide . These drug allow treatment initiate great 28 day prior receipt first dose cyclophosphamide . 5 . Have history bone marrow stem cell transplantation . 6 . Have history treatment fludarabine , 2chlorodeoxyadenosine , 2deoxycoformycin similar compound . 7 . Have history treatment chronic systemic immunosuppressive drug . 8 . Have immunologic disorder immunodeficiency chronic autoimmune disease deem clinically significant . 9 . Have active systemic infection require treatment . 10 . Are known positive HIV antibody . 11 . Pregnant lactating . 12 . Have history alcohol abuse , illicit drug use , psychiatric disorder would Investigator 's opinion jeopardize protocol compliance compromise patient 's ability give inform consent . 13 . Have prior ex vivo vivo DNA therapy ( administration viral vector plasmid DNA formulation ) cancer vaccine . 14 . Previous exposure ZYC300 amolimogene ( HPV E6E7 plasmid ; formerly know ZYC101a ) . Please note : There may additional inclusion/exclusion criterion . The study center determine patient meet criterion . If patient qualify trial , study personnel explain reason . If patient qualify , study personnel explain trial detail use IRBapproved informed consent , answer question . Patients decide wish participate .</criteria>
