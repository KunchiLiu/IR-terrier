	<brief_summary>This phase III trial study observation see well risk base treatment strategy work patient soft tissue sarcoma . In study , patient assign receive surgery +/- radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy depend risk recurrence . Sometimes , surgery , tumor may need additional treatment progress . In case , observation may sufficient . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , ifosfamide doxorubicin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving treatment surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Define risk-based treatment strategy comprise observation , adjuvant radiotherapy , adjuvant chemoradiotherapy neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy , surgery , adjuvant chemotherapy without radiotherapy young patient non-rhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcoma ( NRSTS ) . II . Assess event-free overall survival patient treat regimen . III . Assess pattern treatment failure patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess feasibility neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy approach patient intermediate- high-risk NRSTS . II . Assess image pathologic response neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy patient intermediate- high-risk NRSTS . III . Correlate image pathologic response clinical outcome patient intermediate- high-risk disease undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . IV . Prospectively define clinical prognostic factor associate event-free survival , overall survival , local recurrence , distant recurrence patient . V. Correlate patient outcome finding biologic study perform tissue specimen collect protocol COG-D9902 patient . VI . Determine whether diagnosis histologic grade NRSTS assign enrol institution correlate diagnosis histologic grade establish central expert pathology reviewer . VII . Compare Pediatric Oncology Group ( POG ) Fédération Nationale de Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer ( French Federation Cancer Centers [ FNCLCC ] ) pathologic grade system determine good correlate clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients divide 3 risk group accord presence metastatic disease ( yes v ) , status prior surgery ( resect vs unresected ) , grade tumor ( low vs high ) , size primary tumor ( ≤ 5 cm v &gt; 5 cm ) . Patients assign different treatment regimen base disease extent ( nonmetastatic v metastatic ) , tumor size ( ≤ 5 cm v &gt; 5 cm ) , extent resection primary tumor ( resect vs unresected ) , extent resection metastasis ( complete microscopic residual v gross residual ) , microscopic tumor margin ( negative v positive ) , tumor grade ( low vs high ) . GROUP 1 ( low risk [ nonmetastatic , grossly resected disease , except high-grade tumor &gt; 5 cm ] ) : Patients low-grade tumor either negative positive microscopic margin high-grade tumor ≤ 5 cm ( maximum diameter ) negative microscopic margin assign regimen A . Patients high-grade tumor ≤ 5 cm ( maximum diameter ) positive microscopic margin assign regimen B . REGIMEN A ( observation ) : Patients undergo observation . REGIMEN B ( adjuvant radiotherapy ) : Beginning 6-42 day surgical resection , patient undergo total 31 fraction adjuvant radiotherapy . GROUP 2 ( intermediate risk [ nonmetastatic , resect unresected disease ] ) : Patients grossly resect , high-grade tumor &gt; 5 cm ( maximum diameter ) assign regimen C. Patients unresected tumor assign regimen D. REGIMEN C ( adjuvant chemoradiotherapy ) : Patients receive ifosfamide IV 3 hour day 1-3 week 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 24 hour day 1 2 week 1 , 4 , 13 , 16 , 19 . Beginning week 4 , patient also undergo total 31 fraction radiotherapy . *NOTE : *Patients receive brachytherapy initiate radiotherapy Week 1 . If brachytherapy administer , chemotherapy begin within 2 week completion brachytherapy Weeks 1 19 doxorubicin give instead Weeks 7 10 . REGIMEN D ( neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy , surgery , adjuvant chemotherapy without radiotherapy ) : Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy surgery : Patients receive ifosfamide IV 3 hour day 1-3 week 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 24 hour day 1 2 week 1 4 . Beginning week 4 , patient also undergo total 31 fraction radiotherapy** . Patients undergo surgical resection week 13 . NOTE : **Patients primary hepatic tumor receive radiotherapy week 4 . Adjuvant chemotherapy without radiotherapy : Patients receive ifosfamide IV 3 hour day 1-3 week 16 19 doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 24 hour day 1 2 week 16 , 19*** , 22 . Beginning week 16 , patient achieve gross total resection positive microscopic margin undergo total 6 fraction adjuvant radiotherapy . Patients achieve less total gross resection undergo total 11 fraction adjuvant radiotherapy . Patients achieve total gross resection negative microscopic margin receive adjuvant radiotherapy . NOTE : ***Patients receive adjuvant radiotherapy week 16 receive doxorubicin hydrochloride week 25 instead week 19 . GROUP 3 ( high risk [ metastatic , resect , incompletely resect , unresected disease ] ) : Patients low-grade , all-sites resect tumor either negative positive microscopic margin assign receive treatment group 1 regimen A . Patients high-grade , grossly resect primary tumor , metastatic disease assign receive treatment group 2 regimen C. Patients unresected , high-grade metastatic tumor assign receive treatment group 2 regimen D. In group , treatment continue absence disease progression . After complete study treatment , patient follow periodically least 5 year .</detailed_description>
