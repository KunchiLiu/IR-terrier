	<brief_title>Promoting Tolerance Common Allergens High-Risk Children : Global Prevention Asthma Children ( GPAC ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Researchers suspect allergy common inhale allergen ( house dust mite , cat dander , grass pollen ) major cause childhood asthma . Recent evidence suggest allergy inhale allergen prevent , cause change immune system may inhibit development asthma . Although strategy prevent allergy generally focus avoid allergen , complete avoidance common allergen link asthma would require extreme measure impractical . Oral mucosal immunoprophylaxis ( OMIP ) therapy allergy treatment induce long-lasting immune tolerance people already suffer allergy . By expose patient small , repeat , increase dos problem allergen long period time , patient 's immune system eventually desensitize particular allergen . OMIP therapy show safe child young 2 year old . This study evaluate OMIP therapy common inhale allergen safe effective preventing development asthma child high risk develop disease . Children enrol study diagnose eczema food allergy family history eczema , allergic rhinitis , asthma . There two group study . The experimental arm participant receive OMIP therapy ( mixture house dust mite , cat , timothy grass allergen ) daily oral drop tongue 1 year ; Placebo arm participant receive allergen free placebo solution . Participants follow additional 3 year see whether develop allergy asthma determine OMIP affect immune system 's response allergens . There 5 study visit first year 6 visit next 3 year . At visit , participant assess allergy/asthma symptom , ask complete questionnaire , may ask provide blood saliva sample .</detailed_description>
