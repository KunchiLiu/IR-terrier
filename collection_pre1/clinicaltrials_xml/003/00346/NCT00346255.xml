	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , BB-10901 , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose BB-10901 treating patient relapse and/or refractory multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BB-10901 Treating Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine dose-limiting toxicity maximum tolerate dose BB-10901 patient relapse and/or refractory CD56-positive multiple myeloma . Secondary - To determine qualitative quantitative toxicity BB-10901 administer schedule . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics BB-10901 . - To recommend dose Phase II clinical study BB-10901 give specific regimen . - To observe evidence anti-tumor activity BB-10901 . Objectives MTD Expansion Cohort - To evaluate response rate include overall response rate ( ORR ) complete response rate ( CRR ) , duration response ( DOR ) . - To assess time progression ( TTP ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) . OUTLINE : This open-label , non-randomized , dose-escalation , multicenter study . Patients receive BB-10901 IV 1-2 hour day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos BB-10901 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Up 40 patient treated MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow short term follow-up long term ( 3 year ) survival status . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
