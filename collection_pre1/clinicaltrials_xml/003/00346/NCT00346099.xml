	<brief_summary>Panitumumab monoclonal antibody . It work attach protein call epidermal growth factor receptor find normal cancer cell . When panitumumab attache , block another protein call epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) attach cell . This important , EGF block , cell 's growth slow stop . Panitumumab may also help radiation therapy work . Also panitumumab fully-human antibody , may less toxic monoclonal antibody make block EGF receptor . Chemotherapy , capecitabine oxaliplatin , work kill cancer cell directly . Capecitabine give radiation help radiation therapy work well . This study do learn rectal cancer tumor remove surgically respond treatment panitumumab chemotherapy give radiation therapy begin follow treatment panitumumab capecitabine give radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Panitumumab Given First With Capecitabine Oxaliplatin ( CAPOX ) Then With Capecitabine Radiation Pelvis Treatment Patients With Rectal Cancers That May May Not Have Spread Beyond Rectum</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer express EGF and/or EGFR mRNA 66 % primary tumor , 44 % adjacent mucosa , 62 % positive lymph node . Patients enrol NSABP FR-1 begin therapy anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab -- show single-agent activity colorectal cancer patient -- combination CAPOX , effective treatment patient advance colorectal cancer , convenience use oral fluoropyrimidine ( capecitabine . ) The intent first phase expose distant metastasis agent early shrink tumor give radiation therapy . After chemotherapy , radiotherapy capecitabine panitumumab give destroy primary tumor . Panitumumab add radiochemotherapy regimen data show positive result another anti-EGFR antibody add radiotherapy patient head neck cancer . This approach aim improve neoadjuvant combine modality therapy rectal cancer ; provide effective therapy eligible patient valuable information clinical tumor response rate treatment tolerability , , favorable , may use develop future Phase III trial .</detailed_description>
