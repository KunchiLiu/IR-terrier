	<brief_title>Safety Study Retinal Transplantation Dry Age Related Macular Degeneration .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim clinical trial test safety transplant human fetal neural retinal tissue retinal pigment epithelium eye human patient age-related macular degeneration . Vision eye operate poor vision eye must 20/200 worse . `` Retinal tissue '' , layer back eye , consist neural retina retinal pigment epithelium . `` Neural retina '' nerve cell layer process light vision . The `` photoreceptor cell '' neural retina detect light transform electrical signal , transfer brain retinal cell . `` Retinal pigment epithelium '' ( RPE ) layer behind neural retina help nourish cell neural retina also get rid waste product . The fetal tissue use study derive dead fetus first 9-16 week pregnancy obtain elective abortion . Fetal retinal transplantation highly experimental . The research conduct accordance prohibition regard use human fetal tissue describe Public Law 103-43 , section 498B . There compensation donor . The research conduct accordance applicable Federal , State local law . First , technical application implantation instrument safety transplantation demonstrate patient 20/200 vision one eye worse , functional acuity contra lateral eye . Secondly , human fetal retinal tissue place area beneath retina presently patient atrophy retinal pigment epithelium poor retinal function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The subject must decrease central visual acuity 20/200 bad one eye ETDRS vision test duration least one year operate eye diagnosis age relate macular degeneration ; vision nonoperated eye must well operate eye . Vision operate eye well 20/200 . Subject old 55 year age Patient willing return followup visit Patient sign informed consent retinal transplantation Patient undergone microperimetry Goldmann visual field test . Patient central visual acuity well 20/200 one eye ETDRS vision worse 20/200 one eye ETDRS duration less one year Unwilling sign inform consent Patient 55 year age Patient medical problem contraindicatory shortterm anesthesia Patient unwilling return followup visit The patient determine pregnant patient history pregnancy test woman childbearing potential Features condition agerelated macular degeneration study eye ( pathologic myopia presume ocular histoplasmosis ) associate choroidal neovascularization Any significant ocular disease ( choroidal neovascularization ) compromise could compromise vision study eye confound analysis primary outcome . Inability obtain photographs document choroidal neovascularization , include difficulty venous access History choroidal neovascularization study eye Participating another ophthalmic clinical trial use investigational new drug within 12 week start study treatment Prior photodynamic therapy Macugen therapy choroidal neovascularization Patient history uveitis , Coat 's disease , diabetic retinopathy , glaucoma , cataract prevents visualization posterior pole</criteria>
