	<brief_title>Characteristics Prevalence Tuberculosis HIV Masiphumelele Township , Cape Town , South Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TB common opportunistic infection single common cause death HIV infect people Africa today . Latent TB infection know revert active TB follow new infection HIV infected people ; also , TB show accelerate progression HIV disease . These epidemiologic relationship TB HIV high prevalence disease sub-Saharan Africa make study TB HIV infect population region world important . The Masiphumelele Township Cape Town , South Africa , high rate TB HIV , representative many poor community Africa . The purpose study observe people Masiphumelele Township 5-year period ass prevalence TB HIV infection random sample people clinical genetic characteristic active TB infection . This study two part : random cross-sectional survey clinical genetic assessment TB patient . Participants random survey involve study maximum 2 day . The purpose first part study compare prevalence active TB prevalence HIV infection random sample people Masiphumelele Township . In part study , child adult randomly select township population determine prevalence active TB prevalence HIV infection group people . Fieldworkers identify eligible participant township ask visit clinic day next . At clinic , participant ask complete demographic TB history questionnaire provide saliva sample anonymous HIV testing . A sputum sample collect participant nebulizer ; participant also give sputum sample bottle ask collect early morning sputum sample next day return clinic . The second part study enroll TB patient . Participants part study follow course TB treatment least 6 month . The purpose second part study ass change time cluster transmission TB among HIV infect uninfected people Masiphumelele Township . This assessment include examine diversity TB strain population determine relationship recurrent case TB HIV infection . All sputum sample indicate TB infection previously collect participant undergo genetic test restriction fragment length polymorphism ( RFLP ) analysis . Participants ask complete demographic TB history questionnaire provide saliva sample anonymous HIV testing . Participants also interview treatment receive TB , responses treatment , whether currently highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) treatment HIV infection . Participants find infected TB first part study offer TB treatment clinic invite participate second part study . Participants find infected HIV study refer treatment evaluation .</detailed_description>
