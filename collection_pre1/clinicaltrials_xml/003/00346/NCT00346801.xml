	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To determine feasibility , activity , toxicity novel regimen use concurrent irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) /cisplatin celecoxib combination patient unresectable NSCLC . - To determine maximal tolerance dose celecoxib patient unresectable NSCLC treat irinotecan/cisplatin concurrent thoracic radiation therapy . - To correlate COX-2 expression biomarkers response treatment tumor pretreatment biopsy specimen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CPT-11/Cisplatin Celecoxib With Radiation Therapy Patients With Unresectable Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Celecoxib non-steroidal-anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) , similar aspirin ibuprofen . Recent study show celecoxib antitumor activity use alone . It may also increase tumor sensitivity radiation , make tumor responsive radiation therapy . Before treatment start , complete physical exam , include blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine test . You chest x-ray , CT/MRI scan , and/or PET scan . You may bone scan ( x-rays bone ) doctor feel necessary . You may also blood test , x-ray , biopsy tumor , test physician feel necessary standard care . In study , take celecoxib mouth 5 day begin radiation therapy . You continue receive celecoxib 7 day per week throughout radiation treatment ( 7 week ) . The amount drug take depend dose level assign . The dose level 200mg , 400mg , 800 mg per day . Ten patient treat dose level start low level . You require fill medication diary , document dose celecoxib take time take . You receive cisplatin CPT-11 vein Day 1 Weeks 2 8 . Chemotherapy give outpatient basis . CPT-11 infuse vein 90 minute follow cisplatin infuse 60 minute . Because cisplatin cause kidney damage , fluid may need inject `` flush '' kidney . Diuretics give vein receive cisplatin . So physician may better evaluate kidney function time , may ask save urine specimen keep record fluid take mouth first 24-48 hour receive cisplatin . Radiation therapy begin Day 1 Week 2 give time chemotherapy . The radiation therapy treatment give day 5 day week , Monday-Friday . The total treatment time individual patient decide physician , base general condition stage disease . The length radiation treatment 7 week ( 35 radiation treatment ) . During treatment , blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) every week . You report physician degree sore throat , difficulty swallowing , gastric burning , symptom concern . You take study disease becomes bad side effect become severe . After treatment complete , return follow-up visit one month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 5 year , year 10 year . At follow-up visit , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) sample collect routine lab test chest x-ray . You CT scan chest every 6 month . Complete lung function test also do . Lung function test look exchange air flow , capacity lung , flexibility lung , exchange oxygen carbon dioxide lungs . This investigational study . All drug study FDA approve commercially available . The use drug combination investigational . Between 30 40 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
