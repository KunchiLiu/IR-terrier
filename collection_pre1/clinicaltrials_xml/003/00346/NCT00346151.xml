	<brief_summary>Belatacept experimental medication show clinical trial immune system suppression property people renal ( e.g. , kidney ) transplant . This study determine whether combination anti-rejection drug , include belatacept , prevent rejection first-time , non-human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) identical renal transplant allow patient safely withdraw anti-rejection therapy one year post-transplant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Belatacept Prevent Organ Rejection Kidney Transplant Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drugs suppress immune system contribute increased success transplantation ; however , prevent organ rejection , transplant recipient need take immunosuppressive drug rest life . These drug make patient susceptible infection certain kind cancer . Belatacept experimental medication specifically target immune reaction transplant organ show effective prevent kidney transplant rejection previous clinical trial . Both thymoglobulin , antibody , sirolimus , anti-rejection drug , prevent rejection lower response immune system transplant organ . This study evaluate whether belatacept , along thymoglobulin sirolimus , safe kidney transplant patient . The study also evaluate regimen 's potential allow taper eventual discontinuation immunosuppressive drug . This study last 4 year . At time transplant , participant begin immunosuppressive treatment regimen consist thymoglobulin , sirolimus , belatacept . Participants receive infusion thymoglobulin day 1 4 , combination oral sirolimus ( daily ) belatacept infusion day 5 , week 2 , 4 , 8 , monthly least 2 year . Dose reduction belatacept occur 12 week post-transplant . At Year 2 , eligible participant may choose begin drug withdrawal continue study therapy end study . Study visit occur weekly first two month , monthly . These visit include belatacept treatment , general medical assessment , blood urine collection , assessment determine overall health recipient 's immune system kidney transplant well understand way immune system work acceptance rejection organ transplant . *** IMPORTANT NOTICE : *** The National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases Immune Tolerance Network recommend discontinuation immunosuppressive therapy recipient cell , organ , tissue transplant outside physician-directed , control clinical study . Discontinuation prescribe immunosuppressive therapy result serious health consequence perform certain rare circumstance , upon recommendation guidance health care provider .</detailed_description>
