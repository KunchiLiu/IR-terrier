	<brief_summary>This research conduct look effect intraocular drug ( pegaptanib , also call Macugen ) treatment swell retina ( light sensitive tissue back eye ) often occur follow cataract surgery patient diabetic eye disease . Swelling retina lead blurry vision , Macugen may reduce swell . Eyedrops decrease inflammation also may help stop swell . We test drug ( pegaptanib ) see decrease swell retina improve vision patient diabetes cataract surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Macugen Prevent Worsening Macular Edema Following Cataract Surgery Diabetics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Macular edema occur complication cataract surgery approximately 2 % surgery . In condition , cystic , fluid-filled space develop out plexiform layer retina result loss vision . This condition term `` Cystoid Macular Edema ( CME ) . '' In non-diabetics , majority case resolve spontaneously . Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) important cause visual disability among patient diabetes . It widely recognize cataract surgery often trigger severe CME patient pre-existing DME . This exacerbation begin immediately follow cataract surgery ; unlike non-diabetics edema likely protract poorly responsive traditional treatment CME ( topical NSAIDS ) DME ( laser photocoagulation ) . Fluorescein angiography , photographic test evaluate blood circulation back eye , demonstrate CME DME associate increased permeability retinal blood vessel . The high rate severity post-cataract surgery CME diabetic patient DME render population ideal study potential agent reduce rate severity condition ( i.e. , post-cataract surgery CME ) . Recent study show vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) play major role vessel permeability . Pegaptanib ( Macugen ) FDA-approved drug wet AMD . Pegaptanib selective VEGF antagonist block effect VEGF ; therefore pegaptanib might decrease vessel permeability possibly decrease incidence severity CME . We plan conduct control pilot study investigate effect pegaptanib ( 3 treatment pegaptanib give prior cataract surgery often every 6 week 12 week cataract surgery ) diabetic patient pre-existing DME undergoing cataract surgery , therefore , high risk development CME . Should pilot study indicate potential benefit pegaptanib setting , large , fully power clinical trial propose . An effective treatment preventive measure post-cataract surgery macular edema patient diabetic retinopathy would offer benefit large patient population nationally high risk vision loss .</detailed_description>
