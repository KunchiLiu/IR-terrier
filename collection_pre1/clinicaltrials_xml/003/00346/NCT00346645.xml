	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Velcade® Patients Stage IIIB OR IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy non-small-cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , mainly Cisplatin-based combination , provide measurable modest survival benefit select patient advanced disease . Advanced NSCLC remain largely fatal , positive impact chemotherapy limit intrinsic acquire resistance , manifest clinically early progression transient response . Current chemotherapy regimen limit efficacy magnitude survival benefit still modest , lead significant toxicity , many patient unable receive kind treatment , even first line set . There , therefore , great need provide patient less toxic agent novel targeted therapy , potential improve efficacy maintain good quality life . Bortezomib , proteasome inhibitor , show benefit single agent pretreated patient similar less toxicity compare chemotherapy . The current project phase II trial include 46 patient advanced NSCLC without prior chemotherapy . An early tumor assessment ( 6 week therapy ) perform , combine regular clinical symptom assessment allow rapid appropriate management non-responding patient , cross another therapy per investigator patient choice . The primary objective efficacy bortezomib determine rate progression 6 week . Secondary objective efficacy bortezomib determine objective response rate ( incidence CR PR ) , disease control rate ( CR , PR stabilization ) , duration disease control , duration objective response , progression-free survival , overall survival , safety bortezomib , rate doublet therapy second line .</detailed_description>
