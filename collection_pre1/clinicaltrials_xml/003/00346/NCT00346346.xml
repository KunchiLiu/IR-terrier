	<brief_summary>This study examine immune response malaria parasite cellular level well understand people achieve natural immunity parasite multiple infection immunity diminishes rapidly absence ongoing infection . The result study may provide insight whether natural immunity improve upon vaccination . Healthy people 2-4 18-25 year age live village Kambila , Mali , may eligible 1-year study . Participants small blood sample collect vein arm also two finger prick begin study , every 2 month 6 month end study ( total five sample ) . People become ill malaria evaluate treated physician . Those recover first episode malaria study period another blood sample collection two finger prick ( bring six total number sample collect ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Analysis Immune Response Malaria Parasite Mali , West Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria remain important public health threat , responsible one million death annually , majority among African child . The development safe effective vaccine widely regard crucial step forward control disease . However , vaccine test clinical trial date result short-lived protection best . This appear mirror kinetics naturally acquire immunity Plasmodium falciparum , multiple infection require many year clinical immunity achieve , appear diminish relatively rapidly absence ongoing infection . The mechanisms underlying delayed acquisition presumably rapid loss humoral immunity poorly understood . A detailed understanding process cellular level may provide insight whether natural immunity improve upon vaccination . This longitudinal cohort study P. falciparum endemic village Mali propose test hypothesis resistance malaria associate acquisition P. falciparum specific memory B cell . The 52 week study cover entire malaria transmission season enroll 224 healthy person age 2 10 18 25 . After informed consent obtain participant , participant 's parent guardian , age appropriate volume venous blood drawn baseline , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month thereafter ; serum peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) frozen store . One convalescent blood sample per participant also draw within two week first symptomatic P. falciparum infection . Clinical data , include frequency severity malaria infection , collect study period passive surveillance . After 52 week , serum PBMC thaw analyzed determine antibody titer malaria antigen enumerate relevant B cell subpopulation , include total antigen-specific naive , memory , plasma cell ELISPOT assay flow cytometry .</detailed_description>
