	<brief_title>Endoscopic Implantation Enteryx Treatment GERD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Enteryx procedure kit indicate endoscopic injection region lower esophageal sphincter ( LES ) treatment symptom due gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) symptoms patient respond require daily pharmacological therapy proton pump inhibitor ( PPI 's ) . The study design consist two part , Part A Part B . Part A enroll patient receive Enteryx treatment approval Part B enroll patient previously enrol treat IDE study # G000065 . In total least 300 patient enrolled Part A Part B 36 month follow-up Part A : Approximately 150 200 patient enrol 22 center . After patient determine physician Enteryx appropriate course therapy GERD symptom , ask participate trial . Patients follow adverse event , medication use , GERD-HRQL symptom baseline , day treatment , one month , six month , twelve month , twenty-four month , thirty-six month . The final study visit thirty-six month last Enteryx injection . In addition , Part A patient contacted Site least quarterly obtain current adverse event information . This adverse event information solicit Site Sponsor least quarterly . Part B : All US IDE patient ( approximately 150 patient ) ask enroll . Patients follow adverse event , medication use , GERD-HRQL symptom two visit beyond follow-up prescribed IDE study , namely 24 36 month last Enteryx injection receive IDE study . Parts A B : There breakdown adverse event base retreatment status . Any subsequent procedure intervention related GERD Enteryx , whether surgical ( fundoplication ) non-surgical ( alternative endoscopic treatment GERD ) , collect report . H0 : ( Null hypothesis ) : Proportion patient exhibit clinically significant improvement reduction PPI therapy ≤ 0.5 Ha : ( Alt . hypothesis ) : Proportion patient exhibit clinically significant improvement reduction PPI therapy &gt; 0.5 The Sponsor examine proportion patient clinically significant reduction PPI therapy 12 , 24 36 month follow-up , identical manner use patient IDE trial . The `` clinically significant reduction '' define either elimination medication use reduction dosage ≥50 % . The criterion success define half patient demonstrate degree medication reduction . The hypothesis test p-value construction exact 95 % Clopper-Pearson confidence interval around observed proportion patient meet criterion success . The longitudinal post-procedure follow-up data across time ( repeated measure ) analyze determine pattern trend primary endpoint . The hypothesis state also evaluate subset patient underwent retreatment prior amendment v.14Oct05 .</detailed_description>
