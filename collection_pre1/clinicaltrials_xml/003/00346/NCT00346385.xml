	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , BB-10901 , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose BB-10901 treating patient relapse refractory solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BB-10901 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety tolerability BB-10901 - Determine maximum tolerate dose drug patient . Secondary - Determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . - Determine efficacy drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive BB-10901 IV 40 minute daily day 1-3 . * Treatment repeat every 21 day NOTE : *Patients tolerate 3 consecutive daily infusion BB-10901 may receive infusion BB-10901 3 alternate day , upon approval investigator and/or independent Safety Review Board . Cohorts 4-6 patient receive escalate dos BB-10901 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 4-6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity course 1 . Up 40 patient treated MTD . After completion study treatment , patient follow short term long term follow survival . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 100 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
