	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy surgery may kill remain tumor cell . It yet know combination chemotherapy regimen effective treat early stage breast cancer remove surgery . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study four different combination chemotherapy regimens compare well work treat patient early stage breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer That Has Been Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare disease-free survival ( DFS ) patient completely resect early stage breast cancer receive 1 2 different schedule adjuvant chemotherapy comprising epirubicin , cyclophosphamide , methotrexate , fluorouracil versus 1 2 different schedule adjuvant chemotherapy comprise epirubicin capecitabine . Secondary - Compare overall survival ( OS ) distant disease-free survival ( DFS ) . - Compare tolerability ( include serious adverse event [ SAE ] , dose-intensity , toxicity ) regimens . - Determine detailed toxicity regimen . - Determine quality life subset patient . OUTLINE : This multi-center , randomize study . Patients stratify accord participate center , nodal status ( N0 vs N1-3 v N≥ 4 ) , age ( ≤ 50 year vs &gt; 50 year ) , estrogen receptor ( ER ) status ( negative v positive ) . Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive epirubicin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course . Patients receive cyclophosphamide orally daily day 1-14 IV day 1 8 methotrexate fluorouracil day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course . - Arm II : Patients receive epirubicin day 1 pegfilgrastim day 2 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 4 course . Patients receive cyclophosphamide , methotrexate fluorouracil arm I . - Arm III : Patients receive epirubicin arm I . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Treatment capecitabine repeat every 3 week 4 course . - Arm IV : Patients receive epirubicin pegfilgrastim arm II . Patients receive capecitabine arm III . In arm , treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3-6 month later , patient may undergo radiotherapy discretion principal investigator . Patients ER- and/or progesterone receptor-positive disease receive tamoxifen citrate aromatase inhibitor 5 year . Quality life assess cohort 1,000 patient week 6 , week 8 12 , week 20 24 treatment 12 24 month randomization . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually least 10 year . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 4,400 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
