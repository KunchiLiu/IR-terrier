	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-group study evaluate efficacy safety two fixed dos galantamine ( 16 24 milligram per day [ mg/day ] ) patient Alzheimer 's disease , investigate dose-response . The study consist 4-week screening period patient receive placebo , 22-week double-blind treatment period patient receive placebo , galantamine 16 mg/day , galantamine 24 mg/day . For patient receive galantamine treatment , start dose 8 mg/day increase 4-week interval increment 8 mg/day . The primary measure effectiveness change baseline end study ( week 22 ) Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale - Japan cognitive subscale ( ADAS-J cog ) Clinician 's Interview-Based Impression Change plus - Japan ( CIBIC plus-J ) . Safety assessment include incidence adverse event , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , physical examination finding . The study hypothesis galantamine effective treatment Alzheimer 's disease placebo . Study drug take orally twice day . 4-week screening period : All patient receive placebo . 22-week treatment period : Patients receive placebo , galantamine 16 mg/day , 24 mg/day .
