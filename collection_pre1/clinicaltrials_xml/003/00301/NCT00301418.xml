	<brief_summary>This study offer safe treatment patient relapse recur glioblastoma ( GBM ) anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) . The trial test hypothesis Erlotinib ( Tarceva , OSI-774 ) safely use dose 150 mg two time day 12 month ultimately enhance survival patient relapsed/refractory GBM/AA . Correlation response Tarceva particular genetic alteration include epidermal growth factor receptor variant type III ( EGFRvIII ) amplification phosphatase tensin homolog ( mutate multiple advanced cancer 1 ) ( PTEN ) loss study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Tarceva Study Recurrent/Residual Glioblastoma Multiforme Anaplastic Astrocytoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high-grade malignant brain tumor , glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) anaplastic astrocytoma ( AA ) , comprise majority primary brain tumor adult . This group tumor also exhibit aggressive behavior , result median overall survival duration 9-12 month GBM , 3-4 year AA , initial diagnosis , despite multimodal treatment approach . Initial therapy consist either surgical resection , external beam radiation . The role adjuvant concomitant chemotherapy initial therapy GBM AA , yet , clearly define . Since patient experience recurrence first-line therapy , improvement first-line salvage therapy critical enhance quality-of-life prolonging survival . In August 2003 , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) grant orphan drug status Erlotinib patient malignant glioma . Erlotinib ( OSI-774 ) show active range tumor include GBM , AA non small cell lung cancer . Because promising result preliminary study Erlotinib significant experience safety dosage propose study , study offer safe adjuvant treatment patient relapse recur glioblastoma anaplastic astrocytoma . Therefore , phase I/II clinical research trial test hypothesis Erlotinib safely use dose 150 mg bid 12 cycle ultimately enhance survival patient relapsed/refractory GBM/AA particular genetic alteration include EGFRvIII amplification PTEN loss .</detailed_description>
