In addition , infant experience wheeze may small dysfunctional airway may respond well commonly prescribe anti-inflammatory medication . Because many cause wheeze , order prescribe effective treatment , necessary thoroughly assess lung function , allergic sensitization , airway inflammation . The purpose study examine cause moderate severe wheeze infant assess infant ' response inhale corticosteroid therapy . The study also assess new safer way measure lung function airway inflammation . This study enroll infant moderate severe persistent wheezing . At study entry , participant undergo lung function testing , include spirometry test , measure lung volume , assessment bronchodilator responsiveness . Exhaled breath condensate blood collect , skin-prick testing perform test allergy . Participants randomly assign receive either fluticasone , inhale steroid , placebo one month . At end month , lung function test perform exhaled breath serum measure collect assess airway inflammation . Participants attend follow-up evaluation age 5 year . During evaluation , lung function , exhale breath condensate , serum marker inflammation measure , skin-prick testing also perform .</detailed_description>
