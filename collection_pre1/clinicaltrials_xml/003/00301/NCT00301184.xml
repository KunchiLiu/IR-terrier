	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response DNA HIV Vaccine ( pGA2/JS7 ) Boosted With Modified Vaccinia HIV Vaccine ( MVA/HIV62 ) Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The worldwide HIV/AIDS epidemic may control safe effective vaccine prevent HIV infection . DNA vaccine inexpensive construct , easily produce large quantity , stable long periods time . Recombinant modify vaccinia Ankara vaccine show safe human , immunogenicity administration vaccine encourage . When use together , robust immunologic response associate DNA HIV vaccine administration follow modified vaccinia vaccine administration , compare use either DNA vaccinia vaccine alone . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity experimental DNA HIV vaccine prime , pGA/JS7 , follow similarly structure modify vaccinia boost , MVA/HIV62 , HIV uninfected adult . Participants study recruit United States . This study divide 2 part . Each participant involve part study 1 year . Participants Part 1 randomly assign one two different vaccination group . Group 1A participant randomly assign receive either placebo 2 low dos DNA HIV vaccine ( DNA ) study entry Month 2 , follow 2 low dos modify vaccinia vaccine ( MVA ) Months 4 6 . Group 1B enroll safety immunogenicity data Group 1A evaluate . Group 1B participant receive either placebo two high dos DNA study entry Month 2 , follow two high dos MVA Months 4 6 . Enrollment Part 2 begin safety data Part 1 reviewed . In Part 2 , participant randomly assign one two different vaccination group . Within group , participant randomly assign receive series vaccine placebo . Group 2A participant receive either placebo maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) Part 1 DNA study entry MTD MVA Months 2 6 . Group 2B participant receive MTD MVA study entry Months 2 6 . There 12 study visit 12 month Groups 1 2 . There 11 study visit 12 month Groups 3 4 . Medication history , physical exam , interview , HIV pregnancy prevention counseling , adverse event report occur visit . Blood urine collection electrocardiogram ( ECG ) occur select visit .</detailed_description>
