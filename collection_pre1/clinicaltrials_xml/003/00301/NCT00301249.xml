	<detailed_description>Diabetic Nephropathy ( DN ) undoubtedly multifactorial disease , large proportion patient affect either type 1 type 2 diabetes develop diabetic nephropathy progress end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . When poor prognostic factor hypertension chronic hyperglycemia aggressively treat , rate progression diabetic nephropathy slow . However , intervention show reliably halt progression diabetic nephropathy . Numerous study suggest genetic predisposition diabetic nephropathy exists , gene nephropathy yet isolate . It anticipate comprehensive analysis large number uniformly phenotyped ESRD family necessary isolate gene ESRD . Such database family may available single institution . The FIND study establish centralize Genetic Analysis Data Coordinating Center ( GADCC ) , together eight participate investigation center ( PICs ) , three minority recruitment center , National Institute Diabetes , Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) , use emerge high-throughput genetic technology enable identification diabetic nephropathy susceptibility protection gene . The charge consortium acquire sets family well-characterized diabetic nephropathy , establish secure master FIND database , perform genome scan identify chromosomal region link diabetic nephropathy . The FIND study population include participant European American ( EA ) , Native American ( NA ) , African American ( AA ) Mexican American ( AA ) population . Two analytic approach utilized FIND . The Family Study approach involve enrollment probands , affect discordant sibling affect family member . Analytic method include affected sibling pair ( ASP ) , discordant sibling pair ( DSP ) affect relative pair ( ARP ) , discordant relative pair ( DRP ) linkage analyse Family Study . The Mapping Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium ( MALD ) approach involve enrollment probands population base control AA MA study . In addition , spousal control ( diad ) available , child 18 year old , recruit ( triad ) AA MALD study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For Family protocol , proband must meet diagnostic criterion diabetes nephropathy meet one following : diabetic nephropathy diagnose kidney biopsy history overt proteinuria . ESRD consider due diabetic nephropathy diabetes present ≥ 5 year prior initiation renal replacement therapy diabetic retinopathy diagnose time ; diabetes present ≥ 5 year prior initiation replacement therapy either 24 hour urine collection contain ≥ 3 gm protein/24 hour random urine protein ( mg/dl ) / creatinine ( mg/dl ) ratio ≥ 3.0 ; diabetic retinopathy present either previous 24 hour urine collection contain ≥ 3 gm protein/24 hour random urine protein ( mg/dl ) / creatinine ( mg/dl ) ratio ≥ 3.0. nephropathy without ESRD consider diabetic nephropathy ( ) diabetic retinopathy 24 hr urine collection either ≥ 1 gram proteinuria/24 hour urine protein ( mg/dl ) / creatinine ( mg/dl ) ratio ≥ 1.0 ; ( b ) time diabetes duration ≥ 10 year , either urine collection ≥ 3 gram protein/24 hour urine protein ( mg/dl ) /creatinine ( mg/dl ) ratio ≥ 3.0 . AfricanAmerican patient chronic renal failure MALD case meet criterion diabetic nephropathy , describe Family probands , nephropathy ( serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl ) due diabetes know monogenic renal disease . MexicanAmericans recruit MALD case must meet criterion diabetic nephropathy define Family probands . Phenotype criterion probands enter Family MALD protocols must confirm medical record review . Eligibility family member MALD control subject base laboratory test obtain time screen . Entry proband diabetic nephropathy Family protocol also require participation either two live parent least one full sibling diabetes . To enrol nephropathy , diabetic sib must meet one follow criterion : renal biopsy consistent diagnosis diabetic nephropathy ; urinary albumin excretion ≥ 30 mg/24hr urine albumin ( mg/dl ) /creatinine ( mg/dl ) ratio ≥ 0.03 ; serum creatinine concentration ≥ 1.6 mg/dl men ≥ 1.4 mg/dl woman ; ESRD . Unaffected sib recruit diabetes ≥ 10 year , normal serum creatinine albumin excretion ( &lt; 30 mg albumin/24 hour , urine albumin ( mg/dl ) /creatinine ( mg/dl ) ratio &lt; 0.03 ) historical evidence kidney disease . The criterion MALD control subject differ ethnic group . For AfricanAmerican MALD protocol , two different control sample recruit . First , adult offspring without renal disease parent offspring , evidence renal disease , collect control AfricanAmerican probands either diabetic nondiabetic nephropathy . Together probands , form sample triad ( offspring parent ) dyads ( spouse ) . A second group AfricanAmerican control subject consist unrelated individual diabetes duration ≥ 10 year without nephropathy ( define diabetic sib ) . For Mexican Americans , single unrelated control population recruit diabetes duration ≥ 10 year without nephropathy ( define diabetic sib ) . A . Did sign inform consent : refusal participate . B . Diagnosis confirm . C. Appropriate sibling available . D. Judged likely unable follow study protocol . E. Ethnicity parent grandparent suitable . F. Spouse available .</criteria>
