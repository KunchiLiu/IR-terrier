	<detailed_description>The initial management follow-up patient present chronic intermittent obstruction depend clinical , biological factor image data , include presence degree dilatation pelvo-caliceal cavity functional consequence obstruction . The primary objective study : - evaluate feasibility reliability measurement relative renal function MR urography compare renal scintigraphy management patient present chronic intermittent urinary obstruction adult child . - accuracy two method demonstrate equivalent , conduct medico-economic evaluation functional MR Urography compare renal scintigraphy , show potential low cost . The secondary objective : - compare diagnostic accuracy various parameter analysis functional MR urography data , previously publish literature , determine indicator predict urinary obstruction - evaluate interest indicator surgical treatment obstruction , follow-up patient - draw program analysis treatment MR urography data , available centre whatever MR unit . The current study multicentric , observational , prospective design evaluation diagnostic strategy . It include 16 French hospital . The main clinical hypothesis one single MR examination , association morphological diagnostic phase functional phase , possible extract functional parameter accuracy renal scintigraphy determination relative renal function . The targeted recruitment 550 patient two year . The MR scintigraphy collect data review one site expert end study . The university hospital Nancy charge coordinate study . Points expect impact study : 1. shorten duration patient management replace two examination ( MR scintigraphy ) one single examination ( MR ) 2. reduction deliver exposure diagnostic radiation , eliminate renal scintigraphy initial diagnostic follow-up child adult . 3. potential application improve spatial resolution MR urography correction artefacts respiratory motion . 4. publication clinical recommendation National Scientific Societies support trial .</detailed_description>
