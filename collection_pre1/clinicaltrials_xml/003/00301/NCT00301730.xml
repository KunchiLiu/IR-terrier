	<brief_title>Cellular Adoptive Immunotherapy Treating Patient Who Has Undergone Donor Stem Cell Transplant Breast Cancer That Has Spread Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine antitumor response patient persistent metastatic breast cancer prior allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) treat tumor-derived , ex vivo expand costimulated T-lymphocytes . Secondary - Evaluate immune function tumor-derived T-lymphocytes biology residual tumor cell present allogeneic hematopoietic SCT . OUTLINE : This pilot study . The patient undergoes surgical resection accessible lesion T cell isolate , costimulated , expand ex vivo produce tumor-derived T-lymphocytes ( TDTL ) . Beginning least 2 week surgery , patient receives TDTL IV every 4 week 5 dos presence disease progression ( DP ) AND absence ≥ grade 2 graft-versus-host disease . The patient assess 4 week every dose . In case stable disease , partial response , complete response , patient follow without intervention DP . In case DP dose 1 2 TDTL , patient receives dose 2 3 TDTL . In case DP dose 3 TDTL , patient receive low-dose interleukin-2 subcutaneously ( SC ) daily 3 day dose 4 TDTL . In case DP dose 4 TDTL , patient receive 1 course chemoimmunotherapy cytoreduction immunomodulation comprise paclitaxel IV 3 hour trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) IV 30-90 minute weekly 3 week ( patient may receive gemcitabine hydrochloride , vinorelbine ditartrate , docetaxel , capecitabine combination trastuzumab [ Herceptin® ] chemoimmunotherapy discretion principal investigator ) ; interleukin-2 SC daily 3 day ; dose 5 TDTL . In case DP dose 5 TDTL , patient may receive cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or FDA-approved biologic therapy and/or immunotherapy donor lymphocyte infusion donor use prior allogeneic stem cell transplantation . The patient may undergo core biopsy leave mediastinal nodule case tumor regression index lesion anytime OR receive dose 5 TDTL . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : One patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
