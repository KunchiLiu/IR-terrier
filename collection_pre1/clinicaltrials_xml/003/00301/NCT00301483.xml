	<brief_title>A Single Site Safety Tolerability Study HBOC-201 Trauma Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II study single-center , randomize , single-blind , parallel-group , standard therapy-controlled , variable dose study HBOC 201 administer trauma subject bleed potential bleeding require standard fluid therapy treatment hypoperfusion . The type incidence adverse event serious adverse event attribute study drug analyze . Secondary variable safety tolerability study , summarize descriptive statistic frequency table . The purpose data collection ass efficacy variable feasibility utilize parameter future trauma study assess parameter morbidity mortality include , limited : - Time improvement serum ( plasma ) lactate - Time improvement Base Deficit - Time maintain stability ( BD &lt; 5 ) 24 hour - Overall improvement Base Deficit 24 Hours - Stability subject 24 hour - Time meet treatment-stopping criterion - Volume meet treatment-stopping criterion - Incidence infectious complication ( e.g. , incidence ventilator-associated pneumonia ) - Length time ventilator - Incidence multiple organ dysfunction ( MOD ) Hemorrhage subsequent hypoperfusion major cause immediate delay death subject sustain traumatic injury . Effective therapy hemorrhage treat hypoperfusion give immediately follow injury lack . The following issue confound problem : - Hemorrhaging trauma victim often immediate need therapy ensure adequate delivery oxygen vital tissue ; - Standard care fluid Lactated Ringers Solution provide oxygen blood readily store , transport easily use pre-hospital setting - In absence oxygen-carrying fluid , traditional approach sustain vital organ perfusion , administration intravenous fluid therapy , may detrimental effect give prior hemostasis certain subject , particularly penetrate truncal injury .</detailed_description>
