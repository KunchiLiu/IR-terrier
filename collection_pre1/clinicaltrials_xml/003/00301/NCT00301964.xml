	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well bevacizumab work treat patient recurrent persistent endometrial cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess activity bevacizumab , term 6-month progression-free survival rate objective tumor response , patient recurrent persistent endometrial cancer . II . Determine nature degree toxicity bevacizumab patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine duration progression-free survival overall survival patient . II . Determine effect prognostic factor , include performance status histological grade . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
