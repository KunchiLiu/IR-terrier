	<brief_title>Antiretroviral Treatment Simplified Follow-up Management Assessment ( ANRS 12110 STRATALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Justification Access antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) still limit Africa ( 11 % patient immediate need June 2005 ) . Face scope need constraint ( unavailability cost viral load CD4 cell count , lack physicians… ) , WHO develop follow-up approach base simplified monitoring . This `` simplified '' approach restrict use complementary exam include biologic criterion effectiveness tolerability , people consider approach dangerous patient also community ( rapid emergence resistance ) would preferable treat less patient gold standard approach . In practice , `` simplify '' approach represent major stake expand access ART little evaluate gold standard approach . Objectives Main objective : To compare increase CD4 cell count patient receive ART `` simplify '' approach treat gold standard approach district hospital . Secondary objective : To compare two approach virologic effectiveness , survival , treatment interruption , number patient lose follow-up , clinical progression , clinical biologic tolerability , adherence , emergence drug resistance , impact patient ' daily life , acceptability patient health professional , cost-effectiveness performance . Methods Randomised , control , multicentre , non inferiority , intervention trial , without blind approach , 9 district hospital Province du Centre Cameroon . 430 adult patient randomise two group ( `` simplify '' approach gold standard approach ) 1:1 ratio follow 24 month . In `` simplified '' approach , result HIV-1 viral load CD4 cell count available management patient , biologic assessment tolerability limit clinical consultation perform nurse physician ' responsibility ; remainder similar gold standard approach . Planning The study start first semester 2006 . The full length study would 36 month maximum ( 12 month enrolment 24 month follow-up ) . Expected result Advices increase access ART Africa .</detailed_description>
