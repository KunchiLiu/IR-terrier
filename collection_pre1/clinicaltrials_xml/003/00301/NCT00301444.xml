	<brief_summary>The researcher propose conduct pilot study efficacy mirror-box mental visualization treatment phantom limb pain . The trial last 4 month first month , data gather daily number episode phantom limb pain , average length episode , average intensity pain , bad intensity pain . In addition , rapidity pain relief , length therapy need sustain long-lasting pain relief , whether use two treatment method rehabilitation provide sustain and/or permanent pain relief determine . Cognitive testing also perform determine effect limb amputation cognition mood result compare on-going study similar effect patient chronic ( &gt; 3 month ) limb amputation . The inclusion subject phantom limb pain upper extremity amputation recently approve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total forty-eight ( 48 ) subject enrol - twenty-four ( 24 ) unilateral low limb amputation twenty-four ( 24 ) unilateral upper limb amputation . Subjects randomize assignment three treatment condition : eight ( 8 ) low eight ( 8 ) upper limb subject ( 50 % left-sided amputation ) use mental visualization foot hand movement , eight ( 8 ) low eight ( 8 ) upper limb subject ( 50 % left-sided amputation ) use open mirror- box visualize reflect image intact foot hand , eight ( 8 ) low eight ( 8 ) upper limb subject ( 50 % left-sided amputation ) use closed mirror- box ( unable visualize reflect image ) . Subjects use assign therapy 20 minute daily . Subjects use close mirror-box mental visualization treatment switch mirror therapy significantly improve follow 4 week . The subject study recruit Walter Reed Army Medical Center Amputee clinic . Up sixty ( 60 ) subject recruit screen accord inclusion exclusion criterion since expect may qualify drop-out sooner schedule 4-month completion time .</detailed_description>
