	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , epratuzumab rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin , vincristine , prednisone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving monoclonal antibody therapy together chemotherapy may kill cancer cells. &gt; PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give monoclonal antibody therapy together combination chemotherapy work treat patient stage II , stage III , stage IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : &gt; Primary &gt; - Assess efficacy epratuzumab rituximab combination cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine , prednisone ( CHOP ) , measure 12-month , event-free survival , patient previously untreated stage II , III , IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. &gt; - Assess use positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan routinely early treatment completion treatment. &gt; - Assess functional response rate ( complete response , partial response , stable disease CT scan PET negative ) patient treat regimen. &gt; - Assess safety treatment regimen. &gt; Secondary &gt; - Correlate laboratory prognostic factor large cell lymphoma clinical response regimen. &gt; OUTLINE : This multicenter study. &gt; Patients receive epratuzumab IV 1 hour day 1 , rituximab IV 4-8 hour day 1 day 1 2 , cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine IV day 1 2 , oral prednisone day 1-5 2-6 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity. &gt; After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 years. &gt; PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 86 patient accrue study . &gt;</detailed_description>
