	<brief_summary>Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Oblimersen may help rituximab work well make cancer cell sensitive drug . This phase II trial study well give rituximab together oblimersen work treat patient stage II , stage III , stage IV follicular non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Oblimersen Treating Patients With Stage II , Stage III , Stage IV Follicular Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( overall complete response rate ) rituximab + oblimersen sodium extended induction therapy previously untreated cluster differentiation 20 positive ( CD20+ ) follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) patient . II . To determine time progression rituximab + oblimersen sodium extended induction therapy previously untreated CD20+ follicular NHL patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity profile rituximab + oblimersen sodium therapy previously untreated CD20+ follicular NHL patient . II . To establish whether therapeutic effect rituximab + oblimersen sodium combination sufficiently promise warrant evaluation subsequent randomize trial ( comparison rituximab alone ) . III . To correlate Fc receptor profile response rituximab + oblimersen sodium previously untreated patient follicular NHL . IV . To determine relationship change fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( FDG ) uptake early treatment rituximab + oblimersen sodium response rate time progression . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Induction therapy ( month 1 ) : Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 1-7 15-21 rituximab IV day 3 , 10 , 17 , 24 month 1 . Extended induction therapy ( month 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 ) : Patients receive oblimersen IV continuously day 22-28 rituximab IV day 24 month 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 . Treatment continue 9 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 52 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
