	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Zoledronate ibandronate may prevent help relieve bone pain symptom cause bone metastasis . It yet know whether zoledronate effective ibandronate prevent bone problem cause bone metastasis due breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study zoledronate see well work compare ibandronate prevent bone problem woman stage IV breast cancer spread bone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0308 Zoledronate Ibandronate Preventing Bone Problems Women With Stage IV Breast Cancer That Has Spread Bone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy zoledronate v ibandronate , term prevent occurrence skeletal-related event ( SRE ) ( e.g. , fracture , spinal cord compression , radiotherapy surgery bone symptoms event , hypercalcemia ≥ grade 3 ) , woman stage IV breast cancer bone metastasis . Secondary - Compare change patient-reported measure pain use analgesic patient treat drug . - Compare time first clinically apparent SRE patient treat drug . - Compare toxicity drug . - Compare change performance status overall survival patient treat drug . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize study . Patients stratify accord hormone receptor status ( estrogen receptor [ ER ] progesterone receptor [ PR ] negative v ER and/or PR positive ) current evidence fracture ( vertebral nonvertebral ) spinal compression ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral ibandronate daily day 1-28 . - Arm II : Patients receive zoledronate IV 15 minute day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 18 course absence unacceptable toxicity . Quality life pain assessed baseline , every 3 course study treatment , end study treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 488 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
