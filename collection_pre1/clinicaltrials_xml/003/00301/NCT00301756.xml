	<brief_title>Belinostat Treating Patients With Advanced Ovarian Epithelial Cancer , Primary Peritoneal Cancer , Fallopian Tube Cancer Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine antitumor activity PXD 101 single agent follow patient population use objective response rate ( complete partial ) : ) Platinum resistant ovarian carcinoma ( progression within 6 month platinum base therapy ) ; b ) Micropapillary / borderline ( Low Malignant potential ) ovarian carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine antitumor activity PXD 101 regard stable disease rate , duration response , progression- free , median overall survival rate well determine safety tolerability drug . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine relationship clinical pharmacodynamic effect PXD101 patient platinum resistant micropapillary tumor undergo treatment drug . OUTLINE : Patients receive belinostat intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
