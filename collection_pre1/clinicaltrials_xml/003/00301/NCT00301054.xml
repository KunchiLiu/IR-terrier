	<detailed_description>I . INTRODUCTION Anaemia child major problem develop country 1 . Iron deficiency believe common form anaemia child . In country fortification common food child iron lead decrease morbidity mortality associate iron deficiency anemia.2 In malaria endemic area , anaemia child make bad incidence malaria . Brief Background District Berekum District one thirteen administrative district Brong Ahafo Region Ghana total surface area 1094.2 sq.km . The estimate population base 2000 census growth rate 2.5 % approximately 102,914 year 2004.Male female ratio district 1:1.1 . The inhabitant mainly Brongs ethnic group country . 55.3 % population live rural area . II . PROBLEM ANALYSIS Anaemia recognise worldwide public health problem . It estimate World Health Organization prevalence anaemia define haemoglobin less 11.0g/dl 33 % .5 In Berekum District prevalence anaemia child define haemoglobin concentration le 10.0g/dl find 80 % nutritional survey carry community district 1994.6 Anaemia one major cause mortality child five year Ghana . III . AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The aim study establish effective way prevent anaemia child community level . The specific objective study : 1 . To determine impact weekly iron supplementation prevention anaemia , increase haemoglobin , growth parameter , susceptibility malaria ( treatment ) child 6-30months . 2 . To determine impact monthly sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine administration prevention anaemia , increase haemoglobin , growth parameter , susceptibility malaria ( treatment ) child 6-30months . 3 . To determine intervention effective prevent anaemia increase haemoglobin concentration child age 6-30months compare placebo . 4 . To determine synergistic effect give iron sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine preventing anaemia child age 6-30months . 5 . To find percentage child adverse reaction give Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine . 6 . To determine difference incidence clinical case vaccine preventable disease among intervention group compare placebo . STUDY TYPE This Randomized double blind placebo-controlled study try ass effectiveness three intervention prevent anaemia community . STUDY POPULATION The universe population child 6months – 30months reside community Berekum District . The target population child 6months- 30months living Berekum District attend well baby clinic . The study population child age 6months- 30months attend well baby clinic twenty immunization sit district . Those attend child welfare clinic day research team visit choose fall within age range mother agree let take part study . SAMPLING Using 2x2 factorial design , sample size 189 per four group require measure difference haemoglobin concentration group within 0.5g/dl true value ( alpha = 0.05 ) . With estimate drop rate 15 % total sample size approximately 872 218 per group use . The placebo group represent child welfare service currently available child district , rest country , little ethical concern raise recruit child placebo group . They also help determine difference occurrence clinical case three vaccine preventable disease ( measles , acute flaccid paralysis whooping cough ) among child intervention group compare placebo group , use proxy indicator possible adverse EPI vaccine intervention interaction . An assumption make since district homogenous consist mainly one tribe predominantly , child select various site differ markedly term diet exposure factor might lead anaemia . Furthermore , 98 % child welfare attendance coverage District . Therefore , child attend child welfare clinic quite representative community . Children twenty immunization/child welfare clinic site district randomly assign one four study group , obtain consent parent enrol study . A simple randomization scheme utilized . Given trial size , balance treatment/placebo group size anticipate . A recruitment questionnaire complete child recruit study . INTERVENTIONS The intervention use : 1 . Weekly iron supplementation Iron ( II ) Sulphate tablet dose 2mg/kg body weight monthly placebo resemble sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine tablet . 2 . Weekly placebo resemble Iron ( II ) Sulphate tablet monthly treatment sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine accord body weight ( ¼ tablet &lt; 5kg , ½ tablet 5-10 kg 1 tablet 10-15kg . 3 . Weekly iron supplementation Iron ( II ) Sulphate tablet dose 2mg/kg body weight monthly Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine tablet 4 . Weekly placebo resemble iron ( II ) sulphate tablet monthly placebo resemble sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine tablet Interventions pre-packed label drug code number manufacturer . Children randomly assign pre-packed drug community health nurse work community . Community health nurse aware intervention child receive . Code child hold seal kept drug manufacturer , till data ready analysis . To ensure compliance , every week community health nurse visit community give drug child direct observation . FOLLOW-UP The intervention give child period 6months.Children follow another 3months post-intervention . Community Health Nurses visit child weekly ass cutaneous reaction check axillary temperature . At baseline , 2months , 4months , 6months 9months blood sample take measure haemoglobin concentration g/dl ass anaemia . Haemoglobin concentration measure twice child occasion . Malaria determine look thick thin blood film , stain read use standard procedure look asexual form P falciparum4 . Children see community community health nurse axillary temperature 37.5 Celsius without complication treat Chloroquine accord weight ; complicate malaria admit ward . The project pay treatment . Haemoglobin electrophoresis sickle cell do use cellulose acetate . The weight length child take baseline , 2months , 4months , 6months 9months four community health nurse work immunization site . V. PLAN FOR DATA ANALYSIS Data analyze use Epi 2000.Difference Haemoglobin change group period determine use Student t-test 95 % confidence interval . Proportion weight age length age ratio –2SD +2SD Plasmodium falciparum thick peripheral blood film calculate . These two proportion compare two intervention placebo various time period use Chi-square analysis ; determine significance difference proportion intervention 95 % confidence interval compare compare placebo group . Average febrile episode compare intervention placebo use ANOVA determine significance difference 95 % confidence interval . VI . ETHICAL ISSUES Proposal study submit National committee ethic Research . Interventions use long history use side-effects already know document . Giving Iron supplementation child public health intervention do lot setting prevent anaemia find safe . Use sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine treating malaria also extensive especially Southern part Africa . Children closely monitor , mother require report adverse reaction notice . Children appear react adversely intervention drop study . . Mothers ’ access routine health service child affect mother ’ refusal participate study . Verbal inform consent obtain mother choose child .</detailed_description>
