	<brief_summary>Turbinates large structure nasal airway help nose clean humidify air breathe . Inferior turbinates swell block breathing passage , make hard breath . To address , turbinate size must reduce . This study look two common procedure turbinate reduction : 1 . Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA ) involve insert special needle inferior ( low ) turbinate release thermal energy , significantly reduce size . This do local anesthesia doctor 's office . 2 . Partial Resection Inferior Turbinate ( PRIT ) involve surgically remove piece turbinate , also reduce size . While procedure improve nasal obstruction , study directly compare effective . Eighty patient treat septal deformity turbinate hypertrophy randomly choose either PRIT RFA treatment . They fill simple , five question survey measure view nasal blockage 4 time one year . We believe since PRIT permanently remove part turbinate , PRIT patient report improvement RFA patient one year later . We believe complication ( measure doctor ) treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjective nasal obstruction usually cause intranasal anatomic obstruction . A critical area anterior nasal valve , nasal septal deformity inferior turbinate hypertrophy often combine produce symptomatic obstruction anterior valve . Surgical treatment reduce turbinate size also correct nasal septal deformity show effective improving nasal obstruction . While many study demonstrate improvement surgery , prior study assess outcome use non-validated questionnaire , primitive measure single-item rating scale . There validated , patient-based , outcome instrument ass nasal obstruction , valid , reliable , sensitive : Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation ( NOSE ) scale ( Stewart , Witsell , et al ) . This brief easy complete instrument valid measure patient 's perception nasal obstruction . A multi-center prospective study use NOSE scale show septoplasty alone result significant improvement nasal obstruction , septoplasty PRIT even large improvement nasal obstruction , although difference reach statistical significance sample size ( Stewart , Smith , et al ) . Nevertheless , turbinate reduction appear additive effect symptomatic improvement , clinical finding note surgeon many year . The technique inferior turbinectomy evolved time . Initially , partial even total resection inferior turbinate perform . However , total inferior turbinate resection find high rate several long-term complication , include excessive dryness ( rhinitis sicca ) , atrophic rhinitis , crust , bleeding , etc . ( Moore GF , Moore EJ ) , technique generally perform today . By extension , many surgeon concerned potential sequela partial inferior turbinectomy , even though large prospective series demonstrate excellent outcome minimal complication PRIT technique ( Fanous , Ophir , Grymer , Stewart/Smith ) . Several alternative technique turbinate volume reduction - involve full-thickness resection portion turbinate - report , seem effective single-modality series ( Nease , Bhattacharyya , Utley , Li ) . In fact , anecdotally many surgeon claim RFA effective PRIT . In addition , radiofrequency technique perform local anesthesia office setting , increase ease use . While RFA appeal perform local anesthesia , improved ease use must weigh potential low effectiveness , since tissue remove . There data direct comparative study , probably partly validate outcome tool available . Therefore , sufficient clinical equipoise exist randomize patient receive one two widely-accepted technique .</detailed_description>
