	<brief_title>Phase I Pediatric FMP2.1/AS02A Trial Mali</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , control , dose-escalation , phase I trial FMP2.1/AS02A malaria vaccine , use rabies vaccine control . This study link DMID protocol 07-0003 . The primary objective study evaluate safety reactogenicity FMP2.1/AS02A child naturally expose P. falciparum malaria infection . The secondary objective measure magnitude duration antibody response FMP2.1 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . One hundred healthy child age 1-6 year Bandiagara , Mali , randomize 1 3 possible group . Twenty subject enrol cohort 1 40 subject cohorts 2 3 . Children within cohort randomize 3:1 ratio receive 10 , 25 50 microgram FMP2.1 ( cohorts 1 , 2 3 , respectively ) adjuvanted proportionate volume AS02A , rabies vaccine . Thus total 75 child receive malaria vaccine 25 rabies vaccine . Immunizations give day 0 , 30 60 staggered fashion , first administration 25 50 microgram dose level FMP2.1 follow first administration 10 25 microgram dose level , respectively , 2-3 week . Solicited adverse event record day immunization day 1 , 2 , 3 7 immunization , unsolicited adverse event record 30 day immunization . Children follow 1 year last immunization . Sera collect anti-FMP2.1 antibody titer day immunization 14 day immunization well 3 , 6 , 9 12 month first immunization . Each child participate study 414 day , include screening period . The primary outcome measure include : occurrence solicit symptoms vaccination 7-day surveillance period ( day vaccination day 1 , 2 , 3 7 vaccination ) , occurrence unsolicited symptom vaccination 30-day surveillance period ( day vaccination 30 subsequent day ) ; occurrence serious adverse event throughout study period . The secondary outcome measure titer activity anti-FMP2.1 antibody time point serology sample analyze , measure ELISA .</detailed_description>

Confirmed suspect immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Confirmed suspect autoimmune disease . History allergic reaction anaphylaxis immunization vaccine component . History serious allergic reaction substance , require hospitalization emergent medical care . History allergy tetracycline , doxycycline , nickel Imidazole . History splenectomy . Laboratory evidence liver disease ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] great upper limit normal test laboratory = 49.6 U/L ) . Laboratory evidence renal disease ( serum creatinine great upper limit normal test laboratory = 0.5 mg/dL ( 44.2 micromol/L ) , trace protein blood urine dipstick test ) . Laboratory evidence hematologic disease ( absolute leukocyte count &lt; 5,300/mm^3 &gt; 15,300/mm^3 , absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 2,300 mm^3 , platelet count &lt; 133,000/mm^3 , hemoglobin &lt; 9.0 g/dL ) . Chronic skin condition could interfere vaccine site reactogenicity assessment . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within three month precede first study immunization plan administration study period . Simultaneous participation interventional clinical trial . Acute chronic pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic , renal neurological condition , severe malnutrition , clinical finding opinion Principal Investigator ( PI ) may increase risk participate study . Other condition opinion PI would jeopardize safety right participant trial would render participant unable comply protocol .</criteria>
