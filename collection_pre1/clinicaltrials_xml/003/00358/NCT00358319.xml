	<brief_summary>This Phase I study look combination Valproic Acid ( VPA ) Karenitecin treat patient metastatic malignant melanoma . We find dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) high dose ( maximum tolerate dose ) combination treatment acceptable side effect recommend Phase II dose level . There seven escalate dos Valproic acid one dose escalation step Karenitecin . Each patient shall receive one cycle Karenitecin alone ( cycle 1 day 1 - 5 ) follow dose Karenitecin give combination VPA ( cycle 2 day 1-7 ) . Patients receive oral VPA divide dose 5 day Karenitecin start 3rd day every 3 week ( treatment cycle ) . Treatment continue progression disease unacceptable level toxicity . After 2 cycle treatment first efficacy evaluation restaging disease . In absence disease progression continue safety tolerability , treatment may continue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial Valproic Acid Karenitecin Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment cycle every 3 week 17 study visit . During Phase I subject receive one cycle Karenitecin alone ( cycle 1 day 1-5 ) combination therapy VPA + Karenitecin ( cycle 2 day 1-7 ) follow oral VPA divide dose 5 day Karenitecin start third day ( day 3-7 ) every 3 week . After 2 cycle treatment first efficacy evaluation restaging disease . Dose escalation continue unacceptable dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) occur , dose escalation stop previous dose level explore . In dose level , participant undergo pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample determine blood level . The melanoma skin lesion also biopsied measure effect combination therapy . All patient enrol Phase II treat VPA Karenitecin use dose schedule determine MTD Phase I . In absence disease progression continue safety tolerability , treatment may continue consecutive 3 week cycle .</detailed_description>
