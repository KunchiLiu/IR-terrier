	<brief_summary>PTK787/ZK 222584 inhibitor VEGFR family tyrosine kinase . The primary objective study assess safety daily oral PTK787/ZK 222584 combination paclitaxel infuse every 21 day . Secondary objective include pharmacokinetic assessment impact PTK787/ZK 222584 paclitaxel metabolism evaluation tumor response investigational treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial PTK787/ZK 222584 Plus Paclitaxel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- We look high dose Paclitaxel give safely combination high safe dose Vatalanib . Therefore , people receive dose study drug . - Small group people enrol step trial . This first group give certain dose Paclitaxel Vatalanib . If manageable side effect , next small group people enrol receive high dos study drug . This increase dose continue study doctor find high dose drug give without cause severe unmanageable side effect . - In study , Vatalanib tablets take daily , paclitaxel give three-hour intravenous infusion every 21 day .</detailed_description>
