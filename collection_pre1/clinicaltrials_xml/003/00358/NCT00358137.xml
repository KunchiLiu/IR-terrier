	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare effectiveness aerobic exercise program versus strength train program alter RR interval blood pressure variability index autonomic nervous system regulation cardiovascular system . Subjects test rest response challenge . This study enroll healthy , young ( age 18-45 ) sedentary individual Columbia University Medical Center St. John 's University . At initial screen visit , potential participant screen exercise activity also undergo test aerobic capacity . Subjects eligible exercise regularly exceed American Heart Association standard average fitness ( VO2max â‰¤ 43 37 ml/kg/min men woman respectively ) . Exclusion criterion include current symptom affective disorder , psychosis , substance abuse , current usage psychotropic medication , medical condition affect autonomic nervous system cardiovascular system . Eligible participant randomly assign 12 week either aerobic conditioning program strength train program . At study entry , heart rate , respiratory rate , blood pressure measure ; ECG use measure heart activity . Questionnaires complete assess anger , tension , depression , fatigue . Participants aerobic condition program attend four 1-hour exercise session per week , focus increase cardiovascular fitness run form aerobic exercise . The strength training program also include four session per week , focus increase muscle endurance strength . At end 12-week program , participant begin 4-week period deconditioning , discontinue exercise . Evaluations repeat end 12-week program , end 4-week deconditioning period .</detailed_description>
