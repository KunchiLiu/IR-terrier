	<brief_summary>This long-term , randomize , multi-center , open-label study infliximab treatment adult moderate severe plaque-type psoriasis . This study long-term extension Study P04271 ( NCT00251641 ) ; Study P04271 Phase 3b , randomize , parallel-group , multicenter , open-label , 26-week study compare efficacy safety infliximab versus methotrexate treatment adult subject moderate severe plaque-type psoriasis . The objective study assess efficacy safety long-term maintenance therapy versus intermittent therapy 5 mg/kg infliximab moderate severe plaque-type psoriasis population . During interim safety evaluation trial , high incidence serious severe infusion reaction observe intermittent treatment arm , consist re-induction cycle ( maximum 4 infusion 0 , 2 , 6 14 week ) period treatment compare maintenance arm ( infusion every 8 week without interruption treatment ) . Consequently , sponsor terminate trial . The label update reflect new information relating use re-induction regimen infliximab .</brief_summary>
