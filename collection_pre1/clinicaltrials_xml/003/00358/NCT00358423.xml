	<brief_summary>This research do look effect experimental drug call pegaptanib ( also call Macugen ) treatment swell retina ( light sensitive tissue back eye ) occur cataract surgery . Swelling retina lead blurry vision . The treatment available condition eye drop decrease swell back eye , eye drop may decrease swell everyone . We want see pegaptanib decrease swell retina improve vision patient swell cataract surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Macugen Patients With Chronic , Post-Operative Cystoid Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While 1 % 2 % people follow cataract surgery develop visual acuity loss chronic post-surgical cystoid macular edema ( CME ) , represent approximately 20,000 individual U.S. year , many throughout world . No current drug surgical treatment effective management chronic post-surgical CME . Topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication , ketorolac drop 4 time day ( qid ) 3 month , show reduce extent fluorescein leakage angiography patient condition ; however , compliance difficult , case resolve follow treatment , drop approve indication , unknown treatment effect last beyond 3 6 month . The fluorescein angiographic finding effect ketorolac drop suggest condition result increase permeability inflammation might resolve therapy decrease abnormal vessel permeability . Recent study show vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) play major role vessel permeability . Pegaptanib ( Macugen ) FDA-approved drug wet AMD . Pegaptanib selective VEGF antagonist block effect VEGF ; therefore , pegaptanib may decrease vessel permeability possibly decrease CME . Pegaptanib show activity reduce retinal blood vessel leakage diabetic patient chronic macular edema ( Macugen Diabetic Retinopathy Study Group . A phase II randomize double-masked trial pegaptanib , anti-vascular endothelial growth factor aptamer , diabetic macular edema . Ophthalmology 2005 ; 112:1747-57 . ) , support hypothesis might effective cause chronic macular edema . We plan conduct pilot study effect pegaptanib ( 3 treatment pegaptanib give often every 6 week 12 week ) subject chronic post-surgical CME . If pegaptanib treatment show beneficial condition , additional study could perform prove long-term effectiveness patient chronic CME even prophylaxis patient know high risk develop CME follow ocular surgery .</detailed_description>
