	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study evaluate impact change didanosine effective anti-HIV regimen tenofovir virologic suppression . We hypothesize , patient maximal virologic suppression double class regimen ( include two NRTIs NNRTI PI , boost RTV ) , single drug substitution didanosine tenofovir represent viable strategy without negative impact virologic efficacy regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective - determine impact change part effective HAART regimen tenofovir maintenance virologic suppression HCV co-infected patient . Secondary objective - ass safety tolerability 12 week patient switch tenofovir . Research Method - This single arm observational study include 30 subject . Patients require HCV treatment assess patient receive didanosine clinically evaluate determine appropriate NRTI drug switch . Patients switch didanosine component regimen tenofovir eligible participate study follow period observation 4 week . All patient receive tenofovir one capsule , daily . The primary endpoint maintenance virologic suppression Baseline visit week 12 overall study group . Measures adherence HAART , safety , tolerability CD4 cell count also obtain study visit , constitute secondary study endpoint .</detailed_description>
