	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease genetic disease result deficiency enzyme acid beta-glucosidase , also know glucocerebrosidase . This enzyme need digest substrate ( lipid ) call glucosylceramide , less degree , glucosylsphingosine . In participant Gaucher disease , liver , spleen , bone marrow brain show increase lipid concentration , specifically cell derive monocyte/macrophage system . Eliglustat tartrate ( Genz-112638 ) oral drug may regulate Gaucher disease process decrease synthesis glucosylceramide . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics ( PK ) eliglustat tartrate , administer oral dose either 50 milligram ( mg ) twice daily ( BID ) 100 mg BID , men woman Gaucher disease Type 1 52 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Efficacy Safety Eliglustat Tartrate ( Genz-112638 ) Type 1 Gaucher Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist several phase : screening ( -28 -1 day ) , dose adjustment/treatment ( Day 1 [ treatment baseline ] Day 30 ) , initial steady-state treatment ( post-Day 30 Week 52 post-baseline ) , treatment interruption period ( Week 52 approximately Week 54 ) , long-term steady-state treatment ( approximately Week 54 study completion ) , safety follow-up ( 30 37 day participant withdraws completes study ) . The Primary Analysis Period baseline Week 52 . The Extension Period Week 52 study completion ( , participant withdrawal , study terminate , eliglustat tartrate becomes commercially available , applicable , specific regulatory requirement meet ) .</detailed_description>
