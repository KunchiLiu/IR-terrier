	<criteria>A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply . Inclusion criterion pertain subject cohort ( treatment observational ) unless otherwise state . The subject sign date write assent form ( age appropriate ) parent/guardian sign date write informed consent form prior initiation studyrelated activity , include discontinuation prohibit medication . Male female subject age 2 17 year ( 2nd birthday include 18th birthday ) , weigh ≤ 84.9kg ( male ) / ≤ 72.5 ( female ) BMI 5 85 % age , speak , read write English age appropriate and/or parent/guardian . NOTE : If subject within weight requirement close upper low limit screen investigator anticipates study subject 's weight change become outside weight requirement , subject exclude study . To eligible entry treatment group study , female subject eligible enter study : Not pregnant nursing Of nonchildbearing potential . Nonchildbearing potential define premenarcheal female yet enter puberty evidence lack breast development ( palpable glandular breast tissue ) ; female documentation ( medical report verification ) hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy . Of childbearing potential . These female subject must negative urine pregnancy test screen visit , agree consistent correct use one acceptable method birth control least commencement last normal period prior first dose study medication continue first normal period treatment Week 24 Followup visit , whichever long . The subject diagnosis eosinophilic esophagitis current evidence biopsy isolate eosinophilic esophagitis define : Peak esophageal eosinophil count ( high count eosinophil per HPF least one esophageal sit biopsied ) 20 eosinophil minimum one HPF 400X magnification histology esophageal biopsy distal midesophagus within two week commence study medication , determined central histopathologist . Inadequate response intolerant therapy eosinophilic esophagitis The individual investigator apply clinical judgment define whether clinical response therapy eosinophilic esophagitis inadequate . As guidance , inadequate response might consist persistence current recent prior therapy , symptom eosinophilic esophagitis eosinophilic esophagitisrelated pain stomach , chest throat ; regurgitation ; vomit ; pain difficulty associate drinking fluid nutritional supplement ; pain difficulty associate eat . An inadequate response might also consist persistent eosinophilic infiltration esophagus , presence absence eosinophilic esophagitisrelated symptom . Similarly , individual investigator apply clinical judgment define whether patient intolerant therapy . For guidance , intolerance therapy eosinophilic esophagitis may consist undesirable sideeffects longterm therapy ; sideeffects longterm therapy difficult manage ; mark noncompliance therapy rejection therapy individual patient , parent/guardian , opinion investigator interfere patient 's optimal disease management . The criterion use investigator define inadequate response intolerance therapy eosinophilic esophagitis collect CRF . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply . Exclusion criterion pertain subject cohort ( treatment observational ) unless otherwise state . Current evidence eosinophilic gastrointestinal enteropathy ( EGID ) , eosinophilic esophagitis . Evidence gastroesophageal reflux disease , cause esophagitis investigator 's opinion predominant cause subject 's esophageal eosinophilia investigator 's opinion allow . Current presence , history ( anytime past ) : hypereosinophilic syndrome , collagen vascular disease , vasculitis , allergic drug reaction cause peripheral eosinophilia , graftversus host disease chronic idiopathic inflammatory bowel disorder ( ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , chronic granulomatous disease ) . Current evidence , history celiac disease . Current evidence active H. pylorus infection . Abnormal 12lead ECG Screening clinically significant opinion investigator .
