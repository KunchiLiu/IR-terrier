	<brief_title>Noninvasive Skin Spectroscopy Diabetes Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 18 million people Type II diabetes , , estimate thirty-five percent unaware condition . This translate roughly 6.3 million undiagnosed case worldwide 2002 . Many diagnosis make year onset disease . This allow progression vascular lesion arise time uncontrolled glucose level . As result , microvascular retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy rise , well macrovascular complication : coronary heart disease , cerebral vascular accident . The prevalence trend diabetes underscore need effective widespread screening . Our fluorescence base system development noninvasively measure skin glycation end product know strongly correlate diabetes status complication . Since test would painless require patient fasting , significant obstacle screen compliance would mitigate . The system offer hope screen test sensitive specific invasive test currently use diabetes screen ( Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) Fasting Plasma Glucose ( FPG ) test ) .</detailed_description>
