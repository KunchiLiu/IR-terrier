	<detailed_description>Background . The prevalence individual 65 year age 6 % ( 95 % Confidence Interval [ CI ] 5 - 6 ) ( 1-4 ) men 1 % ( 95 % CI 1 – 2 ) woman . ( 5 ) AAA confers risk spontaneous rupture death : in-hospital mortality rate rupture aneurysm Ontario estimate 40.8 % . ( 6 ) Prevention spontaneous rupture rationale surgical intervention . Evidence establish elective open surgery AAAs &gt; 5.5cm increase survival ( 7 ) , 30-day perioperative mortality elective open repair AAA high 8 % . ( 8-17 ) Phase I II trial find endovascular repair ‘ viable effective treatment ’ AAA disease ( 18 ; 19 ) ; theoretical benefit include avoidance laparotomy aortic clamping . The result RCTs ( DREAM EVAR-1 ) ( 20 ; 21 ) leave unanswered indication endovascular repair compare open surgery problem definition outcome , lack statistical power , surgical expertise ( surgeon need do least 20 surgery without supervision ) . The study address issue expertise field suggest 60 EVAR need do achieve less 10 % complication ( 22 ) , time interval le 10 day procedure important maintain competence reduce complication . ( 23 ) In addition two RCTs use conventional design report intrinsic pitfall . We argue surgery , particularly new technique study , another approach use : expertise base RCT . ( 24 ) Conventional RCTs typically randomize participant one two intervention ( A B ) clinician give intervention A participant B others . The expertise base randomize controlled trial , randomize participant clinician expertise intervention A clinician expertise intervention B , clinicians perform procedure expertise . Study Design/Participants We conduct expertise base RCT compare open repair EVAR repair elective infrarenal AAAs . This pilot determine feasibility large pragmatic expertise base RCT open versus EVAR repair . We consider patient AAA determine require non-urgent repair assessment one participate surgeon . The second inclusion criterion blind measurement team must deem patient fulfill anatomic eligibility criterion . Location Investigation This pilot study conduct single institution : Hamilton Health Sciences , Hamilton General Hospital . This centre serve coordinate site future multicentre randomize controlled trial , base high volume practice surgeon Hamilton General Hospital , likely provide large pool eligible patient . Protocols standard operating procedure single site develop pilot , become standard large trial . The decision use single centre pilot study base high expect surgical volume make recruitment rate realistic , addition cost saving conduct trial close investigator surround known infrastructure . Patient Recruitment Once patient deem eligible , study nurse provide patient detail study protocol explanation goal investigation , obtain informed consent . Randomization Allocation The study nurse contact surgeon ’ office screen patient refer participate vascular surgeon first visit office submit standardize electronic form accessible secure , encrypt website . This document baseline demographic refer patient include key eligibility criterion . If meet , study nurse contact patient , explain study , determine remain eligibility criterion obtain consent . The nurse use electronic database randomly allocate patient open endovascular repair . We ensure concealment allocation use randomization allocation process house encrypt website monitor data coordinator external study protocol . This process successfully develop within St Joseph 's Nephrology , Thromboembolism Vascular research group . Randomization use random-sized permuted block technique ensure balanced distribution patient concealment allocation . Once allocation occur , study nurse coordinate patient appointment appropriate surgeon . Patients meet eligibility requirement return original surgeon disclosure result treatment . Patient Follow-up The study nurse meet patient , document baseline characteristic perform blood work preoperative clinic visit . The study nurse see patient daily surgery , arrange daily blood work document outcome event use standardized case report form discharge hospital . An outcome assessor committee independent study blind treatment allocation adjudicate outcome event . The study nurse see patient 3-month interval 6 month . The use 6-month outcome threshold purpose assess feasibility pilot study . The large multicentre trial plan evaluate outcome five year , address long term concern raise RCTs . Evaluation Pilot Objectives We consider pilot study success : 1 . Recruit 30 patient 40 week 2 . Obtain complete follow-up 95 % trial patient 3 . Demonstrate feasibility use web-based system randomize follow patient trial , outcome adjudication , 4 . Document resource ( e.g. , personnel time ) require conduct trial .

Any aneurysm extends proximal renal artery ( suprarenal ) , involve renal artery less 15mm distal level low renal artery . 3 . Exclusion due Operative Factors : Patients multiple previous laparotomy make open repair contraindicate due adhesion ( ‘ hostile abdomen ’ ) . Any patient stomas exteriorize bowel . Patients previous abdominal radiation , FitzHughCurtis , history condition would render open operative intervention contraindicate .</criteria>
