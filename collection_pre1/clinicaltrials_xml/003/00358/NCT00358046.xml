	<brief_summary>This randomize , dose-ranging , efficacy tolerability study chronic kidney disease patient hyperphosphatemia hemodialysis . Patient participation study approximately 10 week duration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Tolerability ILY101 Dialysis Patients With Hyperphosphatemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hyperphosphatemia associate abnormally high blood concentration phosphorus . Normally , phosphorus body excreted urine via kidney , process impair renal function reduce . Hyperphosphatemia occur many patient renal insufficiency , especially dialysis . High blood phosphorus concentration trigger various complication cause phosphorous interaction blood calcium parathyroid hormone , make patient prone calcium deposition soft tissue coronary artery , increase risk ischemic heart disease . ILY101 non-absorbed , metal-free polymer bind phosphorus gastrointestinal tract , allow excretion phosphorus . It therefore anticipate ameliorate hyperphosphatemia reduce absorption phosphorus gastrointestinal tract .</detailed_description>
