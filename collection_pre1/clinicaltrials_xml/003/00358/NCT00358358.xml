Symptoms COPD include breathlessness , cough , wheeze . COPD vary enormously patient patient . The effect drug treatment usually measure conduct lung function test ( breathe test ) use machine call spirometer always provide complete picture well COPD respond . In study therefore want look new sensitive way measure COPD . The result research help assessment new drug COPD future .</brief_summary>
