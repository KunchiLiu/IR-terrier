	<brief_title>The Use Oral Appliances Adjunct Continuous Positive Airway Pressure ( CPAP ) Treatment Obstructive Sleep Apnoea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each patient undergo detailed history physical examination particular attention symptom related sleep disorder , cardiovascular disease , medication , motor vehicle accident , occupation change symptom . Weight , height neck circumference measure BMI calculate compare previous measurement record medical chart . The research question explore whether oral appliance approach well term successful treatment , compliance treatment , safety quality life compare conventional CPAP therapy OSAHS . It cross design . Consecutive patient - meet eligibility criterion - agree trial therapy oral appliance - give informed consent recruit . Inclusion criterion - stable C-PAP least 3 month , Previous diagnostic polysomnography within 2 year , Pre-treatment AHI 10-30 ( mild-moderate sleep apnea ) , Compliance &gt; 4hrs per night , Are willing able give inform consent Exclusion Criteria - AHI &gt; 30 , Oxygen Saturation &lt; 85 % &gt; 10 % study time previous diagnostic PSG , Or le 8 teeth per jaw Or enough teeth good periodontal health allow retention appliance , Operates heavy machinery motor vehicle part job , Clinical evidence severe tempero-mandibular joint dysfunction , Previous Motor Vehicle Crash assoc . sleepiness , Major cardiovascular morbidity , Medically complicate medically unstable . Thirty patient recruit period 1 year . Prior treatment baseline ESS SAQLI record . Physical attribute record BMI neck circumference unchanged pre-treatment record PSG deem unnecessary point . Baseline RDI , snore index treatment , record use portable snoresat monitoring . All patient visit dental clinic fitting adjustment Klearway appliance . The appliance advance supervision clinic patient assessed interval 2-4 week . Titration assess clinically base patient sleepiness , snore , comfort , maximal jaw adjustment . Snoresat monitoring repeat wear appliance optimal position ensure adequate titration . Once titration complete patient ask wear appliance exclusively period least 7 day . Full PSG record 7 day use appliance . ESS measure time PSG . Treatment efficacy point determine safety continue use appliance . Treatment failure define ESS &gt; 4 baseline AHI &gt; 20 &gt; 50 % pre-treatment baseline . Patients see reassess informed sleep study result . Patients able use appliance safely ask continue use OSA treatment individually allow decide mode therapy use night . Patients keep daily diary recording use treatment modality , length time worn also location ( home , vacation etc ) . At end study patient see diary collect . Satisfaction level assess side effect record . Objective CPAP compliance analyse download CPAP machine . Future treatment preference term either treatment combination record .</detailed_description>
