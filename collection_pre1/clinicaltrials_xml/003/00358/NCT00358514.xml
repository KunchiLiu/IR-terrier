	<brief_summary>This study design allow u learn diagnose Compartment Syndrome , condition occur approximately 5 % tibial ( low leg ) fracture . In Compartment Syndrome , nerve , muscle blood vessel affect swell within enclose space ( compartment ) leg . The tissue cover compartment ( call fascia ) expandable able accommodate swelling , tissue within compartment become compress . If pressure relieve result blood flow block inside compartment ( muscle , blood vessel , nerve ) lead permanent injury muscle nerve . Late complication untreated compartment syndrome include failure injured bone heal , nerve damage , contracture ( shorten ) muscle , result weak , painful , stiff , poorly form limb function well , could result amputation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design prospectively evaluate clinical result use Continuous Compartment Pressure Monitoring ( CCPM ) treatment tibial fracture . Fractures tibia cause local haemorrhage , tissue edema swell within indistensible fascial compartment leg . In proportion patient , pressure within compartment rise sufficiently high reduce capillary bed perfusion , result tissue ischemia . This condition term compartment syndrome complicates approximately 5 % tibial fracture . The early late morbidity untreated compartment syndrome important . In early period , severe pain , local muscle necrosis infection may occur , systemically , rhabdomyolysis may result renal failure . Multiple surgical procedure prolong period hospital treatment may require address complication . Ultimately affected limb may loose viability require amputation . Later , non-union bone , contracture muscle permanent nerve palsy may result limb painful , deform , weak stiff dystrophic vulnerable skin . This may result functional impairment , loss employment , amputation . The treatment compartment syndrome emergency fasciotomy four leg compartment universally accept . However , small significant level morbidity associate procedure . Local cutaneous nerve may inadvertently divide , open wound may become infected , stag closure wound may require several operative procedure general anaesthetic . The result scar cosmetically prominent unsightly , may hypersensitive fragile . The diagnosis compartment syndrome may problematic . The clinical feature well described , individual patient may equivocal , atypical , mask analgesia obtund consciousness . Although case acute compartment syndrome rarely miss altogether contemporary practice , diagnosis delay many hour uncertainty lack awareness importance subtle evolve clinical picture . This delay diagnosis expose patient prolonged compartmental ischemia increase risk complication .</detailed_description>
