	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES The primary objective study determine relative effectiveness azithromycin doxycycline eradicate Mycoplasma genitalium Ureaplasmas among men nongonococcal urethritis ( NGU ) . Secondary objective study : - determine sensitivity persist organism azithromycin doxycycline perform minimum inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) test - determine relationship persistence/recurrence clinical sign persistent/recurrent detection M. genitalium Ureaplasmas among men NGU treat azithromycin doxycycline , measure follow-up clinical exam repeat assay perform specimen collect follow-up study visit STUDY DESCRIPTION 1200 men NGU , age 16 older , enrol randomized double-blinded treatment trial . Urine sample , oral swab , urethral swab obtain subject initial clinic visit . Urine specimens test M. genitalium Ureaplasma . Study participant randomly assign receive one two pre-packaged treatment : active doxycycline plus placebo azithromycin active azithromycin plus placebo doxycycline . Subjects complete questionnaire , give simple standardized log ask keep track adherence study drug , record solicit adverse event , note symptom disappear and/or reappear , document sexual activity study visit . Subjects test positive M. genitalium Ureaplasmas initial clinic visit ask return least two follow-up study visit : approximately 3 6 week follow initial clinic visit . During follow-up visit , participant answer follow-up questionnaire re-evaluated sign urethritis re-tested M. genitalium Ureaplasmas . Study participant sign and/or symptom urethritis test positive M. genitalium Ureaplasmas follow-up study visit receive blind treatment packet contain alternate medication , offer open-label moxifloxacin alternate treatment regimen administer prior follow-up study visit .
