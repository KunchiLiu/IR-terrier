	<brief_title>Follow-Up VLBW Infants With Chronic Lung Disease : Respiratory Health Neurodevelopment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The introduction antenatal steroid use , postnatal surfactant administration modern respiratory care past decade markedly improve survival small preterm infant . However , offset increase incidence chronic lung disease CLD ) define oxygen requirement 36 week post-conceptional age . Although previous study show preterm infant resolve neonatal respiratory disease likely exhibit respiratory illness , developmental disorder , impaired growth cognitive limitation compare without , information concern longitudinal respiratory neurodevelopmental outcome recently survive preterm infant CLD limit . Therefore , prospective three-year two-centered study continue follow respiratory health neurodevelopment 73 low birth weight ( VLBW ) preterm infant preschool age . This cohort consist 44 infant CLD 29 demographically matched infant without CLD enrol National Taiwan University Hospital MacKay Memorial Hospital . Those infant comprehensively examine respiratory function neurodevelopmental performance neonatal infant period . Twenty five age-matched full-term infant additional include serve normal reference group . The purpose study threefold . First , VLBW infants CLD , VLBW infant without CLD full-term infant examine respiratory health use pulmonary function exercise test 3-5 year old assessed relation early respiratory environmental variable later respiratory outcome . Secondly , infant examine neurodevelopmental outcome use Bayley Scales Infant Development- 2nd edition , Developmental Test Visual Motor Integration , Peabody Developmental Motor Scale- 2nd edition , Child Behavior Check List , Weschler Preschooler Intelligence Scale clinical diagnosis pediatric neurologist pediatric psychiatrist , assess relation early neuromotor environmental variable later neurodevelopmental outcome . Thirdly , VLBW infant assess concurrent consecutive longitudinal relationship respiratory neurodevelopmental measure . The result study help understand nature change respiratory health neurodevelopment VLBW infant CLD birth preschool age . The identified influencing factor adverse respiratory neurodevelopmental outcome assist health professional design treatment strategy improve outcome . Furthermore , obtain database help develop national monitoring system measure effect respiratory management early intervention program preterm infant neonatal respiratory disease .</detailed_description>
