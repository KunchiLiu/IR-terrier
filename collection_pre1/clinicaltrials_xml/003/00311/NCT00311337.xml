	<detailed_description>Protocol DSMM VIII multi-center , open-label study evaluate safety tolerability , well efficacy , maintenance treatment VELCADE patient multiple myeloma detectable disease activity follow tandem high-dose chemotherapy autologous SCT . The time SCT initiation VELCADE treatment 3 6 month . The initial 11 patient enter trial treat dose level 1.0 mg/m2 weekly 4 consecutive week follow 2 week rest . A total 4 treatment cycle plan . An interim analysis safety tolerability perform least first cycle study drug complete . If study treatment find safe dose-limiting toxicity occur , dose VELCADE increase 1.3 mg/m2 another 11 patient treat dose level accord treatment schedule outline . The dose escalation 1.3 mg/m2 perform without delay AE SAE report principal investigator . If safety specific dose level acceptable efficacy maintenance treatment statistically evaluate . The treatment consider efficacious minimum 25 % treated patient experience success , consider remission disease within 6 month end VELCADE treatment . The therapy acceptable clinical study minium 25 % successfully treated patient observe . Under assumption first step optimal two step design ( Simon 1989 ) 21 patient treat . As patient include phase I include efficacy analysis , mean additional 10 patient treat . If less three patient successfully treat defined improvement remission status , study stop , success rate unacceptably low . If three 21 patient successfully treat , another 29 patient include . At end study success rate evaluate . If 8 50 patient successfully treat therapy acceptable study . Patients evaluate scheduled screening baseline visit . After provide write informed consent participate study , patient screen study eligibility screen period 28 day . Baseline assessment consist detailed history pre-existing disease , blood test include disease-specific marker ÃŸ2-microglobulin , IgG , IgA , IgM , immunofixation blood urine , serum free light chain , bone marrow biopsy , skeletal survey , electrocardiogram chest X-ray . The study drug administer study center . Prior administration study drug , short medical history focus VELCADE-associated side effect perform well complete blood cell count , kidney liver function test . A visit day 30 follow last administration study drug final assessment safety tolerability mandatory patient include protocol . Serological myeloma specific marker ( monoclonal immunoglobulin , serum free light chain immunofixation blood urine ) perform week 6 , 12 , 18 24 thereafter 3 month interval . Bone marrow biopsy perform serological marker indicate complete remission progression , skeletal survey year follow-up . During study , disease assess accord EBMT/IBMTR/ABMTR criterion . Safety evaluate occurrence clinical laboratory toxicity change baseline physical examination finding , vital sign , , applicable , chest X-ray electrocardiogram finding . All patient receive aminobisphosphonate 4 weekly interval . Other disease-modifying treatment alpha interferon pulse corticosteroid strictly prohibit .</detailed_description>
