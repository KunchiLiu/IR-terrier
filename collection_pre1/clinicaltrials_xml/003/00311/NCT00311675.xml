	<detailed_description>The purpose open-label , phase I/II study investigate safety immunogenicity two 90-mcg dos intramuscular inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine healthy adult , age 18 year old . Subjects receive 2 dos vaccine separate approximately 28 day . Subjects maintain memory aid record oral temperature systemic local adverse event ( AEs ) 7 day immunization . Subjects contact telephone 1 3 day vaccination ( approximately Day 2 ) ass concomitant medication occurrence AEs , return clinic Day 7 AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination ( indicate ) , review memory aid . Serum immunogenicity evaluation obtain prior first vaccination ( Day 0 ) prior second vaccination ( Day 28 ) , Days 56 180 . Primary objective determine safety subvirion inactivate A/H5N1 vaccine healthy adult determine immunogenicity subvirion inactivate H5N1 vaccine healthy adult approximately 1 month follow receipt two 90 mcg dos vaccine . The secondary objective evaluate immunogenicity percent subject respond approximately 1 7 month first vaccination . Primary endpoint : AE serious adverse event information ( solicit in-clinic via memory aid , concomitant medication , periodic targeted physical assessment ) ; geometric mean titer ( GMT ) frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ; GMT frequency 4-fold great increase serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine . The secondary endpoint GMT frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer group 1 month 7 month receipt first dose vaccine ; GMT frequency 4-fold great increase serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer group 1 month 7 month receipt first dose vaccine ; development serum antibody responses antigenically drifted variant H5N1 influenza virus .</detailed_description>
