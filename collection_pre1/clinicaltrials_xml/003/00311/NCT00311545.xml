	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , CNTO 328 , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well CNTO 328 work treat patient unresectable metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0351 , CNTO 328 Treating Patients With Unresectable Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess probability response ( confirmed complete partial response ) patient unresectable metastatic renal cell cancer treat CNTO 328 . Secondary - Assess 6-month progression-free survival probability median overall survival patient . - Evaluate qualitative quantitative toxicity treatment . - Investigate , preliminary manner , association tumor response potential marker anti-interleukin-6 activity . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive CNTO 328 IV 2 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete partial response 6 course therapy may receive additional 6 course . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
