	<brief_summary>This study look safety , tolerability body CS-8958 give 40 healthy volunteer 18-55 year old . CS-8958 dry-powder investigational drug breathe lung inhaler device . The researcher collect information problem volunteer take drug change blood pressure heart work . Volunteers breathe test , physical examination , blood sample collect laboratory test . The researcher also look much medication travel throughout body versus much stay lung . Doses medication test one level high high level safety committee review safety tolerability information volunteer prior next high dose give . Each volunteer participate 6 week initial screen follow visit spend 7 day clinic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study phase I , double-blind , placebo-controlled , ascend single inhale dose , safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic study CS-8958 healthy subject . CS-8958 investigational drug substance , formulate dry-powder . Capsules dry powder insert FlowCaps® inhaler device . FlowCaps® re-fillable , dry-powder , breath-actuated inhaler device , hold 14 capsule . Upon actuation powder contain one capsule deliver respiratory tract . The primary study objective evaluate safety tolerability CS-8958 ( 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 mg ) healthy subject single dose administer via inhalation . Parameters adverse event ( AEs ) , vital sign include blood pressure/pulse rate ( BP/PR ) measurement , functional oxygen saturation arterial haemoglobin ( SpO2 ) , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) examination , spirometry ( Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) , Forced Expiratory Volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , FEV percentage 1 second ( FEV 1 % ) , FEV1/FVC ratio , Forced Expiratory Flow Rate ( FEF ) 25 % -75 % , Peak Expiratory Flow Rate ( PEFR ) , physical examination , mood assessment , laboratory parameter . The secondary study objective ass systemic exposure CS-8958 active metabolite R-125489 single inhaled dos CS-8958 healthy subject . At Covance Clinical Research Unit Ltd , Leeds , UK , 40 subject study 4 group ( Groups A D ) group consist 10 subject . Healthy male female subject age 18-55 year inclusive recruit study . There four investigational product treatment group ( Groups A , B , C , D ) . Within group , subject randomly allocate Arm 1 Arm 2 . The study product dos administer escalate manner . The Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) review safety tolerability data group , prior administration next dose . Following review , dose increment subsequent group may increase , dos administer may reduce , may lower start dose . The maximum dose level study 40 mg . The primary outcome measure include safety tolerability . These outcome measure address term occurrence treatment-emergent AEs , change vital sign include BP PR , SpO2 , oral body temperature , ECG , spirometry ( FVC , FEV1 , FEV 1 % , FEV1/FVC ratio , FEF 25-75 % PEFR ) , physical examination , mood assessment , laboratory parameter . Secondary outcome measure include pharmacokinetic parameter . These parameter calculate CS-8958 R-125489 concentration plasma urine use non-compartmental approach .</detailed_description>
