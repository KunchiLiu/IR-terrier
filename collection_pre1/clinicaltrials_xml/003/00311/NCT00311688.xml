	<detailed_description>IL-2 biological response modifier improve body 's response disease . It hop IL-2 treatment help restore CD4 cell count immune function people whose immune system damage HIV . Over last 10 year , NIAID sponsor number important study IL-2 HIV infected people ; many trial ongoing . This study develop effort consolidate separate , small trial one large study result trial share use develop future protocol . This study umbrella study provide long-term administrative support , treatment , monitor ongoing Phase I II IL-2 trial participant . It primarily intend patient extension phase previous NIAID Clinical Center HIV Program ( NIAID/CCMD ) intramural research protocols IL-2 therapy continue offer . Blood collection occur patient 's participation study . Participants continue follow protocol originally enrol . A desired therapeutic goal `` CD4 plateau '' use case help clinician determine participant require additional IL-2 . In general , participant two consecutive CD4 count CD4 plateau , additional IL-2 administer patient . In maintain uniformity among many trial consolidate trial , frequency nature study visit solely dictate umbrella study . Participants also ask join optional substudy : Interrupted Versus Continuous Antiretrovirals Involving Randomization Umbrella Study ( ICARUS ) .</detailed_description>
