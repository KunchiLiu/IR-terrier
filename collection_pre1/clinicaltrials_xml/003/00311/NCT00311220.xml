	<brief_summary>Tuberculosis still common infectious disease Taiwan . The infant Taiwan vaccinate birth BCG -Tokyo 171 strain since 1951 . The BCG vaccination rate 97 % among first grade student recent national survey . Even high BCG vaccination coverage , Taiwan still relatively high TB incidence rate . In 2004 , totally 16,784 newly diagnose TB case annual incidence 74.11 per 100,000 population nationally . Nearly 70 % incidence case men 30.4 % woman . The mean age incidence case 57.8 year old ( median=63 ) . 8,440 ( 50.29 % ) patient elderly 65 year old . The elderly men receive BCG vaccination important group develop newly diagnose tuberculosis special issue national TB control program Taiwan . The tuberculin skin test ( TST ) widely available method detect whether people immunologic reactivity mycobacterial antigen identify latent tuberculosis infection ( LTBI ) . Targeted tuberculin test latent TB infection important strategy identify subject high risk develop tuberculosis include recent infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical condition associate increase risk progression LTBI active TB sensitivity low elderly patient . Quantiferon-TB gold test ( QFT-RD1 ) new diagnostic test latent tuberculosis valuable alternative skin test . This whole-blood assay measure production IFN-  whole blood upon stimulation ESAT-6 CFP-10 allow distinction latent M. tuberculosis infection BCG-induced reactivity . ESAT-6 CFP-10 delete BCG Region 1 ( RD1 ) , present nontuberculous mycobacteria highly specific indicator M. tuberculosis infection . Thus , aim study estimate specificity sensitivity whole blood IFN-γassay employ CFP-10 ESAT-6 , detection M. tuberculosis infection cluster high risk elderly population . Changhwa Veterans Home government-expense veteran home totally 519 resident 2004.The inhabitant elderly people live group . , They receive BCG vaccination high risk group develop endemic TB infection . The annual TB incidence rate 3,500 per 100,000 population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use TST QFT-RD1 Test Monitor Tuberculous Infection Patients , Close Contact People Health Care Workers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY POPULATION AND METHODS Population The study population represent individual screen TB 6-month period end December 2004 part number community health outreach program base Center Disease Control Taichung , Taiwan . Changhwa Veterans Home government-expense veteran home totally 519 resident 2004 . Only individual properly read TST sign informed consent include study population . If TST positive , evaluation TB advise . Anyone find active TB infection ( 12 individual diagnose , household contact ) appropriately treat also include study . No general population low-risk control include study population . There entry exclusion study . Before TST administer , short interview include verbal consent BCG scar count evaluation conduct experienced nurse . The TST contain 2 tuberculin unit ( TU ) RT23 tuberculin Tween 80 ( 0.2 ml 1TU/0.1 ml ) give intradermally left forearm volar surface Mantoux technique . Validity measure inter-observer performance do TST placement interpretation individually two experienced nurse . A purified protein derivative-Siebert ( PPD-S ) dose 5TU roughly equivalent 2TU RT23 . 2TU International Union Against Tuberculosis Lung Disease recommend dose RT23 TST . TST also perform BCG-vaccinated health care worker . After 48–72 h injection , TST site evaluate induration transverse measurement record . Any reading make outside time period exclude study . All unvaccinated subject blood draw QFT-RD1 time apply first TST . A TST reaction size ≧10 mm interpret ‘ positive ’ TST guide medical evaluation . This traditional cutoff point use RT23 tuberculin Taiwan well study worldwide . If initial TST diameter le 10 mm , second TST repeat within 1-5 week observe ‘ boosting phenomenon ’ possible . Statistical analysis skin test result population characteristic do cut-off point , exception one analysis specifically do at≧18 mm BCG-vaccinated health care worker . Household contact active TB patient presumably high risk TB infection ; group label ‘ household contact ’ . No active TB case report among resident year .</detailed_description>
