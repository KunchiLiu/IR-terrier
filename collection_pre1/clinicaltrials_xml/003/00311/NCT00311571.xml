	<brief_summary>Microgravity space flight induces physiological change affect astronauts ’ health performance . Space flight simulation prolong bed rest mimic change provide study condition accessible space flight . The European Space Agency , ESA together French national space agency , CNES Japanese national space agency , NASDA perform extensive study use long duration bed rest . Previous study include several long short term bed rest campaign yield significant medical data physiological change induce space flight . These data use study effect countermeasure , method help prevent physiological change . The long duration bed rest , last 3 month undertakes variety investigation involve 28 subject . This study focus countermeasure , study effect bone tissue stabilisation medication resistive exercise determine suitability use long duration stay ISS . The physiological change record space flight bed rest mimic observe disease age process . Significant clinical application expect direct result experiment future equivalent study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The spaceflight undertaken date demonstrate Man adapt condition exist space , particularly weightlessness . However , space environment prevail micro-gravity induce modification may affect performance astronauts . These modification concern particular cardiovascular hormonal system , muscle , bone , blood immune system . Other problem may occur long duration flight , problem create psychological stress due confinement , result cosmic ray ( radiation ) . In view fact space flight opportunity , experience simulate effect weightlessness experience undertaken earth , order well understand adaptation mechanism , prepare spaceflight , perfect evaluate corrective method ( call counter-measures ) physical exercise medication , facilitate astronaut ’ return base . These experiment also necessity , view difficulty encounter carry certain experience flight , due presence astronaut board , lack advance biomedical device onboard ( scanner , etc. ) . The common simulation anti-orthostatic bed rest ( tilt position head slightly foot –6° angle ) . Since current objective simulate flight International Space Station ( 3 6 month ) possible flight Mars ( 500 1000 day ) , mandatory extend duration simulation experiment . This three Space Agencies , CNES ( France ) , European Space Agency ( ESA , European Union ) , National Space Development Agency Japan ( NASDA , Japan ) decide join force undertake common simulation campaign ground , best apprehend adaptation process constraint space environment . The 2 main objective experiment : - study physiological change mechanisms ground-based experiment simulate long duration spaceflight , - develop validate preventive method ( countermeasure ) use standard test . This test present study effect orthostatic bed rest ( decubitus ) 90 day ( 3 month ) follow physiological system : - bone , - muscle , - cardiovascular system control mechanism , - sleep , - spine . In absence gravity , weight astronaut object disappear completely . This induce modification bone muscle severely affect astronaut ’ life flight , even return earth . This fundamental point study , since may become limit factor even obstacle long duration flight . This experiment also permit test physical exercise program drug , pamidronate ( AREDIA® ) , counter-measures effect weightlessness locomotion system ( skeleton muscle ) . A total 28 volunteer participate experiment , split three group . Said experiment spread 2 year , 14 volunteer participate time . The 3 group follow : - Group “ physical exercise ” ( 9 volunteer ) , - Group “ drug ” ( pamidronate ) ( 9 volunteer ) , - Group “ control ” ( 10 volunteer ) . Members group draw lot among participant - Group “ Exercise ” : exposure Man microgravity result muscular atrophy affect muscle lumbar region lower limb concerned stand position locomotion . During certain flight , physical exercise program implement , order fight muscular atrophy , maintain physical condition require mission prepare astronauts return earth . In course present experiment , physical exercise program test 9 volunteer group ( resistance training use calf knee extensor muscle special devicecalled Fly-Wheel ) . - Group “ Drug ” : Man microgravity sole experimental model available test rapid occurrence osteoporosis healthy subject . Osteoporosis , porous bone , appear whenever rate bone material replace fall resorption , thus create bone fragility increase risk fracture ( hip , spine wrist essentially ) . It appear generally menopause , associate age lack physical activity . The pamidronate ( Aredia® ) drug present market since many year , use treatment several bone pathology . This drug test 9 volunteer group , demonstrate efficiency treat bone modification . This drug ( 60mg ) infuse intravenously 14 day bed rest . - Group “ control ” : group serve reference experimentation . Volunteers group without physical exercise without drug . The existence group necessary able compare result 2 type counter-measures . The experience carry 120 day stay ( total 4 month ) Space Clinic comprise : - 1 control ambulatory period 15 day ( subject report day ) ( -15 –1 ) , - 1 anti-orthostatic ( -6° ) bed rest period 90 day ( 1 90 ) , - 1 recovery ambulatory period 15 day ( subject depart follow morning ) ( +1 +15 ) , represent total 122 night spend clinic volunteer . The assessment do different European Japanese scientific team , one specialising specific domain . None 3 group volunteer submit experimentation program .</detailed_description>
