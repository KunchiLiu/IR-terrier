	<brief_title>A Phase IIIB Dose Comparison Study Subcutaneous Hydration With Without Human Recombinant Hyaluronidase ( HYLENEX ) Volunteer Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two sequential stage : Stage 1 : Preliminary assessment mean flow rate inter-subject variability , comparison IV infusion . Each subject receive SC infusion 400 mL ( 0.5 L bag ) Ringer ’ lactate solution upper arm , follow one IV infusion 400 mL Ringer ’ lactate solution ( 0.5 L bag ) . The SC injection site randomize double-blinded fashion receive either 150 unit Hylenex equal volume saline placebo inject Y-port tube catheter immediately prior infusion . 24-gauge angiocatheters place symmetrically SC space proximal upper extremities lateral aspect , midline halfway olecranon process inferoposterior aspect acromion , introduce 30-degree angle . A 24-gauge angiocatheter also place vein either leave right forearm ( per randomization ) . In upper arm , Ringer ’ lactate solution infuse SC gravity ( wide open ) place top fluid 0.5 liter bag height 100 cm respective angiocatheter site . After completion SC infusion , Ringer ’ lactate solution infuse IV gravity ( wide open ) place top fluid 0.5 liter bag height 100 cm angiocatheter site . The flow rate observation Stage 1 use either confirm adjust propose sample size Stage 2 , adjustment necessary . Stage 2 : Dose-comparison assessment rate flow range 150 1,500 unit Hylenex . Each subject receive SC infusion 400 mL ( 0.5 L bag ) Ringer ’ lactate solution upper arm . The SC injection site randomize double-blinded fashion either Hylenex equal volume saline solution inject Y-port tube catheter immediately prior infusion . 24-gauge angiocatheters place symmetrically SC space proximal upper extremities lateral aspect , midline halfway olecranon process inferoposterior aspect acromion , introduce 30-degree angle . In arm , Ringer ’ lactate solution infuse SC gravity ( wide open ) place top fluid 0.5 liter bag height 100 cm respective catheter site . Subjects dose either two three sequential cohort . Cohort 3 , 750 U , conduct ONLY flow rate Cohort 2 least 20 % fast Cohort 1 without unacceptable toxicity Cohort 1 , unacceptable toxicity observe Cohort 2 Cohort In stage , safety tolerability assess physical examination target infusion site volume status assessment , vital sign , adverse event . Study Medications Hylenex recombinant ( hyaluronidase human injection ) ; rHuPH20 ( Hylenex register trademark Baxter International , Inc. subsidiaries ) Duration : In stage study , subject successfully screen study receive single , one-day session study drug administration follow parenteral infusion , undergo follow-up evaluation 1 day ( clinic ) 28 day ( telephone ) treatment . Subject Population : Normal volunteer satisfy entry criterion . Planned Total Sample Size : Considering stage , total 70 subject may enrol study . Stage 1 : Five evaluable subject enrol . It anticipate total 10 subject need enrol provide 5 evaluable subject . An evaluable subject one complete 3 parenteral infusion . Subjects meet criterion , include withdrawn prematurely reason toxicity , replace . Stage 2 : 15 evaluable subject per cohort enrol . An evaluable subject one complete SC infusion complete protocol-specified assessment sufficient determination safety tolerability . Subjects meet criterion , include withdrawn prematurely reason toxicity , replace . Enrollment Cohort 3 dependent finding Cohorts 1 2 . Allowing non-evaluable subject three cohort , include 15 evaluable subject , total 60 subject may enter Stage 2 . Stopping Rules : Safety monitoring enrolled subject ongoing continuous . If sign symptom unacceptable fluid overload occur , subject withdrawn .</detailed_description>
