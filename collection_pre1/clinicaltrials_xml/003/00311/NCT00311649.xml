	<brief_summary>The purpose research study side effect safety new H5N1 flu ( bird flu ) vaccine look well people 's immune system make antibody fight infection get vaccine . Up 300 healthy people work Aventis Pasteur H5N1 virus vaccine production facility Swiftwater , PA , flu season ask participate . It important vaccine production worker receive vaccine order minimize risk bird flu virus combine regular flu virus . Volunteers study medical screening , 2 vaccination month apart , 2 blood sample collection ( 1 1 vaccination compare ) , 5 clinic visit , follow-up 6 month . They also complete diary card write temperature day symptom every day week get second shot . They also ask write drug medicine take .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Label Evaluation H5N1 Vaccine Vaccine Manufacturing Facilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal phase I/II , single center , open label study obtain additional safety immunogenicity data two 90 Âµg dos H5N1 . It anticipate dose level result acceptable proportion subject achieve potentially protective postvaccination antibody titer combine acceptable safety profile . The purpose current study induce maximal anti-H5N1 titer quickly possible order protect at-risk personnel manufacture commercial-scale H5N1 vaccine contract United States government . The study perform direction investigator University Maryland School Medicine 's Center Vaccine Development . Volunteers enrol , vaccinate , follow Sanofi Pasteur , Swiftwater , PA. Up 300 healthy vaccine production worker volunteer , age 18 year old , receive 90 mcg influenza A/H5N1 vaccine intramuscular injection . Volunteers receive 2 dos vaccine separate approximately 28 day . Serum HAI neutralize antibody titer assess approximately 1 month second vaccine dose . Volunteers observe clinic least 15 minute vaccination , maintain memory aid record oral temperature systemic local adverse event ( AEs ) seven day immunization . Volunteers return clinic Day 7 AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination ( indicate ) , review memory aid . Serum immunogenicity evaluation obtain prior first vaccination ( Day 0 ) Day 56 . Primary study objective : ( 1 ) determine safety subvirion inactivate A/H5N1 vaccine healthy vaccine production worker adult ; ( 2 ) determine immunogenicity subvirion inactivate H5N1 vaccine healthy adult approximately 1 month follow receipt two 90 mcg dos vaccine . Primary study endpoint : ( 1 ) adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event information ( solicit in-clinic via memory aid , concomitant medication , periodic targeted physical assessment ) ; ( 2 ) geometric mean titer ( GMT ) frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer two month receipt first dose vaccine ; ( 3 ) GMT frequency 4-fold great increase serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer 2 month receipt first dose vaccine ; ( 4 ) proportion subject achieve serum neutralize antibody titer 1:40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) .</detailed_description>
