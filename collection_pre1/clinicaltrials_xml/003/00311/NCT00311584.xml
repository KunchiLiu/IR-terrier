	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give irinotecan together temozolomide work treat young patient recurrent neuroblastoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine response rate pediatric patient relapse neuroblastoma ( NB ) treat irinotecan hydrochloride temozolomide . - Determine toxicity associate irinotecan temozolomide patient treat regimen . Secondary - Evaluate impact p53 loss function response rate event-free survival start relapse therapy . - Collect data ongoing analysis UGT1A1 polymorphism patient . - Collect bank serum nucleic acid specimen facilitate future biomarker study . - Evaluate feasibility collect blood sample group wide basis assessment change circulate marker angiogenesis . - Assess , preliminarily , effect irinotecan hydrochloride temozolomide circulate marker angiogenesis . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord disease status ( measurable disease [ measure conventional CT scan and/or MRI ] v evaluable disease [ tumor detect conventional morphologic analysis bone marrow aspirate/biopsy AND/OR abnormal uptake ≥ 1 site MIBG scan ] ) . Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 1 hour day 1-5 8-12 oral temozolomide day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
