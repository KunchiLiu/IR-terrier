All adult subject enrol main vaccine trial Vanderbilt ( 04-076 ) , Maryland ( 04-063 ) , Rochester ( 04-063 ) eligible enrollment cell-mediated immune response sub-study . A maximum 232 healthy ambulatory male female subject ; 180 subject 18 64 year old 64 subject age 65 year old , United States , could enrol . The primary objective : establish reproducible , functional cell-mediated immune response assay evaluate magnitude functional capacity T cell respond monovalent subvirion H5 influenza vaccine evaluate percent subject demonstrate CD4+ and/or CD8+ response approximately 14 day first vaccination 14 day 6 month second vaccination ( 04-063 ) , 14 day first second vaccination 14 day 6 month third vaccination ( 04-076 ) . The secondary objective : evaluate dose-related age-related humoral immunogenicity compare cellular immune response approximately 14 day first vaccination 14 day 6 month second vaccination ( 04-063 ) , 14 day first second vaccination 14 day 6 month third vaccination ( 04-076 ) establish CMI assay apply future avian vaccine immunogenicity evaluation , Chiron H9N2 avian influenza vaccine , future H7 vaccine , vaccine avian HA molecule . The study outcome measure , immunogenicity base H5 strain-specific cell-mediated immunity measure 14 day first , second , third ( 04-076 ) dose , month 6 last dose vaccine .</detailed_description>
