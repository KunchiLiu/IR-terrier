	<brief_summary>Sarcoidosis rare disease affect organ body . It characterize buildup immune-system ( fights infection body ) cell organ . These cell form small group call granuloma , lead inflammation surround tissue . Sarcoidosis commonly affect lung lymph node ( part immune system ) . The sign usually include shortness breath , fever , dry cough , chest pain . Other sign many patient include redness painful lump skin , reduce eyesight , joint pain , rarely , nervous system damage . Sarcoidosis commonly affect young middle-aged adult . There approved therapy treatment sarcoidosis . Corticosteroid ( steroid hormone ) therapy consider standard treatment . Only limited benefit show use corticosteroid therapy ease lung symptom improve lung function patient sarcoidosis . Also , effect therapy ( example : methotrexate , cyclophosphamide , anti-malarial drug , thalidomide ) immunosuppressant ( drug suppress body 's natural defense system [ immune system ] ) use small number patient well know cause long term problem . The drug use study call adalimumab . Adalimumab FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) approve patient moderately severely active rheumatoid arthritis . However , adalimumab approve treatment sarcoidosis . Adalimumab experimental study . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness adalimumab treatment patient sarcoidosis pulmonary ( lung ) involvement show symptoms disease even though currently treat medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study consist 11 visit ( include screen ) . Screening Procedures : A chest radiograph ( PA lateral ) must obtain within 3 month prior first study injection . It must indicate subject free tuberculosis ( TB ) . The chest radiograph also use confirm stage disease . Histologically proven sarcoidosis confirm . Demographic data , complete medical history ( include sign symptoms sarcoidosis ) , physical examination ( include vital sign , weight height ) . The medical history include question history recent TB history close contact person might TB . Concomitant medication , include use oral corticosteroid immunosuppressant , review record . In addition inclusion exclusion criterion review . A tuberculin skin test perform . A serum pregnancy test perform woman within 4-week period prior Baseline ( Week 0 ) Visit . All woman must test negative pregnancy screen . ATS dyspnea score assess . The 6-minute walk test perform Borg 's CR10 dyspnea score obtain . Pulmonary function test [ PFTs ] ( spirometry ) perform . Blood sample routine laboratory analysis obtain . AE monitoring also perform . Subjects qualify study assign receive treatment within 14 day screen visit except additional time require repeat TB skin test . Patients still meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion time baseline visit start injection . Subjects must agree use appropriate contraception . The procedure involve study visit describe . - Informed Consent : ( Screening Visit ) : Subjects ask review consent form discus study doctor study staff question may - Health Medication Questions : ( Screen , Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 45 , 52 ) : Subjects ask answer question health , medical history , medication take . - Physical Exam : ( Screen , Weeks 6 , 24 , 52 ) : Do physical exam . - Vital Signs : ( Screen , Weeks 0 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 52 ) : Blood Pressure , Pulse , Temperature - Height Weight : ( Screen , Week 52 ) - Blood Tests : ( Screen , Weeks 12 , 24 , 45 , 52 ) : Approximately 3 teaspoon blood drawn vein subject 's hand arm test . - Lung Function Test : ( Screen , Weeks 24 , 52 ) : Subject give mouthpiece ask take deep breath machine connect computer accord cues staff member . The machine measure capacity subject 's lung . - Chest X-ray : ( Screen , Weeks 12 , 24 , 52 ) : - Tuberculosis Test : ( Screen ) : Subject ask specific question regard history tuberculosis ( also call TB : type bacterial lung infection ) personal contact people active tuberculosis . Subjects active tuberculosis study . Subjects give skin test tuberculosis . For subject trial , TB skin test negative result must obtain . - 6 Minute Walk Test : ( Screen , Weeks 0 , 12 , 24 , 52 ) : Subject ask complete test walk 6 minute . Subject ask specific question regard shortness breath . - Pregnancy Test : ( Screen ) : A pregnancy blood test perform woman childbearing potential screening visit . The result test must negative order subject participate study . - ECG : ( Week 0 ) - Study Drug Administration : ( Weeks 0 , 2 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 45 ) : Subject receive study drug Week 0 Visit teach give injection . Subject give supply study drug clinical supply last next study visit . Subject required return unused study drug well packaging use study drug visit . - Questionnaires : ( Weeks 0 , 2 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 45 ) : Prior receive study drug , subject ask question symptom quality life , include ability care carry normal everyday activity ( respiratory health survey ) health questionnaire . All subject return efficacy safety evaluation time point include week 52 , whether complete entire treatment schedule whether ( still ) respond treatment . We watch carefully sign symptom CHF active TB follow-up evaluation patient . The study agent stop subject find NYHA Class III IV CHF , severe right-sided heart failure , cor pulmonale , and/or active TB enrollment study must return follow-up evaluation .</detailed_description>
