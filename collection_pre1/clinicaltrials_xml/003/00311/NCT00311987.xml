	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION BACKGROUND : In recent year , need achieve increasingly ambitious therapeutic goal dyslipidemias prompt search potent pharmacological agent low circulate atherogenic lipoprotein concentration enhance reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT ) . While mount evidence support use 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme reductase inhibitor ( statin ) main stay therapy patient require lipid modification therapy , many patient remain under-treated achieve National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) recommend goals.1-5 Recognizing new emerge data , NCEP III recently update guideline recognize potential aggressive low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) goal &lt; 70 mg/dl patient high risk cardiovascular events.3 The Treating New Targets ( TNT ) study show even patient stable coronary artery disease , goal lower currently recommend , &lt; 80 mg/dl , may desirable reduce and/or prevent recurrent cardiovascular events.6 More 40 % Americans LDL level 130 mg/dl high , 13 million Americans coronary artery disease may benefit lipid modification therapy . In individual , achieve optimal LDL goal treat associate lipid abnormality , include low HDL cholesterol and/or high triglyceride , many patient likely require combination therapy.3 , 7-13 Among novel therapeutic agent investigate selective thyroid hormone analogue . Such agent hold promise harness cholesterol-lowering property naturally occur thyroid hormone , triiodothyronine ( T3 ) thyroxine ( T4 ) , great receptor isoform tissue specificity result improve safety profile.14 , 15 Unlike statin , thyroid hormone analogue , addition cholesterol LDL-lowering effect , may favorably low lipoprotein ( ) ( Lp ( ) ) triglyceride levels.15-22 Also , potential thyroid hormone-mediated genomic non-genomic effect heart , certain population , congestive heart failure , may derive dual benefit use thyromimetic treatment.15 , 22 , 23 1.1.1 Effects Thyroid Hormone Lipid Metabolism Dyslipidemia long associate disorder thyroid metabolism ( i.e. , hypothyroidism ) potentially reversible thyroid hormone therapy.17 , 18 , 21 Early autopsy series demonstrate severe atherosclerosis individual premorbid hypothyroidism.24 , 25 In study thyroid hormone status affect radiolabeled lipoprotein kinetics , LDL find clear less rapidly hypothyroid animal man.26 Subsequently , hepatic LDL receptor number27 mRNA expression28 show low hypothyroid animal . More recently , characterization LDL receptor gene promoter reveal presence functionally important T3 regulatory elements.29 In addition lower total LDL cholesterol concentration treat hypothyroid patient , thyroid hormone therapy show study favorable impact particularly atherogenic lipoprotein , include Lp ( ) 30 small dense oxidizable LDL subfractions.31 , 32 Finally , thyroid hormone replacement therapy show decrease apoB100 lipoprotein synthesis result decrease Very Low Density Lipoprotein ( VLDL ) production hepatic triglyceride production.33 There also considerable evidence thyroid hormone receptor agonists directly indirectly affect reverse cholesterol transport , process cholesterol transport peripheral cell , include cholesterol-laden endothelial cell initial stage atherosclerosis , liver conversion bile acid . First , thyroid hormone affect activity apoA 1 lipoprotein,34 play several critical role RCT-generating HDL transport cholesterol peripheral tissue liver , principal protein constituent HDL activator lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase ( LCAT ) , esterify cholesterol surface pre-β-HDL . ApoA-I also stabilize increase level ATP-binding cassette A1 protein ( ABCA1 ) , , turn , promote efflux cholesterol phospholipid nascent HDL-particles . Thyroid hormone increase apoA-I gene expression liver intestine , part 5 ' flank thyroid hormone response element.35 , 36 Thyroid hormone also recently show increased scavenger class B type I receptor ( SR-BI ) , another regulator serum HDL concentration cholesterol flux , liver mice treat either T3 GC-1 ( thyroid hormone receptor modulator ) .37 Finally , thyroid hormone also know increase activity cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase ( CYP-7A1 ) 38 catalyzes rate-limiting step bile acid synthesis ; contrast , HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor opposite effect . This thyroid hormone-induced increase CYP-7A1 would expect increase bile acid cholesterol excretion , observe hyperthyroidism.39 1.1.2 Previous Clinical Research Previous study investigate therapeutic potential thyromimetic compound lipid modification heart failure.14,15,40 Early clinical investigation focus dextrothyroxine ( D-T4 ) , D-isomer thyroxine , think similar action , produce less tachycardia myocardial oxygen consumption.40 , 41 Although DT4 commonly use cholesterol lower drug 1970s,42 longer use clinical practice . The therapeutic effect DT4 evaluate Coronary Drug Project ( CDP ) . The Coronary Drug Project initiated 1965 , primarily answer prevail question safety efficacy long term use various cholesterol lower agent patient coronary artery disease . The Coronary Drug Project randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study , conduct 1966 1975 . It design evaluate efficacy safety five lipid-modifying drug 8,341 men , history prior myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Niacin , clofibrate , dextrothyroxine , two estrogen regimen evaluate study along placebo arm.43 , 44 DT4 administer 6.0 mg /day . The primary endpoint overall mortality 5 year . After mean follow-up 36 month , nonsignificant trend toward high mortality DT4 arm compare placebo , DT4 arm discontinued . As acknowledged original investigator , observe DT4-placebo difference overall mortality statistically significant judge statistical method utilized study.44 Nevertheless , give mortality trend low probability eventual benefit , decision make discontinue DT4 arm . In discontinue DT4 arm , study leadership recognize finding CDP leave open possibility dextrothyroxine may efficacious limited group carefully select myocardial infarction ( MI ) patient person free clinical CHD . 44 The net effect DT4 serum lipid ( observed fall correct concomitant rise placebo group ) sustain significant fall baseline level . The decrease approximately 12 % serum cholesterol level 15-20 % fast serum triglyceride levels.44 Following study , reveal DT4 dispense study contain less 0.5 % levothyroxine ( approximately 30 µg levothyroxine ) .44 Interestingly , later find contamination levothyroxine commercial preparation vary lot lot ( 0.5 % 2.3 % ) .45 Also , `` DT4 '' formulation significant thyromimetic effect , lead TSH suppression may become clinically relevant prolong use.47 Suboptimal dose thyrotoxic effect due drug contamination may explain 40 % DT4 patient require dose reduction.44 1.1.3 DITPA DITPA ( 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid ) analogue naturally occur thyroid hormone ( T3 ) specifically design improve cardiac performance lower potential tachycardia.22 , 40 , 46 DITPA bind thyroid hormone receptor α β T3 less affinity.41 In pre-clinical animal post-infarction model , DITPA improve calcium handling , promote angiogenesis , attenuate abnormal leave ventricular remodeling.47-53 In rat model CHF , DITPA demonstrate increased cardiac output increase leave ventricular dp/dt , comparable effect see T4 , significantly less tachycardia . In addition , increase α-myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) RNA gene expression induce DITPA treatment.41 When evaluate combination captopril , DITPA improve cardiac output dp/dt well increased rate LV relaxation compare captopril alone.54 In rabbit post-infarction model , DITPA decrease leave ventricular end diastolic pressure increase positive negative dp/dt without change heart rate leave ventricular systolic pressure.43 In model , use DITPA prevent abnormal SERCA transport abnormal contractile function associate myocardial infarction.42 , 44 Recently DITPA also note improve endothelial function follow myocardial infarction , action mediate nitric oxide.55 The objective present study evaluate feasibility DITPA , thyroid hormone analogue , potential lipid modification agent . KNOWN AND POTENTIAL TOXICITIES : Since DITPA thyroid hormone analogue thyromimetic action , safety side effect profile may similar observe thyroid hormone T3 T4 preparation ( e.g. , liothyronine levothyroxine ) . Although excess thyromimetic action theoretical side effect , also possible tissue-specific hypothyroidism might result drug fails sufficient thyromimetic activity particular tissue . Due pituitary effect DITPA , secondary lower TSH may result , turn may lead decreased endogenous production T4 . The potential effect theoretical biochemical change unknown . Thus , DITPA safety diligently monitor throughout study multiple examination , symptom scale , laboratory evaluation . Based known effect thyrotoxicosis hypothyroidism , side effect T3 T4 preparation , potential side effect DITPA may include : 1 . Cardiovascular : palpitation , tachycardia , arrhythmias , increase pulse blood pressure , heart failure , angina , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrest 2 .
