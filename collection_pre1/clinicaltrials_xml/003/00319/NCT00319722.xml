	<brief_summary>This study use EEG study brain wave rest response specific auditory visual sensory stimulus autistic child . We hypothesize , compare age peer , autistics show abnormalities electrophysiologic process sound ( tone phonemes ) visual stimulus ( flash light ) abnormalities able separate autistics typical child also clinical subgroup specific biological/electrophysiological characteristic . We hope find biological measure prove diagnostic autism young child use measurement treatment outcome future intervention trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : Aim 1 : To recruit 75 child autism 75 age- sex-matched control age 6 8 year old electrophysiological study characterize subject use appropriate instrument autism diagnosis , language function behavior/sensory profile , measure head circumference Aim 2 : To acquire analyze event-related potential ( ERP ) data auditory visual modality . ERP Hypothesis : Increased amplitude , alter morphology , impaired temporal discrimination delay responsiveness find early process hierarchy , severity abnormality associate severity dysfunction high level cortical processing . Aim 3 : To acquire EEG data analyze quantitatively . Quantitative EEG Hypothesis : Both interhemispheric intrahemispheric coherence measure EEG significantly deviant normal sample predict abnormality ERPs . In addition , EEG background alpha activity show post mature ( i.e . high ) frequency ( Hz ) would expect age focal epileptiform activity slow ( i.e . paroxysmal theta ) predict dysfunction ERPs . Rationale : The goal grant use electrophysiological measure characterize abnormality gate time autistic brain . The motivation research project derive finding model autism increase excitation/inhibition ratio , increase brain white matter volume alter connectivity . These change , alone combination , potential alter intensity , time integration signal multiple stage process . These signal problem potentially lead autistic behavioral phenotype cognitive processing abnormality include hyperspecificity/overselectivity autism , well feature autism sensory processing abnormality , seizure , anxiety . We believe characterize abnormality relate gate time phenomenon may lead development electrophysiological battery utilize early diagnosis , prognosis subtyping autism , well track treatment efficacy . Subjects : Subjects recruit general population , Ladders Clinic MGH/Spaulding Hospital , PI , Dr. Martien , employ clinician , well clinical practice Dr. Herbert MGH-Institute Health Professions preschool clinic . Flyers place available bulletin board two clinic throughout great Boston area , particularly Partners , Harvard , MIT , hospital , clinic , research , educational setting . The study seek enroll eighty 75 , 6 8 year old autism 75 age sex match control . Children consider inclusion autism group : - English primary language home - Experimental group : Child meet criteria autism ADI-R ADOS evaluation scale ( inclusion criterion explain consent process ) . They meet non Exclusionary criterion , include : - Known genetic disorder - Hearing gross sensorimotor deficit - Clinical evidence progressive encephalopathy - Asphyxia birth time - Frequent seizure use anticonvulsant drug psychotropic medication - Known presence focal brain lesion , brain atrophy ventriculomegaly . Children consider control group child meet criteria except meet criterion autism close ADOS ADI-R evaluation scale . Methods : The child seat comfortable chair physiological assessment begin head circumference obtain tape measure , EEG cap place child 's head gel apply electrode cap . The task include 5 minute baseline EEG record child look design monitor place 2 meter front chair . We proceed series auditory visual stimulus present computer two speaker place 1 meter front child ( auditory ) strobe ( visual ) 50 cm . The paradigm include presentation pair tone variable interstimulus interval present random order 65 dB SPL , paradigm either 1000 Hz 800 Hz 65 dB , final auditory paradigm two different phoneme , present 65 dB . The visual task involve presentation flash light vary frequency luminance reflect white board one meter child directly child 's visual field . In series , 1 minute break two block 100 trial total 200 trial . The experimenter show child interest toy talk child break . The parent ask complete Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales , Communication Symbolic Behavior Scales ( CSBS ) MacArthur Communicative Development Inventory . In case subject recruit Ladders infant sib study , use exist ADI-R ADOS data Ladders authorize release information . The total time laboratory session approximately 1 hour . The full battery task perform compliant child . For child whose attention maintain full battery , examiner stop give break need . The examiner go next task terminate session subject parent subject choose .</detailed_description>
