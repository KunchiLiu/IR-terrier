	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Chronic pancreatitis ( CP ) progressive inflammatory disease pancreas accompany abdominal pain late stage , exocrine endocrine insufficiency . The etiology CP include alcohol abuse , hereditary , ductal obstruction , tropical pancreatitis , systemic disease ( systemic lupus erythematosus cystic fibrosis etc . ) , idiopathic . Alcohol abuse account 70-80 % case chronic pancreatitis West 40 % India . The intensity injury depend duration amount alcohol consume . Hereditary pancreatitis transmit autosomal dominant trait account small subset case CP , occur due mutation cationic trypsinogen gene . Pancreatic duct obstruction may secondary trauma , pseudocysts , calcific stone tumor lead obstructive CP ( 1 ) . Tropical pancreatitis condition unknown etiology see predominantly south India tropical area World . Young patient commonly affect disease . Cassava consumption propose etiological factor due cyanogenic glycoside content however epidemiological study prove hypothesis ( 2 ) . Malnutrition suggest etiological factor tropical pancreatitis . Idiopathic pancreatitis account substantial number case . Many recent study emphasize role Reactive Oxygen Radicals ( ROR ) development oxidative stress hence inflammation pathogenesis chronic pancreatitis . Increased oxidative stress probably result increase exposure xenobiotics . Xenobiotics chemical substance present environment human being constantly expose . It conceivable many xenobiotics metabolize pancreas contains cytochrome P450 ( CYP450 ) enzymatic system . The metabolism xenobiotics occur two phase , Phase I Phase II . Phase I metabolism may result 'bioactivation ' xenobiotics , turn activate CYP system . Phase II involve attachment biotransformed compound biological molecule make polar thus easy excrete . The metabolism xenobiotics place oxidative stress overwhelm natural antioxidant defense body . The resultant production free radical may play important role pathogenesis CP ( 2 ) . Over induction enzyme cause increase utilization glutathione ( GSH ) , cause irreversible loss glutathione . Moreover glutathione serf reservoir cysteine/cystine require disulphide synthesis pancreatic digestive protein . This aggravate situation . Three type cytochrome enzymes induced xenobiotics . CYP2E1 specifically examine context liver injury . CYP1A metabolize smoke constituent potent carcinogen benzo ( ) pyrene . Cytochrome 3A inducible reactive oxygen specie generate aflatoxin B1 . Alcohol , nicotine cigarette smoke form tobacco consumption industrial pollutant consider xenobiotics overwhelm detoxification capacity cytochrome CYP450 system ( 3 ) . The CYP induction increase heme heme-oxygenase thus buttress antioxidant defense . The free radical peroxidation product may act second messenger block exocytosis lead increase autophagy crinophagy thus divert pancreatic enzyme interstitium . This lead degranulation mast cell induce inflammation mediate chemotaxis . The synthesis enzyme proteins pancreas also produce H2O2 , also induce free radical production . Furthermore depressed methionine trans-sulphuration pathway induces CYP well . The free radical generate process induce oxidative stress , implicate damage cell membrane due lipid peroxidation . Above , antioxidant level individual may low due either low intake depletion oxidative stress . Some study also indicate free radical cause disintegration antioxidative enzyme expose . However , role oxidative stress still fully explain whether oxidative stress cause chronic pancreatitis consequence . This establish two observation : 1 ) If oxidative stress note onset disease 2 ) If disease symptom relieve supplementation antioxidant . Patients alcoholic pancreatitis show increased oxidative stress . Supplementation antioxidant hence decrease production free radical may beneficial patient CP ( 4 ) . A study Braganza et al show CP involve oxidative stress in-patients CP ( 5 ) . This first study indicate role free radical pathogenesis chronic pancreatitis . However , mechanism occurs still unclear . The preliminary study show malondialdehyde ( MDA ) ; marker peroxidation secondary oxidative stress increase CP . In present propose study , aim find increased oxidative stress patient CP supplementation antioxidant relieve pain order establish relationship oxidant stress pathophysiology chronic pancreatitis . Objectives 1 . To evaluate effect antioxidant supplementation give daily pain relief chronic pancreatitis 6 month therapy compare placebo . 2 . To assess improvement oxidative stress antioxidant profile patient 6 month antioxidant supplementation measure marker oxidative stress blood antioxidant level . Material method Study Design : Double blind randomize controlled trial Patients All consecutive patient chronic pancreatitis attend pancreas clinic AIIMS include study per inclusion criterion . The diagnosis CP make evidence CP image study include plain film abdomen , Ultrasonography , Computerized tomography ( CT ) scan , endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Also hematological test , biochemical investigation do part diagnostic work-up . All patient undergo detailed clinical evaluation include detailed family history pancreatic disease diabetes . The WHO criterion use diagnose diabetes . The patient also inquire dietary history addiction tobacco alcohol . Patients explain purpose study clearly consent form duly sign . The patient regularly follow pancreas clinic All India Institute Medical Sciences , New Delhi . All patient treat standard manner include medical , endoscopic surgical treatment indicate . Inclusion criterion : CP significant pain i.e . least one episode pain month require oral analgesic one episode severe pain last three month require hospitalization . Sample size calculation Sample size calculate basis probability sample method . For 80 % power significance level 5 % ( = 0.05 ) , sample size 100 arm would require . Randomization blind Randomization treatment allocation largely ensure unbiased treatment comparison . A simple randomization scheme treatment allocation do use table random number Statistician/ Epidemiologist associate conduct study . He/she label box treatment individual patient number 1-200 accord randomization scheme . This person keep assignment code safe place ; code available investigator end trial . These serially open new patient recruit study . Double blind do ensure minimum bias i.e . blind researcher clinician attend patient randomization process allocation outcome evaluation affect blind patient identity drug intervention receiving . The inert placebo , identical active drug packaging , appearance schedule administration . Intervention One group give antioxidant supplementation group placebo . The antioxidant intervention daily dose 600 mg organic selenium , 0.54 g vitamin C , 9000 IU B-carotene , 270 IU vitamin E 2 g methionine . Both group supplement pancreatic enzyme . The enzyme administer capsule , contain 10,000 unit . Three capsule ( 30,000 ) unit require per meal thereby make 90,000 unit per day . Follow assessment study period : Clinical : - Assessment painful day requirement oral/ IV analgesic hospitalization month do . The patient provide pain diary get correct data . - Any symptom either due primary disease i.e . CP consider due intervention duly record . - Pain assessment clinical examination do visit patient clinic USG , ERCP , CT X-ray do require . Markers oxidative stress - MDA Marker antioxidant capacity defense - Superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) , Total glutathione , Ferric Reducing Assay Plasma ( FRAP ) Markers intervention compliance - Vitamins A , E , C *All biochemical investigation do baseline , 1 6 month intervention . All sample light protect purged nitrogen retard deterioration oxidation substrates storage . Statistics Descriptive statistic i.e . mean , standard deviation frequency distribution calculate variable study . To compare two group , Student 't ' test ( quantitative ) chi square test ( qualitative ) wherever applicable apply . To see trend within variable 2-way analysis variance ( parametric well non-parametric , whichever applicable ) do post-hoc analysis . P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistical significant . Statistic software SPSS 7.5 Windows use statistical analysis . Study Outcome Primary Outcome 1 . Reduction number painful day per month due chronic pancreatitis . Secondary Outcome 1 . Decrease . severe attack require hospitalization . 2 . Percentage patient pain-free . 3 . Increase marker antioxidant defense intervention group compare placebo group decrease oxidative stress parameter patient intervention compare placebo . References : 1 . Pitchumoni CS , Mohan AT .
