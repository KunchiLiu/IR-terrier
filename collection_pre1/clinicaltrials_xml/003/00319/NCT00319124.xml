	<brief_summary>To identify difference patient OA hip early stage healthy control group . Hypothesis 1.1 There significant difference patient OA hip early stage healthy control group term functional capacity , biomechanical / kinematic variable , muscle strength range motion . Osteoarthritis ( OA ) far prevalent joint disorder today . The knee hip large joint target important cause pain disability . In knee OA , show significant risk factor develop disease quadriceps weakness , joint instability , change joint load . A study hip OA show alter gait pattern , affect joint loading , one study show weakness abductor , adductor flexors around hip . As joint load muscle weakness important factor development knee OA , might well factor influence OA hip . The purpose case-control study compare hip OA patient healthy control group regard biomechanical clinical difference . Patients hip pain , activity limitation ( Harris Hip Score 60-95 p ) radiographically verify hip OA include . The healthy control group Harris Hip Score 100 p. One hundred ten patient fifty control ask fill questionnaire pain , stiffness physical function ( WOMAC ) , quality-of-life ( SF-36 v2 ) , self-efficacy ( Lorigue ) , activity ( PASE ) addition perform 6-minute walk test , sub-maximal cardiovascular function , strength , hip range motion test . Additionally , Qualisys Pro reflex 3D motion analysis system use walking , one-leg standing , raise chair sub-group 40 patient 20 control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 To identify difference patient OA hip early stage healthy control group . Hypothesis 1.1 There significant difference patient OA hip early stage healthy control group term functional capacity , biomechanical / kinematic variable , muscle strength range motion . Material method . Design . A case-control study Inclusion / exclusion criterion . Twenty-five patient diagnosed unilateral bilateral OA hip recruit Norwegian Sport Medicine Centre , Diakonhjemmet Orthopaedic Centre , Ullevål University Hospital , Oslo , Norway . PPatients also recruit ad newspaper brief information national tv . Radiographiccally verified OA hip accordance Danielsson 's criterion minimal joint space . Patients exclude history resent trauma functional impairment low limb disease might interfere participation . Control subject health problem injuries functional impairment low limb match patient OA hip age gender . Outcome measure . Background descriptive data , include anthropometrical ( age , gender , height , weight ) sociodemographic information ( marital status , social support , leisure time , sick-leave , physical activity , occupational background , co-morbidity , hip pain history , former treatment hip pain / OA ) , consumption analgetics collect questionnaire inclusion . Outcome measure cover functional level define World Health Organization 's ( WHO ) International Classification Functioning , Disability , Health ( 2002 ) include : Pain activity limitation : Hip pain assess horizontal visual analogue scale ( VAS ) ( 0-100 mm ; 0 represent `` pain '' 100 represent `` much pain he/she possibly imagine '' ) ( Revill et al . 1976 ) . Both self-reported observed functional capacity evaluate . Self-reported functional capacity register disease-specific questionnaire Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) ( Bellamy et al . 1988 ) . Observed functional capacity assess 6 minute walk test ( Enright , 2003 ) , patient instruct walk quickly/fast possible forth back 20 course , subaximal bikecycle test ( Astrand , 1986 ) heart-rate register constant load speed . Health related quality life pain management : Quality life assess use generic questionnaire SF-36 v.2 ( Jenkinson , 1999 ) . Self-efficacy belief pain register use self-efficacy subscale control pain develop Lorig et al ( Lorig et al . 1989 ) . The scale find valid reproducible patient chronic arthritis ( Lorig et al . 1989 ) . Gait analysis : Kinematic data collect use Qualisys pro-reflex motion analysis system eight camera sample frequency 240 Hz synchronize two force platform sample rate 960Hz ( AMTI Model LG6 ) . All marker present stand calibration . During dynamic trial anatomical marker remove . Subjects instructed walk along 17m walkway two force plate embed . The subject walk self-selected pace practice trial perform subject could contact force platform one foot ( target ) constant velocity within 5 % deviation . Speed measure photoelectric beam locate 3.06m apart , midway along walkway . Experienced physical therapist responsible patient information , instruction data collection . Muscle strength : Muscle strength hip extensor , -flexors , knee flexor -extensors , ankle flexor extensor , addition ankle plantar flexion test isokinetically accord manufacturer 's manual ( Cybex 6000 ) . Isokinetic muscle test commonly use literature various patient population ( Inkster et al . 2003 ; Holm et al . 2000b ; Brox et al . 1995 ; Lephart et al . 1993 ; Newton et al . 1993 ) . The test protocol consist five repetition angular velocity 60 deg/sec maximal performance . In order prepare patient test , eliminate learning effect obtain stable performance , patient give four test-repetitions speed main test . An experienced physical therapist perform test . Range motion : Range motion measure goniometer accord standard procedure ( Holm et al . 2000a ) . Follow : Data collect inclusion ( patient control subject ) intervention period ( patient ) . Blinding : Personnel responsible intervention involve data collection . Registration complication , drop-outs adherence : Complications drop-outs register person responsible data collection . Adherence exercise protocol register physical therapist responsible treatment . Power calculation : Lack information study comparable OA population literature make difficult make precise power calculation . Assumption sample size ( 110 patient 50 control subject ) therefore base result former study patient OA knee mixed population knee- hip patient . Statistical analysis : Both non-parametric parametric statistic use data analysis . Ethics : All patient control subject receive write oral information study sign inform consent inclusion ( enclose ) . The project perform accord recommendation Helsinki Declaration application send Regional Committee Medical Research Ethics Oslo November 2003 .</detailed_description>
