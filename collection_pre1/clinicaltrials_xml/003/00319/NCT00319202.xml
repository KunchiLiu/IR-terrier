	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Assess Effects Candesartan Carbohydrate Metabolism Obese Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : During last year , worldwide prevalence diabetes mellitus type II ( DM2 ) increase dramatically , impact cardiovascular morbidity mortality . It estimate 171 million people suffer disease ( 2.8 % worldwide population ) 's predicted increase 366 million ( 6.5 % ) 2030 , 298 million develop country . Currently , Latin America , DM2 prevalence range 1.2 % 8 % , expect increase 38 % next 10 year , high level urban zone . Recently , demonstrate Colombian population lower abdominal circumference report Caucasian population present increase risk develop metabolic syndrome coronary artery disease . Moreover , abdominal obesity population associate high level inflammatory marker , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) proinflammatory cytokine . Nowadays , relationship abdominal obesity , inflammation , insulin resistance , diabetes mellitus type 2 , metabolic syndrome cardiovascular disease crucial aim research , especially population Colombian , high risk affect epidemic diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease . The occurrence DM2 associate 2 4 fold increase risk develop coronary disease . The diabetic patient present unstable angina great risk develop acute myocardial infarct ( AMI ) diabetic patient AMI risk death non-diabetic patient . Additionally , subject DM2 increase risk experience cardiovascular event ( 1.5 3 time ) , great recurrence mortality cause . The incidence severity peripheral arterial disease also increase 2 4 time diabetic patient . The current criterion DM2 diagnosis establish American Association Diabetes glucose level fast &gt; 126 mg/dl , establish base risk suffer ophthalmic renal micro-vascular complication value superior limit . Nevertheless , several work show patient alter fast glucose level ( ≥100 mg/dl - &lt; 126 mg/dl ) increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . We recently report Colombia , existence strong association presence cardiovascular risk factor alter fast plasma glucose , association great presence abnormal glucose blood level glucose overload test . This association explain since hyperglycemia per-se may implicate development atherosclerosis due metabolic structural change endothelial level . At long term may result irreversible alteration ; `` non-returning '' point lead cardiovascular complication typical diabetes . According observation , group recently show patient alter glycemia fasting , regardless classic factor cardiovascular risk , present great risk coronary disease , support hypothesis hyperglycemia lead structural change endothelial wall . It well know people insulin resistance present less vasodilatation mediate insulin alter endothelium dependent vasodilatation . Additionally , describe insulin cause physiologic vasodilatation skeletal muscle healthy subject , effect block insulin-resistance obesity . In population , find obesity , hypercholesterolemia diabetes related flow-mediated vasodilatation reduction . The endothelial dysfunction strongly related insulin resistance syndrome . At time , endothelial dysfunction worsens resistance insulin , increase vascular reactivity predispose cardiovascular disease . It propose vasodilator effect insulin primarily due great expression mRNA endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) due probable increase transcriptional rate . There elements support fact activity modulate C-kinase protein ( PKC ) . The inhibition PKC increase mRNA level eNOS . Prolonged incubation endothelial cell selective inhibitor PKC beta isoform increase mRNA level eNOS . This observation may important clinical implication since PKC activation vasculature diabetic subject alteration vascular wall . The exist relationship endothelial dysfunction insulin resistance dependent multiple factor . Obesity generate alteration endothelial function metabolically active capillary bed , alter lipase lipoprotein ( LPL ) link endothelium glycosaminoglycans . The ultimate loss cause aggressive factor smoke oxygen free radical , alters endothelial function also impair action LPL cause hypertriglyceridemia insulin resistance factor . At time , alteration endothelial function capillary bed reduce interstitial flow , carry less insulin delaying delivery muscular tissue . Additionally , propose less surface endothelium functionally normal vessel irrigate skeletal muscle . It also show hyperinsulinemia predict appearance atherosclerosis cardiovascular event , independently risk factor . The increase adipocytes abdominal level directly relate condition insulin resistance hyperinsulinism . The hyperinsulinemia promote release free fatty acid adipocyte later hepatic transformation oxidize LDL , great atherogenic potential . Also , abdominal adipocytes response increase free fatty acid , oxidize LDL non-well define metabolic factor increase production release proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-α ) interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , show able reduce expression activity nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) human cultivate umbilical endothelium cell , suggest could mechanism abdominal obesity relate endothelial dysfunction . In sense , recently demonstrate cultured endothelial cell , angiotensin II , receptor AT1 , stimulate TNF-α production , time activates metalloproteinase 2 , enzyme induces change endothelium structure stability atherosclerotic plaque . This effect angiotensin II mediate AT1 receptor , since show CANDESARTAN inhibited production TNF-α induce Angiotensin II . The increase production storage free fatty acid may mechanism angiotensin II relate development insulin resistance . It demonstrate elevated level free fatty acid induce insulin resistance inhibition transport phosphorylation glucose muscular level , follow reduction glycogen synthesis glucose oxidation . Additionally , suggest free fatty acid may interfere stimulation insulin GLUT 4 hexokinase activity . Also , angiotensin II stimulate effect transcription rate ob gene human adipocytes . The ob gene charge codify leptin protein , inhibit appetite regulates thermogenesis . The chronic sustain increase leptin level lead leptin-resistance condition , condition hormone lose physiological action . The increase leptin level produce great expression UPC 2 ( Uncoupling protein 2 ) action mediate Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors ( PPARs ) , interfere mitochondrial respiration chain pancreatic beta cell , get reduction ATP generation block first peak insulin secretion . This offset mechanism seem opposed insulin 's lipogenic effect avoids great lipid storage . Unfortunately , derive consequence alteration insulin secretion lower efficacy maintain euglycemia maintain glucidic homeostasis . On hand , hyperleptinemia , mediate sympathetic activity increase sodium renal resorption , lead increase blood pressure , add great expression angiotensinogen produce hypertrophied lipid cell . These cell generate angiotensin II activate adipocyte differentiation regulate fat storage response nutritional change . Recently , clinical trial demonstrate angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEIs ) ARA II , reduce risk present new case DM2 compare antihypertensive therapy . However , clinical trial address specifically study effect ARA II improvement dysglycemia prevention diabetes type 2 . Additionally , treatment ACEI ARA II show improve resistance peripheral insulin animal model clinical study . The mechanism renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade beneficial effect responsiveness insulin totally clear . In obese Zucker-type rat , demonstrate chronic treatment selective ARA II receptor produce significant increase GLUT 4 transporter expression skeletal muscle reduction concentration plasma fatty acid associate improvement responsiveness insulin . Although mechanism still speculative , beneficial effect renin-angiotensin system blockade , demonstrate several study HOPE , LIFE , VALUE , responsiveness insulin prevention development new case DM2 , suggest angiotensin II produce adipocytes obese subject associate insulin resistance syndrome support execution clinical trial orient establish beneficial effect ARA II prevention DM2 susceptible individual come population high risk develop CVD diabetes mellitus , Colombian one . Hypothesis : In non-diabetic non-hypertensive subject dysglycemia abdominal obesity : The treatment candesartan 16/32 mg/d 6 month improves carbohydrate metabolism measure HOMA insulin sensibility index , oral glucose tolerance Test ( OGTT ) , fast plasma glucose level , glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) . The effect treatment candesartan carbohydrate metabolism relate reduction plasma concentration adipocytokines IL-6 , CRP , Leptin Adiponectin ; oxidative stress marker plasma concentration Malonaldehyde urinary concentration 8-Isoprostanes . These effect carbohydrate metabolism , inflammatory adipocytokines oxidative stress marker independent change arterial blood pressure .
