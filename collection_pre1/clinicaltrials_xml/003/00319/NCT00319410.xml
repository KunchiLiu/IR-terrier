	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial compare two method diagnostic hysteroscopy : vaginoscopic hysteroscopy vs. traditional method . Pain intensity estimate use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) , patient satisfaction evaluate . These endpoint compare treatment assignment . Vaginoscopic hysteroscopy associate significantly low VAS score , indicate reduce experience pain treatment group ; however , associate improved patient satisfaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Hysteroscopy Approaches</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To compare vaginoscopic approach diagnostic hysteroscopy without anesthesia traditional diagnostic hysteroscopy intracervical injection Mepivacaine Hydrochloride 3 % . METHODS : A total 130 woman undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy include study randomize , use computer-generated randomization list , two group ratio 2:1 . Eighty three woman underwent vaginoscopy without speculum , tenaculum anesthesia . Forty seven woman receive intracervical anesthesia 10 ml 3 % mepivacaine hydrochloride solution inject two site ( 3:00 9:00 position ) underwent traditional hysteroscopy use speculum tenaculum . Hysteroscopy perform use rigid 3.7 mm hysteroscope medium 0.9 % saline , image transmit screen visible patient . A Visual Scale Analogue ( VAS ) consist 10 cm line use assess intensity pain experienced procedure . Overall patient satisfaction assess , immediately , 15 minute later , three day post hysteroscopy . RESULTS : The mean pain score significantly low vaginoscopy group ( 3.8±2.7 v 5.34±3.23 , p=0.01 ) . Patient satisfaction rate similar group . CONCLUSION : Patients report significantly less pain vaginoscopic approach diagnostic hysteroscopy even without anesthesia compare patient undergoing traditional procedure anesthesia . This new approach therefore consider replacement traditional hysteroscopic technique .</detailed_description>
