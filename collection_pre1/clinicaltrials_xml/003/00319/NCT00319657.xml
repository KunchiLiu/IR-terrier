	<brief_summary>The Stanford Medical Center Program Multi-Organ Transplantation Division Bone Marrow Transplantation enrol patient research study determine blood stem cell inject kidney transplantation change immune system immunosuppressive drug completely withdraw . Patients must healthy , completely human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -matched brother sister organ stem cell donor . One two month kidney transplant surgery , blood stem cell remove donor cell frozen . After transplant surgery , recipient receive radiation anti-T cell antibody treatment two week prepare injection stem cell . The stem cell injected end two-week treatment . If stem cell persist recipient , immunosuppressive drug gradually reduce withdrawn completely least six month transplantation . Patients follow Stanford clinic transplant patient . Patients live outside San Francisco Bay Area must remain near Stanford six week transplant surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Kidney Blood Stem Cell Transplantation That Eliminates Requirement Immunosuppressive Drugs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine proportion patient withdraw completely immunosuppressive drug maintain normal function HLA-matched living relate donor kidney transplant . Fifteen participant condition total lymphoid irradiation ( TLI ) rabbit anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) , give infusion donor `` mobilize '' blood mononuclear cell prior transplantation . This single-center , open-label study adult renal transplant patient . Fifteen patient receive TLI , ATG , infusion CD34+ select G-CSF mobilize blood cell combine fixed number ( 1x10^6 ) CD3+ T cell mobilize blood cell source . Patients receive one-month course mycophenolate mofetil six 12 month taper course cyclosporine discontinue six month . At serial timepoints ( 1 ) graft function monitor , ( 2 ) chimerism measure recipient white blood cell subset , ( 3 ) mix lymphocyte response ( MLR ) assay peripheral blood mononuclear cell donor third party cell perform , ( 4 ) protocol biopsy graft obtain . An attempt make discontinue cyclosporine six month ( 1 ) chimerism detectable least 180 day CD34+ CD3+ cell infusion , ( 2 ) stable graft function without clinical rejection episode , ( 3 ) lack histologic rejection protocol biopsy . In proposed study , patient give target dose 8-10x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg 1x10^6 CD3+ cells/kg sustain chimerism may necessary sustain tolerance graft .</detailed_description>
