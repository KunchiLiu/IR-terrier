	<brief_summary>Point A , major critical point dose specification intracavitary brachytherapy , define cross uterine artery ureter treatment cervical cancer . However , currently advocate system use hypothetical point A ( HPA ) estimate dosimetry brachytherapy . This study localize anatomic point A ( APA ) cervical cancer patient reference radiotherapy . We use laparoscopic clipping technique localize APA cervical cancer patient pelvic paraaortic lymph node sample . When patient receive brachytherapy , orthogonal radiograph obtain insertion tandem colpostats use Henschke afterloading applicator .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Radiation therapy ( RT ) , relevant integration external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) intracavitary brachytherapy ( ICBT ) , important part treatment cervical cancer . Even though concurrent chemoradiation therapy ( CCRT ) improve control locoregional recurrence distant metastasis locally advanced disease , role RT remain important essential . ICBT essential component RT use deliver high localize dose primary cervical lesion adjacent parametria attempt minimize dose nearby normal tissue . The conventional point-based dose prescription system apply decade . Incorporation modern image technique , namely computerize tomography ( CT ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) ICBT , enable radiation oncologist individualize treatment volume yet , applicable routine practice . Point A , since define Tod Meredith 1938 revise 1953 , widely accept sacrosanct reference point dose prescription ICBT . Point A defined point 2 cm cervical o 2 cm apart os line perpendicular uterine axis . It hypothetical point represent crossover ureter uterine artery , locate paracervical triangle , consider critical point radiation tolerance . This definition point A provide easy way prescribe dose ICBT integrate EBRT . However , dosimetry accord orthogonal radiograph would depend solely applicator geometry individual tumor volume location . The International Commission Radiation Units Measurements ( ICRU ) report 38 propose set guideline uniform reporting . Reporting dimension reference volume still depend geometry applied applicator remain difficult report ICBT . Thus , point A still use reference point dose prescription correlate treatment outcome clinical trial . CCRT consider standard care locally advanced cervical cancer . To dissect patient population , may benefit less morbidity CCRT , radical surgery plus subsequent RT , sample pelvic paraaortic lymph node prior decision intend surgery utilized performing laparoscopy laparotomy stage IB IIA . Moreover , sample procedure also provide pathological proof delineation lymph node risk important reference RT field design . During sample procedure , observe point cross ureter uterine artery could visualize mark use hemoclips . Therefore , anatomic position point A could visualize orthogonal film closure abdominal wound . In study , attempt compare location radiation dose anatomic point A ( APA ) hypothetical point A ( HPA ) fractionate ICBT .</detailed_description>
