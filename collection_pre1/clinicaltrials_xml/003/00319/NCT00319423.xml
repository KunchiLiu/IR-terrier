	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To evaluate effect exercise therapy program 12 week patient education program compare patient education program hip function ( WOMAC ) patient hip osteoarthritis ( OA ) ( radiographically verify hip OA , Harris Hip Score 60-95p , &gt; 3 month hip pain ) . Aim 2 : To identify biomechanical difference gait analysis patient hip OA follow either exercise therapy patient education program , patient education program . Main hypothesis : Significant improve hip function ( WOMAC ) demonstrate patient hip osteoarthritis follow patient education program additionally 12 week exercise therapy program , compare go patient education program . MATERIAL AND METHODS Design : A randomized control trial . Inclusion Criteria : Patients 40 80 year old uni- bilateral hip disability eligible hip surgery recruit Orthopaedic Centre , Ullevål University Hospital , NIMI , Diakonhjemmets Sykehus ( Hospital ) , Oslo . Inclusion criteria subject : - Harris Hip Score ( 35 ) 60 95 , hip pain 3 month . Harris Hip Score ( 35 ) 60 use regularly institution one criterion hip surgery ( arthroplasty ) , therefore Harris Hip Score 60 95 use inclusion criterion present study population . - All subject x-ray take . Those radiographic verified hip OA classify orthopaedic surgeon ( LN ) accord Danielsson 's criterion radiographic hip OA ( 34 ) . One hundred ten patient radiographic verified hip OA include randomize control trial Exclusion Criteria - Patients exclude history resent trauma functional impairment low limb disease might interfere participation ( rheumatoid arthritis , cancer , osteoporosis , severe back pain , knee OA ) . - Patients co-morbidities tolerate physical activity exclude . Interventions It consider ethically practically feasible use control group receive treatment study . Hence , randomize group offer patient education intervention , one group receive exercise therapy addition . Patient Education ( KLASSBO M , 2003 ) : All patient hip disability without verified radiographic OA include study receive two individual three small-group ( 6-7 patient ) session last one hour time . Exercise Protocol : The exercise protocol include exercise former study comparable patient population . The intensity strength- flexibility exercise meet American College Sports Medicine 's ( ACSM ) recommendation develop maintain muscular fitness adults.Patients require exercise 60 minute , three day week 12 week . Patient 's attendance exercise program ( compliance ) register physical therapist . Outcome Measurements Pain Functional Activity : The primary ( main ) outcome measurement self-reported functional outcome measure , disease-specific questionnaire Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) . WOMAC find valid , reliable responsive outcome measure patient hip OA . The self-reported Physical Activity Score Elderly ( PASE ) use record individual activity level prior inclusion follow-up interval . Hip pain record visual analogue scale ( VAS ) rating 0 100 mm ; 0 represent `` pain '' 100 represent `` much pain he/she possibly imagine '' . The pain record 6 minute walk test ( se ) . Six minute walk test ( Enright , 2003 ) : Observed functional capacity cardiovascular fitness assess six minute walk test . This test reliability estimate old adult validate old adult individual total hip arthroplasty . Health related quality life pain management : Quality life assess use self-administered generic questionnaire 36-item short-form health survey ( SF-36 ) version 2 . Hip Biomechanics : Gait analysis : Kinematic data collect use Qualisys pro-reflex motion analysis system eight camera sample frequency 240 Hz synchronize two force platform sample rate 960 Hz ( AMTI Model LG6 ) . Subjects instructed walk along 17 walkway two force plate embed . Speed measure photoelectric beam locate 3.06 apart , midway along walkway . Eight ten walk trial average subject . Kinematic kinetic variable include hip , knee , ankle angle moment , sagittal , frontal transverse plane . The setup analysis software use collaborative group University Delaware use . Balance ( Suni et al . 1998 ) : Static balance test one-leg standing . The subject advise stand still possible center pressure register force plate ( AMTI Model LG6 ) . The test develop adult use several former study . Dynamic balance register patient perform two-legged raise seat position stand position force plate ( Mizner &amp; Snyder-Mackler ) . Center pressure , kinematic , kinetic data register . Muscle strength : Isokinetic muscle strength test Technogym REV 9000 ( Gambettola , Italia ) measure peak torque 60°s-1 hip flexion/extension , knee flexion/extension ankle flexion/extension . Muscle strength hip abduction conduct isometrically dynamometer . Cardiovascular Fitness ( Åstrand &amp; Rodahl , 1986 ) : test sub-maximal bicycle ergometer test accord method describe Åstrand &amp; Rodahl . The load adjust subject . Results correct age gender express ml O2 / kg / min . Range motion : register plastic goniometer . Flexion , abduction , adduction register supine position , fixation contralateral leg . Internal external rotation register prone position fixation buttock . Extension register accord Thomas test . Data Collections Follow-Up In randomize control trial ( Aim 1 2 ) , data collect inclusion , 15 week intervention period , follow- ups 6 month , 1 year , 2 year . Data outcome measurement collect patient follow-up , except gait-analysis data ( kinematic kinetic data ) ( Aim 2 ) . These data collect inclusion intervention period ( 15 week ) . Power Calculations : The WOMAC Index main outcome measurement RCT . Power calculation base standard deviation 23 mm , minimum clinically important difference 15 mm group calculate need 49 patient group . To account possible drop-outs , 110 patient include RCT . Blinding : Personnel responsible intervention involve data collection . Physical therapist collect data blind patient ' group allocation . A research coordinate person , involve part study intervention data collection , responsible randomization procedure ( give subject information group allocation ) Statistical Analysis : Data randomize control trial analyze accord intention treat principle additional analysis compliers adhere exercise protocol cut-off value 24 training session . Registration Complications , Drop-Outs Compliance : Complications drop-outs register person responsible data collection . There used intention treat analysis . Compliance patient education exercise protocol register physical therapist responsible treatment . Ethics : All patient control subject receive write oral information study sign inform consent inclusion . The project perform accord recommendation Helsinki Declaration . Approval obtain Regional Committee Medical Research Ethics .</detailed_description>
