	<brief_title>Role Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) Acute Lung Injury/Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In previous lab experiment , observe evidence pulmonary edema follow alveolar epithelial overexpression VEGF , suggest potential role VEGF ARDS . In addition , find prevent VEGF reach target receptor ( ) overexpressing soluble form VEGF receptor protein prevent edema formation . These observation heighten plausibility VEGF playing important role development increase pulmonary capillary permeability acute lung injury . Understanding role VEGF play ARDS consequently provide ideal opportunity discover new therapy ARDS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients meet AmericanEuropean Consensus Conference criterion ARDS [ ( 1 ) Widespread pulmonary infiltrates ; ( 2 ) Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 18 mmHg ; ( 3 ) PaOz/FiO ; ratio 200 ; ( 4 ) compatible history ] , acute lung injury [ ARDS , PaOz/FiOz ratio 300 ] , increase risk develop acute lung injury sepsis , pancreatitis , trauma , acid aspiration , radiation chemotherapyinduced lung toxicity , near drown . Pulmonary edema divide two broad category : hydrostatic cardiogenic increasedpermeability noncardiogenic edema12 . Since ARDS noncardiogenic origin , patient pulmonary edema due congestive heart failure serve control group . 2 . Inpatients endotracheally intubate . 3 . Patients able provide inform consent inform consent grant family member legal health care proxy . 4 . Males females 18 year old . Individuals hypoxemic bronchoscopy perform safely . Patients require V\0z &gt; 0.7 and/or PEEP 15 exclude . 2 . If patient unable tolerate bronchoscopy severe acidosis , tension pneumothorax , active bronchospasm , hemodynamically significant cardiac arrhythmia , intractable shock define inability maintain mean arterial pressure 60 mmHg severe uncorrectable bleeding diathesis ( tendency ) otherwise determine pulmonary physician . 3 . Females pregnant accept study . 4 . Patients recent ( 48 hour ) acute myocardial infraction accept study . 5 . Patients history adverse reaction lidocaine accept study . 6 . Patients lack capacity give inform consent due acute panic attack , `` intensive care unit '' psychosis psychologic dysfunction .</criteria>
