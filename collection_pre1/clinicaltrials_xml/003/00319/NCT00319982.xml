	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial ass whether administration diltiazem may able decrease development progression hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) . Diltiazem commonly use medication treatment high blood pressure study animals HCM suggest diltiazem decrease disease development . This study specifically target individual `` prehypertrophic '' phase HCM -- document sarcomere gene mutation without echocardiographic EKG evidence LVH , therefore without clinical diagnosis HCM . The hypothesis study start diltiazem administration early life ( prehypertrophic phase ) decrease progression HCM individual sarcomere gene mutation . This assessed look improvement heart 's ability relax use echocardiography , well exploratory analysis broad range feature reflect heart 's structure function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY RATIONALE : Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) genetic disorder characterize histopathologic finding cardiac myocyte disarray fibrosis , clinical manifestation unexplained leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) , diastolic dysfunction , increase risk sudden death . It common disorder affect approximately 1 1000 individual general population . Dominantly-acting mutation contractile proteinsâ€”genes encode element sarcomere apparatus -- show genetic etiology HCM . Contemporary management strategy HCM focus identification individual high risk sudden death management symptom . There current therapy available address disease prevention phenotypic attenuation . Dysregulation intracellular calcium handle fundamental early manifestation sarcomere mutation . Animal model HCM demonstrate abnormal Ca2+ cycling prior development myocyte disarray hypertrophy . Manipulation intracellular Ca2+ handling young , pre-hypertrophic mouse HCM via administration L-type Ca2+ channel blocker , diltiazem , attenuate degree hypertrophic remodel diminish phenotypic manifestation sarcomere mutation . Notably , treatment initiate later life , LVH allow develop , significant effect . Although strategy yet test human , diltiazem commonly-used medication long track record safety tolerability . Mutation carrier without discernible echocardiographic leave ventricular hypertrophy ( designate G+/LVH- ) represent unique population individual early disease ideal candidate preemptive strategy attempt attenuate phenotypic development . One clinical marker early disease subtle abnormality LV diastolic function , detectable tissue Doppler echocardiography ( TDI ) . Individuals sarcomere mutation evidence abnormal diastolic function TDI demonstrate 13-19 % reduction early myocardial relaxation velocity ( E ' ) , compare healthy control . Since LVH develop age-dependent manner , genetic diagnosis provide mechanism early identification individual risk develop HCM , prior expression diagnostic clinical manifestation . One goal next era medicine evolve contemporary symptom palliation late stage disease early preventive strategy instead strive alter natural history disease development . STUDY OBJECTIVES : The goal trial evaluate safety , feasibility , efficacy diltiazem administration attenuate natural history HCM , focus tolerability impact diastolic function . The primary efficacy endpoint improvement diastolic function G+/LVH- subject receive active therapy compare placebo , measure improved mean tissue Doppler echocardiographic early diastolic velocity ( E ' ) diltiazem group compare placebo group 2 year randomization . As pilot trial , treatment effect multiple related parameter include change LV dimension mass , development overt LVH , development cardiac magnetic resonance ( CMR ) evidence fibrosis , level serum biomarkers analyze exploratory manner fully characterize potential treatment effect . The safety endpoint excess cause death , cardiovascular death ( include sudden death ) , heart failure require medication hospitalization , significant difference development symptoms/side effect necessitate discontinuation treatment active v placebo arm . STUDY DESIGN AND SCHEMA A placebo-controlled , randomized double-blind Pilot clinical trial . Eligible G+/LVH- subject undergo baseline study ( physical examination , echocardiography , CMR , blood test ) randomize receive diltiazem placebo double blind fashion . There 3 week titration phase increase dose study drug target . The total duration study protocol 5 year : study drug continue total 4 year 1 year post-treatment evaluation perform . The primary endpoint assess 2 year treatment . Study visit data collection consist echocardiography 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 36,48 , 60 month . Annual evaluation consist physical exam , echocardiography , EKG , measurement serum biomarkers also perform . PATIENT POPULATION Eligible subject identify sarcomere mutation clinical evidence LVH . Children age 15 year old enrol Brigham Women 's Hospital ; child age 5-15 year enrol via Children 's Hospital Boston . Major Inclusion Criteria : - Preclinical HCM define G+/LVH- criterion - Able provide inform consent ( parental consent ) Major Major Exclusion Criteria : Contraindication diltiazem administration , include follow pre-existing condition : - Second third degree atrioventricular block - Symptomatic heart failure - Sick sinus syndrome - Concomitant treatment verapamil and/or beta-blockers - Concomitant treatment cyclosporine FK506 - Impaired hepatic renal function - Age &lt; 5 year - Pregnant breastfeed woman PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ENDPOINTS PRIMARY ENDPOINT : Improvement diastolic function reflect averaged E ' velocity compare baseline ( E ' velocity improve , remain stable , decline less treated group ) 2 year follow initiation treatment . As pilot study , numerous parameter reflect myocardial structure function also explore . SECONDARY ENDPOINTS : - Development leave ventricular hypertrophy - Improvement , stability , attenuation increase serum biomarkers ( e.g. , BNP , ST2 , PICP , PIIINP , PINP ) 3 , 6 , 18 month , annually study end - Improvement , stability attenuation increase CMR evidence myocardial fibrosis - Impact leave ventricular morphology , remodel , cavity size - Safety : excess cause death , CV death ( include sudden death ) , heart failure require medication hospitalization ; No excess adverse event - Tolerability : excess need reduce withdraw study medication ; significant difference adherence study medication</detailed_description>
