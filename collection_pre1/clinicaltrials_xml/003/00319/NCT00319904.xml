	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : We collect DNA 500 rigorously diagnosed patient schizophrenia allow u future examine phenotypic subtypes relation genetic variant . Phenotypes include subgroup base clinical symptom , medication response , biological marker include neuroimaging pharmacologic challenge . Subjects : DNA sample clinical characterization obtain 500 schizophrenia patient treat Freedom Trail Clinic Erich Lindemann Mental Health Association MGH First Episode Psychosis Program . The diagnostic interview conduct research psychiatrist typically take 1-3 hour . The following clinical data obtain subject : Demographics ( age , gender , ethnicity ) Weight , height Current medication dose Age onset ( prodrome psychosis ) Incidence psychotic disorder first-degree family member ( without identifier ) Diagnosis subtype History hallucination , delusion , negative symptom , disorganization mood disorder History response ( full , partial , response ) symptom ( hallucination , delusion , disorganization negative symptom ) conventional antipsychotic , atypicals clozapine Number hospitalization Smoking behavior ( use Fagerstrom ) The additional clinical assessment take approximately 2-3 hour include follow clinical rating scale cognitive test : Symptom Rating Scales : Positive Negative Symptom Scale ( PANSS ) Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) Abnormal Involuntary Movements Scale ( AIMS ) ( examination ) Clinical Global Impressions—Severity Illness Scale ( CGI ) ( observational ) Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI-II ) Simpson-Angus Scale ( SAS ) Cognitive Battery : Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale ( select subtests ) ( WAIS-III ) North American Adult Reading Test ( NAART ) Stroop Test Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST ) California Verbal Learning Test ( CVLT ) Verbal Fluency ( FAS ) Finger Tapping CPT-IP Collection Blood Samples : Four tube blood drawn antecubital vein participant use EDTA non-EDTA vacutainers . Tubes label study , date , encrypt identification subject . Samples use DNA extraction measurement serum RBC folate homocysteine . Genetic Analysis : Genes study identified linkage study patient schizophrenia compel biology relevant potential mechanism etiology drug response . Approximately 20 candidate gene identify varying level evidence—this number rapidly expand . We review potential list candidate gene complete collect sample identify promising genotypic target analysis . If approve IRB , comparison population ( depressed patient nonpsychiatric control ) may perform collaboration investigator . Risks : While clinical assessment may stressful , question contain diagnostic instrument differ ask routine clinical evaluation . Phlebotomy may produce discomfort , bruising , rarely , infection . In theory , release genetic information patient could upset release party could represent serious breach privacy . Extensive precaution take prevent occurrence . All DNA analysis perform anonymous sample . Subject Remuneration : Subjects agree phlebotomy complete psychiatric evaluation remunerate $ 25 time . Subjects complete additional cognitive battery clinical rating scale remunerate total $ 50 time .</detailed_description>
