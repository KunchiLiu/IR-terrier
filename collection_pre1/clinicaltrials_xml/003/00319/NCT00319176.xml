	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism condition cause formation blood clot body . It may life threaten consequence leg vein , lung brain blood vessel involve . In pregnancy , woman 's baseline risk form blood clot increase . Women known prior blood clot pregnancy , artificial heart valves genetic condition high risk complication pregnancy . It well establish woman benefit medical treatment blood thin medication pregnancy prevent formation blood clot . These medication call Heparins give shot . Prior study suggest type Heparin call `` low molecular weight heparin '' ( Enoxaparin=Lovenox® ) well suit use pregnancy affect baby low complication rate . The standard dose give treatment patient establish previously . However , concern complication may occur concentration medication fall effective level . It particular importance pregnancy , rate breakdown medication increase pregnancy may lead lower effective level . Our study evaluate blood level enoxaparin administration medication pregnant woman receive drug treatment . This determine whether increase dose increase frequency dose might improve standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Pre-dose Post-dose Anti-factor Xa Levels With Enoxaparin Use During Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This prospective , non-blinded , pilot study gravid patient receive treatment dos enoxaparin therapy . Subjects Subjects include pregnant woman gestational age already receive treatment ( therapeutic ) dose regimen enoxaparin ( 1 mg/kg ± 20 % SC BID ) . Patients manage one principal co-investigators Long Beach Memorial Medical Center Women 's Hospital may readily identify potential candidate study . Additionally , perinatologist , obstetrician , resident physician prescribe enoxaparin patient may ask co-investigator consent woman study . Women individually counsel physician best antithrombotic drug therapy use pregnancy , case enoxaparin use , may ask participate study . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Nulliparous multiparous woman intrauterine pregnancy receive twice daily treatment dos enoxaparin ( 1 mg/kg ± 20 % SC BID ) . 2 . Subjects consent study . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Women pregnant . 2 . Women receive enoxaparin prophylactic dos ( i.e. , 30 mg twice daily 40 mg daily ) . 3 . Women currently receive another LMWH UFH . 4 . Women receive concomitant anticoagulant medication , warfarin , lepirudin , argatroban . 5 . Subjects unable unwilling give inform consent . 6 . Women , judgment investigator , would best interest patient participate study . Methods Women eligible consent participate study receive twice daily standard enoxaparin dose , prescribed physician . Enoxaparin ( Lovenox® ; Aventis Pharmaceuticals ) fill hospital 's inpatient pharmacy department Long Beach Memorial Medical Center , long subject admit hospital . If patient inpatient , patient 's nurse administer dos per hospital drug administration policy , subcutaneously 8:00 8:00 pm . Immediately prior receive fourth dose , anti-factor Xa level drawn - call `` pre-dose '' level . Waiting time period allow enoxaparin reach adequate steady-state level base average elimination half-life 4.5 hour ( range 3 6 hour ) . Three hour fourth dose enoxaparin administer , another anti-factor Xa level drawn - call `` 3-hour post-dose '' level . Eight hour fourth dose enoxaparin administer , anti-factor Xa level drawn well - call `` 8-hour post-dose '' level . The set level measure admission dosage adjustment . Enoxaparin dosage change make discretion treat physician . If patient outpatient , instruct adjust medication administration time time pre-dose , 3-hour post-dose , 8-hour post-dose level fall within day 's working hour . We also ensure drug steady state prior obtain blood sample verify least 3 dos medication . Blood obtain lab draw centrifuge 15 minute speed 3,000 g , temperature around 18ºC . Centrifugation perform within 1 hour sample collection . The plasma sample analyze batch anti-factor Xa activity amidolytic assay , do noon daily Long Beach Memorial 's Department Pathology ( Coagulation ) . If assay perform within 30 minute centrifugation , plasma frozen . Plasma sample may freeze 6 month . The minimum detectable limit assay 0.1 U/ml , linearity range extend 2.0 U/ml . Therapeutic anti-factor Xa activity designate 0.5-1.2 U/ml . The coefficient variation assay 98 % .13 Statistical Analysis : The plasma anti-factor Xa activity level measure study analyze compare incidence pre-dose post-dose level fall therapeutic anti-factor Xa activity range . The incidence therapeutic non-therapeutic anti-factor Xa post-dose level compare pre-dose level use Student 's t-test Fisher 's exact . If dose adjustment necessary , change make use traditional method post-dose level analysis . Mean time anti-factor Xa therapeutic range evaluate well . Subjects treat study intent-to-treat basis , data analyze . Anticoagulation therapy postpartum decide discretion treat physician .</detailed_description>
