	<criteria>Histological cytological diagnosis SCLC Extensive disease ( ED ) time study entry Response firstline platinumbased chemotherapy Recurrent progressive SCLC ≥90 day completion firstline therapy At least 18 year age ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 Measurable disease define RECIST criterion Measurable disease : The presence least one measurable lesion . If one lesion present , neoplastic nature disease site confirm histology and/or cytology . Measurable lesion : Lesions accurately measure least one dimension long diameter ≥20mm use conventional technique ≥10mm use spiral CT scan . CT ( include spiral CT ) scan MRI preferred method measurement ; however , chest xrays acceptable leions clearly define surround aerated lung . Clinically detected lesion consider measurable superficial ( eg. , skin nodule palpable lymph node ) . For case skin lesion , documentation color photography , include ruler estimate size lesion require . Adequate organ function include follow : Adequate bone marrow reserve : absolute neutrophil ( segmented band ) count ( ANC ) ≥1500 cells/μL , platelet count ≥100,000 cells/μL hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Hepatic : bilirubin ≤1.5 X ULN ; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤3.0 X ULN Renal : serum creatinine &lt; 2.0mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 60mL/min Cardiac : Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) ≥50 % Negative serum pregnancy test time enrollment woman childbearing potential . For men woman childproducing potential , use effective contraceptive method study . Ability understand requirement study , provide write informed consent authorization use disclosure protect health information , agree abide study restriction return required assessment Pregnant nursing woman Chest radiotherapy within previous 28 day radiotherapy within previous 14 day . Recovery acute toxic effect radiation require prior study enrollment . Measurable lesion previously irradiate must enlarge consider target lesion . Prior radiation therapy allow &lt; 25 % bone marrow .
