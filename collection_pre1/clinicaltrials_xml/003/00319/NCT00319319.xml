	<detailed_description>Mecamylamine Treatment Depression SSRI-Treated Partial Responders A . Purpose 1 . To compare nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine ( MEC ) placebo treatment depressive symptom nicotine-dependent , cigarette smoker non-smokers maintain , partial responder serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) . 2 . To determine effect MEC versus placebo cigarette smoke behavior SSRI-maintained depressed smoker non-smokers . B . Background The co-morbid rate nicotine dependence patient major depression estimate 50-60 % [ 1-3 ] . Smokers history major depression disorder great difficulty quit smoking compare smoker without history major depression [ 2 , 4 ] . Furthermore , smoker history depression appear substantial risk emergence depressive symptom exacerbation , typically within one month smoke cessation [ 2 , 5-7 ] , though phenomenon recently question [ 8 ] . Recent estimate nearly 45 % cigarette consume USA individual mental illness [ 10 ] . These clinical relationship tobacco use depression suggest important effect nicotine nicotinic receptor mechanism major depressive disorder . Thus , postulate nicotine cigarette smoking may exert antidepressant effect [ 4 , 5 , 11 , 12 ] , presumably mediate stimulation nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) system . In fact , show open-label trial nicotine patch could produce substantial antidepressant effect 3 day transdermal nicotine administration non-smoking subject major depression [ 12 ] . Based result several study , serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) show promise anti-smoking pharmacotherapies [ 5 , 9 ] . However , bupropion several SSRIs ( include fluoxetine , sertraline , fluvoxamine paroxetine ) show use vitro study bind , clinically relevant concentration , non-competitive ion channel site high-affinity nAChR [ 11 ] , site mecamylamine ( MEC ) bind . Since MEC show mood-enhancing effect control smoke cessation study examine combination MEC NTP [ 13 ] , recently mood-stabilizing property patient bipolar symptom [ 14 ] , speculate combination MEC SSRI may significant positive effect depressive symptom smoke . In on-going work Yale use transgenic mouse deletion alpha 2-subunit nAChR , Picciotto colleague demonstrate antidepressant effect tricyclic antidepressant amitriptyline learn helplessness model depression abolish alpha 2-subunit knock-out mouse ( lack functional high-affinity nAChRs contain alpha 2-subunit ) compare control background ( C57B/L ) mouse strain ( M.R . Picciotto , Ph.D. , personal communication ) . This finding suggest presence functional nAChRs necessary , sufficient , generation antidepressant response amitriptyline , antidepressant also show non-competitively inhibit high-affinity nAChRs [ 11 ] . Thus , since SSRIs MEC bind nAChRs since nAChRs may mediate effect clinically effective antidepressant , possible combination MEC SSRI may serve augment partial antidepressant response SSRIs , reduce drive smoke patient , either primarily secondarily . The current study proposes evaluate nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine ( Inversine® ) comparison match placebo , treatment depressive symptom smoker non-smokers major depressive disorder . These subject would maintain antidepressant treatment serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor , continue exhibit least mild depressive symptom ( e.g . partial antidepressant responder ) . The primary outcome measure depressive symptom end 12-week trial ( e.g . 50 % decrease depressive symptom ) compare baseline . Furthermore , compare effect mecamylamine versus placebo smoke behavior SSRI-maintained partial responder . C. Specific Location Study : The study conduct Program Research Smokers Mental Illness ( PRISM ) , Substance Abuse Center , Connecticut Mental Health Center ( CMHC ) , New Haven , CT. D. Probable Duration Project – ( 3/1/02-12/31/06 ) E. Research Plan Data Safety Monitoring Plan Study Medication : Mecamylamine hydrochloride market since 2000 FDA approve treatment hypertension . Mecamylamine HCI currently make Targacept , Inc. We purchase Mecamylamine study medication local pharmacy CMHC pharmacist make placebo capsule . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Have history major depression base SCID , currently maintain SSRI antidepressant dose change past three month . 2 . May history bipolar disorder , evidence manic hypomanic episode past year currently depressive phase Bipolar I II disorder . 3 . May history depression psychotic feature current evidence psychotic feature past year currently treat antipsychotic medication . 4 . Current depressive symptom assess mild moderate , Beck Depression Inventory score 10-30 . 5 . Capable give informed consent . 6 . For smoke subject , meet DSM-IV criterion nicotine dependence , smoke least 15 cigarettes/day , biochemically verify . 7 . For smoke subject , intention quit smoking . 8 . Adults age 18-65 . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . A history alcohol drug dependence abuse six month prior study entry . 2 . A history schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder , currently treat antipsychotic medication . 3 . A history manic psychotic episode within past year . 4 . Currently treat antidepressant SSRIs . 5 . Presence suicidal homicidal ideation time study entry , and/or evidence significant impairment function would necessitate treatment subject non-outpatient setting . 6 . If female , currently pregnant ( assessed urine pregnancy test baseline appropriate thereafter ) , plan become pregnant course trial . 7 ) Current history glaucoma ( open- close angle ) , prostatic hypertrophy , urethral obstruction , cerebral arteriosclerosis pyloric stenosis.. 8 ) A history hypotension ( e.g . systolic blood pressure le 90mm Hg ) . 9 ) A history know contraindication Mecamylamine ( Inversine ) 10 ) For smoker , currently take bupropion ( either Wellbutrin Zyban preparation ) nicotine replacement therapy , currently involve smoke cessation behavioral therapy . Study Design : Subjects history major depression partially responsive SSRI either dependent cigarette smoker ( N=30 ) non-smokers ( N=30 ) recruit study . The study design 2 ( smoke status ) x 2 ( study medication ) configuration 8 week . Treatments Groups : Smoker Subjects : 1 . Placebo ( Placebo tablet , one po bid , N=15 ) 2 . Mecamylamine ( 10.0 mg/day 5 mg po bid ; N=15 ) Non-Smoker Subjects : 3 . Placebo ( Placebo tablet , one po bid , N=15 ) 4 . Mecamylamine ( 10.0 mg/day ; 5.0 mg po bid , N=15 ) Subjects begin MEC Week 2 0.0/5.0 mg qd ( 2 tablet po qd ) , increase 0.0/5.0 mg po bid ( 2 tablet po bid ) Day 8 trial ( Week 2 ) . Study medication continue end Week 8 . If subject find study medication , mecamylamine , helpful , information share subject ’ physician enable decision whether mecamylamine continue study , since available prescription subject ’ physician . Both smoker non-smoker participant would receive supportive therapy intervention treatment . G. Economic Considerations : Subjects would pay $ 25.00 completion baseline assessments $ 25.00 successful completion 8-week trial . Thus , subject could earn $ 50.00 study participation . III . HUMAN SUBJECTS A . Subject Population , Recruitment : A total 60 smoking ( n=30 ) non-smoking ( n=30 ) subject current depressed treat serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) recruit . B . Source Research Material : Study medication ( Mecamylamine 2.5 mg ) purchase local pharmacy . Placebo medication prepare CMHC pharmacist use encapsulation . C. Consent Procedures : Subjects recruit participation provide write consent form require signature . Only subject capable give informed consent score 80 % post-consent test admit study . D. Risks : The primary risk study associate study medication , mecamylamine . Side effect associate mecamylamine include constipation , dry mouth , nausea vomiting , orthostatic hypotension ( dizziness standing ) , rarely , unusual muscle movement seizure . In experience , constipation appear common side effect . Because study medication , mecamylamine , may cause drop blood pressure , plan monitor subject ’ blood pressure ( sit stand ) weekly basis . If subject develop systolic blood pressure &lt; 100mm Hg , plan monitor blood pressure twice weekly . If subject develop systolic blood &lt; 90mm Hg , plan discontinue study medication . Lastly , subject experience systolic blood pressure drop &gt; 10mm Hg , plan monitor twice weekly problem resolve . In addition , exclude potential subject history glaucoma , prostatic hypertrophy , urethral obstruction , cerebral arteriosclerosis , pyloric stenosis , history hypersensitivity mecamylamine . There rare chance smoking subject quit smoking study , subject could worsen depressive symptom . E. Protection Subjects : All report generate data obtain study protect confidentiality subject participate study . In case medical emergency , medication group blind break principal investigator . If depress subject show clinical deterioration , Dr. George Ms. Vessicchio determine : 1 ) whether subject remain study , ; 2 ) whether high level care need . G. Confidentiality : All report generate study contain identify information participant .</detailed_description>
