	<brief_title>Effects Age Exercise Blood Pressure Regulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study do find age , activity level , presence heart disease affect way body control blood pressure . A total 80 individual recruit study , consist two group : sedentary healthy individual coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Each group undergo screen test , include history , questionnaire , physical exam , lab test , treadmill exercise tolerance test , maximal exercise test . These screen test repeat 3 month 6 month . The study involve 20 visit 6-month period . An exercise-training program design individual 's fitness level . During first month , individual supervise exercise Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital , may choose exercise home fitness center . These exercise session take place 3-5 time per week 15-40 minute per session base individual 's exercise program , increase 4-6 time per week 30-60 minute per session first month . Participants require visit Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital minimum every two week information collect heart rate monitor . Testing do begin end exercise-training intervention period determine effect intervention individual 's blood pressure regulation . This test consist 2 sequential study day . During first day 's testing , last 2 hour , participant receive 8 low dos atropine alter vagal effect . On second day , take 4 hour , participant receive sodium nitroprusside , phenylephrine , low-dose atropine sympathetic nervous activity record . Differences blood pressure regulation pre- post-training study .</detailed_description>
