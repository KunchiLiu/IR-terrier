	<brief_title>REPEAT Study - Resistance ErythroPoietin Effectiveness Algorithm Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Rationale Many treatable cause erythropoietin resistance ( also know erythropoietin hypo-responsiveness ) exist patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) stag 3 5 . Well recognize cause erythropoietin resistance include iron deficiency , severe hyperparathyroidism , chronic infection , vitamin deficiency , aluminum toxicity poor dialysis adequacy . Furthermore , many disease result chronic inflammatory state also associate erythropoietin resistance Non-CKD patient diseases chronic congestive heart failure , chronic liver disease many connective tissue disease include rheumatoid arthritis systemic lupus . It well recognize CKD stage 5 patient receive dialysis may also risk develop chronic inflammation result severe syndrome characterize malnutrition resistance exogenous erythropoietin replacement therapy . Markers chronic inflammatory state observe dialysis patient include hypoalbuminemia , elevate C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , elevate ferritin , increase serum amyloid A low transferrin saturation . In addition , pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , tumour necrosis factor alpha ( TNF-alpha ) interleukin 1 ( IL-1 ) show vivo suppress erythroid colony form unit . Erythrocyte lifespan also shorten increased clearance macrophage activate inflammatory signal immunoglobulin coat erythrocyte . Inflammation also affect iron metabolism many level . Inflammatory cytokine lead reduce serum concentration iron transferrin . Reduction transferrin lead decrease iron absorption via gut . Lactoferrin polymorphonuclear cell act iron scavenger bactericidal activity . Lactoferrin level show increase inflammation bind large amount free iron , thereby reduce overall availability . Functional iron deficiency , also characteristic inflammatory state associate erythropoietin resistance define low availability iron erythropoiesis despite normal high iron store . Functional iron deficiency occur two way ; high dos exogenous erythropoietin stimulate erythropoiesis exceed capacity deliver adequate iron alternatively , delivery iron reticuloendothelial system hematopoietic cell block . Both mechanism may occur patient chronic inflammation erythropoietin resistance . Erythropoietin resistance define several way . In study analyze Eprex® use , author utilize dose cut point &gt; 200units Eprex®/kg/week reasonable marker 'true ' erythropoietin resistance , erythropoietin resistance occur obvious cause contribute poor Eprex® response . Other author use dose cut point &gt; 300units /kg/week define erythropoietin resistance . Furthermore , measure erythropoietin resistance call Eprex® dose hematocrit ratio ( Eprex®/Hct ) use continuous variable study show positively correlate certain marker erythropoietin resistance . Markers erythropoietin resistance dialysis patient study . Previous study show CRP level great 20mg/L associate Eprex® resistance dialysis patient . Other marker include low albumin , high fibrinogen , low transferrin high ferritin . Other novel marker inflammation plasma N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline , procalcitonin , fetuin neopterin also study . The true prevalence Eprex® resistance know Canada . It estimate approximately 10 % base early Eprex® therapy trial . The Canadian Nephrology Practice Patterns Study ( CNPPS ) , collect data large subset Canadian dialysis patient 1995 1998 provide estimate . Several author analyze CNPPS data apply Eprex® resistance measure study population . Using dose cut point &gt; 200units/kg/week Eprex® , author find prevalence Eprex® resistance 15.7 % hemodialysis ( HD ) patient 5.5 % peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient . Further analysis use Eprex®/Hct measure show significant negative correlation Eprex®/Hct serum albumin HD PD patient . Body mass index ( BMI ) also positively correlate Eprex®/Hct group . This study also find dose cut &gt; 200units/kg/week utilized measure exogenous erythropoietin resistance , 15 % HD patient cut point utilize 34 % Eprex® administer HD patient study period . Similarly , 5.5 % Eprex® resistant PD patient require 16.2 % Eprex® give PD patient period . Little known optimal way manage 'true ' erythropoietin resistance erythropoietin hypo-responsiveness . Traditionally , nephrologists overcome erythropoietin resistance prescribe large escalate Eprex® dos prolong period time . There minimal data suggests optimal way manage patient . There publish protocol study systematic increase decrease Eprex® patient . Furthermore , study safety use high dose Eprex® prolong period time . It know whether dose ceiling beyond Eprex® longer pharmacologically effective exists patient 'true ' Eprex® resistance . Studies cost effectiveness high dose Eprex® therapy Eprex® resistant patient limited . Patients Eprex® resistance may able maintain hemoglobin level reduce dose Eprex® , evidence efficacy safety Eprex® dose reduction protocol limit small open-label study . In contradistinction , perhaps escalate Eprex® dos maximum dose well recommended clinical practice guideline target require improve hemoglobin level patient .</detailed_description>
