	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES Primary Objective : To assess overall response rate ( complete partial response ) Abraxane patient recurrent metastatic head neck cancer addition Cetuximab disease progression . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To assess frequency severity toxicity associate treatment . 2 . To evaluate overall survival progression-free survival patient recurrent metastatic head neck cancer treat single agent Abraxane . 3.To ass whether addition Centuximab re-sensitize head neck cancer Abraxane progression single agent Abraxane . BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Approximately 40,000 new case head neck cancer diagnose annually United States ( Jemal et al , 2003 ) , 30 % patient expect die malignancy . Squamous cell carcinoma account 90 % head neck cancer case . Although metastatic disease time diagnosis rather uncommon , despite aggressive use up-front concurrent radiation cisplatin-based chemotherapy , approximately 20 % patient develop metastasis . Patients recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) poor prognosis . Their median survival 6-8 month . Selected patient locally recurrent disease treat curative intent locoregional therapy , salvage surgery radiation ( De Crevoisier et al , 1998 ) ; however majority patient die disease . Despite high response rate , combination chemotherapy show produce survival benefit compare single agent randomize trial patient recurrent/metastatic head neck cancer ( Forastiere et al , 1992 ; Jacobs et al , 1992 ; Clavel et al , 1994 ) . A phase III randomize study conduct SWOG compare cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy single agent methotrexate ( Forastiere et al , 1992 ) . The objective response rate 32 % , 21 % , 10 % , cisplatin/5-Fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , carboplatin/5-FU , single methotrexate , respectively , median overall survival statistically different three arm ( range 5 6.6 month ) . Moreover , toxicity increase combination therapy , especially cisplatin-based regimen . Another randomize study conduct US demonstrate significantly high response rate 32 % combination cisplatin 5-FU versus 17 % 13 % single agent cisplatin 5-FU , respectively ( Jacobs et al , 1992 ) . However , median survival patient 5.7 month , difference three arm . Hematologic toxicity increase combination arm . A subsequent randomized study conduct ECOG ( E1393 ) compare high-dose paclitaxel ( 200 mg/m2 ) 24-hour infusion plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 G-CSF support , low dose paclitaxel ( 135 mg/m2 ) 24-hour infusion , plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 ( Forastiere et al , 2001 ) . Patients newly diagnose metastatic recurrent squamous cell carcinoma head neck , exclude nasopharyngeal primary eligible . No prior treatment recurrent/metastatic disease allow , patient could receive chemotherapy part initial curative therapy complete 6 month prior study . Tow hundred ten patient randomize 2 arm . No significant difference outcome observe . The response rate 35 % vs 36 % median survival 7.6 v 6.8 month , high-dose v low-dose paclitaxel arm respectively . Patients metastatic disease perform bad term survival . Previously untreated patient achieve high response rate 58 % compare response rate 32 % observed patient fail prior curative therapy . Substantial toxicity observe trial . Grade 4 neutropenia see 61-71 % patient febrile neutropenia hospitalization occur 27-39 % patient . The toxic death rate 10 % ( 12 % vs 9 % ) ( Forastiere et al , 2001 ) . It conclude 24-hour paclitaxel infusion associate unacceptable toxicity combine cisplatin . Instead , 3-hour paclitaxel infusion combine cisplatin advanced testing . A recent randomized trial conduct ECOG ( E1395 ) compare combination paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 3-hour infusion cisplatin 75 mg/m2 standard cisplatin 5-FU regimen . No statistically significant difference could demonstrate either response rate survival two arm ( Murphy et al , 2001 ) . This study , however , indicate paclitaxel , member taxane class anti-tumor agent , active head neck cancer . Recently , another member anti-tumor class taxane , Docetaxel ( Taxotere ) show active advanced head neck cancer . In randomized phase III trial intensification induction chemotherapy follow radiation , addition docetaxel induction regimen cisplatin 5-fluoruracil compare cisplatin 5-fluoruracil alone result 3-month improvement overall survival ( Vermorken et al , 2004 ) . Thus member taxane family , paclitaxel docetaxel , proven anti-tumor activity head neck cancer . New agent treat head neck cancer need investigate . Abraxane , albumin-bound formulation paclitaxel show significant single-agent activity breast cancer head neck cancer . Recently , Abraxane approve use metastatic breast cancer . Given previous randomized phase III trial indicate single agent chemotherapy fare well combination chemotherapy regimen term overall survival , novel formulation actively investigate head neck cancer . Abraxane solid tumor The clinical database include two single arm study enrol total 106 patient one multi-center randomize trial . The multi-center trial conduct 460 patient metastatic breast cancer randomize receive either Abraxane 260 mg/m² administer 30-minute infusion paclitaxel 175 mg/m² give 3 hour . Sixty-four percent patient impair performance status ( ECOG 1 2 ) study entry . Seventy-nine percent visceral metastasis 76 % &gt; 3 site metastasis . Fifty-nine percent patient receive one prior chemotherapy regimen , 77 % receive anthracycline-containing regimen . The objective response rate verify central review 21.5 % ( 95 % CI : 16.2 % 26.7 % ) Abraxane compare 11.1 % ( 95 % CI : 6.9 % 15.1 % ) paclitaxel ( p=0.003 ) . The conclusion phase III trial Abraxane statistically significant high target lesion response rate ( trial primary endpoint ) ( O'Shaughnessy et al , 2003 ) . On January 7 , 2005 U. S. Food Drug Administration approve Abraxane ( albumin-bound paclitaxel ) treatment breast cancer failure combination chemotherapy metastatic disease relapse within 6 month adjuvant chemotherapy base statistically significant superior response rate randomize phase III trial mention . The recommend dose Abraxane 260 mg/m² administer intravenously 30 minute every 3 week . No premedication prevent hypersensitivity reaction require prior Abraxane administration . Abraxane Head Neck Cancer The role Abraxane Head Neck cancer explore phase I study ( Damascelli et al , 2001 ) . Abraxane inject intra-arterially ( carotid artery ) 31 patient advanced Head Neck cancer . The maximum tolerated dose single administration determine 270 mg/m2 close approve dose 260 mg/m2 . Three patient achieve complete response 19 patient achieve partial response combine response rate 76 % . Side effect tolerable include three patient grade 4 neutropenia , grade 2 non-hematologic toxicity include : keratitis [ 1 patient ] , skin toxicity [ 5 patient ] , neurologic toxicity [ 4 patient ] , flu-like syndrome [ 7 patient ] . However , intra-arterial administration technically challenge potential serious side effect , cumbersome conventional way deliver chemotherapy . In another phase 1 study Abraxane advance solid tumor , 3 5 patient nasopharyngeal carcinoma response last 25 , 18 13+ week ( Teng et al , 2005 ) . Given hint anti-tumor activity Abraxane advance Head Neck cancer mention study , current study seek determine efficacy Abraxane recurrent metastatic head neck cancer dose 260 mg/m2 give intravenously every 3 week systemic manner . Abraxane FDA approve treatment study disease ; however , approve patient use treatment advance breast cancer fail traditional therapy . Abraxane natural substance far superior conventional chemistry . Abraxane effective treatment aggressive cancer adversely affect process cell division prevent restructuring . Other cell also affect adversely , since cancer cell divide much faster non-cancerous cell , far susceptible Abraxane treatment , thus , safety drug less chemotherapy regimen . Human albumin use along Abraxane . Description Cetuximab ( IMC-225 ) ( Erbitux ) ( NSC-714692 ) Cetuximab , chimerized antibody IgG1 subclass originally derive mouse myeloma cell line . The chimerization result antibody bind affinity epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) great natural ligand epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) . Cetuximab block bind EGF transform growth factor ( TGFa ) EGFR inhibit ligand-induced activation tyrosine kinase receptor . Cetuximab also stimulate EGFR internalization , effectively remove receptor cell surface interaction ligand . Safety Precaution Cetuximab therapy use caution patient know hypersensitivity Cetuximab , murine protein , component product . Administration Cetuximab : In effort prevent hypersensitivity reaction , patient premedicated dexamethasone 20 mg IV diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50 mg IV give 30-60 minute prior infusion cetuximab . The initial/loading dose cetuximab 400 mg/m2 IV administer 120 minute . Patients must continuously observed infusion sign anaphylaxis standard resuscitative med close proximity . Vital sign take prior , , post 1-hour post infusion initial dose . For subsequent infusion , vital sign recommend take 1-hour post infusion . Following load dose , patient receive weekly treatment cetuximab IV 60 minute . The infusion rate cetuximab never exceed 5 mL/min . Patients closely monitor treatment-related adverse event , especially hypersensitivity reaction , infusion post-infusion . Cetuximab use treatment patient advanced head neck cancer spread part body .</detailed_description>
