	<brief_summary>Aplastic anemia rare autoimmune disorder bone marrow production blood cell greatly decrease absent . Symptoms include fatigue , weakness , tiny reddish-purple mark skin , abnormal bruising , bleed gum , nose , intestine . While case aplastic anemia cause medication , toxic exposure , inherit gene , often cause remain unknown . The purpose study determine safety efficacy combine two drug , sirolimus cyclosporine , treat individual aplastic anemia respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sirolimus Cyclosporine Treatment-Resistant Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The successful treatment aplastic anemia bone marrow transplantation . However , patient eligible procedure . For others , treatment usually consist immunosuppressive agent , antithymocyte globulin ( ATG ) cyclosporine . Unfortunately , even immunosuppressive therapy , relapse common . New combination medication may offer alternative effective treatment option . Sirolimus cyclosporine two drug routinely use suppress immune system prevent rejection patient receive organ transplant . While cyclosporine proven effective treat aplastic anemia , sirolimus test disease . This study evaluate safety efficacy sirolimus combination cyclosporine treat individual aplastic anemia respond treatment . This study last least 6 month . Participants first screen verify diagnosis aplastic anemia . The screen include physical examination , blood test , bone marrow biopsy pelvic bone , review medication medical history . Individuals eligible start first treatment period . Participants receive two medication : cyclosporine take twice day sirolimus take day . Depending side effect , dose either drug may temporarily stop lower . On Day 1 , blood drawn female undergo pregnancy test . Subsequent study visit occur weekly first month , every 2 week 2 month , month remainder study . Each visit include physical examination , vital sign assessment , review side effect medication . Blood test perform weekly first 3 week , every 2 week . After 6 month treatment , participant show improvement disease status without major side effect , treatment continue . Over time dos may lower . If participant improve study medication , treatment stop 6 month . Whenever treatment discontinue , participant undergo physical examination , blood test , bone marrow biopsy .</detailed_description>
