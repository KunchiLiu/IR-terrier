	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) randomize ( study drug assign chance ) study evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety , tolerability , efficacy , antiviral activity , immunology resistance characteristic TMC114 ritonavir treatment-experienced , HIV-1 infect child adolescent participant . The study consist 3 period : Screening period ( maximum 4 week ) ; Treatment period ( maximum 48 week ) ; Follow-up period ( 4 week ) . The Treatment period consist two part : Part-1 pediatric dose selection Part-2 recommendation pediatric adult dose . Part-1 divide two group : Group A adult equivalent dose TMC114 ritonavir twice daily Group B 20-33 percent high dose TMC114 ritonavir twice daily . The recommend dose select base short-term safety , tolerability , antiviral activity pharmacokinetics Week 2 . Once select , Part-1 participant select dose switch select dose next visit continue study 48 week Part-2 . Participants less equal 18 year Week 48 visit , continue benefit treatment TMC114 living country TMC114 pediatric use yet part label , opportunity roll-over extension phase continue receive TMC114/ritonavir participant become 18 year TMC114 available local Health Care Systems TMC114 indicate use pediatrics .
