	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess survival patient treat Litx™ versus standard care therapy treatment unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , demonstrate safety Litx™ therapy . Litx™ consist light-activated drug , talaporfin sodium ( LS11 , Light Sciences Oncology , Bellevue , Washington ) , light generate device , compose light-emitting diode ( LEDs ) , energized power controller percutaneously place target tissue inside body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Study Talaporfin Sodium Interstitial Light Emitting Diodes Treating Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients provide Informed Consent satisfy Eligibility Criteria place eligibility pool randomization either Litx™ treatment arm standard care arm . A Patient assign Litx™ treatment group may receive three Litx™ treatment . Regardless group patient assign treatment planning anticipate ablation lesion three Litx™ treatment use 4 Light Sources per treatment ( single Light Source may kill 2 cm x 4 cm tissue ) . The Litx™ treatment group undergo CT Ultrasound guide percutaneous placement single , two , three , four Light Sources depend tumor characteristic . No 4 Light Sources use single treatment . The Light Source ( ) may use single lesion multiple lesion . Following image confirmation Light Source placement , patient receive intravenous dose LS11 1 mg/kg . Fifteen minute one hour follow completion LS11 administration , delivery 200 J/cm per Light Source 20 mW/cm light energy begin . The Light Source manually remove patient observed complication Light Source removal . Precautions protection external light exposure institute begin LS11 administration maintain two week . Patients designated standard care group , receive current standard care treatment recommend investigate physician . Should elect treatment fail , patient may switch another standard care treatment . A patient designate Litx™ treatment group may receive two additional Litx™ treatment . A second third treatment Litx™ may consider residual tumor new tumor exists . The third treatment must take place within six month first treatment . A patient may switch receive standard care third Litx™ treatment recommend investigator necessary . For either Litx™ group standard care group treatment therapy exhaust patient follow survival . No protocol-directed office visit require period patient may follow phone and/or e-mail four week interval . All patient monitor survival time randomization time death cause least 142 death observe , whichever occur first .</detailed_description>
