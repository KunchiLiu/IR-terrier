It routinely use adjunct x-ray mammography clinical examination , young patient may sole image modality . It well-established value differentiate malignant benign solid lesion case , however , replace fine needle aspiration core biopsy . Conventional breast US scan highly operator- dependent , require skillful probe manipulation mental ability envisage 3-D tissue structure . Acquiring 3-D US data set may advantageous , make easy see interpret 3-D structure , boundary interaction . CBUS™ , Circular Breast Ultrasound Scanner indicate improve significantly breast image obtain ultrasound system . The CBUS™ system automatically acquire complete breast image construct high quality 3D image scan breast . These image provide diagnostic information complete volume breast tissue include blood flow single ultrasonic 3D image . In clinical study , CBUS™ Circular Breast Ultrasound Scanner use automatically image complete breast provide high quality 3D image scan breast .</brief_summary>
