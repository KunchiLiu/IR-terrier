	<brief_title>Immunosuppression Patients Undergoing Liver Transplantation Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There two major issue face patient underwent liver transplantation hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . First , patient require adequate immunosuppressive medication avoid rejection allograft . Second , risk HCC recurrence reduce minimum . To date , wide spread argument immunosuppressive agent reduction allograft rejection generally tumorogenic , least permissive cancer development although little known tumorogenic effect . In clinical study substantiate experimental data , cyclosporin ( CsA ) enhance cancer cell growth characteristic angiogenesis tumor inhibit DNA repair mechanism , promote growth . In experimental rat-model CsA promote liver tumor recurrence growth . In experimental study high proliferation rate human hepatoma cell presence tacrolimus demonstrate . Nevertheless immunosuppressive agent necessarily promote tumor growth , fact , antineoplastic activity . Sirolimus , immunosuppressive dos , potent antiangiogenic property inhibit tumor growth . The antiangiogenetic mechanism due inhibition vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) production signal endothelial cell . Besides , sirolimus directly block critical intracellular pathway ( mTOR ) inhibit cell-cycle . Through increase E-cadherin expression tumor cell , tumor metastasis reduce increased tumor cell bind . In context mention mouse model transplant recipient also tumor , pro-tumor effect CsA completely negate sirolimus . Especially HCC seem particularly sensitive VEGF/angiogenesis , indicate potential susceptibility action sirolimus could show group E.K . Geissler colleague Regensburg . From clinical perspective recent pilot study Kneteman et al . indicate early conversion immunosuppression CNI mTOR-inhibitors OLT HCC patient ( n=21 ) `` high risk '' tumor recurrence result tumor recurrence rate 19 % 4-year survival 83 % group . Moreover , `` low-risk '' group ( n=19 ) 4-year tumor recurrence rate 1/19 . Post-HCC recurrence survival 15.5 month , mark improvement compare currently publish data . Although study report small number patient control , suggest potential role sirolimus ameliorate tumor recurrence , lead benign course renew tumor disease . Among serious complication immunosuppressive therapy organ transplantation high risk previous neoplasia recurrence , development de novo cancer . HCC comprise 80-90 % malignancy indicate OLT . Before introduction strict criterion enrollment primary liver tumor , tumor recurrence lead poor mid- long-term result . HCC thus unacceptable recurrence rate follow OLT tumor exceed 5 cm size . ELTR data 2003 show 5 year patient overall survival hepatic malignancy ( include 80 % HCC group since 1997 ) merely 53 % , compare poorly data non-cholestatic liver cirrhosis 74 % even acute liver failure 62 % . Based previous work , landmark publication 1996 Mazzaferro et al . many center restrict indication liver transplantation due clinical criterion base tumor size number so-called ´Milan Criteria´ . Implementing criterion , recent single center data show improvement disease-free overall survival follow OLT HCC . Nevertheless approximately 30 % patient study think within Milan Criteria transplantation , prove histopathological examination extend disease . This lead dramatic decline overall disease-free survival , 71-85 % 40-50 % , 65-78 % 27-30 % , respectively . In total preclinical clinical observation lead u purpose use sirolimus HCC patient could improve survival liver transplantation decrease tumor recurrence rate . Thus patient experience less posttransplant problem HCC recurrence , therefore could expect long , good quality life .</detailed_description>
