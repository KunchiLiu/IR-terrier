	<brief_title>Recovery Hand Function Through Mental Practice .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke common highly debilitate illness . Many patient ( 41-45 % ) experience chronic motor impairment ( Dijkerman et al. , 1996 ) limitation activity daily live ( Wade &amp; Langton Hewer , 1987 ) even extensive neurological rehabilitation . They often result long-term dependence considerable cost carers health service . It therefore crucial optimise motor recovery stroke . This study investigate therapeutic benefit motor imagery training stroke patient motor weakness . Evidence idea motor imagery training could enhance recovery hand function come several separate base evidence : sport literature ; neurophysiological evidence ; evidence health psychology research ; well preliminary finding use motor imagery technique stroke patient . There evidence suggest mental rehearsal movement produce effect normally attribute practise actual movement . Imagining hand movement could stimulate redistribution brain activity , accompany recovery hand function , thus result reduce motor deficit . Patients assess four-week evaluation period . In randomised control trial 45 patient daily mentally rehearse movement affect hand close supervision . Their recovery compare 45 patient perform closely supervise non-motor mental rehearsal , 45 patient engaged train program .</detailed_description>
