	<brief_summary>With alarm increase prevalence obesity , identify factor predispose individual weight-gain critical importance . Even caloric intake physical activity level well control , susceptibility weight-gain heterogeneous . Basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) represent large portion daily energy expenditure normal adult , , variability BMR among individual major factor determine susceptibility gain weight . However , factor responsible variability BMR resistance weight-gain remain unclear . Our preliminary data indicate high-normal growth hormone ( GH ) concentration associate resistance weight-gain rat overfed great weight-loss human underfed . In addition , investigator find pulsatility GH secretion profound effect several metabolic process . Therefore , together finding suggest endogenous GH secretion associate body weight regulation , pulsatility ( peak amplitude ) GH secretion , rather absolute GH concentration , per se , may responsible effect . Because GH influence many key metabolic process contribute BMR ( e.g . ; protein synthesis , proteolysis , substrate cycling ) , investigator anticipate resistance weight-gain person elevate GH concentration associate increase BMR due acceleration process . Our overall hypothesis increase GH secretion protect weight-gain due augmentation major metabolic process contribute BMR . Identifying factor responsible predisposing individual weight-gain lead establish improve method reduce prevalence obesity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The susceptibility gain weight highly variable even caloric intake physical activity well control . Because basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) represent ~70 % total daily energy expenditure ( TDEE ) , even small difference BMR affect daily energy balance , thereby increase susceptibility gain weight . Our preliminary data indicate high-normal growth hormone ( GH ) secretion associate resistance weight-gain rat overfed great weight-loss human underfed . Given GH influence many key metabolic process contribute BMR , investigator hypothesize person high-normal GH resistant weight-gain high BMR , result accelerate rate process . The investigator measure basal 24h GH secretion BMR 106 non-obese men woman . The investigator also measure protein synthesis , proteolysis , triglyceride/fatty acid cycling ( measure use stable isotope tracer method ) determine relationship among process , BMR , GH [ Specific Aim 1 ] . Subjects identify `` low-normal '' ( &lt; 1.5 ug/L ) `` high-normal '' ( &gt; 3 ug/L ) 24h GH admit hospital 2 wk overfeed protocol ( ~2000 kcal/d &gt; TDEE - restrict physical activity ) , immediately follow 4 wk caloric restriction protocol ( ~750 kcal/d &lt; TDEE ) compare change weight , body composition intra-abdominal adiposity group differ markedly GH secretion ( GH measure diet ) [ Specific Aim 2 ] . A subset subject low-normal GH receive intravenous GH throughout 2 wk overfeed period either : 1. constant rate 2. pulsatile infusion ( mimic endogenous secretion ) . BMR assess daily protein synthesis , proteolysis , triglyceride/fatty acid cycling measure end 2 wks [ Specific Aim 3 ] . The investigator anticipate high GH pulsatility ( peak amplitude ) , rather elevate GH concentration , per se , increase protein synthesis , proteolysis , triglyceride/fatty acid cycling resultant increase BMR resistance weight-gain . Identifying factor responsible predisposing individual weight-gain help combat alarm rise prevalence obesity .</detailed_description>
