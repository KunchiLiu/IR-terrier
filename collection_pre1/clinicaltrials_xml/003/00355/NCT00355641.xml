Have diagnosis primary RLS use International RLS Study Group ( IRSSG ) Diagnostic Criteria ( Appendix 10 ) , experience RLS symptom even ( 8 PM ) nighttime , total score ≥15 IRLS Rating Scale Baseline . Subjects must history minimum 20 evenings/nights RLS episode per month ( e.g. , combination evening and/or night ≥ 20 day ) . During Screening/Washout , RLS symptom must present least 4 7 evenings/nights immediately prior Baseline Visit ( e.g. , combination evening and/or night ≥ 4 day ) . Subjects must give write informed consent prior specific study procedure . Subjects medical condition , opinion investigator , could affect efficacy assessment clinically significant unstable medical condition present safety concern . These may include , limited follow disorder : diabetes , peripheral neuropathy , rheumatoid arthritis , fibromyalgia syndrome , symptomatic orthostatic hypotension , severe cardiovascular disease , hepatic renal failure , pleuropulmonary fibrosis . Subjects clinically significant abnormal laboratory ECG find resolve time baseline examination . Abnormal 12lead ECG finding include , limited following : myocardial ischemia , clinically significant conduction abnormality , clinically significant arrhythmia . Subjects diastolic blood pressure ≥ 110mmHg ≤ 50mmHg systolic blood pressure ≥ 180mmHg ≤ 90mmHg Screening Baseline visit . Subjects history augmentation and/or endofdose rebound symptom . Augmentation define RLS symptom occur treatment occur ≥ 2 hour earlier , symptom severe treat , symptom start less time rest treatment , symptom involve part body , arm trunk . Endofdose rebound define reemergence RLS symptom early morning day take dose RLS medication . Subjects exhibit intolerance ropinirole . For subject enter Study 206 , certain medication must discontinue prior enter study . The following medication prohibit duration study period include Followup visit : ·dopamine agonist ( include ropinirole immediate release formulation ) , dopamine antagonist ( e.g. , typical neuroleptic , metoclopramide ) , levodopa/carbidopa The minimum discontinuation period generally 5 halflives 7 consecutive evening/nights medicationfree , prior baseline , whichever long period . If subject require longer 2 week follow Followup visit parent study complete washout , GSK must consult instruction . Other medication , include partial dopaminergic activity ( e.g. , atypical antipsychotic , certain antidepressant bupropion , tricyclic antidepressant monoamine oxidase inhibitor ) may additive activity ropinirole use caution patient take ropinirole . For patient stable dos , agent may permit ; however , recommend dose medication remain stable throughout duration study . Night worker others whose sleep habit incompatible study design , would require make significant change bedtime course study . Women positive pregnancy test .
