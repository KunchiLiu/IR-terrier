	<brief_title>Comparative Study Intragastric Balloon Pharmacotherapy Non-Morbid Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity chronic devastate disease become major health socioeconomic issue worldwide . Obesity significantly exacerbate many chronic illness increase mortality morbidity patients.1-2 Although situation Asians le apparent critical Caucasians , problem emerge rapidly . In Hong Kong , approximately 29 % adult classify obese accord WHO Asian criterion 3 increase demand obesity treatment Asia-Pacific region.4 The first practical aim treat obesity nowadays focus sustain body weight loss 10-15 % alleviate obesity-related illness hypertension , diabetes obstructive sleep apnoea . Intragastric balloon ( IGB ) initially develop observe effect naturally cause bezoars first documentation human use report 1982.5 However , early balloon design plague high balloon failure rate serious complications.6-8 Since , balloon design undergone several major modification term material , shape filling substance . The new design balloon ( Bioenterics® Intragastric Balloon ( BIB® ) system ) introduce 1999 9 undergone extensive evaluation recently Europe promise results.10-11 It place inside stomach endoscopically maximum 180 day decrease stomach capacity gastric emptying . It facilitate patient ’ compliance restrict diet prescribe together increase level physical activity , report show moderate body weight loss 15 % more.10 -- 12 More importantly , new design balloon ( BIB ) reliable predictable . The reported premature balloon rupture serious complication rare remove within recommended period follow carefully dedicate obesity team multidisciplinary approach.10-12 Sibutramine ( Reductil® ) serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor one FDA approve weight reduction pharmacotherapy . Its central action neurotransmitter cause enhancement satiety ( fullness ) eating . In addition , cause sympathetically mediate thermogenesis , prevent reduction basal metabolic rate ( BMR ) normally see individual restrict diet thereby effectively increase rest energy consumption promotes weight loss . A combination sibutramine lifestyle modification program show 10 % body weight loss intragastric balloon sibutramine two commonly use non-surgical method weight reduction . There lack randomize control trial compare two method treatment obesity . Since two type therapy efficient non-morbid obese patient , design trial compare effect two different weight reduction therapy group patient double-blind manner .</detailed_description>
