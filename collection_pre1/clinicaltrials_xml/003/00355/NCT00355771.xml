	<detailed_description>Levocetirizine 5 mg well establish treatment seasonal perennial rhinoconjunctivitis . This study design , investigate efficacy patient suffer persistent allergic rhinitis define ARIA ( Allergic Rhinitis Impact Asthma ) work group WHO . The study divide 8 ± 2 day screen 56 ± 3 day treatment phase . During period patient keep diary reporting severity nasal ocular complaint , use rescue medication ( cromoglycate eye drop nasal spray ) , concomitant medication adverse event . They apply 0 3 point score ( 0 = , 1= mild , 2 = moderate , 3 = severe symptom ) rate nasal obstruction , rhinorrhea , nasal itching , sneeze ocular symptom regard experience precede 24 hour . During treatment period additionally report time intake study medication assessment nasal peak inspiratory flow ( NPIF ) . NPIF measure every evening symptom score additionally intake rescue nasal spray . A device similar peak flow meter employ monitor bronchial asthma use . Before treatment period middle end patient undergo polysomnography . Furthermore 2 week start treatment end patient investigator employ 5-step scale ( 1 = good , 2 = good , 3 = moderate , 4 = poor , 5= effective ) ass efficacy study medication .
