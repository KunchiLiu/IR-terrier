	<brief_title>Comparison Between Radiofrequency Versus Ethanol Injection Treatment Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently early hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) complicate liver cirrhosis often treat percutaneous ablation technique ultrasound guidance : performance easy , safe efficient . They less invasive expensive surgical removal , represent potential local cure large number patient could treat liver resection offer liver transplantation . Percutaneous ethanol injection ( PEI ) , first non-surgical technique introduce clinical practice , widely use since late eighty . PEI induce chemical ischemic coagulative necrosis 70-80 % small ( &lt; 3cm ) HCC lesion . Necrosis obtain way generally restrict neoplastic lesion ; chemical ablation may moreover hamper internal scar , limit uniform spreading ethanol possible uncontrolled flow outside lesion , ultimate result reduce necrotic effect persistence residual vital nest neoplasia many 33 % case . Nevertheless , survival PEI seem different surgery retrospective series technique indicated standard percutaneous treatment early HCC 2001 guideline European Association Study Liver ( EASL ) . In 1993 radio-frequency ablation ( RF ) propose new technique ablation small HCCs . RF induce heat-generated coagulative necrosis neoplastic lesion surround liver tissue . However , RF suitable lesion situate close large vessel hollow viscera , first decrease heat generation latter damaged procedure ; cumbersome , need anaesthesiology assistance case , accordingly early report , aggravate high complication rate high cost . A major advantage RF achievement complete ablation neoplastic lesion less session PEI . This advantage impact “ quality life ” patient , prefers cure single session rather multisession approach PEI . When present study begin January 2001 , randomise control trial compare RF PEI publish data available mid-long term local tumor progression comparative survival rate either treatment . Some retrospective study primary effectiveness publish . The aim study compare effectiveness RF versus PEI randomise control trial : primary end point evaluate local control ( sustained complete response ) 1 year treatment every lesion define HCC single patient begin trial ; secondary end point include primary effectiveness ( early complete response ) treatment 1-2 month , overall survival four year , complication rate , cost .</detailed_description>
