	<brief_title>ATERO : A Randomised Study With Tranexamic Acid Epistaxis Rendu Osler Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Argumentation Rendu-Osler syndrome , rare ubiquitary , affect least 8000 person France . This genetic disorder characterise dominant autosomal hereditary transmission telangiectasis arteriovenous fistula . The apparent expression disorder , often cause chronic anaemia , occurrence spontaneous , repeat , frequent sometimes abundant epistaxis extent continuous martial treatment multiple transfusion necessary . The handle major symptom disorder badly cod often demand local ENT treatment medication whose efficacy sufficiently document . Among , anti-fibrinolytic , tranexamic acid , evaluate several time low level proof , regularly prescribe good impression efficacy certain patient . It therefore seem essential prescription base reliable data thereby provide clear information patient regard expected benefit . The recent report high frequency thrombophlebitis RO patient ancient concept coagulation disorder thrombosis ( Bick 1981 ) lead restriction inclusion criterion systematic search possible iatrogenic effect ( inferior limb venous echodoppler ) . Scientific Objectives Primary objective : Demonstrate oral intake tranexamic acid significantly reduce risk epistaxis occurrence , estimate average monthly duration episode epistaxis . Secondary objective : - Document benefit tranexamic acid amount haemoglobine quality life patient . - Identify scalable genetic factor response treatment tranexamic acid . - Describe compliance tolerance treatment . Method Experimental Design We suggest realisation randomise comparative clinical trial versus placebo , crossover random alternate period three month total six month . Study Population 213 affect patient , display sufficiently invalidate epistaxis require basal treatment , recruit follow every 3 month . Recruitment lean team part national French network close collaboration reference centre Rendu-Osler disorder , appoint Lyon 19th November 2004 . Follow study carry Clinical Investigational Centre related town . Outcome measure The main criterion efficacy average duration epistaxis , secondary criterion efficacy average number epistaxis measure per month . Tolerance analyse accord occurrence venal arterial thrombosis allergic accident . Venal thrombosis systematically seek inferior limb echodoppler . Response marker seek modelisation incorporating environmental , phenotypic genetic factor . Expected benefit From individual point view , knowledge response tranexamic acid measure precisely possible , represent benefit study participant , able continue treatment knowingly prove efficient . From general point view , ATERO study aid decision whether continue course action despite lack proof justify efficacy well cost absence adverse effect . The precise documentation innocuousness may necessary mean specific study depend result ATERO study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Repeated , spontaneous epistaxis know Rendu Osler patient want global caring , must daily epistaxis ( &gt; 28 month ) total amount 60 minute bleed month ( 50 % RenduOsler patient bleed 20 99 % 50 penetrance complete ) . Good completion grid control record number duration epistaxis period three month . Rendu Osler syndrome specific phenotype : absence epistaxis occasional epistaxis , need particular care . Maintained expectation ENT treatment epistaxis delay three month . Incapacity detail number epistaxis , especially , least , within three month enter study . No informed consent obtain inform patient participation study . Expected lack observance incapacity compel daily treatment . Formal indication Tranexamic Acid ( angioneurotic oedema disease modify treatment 3 4 g/ day ) . Contraindications Tranexamic acid : history convulsion , arterial veinous thrombosis , , positivity veinous echo doppler inferior limb ; Serum creatinine &gt; 250 Âµmol/l . N.B . Cases bad observance frequent , patient highly concerned treatment reduce discomfort anaemia . They likely ready move centre insure handle . Nevertheless , lack observance detect period 15 day placebo simple blind , randomization .</criteria>
