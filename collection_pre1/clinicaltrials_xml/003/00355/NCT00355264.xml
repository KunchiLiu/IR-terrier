	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Phenoptin Subjects With Hyperphenylalaninemia Due BH4 Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within 4 week complete screen assessment determine eligibility , subject enrol study . The study conduct two part . Part 1 : After screen , subject follow two week without modification baseline medical dietary care . Part 2 : Beginning Week 2 , subject receive non-registered formulation BH4 enrollment suspend treatment within one day start Phenoptin approximately dose non-registered BH4 formulation . Subjects receive BH4 enrollment begin treatment Phenoptin approximately 5 mg/kg/day , give orally , prior meal . At discretion Investigator , Phenoptin dose may adjust Week 6 visit control blood Phe level ( &lt; 360 mmol/L ) , optimize clinical effect . The maximum dose allow approximately 20 mg/kg/day . All subject receive Phenoptin total 8 week . Subjects instruct continue usual diet without modification . Study visit occur every week . Tyrosine , biopterin neopterin analyze follow visit : Week 0 ( enrollment ) , Week 2 ( prior dose Phenoptin ) , Week 8 ( 6 week treatment Phenoptin ) Week 10 ( 8 week treatment Phenoptin ) .During visit , blood Phe level measure ( 2.5-5 hour meal ) , safety evaluation perform . Safety assess monitor adverse event vital sign , perform physical examination , assess sign symptom primary BH4 deficiency ( i.e. , neurological symptom seizure , change muscle tone , weakness , etc . ) clinical laboratory test ( chemistry , hematology urinalysis ) . Extension : Upon completion 8 week treatment ( i.e. , Week 10 visit ) , subject offer option continue treatment Phenoptin extension study . Participation study extension continue one follow occurs : 1. subject withdraws consent discontinues study , 2. subject discontinue study discretion investigator , 3. study drug available appropriate marketing approval , 4. study terminate . During extension period , study drug dispense subject monthly , study visit require every 3 month . The Phenoptin dose may adjust visit study extension discretion Investigator . The maximum dose allow approximately 20 mg/kg/day .</detailed_description>
