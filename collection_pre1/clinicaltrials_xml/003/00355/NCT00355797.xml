	<brief_summary>This randomize , prospective , single-blinded , multi-center study involve approximately 1500 patient 100 center . The purpose study demonstrate effectiveness Closed Loop Stimulation ( CLS ) rate adaption technology standard rate responsive technology ( R ) non-rate responsive mode ( DDD ) activity daily live ( ADL ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Pacemaker With Closed Loop Stimulation Compared Pacemakers With Without Standard Rate Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient enrol CLEAR study implant Cylos pacemaker Closed Loop Stimulation ( CLS ) rate adaption technology . Any legally market pace lead may implant Cylos family pacemaker . Prior enrollment , patient provide write informed consent screen ensure eligible participate study . Patients enrol study must implant within 45 day prior enrollment consider implant . Once enrol implanted Cylos pacemaker , first 500 patient 45 day complete ADL Testing visit . At Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) test visit , first 500 enrolled patient perform 6-minute walk test , orthostatic test , sweep test three pace mode , CLS ( DDD-CLS VVI-CLS ) , standard rate response ( DDDR VVIR ) non-rate responsive mode ( DDD VVI ) . The order pace mode test randomize 1:1:1 ratio . The study primarily analyze number ADL repetition perform 6-minute walk sweep test , pulse pressure orthostatic test , secondarily analyze heart rate three test compare CLS rate responsive non-rate responsive pacing mode . For enrolled patient , study collect additional data 12-month period . Patients randomized pacemaker program one three pace mode , CLS , R , no-rate response 2:1:1 ratio , respectively . The patient follow period 12 month ADL test ( first 500 enrolled patient ) enrollment ( patient 501 1500 ) . The study collect follow secondary measure compare CLS rate responsive non-rate responsive pacing mode : change 6-minute walk test distance , quality life , mode reprogramming , atrial fibrillation ( AF ) burden , cardiac symptom , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) classification .</detailed_description>
