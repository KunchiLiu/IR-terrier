	<brief_summary>The investigator develop new non-invasive medical device call Bioelectric Field Imager . They plan use device measure electric field near small lancet wound 60 volunteer . Their hypothesis electric field early stimulus wound heal magnitude field vary wound heal capability . The investigator compare electric field near arm leg wound male female age group 18-30 65-80 . In addition measure wound field diabetic near chronic ulcer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We first characterize lateral electric field near reproducible skin wound healthy male female subject 18-30 year age . A standard superficial , dermal wind 0.5 mm long inflict use Ascensia Microlet Vaculance Bayer Health Care 21 gauge lancet deep setting . This set penetrate epidermis stop within dermis . We first determine variability within individual measure electric field near two wound close volar forearm . We determine variability different body region compare wound field near lancet wound volar forearm one leg . If hair present remove shave wound site prior wounding . By collect data 10 male 10 female age group determine gender age dependence field strength . Finally determine lateral electric field near lancet wound diabetic near chronic skin wound . If field small field find near acute wound , would provide rationale future study impose electric field enhance wound healing .</detailed_description>
