	<detailed_description>Migraine common child one common etiologies headache lead emergency room presentation child [ 1-3 ] . Despite high prevalence , pediatric study acute treatment migraine headache . Anti-dopaminergic medication metoclopramide often consider first line medication emergency room treatment acute migraine [ personal communication Children 's Hospital Philadelphia Emergency Department physicians ] , two pediatric study guide clinical management . One retrospective , uncontrolled , descriptive study [ 4 ] one prospective , double-blind study compare anti-dopaminergic medication different medication include control group [ 5 ] . More rigorous study need determine whether commonly utilized anti-dopaminergic medication efficacious . We perform prospective , randomize , double-blind placebo control study acute treatment pediatric migrainous headache metoclopramide . Primary Objective The primary objective study determine whether metoclopramide add standard care [ intravenous ( iv ) hydration , darken room ] superior placebo standard care resolve acute migraine headache intensity within two hour child age 8 18 year present emergency department ( ED ) . Secondary Objectives : 1 . Determine whether metoclopramide add standard care ( iv hydration , darken room ) superior placebo standard care resolve acute migraine headache intensity within one hour child age 8 18 year present emergency department . 2 . Determine whether metoclopramide add standard care ( iv hydration , darken room ) superior placebo standard care resolve acute migraine headache intensity 24 hour child age 8 18 year present emergency department . Study Design : The study prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study metoclopramide versus placebo . Subjects may receive two dos study medication one hour apart . Children present emergency department migraine headache base International Classification Headache Disorders ( ICHD ) criterion eligible enrollment . A standard assessment form sue ensure child meet ICHD criterion . Children randomize receive either metoclopramide placebo ( intravenous fluid injection ) . Both patient study investigator perform assessment blind group assignment , Emergency Department physician aware group assignment ( act pharmacist ) problem arise evaluate treated clinically indicate . Assessment headache associate feature occur one hour . If child headache free , receive second dose either metoclopramide placebo . If receive metoclopramide initially second dose metoclopramide , receive placebo initially second dose placebo . Assessment headache associate feature occur two hour . This mark primary endpoint , primary objective determine whether metoclopramide superior placebo make patient headache free two hour . Headache recurrence assess 24 hour . Subject Population : Children recruit Emergency Department . Consent assent obtain describe protocol . Number Subjects : All subject recruit Emergency Department single institution . Sample size calculation suggest need 44 subject analysis . Study Duration The total duration study one day subject . The maximum time spend Emergency Department six hour . We expect subject enrollment take approximately six month . Study Phases : 1 . Screening Phase : Upon presentation Emergency Department , patient diagnose migrainous headache base International Classification Headache Disorders criterion consider enrollment . If meet inclusion exclusion criterion consented/assented enrolled study . 2 . Basic Information Collection Basic demographic information , medical history , psychological/psychiatric history past headache history , information regard current headache gather . 3 . Double-Blind Study Subjects randomize receive metoclopramide placebo double blind study . Baseline headache associate symptom data gather . Assessments perform one hour two hour . The two hour assessment primary endpoint . If headache resolve , cross-over occur . Children receive metoclopramide initially receive placebo injection , need , second injection one hour later . Children receive placebo initially receive metoclopramide , need , second injection one hour later . Headache assessment perform one two hour cross-over . 4 . Follow-up Phase Patients rate headache intensity associate symptom one day order ass recurrence . Efficacy Evaluations : Efficacy judge hourly medication ( placebo administration ) . Efficacy reduce headache intensity judge 0-10 point numerical rating scale . The primary measure efficacy headache freedom ( rating zero ) . Secondary measure improvement headache intensity clinically relevant ( 6 point improvement ) improvement measurable ( 3 point improvement ) , improvement associate symptom ( base 4 point categorical scale ) , improvement disability ( base 4 point categorical scale ) . Safety Evaluations : All subject enter study include safety analysis . The frequency description adverse event summarize . Any serious adverse event describe detail . Statistical And Analytic Plan : Based prior study , estimate metoclopramide efficacy 80 % placebo rate 35 % . Sample size power calculation use alpha value 0.05 power 0.8 demonstrate need enroll 44 patient study . Subjects drop due need faster rescue medication maintain analysis perform intent-to-treat manner .</detailed_description>
