	<brief_title>Effect Site Controlled , Reaction Time Safeguarded , Patient Maintained Sedation With Propofol Anxious Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive conscious sedation dentistry endoscopy usually treat intermittent bolus dos intravenous midazolam ( administer operator-sedationist ) . The safety regime question report 13 % patient desaturating 80 % recovery area follow sedation endoscopy . Mortality occur 0.05 % endoscopy patient ( approximately 60 % due hypoxaemia ) . The aim work , therefore , look provide sedation safer well efficacious . The drug propofol , agent commonly use induce general anaesthesia UK , also frequently administer intravenously anaesthetist low dos provide conscious sedation patient undergo unpleasant procedure i.e . patient become relaxed , anxiety-free , maintain verbal contact throughout . The technique patient maintain sedation use drug propofol ( patient increase amount sedation ( propofol ) receive press demand button attach standard infusion device ) use anaesthetist evaluate since 1997 . Several recent study publish submit publication research group patient maintain sedation use drug propofol show method sedation safe effective dental patient ( 120 patient study ) . It also show method , compare establish method sedation oral surgery ( dentist administer dos midazolam intravenously ) , produce quick recovery less anxiety prior surgery . The routine use propofol traditionally restricted anaesthetist , high dos general anaesthesia produce possible loss airway patency . Currently safety feature predominantly patient become sedated press patient demand button hence increase amount propofol receiving . Also device ensures blood brain concentration equilibrate within 10 % another successful demand propofol make ( usually take approximately two minute ) allow maximum calculated brain concentration 3 micrograms/milliliter propofol . The device also start decrease calculate brain concentration propofol demand button press six minute . Despite encouraging result also find recent pilot study involve 20 healthy volunteer instruct try make unconscious 2 case sedation ( one briefly lose verbal contact require supplemental oxygen ) . Over sedation , however , demonstrate oral surgery patient previous study . This may due high level anxiety dental patient affect response propofol . We therefore incorporate additional safety feature exist previously study patient maintain sedation system may decrease eliminate small risk sedation . All safety feature retain addition patient demand button also use monitor reaction time one minutely interval . It known propofol slow reaction time give individual another recent study 40 patient undergoing general anaesthesia plan surgery use propofol , patient ’ reaction time record awake induction anaesthesia instruct patient press button quickly possible response handset vibrating . The calculated effect site ( brain ) concentration propofol increase incrementally reaction time monitor stage patient could longer press button . The data study ( deteriorate patient reaction time increase brain concentration propofol ) analyse information use provide additional safety feature within system prevent sedation i.e . patient ’ reaction time deterioration certain percentage prevent able self-administer propofol . Furthermore system actually start decrease brain concentration propofol patient ’ reaction time become slow . The patient demand button use monitor reaction time one minutely intervals well administer propofol . We hope eliminate small risk sedation wish conduct pilot study assess safety efficacy reaction time safeguard , patient-maintained sedation system three group twenty patient require sedation plan procedure . We choose two group dental patient , one group oral surgery ( technically difficult dental work e.g . wisdom tooth removal ) one group routine dentistry ( e.g . patient tooth filling refer sedation due high anxiety level ) . Another outcome measure look effect technique patient ’ anxiety level believe technique may beneficial reduce anxiety level . Patient maintain sedation also study 20 colonoscopy patient find efficacious . However also 4 case slight sedation , none require intervention e.g . airway circulatory . We hope incorporate reaction time safeguard eliminate small risk .</detailed_description>
