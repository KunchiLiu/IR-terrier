	<brief_title>Heart Failure Evaluation Acute Referral Team Trial ( HEARTT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Heart failure ( HF ) account morbidity mortality Canada . In contrast coronary heart disease , mortality rate attribute HF decrease minimally , 14 % , last 35 year . This despite plethora new therapeutic modality prove decrease mortality HF . HF also one lead cause hospitalization account second high total number hospital day third high number patient affect . It estimate approximately 20-50 % patient readmitted hospital one year . Patients see emergency department ( ED ) discharge home ED also high risk readmission . A local study group indicate 44 % patient see HF ED disposition strikingly 50 % high readmission rate 30 day compare admitted hospital . This difference could explain `` care gap '' evidence low utilization angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor beta-blockers group . However , lack patient education self-care follow-up post ED discharge could also attribute rate . We propose test intervention employ multidisciplinary team facilitate follow-up , provide HF education , include self-care , improve utilization proven drug-therapy patient discharge HF ED outcomes hospitalization mortality . PURPOSE : To improve quality care patient HF HYPOTHESIS : Multidisciplinary team management patient HF show decrease morbidity mortality HF patient . A multifaceted program include rapid referral , early short-term follow-up , medication initiation titration HF education collaboration dietician , nurse , pharmacist physician improve HF patient care term clinical outcome , quality life evidence-based medication utilization . STUDY DESIGN : The study utilize unblinded randomize control trial ( RCT ) design . Eligible patient include patient discharge ED diagnosis heart failure . All patient refer ED see rapid referral clinic within 1 week . Eligible patient randomize intervention arm usual care . The usual care group consultation letter recommendation send family doctor receive booklet heart failure . The intervention arm follow clinic monthly multidisciplinary team . Medication initiate titrated target dose . Patients receive education regard heart failure , medication , lifestyle , diet self-management . Communication patient 's primary care provider also enhance . SIGNIFICANCE : The literature describe plethora therapeutic modality aim improve care patient HF . However , term multifaceted disease management intervention , majority HF study examine high risk patient admit hospital stable outpatient . This propose study would examine unique population patient discharge emergency department .</detailed_description>
