	<brief_summary>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) acute chronic inflammatory bowel disease , whose cause unknown . However , widely accept bacteria live large bowel essential development disease . Intuitively , therefore , logical approach treatment would use antibiotic . However , antimicrobial chemotherapy unsuccessful manage acute colitis , limited benefit long-term treatment . The failure antibiotic UC arise fact no-one tried identify bacteria involve cause disease , equally importantly , nobody target appropriate antibiotic knock specific bacteria question , systematic way . Despite , increase evidence implicates bacteria live line bowel involve UC . Our aim , therefore identify bacteria colonize mucosal surface lower large intestine determine antibiotic sensitivity investigator believe particularly involved disease , enterococcit , peptostreptococci enterobacteria . Because investigator already study resistance antimicrobial many mucosal isolate , investigator plan ot focus use combination two antibiotic work . A controlled trial test benefit use antibiotic period one month patient follow six month period . The investigator look significant long-term improvement , reduction drug use follow antibiotic therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It widely acknowledge , result experimental study last 30 year , mucosal flora large bowel essential pathogenesis ulcerative colitis . Whilst treatment antibiotic , therefore , might seem logical approach , number clinical trial prove disappointing . This principal bacteria involve inflammatory process identify sensitivity antibacterial determine . Moreover , begin understand physiology biofilm population mucosal surface , one property antibiotic resistance . Our study show distinctive bacterial population mucosa UC patient reduce number protective bifidobacteria increase enterobacteria link disease activity . Antibiotic resistance commonly use gut antibiotic widespread bacteria . Our study , therefore , commence multiple biopsy distal large bowel mucosa take patient active UC detail microbiological characterization flora use viable counting , chemotaxonomy molecular approach . Antibiotic sensitivity likely pathogen determine dissemination antibiotic resistance gene mucosal microbiota follow use real time PCR . Markers mucosal immune response include proinflammatory cytokine human betea defensins also measure . Two week initial biopsy , patient return pur research IBD clinic appropriate combination antibiotic prescribe take one month . A assessment occur end period include mucosal biopsy . endpoint include clinical activity index , bowel habit diary , sigmoidoscopy score , mucosal immune marker routine haematology biochemical index . Because long term effect antibiotic gut mucosa , last many month , study randomise therefore , run period take control period four week antibiotic follow patient . The prime endpoint sigmoidoscopy score subject follow six month study look long term benefit .</detailed_description>
