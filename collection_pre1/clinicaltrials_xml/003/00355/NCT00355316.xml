	<brief_summary>This study design determine whether molecular detection breast cancer cell peripheral blood Stage IV breast cancer patient clinically relevant predictor progression-free overall survival . Stage IV breast cancer patient measurable breast cancer metastasis initiate regimen systemic therapy eligible enrollment . Multi-marker real-time RT-PCR analysis perform peripheral blood specimen 92 breast cancer patient 120 healthy volunteer . Peripheral blood specimen breast cancer patient obtain time study entry ( prior initiation systemic therapy ) serial time point follow-up . Subjects follow longitudinally death , although study power primary objective address 12 month follow-up . Healthy volunteer ask provide blood sample time enrollment follow .</brief_summary>
