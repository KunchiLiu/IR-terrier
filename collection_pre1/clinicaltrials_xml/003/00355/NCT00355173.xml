	<brief_title>Pilot Study Assess Efficacy Safety Lubo Cervical Collar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cervical spine stabilization usually achieve semi-rigid collar . While collar achieve goal support cervical spine , limit possibility jaw thrust airway manipulation . Definitive airway protection usually must achieve orotracheal intubation . Thee Lubo collar device simultaneously maintain cervical spine control keep open airway non-invasive manner simple operate . The objective study test safety collar volunteer . The study compose two stages:1.healthy volunteer undergo intervention except test LCC.2 . second group patient schedule undergo operation general anesthesia endotracheal intubation laryngeal mask airway .</detailed_description>
