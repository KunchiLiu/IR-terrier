	<brief_summary>The purpose research study compare body reacts different strength experimental cell culture-grown whole virus A/H5N1 flu vaccine give without addition aluminum hydroxide adjuvant . Researchers also look much antibody make influenza virus hemagglutinin ( HA ) subject receive H5N1 vaccine . Three hundred healthy adult age 18-40 year participate approximately 9 month , include screen . Participants receive 2 dos vaccine placebo inject 28 day apart . Participants blood sample take 7 time 8 schedule study visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dose-Escalating Trial Using Vero Cell-culture Derived H5N1 +/- Aluminum Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging clinical trial safety , reactogenicity , immunogenicity intramuscular immunization inactivate , Vero cell-culture derive influenza A/H5N1 vaccine give alone aluminum hydroxide healthy young adult . The primary objective determine dose-related safety inactivate , cell-culture grown whole virus influenza A/H5N1 vaccine without aluminum hydroxide adjuvant healthy adult ; determine potential aluminum hydroxide enhance immune response inactivate whole virus H5N1 vaccine healthy adult approximately 1 month follow receipt 2 dos vaccine ; provide information selection best dosage level study . The secondary objective evaluate dose-related immunogenicity percent subject respond approximately 1 7 month first vaccination . The primary endpoint adverse event ( AE ) serious adverse event ( SAE ) information ( solicit clinic via memory aid , concomitant medication , periodic targeted physical assessment , laboratory safety evaluation subset subject ) ; proportion subject dose group achieve serum neutralize antibody titer great equal 40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) ; proportion subject dose group achieve serum hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) antibody titer great equal 40 influenza A/H5N1 virus 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) ; geometric mean titer ( GMT ) frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer group 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ; GMT frequency 4-fold great increase serum HAI antibody titer group 28 day receipt second dose vaccine ( approximately Day 56 ) . The secondary endpoint GMT frequency 4-fold great increase neutralize antibody titer group 1 month 7 month receipt first dose vaccine ; GMT frequency 4-fold great increase serum HAI antibody titer group 1 month 7 month receipt first dose vaccine . Approximately 300 healthy adult , 18-40 year old inclusive , enrol 5 site United States 9 month , include screening period . Two dos vaccine placebo inject deltoid muscle approximately 28 day apart . The study conduct 2 stage . During Stage 1 , 90 subject randomize receive saline placebo 7.5 microgram ( without aluminum hydroxide ) , 15 microgram ( without aluminum hydroxide ) , 45 microgram ( without aluminum hydroxide ) ( 6 group ; N=15 per group ) . Blood safety evaluation obtain subject Stage 1 cohort screening , 1 week vaccination . Subjects Stage 1 receive second vaccination follow review available clinical laboratory safety data Safety Monitoring Committee ( SMC ) . If dose-limiting toxicity safety-related issue note week administration first dose vaccine Stage 1 ( base review clinical laboratory safety data SMC ) , Stage 1 subject receive second vaccination . A complete Stage 1 safety report review SMC prior enrollment 210 additional subject Stage 2 ( N=50 per formulation group total ) . Sera immune assessment antigen-specific immune response collect subject baseline ( Day 0 ) , 1 month vaccine dose , 6 month second vaccine dose . This study link DMID protocol 07-0022 .</detailed_description>
