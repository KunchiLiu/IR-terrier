	<detailed_description>Provide rationale study ( see list reference attach separately ) . Provide rationale study ( see list reference attach separately ) . Adequate postoperative pain control still major problem many surgical patient . Identifying good way control pain surgery remain ongoing goal research anesthesia . Continuous infusion IV lidocaine identify anesthetic literature valuable supplement general anesthesia . Approximately 20 % total abdominal hysterectomy The Ottawa Hospital today do use continuous IV lidocaine infusion addition general anesthesia . Considering low cost , ease administration , low incidence side effect , lidocaine present attractive anesthetic option . However , randomize control trial date assess effect IV lidocaine patient 's pain control . These trial small single center study require independent validation institution surgical population . In previous trial , standard anesthetic technique well controlled trial . If approve study add scant promising literature concern peri-operative lidocaine use analgesia . 1 . Lidocaine infusion supplement general anesthesia improve analgesia . Lidocaine use supplement general anesthesia 50 year ( 1 ) . It MAC spar effect allow reduction anesthetic agent balance anesthetic technique ( 1 ) . Lidocaine infusion improve pain score burn patient provide sufficient analgesia without addition opioid analgesic ( 3 ) . Its use well establish chronic neuropathic ischemic pain ( 6,7 ) . Over last decade , use management acute pain pre-emptive analgesia increase . Studies demonstrate improved pain score movement rest major abdominal surgery radical retropubic prostatectomy publish ( 2,5,8 ) . 2 . IV Lidocaine infusion dose toxicity ( 2,3,4,5,6,7,10 ) . Lidocaine toxicity occur plasma level 5 mcg/mL . Currently report dose vary 'no IV bolus ' 3 mg/kg/hr IV bolus follow 1.5 3 mg/kg/hr infusion rate . These dos generally result plasma level 1.3-3.7 mcg/mL . There increase local anesthetic toxicity plasma level compare placebo . In one study 2.6 mg/kg/hr lidocaine infuse 24 hour end surgery report side effect attribute local anesthetic toxicity ( 4 ) . In another lidocaine dose-response study infusion 500 mg lidocaine one hour 13 patient neuropathic chronic pain ( 6 ) result plasma level 2.43 +/- 1.01 mcg/mL initial onset analgesia . This correspond infusion rate approximately 6-7 mg/kg/hr lidocaine ( bolus ) . The amount lidocaine use onset analgesia 123+/-55 mg ~ 9-20 minute . Complete analgesia report 10 13 patient correspond plasma level 3.79+/- 1.00 mcg/mL total lidocaine dose ~ 375 +/- 23mg 36-54 minute . In 3 patient significant reduction pain complete analgesia . Light-headedness time infusion report 6 13 patient lidocaine level range 0.9 3.08 mcg/mL . At time infusion need adjust subjective complaint toxicity . The dose lidocaine currently use Ottawa Hospital Department Anesthesia supplement general anesthesia bolus 1-1.5 mg/kg follow intraoperative infusion 1.2 3 mg/kg/hr . In study propose bolus 1.5 mg/kg follow 3 mg/kg/hr infusion . 3 . Lidocaine infusion reduces opiod consumption . Lidocaine infusion decrease opioid NSAID use follow major surgery ( 2,5 ) . A protocol case report burn patient demonstrate markedly reduce requirement opioid analgesia ( 3 ) . The reduce use opiods associate low incidence opiod-related side effect decrease use medication treat side effect . 4 . Lidocaine infusion improve bowel function . Lidocaine use speed return bowel function major complication intra-abdominal operation . In radical prostatectomy cholecystectomy patient ' time passage first postoperative bowel movement decrease ( 4,5 ) . 5 . Lidocaine infusion lead quick discharge . Lidocaine use lead faster discharge hospital in-patients undergo radical prostatectomy ( 5 ) . This result likely due combine beneficial effect outline .
