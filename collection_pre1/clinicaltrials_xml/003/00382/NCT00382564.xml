	<brief_summary>This study determine usefulness magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) examine heart blood vessel . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . The subject lie table slide scanner ( metal cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud noise occur scan process . MRI heart blood vessel , call magnetic resonance angiography ( MRA ) , develop diagnostic method permit evaluation artery vein without use x-rays invasive catheterization require conventional angiography . People 18 year age old know suspect atherosclerotic disease may eligible study . Participants blood test MRA scanning . The MRA take 1.5 2 hour . During part scan , contrast agent may inject vein brighten image heart blood vessel . Subjects monitor electrocardiogram ask hold breath 5 20 second intermittently procedure . A CT scan may do confirm MRA finding . CT use x-rays produce picture heart blood vessel . The subject lie bed scan give contrast agent catheter insert vein . Subjects ask hold breath intermittently 5 20 second . A medicine call beta blocker may administer slow heart rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Magnetic Resonance Angiography Diagnose Atherosclerotic Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Magnetic Resonance Angiography ( MRA ) develop technique permit non-invasive evaluation arterial venous structure without need x-ray base catheter angiography . While dramatic progress make last year , still substantial limitation accuracy MRA evaluation coronary artery . The primary aim study evaluate state-of-the-art technique coronary MRA subject know suspected coronary atherosclerosis . The secondary aim protocol generate natural history data future hypothesis-driven clinical trial use MRA technique develop current protocol . The long-term objective pilot study research initiative improve coronary MRA point reliably replace diagnostic x-ray catheter angiography evaluation subject atherosclerotic disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects know suspected atherosclerotic disease base clinical finding document angiography ( conventional , CT MRA ) , Doppler ultrasound . Subjects risk atherosclerosis include : smoking , hyperlipidemia , low level high density lipoprotein ( less 50 mg/dl woman le 40 mg/dl men ) , hypertension , family history ( early onset atherosclerosis less 55 year old male less 65 year old female first degree relative ) , diabetes mellitus metabolic syndrome . 2 . Subject must willing participate protocol . 3 . Subject age great 18 year old . 4 . Subject must clinically stable able come Clinical Center participate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Subjects contraindication MRI scanning . These contraindication include limited following device condition : 1 . Implanted cardiac pacemaker defibrillator 2 . Cochlear Implants 3 . Ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving ) 4 . Embedded shrapnel fragment 5 . Central nervous system aneurysm clip 6 . Implanted neural stimulator 7 . Medical infusion pump 8 . Any implanted device incompatible MRI . 2 . Unsatisfactory performance status judge refer physician subject could tolerate MRI scan . Examples medical condition would accept would include unstable angina dyspnea rest . 3 . Subjects require sedation MRI study . 4 . Subjects condition preclude entry scanner ( e.g . morbid obesity , claustrophobia , etc. ) . 5 . Pregnant lactating woman . 6 . Subjects severe backpain motion disorder unable tolerate supine position within MRI scanner hold still duration examination . 7 . Subjects unable undergo CTA within 1 month MRA part study , unable undergo schedule cardiac catheterization within 1 month MRA . FOR GADOLINIUM BASED MRI STUDIES ONLY : 8 . History severe allergic reaction gadolinium contrast agent despite use premeditation antihistaminic cortisone . 9 . Creatinine value great 3.0 mg/dl FOR CARDIAC CT : 10 . Recent cardiac CT within month . Both coronary CTA calcium score scan require study . If scan perform outside facility meet necessary quality level , aspect cardiac CT scan ( coronary CTA , calcium score scan ) perform NIH . Coronary CTA and/or calcium score CT obtain outside facility must perform within one month subject inclusion acquire use 16 slice scanner high good quality . The unformatted image outside cardiac scan must available primary investigator within one month acquisition eligibility inclusion study . FOR CORONARY CTA : 11 . Contraindication use CT contrast agent : 1 . Creatinine value great 1.4 mg/dl 2 . History multiple myeloma 3 . Use metformincontaining product less 24 hr prior contrast administration 4 . History significant allergic reaction CT contrast agent despite use premeditation antihistaminic cortisone . 12 . Subjects contraindication preclude use beta blocker necessary perform coronary CTA . These include : 1 . Asthma 2 . Active bronchospasm 3 . Moderate severe COPD 4 . Second third degree AV block 5 . Decompensated cardiac failure 6 . Allergy beta blocker 7 . Systolic blood pressure le 100 mm Hg 8 . Pregnancy nursing</criteria>
