	<brief_summary>Urolithiasis disease effect 12 % population incidence grow . In US 1.1 million visit annually Emergency Departments renal colic . The disease extremely painful , often require large amount narcotic analgesia , result lose work day . Moreover , 30 % patient may eventually require lithotripsy surgical removal stone . Currently medical intervention analgesia offer patient . Based encouraging result several small European clinical study , researcher hypothesize administration tamsulosin patient symptomatic urolithiasis enhance stone passage , reduce time recovery need surgical intervention lithotripsy . The researcher conduct study identify recruit patient present urolithiasis emergency department four institution . A total 500 consent subject randomly assign one two group : 1. tamsulosin maximum 28 day ; 2. placebo maximum 28 day . In addition , group receive standard analgesic therapy . The study team , blind treatment status , monitor subject 's clinical progress outcome . The primary objective study : 1. determine tamsulosin effective , 2. evaluate safety therapy . Another objective identify appropriate clinical subgroup ( ) treatment . If therapeutic benefit observe small clinical study replicate , administration medication produce several benefit , include : 1. reduction time pain free recovery hence rapid return employment ; 2. decrease requirement narcotic analgesia ; 3. less need urological out-patient clinic follow-up ; 4. decrease need surgical intervention lithotripsy ; 5. substantial cost saving . If therapy beneficial , represent major advance treatment urolithiasis . This objective major state goal NIDDK Clinical Urology Program , state mission improve treatment urolithiasis . Kidney stone major public health issue , one person eight affect disease . If hypothesis verify , researcher provide first medical therapy ever disease . This therapy , effective , reduce amount time patient work pain disease , may also reduce need expensive time-consuming surgical treatment .</brief_summary>
