	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare effect 8-week aerobic training program upon fat oxidation vivo marker skeletal muscle mitochondrial content oxidative capacity sedentary obese subject without type 2 diabetes . We also investigate mitochondrial content muscle predicts success weight loss . The specific aim : - To compare systemic fat oxidation rate ; - To measure mitochondrial content muscle aerobic training ; - To determine decrease mitochondrial content also associate decreased mitochondrial oxidative capacity ; - To measure non-plasma fatty acid oxidation vivo submaximal exercise condition prior aerobic training ; - To determine whether increase fat oxidation due physical activity predict weight loss success reduce calorie diet add physical activity program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mitochondrial Dysfunction Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Capacity Fat Oxidation During Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During prolonged moderate-intensity exercise , skeletal muscle gradually increase metabolic reliance fat oxidation . In healthy subject , adaptation enhance aerobic training associate increase mitochondrial capacity muscle . Whether subject type-2 diabetes ( T2DM ) respond exercise training similar metabolic mitochondrial adaptation yet demonstrate . Skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity show deficient T2DM , suggest compromise physiologic reserve might implications metabolic plasticity muscle exercise . This study test hypothesis fat oxidation rate exercise poorly responsive training T2DM , correlate degree muscle mitochondrial adaptation . The effect 16-week intervention ( 8 week exercise intervention follow 10-12 week weight loss intervention ) systemic fat oxidation exercise mitochondrial capacity compare 3 sedentary subject group ; 15 lean subject , 15 overweight subject T2DM , 15 overweight subject without diabetes . The first aim compare degree improvement fat oxidation submaximal exercise obtain indirect calorimetry . The second third aim , respectively , compare degree improvement mitochondrial content oxidative capacity muscle biopsy sample . The fourth aim determine whether fat oxidation non-plasma source increase intervention . The final aim examine whether improvement fat oxidation predict degree success subsequent weight loss program . The result study relevant understanding mechanism exercise train confers metabolic improvement T2DM . In addition , study address whether perturbation mitochondrion could explain obese individual T2DM might difficulty fat disposal .</detailed_description>
