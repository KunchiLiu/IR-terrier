	<brief_title>Identifying Relative Change Ventilation Newborns With Placement Car Bed Car Seat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE The safe transportation infant form critical part public health policy many year . Clearly crash tolerance seat , ease installation , position seat relative position airbags focus intensive research . However safety device , limitation . Respiratory instability potential concern due upright position car seat . This particularly true premature newborn result recommendation perform car safety seat test discharge hospital infant . Recently also concern raise term infant . Merchant et al show mean oxygen saturation decline term premature infant reach nadir 95 % 70 minute placement car safety seat 8 % note SaO2 le 90 % 20 minute . Also , early study Bass Mehta , select high risk full term infant find increase risk develop hypoxia . It generally accept potential adverse effect hypoxic event substantially offset crash protection afford device . Unfortunately , portability car seat contemporary busy lifestyle result infant spend extend period time car seat reason transport . Callahan et al find 187 infant 94 % spend great 30 minute seat device include car seat day . The mean time spend seat device 5.7+/- 3.5 hour range 0 16 hour . Prolonged use car seat infants young sit unsupported may also potentially result prolonged period oxygen desaturation . A recent comprehensive review peer review publish evidence note hypoxia frequently associate significant defect cognition . In study change cognitive function see even mild level oxygen desaturation . Such change observe group except premature baby . The young child may relative resistant , physiology adapt relatively hypoxic intrauterine environment . However recent study also suggest premature infant may also problem . Thus cautious approach adopt child fail maintain adequate oxygen saturation place car seat discharge car bed . The cause hypoxia place car safety seat likely attributable relative vulnerability airway premature term infant . The cause airway narrow slouch head forward asleep car seat result closure mouth , press tongue posterior pharyngeal wall flexion airway . The shape newborn head prominent occiput reduce muscle tone encourage head slouch . A recent pilot study suggest placement insert accommodate occiput thus reduce tendency towards flexion improve airway size reduced frequency episode oxygen desaturation . Thus flexion position , unique car seat , may important implication airway newborn . The American Academy Pediatrics ( AAP ) currently recommend infant document oxygen desaturation car seat transport car bed . Car bed overcome position dependent airway instability . However gastro-esophageal reflux may also occur flat position could potentially result significant apnea . The purpose study define term infant increase risk apnea oxygen desaturation position semi-reclined car safety seat compare positioning car bed . METHODS 1 . Overview Phase I Identify normal healthy newborn ( 200 newborn ) Phase II Explain family risk benefit study Obtain inform consent Review see baby conforms inclusion criterion Review see baby meet exclusion criterion Randomization supine ( car bed ) sit position ( car seat ) 1st position Phase III Physiological test include oxygen saturation , heart rate , respiratory plethysmography monitor chest wall movement . Phase IV Data blind independent review Over period one year , propose study 200 patient . Each infant study supine position ( 30 minute ) , car bed ( 60 minute ) car seat ( 60 minute ) . The order position randomly assign . This size adequate identify significant difference . 2 . Inclusion Criteria - Weight great 2.8 kg - Gestation 38-41 week - Normal newborn examination - Healthy mother 3 . Exclusion Criteria - Weight great 4 kg - Any abnormality examination - Any medication mother child ( include insulin ; vitamins folic acid okay ) . - Caesarean section ORGANIZATION 1 . Time Table The study perform mother ' room ( rooming-in ) . We expect recruit least 1-2 infants/day . We expect recruit easily 200 5000 healthy newborn per year deliver Maternity Hospital Ljubljana . Both male female accrue present . The study perform morning order facilitate discharge plan maximize time baby interact family . 2 . Plans subject recruitment consent Newborns recruit Newborn Nursery Unit . A thorough explanation in-patient study provide . An Institutional Review Board consent form review parent . A copy sign , witnessed consent form give parent . 3 . Potential risk participants The potential risk associate proposal minimal , infant non-invasive measurement cardio-respiratory function . 4 . Risk/benefit assessment Information acquire study treatment implication time . However , significant desaturation , attend pediatrician inform . DATA At time inclusion , collect basic perinatal data , include pregnancy complication , descriptor labor delivery , use medication perinatal period ( drug , cigarette , alcohol caffeine ) . We obtain basic information concern infant ( i.e . date birth , sex , race ) well birth weight , length , head circumference Apgar score . 1 . Data Collection : Each infant assign study number data label number . Each infant 4 lead place cardio-respiratory monitoring . Oxygen saturation measure left hand . The study perform follow feed diaper change . The child place designated position determine study randomization . The control position establish place infant face standard hospital crib . The supine position establish place infant face Aprica Car Bed . The seated position establish use standard car seat result 45 degree angle relative horizontal . 2 . Early intervention termination study : The study nurse available time study . Dr. Lilijana Kornhauser-Cerar , Dr. Irena Štucin Gantar Prof. David Neubauer designate substitute available consultation via cellular phone study . If significant desaturation 85 % long 10 second , child shall stimulate . If persistent desaturation , oxygen add . If still persistent desaturation , study terminate . 3 . Procedures : - Quality control procedures data collection data entry data form . Quality control measure essential research effort . The quality control measure shall implement Prof. Janez Stare , PhD , provide detailed unambiguous data collection . - Back-up procedure . Data file backed-up label study . Weekly file label , date , archive . The final data set permanently archive CDs . - Confidentiality . An important component data management protection subject confidentiality . We establish system whereby name would transmit statistic laboratory . We design data form ID number appear identifier . In transmission data include infant 's date birth form verification record correct ID number . DATA ANALYSIS AT IBMI - Staff Institute Biomedical Informatics Faculty Medicine University Ljubljana ( Inštitut za biomedicinsko informatiko MF , IBMI ) wide variety investigator within Ljubljana University Medical Center outside Ljubljana University research community . This group data process resource center multi-center study since 1973 .
