	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Comparing Open Laparoscopic Nissen Fundoplication Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nissen fundoplication commonly perform procedure infant child gastroesophageal reflux variety medical condition include respiratory compromise , severe neurologic impairment , failure thrive swallowing dysfunction . Randomized controlled trial adult show laparoscopic fundoplication safe procedure result low morbidity , short hospital length stay similar 5-year recurrence rate compare open procedure . The aim study compare laparoscopic open Nissen fundoplication child less 2 year age . Children young 2 year age present Nissen fundoplication randomize either laparoscopic open procedure . Patients already undergone anti-reflux surgery whose hospitalization anticipate prolonged unrelated illness exclude . All procedure perform single institution two surgeon perform open laparoscopic procedure . A total 68 patient need ( 34 group ) detect 20 % difference length stay significance level p &lt; 0.05 power 80 % . Patients follow 2 year postoperatively . Variables compare two group include age , gender , presence neurologic impairment , presence specification congenital abnormality , total operative time , total dose narcotic analgesia require , postoperative day patient tolerate full feeding , postoperative total length stay well occurrence postoperative complication ( include wound infection need immediate reoperation ) . The primary outcome analyze length stay amount narcotic analgesia require . Longer-term outcome include persistent GERD , wrap failure need reoperation within 24 month initial procedure also determine .</detailed_description>
