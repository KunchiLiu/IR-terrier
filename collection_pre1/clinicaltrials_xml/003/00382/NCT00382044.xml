	<brief_title>Audit Effect Changing From IV SC Administration ESA 's Haemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents ( ESAs ) widely use chronic kidney disease patient suffer renal associate anemia . Until recently two ESAs currently available Australia : epoetin alfa/Eprex® ( Janssen Cilag ) darbepoetin alfa/Aranesp® ( Amgen ) . Following expiry Eprex® patent earlier year another agent , epoetin beta/NeoRecormon® ( Roche ) also become available . While ESAs provide significant benefit patient , reduce morbidity mortality , come considerable economic cost . Clinical evidence indicate SC route epoetin ( epoetin alfa epoetin beta ) efficient clinically IV , reflect small epoetin dose requirement ( e.g . Kaufman et al 1998 ; NeoRecormon Product Information date 6 December 2005 ) . Whilst dose reduction patient change IV SC epoetin variable , recent meta-analysis show 30 % dose reduction SC route , result significant cost saving ( Besarab et al 2002 ) . Furthermore , NeoRecormon Product Information state 'generally subcutaneous maintenance dose approximately 20 % 35 % low intravenous maintenance dose ' . However , study monitor conversion patient treat SC epoetin alfa IV epoetin alfa show 15 % increase dose requirement Swedish haemodialysis patient ( Torbjörn et al 2005 ) 8.7 % Australian hemodialysis patient ( Pussell Walker 2003 ) . Unlike epoetin , difference efficiency darbepoetin alfa route administration ( Vanrentergham et al 2002 ; Cervelli et al 2005 ) . Prior 2002 , ESAs primarily administer subcutaneous route administration , due low dose requirement thus cost saving epoetin alfa . However , 2002 subcutaneous route epoetin alfa chronic kidney disease contraindicate due increase incidence case anti-Epo antibody medicate pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) associate subcutaneous use product 1998 2002 . Since majority hemodialysis patient Australia treat ESAs intravenous route administration . Recently manufacturer identify probable cause increase immunogenicity epoetin alfa correct ( Boven et al 2005 ) . Consequently , TGA reinstate use subcutaneous epoetin alfa chronic kidney disease patient mid-2005 ( 240th ADEC Meeting Recommendations , June 2005 ) . By convert hemodialysis patient back subcutaneous ESA administration may lead considerable cost-savings : every 100 patient 11,200IU epoetin week ( current Australian average ) would save $ 110 000-330 000 per year base 10-30 % dose reduction . The negative aspect change include pain patient experience injection potential non-compliance erythropoietin self-administered . Therefore , Renal Unit Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital decide convert hemodialysis patient receive IV ESA SC administration belief provide considerable cost saving . Adjustments dose remain individual caring physician , along line usual clinical practice 'real-life ' set . We wish however monitor epoetin dose change achieve Australian setting ensure dose reduction achieve occur expense well anemia management . We plan monitor audit process . Subjects Methods All conventional hemodialysis patient currently dialyse Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital ( SCGH ) Dialysis Programs convert intravenous subcutaneous administration ESA . Those currently IV epoetin alfa convert either SC epoetin alfa SC epoetin beta . Those patient IV darbepoetin alfa convert SC darbepoetin alfa . Conversion SC epoetin formulation base upon 80-100 % dose conversion factor , ensure patient Hb fall 11.0 g/dL allow estimation conversion factor IV SC Australian clinical practice set . There dose reduction SC darbepoetin alfa . The ESA continue administer dialysis nurse initial dosing schedule frequent per week . If patient move dialysis unit remain treated allocated ESA . This study follow standard clinical practice . As , dose change ESA make patient ' usual treating nephrologist accord usual practice pattern . Intravenous iron protocol currently exist dialysis unit continue . Anemia coordinator currently monitor hemoglobin iron study dialysis patient variable require entered database . Routine unit-based quality monitoring continue accord current practice .</detailed_description>
