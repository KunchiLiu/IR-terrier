	<brief_summary>Using new detailed approach diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) recently develop lab , investigator hope learn irregularity brain related autism . The investigator especially interested brain region contribute repetitive behavior child autism . Repetitive behavior include stereotyped motor movement ( hand-flapping ) , self-injurious behavior ( head hit ) , compulsion ( line toy ) , insistence thing stay , difficulty change . These behavior often interfere learn , disrupt daily functioning , lead behavioral problem . Two specific aim accomplish : Aim 1 : To examine integrity white matter pathway high function autistic child . The investigator hypothesize autism associate specific white matter abnormality cerebellum motor circuit . Additionally , investigator expect confirm expand previous report cerebral abnormality use newly develop DTI method . Aim 2 : To determine whether relationship white matter abnormality occurrence restrict repetitive behavior child autism . The investigator hypothesize difference occurrence type restrict repetitive behavior autistic individual correlate specific regional white matter abnormality . Results propose experiment contribute current knowledge brain abnormality autism relationship restrict repetitive behavior , may relevant understand mechanism underlie motor deficit disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Using new detailed approach diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) recently develop lab , investigator aim confirm expand upon previous finding white matter abnormality throughout brain individual autism . The investigator choose focus particularly cerebellar motor pathway consideration prevalence motor deficit autism well brain structural study indicate cerebellar abnormality autistic child . Finally , proposal investigate possible functional association white matter structure expression restrict repetitive behavior autistic child , correlate measure white matter integrity behavioral assessment indicate severity various form restrict repetitive behavior . Two specific aim accomplish . Aim 1 : To examine integrity white matter pathway high function autistic child . The hypothesis autism associate specific white matter abnormality cerebellum motor circuit . Additionally , expect confirm expand previous report cerebral abnormality use newly develop DTI method . Aim 2 : To determine whether relationship white matter abnormality occurrence restrict repetitive behavior child autism . The hypothesis difference occurrence type restrict repetitive behavior autistic individual correlate specific regional white matter abnormality . Results propose experiment contribute current knowledge brain abnormality autism relationship restrict repetitive behavior , may relevant understand mechanism underlie motor deficit disorder .</detailed_description>
