	<brief_summary>This adaptive Phase I study evaluate RO5024048 follow group : - Healthy Volunteers ( Part 1 - Single Ascending Dose Study ) -Enrollment complete - Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) genotype 1 infected patient fail interferon therapy ( Part 2- Multiple Ascending Dose Study ) -Enrollment Completed - HCV genotype 1-infected patient treatment naive , dosed combination PEG-IFN RBV ( Part 3 - Combination Dose Study ) -Currently Enrolling - HCV genotype 2-3 infected patient previously treat interferon respond , dose combination PEG-IFN RBV ( Part 3 - Combination Dose Study ) - Currently enrol The study aim determine RO5024048 safe well-tolerated healthy people people infected hepatitis C virus . The amount RO5024048 blood measure study amount hepatitis C virus blood dose also measure . During Part 3 study , RO5024048 give PEG-IFN RBV , two drug currently use approve treatment HCV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Part 3 : During Part 3 study , HCV gentoype 1-infected patient treatment-naive ( treated HCV ) enrol . Up 75 patient ( 3 group 25 ) dose 28 day RO5024048 , PEG-IFN , RBV . The first dose RO5024048 give Part 3 500 mg BID , second dose 1500 mg BID , third group 1000 mg BID . Standard dose PEG-IFN RBV use Part 3 . Doses PEG-IFN RBV modify necessary . An 4th group 25 HCV genotype 2 3-infected patient previously treat interferon respond also enrolle part 3 . The dose give 4th group 1500 mg BID , combination standard dose PEG-IFN RBV . Following 28 day combination dose RO5024048 , PEG-IFN , RBV , patient dose additional 28 day ( Day 56 study ) PEG-IFN , RBV . After complete 56 day study , patient participate Part 3 optionally enrolled standard care protocol PEG-IFN RBV , conduct Roche . Patients opt enroll standard care protocol give 40 week PEG-IFN RBV . The primary objective Part 3 ass safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics RO5024048 treatment-naive HCV Genotype 1-infected patient , non-responder HCV Genotype 2/3-infected patient , twice daily dose combination wtih PEG-IFN RBV 28 day outpatient basis . The secondary objective Part 3 ( COMBO ) evaluate short-term decrease viral load treatment-naive HCV Genotype 1-infected patient , non-responder HCV Genotype 2/3-infected patient , twice daily dose RO5024048 combination PEG-IFN RBV 28 day . Part 1 ( closed enrollment ) : Single ascend dose study During Part 1 , 5 escalate single oral dos RO5024048 placebo give 40 healthy volunteer , fast ( eaten food least 10 hour ) . The dos give 500 mg , 1500 mg , 4500 mg , 6000 mg , 9000 mg. Another group 6 volunteer give 1500 mg food . The primary objective Part 1 ass safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( amount drug blood ) RO5024048 fast condition . The secondary objective Part 1 explore effect food pharmacokinetics RO5024048 . Part 2 : ( Closed enrollment ) Multiple ascend dose study During Part 2 study , 40 HCV-genotype 1-infected patient give multiple-ascending oral dos RO5024048 placebo 14 day . The dos give 750 mg daily , 1500 mg daily , 750 mg twice daily , 1500 mg twice daily . The primary objective Part 2 ass safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics RO5024048 HCV Genotype 1-infected patient daily twice daily dose 14 day . The secondary objective evaluate decrease viral load HCV Genotype 1-infected patient daily twice daily dose RO5024048 14 day</detailed_description>
