	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , decitabine , work different way stop growth myelodysplastic cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Tretinoin decitabine may help myelodysplastic cell become like normal cell , grow spread slowly . Giving decitabine together tretinoin may effective treatment myelodysplastic syndrome . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose tretinoin give together decitabine treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine hematologic nonhematologic toxicity decitabine combination tretinoin patient myelodysplastic syndrome . ( Phase I ) - Determine maximum tolerate dose tretinoin administer decitabine patient . ( Phase I ) - Determine clinical remission rate ( complete partial remission ) patient treat regimen . ( Phase II ) - Determine rate hematologic improvement patient . ( Phase II ) Secondary - Determine efficacy regimen , term improve bone marrow function , monitor frequency transfusion , bleeding , infection , well change bone marrow morphology cytogenetics patient . - Assess differentiation morphology flow cytometry apoptosis flow cytometry patient treat regimen . - Determine gene expression change patient induced regimen . - Determine efficacy regimen , term induce demethylation specific gene , patient . - Correlate clinical response gene expression , demethylation specific gene , flow cytometric indicator differentiation apoptosis . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study tretinoin follow phase II , open-label study . - Phase I : Patients receive decitabine IV 1 hour daily day 1-5 followed oral tretinoin twice daily day 10-19 . Treatment repeat every 28 day minimum 4 course absence disease progression excessive toxicity . Patients achieve partial complete response complete 6 course treatment may receive 4 additional course total 10 course . Patients stable disease hematologic improvement remove study . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos tretinoin maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity attributable tretinoin dose level course 1 . A total 6 patient treated MTD . - Phase II : Patients receive decitabine phase I tretinoin MTD . Patients undergo blood bone marrow collection periodically study correlative demethylation gene profile study evidence differentiation apoptosis . Samples examine flow cytometry , cytogenetics , histochemistry , array-based whole genome methylation analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
