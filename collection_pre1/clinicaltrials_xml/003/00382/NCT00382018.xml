	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Measuring blood level tumor cell may help learn well chemotherapy work kill metastatic breast cancer cell allow doctor plan good treatment . When blood level tumor cell high receive chemotherapy , yet know whether effective change chemotherapy regimens time wait disease progression . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study treatment decision make base blood level tumor cell woman metastatic breast cancer receive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine whether woman metastatic breast cancer elevate circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) ( ≥ 5 per 7.5 mL whole blood ) 3 week first-line chemotherapy derive increase overall survival change alternative chemotherapy regimen next course rather wait clinical evidence progressive disease change alternative chemotherapy regimen . - Determine whether patient derive increase progression-free survival ( PFS ) change alternative chemotherapy regimen next course rather wait clinical evidence progressive disease change alternative chemotherapy regimen . - Confirm previous finding patient &lt; 5 CTCs per 7.5 mL whole blood initial screening longer median OS PFS patient ≥ 5 CTCs per 7.5 mL whole blood . - Determine prognostic value sequentially collect CTC value patient . - Compare toxicity patient without elevated CTCs 3 week first-line chemotherapy AND two randomized treatment arm . Secondary - Compare prognostic predictive value CTC number v breast cancer tumor marker , include CA 15-3 carcinoembryonic antigen . - Create serum specimen bank future biologic investigation . OUTLINE : This partially blind , partially randomize , multicenter study . Patients assign 1 3 group base circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) 1 course chemotherapy . All patient undergo blood collection first dose first-line chemotherapy* determine baseline CTC count . Patients &lt; 5 CTCs baseline assign group I . Patients ≥ 5 CTCs baseline undergo second blood draw day 22 ( completion 1 course chemotherapy ) . Patients &lt; 5 CTCs complete 1 course chemotherapy assign group 2 . Patients ≥ 5 CTCs completion 1 course chemotherapy assign group 3 . NOTE : *Chemotherapy may initiate wait baseline CTC result . - Group 1 ( low risk early progression ) : Patients continue receive regular treatment without change discretion physician . Patients eligible first-line chemotherapy trial . No blood collect . - Group 2 ( moderate risk early progression ) : Patients continue receive current chemotherapy regimen without change . - Group 3 ( high risk early progression ) : Patients stratify accord HER-2 status ( positive v negative ) disease type ( bone-only v measurable disease ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients continue current chemotherapy regimen without change . - Arm II : Patients switch different chemotherapy regimen . Selection new chemotherapy regimen make patient 's doctor . Patients receive hormonal therapy biologic therapy chemotherapy continue receive hormonal biologic therapy unchanged regardless CTC level . In group 2 3 , blood collect periodically chemotherapy completion chemotherapy . Samples examine CTCs via CellSearch™ blood test . Blood also test CA 15-3 carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) . After completion study therapy , patient follow 5 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 500 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
