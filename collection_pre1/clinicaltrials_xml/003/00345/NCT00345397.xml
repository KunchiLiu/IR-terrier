	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives : This Quality Life ( QoL ) outcomes project study ability Percutaneous Colostomy ( PC ) clinically benefit Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) patient ' bowel management , thereby , live . This project run umbrella Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) . Specific objective include : Safety : Monitor adverse event , especially evidence suggest use Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy ( PEG ) device ( high risk device ) PC might pose unreasonable risk . Efficacy : Prospectively evaluate ability PEG device successfully function PC ; ability PC work clinically indicated application ; ability application yield clinical benefit ; ability clinical benefit impact QoL . Technical Questions : Seek insight use Fluoroscopy Re-Colonoscopy PC placement . 2 . Research Design : In 36-Month unblinded intervention trial , SCI subject serf control . Using commercially available PEG tube , PC place colonoscopically , typically cecum . Technically , PC directly analogous PEG . Pre-and post-PC bowel function QoL define compare . This first rigorous prospective trial endoscopic PC , especially antegrade irrigation SCI adult . This project intend foundational , lay groundwork variety future study . 3 . Methodology : Subjects draw general SCI population Zablocki Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( VAMC ) . These patient already pre-screened prevalence bowel dysfunction , compliance , interest research participation , specific case finding . The investigator mail 7-Day Diary bowel management 111 potential subject investigator identify bowel management significantly impact QoL . Successful completion 7-Day Diary serve secondary compliance screen define baseline bowel function . If subject interested PC , additional evaluation , include psychological testing SCI-Specific , 20-question , QoL instrument undertaken pre-PC . Repeated measure approximately 12 month allow determination physiological efficacy impact QoL . Additional characterization subject may also allow u retrospectively define predictor success relate bowel motility , clinical characteristic , psychosocial factor , etc . Underlying Outcomes study standard Safety Efficacy evaluation PC procedure , . Details technical aspect implantation , risk attenuation strategy , data monitoring / reporting outline cooperation FDA . This IDE cover 25 patient direct supervision Drs . Otterson Berger Zablocki VAMC . 4 . Clinical Relationships : The potential clinical impact PC large . There 45,000 SCI Veterans 200,000 SCI patient across country . If sample representative , 20 % may benefit PC . The secondary impact healthcare cost , caregiver burden , even employability yet determine .</detailed_description>
