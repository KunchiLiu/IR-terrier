	<brief_title>Deep Lamellar Endothelial Keratoplasty : Small Incision Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Split thickness lamellar corneal transplant perform many year replace front part cornea highly successful . What different study surgical procedure involve replacement back layer cornea rather front layer cornea . This replacement do small pocket incision avoid change front surface cornea . By leave front surface cornea without suture incision felt advantage heal recovery time patient . In addition , particular study use pocket incision even short small length one use previous DLEK surgery try make healing time even faster predictable . This procedure successfully perform patient Netherlands five year . The procedure also successfully perform doctor United States . Subjects participate study among first patient undergo procedure The University Texas Southwestern Medical Center Dallas .</detailed_description>
