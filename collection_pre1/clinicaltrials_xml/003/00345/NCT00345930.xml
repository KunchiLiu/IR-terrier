	<brief_title>DILIN 's Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Liver injury due prescription non-prescription medication use medical , scientific public health problem increase frequency importance United States . Indeed , drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ) important reason non-approval , withdrawal , limitation use clinical monitoring Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . However , detection signal liver injury frequently rely upon report case practitioner health authority post-marketing surveillance . Under-reporting case , lack mandatory reporting system , difficulty establish diagnosis make current system sub-optimal . Moreover , grow use complementary alternative medication ( CAM ) , also increase report liver toxicity due various non-prescription herbal , dietary food additive supplement . Because manufacturing , dispense test product regulate , hepatotoxic potential formulation poorly characterize completely unknown . The DILIN Prospective Study multi-centered epidemiological study design gather clinical information biological specimen case suspect liver injury due drug CAM . The goal study develop database recent DILI case , identify clinical , environmental genetic risk factor predict DILI , develop standardized instrument terminology perform careful longitudinal follow-up DILI subject . Biological sample collect used future study mechanisms genetics DILI . Patients refer one DILIN clinical site , opinion gastroenterologist/hepatologist , experience drug-induced liver injury enrol . Detailed clinical data biological specimen collect . Clinical data review DILIN Causality Committee final determination whether subject qualifies bona fide DILI case make consensus opinion . DILI case ( ) follow least 6 month derive longitudinal profile drug-and CAM-induced liver injury . Detailed clinical data include liver elastography ( FibroScans ) biological specimen collect . Patients satisfy definition chronic DILI evaluate additional FibroScans 12 , 24 , 36 48 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
