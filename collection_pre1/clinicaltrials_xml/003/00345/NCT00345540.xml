	<brief_summary>The purpose trial determine tumor response rate NOV-002 plus carboplatin cohort woman platinum resistant cancer ovarian origin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy NOV-002 Combination With Carboplatin Chemotherapy-resistant Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose research study learn add NOV-002 chemotherapy drug carboplatin work treat ovarian cancer . Platinum contain drug carboplatin standard treatment ovarian cancer , effective many woman . However , many woman cancer eventually stop respond chemotherapy ( become resistant ) . The active part NOV-002 substance make body involved many chemical reaction cell . NOV-002 directly kill cancer cell , previous research show may make cancer cell likely kill chemotherapy drug . Specifically , may help platinum chemotherapy kill cancer become resistant platinum chemotherapy . Previous trial also show patient receive NOV-002 addition carboplatin may tolerate chemotherapy well receive chemotherapy alone . NOV-002 use research study various type cancer . It approve use Russia . It approve US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use outside research study . In research study , investigator look see add NOV-002 chemotherapy drug carboplatin work treat ovarian cancer woman whose cancer stop respond carboplatin chemotherapy alone .</detailed_description>
