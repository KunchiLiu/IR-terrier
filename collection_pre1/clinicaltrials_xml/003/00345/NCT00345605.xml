	<brief_summary>Urea cycle disorder inherit illness body produce enough chemical remove ammonia , byproduct protein metabolism , blood stream . Elevated ammonia level lead brain damage death . Argininosuccinic aciduria ( ASA ) type urea cycle disorder characterize specifically high level argininosuccinic acid , chemical involve urea cycle . People ASA risk serious liver damage , may due elevated level argininosuccinic acid . Sodium phenylbutyrate ( Buphenyl-TM ) drug use treat type urea cycle disorder . This study evaluate whether Buphenyl-TM conjunction decrease arginine dose ( addition normal regimen protein ) improve short-term liver function decrease plasma citrulline ASA level people ASA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The cause liver damage people ASA unknown . However , ASA urea cycle disorder characterize liver damage elevate level argininosuccinic acid , researcher believe elevate acid level cause liver damage . Common treatment urea cycle disorder include low-protein diet arginine supplementation , , combine , help decrease ammonia level blood . Buphenyl-TM may aid lower ammonia argininosuccinic acid level . Although Buphenyl-TM FDA-approved use people type urea cycle disorder , little information effectiveness drug child ASA . This study evaluate whether treatment ASA patient Buphenyl-TM conjunction lower dos arginine improve liver function measure short-term assessment synthetic activity use stable isotope tracer assess ureagenesis nitric oxide production . Initially , participant double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover study undergo 3-day washout period Buphenyl-TM give . They randomly assign one two group : either Buphenyl-TM ( 500 mg/kg/day 10 grams/m2 ) arginine ( 100 mg/kg/day 2 grams/m2 ) ) , arginine alone ( 500 mg/kg/day 10 grams/m2 ) . Participants remain initial treatment arm 1 week , conclusion assessment hepatic synthetic function , ureagenesis , nitric oxide production perform . After assessment , participant undergo second 3-day washout crossover treatment arm 1 week . At end 1-week treatment period , second assessment perform . During washout period treatment period , Buphenyl-TM administer , arginine administer standard therapeutic dose 500 mg/kg/day 10 grams/2 .</detailed_description>
