	<detailed_description>Little known factor cause biliary atresia factor influence disease progression . A variety genetic , autoimmune environmental influence hypothesize important . Most study date focus neonate young child BA , yet old survive child BA provide important information genetics , well , natural history . The purpose study collect pertinent clinical information , genetic material body fluid sample enable investigator address follow hypothesis : Hypothesis 1 : A genetic defect likely causative factor BA among child BA multiple congenital anomaly . Hypothesis 2 : Autoimmune factor likely contribute disease progression acquisition identify correlate HLA among child BA healthy control comparison develop early complication include , variceal bleed , ascites , growth failure compare . Hypothesis 3a : Sentinel event variceal bleeding , ascites growth failure earlier predictor death need liver transplantation pediatric end-stage liver disease score ( PELD ) Hypothesis 3b : Health relate quality life impair compare healthy age match child relate severity illness . Hypothesis 3c : Growth failure measure anthropometrics nutritional supplementation predictive onset sentinel event ( ascites , variceal bleed , death , transplant ) follow 24 month . This study perform Biliary Atresia Research Clinical Research Consortium ( BARC ) , NIDDK-funded network .</detailed_description>
