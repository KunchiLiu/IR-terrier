	<brief_summary>To evaluate tear film stability market lubricant therapeutic eye drop versus saline use Evaporometry Interferometry patient diagnosis Keratoconjunctivitis Sicca ( KCS ) . The purpose research evaluate evaporative parameter tear film quality use Systane lubricate eye drop versus saline eye dry eye patient pre-instillation 30 60 minute post instillation drop ( ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Systane Versus Saline Maintaining Tear Film Stability Determined Time Points</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal research evaluate compare effectiveness Systane® versus saline aqueous tear film stability patient diagnosis Dry Eye Syndrome determine possible application product future . Systane® market over-the-counter tear lubricate therapy United States FDA monograph . Twelve ( 12 ) patient enrol two-period crossover , randomize study design . During course study , patient treat test article clinic separate visit . Following informed consent procedure , general ocular evaluation , include corneal conjunctival staining , Schirmer testing , evaporometry , interferometry assessment complete determine baseline tear evaporation rate . This occur test article administer patient . Qualified patient randomize two treatment group . After 1 hour , order eliminate residual sodium fluorescein , patient administer one drop Systane® ( 40 µl ) saline ( 40 µl ) eye per randomization assignment . At 30 60 minute follow instillation drop , evaporometry interferometry measurement repeat . These test ( pre post instillation drop ) perform order establish comparison later analysis . The estimated time complete visit 180 minute per visit . Patients ask return clinic 2 - 14 day evaluation 2nd assign treatment . During interim study period , patient ask continue pre-study routine ; use pre-study ocular lubricant tear product frequency . Any change frequency product use interim period change concomitant medication carefully record . This especially important since many prescription product ( e.g. , Claritan ) significant effect lacrimal gland physiology . An effort make schedule study visit approximately time day order reduce diurnal variability . For similar reason , patient ask use lubricant ocular medication within one hour office visit .</detailed_description>

Patients apparent Aqueous Tear Deficiency ( ATD ) without slit lamp finding Meibomian lipid turbidity difficulty expression Meibomian Gland Secretion ( MGD ) ocular surface vital stain consistent ATD absence concurrent disease include lid ocular surface inflammation beyond 1+ bulbar conjunctival injection enrol . Patients active systemic disease take systemic medication know influence AT production consider trial . In addition , patient use topical medication unable discontinue least 24 hour prior baseline evaluation exclude well .</criteria>
