	<detailed_description>The Acusof Restor IOL recently FDA approve . This research indicator comparison conventional implant lens use catract surgery . The standard care cataract surgery implant IOL allow patient distant vision . As result , patient force wear reading glass magnify glass near work . With Restore IOL implant , patient ability correct distance vision near intermediate visual need . With FDA approval , statistical indication demonstate 80 % patient test clinical trial need use glass cataract surgery . This research confirm quantify data already submit compare control group Restore Group Phase IV project . The control group subject patient already cataract surgery eye approximately 6 month prior enter study . These individual test 6 month evaluation eye , include follow test ( manifest refraction , determine best vision correction possible , near , intermediate distant visual acuity assess respective range distance . contrast sensitivity determine choose circle line oppose one n't ( assess visual acuity ) , stereopsis indicate whether eye function together , pupilometry measure pupil diameter , life style questionaire life style vision evaluation form well . The Restore IOl group subject ' post operative visual acuity data compare control subject ' post operative visual data result distance , near , intermediate range , well test require sixxth month time frame list . The test require approximately 2 hour 6 month visit control Restore group . The Restore group subject 4 visit . The pre operative visit take avout 2 hour include follow test : Manifest refraction , near , inermediate , distance visual acuity testing , life style questionnaire , obtain informed consent . The 1 week 1 month post-operative visit include manifest refraction , near , intermediate , distance visual acuity assessment .</detailed_description>
