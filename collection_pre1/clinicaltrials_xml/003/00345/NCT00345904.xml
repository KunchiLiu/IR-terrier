	<brief_summary>Vaccination currently effective mean control influenza prevent complication mortality person risk . Because variable nature influenza virus , composition influenza vaccine change almost every year , target 3 main circulating strain . Each year influenza vaccine formulation may thus different clinical study mandate ensure immunogenicity safety vaccine formulate three annual circulate strain similar observe previous year . This study design test immunogenicity reactogenicity Fluarix™ vaccine contain influenza strain recommend 2006-2007 season .</brief_summary>
