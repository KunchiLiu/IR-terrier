	<brief_summary>This study examine use alemtuzumab ( Campath ) patient T cell large granular lymphocytic leukemia ( T-LGL ) . Patients T-LGL often reduce white blood cell , red blood cell platelet , increase number abnormal cell call large granular lymphocyte ( LGLs ) . Patients may recurrent infection , anemia , abnormal bleeding . Campath destroy specific part abnormal LGLs , interfere production normal blood cell . This study determine whether Campath increase blood count reduce number abnormal LGLs patient examine side effect drug . Patients 18 85 year age T-LGL leukemia may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : Before start Campath treatment - Medical history physical examination , blood test , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . - Echocardiogram ( heart ultrasound ) 24-hour Holter monitoring ( continuous ECG recording ) . - Bone marrow biopsy : About tablespoon bone marrow withdrawn needle insert hipbone . The procedure do use local anesthetic . - Placement central line , need : An intravenous line ( tube ) place major vein chest . It stay body used entire treatment period . The line use give chemotherapy medication , include antibiotic blood transfusion , collect blood sample . The line usually place local anesthesia radiology department operate room . - Apheresis : A catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein arm . Blood drawn one vein run cell-separating machine , white blood cell collect save . The remain blood transfuse back patient vein arm . During Campath treatment - Campath therapy : After small test dose , patient receive10 daily infusion Campath , last 2 hour . The first infusion give NIH Clinical Center patient monitor closely . - Induction therapy : Aerosolized pentamadine , valacyclovir medicine give protect treat various infection commonly affect patient suppress immune system . - Whole blood platelet transfusion , need , injection growth factor , need . - Blood test check vital sign ( temperature , pulse , blood pressure ) every day treatment . Echocardiogram 24-hour Holter monitor last dose Campath . Follow-up evaluation Campath treatment end - Blood test home NIH ( weekly first 3 month , every week 6 month , annually 5 year - Echocardiogram NIH ( 3 month ) - Bone marrow biopsy NIH ( 6 12 month , clinically indicate ) - One repeat apheresis collection laboratory study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alemtuzumab ( Campath ) Treat T-Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>T Cell Large Granular Lymphocyte ( T-LGL ) lymphoproliferative disorder heterogeneous group uncommon disease may involve polyclonal monoclonal T cell population , bear characteristic surface marker correspond activate cytotoxic ( CD3+ , CD8+ ) lymphocytes . They often associate quite severe neutropenia , anemia , thrombocytopenia , may life-threatening . There evidence abnormal cytotoxic lymphocyte population may cause cytopenia suppress hematopoiesis , although mechanism unclear . Immunosuppressive therapy show improve cytopenias T-LGL leukemia , however long term use commonly use agent often lead significant toxicity old patient affect disease . Alemtuzumab ( Campath [ R ] ) currently approve second line agent patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) use successfully treatment certain autoimmune disorder . In Hematology Branch , Campath currently investigate two bone marrow failure syndrome : aplastic anemia myelodysplasia . Cytopenia ( ) important characteristic patient T-LGL leukemia , often indication immunosuppressive therapy . Our preliminary experience Campath indicate well tolerate , particular among elderly patient . Therefore , propose pilot , Phase II , single agent , study evaluate efficacy safety alemtuzumab ( Campath [ R ] ) , immunosuppressive drug , subject T-LGL leukemia . Commercially available aAlemtuzumab ( Campath [ R ] ) administer label 10 mg per day intravenous infusion 10 day total . Subjects show response initial Campath relapse may receive second cycle drug 3 month time point . The primary end point study response rate three month , define improvement cytopenia ( ) . Secondary endpoint include relapse-free survival , response 6 month , life threaten toxicity , reduction number abnormal T-LGL clone , response second cycle Campath , overall survival .</detailed_description>
