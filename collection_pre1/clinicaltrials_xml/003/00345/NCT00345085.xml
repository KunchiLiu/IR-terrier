	<brief_summary>This project involve evaluation post operative contrast sensitivity wavefront aberration result among patient implanted standard monofocal lens ( Acrysof SN60AT/SN60WF ) new presbyopic correct multifocal lens ( Acrysof ReSTOR ) . Higher Order aberration visual phenomenon glare halo . They prevalent cataract surgery affect night driving .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Higher Order Aberrations Contrast Sensitivity Between Acrysof SN60AT , SN60WF Restore Intraocular Lenses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Project involve evaluation contrast sensitivity high order aberration patient implanted SN60AT , SN60WF ReSTOR intraocular lens . Patients department Ophthalmology ask participate study routine postoperative visit least 3 month cataract surgery . Patients ask sign consent form prior participation . Wavefront analysis involve patient rest chin device similar slit lamp ; focus distant light machine performs measurement mesopic scotopic condition ( light dark ) . Contrast sensitivity measure fade washed image become indistinguishable uniform field ; involve patient identify pattern chart . Wavefront analysis contrast sensitivity noninvasive test employ sedation anesthesia expose patient x-rays microwave . The propose research alter usual standard postoperative care do routine office visit .</detailed_description>
