	<criteria>1 . Has patient give informed consent accord local requirement trialrelated activity ? Trialrelated activity procedure would perform routine management patient . 2 . Is patient cancer patient breakthrough pain ? 3 . Is patient age ≥ 18 year ? 4 . Has patient receive , least past month , either oral morphine , oxycodone , hydromorphone , transdermal fentanyl treatment background pain ? 5 . Is current dose schedule background pain opioid patient equivalent 60500 mg oral morphine/day 25200 µg/hour transdermal fentanyl ? 6 . Is background pain generally stable average control mild level ( define ≤ 4 11point numerical rating scale [ NRS ] ) background pain opioid ? 7 . Is BTP ( ) general severe pain intensity patient judge he/she need additional analgesic ( apart background pain medication ) normally last 15 minute ? 8 . Does patient , general , use stable fixedschedule opioid regimen least three BTP episode per week four BTP episode per day ? 9 . Has patient obtain least partial relief BTP ( ) his/her usual immediaterelease strong opioid , i.e . oral morphine , oxycodone , hydromorphone transmucosal fentanyl ? 10 .
