	<brief_summary>This research study aim show newly develop investigational Doppler instrument reliably measure blood flow dialysis access graft , see decrease flow may sign impend graft failure also see evidence monitoring flow graft live may extend . The new investigational device know FloMon ; ultrasonic device provide blood flow measurement small probe place noninvasive manner graft blood vessel . The instrument develop may help give insight on-coming graft failure may prevent . The FloMon extension previously Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) clear instrument , Echoflow-A , use similar study one . The Echoflow-A similar device respect exception design calculation measurement . The FloMon compare Echoflow-A well ergonomically design read flow reading 2 minute versus twice time necessary take similar measurement use Echoflow-A .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Vascular access failure one large cause morbidity chronic hemodialysis patient : 16-25 % hospital admission among United States end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) patient related vascular access complication , associate cost estimate one billion dollar per year . The frequent cause AV access-graft failure thrombosis occur result stenosis near venous anastomosis . Over 50 % exist vascular access-grafts US 6 mm PTFE tube thrombosis rate much high native Arteriovenous Fistulas ( AVF ) . Several study show early detection repair stenosis prevent access thrombosis , reduce morbidity cost follow thrombosis . The cost duplex ultrasound access monitoring prohibitive . Blood flow , measure indicator-dilution method , seem reliable indicator impend access failure , recent randomize controlled study intend examine equivocal . This study , fund NIH ( 2R44 DK067775 ) , determine new instrument monitor access blood-flow reduce graft failure associate cost . In pilot study use new Doppler ultrasound instrument weekly monitoring , conduct RRI fund NIH , method predict impend graft failure 80 % sensitivity false-alarm rate less .5/year . It measure access blood flow less three minute , use almost consumables . This study design test monitor new instrument improve health reduces cost hemodialysis patient access-grafts .</detailed_description>
