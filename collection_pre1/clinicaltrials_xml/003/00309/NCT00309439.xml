It must stress randomize crossover study currently accept gold standard evidence-based medicine regulatory decision making . Nevertheless raise concern health profile fatty acid grow reputation cardiovascular disease prevention component healthy food walnut , flax , canola soy . The Harvard group identify deleterious effect cardiovascular health trans fatty acid cohort study result major effort remove trans fatty acid food supply . On hand identification benefit vitamin E cohort study confirm subsequent randomized control trial . Although Dr Willett , senior member Harvard group , draw surprisingly little attention negative finding ALA , remain stick point regulator current debate inclusion use ALA food supply . This concern sufficient Natural Health Products Directorate Health Canada ask full proposal u start study ALA prevention atrial fibrillation due apparently negative impact ALA consumption prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
