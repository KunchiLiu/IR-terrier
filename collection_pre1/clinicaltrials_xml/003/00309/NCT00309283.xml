	<detailed_description>Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease ( ADPKD ) common hereditary renal disease , responsible 8 % 10 % case end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) Western country . At comparable level blood pressure control proteinuria , patient ADPKD fast decline glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) renal disease seem benefit extent ACE inhibitor therapy . A reasonable explanation finding ADPKD progression largely dependent development growth cyst secondary disruption normal tissue . Thus , renoprotective intervention ADPKD - addition achieve maximal reduction arterial blood pressure proteinuria limit effect additional potential promoter disease progression dyslipidemia , chronic hyperglycemia smoke - also specifically aim correct dysregulation epithelial cell growth , secretion , matrix interaction characteristic disease . The fluid fill renal cyst human polycystic kidney form mainly secretion process tubular epithelium lining cyst . Secretion re-absorption take place approximately rate , secretion slightly high , amount fluid cysts increase slowly time . The process , via secondary active chloride transport , also involved secretion fluid lumen proximal tubule teleost elasmobranch fish . Of interest , process chloride transport markedly inhibit somatostatin , demonstrate shark rectal gland . Recently , somatostatin analogue become available used negligible side effect long-term treatment tumor ( 8-12 month ) . To evaluate tolerability safety long-acting somatostatin ADPKD patient , prospective cross-over control study recently perform . This pilot study demonstrate safety six month treatment long-acting somatostatin patient ADPKD . Moreover , percent increase total kidney volume significantly low patient somatostatin placebo . Preliminary data late stage ADPKD also suggest loss renal function patient closely correlate increase kidney volume take small cyst ( &lt; 5 mm3 ) , total cyst volume . Overall , finding provide basis design long-term study ADPKD patient aim document efficacy somatostatin treatment prevent increase even reduce total kidney volume renal volume take small cyst , eventually halt kidney disease progression . Aims The general aim study compare effect disease progression three year treatment long-acting somatostatin placebo patient ADPKD normal renal function mild moderate renal insufficiency . Specifically , follow aim pursue : Primary To compare somatostatin placebo ADPKD group change baseline total kidney volume 1 3 year follow-up ( estimated gadolinium contrast enhance T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging , MRI ) . Secondary 1 . As secondary efficacy endpoint , follow parameter ( absolute percent change baseline MRI analysis ) compare two ADPKD group baseline , 1 3 year follow-up : - Renal cyst volume - Total renal parenchymal volume - Residual renal volume - Renal parenchymal volume take small cyst ( &lt; 5 mm3 ) 2 . Additional functional parameter compare two group baseline 1 , 2 , 3 year follow-up follow : - Systolic diastolic blood pressure - GFR ( plasma iohexol clearance ) - GFR ( baseline ) - RPF ( plasma PAH clearance ) - Serum creatinine concentration - Diuresis - 24 h urinary protein excretion rate - 24 h urinary albumin excretion rate - Protein , albumin , creatinine concentration spot morning urine sample - Protein /creatinine ratio spot morning urine sample - Albumin/creatinine ratio spot morning urine sample - Urinary sodium , urea , glucose , phosphorus concentration ( 24 hr sample ) - Urine osmolality ( calculate ) 3 . Correlation analyse MRI functional parameter also perform Patients Patients enrol long-term follow-up study ADPKD normal renal function mild moderate renal insufficiency ( estimate GFR &gt; 40 ml/min/1.73 m2 MDRD equation ) , evidence associate systemic , renal parenchymal urinary tract disease specific contraindication study drug .</detailed_description>
