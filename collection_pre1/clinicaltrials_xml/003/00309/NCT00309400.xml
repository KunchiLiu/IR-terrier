	<brief_title>The Early History Universal Screening Metabolic Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Universal neonatal screening program metabolic disorder constitute triumph medicine public policy US last 50 year . State program identify treat disorder galactosemia save thousand life prevent serious morbidity hypothyroidism , phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , mental retardation . Advances science technology , include Human Genome Project , offer opportunity expand universal newborn screen program include many new condition . Although benefit screen program appear outweigh cost , critic point historical example make u wary expand universal newborn screening . For example , ethicist Norm Fost state early screening program falsely identify hundred child PKU galactosemia , inappropriate treatment child lead death severe neurodevelopmental impairment . As nation weigh risk benefit expand newborn screen variety metabolic genetic condition , critical revisit early year universal screen program . Did extension screen at-risk population newborn lead substantial morbidity mortality ? If , learn past experience inform current plan expand universal newborn screen ? We propose examine early history universal screen PKU galactosemia US . Following standard historical research methodology , begin review historical scholarship PKU galactosemia , include general work mental retardation , genetics , public health screening , metabolic disorder . We also identify obtain scientific publication archival source document early screening treatment disorder . Lastly , conduct oral history interview key participant history early screening treatment PKU galactosemia . Oral history critical component project , provide information available format . Through oral history interview , hope identify critical event , key people , important collateral influence issue . The second phase historical method require scholar identify key theme base historical record , present preliminary finding group scholar variety discipline . This academic exchange lead PI new resource refine key theme . The final phase historical scholarship preparation write conclusion . As result project , historical article write peer-reviewed journal accessible clinician , researcher , policy expert consider best expand universal metabolic screening .</detailed_description>
