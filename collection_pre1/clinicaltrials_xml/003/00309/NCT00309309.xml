	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Decreased insulin sensitivity , impair glucose tolerance dyslipidemia common feature renal transplant patient chronic immunosuppression steroid calcineurine inhibitor . In renal transplant patient chronic allograft dysfunction metabolic abnormality typically cluster well-established renal cardiovascular risk-factors hypertension albuminuria . Altogether factor may sustain accelerate progression chronic allograft dysfunction end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) increase risk premature cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Thiazolidinediones ( glitazones ) new class oral antidiabetic agent may increase insulin sensitivity activation peroxisome prolipherator-activated receptor gamma ( PPARgamma ) . By ameliorate insulin sensitivity , drug may also improve glucose tolerance dyslipidemia . These property lead current utility antidiabetic drug . Moreover , find one drug – rosiglitazone – report decrease arterial blood pressure albuminuria patient type 2 diabetes nephropathy , take suggest glitazones may also specific reno- cardio-protective effect . This effect could specifically apply renal transplant patient chronic allograft dysfunction glitazones , addition ameliorate insulin resistance , glucose tolerance dyslipidemia , might help control arterial hypertension reduce albuminuria . Recent find glitazones ameliorate insulin resistant status induce steroid treatment healthy subject , provide rationale evaluate metabolic renal effect glitazones renal transplant patient chronic steroid therapy . AIM To evaluate short-term risk/benefit profile rosiglitazone treatment renal transplant patient chronic allograft dysfunction . DESIGN After basal evaluation systolic/diastolic blood pressure , body weight , insulin sensitivity ( euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp ) , glucose tolerance ( standard glucose tolerance test ) , lipid profile , renal hemodynamics ( GFR RPF inulin PAH renal clearance , respectively ) , albuminuria ( mean three consecutive overnight urine collection ) , albumin , IgG , Na+ free water fractional clearance routine laboratory analysis , patient satisfy selection criterion enter 4-month therapy rosiglitazone 4 mg/day , up-titrated , well-tolerated , 8 mg/day 4 week later . Baseline evaluation repeat end treatment period 2 month treatment withdrawal . Blood pressure , body weight routine laboratory test - include liver function test - evaluate also 1 2 week rosiglitazone therapy , month 1 every month study end . Albuminuria also evaluate month 2 rosiglitazone therapy . No major change diet immunosuppressive , antihypertensive concomitant treatment introduce throughout whole study period . A low salt ( 2 gram Na+ per day ) control dietary protein intake ( 0.8 g/kg/body weight per day ) recommend patient . Should evidence clinically relevant water retention liver toxicity occur throughout treatment period , rosiglitazone back-titrated initial dose withdrawn deem clinically appropriate .</detailed_description>
