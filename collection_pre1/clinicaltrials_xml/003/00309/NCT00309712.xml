	<brief_title>Diabetes Combined Lipid Therapy Regimen ( DIACOR ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes strong risk factor atherosclerosis often characterize dyslipidemia hypertriglyceridemia , low high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , modestly elevate low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) . Both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) fibrates improve lipoprotein metabolism decrease coronary disease risk . Statins fibrates affect different aspect lipoprotein metabolism improve lipid metabolism complimentarily . Statins low total cholesterol LDL fibrates decrease triglyceride concentration elevateHDL cholesterol . Since individual lipid parameter show independent cardiovascular risk factor , especially important target lipid parameter level outline treatment guideline . The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel ill ( NCEP ill ) guideline set target therapeutic level coronary heart disease ( CHD ) CHD risk equivalent ( include diabetes ) .Many patient , however , able achieve optimal level single lipid-controlling agent . This particularly evident among diabetic , often multiple dyslipidemias less likely achieve effective lipid control . Several small clinical trial demonstrate fibrate statin dual therapy combine specific effect two drug significantlyreducing total LDL cholesterol increase HDL cholesterol , though problem associate . Previous study , conduct mainly gemfibrozil/cerivastatin combination , show increase incidence side effect ( myopathy , hepatotoxicity ) high cost . This problem address small study of74 patient randomize combined alternate-day simvastatin fenofibrate therapy . Surprisingly , study , case myopathy report , even among patient receive combined simvastatin fenofibrate therapy . The Lipids Diabetes Study ( LDSH Study ) examine fenofibrate cerivastatin combination large-scale trial 4,000 patient . This study stop early study treatment include cerivastatin , withdrawn United States market 2001 . Consequently , result ' utility limit United States . Additional study evaluate lipid therapy capable meeting aggressive treatment guideline outline NCEP ill , especially among diabetic patient , require . We propose twelve-month study simvastatin , micronized fenofibrate , combination therapy among patient control Type 2 diabetes mellitus . The primary objective ofthis study ass safety efficacy combine micronized fenofibrate simvastatin therapy versus micronized fenofibrate simvastatin monotherapy . Secondary objective include evaluation combine micronized fenofibrate simvastatin therapy versus micronized fenofibrate simvastatin monotherapy novel lipid parameter serological marker associate significantly increase cardiovascular risk . The benefit study numerous . First , able detennine efficacy treatment arm achieve aggressive lipid level target outline NCEP ill. Second , trial , unlike previous study , assess safety efficacy treatment arm specifically among diabetic patient . Third , length therapy allow adequate , yet efficient , evaluation tertiary endpoint , include novel risk factor previously assess combination therapy .</detailed_description>
