	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Intravitreal Triamcinolone Treat Diffuse Diabetic Macular Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus complication represent nowadays important issue Public Health term . The WHO expectation indicate around 2025 European population diabetes reach 12 % , estimate percent USA around 10 % ( King , 1995 ) . The severe complication proliferant diabetic retinopathy disastrous effect vision seem solve retinal panphotocoagulation . The relevant issue regard diabetes´ ocular complication seem macular edema . We define macular edema retinal thickening 1500 micron central fovea . It find 10 % diabetic , 40 % important visual acuity loss ( Klein , 1984 ) In environment , diabetes retinopathy affect nearly 21 % diabetic , among , 6 % clinically significant macular edema ( Lopez , 2001 ) . Until treatment available prove efficacy diffuse edema grid photocoagulation , stablished standard treatment since publication result “ Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ” ( Olk 1990 ) . A maximum 3 laser treatment 3 4 month interval treatment accept . Nevertheless , result treatment haven´t consider satisfactory main aim preserve visual function , 15 % patient get improvement ( Mc Donald , 1985 ) . Because alternative study , among victrectomy intraocular corticosteroyd injection . Though , vitrectomy seem provide significative improvement patient thicken posterior hyaloid able make traction macular area ( Tachi , 1996 ) doesn´t happen majority diabetic patient . The identification Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) main responsible agent angiogenesis role pathogenia diabetic macular edema open new approach method treatment complication ( Adamis 1994 ) . This factor , also know Vascular Permeability Factor ( VPF ) , interact “ tight junction ” retinal endothelial cell , produce disruption hematoretinal barrier . It known corticosteroid powerful antiangiogenetic agent , also capable reverse effect mention retinal endothelial act phosphorilation expression tight-junctions´ protein . They also inhibit VEGF expression ( Fisher 2001 ) . It seem logical use propose treatment diabetes complication . Though , side effect , either local systemical , intraocular biodisponibility issue obligate use intravitreal administration . In 2001 publish first work intravitreal triamcinolone vitrectomy proliferative diabetes retinopathy patient , attempt reduce inflammatory response sometimes occur patient surgery ( Jonas , 2001 ) . A series 29 eye show good tolerance drug administer way . The next year , presentation ARVO meeting , author present prospective work without control group 16 eye patient inject triamcinolone acetonide grid laser failure , apply accord ETDRS criterion . The result show visual acuity improvemente reduction macular edema evaluate ocular coherence tomography , effect loss 6 month interval ( Martidis , 2002 ) . Since clinical series publish , yet without prospective , randomized control group study do . These series seem show positive effect triamcionlone either 25 mg dosage ( Jonas , 2002 ) 4 mg dosage . It remarkable majority study publish Heidelberg Group , although series author also publish ( Massin , 2004 ) . There also publish side effect ocular hypertension endophthalmitis , seem infectious majority case ( Roth , 2003 ) due high prevalence need study depth . This approach take pharma industry variation ; intraocular control liberation implant fluocionola acetonide dexametasone biodegradable implant develop ( Jaffe 2000 ) . It also investigate potential effect Anecortave acetate , cortisol derivate , also alternative research : VEGF inhibitor adaptamers , andibodies fragment , PKC inhibitor angiopoiteins , currently evaluate Phase III Clinical Trials . Despite lack clinical trial similar one propose , topic provoke lot interest international national ophthalmological community evidence treatment used country . Comparisons : Study Group : TRIGON DEPOT ( Bristol Mayers Squibb Labs ) 4 mg intravitreal injection follow ETDRS grid laser technique . Control Group : ETDRS grid laser technique .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Type II Diabetes . Mildmoderate diabetes retinopathy . Diffuse clinically significant macular edema ( demonstrated angiofluoresceingraphy , associate cystic change ) . Age 50 75 year . Foveal thicken great 300 micron test Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) . Visual acuity well 0,05 . None exclusion criterion . Informed consent sign . Data protection consent sign . Bad metabolic control recruitment stage ( criteria Endocrinology Department Center ) Glicosilated Hemoglobine great 9 % . Uncontrolled hypertension . Greater 150/90 . Systemic treatment oral corticosteroid , diuretic immunosupressors 3 month study . Record ocular hypertension induce corticosteroid . Glaucoma ocular hypertension . Unbalanced heart failure . Any pathology could cause macular edema . Associated ischemic maculopathy . ( Parafoveal avascular area thicken great 1000 micron ) Patients Clinically Significant Macular Edema posterior hyaloid thicken macular traction biomicroscopy OCT . Patients panretinophotocoagulation . Patients probably need panretinophotocoagulation study ( 6 12 month ) . Record ocular herpes infection . Lens opacification may interfere clinical , photographical OCT examination . Toxoplasmosis , active study eye . Vitrectomy either eye . Record Central Serose Coroidopathy . Pseudophakic patient less 6 month since surgery . Patients situation may interfere study completion base Investigator´s opinion .</criteria>
