	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness safety flexible-doses paliperidone ER ( 3 12 mg need ) compare placebo 3 week patient Bipolar I Disorder experience acute manic mixed episode . This study also evaluate effect paliperidone ER global functioning , compare effectiveness flexible dose paliperidone ER quetiapine 12 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Flexible Doses Extended-release ( ER ) Paliperidone Compared With Flexible Doses Quetiapine Placebo Patients With Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several treatment available treatment acute manic mixed episode associate bipolar disorder . Some treatment although use many year , associate well-known problem poor tolerability , significant toxicity , narrow therapeutic range , drug interaction . Often , several drug must use combination achieve best clinical effect . More recently , group compound know atypical antipsychotic , risperidone , license use indication . Paliperidone similar property risperidone expect effective treatment acute manic mixed episode associate bipolar disorder . Paliperidone ER show effective schizophrenia improve drug delivery system reduce potential drug interaction . Study drug tablet design deliver appropriate amount drug ( 3 mg 6 mg ) use `` Push-Pull '' delivery system base patented oral osmotic pump technology ( OROS ) allow drug deliver relatively controlled rate 24 hour . This study test flexibly-dosed paliperidone ER ( 3 12 mg/day compare placebo ( inactive substance ) flexibly-dosed quetiapine ( 400 800 mg/day ) . There 4 part study : screening washout phase last 7 day determine patient eligible study discontinue current medication , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug placebo dosage take ) acute treatment phase last 3 week , 9-week double-blind maintenance phase see effect paliperidone maintain long period , follow-up phase last 1 week final visit early withdrawal study . During acute treatment phase , patient randomly assign receive treatment placebo , 3 12 mg/day paliperidone ER , 400 800 mg/day quetiapine . The dosage paliperidone ER quetiapine may adjust meet patient 's need . Patients receive placebo acute phase ( first 3 week ) receive paliperidone ER ( begin 6 mg/day ) maintenance phase ( last 9 week ) . All patient receive drug , i.e. , either paliperidone ER quetiapine , phase . The dosage acute phase begin 6 mg/day paliperidone ER 100 mg/day quetiapine , may adjust thereafter study investigator meet individual patient need ( force titration quetiapine 400 mg/day ) . Patients hospitalize least first 7 day double-blind treatment , may discharge seventh day follow outpatient base judgment study doctor . End-of-study/early withdrawal procedure do last dose study drug receive blood sample take , patient withdraws early . Patients follow-up visit safety evaluation approximately 1 week later . The study , include screen washout phase , last approximately 98 day 14 week . Effectiveness primarily determine change total Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) score beginning ( baseline ) end acute treatment phase study . The YMRS 11-item establish measure use evaluate manic symptom . A secondary measure effectiveness change Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) scale baseline end acute treatment phase study . Other measure effectiveness include change baseline end maintenance phase total YMRS score , time onset therapeutic effect , responder rate ( define 50 % reduction baseline YMRS score ) change baseline end acute treatment phase assessment scale . Additional assessment scale use evaluate clinical progress patient , psychotic feature bipolar disorder , quality sleep daytime drowsiness , health-related function , rate severity patient 's bipolar disorder . Safety evaluate frequency , severity , time side effect , clinical laboratory test ( include pregnancy test ) , 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , vital sign measurement , physical neurological examination . The study hypotheses primary secondary effectiveness measure 1 ) flexibly dose ( dosages 3 12 mg/day ) paliperidone ER effect placebo change baseline YMRS total score end 3 week treatment , 2 ) flexibly-dosed paliperidone ER effect placebo change baseline GAF score end 3 week treatment , 3 ) , flexibly-dosed paliperidone ER bad quetiapine change YMRS score 12 week . The potential effect variation gene relate paliperidone ER may evaluate separately patient consent DNA ( deoxyribonucleic acid ) testing . All study drug administer twice daily . The dosage acute phase ( first 3 week ) begin 6 mg/day paliperidone ER 400 mg/day quetiapine ( force titration 100 mg/day ) , may adjust thereafter investigator meet individual patient need within range 3-12 mg/day 400-800 mg/day . Patients receive placebo acute phase receive paliperidone ER ( start 6 mg/day ) maintenance phase ( last 9 week ) .</detailed_description>
