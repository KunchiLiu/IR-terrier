	<brief_summary>This study examine brain coordinate movement patient focal hand dystonia . Patients dystonia muscle spasm cause uncontrolled twist repetitive movement abnormal posture . In focal dystonia , one part body , hand , neck face , involve . This study use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS , see ) study brain plan movement . Healthy volunteer patient focal hand dystonia 18 year age old may eligible study . Healthy subject may participate one , two three experiment describe . Patients dystonia may participate experiment one three . Before experiment , subject ask his/her medical neurologic history , complete questionnaire undergo brief physical examination . Experiment 1 - Surface EMG : Small electrodes taped skin arm measure electrical activity muscle . - TMS : A wire coil hold subject 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , subject may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . Experiment 2 ( Two visit . ) - Visit 1 : Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) : This test use magnetic field radio wave obtain image body tissue organ . The patient lie table move scanner ( metal cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The procedure last 90 minute , time patient ask lie still 30 minute time . - Visit 2 : Surface EMG TMS Experiment 3 -Surface EMG TMS - During TMS , subject ask respond shape computer screen push button press foot petal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Currently , cure focal hand dystonia ( FHD ) . FHD research focus predominantly motor execution abnormality primary motor cortex , task-specific nature FHD receive less attention . Task-specificity suggests underlie task-to-motor output relationship intact many activity dysfunctional important minority task . The premotor cortex play key role relationship health , likely , play equally important role disorder movement . The goal research proposal understand underlie physiology contribution premotor cortex FHD . Study population We intend study adult patient FHD healthy volunteer outpatient basis . In task-specific dystonia hand know writer 's cramp , handwrite abnormal due posturing muscle spasm , whereas task do affected hand normal . The disordered relationship task-to-motor output FHD potentially modifiable correct target therapeutic modality identify . Design In series three experiment , propose use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) examine circuitry premotor motor cortex connection FHD , interrupt motor planning FHD , define premotor cortex somatotopy . In Experiment 1 , TMS use test hypothesis deficient inhibition premotor motor cortex patient FHD rest , voluntary movement maintain task-specific position . In Experiment 2 , TMS use identify whether somatotopic organization relevant inhibitory premotor-motor cortex interaction healthy volunteer . In Experiment 3 , address role motor plan dysfunction task-specific nature FHD , use TMS evaluate premotor-motor cortex inhibition reaction time task . Outcome measure The primary outcome measure Experiment 1 change MEP peak-to-peak amplitude patient healthy volunteer rest two motor condition . In Experiment 2 , primary outcome measure location TMS coil optimize inhibition leg premotor cortex motor cortex compare coil location arm premotor cortex motor cortex . Finally , Experiment 3 , primary outcome measure change reaction time baseline test condition transient TMS-induced interruption premotor cortex function .</detailed_description>
