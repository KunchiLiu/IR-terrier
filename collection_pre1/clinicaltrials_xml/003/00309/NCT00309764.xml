This study intend answer three question . First , potentially avoidable acute event ( measure ED visit hospital admission ) decrease CHF management accompany systematic telephone-based monitoring compare usual care ? Second , medication compliance improve CHF management accompany systematic telephone-based monitoring compare usual care ? Third , perceive health status ( physical emotional function ) improve CHF management accompany systematic telephone-based monitoring compare usual care ?</detailed_description>
