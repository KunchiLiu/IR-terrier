	<brief_title>Effects Disease Management Development End Stage Renal Disease Type 2 Diabetic Patients With Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetic patient consume 10 % health care cost develop country . Over 80 % resource use treat diabetic complication late stage disease . Over 30 % patient admit medical ward Hong Kong 's public hospital diabetes , mainly due cardiovascular renal complication . Diabetes lead cause end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , account 30-50 % patient renal replacement therapy ( RRT ) . In Hong Kong , number patient receive RRT increase 50 % last 5 year number patient ESRD due diabetes double . Between 10 % 15 % patient attend medical clinic local public hospital either receive insulin anti-diabetic drug . In community hospital setting , 30 % 50 % diabetic patient albuminuria , far powerful predictor early mortality , cardiovascular morbidity renal disease . Local publish data show 3-10 % diabetic patient die developed clinical endpoint yearly . There overwhelm evidence support beneficial effect optimal control cardiovascular risk factor clinical outcome diabetic patient . However , study examine effective way translate scientific evidence collect closely monitored clinical trial situation daily clinical practice . Results multi-centre , randomize study provide important information health care policy maker regard cost effectiveness disease management use multidisciplinary team deliver structure care model light grow diabetes epidemic constraint finite resource need equity .</detailed_description>
