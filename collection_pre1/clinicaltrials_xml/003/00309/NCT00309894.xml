	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Drugs , ketoconazole , may stop adrenal gland make androgen . GM-CSF may help ketoconazole work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Giving ketoconazole together hydrocortisone GM-CSF may effective treatment prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give ketoconazole together hydrocortisone GM-CSF work treat patient progressive prostate cancer hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketoconazole , Hydrocortisone , GM-CSF Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer After Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate effect ketoconazole , hydrocortisone , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) time clinical progression patient prostate cancer progress primary hormonal therapy . Secondary - Evaluate objective response frequency patient treat regimen . - Investigate safety regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized study . Patients receive oral ketoconazole three time daily oral hydrocortisone twice daily day 1-28 sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) subcutaneously day 15-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 48 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
