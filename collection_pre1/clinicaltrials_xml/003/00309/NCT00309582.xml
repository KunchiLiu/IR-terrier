	<brief_summary>Nevirapine ( NVP ) -based antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) commonly use many develop country due affordability feasibility . Nonetheless , potential drug-drug interaction NVP fluconazole ( FLU ) major concern . NVP induce cytochrome P450 isoenzymes liver FLU inhibit activity enzyme . The recent report demonstrate fluconazole significantly raise plasma NVP level may cause serious hepatotoxicity . Conversely , NVP significantly influence plasma level FLU . However , enough data recommendation adjust NVP dosage concurrent use drug order avoid adverse event . A previous study demonstrate genetic disposition may play role NVP hypersensitivity reaction . There little data safety tolerability concurrent use NVP FLU Asian population . We therefore conduct prospective observational study compare trough plasma NVP level frequency adverse event among antiretroviral HIV-infected patient receive FLU receive FLU different dosage cryptococcosis prophylaxis treatment ; subsequently receive NVP-based ART regimen .</brief_summary>
