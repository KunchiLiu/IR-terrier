	<brief_title>Cediranib Maleate Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conduct multi-center phase II trial cediranib patient unresectable , histologically-confirmed malignant mesothelioma ( MM ) receive &lt; =1 prior regimen chemotherapy . The primary endpoint objective response rate . Initial cediranib dose 45 mg daily 28-day cycle . Due substantial toxicity , start dose subsequently lower 30 mg daily . Pretreatment evaluation include medical history physical exam , complete blood count differential , chemistry panel , pregnancy test , compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest , abdomen , pelvis relevant . A history physical exam repeat every 14 day laboratory evaluation include complete blood count differential , serum chemistry panel , urinalysis repeat every 7 day . Patients provide blood pressure monitoring device diary record blood pressure reading twice daily . Patients receive minimum 2 cycle unless unacceptable toxicity rapid clinical progression disease occur . Response evaluate CT image every two cycle . Confirmatory scan obtain least 4 week initial documentation objective complete partial response . Cediranib administer orally daily day 1 28 28-day cycle . Cediranib initially dose 45 mg daily , due substantial rate toxicity protocol amend June 2007 decrease start dose 30 mg daily . Cediranib take 1 hour ( h ) 2 h meal . Only one dose modification permit . When start cediranib dose 45 mg , dose level-1 30 mg daily . After protocol amendment , dose level-1 20 mg daily . Further dose reduction allow discretion investigator patient receive clinical benefit cediranib &gt; 3 month . Patients undergo blood collection periodically study biomarker optional pharmacogenomic correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 8 week . Adverse effect grade accord National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0 . The dose reduce grade 3 great non-hematologic toxicity attributable cediranib grade 4 hematologic toxicity toxicity last &gt; 5 day resolve &lt; =grade 2 . Maximal antihypertensive therapy define take 4 antihypertensive agent &gt; 2 week full dosage . For patient antihypertensive therapy elevation systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &gt; =140 mmHg diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) &gt; =90 mmHg 2 separate reading 48 h period , dose cediranib maintain without interruption dosage current antihypertensive therapy increase additional antihypertensive agent start . If 2 reading report SBP &gt; =180 mmHg DBP &gt; =105 mmHg 1 week period , cediranib hold either increase dosage current antihypertensive therapy additional antihypertensive agent add . Resumption cediranib allow blood pressure &lt; 140/90 mmHg . If 2 blood pressure reading record SBP &gt; =160 mmHg DBP &gt; =105 mmHg 1 h apart 48 hour period patient already maximal antihypertensive therapy , cediranib hold treatment resume 1 dose level lower blood pressure &lt; 160/105 . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine objective response rate patient malignant pleural , peritoneal , tunica vaginalis mesothelioma amenable curative surgery treat AZD2171 ( cediranib maleate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival patient treat AZD2171 . II . Determine toxicity experience patient treated AZD2171 . III . Determine median overall survival patient treat AZD2171 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Generate preliminary data regard potential utility pharmacogenomic plasma/serum biomarkers angiogenesis predictive prognostic marker future investigation drug malignant mesothelioma .</detailed_description>
