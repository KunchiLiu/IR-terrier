	<brief_title>Low Dose Sirolimus CsA-Based Maintenance Immunosuppression After Induction With Campath-1 Kidney Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The last 40 year period remarkable evolution organ transplantation nothing well-established form treatment good short-term result . These finding achieve mainly use conventional triple-drug regimen cyclosporine ( CsA ) , azathioprine ( mycophenolate mofetil , MMF ) , steroid . During past 15 year , however , superior immunosuppressive efficacy CsA well-known toxicity long-term steroid therapy prompt trial steroid withdrawal renal allograft recipient various interval transplantation , Few transplant center also adopt steroid-free immunosuppressive regimen . Reported benefit eliminate steroid immunosuppressive regimen CsA-treated renal transplant recipient include improvement hypertension , hyperlipidemia , glucose intolerance , child , acceleration growth . Avoiding steroid-related side effect would contribute improve long-term outcome graft . These benefit steroid withdrawal avoidance must balance associate risk precipitate acute allograft rejection . Moreover , current immunosuppressive regimen , 10 year approximately 50 % graft lose due mainly chronic rejection side-effects immunosuppressive therapy . Thus , quest therapy might induce specific immune tolerance – ideally via short-term intervention would target pathogenic immune response leave protective host immune response unimpaired – provide “ holy grail ” transplant immunologist . We number extremely powerful immunosuppressive drug antibody different mechanism action stage set move current continuous high dose immunosuppressive maintenance therapy low dose maintenance immunosuppression . Indeed , true tolerance occur man , examples successful bone marrow transplantation patient liver graft stop immunosuppression year good function . The humanized IgG monoclonal antibody Campath-1H unique target CD52 T , B lymphocytes monocyte use eliminate lymphocyte blood month kidney transplant recipient . Given potent safe effect deplete T B cell , Campath-1H hypothesize provide enough immunosuppression would allow maintenance therapy low-dose CsA , possibly reprogramming immune system encourage tolerance process . This formally test 31 patient undergo first cadaver renal allograft . The result mean two year follow-up encouraging , 29 patient good graft function without receive maintenance steroid . Similar result achieve recently combine Campath-1H full dose sirolimus renal transplant recipient . Twenty-three 24 patient good graft function 1 year post transplant . However , patient lipid-lowering agent counteract hyperlipidemic effect sirolimus . It also consider clinical trial acute rejection episode early post transplant occur 20-25 % patient . Thus , reduce risk hyperlipidemia associate current full-dose sirolimus , minimize risk rejection , combination regimen low dose sirolimus low dose MMF worth investigate . Despite Campath-1H immunosuppressive regimen claim induce condition “ almost tolerance ” , prove evidence development persistent regulatory immune response long-term post transplant provide . Thus , characterize phenotypically functionally distinct subset T-regulatory cell possibly generate selectively non-rejecting transplant recipient Campath-1H-based immunosuppressive regimen may help find new noninvasive marker immune system activation tailor immunosuppressive protocol . Aims study This prospective study adult kidney transplant recipient design follow aim : Primary To compare effect Campath-1H , low dose sirolimus versus Campath-1H , low dose CsA , addition low dose MMF phenotypic functional profile peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) kidney transplant recipient steroid-free regimen . Secondary To compare two group kidney transplant recipient 6 12 month post-Tx : - Incidence acute allograft rejection - Time course graft function ( serum creatinine concentration ) - Time course glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) - Systolic diastolic blood pressure - Need antihypertensive therapy - Lipid profile ( cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL ) - Need statins - Fasting blood glucose need antidiabetic agent - 24 h urinary protein excretion rate - Patient graft survival - Incidence major adverse event ( post-transplant anuria , major infection , cancer , abnormal liver function test , abnormal hematological blood cell count ) As extension project , patient still study month 12 post-transplant , biopsy evidence acute chronic rejection , persistent donor specific unresponsiveness intact 3rd party response MLR , presence immune regulatory cell peripheral blood undergo program sequential withdrawal maintenance low dose immunosuppressive drug . Randomization Group 1 ( n=11 ) : Campath-1H , low dose sirolimus , low dose MMF These patient receive Campath-1H day 0 transplant . Low dose sirolimus ( target trough concentration 5-10 ng/ml ) low dose MMF ( 750 mg twice day ) give orally start day transplant ( first day nasogastric tube ) . Methylprednisolone ( 500 mg ) administer intravenously day 0 , 1 , 2 posttransplant . The first treatment perform 30 min dose Campath-1H , minimize reaction cytokine release . Group 2 ( n=10 ) : Campath-1H , low dose CsA , low dose MMF The patient receive Campath-1H day 0 transplant . Low dose CsA ( target blood C2 level : 450-750 ng/ml ) low dose MMF ( 750 mg twice day ) give orally start day transplant ( first day nasogastric tube ) . Methylprednisolone administer intravenously day 0 ( 500 mg ) , 1 ( 250 mg ) , 2 ( 125 mg ) post-transplant . The first treatment perform 30 min dose Campath-1H , minimize reaction cytokine release . Randomization perform Clinical Research Center Rare Disease Aldo eCele Daccò Mario Negri Institute Pharmacological Research . Study design All patient enter study manage accord standard protocol already use participate Centers.A tissue sample take kidney harvest donor , percutaneous renal biopsy , end 12 month follow-up morphological evaluation . Beside conventional histological examination . immunostaining cytokine , possible mediator chronic renal injury ( ET-1 , TGF-β , RANTES ) perform . Clinical parameter monitor least every month . Functional parameter evaluate month 6 12 post-transplant . Moreover , blood CsA C2 , blood sirolimus trough level , plasma MMF trough level monitor . All patient undergo immunophenotyping circulate peripheral blood leukocyte different time point post-transplant . All patient also undergo lymphocyte function assay different time point posttransplant . These assay perform pre-transplant , day 15 30 post-transplant ( time acute rejection recovery graft function ) , month 6 , 12 post-transplant time biopsy due chronic deterioration graft function time graft loss . At time point cytokine detection antigen-activated T cell measure ELISPOT assay .</detailed_description>
