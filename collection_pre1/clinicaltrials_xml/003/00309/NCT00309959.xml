	<brief_title>ABI-007 Treating Patients With Persistent Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate antitumor activity ABI-007 patient persistent recurrent squamous nonsquamous cell carcinoma cervix fail higher-priority treatment protocol . II . Determine nature degree toxicity ABI-007 cohort patient . III . To determine expression SPARC ( secrete protein , acidic rich cysteine ) protein tumor tissue plasma ( exploratory study ) patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive ABI-007 IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline periodically study SPARC protein expression analysis ELISA . Archived tumor tissue sample also analyze . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
