	<brief_summary>Urinary tract infection ( UTI ) common infection patient spinal cord injury ( SCI ) link major undesired result complication include death . The bladder SCI patient , especially indwell catheter , usually colonize bacteria , others cause symptoms UTI . Bacteria cause symptom often call benign colonizer often leave untreated may provide protection infection harmful bacteria . This idea use benign bacteria prevent infection symptom call bacterial interference . A prototype strain , Escherichia coli 83972 , show begin continue extend period time non symptom cause colonization human bladder hold back symptom causing infection neurogenic bladder . Data pilot study two medical center indicate bacterial interference might useful therapy reduce rate frequency UTI SCI patient . Because almost SCI patient UTI time , also large cost treat infection , study impact bladder colonization E. coli 83972 rate symptom cause UTI amaze potential improving quality life SCI patient decrease cost health care . Like preventive plan vaccination , instance , important explore effectiveness new preventive approach . The project prospective , randomize , double blind , multi-center study deal specific piece bacterial interference SCI patient . HYPOTHESES : Placing non symptom cause bacteria ( E. coli 83972 ) SCI patient ' bladder reduces rate symptom cause UTI . A . SPECIFIC AIM : Determine bladder colonization E. coli 83972 similar bacteria affect rate symptom cause urinary tract infection large group SCI Spina Bifida patient conduct prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , multi-center clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevention Urinary Tract Infection ( UTI ) Persons With Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial take place total 7 medical center care Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) Spina Bifida patient . A total 160 patient allow take part study . The study coordinator interview patient telephone person express interest take part study . After informed consent HIPAA document review patient question answer , ask sign two form . Then code number assign patient use along initial identify remainder study . All study participant complete history physical examination include ASIA classification , serum creatinine urine culture immediately upon entry study . One follow 3 diagnostic test must complete within 3 month study : KUB , IVP , non-contrast abdominal CT scan . A void cystourethrogram fluoroscopy ( VCUG ) alone part video urodynamics evaluation must complete within 1 year study . Randomization sample size : Enrolled subject randomize 3:1 ratio receive bladder inoculation either E. coli 83972 ( experimental group ) placebo ( control group ) . This randomization ratio select around 1/3 colonized subject expect remain colonized 12 month . Bladder inoculation : At study entry , urine culture sensitivity test complete use fresh mid stream ( urine flowing ) urine sample remove via catheter bladder . Subjects stop action prevent slow urinary tract infection ( UTI ) least two week upon entry study . Each subject treat correct antibiotic 7 - 10 day exist urinary catheter change three day start antibiotic treatment . Forty-eight 72 hour ( 80 90 hour fluoroquinolone antibiotic ) completion antibiotic , urine re-cultured low urinary tract inoculate E. coli 83972 placebo . Most subject , even external condom catheter , worn Foley catheter time , would expect know catheter size best fit . Subjects inoculate three consecutive day . Inoculation consist put bladder via sterile catheter 10 ml normal saline alone contain E. coli 83972 . Subjects incontinent low bladder volume monitor Foley catheter balloon block bladder neck diversion stoma 30 minute inoculation . After 30 min. , clamp release bladder allow drain additional 30 min . The bladder inoculation repeat second time unless unexpected adverse event ( complication ) encounter . After catheter un-clamped second time , subject observe 30 min . discharge . If 48-hour culture sample take prior inoculation positive bacteria , E. coli 83972 colonization present sample , another antibiotic treatment/inoculation cycle attempt . The timing second attempt decide CORE director local principal investigator . At correct time , another 7-10 day course antibiotic therapy repeat . Three day start antibiotic , exist urinary catheter change . Forty-eight 72 hour ( 80 90 hour fluoroquinolone antibiotic ) completion course antibiotic , urine re-cultured bladder re-inoculated . If 48 hour culture take prior inoculation positive bacteria E. coli 83972 , E. coli 83972 colonization present result second inoculation cycle , third cycle antibiotic treatment/inoculation attempt . The timing 3rd attempt decide CORE director local principal investigator . No colonization attempt make study participant colonize three set attempt . We continue monitor subject group remain month study , analysis purpose , treat `` never colonize '' . All inoculated subject remain without symptom return study center urine sample collect brief medical interview one week inoculation monthly remain 12 month . The CORE director allow subject life far center mail monthly urine sample directly CORE . All needed supply : urine specimen container , proper ship container , label , pre-paid postage , etc.â€¦ provide cost subject . The subject 's study site contact conduct brief medical interview . At end 12 month , subject receive antibiotic clear E. coli 83972 bladder study finish . If subject experience adverse event ( something unexpected ) study , follow research staff event go back normal resolve . Growth E. coli 83972 urine indicate bladder colonization . Subjects consider colonize long E. coli 83972 present even bacteria urine . Subjects develop symptom UTI treat proper antibiotic guide susceptibility pattern bacteria ( ) grow urine culture . Urine culture collect prior start treatment test E. coli 83972 . It important note although method bladder inoculation carry risk cause symptom UTI , risk rather small share subject . There exist risk clamp bladder 30 minute may result autonomic dysreflexia patient , especially dump urine . All subject ask history autonomic dysreflexia unexpected response bladder fill prior inoculation . Before begin inoculation , urodynamics data review . All subject lesion level T7 blood pressure ( BP ) monitor every 3 - 5 minute catheter clamp . If subject report symptom associate autonomic dysreflexia ; e.g. , headache , sweat , flush forth , BP monitor record systolic diastolic BP 20 mm Hg baseline case , systolic BP exceed 150 diastolic BP exceed 100 mm Hg , catheter un-clamped . Monitoring continue subject without symptom baseline BP 's . Interventions , include elevate head bed , lower leg , well pharmacologic measure ( nitropaste , nifedipine , etc . ) use need . The use pharmacologic measure measure follow Clinical Procedures Guidelines acute management autonomic dysreflexia publish Paralyzed Veterans America .</detailed_description>
