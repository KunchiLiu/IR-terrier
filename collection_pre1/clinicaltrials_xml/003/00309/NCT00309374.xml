	<detailed_description>The beneficial effect lipid lower cardiovascular disease well establish . Statin potently reduce elevate cholesterol level also exert pleiotropic effect improvement inflammation-induced vascular dysfunction , upregulation endothelial nitric oxide synthase , yield antiinflammatory antioxidant property low tissue factor ( TF ) expression peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PB-MNC ) vivo . The mechanism action effect remain unclear , already see short term treatment independent cholesterol reduction . Following endotoxin administration healthy human , systemic response include activation inflammation cytokine , mainly IL-1 , IL-6 , THF-α INF-γ , activation clot system enhance thrombin generation , vascular dysfunction , demonstrable impaired response vasoconstrictor . Low dose endotoxemia therefore serf adequate model acute inflammation interaction three system . The goal study determine effect HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pretreatment inflammation coagulation activation human endotoxemia investigate anti-inflammatory effect similar two different statin . Further , plan study genome-wide effect leukocyte transcriptome induce ( ) statin pretreatment , ( ii ) low-dose endotoxemia , ( iii ) anti-inflammatory effect statin . The study carry randomized placebo control double-blind threeway crossover three period study . Subjects receive three treatment period ( Day 1 - Day 5 ) randomize order consist 5 day oral Simvastatin ( 80 mg/day ) , 5 day oral Rosuvastatin ( 40 mg/day ) 5 day adequate placebo . On Day 5 study period , subject receive LPS ( 2 ng/kg i.v. ) . Inflammatory protein expression coagulation activation assess Day 1 Day 5 period . Washout-time treatment period ≥6 week .</detailed_description>
