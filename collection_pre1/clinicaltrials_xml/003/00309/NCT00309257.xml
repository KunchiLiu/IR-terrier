	<detailed_description>Alport syndrome ( AS ) represent form progressive hereditary nephritis genetic defect resides synthesis one several subunit type IV collagen , predominant constituent basement membrane glomerulus , eye , cochlea . From genetical point view , disease quite heterogeneous , since X-linked , autosomal recessive autosomal dominant variant syndrome . In case ( 80 % ) model inheritance X-linked affected patient male . Here mutation stay X-chromosome gene codify alpha-5 ( IV ) . In 15 % patient inheritance autosomal recessive , severe disease male female . The involved gene locate chromosome 2 codify respectively alpha-3 ( IV ) alpha-4 ( IV ) chain . In 5 % model inheritance autosomal dominant deterioration renal function usually occur slowly . Clinical manifestation include microscopic hematuria first find , also become gross hematuria ( episodes upper respiratory infection ) manifest intermittent ( heterozygous female ) . Another sign proteinuria various degree . It may insignificant , describe heterozygous female , progressive proteinuria ( recessive X-linked disease ) . It evident clinical study Alport patient persistent massive proteinuria , induce progressive interstitial fibrosis , indicate poor prognosis . The presence glomerular podocytes describe urinary sediment patient renal disease , include AS recent data suggest podocyturia could act marker estimate severity active glomerular injury predictor disease progression . Renal impairment occur time severe renal failure hypertension uremia represent end stage disease , even high variability rate progression describe . The prognosis variable . Males usually affect progressive form disease . Affected female X-linked syndrome usually good prognosis mild renal impairment . Some female evolve progressive nephritis . The disease also associate sensorineural deafness occur approximately half patient affect usually correlate renal impairment . Many study show angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor slow glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) decline limit progression end stage renal disease ( ERDS ) dialysis several chronic nephropathy . ACE inhibitor delay renal fibrosis hemodynamic mechanism ( reduction intraglomerular hypertension , glomerular hyperfiltration associate proteinuria ) non-hemodynamic mechanism ( decrease angiotensin II , potent inducer TGF-β release fibrogenic cytokine ) . ACE inhibitor give COL4A3 knockout mouse ( model autosomal-recessive AS ) pre-symptomatic disease , markedly delay onset proteinuria , progressive renal damage uremia . Conversely treatment improve renal outcome mouse model fibrosis impairment renal function already present . These result agreement finding ACE inhibitor beneficial effect proteinuria , renal function deterioration survival Samoyed dog , model X-linked hereditary nephropathy closely mimic human AS . Moreover recent clinical data suggest even young patient affect AS decrease proteinuria stabilization renal function result use ACE inhibition . The combination ACE-I ATAII antagonist may reduce proteinuria effectively two drug alone . Moreover addition statin may synergize antiproteinuric effect ACE-I ATAII antagonists experimental model chronic renal disease . Statins give without inhibitor renin-angiotensin-system additive effect reduce proteinuria also human . The purpose study evaluate effect multimodel treatment include integrate use ACE inhibitor ( ACE-I ) , Angiotensin II antagonist ( ATA ) , non dihydropyridinic calcium channel blocker ( CCBS ) statins AS renal involvement . Aims study Primary To evaluate effect standardize multimodal nephroprotection intervention ( Remission Clinic ) overnight urine albumin excretion rate ( UAE ) Alport patient renal involvement Secondary 1 . To evaluate effect treatment : - regression macro micro normoalbuminuria - regression micro normoalbuminuria - regression high-normal albuminuria low-normal albuminuria - urinary albumin/creatinine ratio - systolic/diastolic blood pressure - urinary podocyte excretion - albumin-IgG-IgM fractional clearance 2 . To assess treatment tolerability</detailed_description>
