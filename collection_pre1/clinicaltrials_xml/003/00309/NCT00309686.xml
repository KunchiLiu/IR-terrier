	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness safety 6-week period paliperidone ER compare placebo treat subject Bipolar I Disorder experience manic mixed episode take lithium valproate . This study also evaluate effect paliperidone ER compare placebo overall functioning , quickly response see , improvement severity illness , health-related functional status , depressive symptom , psychotic symptom .

	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Adjustable Doses Extended-release ( ER ) Paliperidone Compared With Placebo , Combination With Lithium Valproate , Treat Manic Mixed Episodes Patients With Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several treatment available treatment acute manic mixed episode associate bipolar disorder . Some treatment , include lithium , divalproex sodium , carbamazepine , use many year . More recently , risperidone number atypical antipsychotic ( olanzapine , quetiapine , ziprasidone , aripiprazole ) approve use treatment acute mania . Paliperidone similar property risperidone thus expect least similar efficacy risperidone treatment acute manic mixed episode associate bipolar disorder . Paliperidone ER show effective treating schizophrenia , improve delivery system ( delivery relatively control rate 24 hour ) reduce potential drug-drug interaction . Treatment bipolar mania often involve single medication . Studies mood stabilizer combination antipsychotic agent suggest great efficacy rapid onset action combination agent alone . It therefore interest evaluate effectiveness paliperidone ER combination mood stabilizer treatment acute manic mixed episode associate bipolar disorder . This randomized ( patient randomly assign receive paliperidone ER placebo ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug placebo dosage take ) , placebo-controlled , parallel-group , multicenter study evaluate paliperidone ER compare placebo 6-week period patient Bipolar I Disorder experience acute manic mixed episode take lithium valproate . A flexible dosing regimen use study afford investigator ability adjust dosage subject achieve rapid control acute manic symptom . After screening/washout phase 7 day determine patient eligible discontinue medication exclude per protocol criterion ( include mood-stabilizing medication lithium valproate ) , patient randomly assign either paliperidone ER placebo 6-week , double-blind treatment phase . Patients hospitalize least first 7 day , discharge follow outpatient consider significant risk violent suicidal behavior . An end-of-study visit conduct end double-blind treatment phase early withdrawal , whichever come first . A follow-up ( post-treatment ) visit safety evaluation schedule approximately 1 week end-of-study/early withdrawal visit . The study , include screening/washout phase , last 56 day ( 8 week ) . Effectiveness primarily determine change baseline Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) score end 6-week double-blind treatment phase early withdrawal . The YMRS establish 11-item scale use evaluate manic symptom . A secondary measure effectiveness change baseline Global Assessment Functioning ( GAF ) score end 6 week treatment . Additional measure effectiveness measure severity bipolar illness , psychotic symptom , quality sleep , health-related functional status . Safety measure monitoring frequency , severity , time side effect ; monitor need additional medication ; clinical laboratory test ( include pregnancy test ) , 12-lead electrocardiogram ; measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , temperature ) ; physical examination ( include height , weight , waist circumference ) . Three scale use ass specific neurologic side effect ; Scale Suicidal Ideation use evaluate suicidal tendency . The primary study hypothesis , treatment patient experience acute manic mixed episode take lithium valproate treatment Bipolar I Disorder , paliperidone ER superior placebo change baseline YMRS total score end 6 week double-blind treatment . The secondary hypothesis , patient , paliperidone ER superior placebo change baseline GAF score end 6 week double-blind treatment . Flexibly dosed oral paliperidone ER ( 3 12 mg/day ) match placebo daily . All study drug administer 10:00 a.m . Initial dosage 6 mg/day ; adjustment dosage base assessment patient 's response tolerance study drug . Dosage may increase 3-mg/day increment decrease deemed necessary ; dosage increase every 2 day unless patient require high dosage control manic symptom .</detailed_description>
