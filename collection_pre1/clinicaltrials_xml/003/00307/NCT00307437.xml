	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy Ustekinumab ( CNTO 1275 ) Patients With Moderate Severe Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although numerous therapeutic option exist treatment psoriasis , still significant unmet medical need due limit effectiveness and/or significant side effect profile current treatment option . Preclinical study early phase clinical study suggest interleukins-12 -23 , two molecule part communication network immune system , may play important role psoriasis . Ustekinumab ( CNTO 1275 ) monoclonal antibody direct interleukin -12 -23 . This randomize ( study drug assign chance like flip coin ) , double blind ( neither physician patient know name assign drug ) , parallel-group , multicenter study determine effectiveness safety two different dos ustekinumab ( CNTO 1275 ) administer subcutaneously ( skin ) compare placebo patient moderate severe plaque-type psoriasis ( common type psoriasis ) . The hypothesis ustekinumab ( CNTO 1275 ) effective treatment psoriasis placebo , improvement psoriasis result improve quality life treat patient ustekinumab ( CNTO 1275 ) generally well tolerate . Patients receive ustekinumab ( CNTO 1275 ) , 45 90 mg , placebo administer subcutaneously week 0 4 week every 12 week thereafter week 52 . For patient partially respond start regimen , dose interval may adjust every 8 week . Patients enter long term extension portion study week 52 patient continue receive treatment ustekinumab ( CNTO 1275 ) follow total 264 week initial ( week 0 ) administration study agent . The dose ustekinumab ( CNTO 1275 ) 45 90 mg placebo administer subcutaneously week 0 4 week every 12 week thereafter .
