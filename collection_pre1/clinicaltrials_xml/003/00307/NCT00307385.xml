	<brief_summary>This study examine whether hand movement stroke patient improve applying electrical stimulation side brain affect stroke . It compare effect similar brain stimulation stroke patient healthy volunteer . Healthy , right-handed normal volunteer stroke patient 18 80 year age may eligible study . Patients ' stroke must occur least 3 month enter study affect one side brain . Candidates screen medical history , brain MRI , evaluation memory attention span . Pregnant woman exclude study . The study involve seven 2-day session course 8 week , session separate least 1 week . During session participant practice pattern hand movement accuracy perform movement evaluate brain electrical stimulation . The movement include complex finger sequence , simple finger sequence , peg test ( place wooden peg hole board ) , hand function test ( turn card , pick small object one hand placing , pick small object spoon placing , stack checker , move light can , move heavy can ) , box block test ( pick move block one box another ) . The first day 2-day session last 5 hour include follow : - TMS measurement : A wire coil hold scalp , brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . During stimulation , subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The stimulation may cause twitch muscle face , arm , leg , subject may hear click feel pull sensation skin coil . - tDCS : Small , wet sponge electrode apply head - one eye back head . A small electrical current pass . The subject may feel itch tingle sensation electrode see light flash . Some session do sham tDCS . - Motor learn tDCS : tDCS repeat subject performs different finger movement . A new pattern finger movement taught session . - Surface electromyography : Electrodes file conductive gel tap skin one small hand muscle measure electrical activity muscle . - Behavioral measurement : Evaluation learn movement task - Questionnaires evaluate subject 's attention , fatigue mood test The second day session last 2 hour include TMS measurement behavior measurement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : Recent advance neuroscience may helpful design accurate neurorehabilitative strategy decrease post-stroke disability . First , recovery extensive interhemispheric balance activity favor ipsilesional primary motor ( M1Ipsilesional ) premotor ( PMIpsilesional ) cortex . Second , non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) M1Ipsilesional may help transiently improve motor performance stroke patient . Third , healthy volunteer , train combined cortical stimulation M1 ( play critical role motor learn ) lead up-regulation corticomotor excitability , improve motor learning , use-dependent plasticity . Since stroke patient re-learn control paretic hand , enhance learn capacity adequate tune M1Ipsilesional tDCS could promote plastic reorganization support functional improvement . Finally , another factor consider functional change elicit cortical stimulation depend previous activity state ( metaplasticity ) . Therefore , hypothesize implement metaplastic change enhance motor learning gain induce tDCS chronic stroke patient large extent control intervention stroke patient healthy volunteer . Study Population : 20 healthy subject safety issue parameter optimization ; 31 patient single cortical sub-cortical stroke ; 31 match healthy control . Design : To test hypothesis , precondition M1Ipsilesional cathodal tDCS ( transiently down-regulates activity site ) apply anodal tDCS M1Ipsilesional motor sequence learn paretic hand . After familiarization session , real sham tDCS apply 6 randomized session crossover design . Learning evaluate one day tDCS/sham session . The primary outcome measure number learn sequence correctly play keyboard 30-second period . TMS use 1 ) interfere activity different cortical motor area marker respective contribution paretic hand control metaplasticity intervention 2 ) measure corticomotor excitability change associate intervention . This provide descriptive information neural substrates underlie behavioral gain , important hypothesis-generation power analysis future investigation .</detailed_description>
