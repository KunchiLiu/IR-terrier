	<brief_summary>In early clinical study , patient lamivudine ( LAM ) switch adefovir dipivoxil ( ADV ) , patient develop ALT flare elevation ALT &gt; 10 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . There case hepatic decompensation flare , however . The transition method vary among physician overlap overlap 1 3 month LAM ADV . There still uncertainty optimal approach switch LAM ADV . This study compare safety directly switch ADV protocolled switch period overlap 12 week . This facilitate pro-active switch patient LAM also highlight genotypic resistance ahead phenotypic resistance reason switch patient . Data date present part control study patient clinically evident LAM-resistance . This study enroll patient still serum hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) DNA suppression whilst receive LAM .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Safety Switching From Lamivudine Adefovir Dipivoxil Versus Overlapping Lamivudine Adefovir Before Adefovir Dipivoxil Monotherapy Patients With Chronic Hepatitis B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic HBV infection important worldwide cause morbidity , mortality source potential new infection . There estimate 350 million carrier HBV world . In China , Southeast Asia sub-Saharan Africa , many 10-15 % population chronically infect . In North America Northern Europe , infection carrier rate much low , usually 1 % . Intermediate carrier rate 1-5 % find Southern Europe ( e.g. , Italy , Greece Spain ) , part South Central America , Middle East Japan . Persistent infection develop 90 % perinatally infected child 3-10 % people become infected age 6 year . Worldwide , estimate one million people die annually due HBV-related end stage diseases cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma . The goal antiviral therapy hepatitis B reduce patient 's risk progressive liver disease prolong suppression eradication HBV infection arrest ameliorate HBV-related liver damage .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female ≥ 18 year age chronic hepatitis B Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) ( + ) minimum 6 month prior entry Hepatitis B envelope antigen ( HBeAg ) ( + ) ( ) baseline Patients previously receive LAM least 24 week Patients compensate liver function ( ChildPugh score ≤ 6 ) Any serious active medical psychiatric illness , opinion investigator , would interfere patient treatment , assessment compliance protocol . Received immunoglobulin , interferon immune cytokinebased therapy possible activity hepatitis B disease within 6 month prior study screen . Organ bone marrow transplant recipient . Evidence active liver disease due cause ( e.g. , Wilson 's disease , hemochromatosis , autoimmune hepatitis , hepatitis C hepatitis D coinfection ) Patients take parenteral ( intravenous intramuscular subcutaneous ) oral steroid , immunosuppressant therapy chemotherapeutic agent within 2 month study screen expect receive agent course study . Previous participation investigational trial involve administration investigational compound within 2 month prior study screen receive antiHBV therapy lamivudine within previous 3 month ( e.g . anabolic steroid , ketaconazole , itraconazole , isoniazid , rifampin , rifabutin , simvastatin , lovastatin ) Clinically relevant alcohol drug use history alcohol drug use consider investigator sufficient hinder compliance treatment , follow procedure evaluation adverse event Lactating female female positive serum pregnancy test . Females childbearing potential ( postpuberty ) unwilling unable pregnancy test study visit Therapy nephrotoxic drug ( e.g . aminoglycosides , amphotericin B , vancomycin , cidofovir , foscarnet , cisplatin pentamidine , tacrolimus , cyclosporine ) competitor renal excretion ( e.g . probenecid ) within 2 month prior study screen expectation subject receive course study . The use antiviral therapy agent demonstrate potential antiHBV activity lamivudine within previous 3 month ( e.g . famciclovir , lobucavir , emtricitabine , DAPD , LFMAU , entecavir , ganciclovir others ) . History hypersensitivity nucleoside and/or nucleotide analogue . Clinical , ultrasonographic radiologic evidence hepatic mass suggestive hepatocellular carcinoma . Serum alphafetoprotein ( AFP ) &gt; 50 ng/mL first screen visit . However , AFP level &gt; 50 ng/mL first screen visit , remain stable decreased 6 month precede first screen visit , radiologic ultrasonic evidence hepatic mass ( e ) suggestive hepatocellular carcinoma , patient allow enroll . Inability comply study requirement .</criteria>
