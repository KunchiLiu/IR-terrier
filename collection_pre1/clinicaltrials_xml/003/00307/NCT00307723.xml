	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety bevacizumab , oxaliplatin , 5-FU , gemcitabine combination external beam radiation therapy ( Phase I portion ) well begin collect information whether combination treatment effective treating patient locally advanced pancreatic cancer ( Phase II portion ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Bevacizumab Combination With 5-FU , Oxaliplatin External Beam Radiation Followed Gemcitabine Bevacizumab Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The combination three drug radiation treatment never give people , therefore , go add one additional drug time safety reason . - The first group participant ( 3-4 ) enroll study receive 5-FU , radiation therapy add drug oxaliplatin , call Regimen level 1 . If participant easily manageable side effect , another group participants enrolled receive 5-FU , radiation , oxaliplatin addition bevacizumab call Regimen level 2 . - The combination study drug radiation last 6 week , 6 week period call cycle 1 . - Regimen Level 1 receive following : oxaliplatin intravenously day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 ; 5-FU infused continuous infusion day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 , 36-38 ; radiation therapy Monday-Friday complete day 38 . - Regimen Level 2 receive following ; bevacizumab intravenously day 1 , 15 , 29 ; oxaliplatin intravenously day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 36 ; 5-FU infused continuous infusion day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 , 29-33 , 36-38 ; radiation therapy Monday-Friday complete day day 38 . - The following test procedure perform cycle 1 : physical examination ; blood work , urine sample . perfusion CT scan day 12 ( participant enrol Massachusetts General Hospital ) . - At end cycle 1 , CT scan perform evaluate participant disease status receive combination gemcitabine bevacizumab . If scan show tumor reduce size surgically remove , surgery schedule patient receive gemcitabine bevacizumab 4 week surgery . If scan show tumor remove , patient receive gemcitabine/bevacizumab combination 4 week complete cycle 1 . - Cycles 2-5 consist : gemcitabine give intravenously day 1 , 8 , 15 every 28 day ; bevacizumab give intravenously day 1 15 every 28 day . During cycle 2-5 follow test procedure perform : physical examination include vital sign day 1 15 cycle ; blood work day 1 , 8 15 cycle ; urine sample day 1 cycle ; CT scan do every 2 cycle . - It take 7 month complete study treatment ( longer surgery Cycle 1 ) .</detailed_description>
