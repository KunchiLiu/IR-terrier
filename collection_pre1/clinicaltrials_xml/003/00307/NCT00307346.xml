	<brief_summary>This study compare electroencephalograph ( EEG ) record healthy volunteer people movement disorder examine brain activity associate weakness . EEG record electrical activity brain ( `` brain wave '' ) . Healthy volunteer patient arm leg weakness 18 80 year age may eligible study . Healthy subject screen medical history , physical neurological examination , questionnaire . They must right-handed never neurological disease head trauma . All participant EEG . An elastic cap electrode place subject 's scalp record brain 's electrical activity . During EEG , subject require resist force arm , elbow , shoulder leg long . Several recording do short break .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective Give way weakness symptom often associate psychogenic etiology , neurophysiological basis poorly understood . Our objective study identify cerebral mechanism give way weakness . Study population We study 6 patient give way weakness 6 healthy volunteer age 18 year old old . Design In study , patient try resist examiner 's force subsequently give way . Electroencephalography ( EEG ) record maneuver perform repeatedly . Outcome measure Movement-related cortical potential ( MRCP ) analysis perform data amplitude ( volt ) latency ( second ) individual patient describe contrast data obtain healthy volunteer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Both patient healthy volunteer age 18 80 . Patients evaluate Human Motor Control Clinic NINDS . The definite diagnosis disease may completely establish time record . Patients clear reproducible symptom give way weakness either upper low extremity . Patients able resist examiner least two second give way . Healthy volunteer right hand adult without history neurological disease severe head trauma . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects ( patient volunteer ) understand instruction consent form protocol exclude . Subjects follow instruction entire recording whatever reason exclude . Patients document organic central nervous system lesion may exclude study . This discussed detail individual subject Human Motor Control Clinic .</criteria>
