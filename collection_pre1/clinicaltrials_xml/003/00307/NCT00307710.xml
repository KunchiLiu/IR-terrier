	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To assess trend immunogenic response across patient administer either licensed trivalent inactivate influenza vaccine ( TIV ) one three dos ( 15 , 45 135 μg ) trivalent recombinant baculovirus express hemagglutinin vaccine . Immunogenic response define 4-fold great increase serum antibody . Secondary Objective : To determine safety tolerability 3 dos ( 15 μg HA per virus , 45 μg HA per virus , 135 μg HA per virus ) recombinant baculovirus-expressed HA vaccine patient non-Hodgkin 's B-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Influenza common respiratory infection cause virus . Standard influenza vaccine may effective protect cancer patient general population get influenza . New technology develop allows strong ( hopefully effective ) influenza vaccine develop . This research study test experimental influenza vaccine . If agree take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) receive either standard inactivate influenza vaccine one three dos experimental vaccine . You equal chance assign four treatment group . Neither physician , study doctor , know vaccine dose receive . In case emergency , study doctor find vaccine dose receive . Before injection give , blood test take measure antibody ( substance fight infection ) . About two teaspoon blood take blood test . The vaccine give one time injection arm . After give injection , observe 20 minute clinic send home . Everyone take part study ask keep symptom diary temperature log 1 week injection . After 7 day , return review diary symptom may . At 4 8 week influenza vaccine give , patient blood test learn amount immunity influenza virus develop . About two teaspoon blood require test . A patient may eligible eight week blood collection instruct study nurse future visit UTMDACC . Six month receive vaccine , contact one study personnel ask serious side effect might study vaccine . Once receive follow-up telephone call , participation study complete . This investigational study . The standard vaccine use study FDA approve commercially available . The experimental vaccine authorize use research . About 100 patient take part study . All enrol UTMDACC . This protocol partially fund research contract National Institutes Health ( NIH ) Baylor College Medicine .</detailed_description>
