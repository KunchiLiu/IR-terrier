	<brief_summary>Primary : To determine effectiveness rectal trumpet compare standard care maintain skin integrity patient fecal incontinence . Hypothesis ( H1 ) : There difference failure rate rectal area skin integrity subject receive rectal trumpet receive treatment usual ( staqndard care ) . Secondary : To determine ease use , cost-effectiveness , level patient comfort rectal trumpet compare standard care patient fecal incontinence . Secondary ( exploratory ) hypotheses : There difference ease use device , cost device , patient comfort relative device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Rectal Trumpet Standard Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Method : Subjects : A convenience sample 80 adult male female patient Wilmington Intensive Care Unit ( WICU ) , Surgical Critical Care Center ( SCCC ) , Medical Intensive Care Unit ( MICU ) , 6D Step-Down , TSU , 5A , 5E/W , recruit . After obtain informed consent , subject randomize one two group ( experimental : rectal trumpet standard treatment : Hollister fecal incontinent collector ) . Inclusion Criteria : Patients meet follow criterion : 1 . Diarrhea - two episode loose watery stool 12 hour period 2 . ≥ 18 year age 3 . English-speaking patient guardian 4 . Intact skin , may discolor without breakdown 5 . Doctor 's order rectal trumpet ( randomized treatment group ) Exclusion Criteria : Patients exclude study follow present : 1. prolapse anal sphincter 2. active rectal bleed 3. colorectal cancer 4. bleeding precaution 5. rectal tone rat 1 ( gap ) 2 ( lax ) Instruments : The data collection instrument use study investigator-developed ( see Appendix A - Data Collection Tool ) . Data collect study unit nurse baseline , every eight hour , PRN throughout duration study . Data subject identification remove subject number assign . Digital picture patient identify mark ( e.g. , tattoo , birthmark , piercings ) mark edit . Procedure : A comparison study conduct . The staff nurse identify patient two great episode loose watery stool 12 hour period contact study team . Study team member determine patient meet additional inclusion criterion # 2 , # 3 , # 4 , # 5 exclusion criterion # 1 , # 2 # 3 . Once determine , study team member approach patient family consent participate study . After consent obtain , study team member evaluate patient remain exclusion criterion ( # 4 ) . Rectal tone assess rat performing digital rectal exam . If assess tone rat gaping ( 1 ) lax ( 2 ) , patient exclude study . Patients meet study criterion randomize either rectal trumpet group standard treatment . The Numeric Pain Intensity Scale ( 0-10 ) staff observation physiological indicator ( e.g. , restlessness , sweat , tachycardia , lacrimation , pupil dilatation , poor ventilator synchrony ) disorient unresponsive patient use prior immediately placement either device order ass patient comfort . Comfort assess every 8 hour orient patient use Numeric Pain Intensity Scale . For placement rectal trumpet ( Rusch nasopharyngeal airway-32FR ) : Patient 's skin cleanse Smith Nephew Personal cleanser rinse thoroughly water remove soap residue dry . Apply 3M sting barrier film provide skin protectant . Attach shaft end trumpet urinary drainage bag . Using hemostat , clamp tube beneath sample port drainage bag . Instill 5cc mineral oil flange end trumpet , careful fill spill mineral oil onto flange . Release clamp allow mineral oil drain urinary drainage bag . If possible , place patient side-lying position knee draw toward chest . Fold flange quarter , insert rectum . Pull back gently slight resistance . Secure drainage bag bed frame . Drainage tubing position prevent tension pull trumpet . Staff educate proper placement device need reapplication/reinsertion either device prior study initiation . Education provide staff follow unit : SCCC , MICU , 6DSD , WICU . Study patient assess every 8 hour PRN sign skin breakdown , stool leakage around device , dislodgement , discomfort device use Numeric Pain Intensity Scale orient patient . Failure fecal incontinent collector include : leakage within 24 hour application X 2 attempt placement , skin breakdown . Failure rectal trumpet include : leakage X 2 around trumpet proper position within 24 hour period , skin breakdown , expel trumpet continuation diarrhea X 3 24 hour period , orient patient , assess discomfort every 8 hour , rate discomfort 2 point previous rating level discomfort request removal device due discomfort . Selected digital picture patient ' skin take establish inter-rater reliability respect skin assessment provide photographic evidence skin maintenance , healing , failure use either device . A representative Medical Photography department instruct investigator digital photograph patient ' skin . Completion trial return continence , stool become form , discharge unit study , 14 day whichever come first .</detailed_description>
