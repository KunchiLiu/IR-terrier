	<brief_summary>The purpose SPIRIT IV Clinical Trial continue evaluate safety efficacy XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System ( XIENCE V® ) . The XIENCE V® arm compare active control , represent FDA-approved TAXUS® EXPRESS2™ Paclitaxel-Eluting Coronary Stent System ( TAXUS® ) , commercially available Boston Scientific . TAXUS® EXPRESS2™ Paclitaxel Eluting Coronary Stent System manufacture Boston Scientific .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SPIRIT IV Clinical Trial : Clinical Evaluation XIENCE V® Everolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The completion SPIRIT IV clinical trial three year justified consistent long-term clinical evidence support safety efficacy XIENCE V EECSS complex , real-world patient across multiple geography . As SPIRIT IV design continued access trial , complete clinical follow-up three-year visit conflict FDA requirement . Abbott Vascular commit provide clinical outcome three year . The clinical evidence provide across multiple geography , complex population thus support Abbott Vascular 's proposal complete SPIRIT IV RCT three-year clinical follow-up . The SPIRIT IV Clinical Trial randomize , active-controlled , single-blinded , multicenter clinical trial US enroll approximately 3,690 subject ( 2:1 randomization XIENCE V® : TAXUS® ) . The trial allow treatment three de novo native coronary artery lesion , maximum two lesion per epicardial vessel , reference vessel diameter ( RVD ) ≥ 2.5 mm ≤ 4.25 mm lesion length ≤ 28 mm . ( NOTE : RVD ≥ 2.5 mm ≤ 3.75 mm 4.0 mm TAXUS® commercially available ) . All subject screen per protocol inclusion exclusion criterion enrol subject clinical follow-up 30 , 180 , 270 day 1 , 2 , 3 year .</detailed_description>
