	<brief_summary>This trial aim evaluate difference effectiveness two therapy method patient acute stroke . The aim use Navigated Brain Stimulation ( NBS ) analyze change brain network recovery consequence rehabilitation . The group : - body-weight supported gate trainer rehabilitation - gait-oriented traditional physiotherapy Patients physiotherapy group 75 min physiotherapy daily every workday . This include 20 minute walk exercise traditional group 20 minute gait trainer therapy gait trainer group . The evaluation effectiveness therapy group make three week ' therapy six month . The goal 40 patient end June 2006 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study start 2003 randomized study compare rehabilitation gait trainer traditional gait-oriented physiotherapy . * From begin 2005 , patient evaluate use NBS ( Navigating Brain Stimulation ) , magnetic stimulation device . This stimulation perform day 3 , 10 15 6 month . - The total number patient recruit study 57 , seventeen ( 17 ) patient gait trainer group twenty ( 20 ) patient group traditional physiotherapy . From year 2005 onwards , ten ( 10 control patient recruit . Those patient select exactly criterion include treatment group . The control patient exactly evaluation time point , rehabilitation take place accord principle obey neurology clinic . Thus , randomise two treatment group . - Since start study , ten ( 10 ) patient withdraw study various reason ( drop out ) . One patient randomization , 5 patient gait trainer group , one patient traditional physiotherapy group 3 patient control group . - Thus , final group consist 17 patient gait trainer group , 20 patient traditional therapy group 10 patient control group . - There 25 patient underwent whole procedure NBS : 9 patient gait trainer group , 8 patient traditional therapy group 8 patient control group . The last 6-month follow-up take place late August/early September 2007 . The idea combine navigated magnetic brain stimulation ( NBS ) rehabilitation intervention study evaluate change brain network recovery process , see possible difference network due different rehabilitation method and/or good vs. poor recovery . In connection magnetic stimulation , 60-channel EEG map take order measure electrical spread induce neural electrical activity , describes state connection damage brain area part brain well possible activation new neural connection . This arrangement allow unique opportunity study re-organisation brain structure stroke brain plasticity general recover brain . For evaluation functional recovery , combination relevant scale motor function measure study . Those : Rivermead Mobility Index , Rivermead Motor Assessment , Modified Motor Assessment Scale , Functional ambulation Category , Physical Cost Index , 6-minute walking time . In addition , Barthel index , Scandinavian Stroke Scale NIH Scale perform begin end .</detailed_description>
