	<brief_summary>This study enroll 460 subject new pulmonary infiltrates ICU stay low risk pneumonia , determine use Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score ( CPIS ) . The study design determine whether 3 day antibiotic treatment meropenem ( without coverage MRSA ) ICU subject diagnose new pulmonary infiltrates reduce emergence anti-microbial-resistant organisms isolation potential pathogen compare standard course antibiotic therapy ( minimum 8 day therapy antibiotic primary care team 's choosing ) . Subjects randomly place either meropenem group standard antibiotic therapy group . The study also examine whether short-course therapy reduces hospital length stay hospital cost , without negative effect subject morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparative Antibiotic Therapy Subjects With Pulmonary Infiltrates ICU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intensive care unit ( ICUs ) frequently identify source nosocomial infection within hospital , infection rate antimicrobial resistance rate significantly high general ward . In one study , antimicrobial use report 10 time higher ICU compare antimicrobial use general ward . Although antibiotic give variety condition , antibiotic prescribe respiratory infection , suspect proven , account almost one-half antibiotic consumption ICU . Importantly , use antimicrobial agent identify critical risk factor emergence resistant bacterial infection . By identify focus subset subject unlikely infection therefore unlikely benefit antibiotic , antibiotic use subsequent emergence antimicrobial-resistant organism could limit . This Phase III , multi-center , randomize , open-label study design determine whether 3 day antibiotic treatment meropenem ( without coverage MRSA ) ICU subject diagnose new pulmonary infiltrates reduce emergence antimicrobial-resistant organisms isolation potential pathogen compare standard course antibiotic therapy ( minimum 8 day therapy antibiotic primary care team 's choosing ) . The primary objective study compare risk resistant infection ICU evaluate difference incidence either emergence antimicrobial-resistant bacteria isolation potential pathogen ICU subject receive short-course empiric antibiotic therapy ICU subject receive standard antibiotic therapy treatment pulmonary infiltrates ( low likelihood pneumonia ) . Secondary objective : 1 ) ass mortality subject receive short-course empiric antibiotic therapy compare standard antibiotic therapy ; 2 ) ass ICU length stay ( LOS ) subject receive short-course empiric antibiotic therapy compare standard antibiotic therapy ; 3 ) ass hospital LOS subject receive short-course empiric antibiotic therapy compare standard antibiotic therapy ; 4 ) ass cost antibiotic therapy subject receive short-course empiric antibiotic therapy compare standard antibiotic therapy . The cost base ICU LOS , hospital LOS , antibiotic treatment , standard cost related treatment infection-related adverse experience ; 5 ) ass risk clinically significant infection subject receive short-course empiric antibiotic therapy compare standard antibiotic therapy . This study enroll 460 subject new pulmonary infiltrates ICU stay low risk pneumonia , determine use Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score ( CPIS ) .</detailed_description>
