	<brief_summary>There continue debate whether use hetastarch volume replacement coronary artery bypass surgery [ CABG ] increase risk postoperative bleeding . A recent meta-analysis hetastarch use on-pump CABG conclude use hetastarch procedure associate increased risk , safety hetastarch use off-pump procedure remain unresolved . We design double-blinded randomized clinical trial investigate question . The study design equivalence trial . Statistical power calculation perform take consideration . Sealed assignment block randomization table develop prior nto initiation trial unseal operating room . These used assign patient schedule off-pump CABG receive either 1 L hetastarch 1 L albumin part intraoperative volume replacement . Albumin use subsequent intraoperative postoperative fluid replacement . The rate postoperative bleeding assess prospectively monitor hourly chest tube drainage number unit blood product transfuse postoperatively Intensive Care Unit . Risk assess Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMC ) establish trial . The SAMC schedule per protocol meet first 15 subject ( group combine ) 1000cc chest tube drainage first 12 hour postoperative , subsequently either 15 additional bleeds volume follow schedule set discretion DSMC . The trial continue 156 patient recruit . At time , 78 participant assign hetastarch albumin group . DSMC review time determine use hetastarch associate risk postoperative bleeding great risk associate use albumin DSMC accordingly halt trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment 1 . Eligibility screening : . All adult Kaiser Permanente member admit Summit Hospital ( Oakland , CA ) coronary bypass graft surgery plan conduct off-pump . 2 . Recruitment period : 9/1/2004 7/27/05 1 . At recruitment , subject agrees participate assign study number 1 . The study number assign sequentially totally independent medical record number personal identifying information 2 . The linkage study number personal identifying information keep lock file separate project data 3 . Exclusion criterion : 1. pregnancy 2. patient schedule undergo on-pump procedure 3. patient history : 1. cardiac surgery 2. primary bleed disorder 3. end-stage renal disease . 4 . Statistical power analysis 1 . This study design equivalence trial 2 . Target outcome rate base publish Sade RM , Stroud MR , Crawford FA Jr , et al . J Thorac Cardiovasc Surg 1985 May ; 89 ( 5 ) :713-22 . 3 . Statistical power calculate use confidence-interval-based technique normally distribute interval variable . 1 . The confidence interval set 95 % 2 . The range equivalence define +100 milliliter 3 . Power set 90 % 4 . The target sample size result analysis 165 patient arm ( i.e. , hetastarch albumin ) . 5 . Analytic strategy 1 . All project analyse conduct intention-to-treat 2 . Bivariate comparison study ( i.e. , hetastarch ) control ( i.e. , albumin ) group measurement use Fisher exact test Student â€™ test independent sample appropriate give nature measurement use conduct bivariate comparison study group measure control group measure . 1 ) Confidence interval calculate use exact technique 3 . Multivariate comparison : Analysis variance general linear modeling use conduct multivariate comparison measure study control group control covariates . 6 . Intervention process 1 . When patient operating room , anesthesiologist open envelope contain study group assignment ( i.e. , hetastarch albumin ) . 1 . The attend anesthesiologist administers 1 liter 6 % hetastarch intraoperatively patient study group . 2 . The attend anesthesiologist administers 1 liter albumin intraoperatively patient study group . 2 . After first liter colloid administer , patient receive albumin colloid need meet additional requirement fluid replacement . 3 . All patient receive remain standard operative regimen crystalloids blood product discretion anesthesiologist . 4 . All patient transfer postoperatively Intensive Care Unit . 1 . The attend intensivists blind patient 's randomization assignment 2 . The attend intensivists use standard fluid replacement clinical discretion . 3 . No hetastarch administer intensive care unit . 7 . Measurements 1 . Preoperative 1. age 2. gender 3. body mass index 4. type surgery ) ( elective vs. urgent/emergent ) 5. serum albumin level 6. serum creatinine level 7. blood urea nitrogen level 8. hematocrit 9. platelet count 10. prothrombin time 11. partial thromboplastin time 12. preoperative administration anticoagulant 13. preoperative administration antiplatelet medication 14. preoperative administration thrombolytic agent 2 .
