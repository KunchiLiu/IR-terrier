	<brief_summary>This trial perform evaluate safety efficacy G-CSF base stem cell therapy patient AMI . MAGIC Cell-1 trial enrol patient acute old myocardial infarction , two group cell infusion , G-CSF alone . MAGIC Cell-2 trial enrol patient acute myocardial infarction present within 12 hour onset chest pain underwent successful primary PCI . We randomize patient G-CSF group control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We compare intra-coronary infusion mobilize PBSCs G-CSF ( n=10 ) mobilization alone G-CSF ( n=10 ) patient myocardial infarction MAGIC Cell -1 trial G-CSF alone ( n=6 ) control ( n=6 ) MAGIC Cell-2 trial . This study randomize , control phase II clinical trial . The Institutional Review Board Seoul National University Hospital approve study protocol . The informed write consent obtain patient explain procedure risk . This study consist 2 sub-studies ; MAGIC Cell ( Myocardial Regeneration Angiogenesis Myocardial Infarction G-CSF Intra-Coronary Stem Cell Infusion ) –1 2 trial . In brief , MAGIC Cell-1 trial enrol patient acute old myocardial infarction , two group cell infusion , G-CSF alone . PBSCs mobilize daily subcutaneous injection G-CSF ( Dong-A pharmaceutical , Seoul , Korea ) 10 g/kg body weight four day percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . After completion G-CSF injection , patient underwent PCI implantation stent culprit lesion infarct relate artery . Immediately PCI , patient cell infusion group receive intra-coronary infusion collect PBSC , mobilize collect PCI . The enrollment patient MAGIC Cell-1 trial terminate prematurely due potential adverse reaction increase restenosis . However , follow enrol patient complete 1 year schedule . MAGIC Cell-2 trial enrol patient acute myocardial infarction present within 12 hour onset chest pain underwent successful primary PCI . We randomize patient G-CSF group control group . The patient G-CSF group receive G-CSF 10 g/kg body weight four day least 24hours primary PCI . The enrollment patient MAGIC Cell-2 trial also terminate prematurely due potential adverse reaction increase restenosis report MAGIC Cell-1 trial . However , follow enrol patient also complete 1 year schedule</detailed_description>
