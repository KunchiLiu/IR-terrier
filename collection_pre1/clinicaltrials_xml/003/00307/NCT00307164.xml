	<brief_title>Effects Uridine Supplement HIV Infected Adults With Lipoatrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lipoatrophy distress long-term complication ART associate decrease quality life , increase risk cardiovascular disease , nonadherence ART . The cause lipoatrophy HIV-infected individual receive ART completely understand . However , past research suggest mitochondrial toxicity subcutaneous adipose tissue cause thymidine analogue nucleoside analogue may responsible development lipoatrophy . Uridine nucleoside show effective supplement treat individual mitochondrial toxicity . NucleomaxX food supplement consist mitocnol , sugar cane extract high content nucleoside , include uridine . The purpose study evaluate effect uridine supplementation form NucleomaxX limb fat HIV-infected individual receive stable ART contain stavudine ( d4T ) zidovudine ( ZDV ) . In addition , study evaluate safety tolerability NucleomaxX . This study last 48 week . Participants randomly assign one two treatment arm , stratify d4T ZDV use . Arm A participant receive NucleomaxX uridine , Arm B participant receive placebo NucleomaxX . Participants arm receive assigned intervention three time per day , every day , duration study . There 8 study visit 48-week study duration . Blood collection physical exam occur study visit , participant complete adherence assessment visit . Participants underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry scan ( DEXA ) within 14 day prior follow screen visit select visit . Specific fast test glucose lipid level occur select visit . ART provide study .</detailed_description>
