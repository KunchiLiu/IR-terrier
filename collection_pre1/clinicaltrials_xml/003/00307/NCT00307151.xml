	<brief_summary>A single dose nevirapine ( SD NVP ) give HIV infect pregnant woman follow single dose infant show effective way reduce risk mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HIV . The purpose study compare effectiveness non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) -based antiretroviral regimen versus protease inhibitor ( PI ) -based regimen HIV infect infant expose SD NVP prevention MTCT . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A five year follow add study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antiviral Responses NNRTI-Based vs. PI-Based ARV Therapy HIV Infected Infants Who Have Have Not Received Single Dose NVP Prevention Mother-to-Child Transmission HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single dose nevirapine ( SD NVP ) greatly reduce rate mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) HIV . Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) -based regimen recommend use World Health Organization ( WHO ) resource-limited setting . However , research suggest mother infant expose SD NVP experience high virologic failure rate treat NNRTI-based regimen unexposed counterpart . Data show use SD NVP associate NNRTI resistance HIV infect woman infant . The purpose trial compare evaluate virologic response NNRTI-based regimen versus protease-inhibitor ( PI ) -based regimen HIV infect infant expose SD NVP intrapartum birth . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Participants enrol one two Cohorts propose enrollment Cohort 288 participant . Cohort I participant must receive SD NVP prevention MTCT . Cohort II participants mother must previously receive NVP NNRTIs . Participants Cohorts randomly assign receive either NNRTI ( Coh I : NVP Coh II : NVP ) PI ( Coh I : LPV/r Coh II : LPV/r ) -based regimen . The NNRTI-based regimen include NVP , zidovudine ( ZDV ) lamivudine ( 3TC ) . The PI-based regimen include lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) , ZDV 3TC . If participant experience adverse reaction ZDV , stavudine ( d4T ) could substitute . Randomization stratify age ( 6- &lt; 12 month vs. &gt; =12 month , 2- &lt; 6 month stratum add protocol version 4.0 low age limit decrease 6 month 2 month ) . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Study visit schedule entry , week 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 every 24 week . A physical exam , blood collection , assessments HIV-related symptom occur visit . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Based Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMB ) review study data April 20 2009 , enrollment Cohort I close interim result release . Data another similar study ( AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( ACTG ) A5208 ) conduct mother , show PI-based regimen effective NNRTI-based regimen infant receive SD NVP prevention MTCT . Cohort II allow remain open enrollment low age limit enrollment reduce 6 month 2 month . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In June 2010 , follow-up subject extend original 24 week beyond enrollment last subject 48 week . On October 27 2010 , DSMB conduct final review Cohort II data , recommend result unblinded release . As found Cohort I , PI-based regimen effective NNRTI-based regimen infant previously expose SD NVP PMTCT . Primary secondary outcome result Cohort I include follow-up April 20 , 2009 Cohort II , follow-up October 27 , 2010 . Adverse event summary use follow-up randomized study treatment regimen Cohorts October 27 , 2010 . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Version 5.0 protocol ( March 21 , 2011 ) extend follow-up subject additional 5 year March 2016 . The purpose extension collect long term safety virologic efficacy data study population pilot administration series neuropsychological test . During extension , participant receive medication study , instead local clinic . Clinic visit take place every 3 month . &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</detailed_description>

Subjects active opportunistic infection eligible study participation treat clinically stable Parent legal guardian willing provide sign informed consent Inclusion Criteria Cohort I : Documentation maternal infant NVP exposure highly reliable verbal report . ( Updated protocol version 2.0 , LOA # 3 require write clinic/hospital documentation infant exposure SD NVP ) Use maternal ARV , include NVP , permit pregnancy One following : strict formula feeding , initial infant HIV diagnosis occur young 60 day age , initial AIDSdefining illness diagnosis WHO criteria young 60 day age . Inclusion Criteria Cohort II : &gt; &gt; Use maternal ARVs , exclude NNRTIs , permit pregnancy Evidence lack prior NVP exposure ( add protocol version 2.0 , LOA # 3 ) review maternal child medical record health card ( write documentation ) evidence NVP exposure mother infant pregnancy , labor , delivery . If write documentation show lack NVP use show record record available review , verbal report consider highly reliable study nurse acceptable AND one following : 1 . Study subject bear single dose NVP available prevention MTCT HIV location birth study subject &gt; &gt; 2 . Study subject bear biological mother 's first positive HIV test &gt; &gt; 3 . Site staff another reason believe subject expose NVP &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Exclusion Criteria All Participants : Grade 2 high aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) study screen &gt; &gt; Grade 3 high laboratory toxicity study screen &gt; &gt; Received ARVs anything prevention intrapartum MTCT . Infants receive ARVs first week life ( e.g. , prevention MTCT HIV breastfeed ) exclude Acute serious infection require active treatment . Subjects could receive treatment active TB include rifamycin drug Receiving chemotherapy active tumor &gt; &gt; History cardiac conduction abnormality underlie structural heart disease Required certain medication Exclusion Criteria Cohort I : History currently breastfeed . Breastfed infant positive HIV test experience AIDSdefining illness WHO criteria 60 day age young exclude Exclusion Criteria Cohort II : Exposure maternal NVP NNRTI prior pregnancy breastfeed Exposure infant NVP time include first week life</criteria>
