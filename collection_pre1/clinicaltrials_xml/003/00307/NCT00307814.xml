	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Maintenance Phase Treatment Patients With Anemia Due Chronic Kidney Disease ( PROMPT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epoetin alfa widely utilized treatment anemia associate Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) . Epoetin alfa show increase hemoglobin ( Hb ) level average 1.5 g/dL 2 g/dL patient 12 week ( Data file Ortho Biotech Products , L.P. ) . This improvement Hb level maintain patient receive Epoetin alfa associate significant improvement survival , exercise tolerance , quality life . Literature suggest epoetin alfa give less frequently still maintain optimal hemoglobin also allow patient 's great convenience . This study confirm le frequent dosing epoetin alfa safe effective . This open-label , randomized multicenter study patient CKD . CKD patient currently receive PROCRIT therapy least 2 month stable Hb ( &gt; = 11g/dL ) randomize one four treatment group . A stable Hemoglobin define value ± 10 % 3 consecutive laboratory value . This study design demonstrate meaningful difference hemoglobin level extend dose regimen compare weekly . A clinically meaningful difference define difference le 10 % . Patients randomize one 4 treatment group : All receive subcutaneous ( skin ) Epoetin alfa period 16 week . Group 1 : 10,000 unit every week Group 2 : 20,000 unit every two week Group 3 : 30,000 unit every three week Group 4 : 40,000 unit every four week</detailed_description>
