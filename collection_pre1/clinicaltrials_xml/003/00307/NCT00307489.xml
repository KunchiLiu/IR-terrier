	<brief_summary>This study explore efficacy , safety tolerability tenofovir DF ( TDF ) 300 mg daily monotherapy versus combination emtricitabine 200 mg plus tenofovir DF 300 mg ( FTC/TDF ) daily subject currently treat adefovir dipivoxil ( Hepsera ) chronic hepatitis B persistent viral replication ( detectable hepatitis B virus deoxyribonucleic acid [ HBV DNA ] ) . Subjects confirm ( within 4 week ) plasma HBV DNA ≥ 400 copies/mL double blind treatment Week 24 time thereafter option receive 12 week open-label FTC/TDF may continue end 168-week treatment period virologic response ( HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL ) . Alternatively , subject confirm HBV DNA &lt; 400 copies/mL time Week 24 double-blind treatment may continue blind therapy Week 168 discretion investigator . If , investigator 's opinion , felt continue blind treatment beyond 24 week subject confirm HBV DNA ≥ 400 copies/mL beneficial , subject may discontinue study begin commercially available HBV therapy rather initiate open-label FTC/TDF .</brief_summary>
