	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether treatment rituximab ( anti-CD20 , Rituxan® , MabThera® ) individual develop new anti-HLA antibody renal ( kidney ) transplant promote longer-term survival transplant kidney.The pilot study compare use rituximab ( Rituxan® ) + site-specific standard immunosuppression placebo + site-specific standard immunosuppression treatment circulate anti-HLA antibody subject develop de novo anti-HLA antibody 3-36 month transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Organ rejection occur patient 's body recognize new organ attack . Data suggest development anti-human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) antibodies early clinical indication organ rejection may occur . Rituximab genetically engineer monoclonal antibody direct CD20 antigen B cell know deplete B cell administer intravenously ; FDA-approved treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ; Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) ; Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) combination methotrexate adult patient moderately-to severely-active RA inadequate response one TNF antagonist therapy . In previous small study , kidney transplant patient either acute humoral rejection ( AHR ) chronic humoral rejection ( CHR ) give rituximab antilymphocyte therapy . Patients AHR lower undetectable level circulate anti-HLA antibody study treatment , patient CHR sustain decrease anti-HLA antibody undetectable 6 9 month . This study evaluate safety efficacy rituximab 1 . ) prevent organ rejection 2 . ) promote long-term survival donor kidney people undergo kidney transplantation . This study involve two stage : 1 . Stage 1 begin 3 36 month transplant . During Stage 1 , blood collection occur every 3 month 36 month transplant test anti-HLA antibody . When antibody detect twice within 1 month , patient undergo baseline kidney biopsy glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) measure determine kidney function . If patient meet certain study criterion , enter Stage 2 ( Pilot Treatment Study ) . If anti-HLA antibody detect patient 's blood Stage 1 , patient 's participation complete . 2 . In Stage 2 , patient receive site-specific standard immunosuppression plus randomization either rituximab placebo : - Adult dosing ( &gt; 18 year age ) , receive intravenous infusion 1000mg rituximab Days 0 14 . - Pediatric dosing ( &lt; \= 18 year age ) receive intravenous infusion 375 mg/m^2/dose ( maximum 500 mg/dose ) 4 dos rituximab Days 0 , 8 , 15 22 . Adult participant 7-9 study visit 12-24 month . Pediatric participant 9-11 study visit 12-24 month . A physical exam , medication history , adverse event assessment , blood urine collection occur visit . A biopsy kidney transplant occur Stage 2 entry Month 12 . Note : Prior January 2010 , Stage 2 double-blind ( double-masked ) randomize pilot treatment study . As January 2010 beyond : - subject longer recruited placebo treatment arm - treatment assignment unblinded open-label design commence ; therefore , medication assignment open study participant well site clinical team . - study subject participate study prior change inform change - subject randomize placebo-controlled arm continue meet pilot study eligibility criterion provide option participate pilot treatment study .</detailed_description>
