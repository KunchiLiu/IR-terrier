	<brief_title>Effect Growth Hormone Metabolic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome , constellation glucose intolerance , hypertension , dyslipidemia , obesity , pro-inflammatory prothrombotic state culminating development premature cardiovascular disease serious public health problem significant impact life expectancy , societal productivity quality life afflict . Insulin resistance propose key link factor metabolic syndrome . Although underlying mechanism development insulin resistance , diabetes metabolic syndrome fully understood , increase evidence suggest neurohormonal dysregulation play pivotal role cause grow health hazard . In previous study 307 middle-aged men , low insulin-like growth factor ( IGF ) -1 level independently associate insulin resistance metabolic syndrome , especially amongst positive family history diabetes . Replacement growth hormone show researcher reduce body fat improve metabolic profile patient adult growth hormone deficiency type 2 diabetes . We hypothesize treatment growth hormone lead reduction body fat , insulin resistance cardiovascular risk factor men metabolic syndrome . This 12-month prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study use growth hormone treatment middle-aged men metabolic syndrome . The primary outcome measure body fat distribution , include change visceral mesenteric fat , whereas secondary outcome measure insulin sensitivity , tertiary outcome variable parameter metabolic syndrome . The result study important impact treatment patient metabolic syndrome , understanding role growth hormone pathogenesis insulin resistance , diabetes metabolic syndrome .</detailed_description>
