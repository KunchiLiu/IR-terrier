	<brief_summary>The primary objective study : - To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) bortezomib combination high-dose melphalan condition regimen . - To determine safety , tolerability , response rate bortezomib give combination high-dose melphalan , condition regimen , tandem transplant patient primary refractory multiple myeloma plasma cell leukemia . The secondary objective study : - To determine gene expression profile ( pharmacogenomics ) perform RTPCR Fanconi anemia pathway gene , prior treatment bortezomib , patient primary refractory multiple myeloma plasma cell leukemia correlate profile responses treatment . - To determine time disease progression overall survival patient primary refractory multiple myeloma plasma cell leukemia treat bortezomib follow tandem autologous transplantation - To determine response rate 2 cycle bortezomib patient primary refractory multiple myeloma plasma cell leukemia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Followed High-Dose Melphalan Bortezomib Conditioning Regimen Tandem Stem Cell Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients primary refractory multiple myeloma plasma cell leukemia either newly diagnose previously treat receive 2-cycles standard dose bortezomib follow high-dose melphalan bortezomib condition regimen prior tandem autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( PBSCT ) . Following treatment two cycle standard dose bortezomib , sequential cohort patient give escalate bortezomib dos combine standard constant conditioning regimen dose melphalan . Once MTD bortezomib reach , dose administer combination melphalan condition prior PBSCT .</detailed_description>
