	<brief_summary>The Comprehensive Lung Center ( CLC ) University Pittsburgh Medical Center ( UPMC Health System ) provide patient type breathe lung disorder full range diagnostic therapeutic service . The Emphysema Research Center ( ERC ) specialty clinic , within center , attempt advance understand emphysema evaluate new therapy patient emphysema . The Emphysema Research Registry enable pulmonary research physician : 1 ) gather information create research registry people diagnose emphysema ; 2 ) utilize research registry purpose conduct research attempt advance understand emphysema evaluate new therapy ; , 3 ) use research registry identify potential candidate future research program . These aim achieve collection DNA ( genetic material ) analysis storage addition pulmonary function test medical information .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Emphysema Research Center enroll 3000 subject University Pittsburgh . The experimental procedure conduct part Emphysema Research Registry include gather basic personal information ( e.g. , name , address , phone number , etc . ) , ask basic screen question ( may involve examination past , current , future medical record authorize release collection personally identifiable medical record information ) , complete two breathing questionnaire , perform screen lung function test determine breathe capacity blood oxygen level , blood drawn , complete measurement leg muscle strength , measurement body fat . The breathing questionnaires known St. George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) Medical Research Council Dyspnea Questionnaire ( MRCDQ ) . These paper pencil questionnaires inquire respiratory symptom , quality life , shortness breath . Breathing test routine clinical test measure lung function ; spirometry ( measure ability move air lung ) , lung volume ( measure amount air trap lung ) , diffuse capacity ( measure well lung transfer oxygen blood ) , force oscillometry testing ( measure respiratory resistance ) , pulse oximetry ( measure blood oxygen level ) . In addition , subject ask inhale two puff albuterol , inhaled medicine ( bronchodilator ) may open breathe passage , repeat breathing test . The initial blood work consist two sample . The first sample examine routine test blood chemistry ( sodium potassium ) , hemoglobin , blood count , blood sugar . The second sample involve DNA test . The DNA cell determine genetic makeup . The DNA study do Research Registry restrict study genetics associate COPD . The total amount blood drawn 5 tablespoon less . A separate consent form , Consent 2 , address second blood draw detail . In addition initial blood draw , participant ask contact center experience COPD exacerbation ( increased cough , change sputum , shortness breath , etc. ) . At time , participant ask either come clinic allow study coordinator go obtain additional sample blood . The total amount sample le 2 tablespoon . Biologic sample ( serum plasma ) control principal investigator research project . To protect confidentiality , personal identifier ( i.e . name , social security number , birth date ) remove ( de-identified ) replace specific code number . The information link code number correspond subject ' identity keep separate , secure location . The investigator study keep sample indefinitely . Biological sample may ( ) give investigator outside UPMC may utilize future study . Leg muscle strength measure use isokinetic dynamometer ( MERAC , Universal , Cedar Rapids , IA ) subject . Strength measure peak angular force ( Newton-m ) generate angular velocity 60ยบ/sec three maximal continuous repetition . Subjects provide standardized instruction perform practice maneuver ensure smooth torque curve . Body fat testing , also know Fat Free Mass ( FFM ) testing , measure use single frequency bioelectrical impedance method supine position , mean two measurement ( one side body ) , use equipment previously use Emphysema Research Center ( BIA 101/s RJL-Systems , Detroit , MI ) . The FFM index calculate divide FFM height meters2 accurate measure muscle mass . All study procedure include Informed Consent , breathe questionnaire , breathe test , blood work , leg muscle strength testing , body fat test conduct Emphysema Research Center , locate Suite 1211 , Kaufmann Building . The informed consent usually take 30 minute , Patient Data Form require 5 minute fill , two breathing questionnaire take 15 minute , screen lung function test usually take less 1 hour , blood work take 15 minute , leg muscle strength test take 10 minute , body fat test take 5 minute . The information subject enter Emphysema Research Registry . The information hold research protocol develop outside investigator approach Dr. Frank C. Sciurba . The information gather ( basic personal information , basic screening question , breathe questionnaire , screen lung function test , blood work , leg muscle strength , body fat ) update periodically , base investigator need .</detailed_description>
