The patient must least mild moderate symptom ADHD . In trial 42603ATT3002 efficacy safety three fix dosage study drug OROS methlyphenidate ( MPH ) compare placebo adult subject ADHD double-blind phase . This double-blind phase follow open-label phase , design assess safety tolerabiltiy study drug OROS methylphenidate subject , get dose , optimal control symptom . In trial 42603ATT3004 patient enrol complete open-label phase trial 42603ATT3002 . Trial 42603ATT3004 design assess long-term safety tolerabilty OROS methylphenidate period 52 week dose , optimal control symptom . Patients may enter extension study 42603ATT3004 Visit 8 ( End-of-Phase Visit , Open Label ) 42603ATT3002 study long patient give informed consent prior visit perform . Visit 8 data may serve baseline data extension study . These patient continue treatment optimal dosage PR OROS methylphenidate attain open label phase protocol 42603ATT3002 . Patients complete 42603ATT3002 study , include post-study visit , may enter extension study 30 calendar day last dosing open label trial medication 42603ATT3002 study .
