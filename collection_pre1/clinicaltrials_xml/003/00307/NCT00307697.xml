	<brief_title>A Letter Intervention Primary Care Patients Improve Depression Anxiety Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2004 , UK National Health Service mandate practice send patient copy correspondence clinician involve care . Such policy consistent principle autonomy right patient access information ( Somerville , 1994 ) . It also supportive collaborative model service delivery patient view active agent wellbeing , oppose passive recipient treatment . Letter intervention boost attendance rate cervical screening ( McDowell , Newell &amp; Rosser , 1989a ) , blood pressure check ( McDowell , Newell &amp; Rosser , 1989b ) , mammography follow-up ( Saywell et al. , 2003 ) . They also result improved adherence antihypertensive medication lipid lower agent ( Atthobari , Monster &amp; de Jong-van den Berg , 2004 ) . However , caution urge relation use letter patient subpopulation , person lack capacity consent patient psychiatric diagnosis ( Jelley , van Zwanenberg &amp; Walker , 2002 ) . Despite caution , psychiatric patient react positively idea receive copy letter contain clinical information routinely send GP . At least three quarter patient never receive letter wish ( Dale , Tadros , Adams &amp; Deshpande , 2004 ; Marzanski , Musunuri &amp; Coupe , 2005 ) , least 80 % patient receive letter support practice ( Asch , Price &amp; Hawks , 1991 ; Nandhra , Murray , Hymas &amp; Hunt , 2004 ) . Most psychiatric patient wish continue receive letter , number comment `` see problem understood describe objectively help gain perspective '' ( Nandhra et al. , 2004 , p. 41 ) . Some psychiatric patient practitioner , even favour letter intervention principle , express reservation . One commonly express concern preservation patient confidentiality , especially regard psychiatric report contain highly personal information ( see , example , Marzanski et al. , 2005 ; Nandhra et al. , 2004 ) . To date , however , report breach confidentiality Britain . In fact , patient happy letter mail , carers patient dementia ( Harris &amp; Boaden , 2003 ) . Some patient practitioner also concern content letter may cause distress ( Marzanski et al. , 2005 ; Nandhra et al. , 2004 ) . However , reaction report psychiatric patient read letter experience distress . A minority patient initially feel distress , report regained composure find letter helpful glad receive ( Nandhra et al. ) . An issue yet clarify whether receipt letter improve adherence treatment recommendation case psychiatric illness . This critical issue ; recent review adherence antidepressant medication find drop rate high 33 % ( Pampallona &amp; Bollini , 2002 ) . The major aim current study establish whether adherence treatment boost letter intervention . If effect find , follow increase adherence lead improve reduction severity symptom , consequently improve patient outcome . Hypotheses : ( 1 ) receive assessment report improve patient adherence treatment recommendation ; ( 2 ) receive assessment report improve patient outcome . Method : Participants : 200 patient age 18 year refer Primary Mental Health Team assessment receive primary diagnosis depressive anxiety disorder participate . Design : A Group ( control v. experimental ) x Time ( baseline x 1 month x 3 month ) x Condition ( depressive disorder v. anxiety disorder ) measure ( ) patient adherence treatment recommendation ( b ) severity symptom . In addition , qualitative analysis reason suboptimal adherence treatment recommendation perform . Procedure : Consent seek General Practitioners refer patient PMHEIT psychiatric assessment ( see Appendix A ) . The patient consent GPs form participant pool . It current practice referral , patient give brochure explain function PMHEIT assessment procedure . This brochure contain section alert patient fact may ask participate research ( see Appendix B ) . After clinical interview , patient give participant consent form contain information research ( see Appendix C ) . If consent obtain , patient complete Depression Anxiety Stress Scales ( DASS ) SF12 questionnaire ( measure disability ) . Those whose primary diagnosis anxiety depressive disorder select inclusion trial . Participants randomly assign control experimental group . For patient assigned experimental group , assessment report simultaneously send GP register mail patient . Reports mail refer GPs control group participant , mail patient . These patient mail thank-you letter remind next follow call ( see Appendix D ) . Three week assessment interview , participant mail copy DASS reminder letter . One week later , researcher attach Primary Mental Health Team contact participant phone . She ask participant his/her response DASS item ask short series question regard adherence treatment recommendation . Where adherence partial absent , interviewer ask reason ( see Appendix E ) . This procedure repeat three month initial interview , SF12 also administer . On completion research , participant GPs mail summary research finding . Inclusion/exclusion criterion : Criteria inclusion consist DSM IV anxiety disorder depressive disorder . Exclusion criterion include primary substance abuse disorder ( though co-morbid substance abuse exclusion criterion ) , significant personality disorder , psychosis , high suicidal risk risk harm others , inability speak read English standard allow independent completion questionnaire . Clinician discretion also use exclude participant letter would contraindicate . Assessing clinician indicate record assessment inclusion study contraindicate . Randomisation procedure : Patients allocate group base random number sequence record sealed envelope . Statistical analysis : A Group ( control v. experimental ) x Time ( Initial x 1 month x 3 month ) x Condition ( depressive disorder v. anxiety disorder ) factorial ANOVA perform . Post hoc test may include Tukey and/or Scheffe analysis . Qualitative analysis response adherence question undertake use thematic analysis . References Asch , R. , Price , J. , &amp; Hawks , G.
