	<brief_title>Trivalent Baculovirus-expressed Influenza HA Vaccine Adults With Non-Hodgkin 's B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza common respiratory infection cause virus . Epidemics influenza occur winter responsible 20,000 deaths year United States . Most deaths occur among elderly person among people age suffer chronic disease . Standard influenza vaccine may effective protect cancer patient general population get influenza . This research study test experimental influenza vaccine consist important flu virus protein stimulates protection . It produce genetic technique culture cell allow high dos protein use . Influenza vaccine make way give human past vaccine well tolerate . It expect high dos vaccine give minimal reaction , well whether vaccine stimulate high level infection-fighting protein ( antibody ) blood standard dos license influenza vaccine . This study evaluate reactogenicity immunogenicity recombiant influenza vaccine non-Hodgkin 's B cell lymphoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients nonHodgkin 's Bcell lymphoma ( NHL ) include follicular , large cell Mantle cell lymphoma include . Patients complete clinical remission determine evidence active disease ( NED ) . Ambulatory , medically stable person ; community dwelling ; able give inform consent available study visit ; able understand comply plan study procedure ; ECOG performance status less equal 2 . Medically stable subject may underlie illness hypertension , diabetes , ischemic heart disease , hypothyroidism , symptoms/signs control medical therapy . Patients nonmetastatic secondary solid tumor malignancy currently ( &lt; 3 month ) treat include . Patients great equal 18 year age give informed consent sign IRB approve informed consent . Patients Hodgkin 's disease , Tcell lymphoma . Patients undergoing antineoplastic therapy . Patients receive chemotherapy within past 3 month . Individuals give rituximab ( ibritumomab tiuxetan ) &lt; 6 month . Patients receive systemic corticosteroid and/or highdose inhaled steroid ( &gt; 800 mcg per day beclomethasone dipropionate equivalent ) . Splenectomized individual include . Known allergy egg component vaccine ( e.g. , thimerosal ) . Acute chronic condition ( opinion investigator ) would render vaccination unsafe would interfere evaluation response ( include limit following : acute febrile illness , know chronic liver disease ; significant renal disease ; oxygendependent chronic lung disease , New York Heart Association Functional Class III IV dyspnea ; unstable progressive neurologic disorder ; insulindependent diabetes mellitus ) . Concomitant use investigational vaccine and/or medication within 4 week prior study entry , expect use experimental license vaccine blood/blood product prior study completion . Previous exposure parenteral immunoglobulin blood product within 6 month prior enrollment study . Subject enrol conflict clinical trial . Use experimental vaccine medication within one month study entry . Any acute chronic condition opinion investigator would render vaccination unsafe interfere evaluation response . Patients known history risk factor ( IV drug abuse casual sex within past year ) Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C , Human Immunodeficeincy Virus .</criteria>
