	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) topotecan give weekly cisplatin patient persistent , recurrent , advanced stage cervical cancer . Secondary purpose describe toxicity profile patient persistent , recurrent , advanced stage cervical cancer treat combination topotecan give weekly cisplatin determine response rate time progression patient persistent , recurrent , advanced stage cervical cancer treat combination topotecan give weekly cisplatin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Weekly Topotecan With Cisplatin Advanced Stage Recurrent Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diagnose recurrent cervical cancer generally limit option cure . Occasionally , radiation therapy may utilize localized recurrent disease curative intent ; however , patient candidate curative therapy secondary disseminate disease , thus frequently treat palliative chemotherapy . Initial experience chemotherapy clinical setting demonstrate cisplatin active agent . Subsequent trial use combination cisplatin ifosfamide paclitaxel demonstrate high response rate compare cisplatin alone demonstrate improvement overall survival . Topotecan topoisomerase I inhibitor used management cervical ovarian cancer . Several phase II study demonstrate topotecan active agent cervical cancer . In effort ameliorate toxicity note 3-5 day dose regimen topotecan , investigator evaluate weekly dosing topotecan . Thus far , toxicity weekly topotecan dose cervical cancer evaluate . In study , topotecan give weekly escalate dose level start 2.0 mb/m2 standard cisplatin 50 mg/m2 every 21 day . This study help determine acceptable dose combination weekly topotecan cisplatin patient persistent , recurrent , advanced stage cervical cancer utilized cohort patient cervical cancer phase II study .</detailed_description>
