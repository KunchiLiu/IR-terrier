	<brief_title>Clinical Predictors Survival Cancer Patients With Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients incurable cancer frequently ask doctor estimate survival . Such estimate assist patient make decision best spend time energy . Survival estimate also require consider patient incurable cancer experimental treatment . However , estimate difficult make . There data suggest simple clinical measure , performance status , combine laboratory blood test , LDH , may assist make survival estimate realistic . This study design test case , use patient metastatic lung , breast , colorectal , prostate , pancreatic cancer patient cancer unknown primary exhaust life-prolonging therapy . These patient ask consent enter study . Their performance status assess Karnofsky WHO scale , ask blood test LDH doctor ask estimate survival . After study entry allow receive palliative radiotherapy , surgery systemic therapy indicate include protocol treatment . After study entry , requirement date patient death report duration survival compare doctor patient estimate correlate performance status LDH .</detailed_description>
