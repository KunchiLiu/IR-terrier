Weekly phone call encourage second group make minimize attrition . The first group follow via phone interview , follow-up data collect conclusion study . Subjects men woman establish diagnosis OA meeting ACR criterion , 35 year age great , score 4-9 visual analogue scale . Subjects exclude base gender race .</detailed_description>
