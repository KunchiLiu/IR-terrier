	<brief_title>Evaluation Whether Functional Strength Training Can Enhance Recovery Mobility After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular weakness occur frequently stroke process underlying recovery still poorly understood . Accepted practice UK physiotherapy avoid training muscle strength stroke preliminary evidence might effective . An observer-blind randomised clinical trial . Subjects within 3 month first stroke voluntary movement paretic low limb . A power calculation estimate sample size 300 . Research Physiotherapists , blind measurement , recruit subject , allocate subject one three intervention group use sequentially number sealed envelope contain previously randomise allocate intervention card provide intervention . The Research Assessors , blind intervention allocation undertake measurement . Conventional therapy ( control ) provide normal clinical setting , additional conventional therapy ( experimental 1 ) functional strength training ( experimental 2 ) provide one hour , four time week , six week . Subjects two experimental group also receive conventional therapy standard clinical setting . Blinded measurement make randomisation , end intervention 12-weeks thereafter . Primary outcome maximum torque around knee joint , gait velocity . The secondary outcome include movement analysis , functional ability , corticospinal transmission ( transcranial magnetic stimulation ) health relate quality life ( Euroqol ) . The primary analysis analysis covariance . A multiple comparison procedure ( Gabriel 's test ) use compare pair treatment . Euroqol data use estimate relative cost intervention calculate incremental cost per QUALY gain . Every effort make invite patient assessment outcome follow-up even withdraw therapy allow intention-to-treat principle apply .</detailed_description>
