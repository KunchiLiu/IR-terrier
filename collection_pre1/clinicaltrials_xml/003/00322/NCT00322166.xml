	<brief_summary>The propose study determine effect public health strategy ( ie . increase sun light exposure increase calcium intake ) reduce fall old people residential care use randomise trial . The primary hypothesis trial increase appropriate sun light exposure reduce fall , improve 25 hydroxy vitamin D ( 25OHD ) level low parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) level . Secondary hypothesis intervention reduce accelerate bone turnover , reduce fracture , improve motor function improve mood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Objectives The propose trial determine effect public health strategy ( ie increase sun light exposure increase calcium intake ) reduce fall fracture old people live residential care randomise trial . The primary hypothesis trial increase appropriate sun light exposure reduce fall , improve 25OHD level low PTH level . Secondary hypothesis intervention reduce accelerate bone turnover , reduce fracture , improve motor function improve mood . Study Design A randomise , control , multi-centre trial conduct 12 month . Cluster randomization perform hostel ( low care residential age care facility ) agree participate . Participants Participants recruit primarily residential age care facility Northern Sydney participate FREE study ( currently 32 hostel ) . Men woman invite participate study . Written inform consent participant proxy obtain . The following general inclusion criterion apply subject invite participate : - Aged 70 year - Ambulant - Likely survive 12 month , assess Implicit Review Tool employ FREE study - Not take vitamin D calcium supplement - No history skin cancer last three year Interventions Subjects intervention group ask undergo exposure approximately 15 % body ( ie face , hand arm ) usually 9.30am - 10am daily year , 5 day per week . During mid summer , session run 8.30am - 9am . It recognise may practically difficult achieve exposure month June - August exposure winter month may less effective , consider important study run continuously year adherence purpose . Adherence enhance via appointment 'Sunlight Assistants ' intervention institution , normally employ institution duty reimburse 1.5 hour per day duty study . During winter , late autumn early spring inclement weather , time lose make afternoon exposure subsequent day . In calcium sunlight arm , calcium supplement ( Caltrate , 600mg elemental calcium , Whitehall ) administer whole group end sunlight exposure session . The Sunlight Assistants record compliance tablet . Subjects control group provide fact sheet vitamin D deficiency treat . They receive usual routine care nutrition . All participant receive medical care usually provide health professional . Outcomes Baseline data collect study research staff , implement intervention hostel initially , conjunction Sunlight Assistants . Baseline measure include demographic detail , medication use , history fall fracture . Skin phenotype grade semi-quantitatively baseline . UV tag use measure actual exposure hostel sunlight group examine dose -response relationship . The primary outcome fall assess last cluster recruit reach 12 month follow-up . Serum 25OHD PTH measure every 6 month allow time trend dose response analysis . Falls record regular monthly visit hostel include review incident report clinical record review , FREE study . Serum 25OHD measure use specific radio-immunoassay 100 % cross-reactivity 25OHD2 25OHD3 ( DiaSorin Inc , USA ) . This assay sensitivity 4nmol/L intra-assay precision 7.6 % inter-assay precision 9.0 % employ FREE study . Serum level intact PTH also determine baseline FREE study two-site chemiluminescent enzyme-linked immunometric assay DPC Immulite 1000 analyser . This assay procedure measure intact PTH molecule . The sensitivity assay 1pg/ml cross reactivity PTH fragment related compound low . The assay typical intra-assay precision 5.5 % inter-assay precision 7.9 % . Biochemistry relevant calcium metabolism include serum calcium , phosphate , albumin creatinine also measure baseline standard autoanalyser methodology . Bone turnover measure use intact serum aminoterminal propeptide type I procollagen ( PINP ) marker bone formation serum carboxyterminal telopeptide type I collagen ( CTX ) marker bone resorption , employ FREE . PINP determine use automate immunoassay ( Elecsys 170 , __ Roche Diagnostics ) . This assay sensitivity approximately 5 ng /mL intra-assay precision approximately 2.3 % . CTX determine use automate immunoassay ( Elecsys 170_ Roche Diagnostics ) intra-assay precision approximately 2.0 % . These turnover marker measure baseline 12 month . Other secondary outcome include motor function measure relate fall risk ( static balance , sit stand test ) assess baseline 12 month use methodology employ FREE study . Quadriceps strength body sway also assess sub-sample . Fractures determine regular visit ( monthly ) hostel validate x-ray report FREE study . The effect intervention mood assess use Geriatric Depression Scale .</detailed_description>
