	<brief_summary>This study determine safely well people tolerate AMD3100 large normal dos mobilize CD34+ cell , ( stem cell ) . AMD3100 new drug design mobilize stem cell transplantation cancer patient . It push cell circulation , make easy collect , temporarily increase number stem cell person 's blood . Patients age 18 50 good health pregnant breastfeeding may eligible study . They undergo follow test procedure : - History physical examination - Review medication , include prescribe over-the-counter , well nutritional supplement - Blood test liver , kidney , function ; infection include hepatitis AIDS - Pregnancy test - Electrocardiogram On day receive AMD3100 , patient admit Clinical Center . They receive two dos , injected skin , interval separate 14 90 day . Dose level 240 320 micrograms/kg 400 480 micrograms/kg . For 24 hour follow first AMD3100 administration , blood collect periodically plastic tube amount dependent dos AMD3100 give . If patient receive one two high dos , heart rhythm monitor continuously hospital stay . From 7 10 day follow administration AMD3100 , patient give blood sample monitor effect . The second dose AMD3100 give 14 90 day first one . Patients return Clinical Center procedures do previously , dose drug high . Risks involve side effect AMD3100 . In previous study , patient receive drug experience temporary increase white blood cell count . Serious side effect include abnormally low platelet clot , abnormal heart rhythm , low blood pressure . Patients carefully monitor effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peripheral blood progenitor cell ( PBPC ) become preferred source hematopoietic stem cell allogeneic transplantation technical ease collection short time require engraftment . Traditionally , granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) use procure PBPC graft . Although regimen use G-CSF usually succeed collect adequate number PBPC healthy donor , 5 % -10 % subject mobilize progenitor cell poorly may require multiple large volume apheresis bone marrow harvest . AMD3100 bicyclam compound inhibit bind stromal cell derive factor-1 ( SDF-1 ) cognate receptor CXCR4 . CXCR4 present CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cell interaction SDF-1 play pivotal role home CD34+ cell bone marrow . Inhibition CXCR4-SDF-1 axis AMD3100 release CD34+ cell circulation , collect easily apheresis . Recently , several report demonstrate large number progenitor CD34+ cell rapidly mobilize healthy volunteer follow single subcutaneous injection AMD3100 . The ability collect large quantity PBPC 's single injection drug make attractive agent mobilize autologous allogeneic donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . A phase one dose escalate trial AMD3100 healthy donor do outside NHLBI suggest peak CD34+ mobilizing effect agent occur 240 microgram/kg dose . Of note , dose limit toxicity observe high dose level 320 mcg/kg . In two current trial NHLBI , AMD3100 also proven well tolerated 240 mcg/kg dose , however , progenitor CD34+ cell yield follow matched volume apheresis low compare G-CSF mobilization collect healthy volunteer . More importantly , number CD34+ cell collect follow one dose AMD3100 frequently less 3 x 10 ( 6 ) CD34+ cells/kg , previously define minimal dose progenitor cell require optimize allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation outcome . In addition , preliminary data non-human primate study suggest high dos AMD3100 may improve CD34+ cell yield apheresis collection . Based data , possible inter-subject variability CD34+ cell mobilization may lead investigator ( prior phase I study ) prematurely terminate AMD3100 dose escalation base perception CD34+ dose peak . We therefore propose dose escalate study , design evaluate safety activity AMD3100 administer escalate high dos ( 240 microgram/kg dose , 320 microgram/kg dose 400 microgram/kg dose 480 microgram/kg dose ) . Activity evaluate measure effective dose AMD3100 mobilizing progenitor CD34 + cell circulation healthy donor . To minimize inter-subject variability , administer two different dos AMD3100 subject , evaluate peak CD34+ cell count achieve dose . Separate cohort healthy volunteer evaluate dose escalation . The short half life rapid wash-out AMD3100 allow method study .</detailed_description>
