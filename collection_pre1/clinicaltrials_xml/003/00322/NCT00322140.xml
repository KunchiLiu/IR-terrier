They must chemotherapy biologic therapy within 4 week prior enter study ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C , 8 week UCN01 ) . Patients must least 1 month since prior radiation major surgery . Patients must great equal 2 week since prior participation Phase Zero study . Patients bisphosphonates cancer androgen deprivation therapy prostate cancer , however , need discontinue therapy order eligible . Age great equal 18 year . ECOG performance status less equal 2 ( Karnofsky great equal 60 % , see Appendix A ) . Life expectancy great 3 month . Patients must normal adequate organ marrow function define : Hb great equal 10 g/dL absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/ L platelet great equal 100,000/ L total bilirubin less equal 1.5 normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal creatinine clearance le 1 x upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level institutional normal . The effect CDDO develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation 2 month discontinuation study . Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test order eligible . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately .
