	<brief_summary>The main target population tetravalent live attenuate dengue virus vaccine indigenous population , especially infants less 2 year old , reside area world endemic dengue risk develop dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) . The presence maternal dengue antibody first year life make unlikely vaccine give time long-term efficacy , vaccine virus would likely neutralized prior necessary replication . Children old 18 month may preexist flavivirus antibody . Therefore , vaccination infant live Thailand early second year life ( age 12 18 month ) seem beneficial . The aim trial evaluate safety immunogenicity two-dose schedule tetravalent live attenuate dengue vaccine flavivirus antibody naïve infant begin 12-15 month age . - To assess kinetics dengue neutralize antibody dengue virus serotype one four year follow dose 2 dengue/control vaccination set potential wild-type dengue virus exposure . - To assess immunogenicity , safety reactogenicity booster dose dengue vaccine administer Year 3 follow primary vaccination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Trial Tetravalent Live Attenuated Dengue Vaccine Flavivirus Antibody Naive Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- This Phase I/II , randomize , observer-blind , controlled trial . Thirty-four flavivirus naïve infant randomize vaccine group 17 infant control group . - Infants receive dengue vaccine study month 0 6 control vaccine ( Varicella vaccine study month 0 Haemophilus influenzae Type b Conjugate vaccine study month 6 ) . Both license use Thailand . - All infant subsequently receive inactivated JE vaccine approximately one 1.5 month follow dengue vaccine dose 2 . - Infants monitor daily 21 day follow dengue control vaccination 7 day JE vaccination solicit adverse event . Unsolicited event record 31 day ( day 0-30 ) dengue/control vaccination day dose 1 JE vaccine conclude study visit . - Study duration ( exclude screen ) approximately 8.5 month subject . - Each enrollee follow four year period follow dose 2 dengue/control vaccination ass dengue-related hospitalization dengue antibody kinetics . - Investigators administer 3rd dose tetravalent dengue vaccine subject receive 2 dos dengue vaccine ( 0 6 month ) primary phase study . The 3rd dose administer 3 year follow primary vaccination series . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) serum collect time dose 3 , twice one month one year follow dose 3 dengue group subject . Investigators address follow question : 1 . Is 3rd dose live virus tetravalent dengue vaccine safe Thai toddlers/children ? 2 . Is 3rd dose live virus tetravalent dengue vaccine require toddlers/children induce optimal immune ( neutralize antibody , cellular mediate immunity ) responses ? 3 . Is evidence T B cell memory follow primary dengue vaccination series ( dose 1 2 ) ? 4 . How 3rd dose live virus tetravalent dengue vaccine impact B T cell memory ?</detailed_description>
