	<brief_summary>This study attempt find effect mosquito insecticide transmission malaria The Gambia . Eight hundred healthy men woman , age 18 40 year , live select village east Farafenni town The Gambia , West Africa screen parasite . About 552 people expect free malaria form study group . These people participate study 7 month check malaria-causing parasite every two week finger prick blood sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malaria remain one world 's great childhood killer substantial obstacle social economic development tropic . The overwhelming bulk world 's malaria burden rest upon population sub-Saharan Africa unique coincidence expand human population , weak health system , world 's effective vector mosquito specie environmental condition ideal transmission . At start new millennium malaria still deeply entrenched Africa effective malaria control threat inexorable spread parasite strain resistant antimalarial drug emergence mosquito resistant pyrethroid insecticide use impregnate bednets . Larval control may offer new alternative effective control . Mosquito larval control strategy ( environmental management larviciding ) historically show successful reduce abundance mosquito . This study plan apply larvicide effort control malaria reduce burden malaria . While abundantly clear product kill mosquito larvae laboratory field , certain reduce burden malaria human population . Briefly , step involve include survival development immature mosquito stage , emergence adult mosquito , blood feeding mosquito , acquisition development malaria parasite adult mosquito transmission parasites susceptible human . The objective pilot study evaluate use time-to-infection end point measure malaria transmission The Gambia , mosquito larvicide use control malaria vector . The main outcome study ( 1 ) proportion adult detectable parasitemia ( Plasmodium falciparum ) binary variable ( 2 ) time-to-infection malaria parasite treat continuous variable . This experimental design take place 7 month . The target sample size 800 adult ( age 18-40 year , approximately half woman half men ) live 50 village east Farafenni town The Gambia , West Africa . It estimate 552 adult detectable parasite blood begin transmission season ( June ) . These parasite negative individual follow either duration transmission season ( June November ) become positive parasite .</detailed_description>
