	<brief_summary>Many people diabetes desire share blood glucose data member team . Using unique wireless glucose meter device , real-time wireless alert may automatically send specific team interested caregiver patient selects . Additionally , trend report automatically deliver number authorize patient caregiver facilitate frequent review glycemic control . This study recruit patient throughout USA include Hawaii Alaska .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diabetes Technology Study Real-Time Glucose Alerts Team Management Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous research suggest use wireless message handle value finger-stick blood glucose test make number available patient diabetes health care team may improve management diabetes . We would like test GlucoMON glucose meter accessory device real-time wireless alert feature automatically send specific team interested caregiver patient selects effect real-time alert management diabetes . We also would like know whether procedure improve frequency glucose pattern management patient possibly reduce cost care require frequent interaction patient diabetes care team . In study , compare new wireless device Internet-based automate data management system exist method share data amongst interested care team . Specifically , research answer question , `` How real-time alert feature GlucoMON device compare people regularly initiate telephone call ( notification ) interest member care team report ) blood glucose test perform ; b ) numerical value blood glucose level ; , c ) time blood glucose test perform ? '' In addition , data collect study use answer large question whether automated share patient direct blood sugar information affect diabetes control positively negatively degree . The GlucoMON device provide Diabetech , LP automate , wireless blood glucose collection reporting system use send encrypt glucose data secure Internet connection review patient authorize diabetes care team . Preparing deliver glucose data manner help care team know person diabetes test provide level information regard current blood glucose control even though patient . The obvious use feature automate diabetes management system delivery blood sugar text message mother and/or father child type 1 diabetes attempt provide remote assistance son daughter school . However , one scenario researcher anticipate patient feedback .</detailed_description>
