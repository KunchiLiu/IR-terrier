	<brief_summary>This study look safety , effectiveness , tolerability combination medication initial treatment non-gonococcal urethritis ( NGU ) . NGU inflammation tube carry urine bladder . NGU cause bacteria may pass person person sex . This study compare 2 currently recommend NGU treatment , doxycycline azithromycin , take tinidazole ( another medication treat certain sexually transmitted infection ) . Tinidazole use doxycycline azithromycin may cure NGU good doxycycline azithromycin use alone . Study participants 300 men age 16-45 year NGU attend sexually transmit disease clinic Birmingham , AL ; New Orleans , LA ; Durham , NC ; Baltimore , MD . Study participation last 7 week involve 3 visit . At visit , participant provide urine sample , 2 urethral swab , urethra check discharge indicate infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NGU : Doxycycline ( Plus Minus Tinidazole ) Versus Azithromycin ( Plus Minus Tinidazole )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study represent clinical evaluation use combination therapy initial treatment non-gonococcal urethritis ( NGU ) . This study provide current data comparison cure rate 2 currently recommend therapy NGU , doxycycline azithromycin . Emerging clinical data suggest latter may become efficacious NGU effective eradicate Mycoplasma ( M. ) genitalium genital tract former . Only vitro data , limited , suggest doxycycline active M. genitalium . The researcher hypothesize cure rate NGU significantly improve doxycycline azithromycin use combination therapy tinidazole . Important safety tolerability data collect regard use combination therapy . Additionally , study provide data prevalence target pathogen 4 geographic area characteristic men NGU may help target population would benefit combination therapy . The researcher hypothesize currently recommend initial therapy NGU inadequate least certain population due lack coverage Trichomonas ( T. ) vaginalis . The researcher hypothesize 2 currently recommend regimen , azithromycin result great number cure doxycycline due great efficacy M. genitalium infect men . The primary study objective : compare clinical cure rate doxycycline versus doxycycline tinidazole ; azithromycin versus azithromycin tinidazole treatment NGU ; evaluate safety tolerability doxycycline/tinidazole azithromycin/tinidazole treatment NGU . Secondary study objective : evaluate microbiological cure Chlamydia ( C. ) trachomatis , T. vaginalis , M. genitalium men treat doxycycline versus doxycycline tinidazole ; azithromycin versus azithromycin tinidazole . Analysis also include : ( doxycycline plus doxycycline/tinidazole ) versus ( azithromycin plus azithromycin/tinidazole ) ; clinical cure rate , analysis also include : ( doxycycline plus doxycycline/tinidazole ) versus ( azithromycin plus azithromycin/tinidazole ) ; determine prevalence C. trachomatis , T. vaginalis , M. genitalium study population men non-gonococcal urethritis ; determine clinical , behavioral , demographic predictor organisms men non-gonococcal urethritis ; collect specimens future study determine role unique novel pathogen etiology non-gonococcal urethritis . Outcome measure include clinical failure , clinical cure , microbiological cure , unevaluable cure assess first second follow-up visit . Study participant include 300 men age 16-45 year NGU attend sexually transmit disease clinic Birmingham , AL ; New Orleans , LA ; Durham , NC ; Baltimore , MD . Subjects randomly assign 1 4 active treatment arm : 75 subject doxycycline ; 75 subject doxycycline plus tinidazole ; 75 subject azithromycin ; 75 subject azithromycin plus tinidazole .</detailed_description>
