	<brief_title>Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) Induced Hypertension Correlation With Tumor Response , Chart Review</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study retrospective chart review patient metastatic cancer type treat bevacizumab ( without chemotherapy ) University New Mexico Cancer Research &amp; Treatment Center within last year investigate correlation bevacizumab induce hypertension response rate . We look wide variety tumor type plan subset analysis evaluate correlation within individual tumor type . As mention , Grades bevacizumab induce hypertension typically report accord NCI common terminology criterion adverse event include study addition also evaluate incremental change systolic ( SBP ) , diastolic ( DBP ) , mean arterial blood ( MAP ) pressure mmHg . Looking three variable allow u see one component ( SBP DBP ) combination ( MAP ) may allow u predict response . Response measure appropriate radiographic imagine ( CT scan x-ray ) and/or appropriate tumor marker . In addition , VEGF appear play role hypertension , would like look pre-existing hypertension predictor response and/or bevacizumab induced hypertension .</detailed_description>
