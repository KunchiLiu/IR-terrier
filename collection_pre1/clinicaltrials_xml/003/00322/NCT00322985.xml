	<brief_summary>T-cell Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma group cancer usually treat chemotherapy , radiation therapy , occasionally surgery . T-cell lymphoma relatively uncommon therefore well study . Treatment approach pattern common B-cell lymphoma . T-cell lymphoma likely relapse follow standard therapy B-cell lymphoma . New therapy need T-cell lymphoma . In study , administer drug call lenalidomide pill patient T-cell lymphoma . The goal determine drug induce regression cancer , determine treatment well tolerated patient group . This study take place six cancer centre across Canada .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Clinical Trial Lenalidomide T-cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : T-cell lymphoma comprise 10-15 % non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas include variety histological subtypes . These disease variable clinical behaviour , response therapy , long-term outcome . In general , T-cell lymphomas characterize inferior response therapy prognosis compare common B-cell lymphoma . Because T-cell lymphoma uncommon , generally well studied current treatment approach borrow establish protocol B-cell lymphoma . New therapy need T-cell lymphoma , study separately effectiveness T-cell lymphoma . Lenalidomide ( CC-5013 , Revlimid ; Celgene Corporation ) oral thalidomide analogue anti-cancer activity . Lenalidomide generally well tolerate , rash , myelosuppression venous thrombosis notable common potential side effect . Lenalidomide demonstrate impressive anti-cancer activity mycosis fungoides ( cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ) , multiple myeloma , chronic lymphocytic leukemia myelodysplasia . The drug currently review Health Canada potential new standard therapy multiple myeloma . We encourage efficacy tolerability lenalidomide patient related disease , study role treatment T-cell lymphoma mycosis fungoides . Primary Objective : To determine overall response rate single agent lenalidomide standard dos ( 25 mg po daily 21 day 28-day cycle ) , treatment T-cell lymphoma . Secondary Objectives : To determine complete response rate , time progression , overall survival tolerability patient T-cell lymphoma treat lenalidomide . Study Design : A multi-centre , Canadian , Phase II , investigator-initiated clinical trial . Inclusion Criteria : `` Patients follow subtypes T-cell lymphoma : - Peripheral T-cell lymphoma , unspecified - Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma - Enteropathy-type T-cell lymphoma - NK/T-cell lymphoma - Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma - Subcutaneous panniculitic-like T-cell lymphoma - Anaplastic large cell lymphoma - Lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma `` Measurable disease ( See section 6.2 ) `` WHO performance status 0-2 `` Both untreated patient contraindication chemotherapy , patient relapsed/refractory disease least one line chemotherapy allow ; restriction number prior therapy `` Patients prior radiotherapy , autologous allogeneic stem cell transplant allow `` Age &gt; 18 year , able give inform consent `` Acceptable hematological biochemical parameter ( see section 6.2 ) Exclusion Criteria : `` Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome `` Pregnant lactating female `` Concurrent use anti-cancer therapy `` Other serious co-morbid illness would compromise participation study `` Prior therapy lenalidomide `` Prior hypersensitivity thalidomide It intend enroll patient relapse spite chemotherapy , radiotherapy and/or high dose therapy stem cell transplant , patient eligible standard therapy . It would encourage patient initially treated standard therapy possible . However , wish allow untreated patient participate old , frail patient disseminate T-cell lymphoma patient significant comorbidities may eligible aggressive chemotherapy may tolerate lenalidomide quite well . In regard , leave discretion investigator determine whether individual patient consider enrollment clinical trial , whether patient would well serve standard treatment approach . Recruitment take place outpatient clinic Cross Cancer Institute five Canadian cancer clinic ( Vancouver , Calgary , Winnipeg , Ottawa , Halifax ) . The Cross Cancer Institute lead site trial team responsible oversight trial , collation patient case report form , communication Health Canada Celgene , data analysis . Celgene monitor site involve trial every 3-4 month . Statistical Analysis use standard method include data safety monitoring committee ( DSMB ) perform interim safety analysis ten 22 patient enrolled trial . An interim efficacy analysis perform 22 patient enrol . The trial stop few 2 first 22 patient enrol achieve objective response therapy accord standard criterion . If two response occur , trial continue remain 18 patient accrue absence safety concern . There pre-specified criterion stop trial basis safety concern , investigator independent DSMB power halt enrollment serious safety concern arise point trial . Patients require stop study treatment severe adverse reaction occur , lymphoma progress , serious intercurrent illness interfere treatment , suspect pregnancy occurs , major study protocol violation . Sample size : For total 40 subject , 22 accrue stage 1 18 stage 2 . If 1 few response observe first stage trial stop early . Given 'true ' response probability 5 % , 70 % probability end trial stage 1 . However , 'true ' response probability 20 % 5 % probability trial stop stage 1 . The alpha level design 0.04 power 0.9 . If few 4 40 patient respond , consider evidence lenalidomide inactive population study .</detailed_description>
