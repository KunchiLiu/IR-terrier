	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical study develop easily perform test detect Group B Streptococcus ( GBS ) pregnant woman time delivery , would allow health care provider make accurate rapid decision regard administration antibiotic . Administering antibiotic delivery reduce significantly likelihood transmission GBS , bacterium cause severe life-threatening disease newborn . Three hundred twenty pregnant females 18 44 year age , admit delivery time consent , recruit Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Quebec . Participation involve observe 30 minute . The research nurse obtain 2 vaginal/anal sample use standard technique . One sample use detect GBS approve BD GeneOhm StrepB assay sample use development new point-of-care rapid detection GBS test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Group B Streptococcus ( GBS ) , also know Streptococcus agalactiae , gram-positive diplococcus originally know cause bovine mastitis demonstrate human pathogen 1938 . In 1970s , GBS emerge lead cause neonatal morbidity mortality . GBS cause severe invasive disease newborn . Approximately 80 % infection young infant occur within first week life thus designate early-onset disease . Late-onset infection usually occur infant 1 week 3 month age . Young infant invasive GBS disease usually sepsis pneumonia may , though less frequently , present meningitis , osteomyelitis , septic arthritis . Bloodstream infection , without pneumonia , main manifestation neonatal GBS disease observe approximately 90 % case , meningitis occur around 10 % . Most early-onset disease result ascend spread GBS amniotic fluid , lead neonatal colonization invasive disease infant . Perinatal transmission organism occur rupture intact membrane . Transmission mother child report 29 time higher GBS-colonized mother noncolonized mother . The new Centers Disease Control Prevention guideline recommend universal prenatal culture-based screening GBS colonization pregnant woman . A sensitive rapid-screening test GBS could accurately detect woman carry GBS time delivery would obviate need prenatal screen reduce risk associate use intrapartum prophylaxis antibotics non-colonized woman . The main objective study develop optimize micro TAS prototype rapid GBS detection directly vaginal/anal specimen use swab collect pregnant woman admit delivery . It expect diagnostic system replace current `` gold standard '' microbiological culture selective medium determine GBS colonization . Specific objective study include : ( 1 ) analytical sensitivity micro TAS prototype ( number GBS colony form unit detect per vaginal/anal specimen ) determine use prospectively collect vaginal/anal specimen positive GBS well negative vaginal/anal specimen spike various number GBS cell ; ( 2 ) specificity micro TAS prototype ( ability detect specifically GBS nucleotide sequence without detect microbial specie human sequence ) determine use GBS-negative vaginal/anal specimen ; ( 3 ) sample analysis performance micro TAS prototype compare clinical sample FDA-approved BD GeneOhm StrepB assay . Study participant include 320 pregnant female 18 44 year age , admit Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Qu√©bec delivery . Participation involve observe 30 minute . The research nurse obtain 2 vaginal/anal sample use standard technique . One sample use detect GBS approve BD GeneOhm StrepB assay sample use development new point-of-care rapid detection GBS test .</detailed_description>
