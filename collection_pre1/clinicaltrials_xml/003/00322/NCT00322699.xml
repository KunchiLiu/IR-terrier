	<brief_title>Sequential Whole Bladder Photodynamic Therapy ( WBPDT ) Management Superficial Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient Evaluation Treatment : 1 . Patients sign IRB-approved inform consent form 2 . Initial patient assessment include : - eligibility - History physical . - clinical profile - upper urinary tract imaging ( clinically indicate ) - urinary symptom assessment WBPDT Treatment : 1 . Porfimer Sodium ( Photofrin ) 1.5 mg/kg iv follow 2 day later whole bladder laser light 630 nm target light dose 1200 Joules ( +/-100Joules ) 2 . Patients undergo three sequential WBPDT treatment 3 . Treatments occur least three month apart 4 . All WBPDT treatment occur within 12 month Decisions administer second third WBPDT base upon urological medical assessment individual patient necessarily dependent upon Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLT ) early stop endpoint ( although information may take account individual patient assessment ) . Patients experience DLT may continue WBPDT investigator 's discretion reduce dos Porfimer Sodium and/or light . The following consider Dose Limiting Toxicities ( DLT ) : - Urinary symptom grade 3 , 12 week duration ( see section 7 toxicity grading ) - Loss &gt; 50 % baseline bladder volume - Clinical decision investigator patient discontinue due toxicity . Efficacy assessed basis follow criterion : - Complete Response : cystoscopy biopsy and/or cytology without evidence cancer . - Partial Response : normal cystoscopy biopsy , obtain , persistent positive suspicious cytology localize bladder ; , patient CIS , &gt; 50 % reduction extent CIS . - Persistent/Recurrent Disease : persistent recurrent cancer less stage grade enrollment without obvious increase tumor burden . - Progression : cancer great stage grade enrollment obvious increase tumor burden . Referred patient undergo post-PDT cystoscopy refer Urologists , transmit result study site Gainesville , Fl . 5 . Symptoms assess one month follow WBPDT weekly telephone contact . 6 . Urine blood cytokine obtain treatment possibly twice afterwards store -80oF analysis later . 7 . Biopsy specimen sample tumor normal bladder may obtain cystoscopy store later analysis biomarkers . 8 . Patients follow toxicity , disease status , urinary tract symptom , survival .</detailed_description>
