	<brief_summary>Parapsoriasis term refers precursor stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) /mycosis fungoides ( MF ) . Complete response ( clear ) early presentation CTCL/MF show associated long-term survival cure . Induction complete response parapsoriasis , therefore , would seem desirable therapeutic endpoint . Bexarotene 1 % gel approve treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( mycosis fungoides ) . The goal study evaluate tolerability , safety efficacy bexarotene 1 % gel patient parapsoriasis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Parapsoriasis term refers red , scale ( papulosquamous ) eruption skin characterize distribution ( trunk proximal extremity ) , asymptomatic nature chronic course . Histologically , parapsoriasis characterize variable degree parakeratosis epidermal spongiosis superficial , sparse , patchy , lichenoid infiltrate lymphocyte vary degree epidermal involvement ( epidermotropism ) . No definitive study define etiology epidemiology . Historically , term `` parapsoriasis '' introduce dermatology literature Brocq 1902 . Brocq use term clinically characterize variety papulosquamous eruption first report late 19th century . In 1905 , attempt categorize parapsoriasis relationship papulosquamous disease skin . In model , Brocq delineate relationship variant parapsoriasis ( parapsoriasis en plaque large plaque parapsoriasis ) mycosis fungoides cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . The first case mycosis fungoides ( MF ) report early 19th century . Progressive stage MF ( `` premycotic '' patch phase , plaque phase tumor phase ) define later 19th century , neoplastic nature disease remain unknown . Brocq 's model seek emphasize clinical similarity variant parapsoriasis ( large plaque ) early , patch phase MF . Immunohistochemical ( IHC ) study demonstrate parapsoriasis share similar immunophenotype early stage CTCL lymphocytic infiltrate predominantly compose CD4 lymphocyte . Polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) - base T-cell receptor ( TCR ) gene rearrangement study demonstrate parapsoriasis lymphoproliferative disorder characterize detection clonal population T-cells , CTCL . Knowledge natural history parapsoriasis stem series longitudinal outcome study publish last 40 year . Progression unequivocal CTCL range 0 % 35 % parapsoriasis case . Typically , case associate progression CTCL tend large plaque clinical feature atrophy and/or poikiloderma . Based clinicopathologic similarity parapsoriasis early stage CTCL , exact nosology parapsoriasis challenge , hypothesis variant parapsoriasis ( large plaque , small plaque digitate ) synonymous early MF . Nevertheless , parapsoriasis recognize distinct precursor stage ( T0N0M0 ) TNM stag schema CTCL . T0 CTCL define presence lesion clinically and/or histologically suggestive CTCL . No definitive study publish regard therapy parapsoriasis . When treated , patient initiate empirically topical steroid phototherapy . Typically , patient partial response and/or relapse therapy . A rational therapeutic strategy parapsoriasis lack longitudinal study correlate treatment response impact progression CTCL . Bexarotene resinoid , subclass retinoids bind preferentially nuclear retinoic X receptor ( RXR ) , therapeutic activity CTCL . Bexarotene 1 % gel approve treatment CTCL find 63 % response rate Stage Ia IIa CTCL . The goal study evaluate tolerability , safety efficacy bexarotene 1 % gel patient parapsoriasis evaluate anti-tumor host response pre- post-treatment skin biopsy .</detailed_description>
