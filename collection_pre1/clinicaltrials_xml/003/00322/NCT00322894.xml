	<brief_summary>The Expanded Breast Cancer Registry Tissue Repository Research Team ( EBCR-RT ) comprise University Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center faculty staff whose goal improve outcome quality life patient breast cancer , ultimately eradicate cure breast cancer . One focus EBCR-RT creation infrastructure potentially adopt model statewide registry tissue repository discovery biomarkers disease . The goal EBCR : 1 . To register patient diagnosed breast cancer information relevant diagnosis ( stage , grade , hormone receptor status , etc ) , treatment ( surgery , radiation , chemotherapy , hormone therapy , etc ) , survivorship ( Quallity Life , etc ) . 2 . To collect relevant demographic include age , menopausal status , race/ethnicity , body mass index ( BMI ) , place residence , behavior ( smoking , alcohol intake , etc ) 3 . To establish paired tumor tissue blood sample relevant time-point ( define protocol ) , store Tissue Bank Shared Resource Facility future hypothesis-driven research .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Institutions and/or physician require report new diagnosis breast cancer New Mexico Tumor Registry ( NMTR ) . The NMTR valuable database provide information breast cancer , include trend incidence survival . However , relevant information breast cancer prognosis treatment either routinely collect readily available NMTR . We propose establish Expanded Breast Cancer Registry Tissue Repository ( EBCR ) institution could serve infrastructure collection information . Furthermore , tissue bank establish collection pair tissue ( tumor , buccal cell blood sample ) patient diagnose breast cancer consent provide excess/extra tissue additional blood Tissue Repository . This tissue bank serve repository researcher access tissue sample conduct laboratory-based study genetic determinant breast cancer risk , prognosis survival woman breast cancer see institution .</detailed_description>
