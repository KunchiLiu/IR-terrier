	<brief_summary>This study treat patient diffuse large B-cell lymphoma whose disease complete remission due previous treatment CHOP-R. Half patient receive Zevalin half receive anti-cancer treatment . The two patient group compare determine Zevalin give CHOP-R therapy provide great benefit receive additional anti-cancer therapy CHOP R .</brief_summary>
