	<brief_summary>This research study do look safety medication Mirtazapine ( Remeron ) people cocaine dependence depression . Hypotheses I . Cocaine usage less mirtazapine treatment group ( MG ) control group ( CG ) . II . A great increase Clinician Global Impression ( CGI ) score observe MG CG . Secondary Hypotheses : I . A great decrease Hamilton Rating Scale Depression ( HAM-D ) Hamilton Rating Scale Anxiety ( HAM-A ) score observed MG CG . II . A great decrease HIV risk behavior observe MG CG . III . A great improvement sleep structure observe MG CG . IV . The proportion subject experience severe adverse drug reaction necessitate termination study one study clinician differ MG CG . V. Retention great MG CG .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Mirtazapine Depressed Cocaine Dependent Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cocaine dependence significant public health problem associate serious medical , psychiatric , social economic consequence . It generally accept euphoria associate cocaine use result action reward pathways via antagonist property dopamine transporter site ; cocaine also inhibit reuptake serotonin norepinephrine . These action think underlie cocaine 's potent reinforcing property . With prolonged use , cocaine may deplete neurotransmitter , affect postsynaptic receptor density , elicit overall dysregulation neurotransmitter system . These long term consequence may account post-cocaine depressive symptom often claim cocaine user contribute relapse . Treatment cocaine dependence present primarily psychosocial/behavioral . Currently pharmacological agent approve treatment cocaine dependence conjunction psychosocial intervention . Several drug currently approve indication presently consideration treatment cocaine dependence base know mechanism sit action . Current approach include strategy ( 1 ) block effect cocaine , ( 2 ) substitute cocaine , ( 3 ) reduce crave enhance addict 's ability manage his/her response craving , ( 4 ) treat underlying condition ( consequence cocaine use ) may predispose toward dependence .</detailed_description>
