	<brief_summary>This multicentre SHARF4 ( Stuivenberg Hospital Acute Renal Failure ) study aim investigate outcome patient acute renal failure ( ARF ) , stratify accord severity disease ( SHARF score ) randomise different treatment option . All adult patient serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl include . Patients stratify accord disease severity need RRT randomise intermittent ( IRRT ) continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intermittent Versus Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy Acute Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects . Hospitals qualify participation least 600 bed , centre treatment End Stage Kidney Disease ( ESKD ) patient , multipurpose ICU least 12 bed , least 30 patient ARF treat RRT last year regular use intermittent continuous technique . A centre questionnaire send candidate centre order check qualify criterion . Qualified Belgian ICU unit include adult ( age Â³ 18 year old ) patient serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dl consecutively admit . All patient know pre-existing chronic renal disease , define serum creatinine 1.5 mg clearly reduce kidney size ultrasound exclude . Severity define calculate SHARF score subject fulfil inclusion criterion . Patients stratify 3 class ( SHARF &lt; 30 , 30-60 , &gt; 60 ) . Within stratum , need renal replacement therapy randomise daily IRRT ( intermittent haemodialysis 4-6 hour daily ) CRRT ( continuous veno-venous hemofiltration ) , none predefined contraindication randomisation present . Data collection . The following basic data collect : demographic ( age , sex , weight height ) , course hospitalisation ( date admission hospital ICU , date discharge ICU hospital date death ) , date ARF diagnosis , type ARF ( prerenal , renal , postrenal , acute chronic disease ) , cause ARF ( acute tubular necrosis , acute glomerulonephritis , acute interstitial nephritis , systemic disease ) , primary disease type ( medical - toxic , medical - , surgical , obstetric ) serum creatinine different time point hospitalisation . Parameters SHARF score collect first day criterion ARF meet . For patient refer ICU later course ARF , day admission ICU start day . Overall severity evaluate APACHE II score baseline SOFA score diagnosis ARF 24 48 hour . The following short-term outcome parameter measure : hospital mortality , length stay ICU hospital GFR hospital discharge accord Cockroft Gault formula . Allocation treatment . From previous SHARF study , learn 50 % patient would need RRT treatment . The decision treat conservatively start RRT discretion attend physician , take account rule good clinical practice field . The choice RRT treatment modality randomise within stratum SHARF score . Randomisation perform electronically per centre . In order avoid selection bias , consecutive patient include . If patient could randomise reason , reason document electronic Case Report Form ( CRF ) . Renal Replacement Therapy . The technique use perform RRT agreement standard procedure participate hospital . Therefore , candidate centre complete questionnaire current renal replacement strategy ARF . The strategy choose protocol result questionnaire . For IRRT central venous access , synthetic membrane ( polysulfone AN 69 ) , bicarbonate dialysate use . Daily dialysis perform 4-6 hour per session blood flow 100-300 ml/min dialysate flow 100-500 ml/min . For CRRT central venous access synthetic membrane ( polysulfone AN 69 ) use . Continuous veno-venous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) prefer method . It continue 24 hour per day blood flow rate 100-200 ml/min , substitution rate 1-2 L per hour either lactate bicarbonate solution use . For modality , anticoagulation perform accord centre practice either unfractionated heparin , low molecular weight heparin citrate . The randomly assign treatment modality IRRT CRRT continue daily least 3 consecutive day . Thereafter treatment could continue accord needs patient discretion investigator . The motivation change randomise plan treatment record electronic CRF . Data RRT treatment record include date , type treatment , effective duration , ultrafiltration rate artificial kidney . Sample size calculation The sample calculation base assumption overall mortality would 50 % former SHARF study difference 10 % mortality IRRT CRRT detect clinically relevant . With first order error 5 % power 80 % sample size 407 patient need renal replacement group . Since 50 % include patient would consider renal replacement therapy , total 1628 patient include . Statistical analysis . The data analysis perform accord intention-to-treat principle . Univariate analysis perform parameter order find significant difference group use Student 's t-test Chi square test . Life table analysis use compare hospital survival treatment group Cox proportional hazard regression control covariates . Multivariate analysis perform use logistic regression mortality dependant outcome variable . Confounding factor select show significant difference comparison treatment option contribute effectively independently observe outcome . For subgroup analysis , selection base report evidence subgroup include complicated patient show high co-morbidity mortality . Statistical significance set .05 level ( two-sided ) . All analysis perform use SPSS , version 12.0 . Institutional Review Board The protocol approve initially Ethics Committee Public Sector Antwerp Ethics Committee participate centre . A write informed consent ask patient representative case patient unconscient intubate .</detailed_description>
