	<brief_summary>This Phase II trial combination oxaliplatin ( Eloxatin ) capecitabine ( Xeloda ) , know XELOX , participant unresectable recurrent cholangiocarcinoma , include carcinoma gallbladder biliary tract , intrahepatic extrahepatic . Participants may either previously untreated treat chemotherapy . Participants accrue two stratum base pre-treatment status ; separate response rate statistical operate characteristic apply stratum . The primary objective determine objective response rate ( complete plus partial ) XELOX population . Secondary objective include determine toxicity , stable disease rate , median overall survival participant treat combination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin cause death cancer cell actively divide cell interfere DNA function . Capecitabine cause death cancer cell interfere certain molecule important cell division . After screen portion study , eligible continue , begin treatment oxaliplatin capecitabine . Once treatment begin , come M. D. Anderson least every three week ( 21 day ) treatment . Each 21-day period treatment call `` cycle '' therapy . You receive least 3 cycle therapy unless side effect severe cancer grows quickly . You need small tube ( central venous line ) insert large vein skin chest vein arm receive oxaliplatin . The central venous line remain place entire time take part study . Oxaliplatin must give M. D. Anderson . On Day 1 cycle , receive oxaliplatin inject vein 2 hour . You take capecitabine tablet mouth 2 time day first 2 week ( Days 1-14 ) 3-week cycle . No treatment give last 7 day cycle ( except first dose capecitabine new cycle take evening , last dose take morning Day 15 . ) You must take capecitabine within 30 minute breakfast dinner . The morning evening dose 12 hour apart . You take capecitabine water , fruit juice . At first treatment visit every 3 week , receive enough capecitabine last next visit . At visit , must return capecitabine use well empty bottle . Before new cycle therapy , complete physical exam blood ( 2 Â½ teaspoon ) collect routine test . You ask tell study doctor medication take since start take study drug health problem may experience . During first cycle , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) sample collect week routine test . You also either CT scan MRI tumor ( ) every 9 week end study . Additional test may do study doctor feel necessary care . If experience severe side effect , treatment may delay , stop , may receive small dos treatment . You may continue receive treatment study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If happens , take study doctor discus treatment option . When stop take part study , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) collect routine test . You physical exam either CT scan MRI check status disease . You contact phone every three month rest life check status disease symptom may experience . All test new cycle treatment treatment stop must do M. D. Anderson . This investigational study . The drug oxaliplatin capecitabine FDA approve treatment advance cancer colon rectum . However , drug approve gallbladder biliary tract cancer . Up 50 participant take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically confirm carcinoma gallbladder , intrahepatic extrahepatic biliary tract , amenable resection curative intent . Participants must measurable disease per modify Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension , minimum lesion size equal twice slice thickness image study use . Participants previously untreated well receive prior therapy eligible participate study . Participants may receive total two prior chemotherapy regimen disease , include biologic therapy ( y ) . The regimen may receive different time course Participant 's treatment . Surgery , radiofrequency ablation , external beam radiotherapy , direct therapy count prior regimen allow . Previous treatment may include systemic chemotherapy , however , prior capecitabine ( unless administer radiosensitizing agent concurrently prior external beam radiotherapy ) oxaliplatin exclude . If radiation previously receive , measurable disease must recurrent metastatic disease outside previous radiation field . A minimum 4 week must elapse since completion prior chemotherapy radiotherapy . Participants life expectancy least 16 week base clinical judgment Investigator . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status &lt; /= 2 Karnofsky &gt; 70 . Adequate bone marrow function define absolute peripheral granulocyte count &gt; /= 1500/mm3 , platelet count &gt; /= 100,000/ mm3 , hemoglobin &gt; /= 10 gm/dL . Adequate renal function , define serum creatinine &lt; /= 1.5 time ULN institutional normal calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 30 mL/min ( use Cockcroft Gault formula ) . Participants must adequate hepatic function : total bilirubin &lt; /= 2.0 gm/dL ; serum albumin &gt; /= 2.5 gm/dL ; transaminases 5 time upper limit institutional normal value ; prothrombin time prolonged 2 second great institutional normal value . Negative serum pregnancy test woman childbearing potential . The effect combination oxaliplatin capecitabine develop fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Participants must sign Informed Consent Authorization indicate aware investigational nature study know risk involve . Age &gt; /=18 year . Participants take therapeutic doselevels coumarinderivate anticoagulant switch low Low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) . Lowdose coumadin ( e.g . 1 mg po per day ) Participants indwell venous access device , allow . Prior therapy oxaliplatin capecitabine ; capecitabine administer radiosensitizing agent concurrently prior external beam radiotherapy allowable . Participants chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas Mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Participants may receive investigational agent receive investigational drug &lt; /= 30 day prior enrollment . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical therapy affect absorption . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Because Participants immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy , HIVpositive Participants receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction XELOX . Appropriate study undertake Participants receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Participants extensive symptomatic fibrosis lung . Peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 . Known DPD deficiency . Participants receive therapeutic dos coumarinderivative anticoagulant therapy exclude since drug interaction capecitabine coumarin anticoagulant report . Participants require anticoagulation may safely switch LMWH eligible .</criteria>
