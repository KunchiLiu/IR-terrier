	<detailed_description>Aortic stenosis ( AS ) common valvular disease second common indication cardiac surgery Western country . AS prevalence increase age age population , AS major public health problem . AS due calcium deposit within aortic valve . Calcium deposit progressive eventually lead reduced leaflet motion obstruction leave ventricular outflow . There currently effective medical therapy . Once stenosis severe patient symptomatic , outcome poor unless surgery ( aortic valve replacement ) promptly perform . AS long consider passive degenerative process . Recent data challenge concept , show AS active highly regulated process similarity atherosclerosis . However , AS progression highly variable one individual another determinant AS progression poorly know . Their identification crucial want develop new medical strategy . The aims present study identify determinant AS progression specifically evaluate role lipid , inflammation platelet aggregation .</detailed_description>
