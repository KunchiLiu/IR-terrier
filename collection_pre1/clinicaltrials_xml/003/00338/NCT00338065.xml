	<detailed_description>Glaucoma second lead cause blindness United States , yet pathogenesis poorly understood . This insidious disorder since loss peripheral vision occurs first usually notice victim . Approximately 1 million people United States glaucoma , aware . Glaucoma always associate elevated intraocular pressure vision screening measure intraocular pressure without assess optic nerve also miss patient glaucomatous damage . Therefore , patient often diagnose severe irreversible vision loss . Vascular insufficiency abnormal autoregulation versus mechanical pressure damage propose major factor development glaucoma . Presently , therapy base upon lower intraocular pressure . If contributing intermittent pressure elevation factor elucidate characterized , specific treatment modality may develop effectiveness monitor .</detailed_description>
