	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) irregular heart rhythm occur 30 % 40 % patient follow heart surgery . This irregular heart rhythm , although often self-limiting , cause concern . AF associate two-fold increase patient complication mortality heart surgery . During AF , heart muscle contract properly cause blood flow heart slow potentially form clot . A clot may enter blood stream carry brain , possibly cause stroke . Patients persistent AF require blood thinner prevent stroke , carry bleed risk especially elderly patient . Patients AF heart surgery spend twice many day intensive care unit 3 4 day hospital , hence impact hospital resource quite significant . Various medication use prevent AF heart surgery unable completely prevent complication medication associate side effect . In effort optimize care heart surgery patient , strategy set eliminate onset AF surgery , oppose try control AF less effective medication , necessity . We propose study determine isolate misfire area cause AF time bypass surgery high-risk patient decrease occurrence AF follow heart surgery . Consenting patient randomize one two group . Group 1 undergo bypass surgery plus additional procedure pulmonary vein isolation Group 2 undergo bypass surgery , without additional procedure . Four staff cardiac surgeon London Health Sciences Centre perform surgery . Patients see postoperatively every six month follow two-year period .

	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) well recognize postoperative complication associate cardiac surgery occur approximately 30 % 40 % patient . AF occur frequently within 24 72 hour surgery . Even though postoperative AF often short-lived , self-limiting complication , associate two-fold increase cardiovascular mortality morbidity . Patients often symptomatic due irregular and/or rapid ventricular rate complain palpitation , anxiety , diminish physical capacity . Postoperative AF associate increased incidence complication increase hospital length stay overall cost . Patients may also develop congestive heart failure hemodynamic instability result complication . As result stasis leave atrium , risk thromboembolic complication increase incidence postoperative stroke increase . Patients persistent AF 13-fold high hospital stroke rate patient without persistent AF . Further morbidity add patient require anticoagulation AF last great 48 hour . Elderly patient require anticoagulation significantly increase risk hemorrhagic complication . The incidence ventricular arrhythmia also increase patient AF develop cardiac operation . Postoperative AF immense impact cardiac surgery patient hospital resource . One study determine patient develop AF cardiac surgery spend twice many day Intensive Care Unit patient without AF , hospital stay extend 3-4 days.Strategies aim prevent postoperative AF necessary optimize postoperative care patient undergo open heart operation . A large number clinical trial evaluate effectiveness various pharmacologic modality decrease rate AF follow cardiac surgery . A recent meta-analysis demonstrate beta blocker , sotalol amiodarone reduce risk postoperative AF mark difference . However , neither agent completely eliminate occurrence postoperative AF . In large available beta blocker prevention trial , metoprolol decrease prevalence postoperative AF 39 % 31 % . The mechanism AF follow cardiac surgery well understood , possible etiology include rapid fire ectopic focus multiple reentrant circuit within atrium propagate rhythm . It discover chronic paroxysmal AF , pulmonary vein surround ostial area frequently contain focal trigger re-entrant circuit critical initiation AF . In study 45 patient frequent episode AF refractory drug therapy , 94 % ectopic beat responsible instigate AF locate pulmonary vein . Studies show foci responsive radiofrequency ablation . Although never use prevention postoperative AF , circumferential pulmonary vein ablation ( CPVA ) technique show much success treatment AF . In CPVA , radiofrequency lesion create around ostia pulmonary vein , aim electrically isolate vein leave atrium . In one study , 26 patient resistant AF treat CPVA 64 % sinus rhythm restoration ablation . In addition , 85 % patient free AF 9 month , 62 % long require antiarrhythmic drug 23 % take drug ineffective ablation . Radiofrequency pulmonary vein isolation electro-anatomic guidance safe effective treatment AF . Recently , Medtronic develop Cardioblate® BP BP 2 Surgical Ablation System device ( Minneapolis , MN ) perform pulmonary vein isolation treat AF . Vichol et al demonstrated mean ablation time 15.2 second per lesion use device . It clearly evident postoperative AF increase morbidity , length hospital stay , cost associate surgical coronary artery revascularization . The current prophylactic agent completely effective eliminate occurrence postoperative AF . It show pulmonary vein isolation effective method treat patient chronic AF . We propose study determine perform pulmonary vein isolation Cardioblate® BP 2 adjunct patient undergo routine coronary artery bypass surgery , increase risk develop postoperative AF , significantly reduce occurrence complication . If pulmonary vein isolation find considerably decrease incidence postoperative AF , associate morbidity also decrease . This profound effect delivery care patient ischemic heart disease . Study Question/Purpose : In patient increase risk develop postoperative atrial fibrillation follow coronary artery bypass grafting , pulmonary vein isolation Cardioblate® BP 2 result decrease incidence postoperative atrial fibrillation compare patient adjunct procedure ? Hypothesis : Pulmonary vein isolation Cardioblate® BP 2 reduce incidence postoperative atrial fibrillation patient undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting increase risk develop postoperative atrial fibrillation . Sample Size A sample size 79 patient per group calculate detect reduction incidence postoperative atrial fibrillation 40 % 20 % use two-sided α = 0.05 power 80 % . Blinding-The patient , outcome assessor , data analyst blind group patient belong . Allocation concealment practice randomization scheme reveal . Due nature intervention , possible blind surgeon perform operation . Trial Implementation After randomization complete , baseline demographic characteristic patient record . Those patient randomize control group undergo coronary bypass graft cardiopulmonary bypass . Those patient randomize experimental group undergo coronary artery bypass graft cardiopulmonary bypass ( CABG ) pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) . Medtronic 's Cardioblate® BP 2 use pulmonary vein isolation . The follow take place patient : 1 . Will transfer Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit follow surgery 2 . Cardiac rhythm monitor telemetry CSRU floor discharge home 3 . All arrhythmias document regard onset , duration , immediate management - record research assistant 4 . All patient start beta blocker POD # 1 continue minimum 2 year tolerable - discontinue adverse effect ( i.e. , heart block , decrease cardiac output , allergic reaction ) 5 . All medication document 6 . After discharge home , complication readmission document ( i.e. , development atrial fibrillation arrhythmia ) 7 . Documentation patient require anticoagulation persistent atrial fibrillation duration complication relate anticoagulation 8 . Follow-up patient surgeon , cardiologist research assistant ECG every 6 month 2 year - patient ask fill questionnaire visit may elicit symptom related arrhythmias Outcomes Statistical Analysis All outcomes analyzed biostatistician blind allocation group use intention treat principle . The primary purpose data analysis determine whether pulmonary vein isolation reduces incidence postoperative atrial fibrillation patient undergoing coronary artery bypass graft high risk develop postoperative atrial fibrillation . The primary outcome compare group Chi-square test . All patient account aim 100 % follow-up patient .</detailed_description>
