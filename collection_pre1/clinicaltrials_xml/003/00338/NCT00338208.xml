	<brief_summary>We wish evaluate potential training program patient glaucoma , become efficient user prescribe low vision device distance near vision task . We hypothesize device improve efficiency . Prescribed device include stand magnifier , handheld magnifier , spectacle magnifier near vision , handheld monocular ( telescope ) bioptic telescope ( spectacle-mounted telescope ) distance vision . The success able use optical device dependent upon training . Optical device currently accept used patient visual condition decrease central vision . The bioptic telescope pair glass small telescope mount within carrier lens . The glass look feel like normal pair glass , black device ( telescope ) protrude top one lens well identify distance object . The spectacle magnifier mount pair glass also near vision</brief_summary>
