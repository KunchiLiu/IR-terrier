	<brief_summary>Glaucoma surgery perform child less 3 year old infantile glaucoma untreated cause blindness . Glaucoma uncontrolled high eye pressure child often due incomplete development part eye normally allow fluid drain eye . Two procedure possible equal success lower eye pressure . However , one ( goniotomy procedure ) prefer since take 10 minute rather 1 hour ( trabeculotomy procedure ) perform general anesthesia . This important young child reduce anesthesia exposure especially eye need surgery . If glaucoma cause cornea front eye become cloudy , view poor place lens cornea use needle perform shorter procedure . However , small endoscope FDA approve use eye allow direct view area need treatment . A needle attach endoscope allow short goniotomy perform rather proceed longer trabeculotomy procedure . The outcome measure study anesthesia time reduction intraocular pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>b . The standard examination anesthesia initially perform include measure child 's intraocular pressure , measure dimension eye , examine front eye operate microscope , examine portion eye fluid drain , evaluate back eye ultrasound , possible documentation photograph . When diagnosis confirm examination , eye eye carefully evaluate clarity . If standard goniotomy procedure do , endoscopic goniotomy perform . The procedure identical : cleaning eyelid skin , use speculum open eyelid , make small cut cornea , place viscoelastic substance eye maintain shape . The procedure differs since insert needle attach view endoscope . I view inside eye TV monitor addition look operate microscope . This allow directly see structure I need cut . Normally , I depend upon look lens place cornea must fairly clear I see cut structure standard procedure . The procedure take much longer standard goniotomy amount tissue cut standard goniotomy . The needle remove . The remainder procedure identical include place stitch corneal incision , adjust amount fluid eye pressure low high , give dilate drop , give steroid antibiotic injection around eye , give steroid ointment eye patch .</detailed_description>
