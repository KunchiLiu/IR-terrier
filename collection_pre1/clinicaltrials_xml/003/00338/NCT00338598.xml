	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Schizophrenia affect 1 % general population highly disable disease . Additionally , rate alcohol dependency patient schizophrenia high . There establish treatment alcohol dependency negative symptom schizophrenia . This study examine whether addition glycine neuroleptic medication help patient schizophrenia alcoholism decrease drinking well improve negative symptom . RESEARCH PLAN : An abnormality glutamate neurotransmitter system hypothesize alcoholism schizophrenia . Studies suggest amino acid glycine may improve alcohol dependency symptom schizophrenia act N methyl D aspartate ( NMDA ) glutamate receptor . Glycine cause reversal effect ethanol animal study improve mood , social withdrawal call `` negative symptom '' schizophrenia . Consequently , use glycine patient schizophrenia alcohol dependency may potentially decrease alcohol crave alcohol consumption also improve certain symptom schizophrenia . The potential glycine improve alcohol dependency negative symptom could represent important step improvement quality life patient schizophrenia . METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS/RESULTS : In order test hypothesis , use double blind , placebo control study measure number drink , degree crave alcohol symptom schizophrenia among parameter . Our principal approach analyse medication effectiveness application linear mixed effect model . The linear mixed effect model permit flexible approach study change individual time random effect , require patient data measure point . Our principal model analysis include treatment ( placebo glycine ) , subject factor , time , within subject factor . Compliance also include time vary independent variable . This project continue recruit subject .</detailed_description>
