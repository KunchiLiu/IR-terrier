	<brief_title>A Study Assess Disability Anemic Elderly Patients With Kidney Disease Receiving PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label study PROCRIT® ( Epoetin Alfa ) give weekly basis start dose low currently approve U.S. FDA treatment begin high hemoglobin usual . There recent evidence suggest problem disability occur person 65 high hemoglobin previously recognize . Currently , PROCRIT® ( Epoetin Alfa ) prescribe patient chronic kidney disease three time week dose approximately 5,000 10,000 unit per injection depend patient 's weight . This study start low dose treatment begin earlier normally would . Currently , doctor usually begin PROCRIT® ( Epoetin Alfa ) patient chronic kidney disease hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dL . In study PROCRIT® ( Epoetin Alfa ) give weekly basis start 5,000 unit per injection hemoglobin &lt; 12 g/dL . Each week hemoglobin check four week treatment &lt; 13 g/dL , PROCRIT® ( Epoetin Alfa ) dose increase 10,000 Units . After another four week treatment hemoglobin &lt; 13 g/dL , PROCRIT® ( Epoetin Alfa ) increase 20,000 unit . After another four week treatment hemoglobin &lt; 13 g/dL , PROCRIT® ( Epoetin Alfa ) increase final dose 40,000 unit . In study , patient treat dos higher currently approve patient chronic kidney disease . The primary measure efficacy assess use two disability test measure physical function compare baseline Week 5 , Week 9 , Week 13 , Week 17/ Early Withdrawal Week 20/Follow-up . The first test call `` Short Physical Performance Battery '' ( SPP ) test well someone sits , stand walk . The second test call `` Six Minute Walk Test '' ( 6MWT ) measure far someone walk six-minute period . Normal walk aid allow test . The study also evaluate hemoglobin level , number transfusion , safety , incidence anti-erythropoietin antibody , Quality Life cognitive function ( measure clearly one thinking ) . The study hypothesis physical function improve hemoglobin level increase . Patients receive PROCRIT® ( Epoetin Alfa ) weekly basis start 5,000 unit per injection ( maximum 40,000 unit ) .</detailed_description>
