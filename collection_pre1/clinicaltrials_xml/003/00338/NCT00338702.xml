	<brief_title>A Randomized , Controlled Trial Autologous Platelet Gel Treatment Diabetic Foot Ulcers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This single center , randomize , control , prospective study compare use autologous platelet gel ( study group ) traditional moist dressing ( control group ) treatment plantar forefoot ulcer . Specific Aims Primary - Facilitation heal diabetic foot ulcer Secondary - Reduction amputation average total cost care . Determine impact diabetic ulcer patient ' quality life Research Background Foot ulcer represent significant common complication patient diabetes . It estimate twenty percent patient diabetes develop foot ulcer may subsequently lead knee amputation . 85 % precede non-healing foot ulcer . Health care cost associate diabetic foot wound management stagger . Armstrong et al ( 1998 ) report wound care foot ulcer patient two year period mean cost $ 27,000.00 U.S . In Toronto , average cost knee amputation , include hospitalization rehabilitation , $ 40,000.00 . Wound heal context diabetes challenge health care provider patient . In systematic review conduct Margolis et al ( 1999 ) , wind heal outcomes use best practice yield 24 % 12 week , 31 % 20 week . Falanga &amp; Sabolinski ( 2001 ) identify initial wound size reduction 0.1 cm/week highly predictive wound closure whereas initial heal rate 0.06 cm less predict non-healing . Similarly , 51 % percent reduction 4 week find good predictor achieve wound closure ( Margolis et al , 1999 ) . Some wound respond considerable effort direct therapy improve rate heal situation . A variety growth factor use stimulate wound healing . Human platelets autologous source probably stimulate healing . Autologous platelet gel ( APG ) material presently utilized tissue adhesive . It derive platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) first develop early 1990 's primarily address acute surgical hemostatic wound heal problem . APG prepared centrifugation autologous human whole blood , initially separate three component : pack red cell , platelet poor plasma , platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) . PRP two eight time normal concentration platelet human blood . The key element differentiate APG traditional fibrin glue presence concentrate platelet rich platelet growth factor . These important element blood , increase concentration potentially helpful improve rate wound heal . This study investigate potential improvement wound heal APG diabetic foot ulcer . Rationale Research - To determine topical APG ( autologous platelet gel ) beneficial treatment diabetic foot ulcer . - To determine result faster rate wound heal . - To determine improve quality life patient diabetic foot ulcer Study Population Subjects study recruit patient population .

The patient may withdraw study discretion investigator judge noncompliant study procedure worsen patient condition 2 . Detection osteomyelitis treatable debridement antibiotic discretion investigator 3 . Development progressive wound necrosis Experimental Methods For study purpose , diabetic foot ulcer wound plantar aspect foot respond least 4 week best practice care . Complete wound closure define skin closure ( 100 % re-epithelization ) without drainage dressing requirement . Patients seek treatment diabetic foot ulcer meet entry criterion consider study . Patients randomize either STUDY CONTROL group 1:1 control study ratio . STUDY Group Patients APG ( autologous platelet gel ) apply wound accordance institutional treatment protocol manufacturer 's guideline . Dressing change occur least three time week . Method prepare application autologous platelet gel follow - 1 . Obtain 54 cc whole blood 60 cc syringe 6 cc citrate anticoagulant standard blood draw technique . 2 . Slowly load blood fill syringe GPS II unit 's centre port . And centrifuge 15 minute . 3 . Draw PRP ( Platelet Rich Plasma ) concentrate GPS II unit 10 cc syringe . 4 . Prepare wound bed sharp excision eperbole , necrotic tissue &amp; wound bed . 5 . Aspirate PPP ( Platelet Poor Plasma ) GPSII unit 30 ml syringe . 6 . Inject Thrombin Reagent ( 5 cc CaCl2 ) Thrombin Processing Device add 11 cc PPP syringe mix let stand 20 minute . 7 . Draw 1 cc thrombin/CaCl2 solution 1 cc syringe Thrombin Processing Device . 8 . Connect syringe PRP syringe thrombin/CaCl2 dual sprayer 9 . Spray solution entire wound bed . Protect surround skin ( wound ) barrier film . 10 . Apply semi-permeable , film-type dress primary dressing . Leave dress place 3-7 day . 11 . The affected limb receive offload form total contact cast , pneumatic walking cast wheelchair . 12 . After first dress APG wound dress moist dressing , similar control group dressing . The dressing change daily Monday-Wednesday-Friday routine base level exudate . CONTROL Group Weekly standard therapy alone follow : 1 . Any debridement deem necessary perform 2 . Ulcer-site dressed moist dress cadexamer iodine ointment ( Iodosorb ) absorbent cover dress moisture retentive . Acceptable control group dress type : alginates , hydrogel hydrocolloid saline gauze . The dress change daily Monday-Wednesday-Friday routine base level exudate . 3 . The affected limb receive offload form total contact cast , pneumatic walking cast wheelchair . Treatment Phase Study : Treatment group continue wound successfully close . At 12 week ( 3 month ) wound control treatment group evaluate . If wound show sign improvement ( wound closure 50 % 3 month ) wind consider treatment failure treat alternate dress accord hospital standard care . These wound follow every month till close . 6-Month 12 month follow-up : For patient achieve wound closure 12 week , later wound site undergo examination recurrence . No patient remain study longer 12 month ( total study duration ) . Clinical Assessments A . Wound Debridement All wound study surgically debrided The wound may debrided autolysis sharp wound debridement tolerate . B . Laboratory Testing Up seven day prior initiation protocol treatment , blood sample take determine serum pre-albumin , albumin creatinine level .
