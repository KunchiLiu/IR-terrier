	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effectiveness safety PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) high start dose ( 60,000 Units ) per week , follow less frequent dose ( 60,000 Units every two week ) patient cancer chemotherapy induce anemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alternate Dosing PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Patients With Cancer Chemotherapy Induced Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , non-randomized , multicenter pilot study patient receive chemotherapy non-myeloid malignancy ( cancer ) baseline hemoglobin ( Hb ) &lt; = 11 g/dL enrol . The primary objective pilot study estimate hematologic response dose regimen PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) , start dose 60,000 Units ( U ) administer subcutaneously ( sc , skin ) per week ( qw ) four week ( `` Phase A '' ) , follow dose 60,000 U every two week ( q2w ) ( `` Phase B '' ) patient cancer chemotherapy induce anemia . If , time study Hb level rise &gt; 13 g/dL , PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) therapy hold Hb reach &lt; =12 g/dL , resume reduce dose Phase A Phase B . The dose also reduce rapid Hb response occur ( i.e . increase 1.3 g/dL 2-week period ) . The secondary objective study determine incidence anti-erythropoietin antibody ( anti-EPO Ab ) , baseline end study/early withdrawal patient receive minimum one dose PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) . Rarely , anti-erythropoietin antibody may form patient types disease ( e.g. , autoimmune disease , rheumatoid arthritis , anemia chronic disease ) , response exposure erythropoietin product Epoetin alfa necessitate discontinuation erythropoietin agent medical treatment may include blood transfusion . Safety evaluation include clinical laboratory test ( hemoglobin hematocrit ) , vital sign measurement ( blood pressure ) , incidence severity adverse event . This study determine high initial weekly dos result higher initial response rate and/or brisk hemoglobin rise . Patients receive PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 60,000 Units ( U ) week 4 week . At Week 5 hemoglobin increase &gt; = 1 g/dL baseline , PROCRIT dose change 60,000 U every 2 week &lt; = 12 week . An additional PROCRIT dose give chemotherapy complete Week 16 .</detailed_description>
