	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness safety PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) start dose 60,000 Units ( U ) every week ( QW ) target hemoglobin ( Hb ) 12 g/dL ( Initiation Phase ) , follow dose 80,000 Units every three week ( Q3W ) maintain Hb range 11.5 12.5 g/dL ( Maintenance Phase ) cancer patient receive chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Efficacy Safety Study PROCRIT ( Epoetin Alfa ) Cancer Patients Receiving Chemotherapy Every Three Weeks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epoetin alfa administer three time weekly ( 150 U/kg ) weekly ( 40,000 U ) result response rate ( define &gt; = 2 g/dL Hb increase Hb &gt; = 12 g/dL ) approximately 65 % anemic chemotherapy patient produce mean hemoglobin ( Hg ) rise 1.8 g/dL . Higher weekly dosing epoetin alfa may result high response rate timely mean hemoglobin rise remain safe . Additionally , limit data available show whether epoetin alfa maintenance therapy administer less frequently weekly still maintain hemoglobin level . This open label , multicenter , non-randomized study determine safety effectiveness epoetin alfa give cancer patient receive chemotherapy every three week . Patients receive injection PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) 60,000 Units ( U ) weekly ( QW ) skin 12 week ( Initiation Phase ) achieve hemoglobin ( Hg ) level 12 g/dL next full chemotherapy cycle . At time begin Maintenance Phase receive 4 injection Epoetin alfa 80,000 U every 3 week ( Q3W ) skin additional 12 week . Doses hold adjust downward hemoglobin level rise &gt; 13 g/dL rapid hemoglobin response occur ( e.g. , increase 1.3 g/dL 2-week period ) . Safety evaluation include clinical laboratory test ( hemoglobin hematocrit ) , vital sign measurement ( blood pressure ) , adverse event . In addition , antibody develop erythropoietin evaluate patient receive multiple dos PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) . Patients receive injection Epoetin alfa 60,000 Units ( U ) weekly ( QW ) skin 12 week ( Initiation Phase ) achieve hemoglobin ( Hg ) level 12 g/dL next full chemotherapy cycle . At time begin Maintenance Phase receive 4 injection Epoetin alfa 80,000 U every 3 week ( Q3W ) skin additional 12 week .</detailed_description>
