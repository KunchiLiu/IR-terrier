	<detailed_description>This multicenter pilot study ass heal effect HO/03/03 diabetic neuropathic plantar venous ulcer . Pretreatment phase : During pretreatment phase last 14 day , patient receive conventional treatment day discretion investigator . All wound morphologically monitor photo documentation daily measurement wound area week . Initial study visit : patient begin treatment complete necessary demand pre-treatment phase ruling exclusion criterion . All wound clean previous treatment surgical debridement irrigation ( saline ) . Treatment phase : Following pre-treatment phase , wound treat topically HO/03/03 30 day . During 30 day phase , patient receive daily treatment HO/03/03 either home certify nurse clinic . Wounds monitor certified medical staff member well photo documentation . Then application treatment follow 15-minute rest . Finally wound dress fresh dress monitoring adverse event . Patients administer HO/03/03 addition weight off-load Once week wound monitor physician : wound size determine document . Patients evaluate pain sensation wound area fill pain score questionnaire . Twice experiment patient undergo blood profile , HbA1c , blood glucose , urine sample test initial terminate visit . At conclusion treatment phase follow complete : - A physical examination ; - Collection blood urine sample clinical laboratory test ( dip stick ) ;</detailed_description>
