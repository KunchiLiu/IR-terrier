	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination Femara ( letrozole ) Gleevec ( imatinib mesylate ) shrink slow growth tumor patient hormonal sensitive advance breast cancer . Primary Objectives : - To determine efficacy Letrozole plus Imatinib Mesylate patient ER PgR positive metastatic breast cancer . Efficacy measure rate clinical tumor response . - To determine safety tolerability Letrozole plus Imatinib Mesylate patient metastatic breast cancer . - To determine time disease progression overall survival patient metastatic breast cancer treat Letrozole plus Imatinib Mesylate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Letrozole ( Femara ) Plus Imatinib Mesylate ( Gleevec ) Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Letrozole antihormonal drug use standard treatment advance hormonal sensitive breast cancer . Imatinib mesylate drug ( chemotherapy ) bind certain protein tumor cell prevent growth . Imatinib mesylate think prevent potential resistance letrozole , may make letrozole effective . Before treatment start , blood test ( 2-4 teaspoon ) , CT scan chest abdomen , bone scan . Blood test ( 2-4 teaspoon ) repeat every week 4 week every month length study . The blood test do evaluate drug affect breast cancer relate marker blood . These blood test do screening , Months 2 4 . The CT scan repeat every 2 month standard care . You take letrozole day mouth imatinib mesylate twice day mouth intolerable side effect occur tumor grows . You stop treatment tumor grow intolerable side effect occur . This investigational study . Letrozole FDA approve treatment advance breast cancer commercially available . Imatinib mesylate approve chronic myelogenous leukemia investigate use treatment breast cancer . A total 45 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
