	<brief_summary>Primary hypothesis test : Early protein intake predicts infant growth later risk childhood obesity . - Childhood obesity major public health problem identify priority concern health care . Infants feed formula likely become obese breastfed infant . The high protein content infant formula , compare breast milk , could causal factor . - The study multicentre intervention trial newborn infant investigate whether feed infant formula , differ level milk protein , influence risk later childhood obesity . The trial take place five country different habitual total protein intakes increase range protein intakes - The investigator study body composition , hormonal status , protein metabolism anthropometric marker childhood obesity . The whole cohort follow age 11 year , assess long term impact prevalence obesity . - The investigator explore impact consumer ( parental ) attitude , perception , different practice infant feed relation infant behaviour ( satisfaction , cry , sleep duration ) . This consumer science information help improve understanding consumer ( infant parent ) acceptance preference food contribute healthy diet . - If relationship early dietary protein intake later childhood obesity risk confirm , offer possibility prevention obesity , improve advice give parent develop nutritionally improve dietary product infant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>European Childhood Obesity Project : Early Programming Infant Nutrition ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity become global epidemic major health challenge child ado-lescents industrialised country , high steadily increase prevalence . Individual obesity risk strongly influence genetic disposition lifestyle factor . But addition , clear indication metabolic event pre- postnatal development mark-edly modulate obesity risk later life , know metabolic programming . Epidemiological study animal experiment suggest causal relationship nutrition early life risk later obesity , e.g . breast feeding seem reduce risk obesity . One factor clearly different breast formula feed infant protein intake , thus CHOPIN influence factor test feed double blind random-ised clinical trial two formulas different protein content ( 7.3 % vs. 12 % energy ) infants five European country ( Belgium , Germany , Italy , Poland , Spain ) . Protein supply via formula define first year life , additional food record . Until age 2 year growth development infant follow frequent stand-ardised measurement data socio-economic status , parental attitude medical his-tory collect . The available data evaluate respect influence protein intake factor anthropometric marker later obesity . This seem justi-fied weight length growth age 2 year show predict body mass index 14 year , suggest suitable early indicator overweight later life . Furthermore , differences participate country study aim identify environmental factor influence obesity risk . On long term base plan follow study participant via mailed questionnaire age eight year validate risk estimator huge well define population . Primary objective : - To test influence protein content infant formula feed first year life growth age two year ( main outcome measure : length weight velocity ) . - First year protein intake predicts later risk childhood obesity ( 'Early protein hypothe-sis ' ) . Primary outcome measure : BMI age 8 year . Secondary objective : - Evaluation effect different habitual protein intakes traditional complemen-tary feeding regime infants 5 European country . - Examination relationship different type infant feed regime respect Beikost early anthropometric marker later obesity development . - Investigation effect infant feed regime body composition , energy ex-penditure , protein metabolism , renal function size , leptin bind protein IGF-1 . - Exploration consumer attitude infant feed practice relation parental obe-sity status . - Investigation mediation relationship diet later growth via bio-chemical parameter , might become detectable plasma concentration correspond compound age 6 month . - Investigation effect infant behaviour ( esp . cry , sleep feed behav-iour ) development obesity . - Comparison weight length development non randomise cohort breast-fed infant . - Measurement effect dietary regime body composition measure stable dilution technique ( subgroup ) . - Measurement effect dietary regime total energy expenditure exploration relationship TEE , body composition obesity risk ( subgroup ) .</detailed_description>
