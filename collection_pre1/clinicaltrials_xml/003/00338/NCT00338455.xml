	<brief_summary>The purpose study United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) Status 1B ( country equivalent ) cardiac transplant candidate ass safety efficacy Natrecor ( nesiritide ) . The study evaluate drug 's ability prevent clinical worsening administer 28-day continuous intravenous infusion patient receive standard care continuous intravenous infusion dobutamine milrinone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natrecor ( Nesiritide ) Transplant-Eligible Management Congestive Heart Failure-TMAC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endogenous B-type natruretic peptide ( BNP ) concentration correlate heart failure ( HF ) severity significantly elevate severe end-stage HF patient . However , normal biologic compensatory responsiveness BNP attenuate patient severe HF . Patients UNOS 1B cardiac transplant candidate relatively option therapy , despite fact constitute ill patient population . These option include get transplant , one available , receive intravenous inotropes and/or vasodilator , implant circulatory support device ( e.g . Left Ventricular Assist Device ) . Natrecor ( Nesiritide ) human recombinant form BNP approve use treatment acute decompensated HF . Limited information available control clinical trial effect Natreor ( nesiritide ) infusion longer 72 hour . However , base report literature , Natrecor ( nesiritide ) use independent investigator much long duration end-stage HF patient , include UNOS Status 1B cardiac transplant candidate , refractory standard care . In patient , Natrecor ( nesiritide ) safely administer continuous infusion 2 210 day . These experience show continuous Natrecor ( nesiritide ) infusion well tolerate , uniformly improve hemodynamics ( circulation blood force involve ) , maintain stable renal ( kidney ) function , reduce need ventricular assist device prolonged wait heart transplant . In controlled clinical trial report literature , Natrecor ( nesiritide ) give concomitantly several standard HF therapeutic agent , diuretic , angiotensin-converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , beta-blockers , dopamine , dobutamine , anticoagulant , digoxin , oral nitrate . Concomitant dose well tolerate , drug interaction observe . No randomized control trial conduct evaluate safety combination nesiritide milrinone therapy . Several investigation undertaken concern potential additive hypotensive ( lower blood pressure ) effect two agent may exert administer concurrently . The study investigator report concurrent dose milrinone nesiritide appear safe beneficial , without evidence additive hypotensive ( lower blood pressure ) effect . The TMAC trial investigate safety efficacy Natrecor ( nesiritide ) , compare placebo , add standard care management end-stage refractory HF.This prospective , randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , parallel , multicenter , double-blind ( neither doctor patient know whether patient administer placebo test drug ) , placebo-controlled study conduct UNOS Status 1B ( equivalent ) cardiac transplant candidate receive standard care continuous IV infusion dobutamine milrinone await heart transplantation . Approximately 120 patient participate study . Enrolled patient randomize 1:1 receive Natrecor ( nesiritide ) continuous infusion addition standard care one inotrope ( drug dobutamine milrinone use increase heart rate improve force cardiac contraction ) , receive placebo continuous infusion addition standard care one inotrope ( dobutamine milrinone ) . Patients manage inpatient outpatient , accord guideline protocol study center practice . All patient continue receive usual long-term cardiac medication ( exclude commercial nesiritide ) . Study drug dose adjustment may make accord guideline protocol investigator 's clinical judgment , accordance dose guidelines.Study drug administer continuous intravenous infusion control programmable ambulatory infusion pump 28-day treatment period . Patients hospitalize study drug initiation titration ensure safety , observe tolerability , achieve recommend study drug dose . Day 0 ( Screening ) entail complete require procedure randomization . Baseline screen procedure may occur day . A window 7 day permit Day 0 ( Screening ) Day 1 ( Baseline ) visit circumstance delay initiation study drug dosing . The following day , Day 1 ( Baseline ) , continuous infusion study drug begin . Patients hospitalize minimum 3 day start study drug titration dose optimization . A dose optimization period 5 day permit . Patients eligible discharge follow completion study procedures 4th dose day ( Day 4 ) . Patients return clinic weekly visit ( Â± 2 day ) Day 28 ( Termination Treatment ) Day 35 7-day post dose safety visit . On Day 28 visit ( Termination Treatment ) , Patients may hospitalize 24 hour investigator 's discretion undergo end treatment study procedure . This study include two substudies : Pulmonary Function Testing Substudy Glomerular Filtration Rate Substudy . All TMAC Patients ask participate substudies . Participation optional affect enrollment participation TMAC . The Study Hypothesis continuous administration Natrecor ( nesiritide ) 28 day add standard care ( include inotropes ) safe provide clinical benefit compare placebo add standard care ( include inotropes ) therapy . Study drug administer continuously fixed-rate infusion 28 day without bolus dose . Natrecor ( nesiritide ) dose begin 0.005 mcg/kg/min may titrate maximum dose 0.015 mcg/kg/min .</detailed_description>
