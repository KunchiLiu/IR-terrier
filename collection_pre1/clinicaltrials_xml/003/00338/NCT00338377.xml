	<detailed_description>Leptomeningeal Disease : ( Cohort D ) : Study Visits : You expect stay Houston area least 21 day order take part study . During study , follow test procedure : - You MRI complete spine brain within 1 week start therapy , Week 4 ( +/- 3 day ) , 8 week ( +/- 3 day ) Day 1 IT TIL infusion . You also MRIs brain entire spine every 2 month ( +/- 1 week ) - At baseline , start maintenance therapy IL-2 , every 2 month , CT CAP and/or PET/CT evaluate status disease . - You neurological exam ( test check function nerve , include test balance reflex ) within 1 week Day 1 IT TIL infusion start maintenance therapy IL-2 . - Blood ( 4 1/2 tablespoon time ) take surgery remove tumor tumor biopsy , treatment start Days 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 , 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 ( +7 day ) , follow-up visit ( +/- 7 day ) . These blood sample collect evaluate activity T-cells ability attack tumor . - On day receive TIL , CSF collect Ommaya reservoir infusion IT TIL match amount TIL infuse . - You neurocognitive exam ( test check memory thinking ability , example ) within 1 week Day 1 IT TIL infusion start maintenance therapy . - You complete questionnaire symptom within 1 week Day 1 start maintenance therapy . The questionnaire visit take 3 hour . CSF collect routine test either Ommaya reservoir spinal tap within 4 week Day 1 1 time week 8 week . Â°Blood ( 4.5 tablespoon ) draw monitor track TIL presence blood compare CSF 1 week first IT TIL infusion Day 15 Week 5 . During inpatient stay/observation Days 1-21 : - You physical exam within 24 hour Day 1 Day 15 IT TIL infusion - Vital sign check every 4 hour first 24 hour TIL infusion , every 8 hour day . - You neurological exam IT TIL infusion , 60-120 minute infusion , 24 ( +/- 3 hour ) hour infusion . - If possible , 14 teaspoon blood collect 1 week first IT TIL infusion Day 15 Week 5 monitor track presence TIL blood compare CSF . - If possible , 10 teaspoon blood collect Week 4 every 4 week total 16 week monitor track TIL presence blood compare CSF . Length Treatment : Depending doctor think best interest , might ask come back monthly bi-monthly basis IL-2 treatment . You longer able take IT IL IL-2 study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Follow-Up Visits : Follow-up visit schedule depend treatment schedule . Each time come follow-up , 2 tablespoon spinal fluid 10 teaspoon blood collect research purpose . As standard care patient LMD , MRI brain spine , well either CT PET/CT body also monitor rest disease . This investigational study . The medication use study FDA approve . IL-2 commercially available drug . However , use together T-cells study experimental . The T-cells authorize use research . A total 30 patient take part portion study . All enrol MD Anderson . Tissue Harvest Screening : ( Turnstile I ) : Tissue Harvest : If find eligible take part study , biopsy procedure tumor perform . A whole part tumor cut remove use high enough pain medication . This biopsy do help attempt grow T-cells necessary treatment . Your T-cells grown laboratory help radiation-exposed cell blood donor . These donor cell test negative currently screen infectious disease . If researcher unable grow enough cell tumor enough necessary component , continue study treatment option discuss . If growth cell successful , able continue study . There 6-week waiting period biopsy continue next phase study . You allow participate treatment plan time period . If abnormal result , study doctor research staff member discus . This investigational study . The T-cell vaccine therapy authorize use research . A total 189 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson Treatment Consent : ( Turnstile II ) : Study Visits : You blood sample collect evaluate activity T-cells ability attack tumor . Blood sample ( 4-1/2 tablespoon time ) take surgery remove tumor . If schedule surgery , may biopsy tumor . Blood ( 4-1/2 tablespoon ) also draw chemotherapy start Days 7 , 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 ( +7 day ) , follow-up visit ( +/- 7 day ) . This blood collect evaluate activity T-cells . You return 8 week follow-up assessment , part Melanoma Department 's standard care . If blood test show Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) past , additional blood ( 2 teaspoon ) sample draw T-cell infusion check presence CMV . The study staff check CMV level Day 3 ( +/- 24 hour ) Day 21 ( +/- 7 day ) TIL infusion added precaution . Some T-cells receive may come donor test positive CMV past . However , donor treat CMV cell collect , cell also test check CMV give . At 6 week ( + 7 day ) 12 week ( + 7 day ) receive T-cell and/or vaccine infusion ( cycle ) , return clinic physical exam repeat scan evaluate size tumor . If possible , also blood sample ( 4 1/2 tablespoon ) draw follow-up visit check effect T-cells blood cell . If doctor think need , receive pentamidine vein 1 hour every 21 day 6 month lymphodepletion . If receive pentamidine , take atovaquone mouth . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . End-of-Treatment Visit : You return 8 week follow-up evaluation per Melanoma Department 's standard care . Re-Treatment : If stable disease partial response treatment , may re-treated schedule receive . Before occurs , need evaluate . A maximum 1 re-treatment course may give participant . This investigational study . IL-2 recently approve FDA treatment metastatic melanoma . IL-2 hormone naturally find body boost immune system . It make lab , normal human gene . The T-cell vaccine therapy authorize use research . A total 189 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
