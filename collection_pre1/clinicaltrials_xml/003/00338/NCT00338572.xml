	<brief_title>Effect Exercise Diet Inflammation Hypertensive Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypertension characterize high blood pressure , well inflammation increase adhesion among blood cell . Inflammation may play important role atherosclerosis , involve build fatty deposit inside wall artery . Pharmacological treatment hypertension successfully reduce blood pressure . However , limited effectiveness reduce associate inflammation . Losing weight increase physical activity show reduce general inflammation , research need determine effect inflammation directly relate hypertension . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness exercise program versus combine exercise diet program reduce inflammation cell adhesion hypertensive individual . This study enroll inactive overweight hypertensive individual . Participants randomly assign 12-week exercise program , 12-week combine exercise diet program , non-intervention group . At study entry , participant take part speech stressor task , VO2 peak exercise test , exercise treadmill test . During speech stressor task , participant videotape talk potentially stressful situation . Prior follow speech task , blood collect , blood pressure heart rate record , standardized questionnaire complete assess anger , anxiety , stress level . The two exercise test occur within 5 day involve run treadmill . Heart rate , respiratory rate , physical activity intensity monitor ; heart activity measure electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Blood collect various time test procedure measure level inflammation biomarkers , include C-reactive protein ( CRP ) white blood cell . Perceived exertion stress level also assess . Participants exercise intervention receive 12-week membership YMCA meet personal trainer twice week . They encourage exercise additional 3 4 day per week . Participants also provide pedometer , track number step take day . Participants diet program meet dietician encourage reduce caloric intake incorporate low-fat , high-fiber food diet . Throughout study , participant regular follow-up phone call study staff meeting personal trainer and/or dietician ensure adhere assigned program . At end 12 week , participant return repeat speech stressor task , VO2 peak exercise test , exercise treadmill test . Participants non-intervention group assign either exercise program combine exercise diet program .</detailed_description>
