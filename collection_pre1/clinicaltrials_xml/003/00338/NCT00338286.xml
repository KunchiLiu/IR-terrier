	<brief_title>A Study Epoetin Alfa Plus Standard Supportive Care Versus Standard Supportive Care Only Anemic Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer Receiving Standard Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia common complication treatment metastatic breast cancer relate effect chemotherapy chronic disease . This randomized , open-label , multicenter , international study examine safety study drug use standard supportive care ( i.e. , pack RBC transfusion ) compare standard supportive care alone , use treat anemia associate chemotherapy . This study do subject metastatic breast cancer treat first-line chemotherapy standard dose schedule taxane monotherapy , taxane plus trastuzumab , anthracycline plus either taxane cyclophosphamide . The study hypothesis epoetin alfa , use supportive anemia care , increase risk tumor progression death . The study treatment compare control treatment compare progression-free survival , i.e. , number month date patient randomize trial date first document disease progression death . In addition chemotherapy , half subject assign receive study drug ( epoetin alfa ) half subject assign standard supportive care anemia . Subjects treat study drug receive standard supportive care ( pack RBC transfusion ) plus 40,000 IU epoetin alfa give subcutaneously week 4 week last cycle chemotherapy disease progression , whichever come first.The hypothesis test epoetin alfa , use supportive anemia care , non-inferior control ( standard supportive care alone ) , measure progression free survival ( PFS ) . Patients treat study drug receive standard supportive care ( pack red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion ) plus 40,000 IU epoetin alfa give subcutaneously week 4 week last cycle chemotherapy disease progression , whichever come first . Dose adjustment ( dose escalation , dose reduction , dose interruption , dose resumption ) epoetin alfa base hemoglobin ( Hb ) confirm prescribe information .</detailed_description>
