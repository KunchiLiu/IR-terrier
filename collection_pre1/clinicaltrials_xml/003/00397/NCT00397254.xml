	<detailed_description>A common clinical perception exist less effective treatment attack increase burden disease across attack form increase attack frequency , severity , duration , and/or treatability . If perception true , effective treatment decrease burden disease across attack . There multiple barrier effective treatment . The triptan class migraine medication frequently dispense context health benefit plan formulary limitation . Because limited supply , medication must use cautiously . Patients may hoard medication reaction fear run . Overly cautious use hoard may lead great disease burden .
