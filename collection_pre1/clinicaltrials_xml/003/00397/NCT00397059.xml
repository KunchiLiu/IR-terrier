	<brief_title>Pupillary Changes Potential Biomarker Escitalopram Relation CYP2C19 Polymorphism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Escitalopram , therapeutic active S-enantiomer citalopram , selective serotonine reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) use treatment depression anxiety disorder . The antidepressant effect probably due stimulation serotonergic neurotransmission cause inhibition presynaptic serotonin reuptake . This inhibition may also responsible increase pupil diameter see volunteer treat racemic citalopram . Based escitaloprams pharmacodynamic property expect affect pupil diameter . A dose/response relationship yet establish theoretically pupillary change might serve biomarker serotonergic effect escitalopram . Escitalopram demethylated part polymorphic cytochrome P450 enzyme 2C19 ( CYP2C19 ) ; impact CYP2C19 polymorphism total metabolism escitalopram still investigate . Objective : The aim study investigate pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics CYP2C19 extensive metabolizers ( EMs ) poor metabolizers ( PMs ) investigate whether change pupil size reaction light stimulus act biomarker serotonergic effect escitalopram . The study conduct randomize , double blind ; placebo control two phase cross-over trial single repeat dos 20 mg escitalopram equivalent placebo . Sixteen healthy volunteer ( 8 EMs 8 PMs ) participate trial . Prior trial , approximately 400 volunteer phenotyped omeprazole metabolic ratio order identify CYP2C19 EMs PMs . During two phase blood sample draw pupil size measure fixed time point drug administration .</detailed_description>
