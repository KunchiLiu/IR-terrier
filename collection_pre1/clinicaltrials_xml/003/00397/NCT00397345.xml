	<brief_title>TroVax Renal Immunotherapy Survival Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This international , randomise , double blind , placebo control , parallel group study investigate whether minimum three dos TroVax® add first-line standard care therapy , prolongs survival patient locally advance metastatic renal clear cell adenocarcinoma . The primary endpoint survival . The study design pragmatic , limit additional study related investigation minimum . Protocol mandate scan X-rays limit two time point ( baseline week 26 ) permit comparison percentage patient progressive disease 6 month secondary efficacy endpoint . Six month select base review publish literature indicate progressive disease commonly observe 26 week patient renal cancer . Endpoints tumour response RECIST consider secondary importance survival determine radiological examination order discretion investigator base clinical status patient base interpretation patient 's care-team ( investigator local radiologist ) . After sign study inform consent form meeting baseline enrolment criterion patient assign investigator ( physician ) one follow define first-line standard care regimen base best patient consistent local practice : 1. subcutaneous low dose IL-2 2. interferon-α ( exclude pegylated IFNα ) 3. sunitinib TroVax® administer dose 1E9TCID50/ml 1ml injection deltoid muscle upper arm regular interval 8 week apart maximum 13 dos .</detailed_description>
