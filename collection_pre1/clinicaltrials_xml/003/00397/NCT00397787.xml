	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer That Progressed After First-Line Therapy With Gemcitabine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate sunitinib malate patient previously treat metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration response , progression-free survival overall survival sunitinib malate patient previously treat metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . II . To determine safety sunitinib malate patient previously treat metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter , nonrandomized study . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study , patient follow every 3 month 2 year study entry disease progression .</detailed_description>
