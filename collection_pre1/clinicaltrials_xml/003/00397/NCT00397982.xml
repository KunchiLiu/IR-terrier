	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give temsirolimus together bevacizumab work treat patient stage III stage IV malignant melanoma . Temsirolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need growth . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth malignant melanoma block blood flow tumor . Giving temsirolimus together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective tumor response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient stage III IV melanoma treat temsirolimus bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe adverse event profile regimen patient . II . Determine efficacy regimen , term progression-free survival , patient . III . Compare pre- vs post-treatment measurement biomarkers vascular system/immune system parameter patient treat regimen . IV . Correlate tumor blood biomarkers clinical response patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 8 . Treatment repeat every 14 day maximum 26 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo tumor resection day 9 course 2.Blood sample collect course 1 2 . Samples examine flow cytometry evaluate peripheral blood mononuclear cell molecular effect study agent . Patients also undergo normal tumor tissue biopsy ( core needle biopsy , incisional biopsy , surgical resection ) course 1 2 . Samples examine immunohistochemistry , western blotting , protein array technology , gene expression analysis , DNA mutation analysis , genomic analysis pre-and post-treatment measurement target molecule ( epidermal growth factor receptor , B-Raf , MEK , MAPK ) , downstream pathway component ( PI-3 kinase , AKT , mTOR ) , marker angiogenesis , proliferation apoptosis , marker may modulate cell signal response investigational agent , vascular immune system parameter . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month , every 3 month 2 year , periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
