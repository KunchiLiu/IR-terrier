	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma remain among devastate cancer , especially recurrent GBM standard treatment establish date . ZK 219477 fully synthetic analogue Epothilone B , naturally occur cytotoxic substance . ZK 219477 inhibits microtubule depolymerization , cause cell cycle blockage G2/M phase induction apoptosis . This mechanism action similar taxanes ( paclitaxel docetaxel ) , epothilones retain activity multi-drug resistance ( MDR ) tumour . ZK 219477 demonstrated vitro vivo considerable anti-tumour activity wide range malignancy , enter phase II study number select indication . In pre-clinical model ZK 219477 demonstrate anti-tumorigenic activity glioma tumour vitro vivo . ZK 219477 ability cross blood-brain barrier , fundamental characteristic potential GBM chemotherapy . In preclinical PK study , similar concentration ZK 219477 detect plasma ( 1.2 μg/ml ) brain ( 0.9 μg/g ) 10 min i.v . application scid mouse . The AUC brain/AUC plasma 0.8 , indicate free access brain ( Hoffmann J et al . 2004 , European Journal Cancer Supplement 2 , N 8 , p. 159 , Abstract 521 , ref.17 ) . ZK 219477 produce strong antiproliferative activity human glioma cell line U373 inoculate subcutaneous nude mouse ( 2 mg/kg 9 mg/kg ) well paclitaxel ( 8 mg/kg ) , contrary paclitaxel , ZK 219477 demonstrate antitumour activity U373 implant nude mouse ( 9 mg/kg ) : 8 complete response 9 treated mouse . Of interest GBM indication , ZK 219477 metabolize liver cytochrome P450 , induce phenytoin anti-convulsion drug , commonly use post-surgery GBM patient . The purpose single arm phase II study evaluate safety efficacy ZK 219477 treatment pre-treated , recurrent GBM patient . Aim study : The purpose single arm phase II study evaluate safety efficacy ZK 219477 treatment pre-treated , recurrent GBM patient . An optional PK study perform select patient . Study Design : Open , monocentric , randomise , single arm , phase II study . Study medication : ZK 219477 epothilone B analog . Study Population : 15 recurrent glioblastoma patient previously treat surgery , conventional radiotherapy chemotherapy temozolomide ( TMZ . The 15 patient study , represent first stage recruitment accord statistical design . Inclusion Criteria : - Histologically proven ( diagnosis ) GBM - Age 18 70 year - KPS ≥ 70 - Life expectancy least 3 month - Presence least one bi-dimensionally measurable lesion gadolinium ( Gd ) -enhanced MRI , indicate progressive recurrent disease least 8 week standard external-beam radiotherapy - Recurrence progression treatment radiotherapy temozolomide . Also patient residual disease surgery recurrent GBM include - Adequate bone marrow reserve ( leukocytes ≥ 3,500/ml , ANC ≥ 1,500/ml , platelet ≥100,000/ ml ) ; normal baseline liver ( serum bilirubin ≤ 20 /mol/ L ) , renal ( serum creatinine &lt; 150 /mol/L ) cardiac function - Absence infectious disease , debilitate chronic disease , know psychiatric disorder - Corticosteroid dose stable least 1 week - Adequate recovery previous surgery , radiation chemotherapy - Negative pregnancy test enrolment females child-bearing potential - Agreement use highly effective contraception method adult reproductive potential - Fully inform write consent Exclusion Criteria : - Pregnant woman - Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week - History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ZK219477 - Uncontrolled inter current illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement - HIV-infection - Any prior treatment epothilones , tubulin-targetting taxanes ( e.g . paclitaxel , docetaxel ) vinca alkaloid ( e.g.vincristine , vinblastine , vinorelbine ) - Peripheral neuropathy - Any concurrent malignancy non-melanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix - Active infection - Breast-feeding - Subjects receive experimental drug participate clinical trial within 3 month prior screen - Employees investigator study centre direct involvement propose study study direction investigator study centre Treatments : Treatment administer inpatient basis . ZK 219477 administer i.v . infusion 3 hour duration dose 16 mg/m2 BSA every three week . Two dose reduction allow order manage toxicity : 12 mg/m2 9 mg/m2 . Evaluation criterion : Efficacy evaluation . Primary end-point : Progression Free Survival 6 month ( PFS-6 ) . Secondary end-points : Response rate ( CR +PR ) , Median Survival Time ( MST ) . Safety evaluation . Treatment toxicity assess use CTCAE , Version 3.0 , except neurological toxicity assess also mean Scottish Gynaecological Cancer Trials Group ( SGCTG ) Neurotoxicity Score electromyography . Statistics : A group-sequential design use chance remain alive free progression 6 month , call `` response '' , primary endpoint . The null hypothesis response rate ≤ 10 % test base binomial distribution response endpoint nominal significance level 0.10 ( one-sided ) . If observe response rate 15 patient &lt; 20 % , null hypothesis accept study failure conclude . If observe response rate ≥ 20 % ( i.e. , least three 15 patient show response 6 month ) , consideration would give study . If observe response rate amount least 5 initial 15 patient , null hypothesis reject study may stop first stage . Secondary end-points : PFS MST estimate use Kaplan-Meier method . Response , age , KPS , number surgical procedure perform , previous low grade , time end radiotherapy start chemotherapy consider variable possibly relate TTP time interval start chemotherapy death cause ( MST ) .
