	<brief_summary>This study investigate response immune cell ( neutrophil , monocyte ) various signal test tube determine sense signal body substance produce response . It determine cell may , certain circumstance , contribute inflammation , measure substance blood plasma ( liquid , non-cellular part blood ) might stimulate white blood cell , order understand blood respond possible disease-related condition . Healthy normal volunteer 18 year age old weigh least 110 pound may eligible study . Participants give 320 milliliter ( mL ) blood ( 1 1/3 cup ) less donation . They donate every 8 week six time year . On occasion , less 320 mL blood may draw . The collected blood separate component specific cell exposed substance examine response ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective define signal pathway activate lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) select innate immunity stimulus , downstream inflammatory functional consequence , human leukocytes vitro . Adult ( great equal 18 - 65 year old ) , nonpregnant , healthy volunteer 320 ml whole blood collect venipuncture monitor set frequently every 8 week . No intervention exercise upon subject . The whole blood fractionate neutrophil , red blood cell , mononuclear cell , plasma fraction use plasma-Percoll discontinuous centrifugation . Leukocytes subjected vitro inflammatory stimulus ( eg , LPS ) , select signal outcome ( eg , mitogen-activated protein kinase activation , Rho GTPase activation , protein-protein interaction ) functional measure ( eg , chemotaxis , superoxide anion cytokine production ) quantify absence presence relevant chemical inhibitor ( eg , SB203580 , p38 MAPK inhibitor ) . In experiment , cell daily donor use paired control vitro experimental intervention ( eg , SB203580 inhibitor vs. DMSO vehicle ) . Three repetition ( different donor ) specific experimental outcome , necessary , perform establish statistical significance finding . A specific focus study plan define role lipid raft membrane microdomains transduction LPS signal human leukocyte . Lipid rafts cholesterol-rich microdomains plasma membrane , within LPS receptor , Toll-like Receptor 4 ( TLR4 ) , describe reside . LPS signal report sensitive raft cholesterol content , presumably specific repertoire protein raft sensitive raft cholesterol content . Rafts think act dynamic signal platform co-segregation proximal adaptor protein , kinase , signal protein . Of interest , LPS describe modulate activity proteins determine raft cholesterol content ( eg , Liver X Receptor , ABCA1 ) , virtually work do clarify : 1 ) mechanism underlie LPS-induced intracellular cholesterol redistribution , , importantly , 2 ) whether intracellular redistribution cholesterol causal signal event trigger LPS , 3 ) whether innate immunity signal dependent upon inter-subject variation raft cholesterol content . Furthermore , investigate role tumor suppressor gene p53 regulation inflammation . It widely accept inflammation cancer development interconnect . Dr. Resnick one international leader study tumor suppressor gene p53 . His group discover activation p53 exposure carcinogenic stimulus lead differential expression gene direct effect inflammatory response , several toll-like-receptor gene . Dr. Resnick use human leukocyte isolate whole blood . He expose cell stimuli activate p53 , doxorubicin ( chemotherapy agent ) radiation , examine expression toll-like-receptor gene well response LPS inflammatory agent vitro . Finally , investigate role zinc-finger protein gene expression inflammatory cell . ZFP36 RNA bind zinc finger protein involve turnover mRNAs encode several clinical important cytokine , include TNF ( alpha ) . Several missense , promoter 3'-untranslated variant indentified human ; case , variant haplotype associate human inflammatory disease . We isolate peripheral blood macrophage stimulate LPS cytokine , evaluate behavior cytokine mRNA gene expression . In addition cell signal experiment , plan test novel detection system presence oxidize lipoprotein ( LDL ) blood . Inflammation body ( like sepsis , radiation injury , cancer ) induce generation reactive oxygen radical ( ROS ) react protein , DNA cell structure alter structure , therefore cause cell damage . No reliable minimally invasive test exist detect biomarkers oxidative stress human . One biomarker N-formyl kynurenine ( NFK ) find lipoprotein like LDL . We develop polyclonal antiserum NKF goal produce simplify high throughput method detect NFK via ELISA Western analysis . We propose purify LDL human serum standard method use ELISA analysis determine sample contain KFK detect use anti-NFK polyclonal serum . These experiment could lead development simple reliable non-invasive assay detects biomarker oxidative stress human .</detailed_description>
