	<brief_summary>The objective project develop test intervention promote exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) , assess impact infant health African context high prevalence HIV barrier , strengthen evidence base regard optimal duration EBF . Promotion EBF effective child health intervention currently feasible implementation population level low-income country . It low infant mortality 13 % , additional 2 % fact breastfeed transmits HIV . Only recently prove possible hot even dry climate , EBF without even offer water still little appreciated mother support health worker . EBF rate especially low Africa potential rapid implementation may high . A study elsewhere suggest peer counsel often achieve dramatic increase . Thus investigator run first randomise trial develop test model apply approach four African country quantify health benefit , cost-effectiveness , implication health care system . While expert realize HIV threat ought present much biological constraint promote EBF , heavily affected country represent cultural constraint . Overcoming require development safe effective mean promote EBF HIV-sensitive take account need minimise postnatal HIV transmission . Another scientific constraint promotion exclusive breastfeed six month , recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) , uncertainty impact micronutrient status infant . In substudy , investigator carefully follow marker infant micronutrient status see vary feeding pattern , include EBF , long period examine previously .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PROMISE EBF : Safety Efficacy Exclusive Breastfeeding Promotion Era HIV Sub-Saharan Africa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale The single effective way save life million young child develop country would promotion exclusive breastfeeding ( EBF ) . Over period 10 year could save life estimate 15 million child . `` Infants age 0-5 month breastfed seven-fold five-fold increased risk death diarrhoea pneumonia respectively , compare infant exclusively breastfed . At age , non-exclusive rather exclusive breastfeed result two-fold increased risk die diarrhoea pneumonia . '' Lancet 2003 ; 361 : 2226-34 This assertion , related comment finding , set Bellagio Child Survival Group recent article Lancet summarising finding international research best reduce infant mortality develop country , make despite limited knowledge best promote EBF . This proposal address urgent need tackle limitation . How best promote EBF need attention necessary secure high rate support EBF young mother , currently know best way bring , particularly cultural context Africa . Unless find effective strategy combat poor feeding practice health facility community setting , child mortality rate continue high . Breastfeeding The benefit breastfeed negative effect artificial feed underprivileged environment clearly bring public attention 1970s , back increasingly strong scientific support . As result International Code Marketing Breast-milk Substitutes subsequent World Health Assembly Resolutions create 1980s avoid marketing infant food , teat bottle way could interfere breastfeed . In early 1990s , UNICEF start `` Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative '' ( BFHI ) , decrease many practice health care system negative impact breastfeed . Together many child health programme decades intervention contribute reduction child morbidity mortality . Exclusive Breastfeeding - An Even Better Version Breastfeeding EBF mean infant receives nothing else breast milk , even water . That breastfed child need anything besides breast milk , even water , even hot climate , discover 1970s . A decade research confirm , follow attempt define breastfeed various pattern WHO . EBF traditional concept ; belief practice regard wide range early supplement common around world , often seem reflect belief express early physician . Nor widely understood health care professional , give lack information even paediatric basic training . So EBF able low child mortality 13 % , promote large scale already today ? Two major reason : fear HIV transmission breast milk uncertainty micronutrient status child exclusively breastfed 6 month . Breastfeeding Risk HIV Transmission When HIV-positive mother breastfeed 1.5 year , appear lead additional 15 % risk postnatal HIV transmission average . At population level epidemiological evidence exclusive breastfeeding still promote even country high prevalence HIV . For many HIV positive mother risk transmit HIV child outweigh risk infant die breastfed poor socioeconomic environmental condition live . Limited evidence suggest woman child EBF even important , minimise respiratory gastrointestinal infection also perhaps reduce risk HIV transmission . However reality HIV epidemic undermine breastfeed promotion effort especially country would benefit . In addition , expensive approach deal HIV remove focus breastfeed inexpensive way promote optimal child health . Intervention : Peer Counselling The constraint discuss meant effort promote EBF rudimentary far , consist mainly Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative . But Africa nearly effort come almost complete standstill recent year . EBF promotion therefore need reshaped era HIV . The challenge urgently put back track promotion exclusive breastfeeding benefit world 's child without lose credibility indiscriminately . PROMISE fine-tune test upgraded version EBF-promotion HIV-sensitive four African country high prevalence HIV need . In particular , first study deal explicitly constraint , open way widespread successful promotion EBF , especially Africa , ultimately give back Africa one powerful cheap intervention prevent child mortality morbidity . Peer counsel proven cost-effective approach change behaviour , example , prevent HIV infection . Several study also examine impact breastfeed behaviour . Based largely quasi-experimental study peer counsel show impact duration breastfeeding . Potential Impact This study provide first data randomise trial safety efficacy peer counsel way increase rate exclusive breastfeeding African context . Outcomes include morbidity , growth , micronutrient status . PROMISE EBF provide example world effort promote exclusive breastfeeding avoid postnatal HIV transmission do jointly , synergism may result . Methods employed cost document reported increase ease replication sustainability . In Africa , grow awareness strategy must identify tested lead high possible infant survival rate face risk postnatal HIV transmission . In 1997 UNAIDS , WHO UNICEF change policy HIV infant feeding , issue guideline implement new policy year later . Whereas previously country infant mortality due infection malnutrition advise promote breastfeed irrespective mother 's HIV status , new policy call individual counselling advantage disadvantage breastfeed vs. artificial feeding would enable mother make informed choice . UNICEF provide free formula number pilot site . Methodology Design A prospective , multi-center , community-randomised , control , experimental design use execute trial . Randomization A number 30 randomisation unit identify within reasonable distance study office . The randomisation unit vary sit typically 1-2 village average 1000 inhabitant ( 35 infant bear per year give birth rate 3 % ) . Before engage selection community , extensive information give community leader rest selection process do close collaboration community leader . Within district suitable community select group consider similar , base location , urban-rural , socioeconomic status stratify . Care take allow 'corridors ' select community randomise . In stratum half community randomise intervention reminder control community . Local community leader inform study . Each cluster visit checked size , collaborative administrative leader , share important facility ( water supply , market/shop/trading centre , primary school , mosque , church ) potential cluster . If urban rural cluster include less 30 % include . The complete list randomisable cluster check 24 cluster randomise site , applicable rural/urban stratum . The study carry four African country , Burkina Faso French-speaking West Africa , Uganda East Africa , Zambia Central Africa South Africa Southern Africa . In country one district select intervention site , Banfora South-west Burkina-Faso , Mbale District Eastern Uganda , Mazabuka Southern Province Zambia three site South Africa : Umlazi Durban , KwaZulu Natal , Rietvlei Eastern Cape Paarl Western Cape . Pregnant woman randomise community ( = cluster ) inform study ask willing participate . If agree , enrolment interview carry base eligibility criterion woman accept study . Sample Size Power Of primary outcome measure decrease diarrhoea difficult catch . We base sample size calculation expect reduction case diarrhoea ( age 3 month ) last two week one third 12 % 8 % . With 95 % confidence interval ( alpha error 0.05 ) power 80 % , average number infant 35 per randomise community , coefficient variation community 0.3 , need randomise 48 community arm - total 96 community . This include 420 infant arm country , total 840 child per country 3360 child study across four site . This sample size accurately give u increase EBF able document decrease diarrhoea morbidity . Recruitment Procedure The recruitment procedure adapt local circumstance . In common case , cluster recruiter ( `` pregnancy monitor '' ) mature woman good repute living within cluster . The pregnancy monitor inform research centre pregnant woman may eligible participate study . A data collector/research assistant send visit woman ascertain eligibility , obtain consent participate study conduct recruitment interview . In South Africa , recruitment woman do health facility antenatal clinic , data collector/research assistant interview woman ascertain eligibility , obtain consent participate study conduct recruitment interview .</detailed_description>
