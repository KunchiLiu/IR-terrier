	<brief_summary>This study intend help develop new MRI imaging technique study mood anxiety disorder . Researchers believe depression anxiety disorder may cause structural functional change brain . This study optimize way MRI scan collect look brain structure examine brain behaves subject perform particular task . Healthy normal subject 18 50 year age never major psychiatric disorder first-degree relative mood disorder may eligible study . Candidates screen phone question psychiatric medical history , current emotional state sleep pattern , family history psychiatric disorder . Candidates pass preliminary screening undergo additional screening interview laboratory test . Participants undergo magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) neuropsychological testing , follow : `` &lt; TAB &gt; MRI scan : Subjects ask participate MRI study one several scanner measure blood flow brain , concentration certain chemical brain , magnetic property brain . MRI use strong magnet radio wave obtain picture brain . The subject lie still narrow bed metal coil close head . For study , subject may ask wear special coil neck help measure blood flow . They may ask watch screen present image task respond picture sound may ask return additional scan . `` &lt; TAB &gt; Neuropsychological testing : Subjects may undergo test cognitive performance . Often , people mood disorder subtle change performance test allow researcher pinpoint brain abnormality occur . Before test use patient , must validate use healthy subject . These test present either orally , write form , computer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A major component understand pathogenesis mood anxiety disorder expect involve elucidation abnormality brain structure function associate condition . Historically , post-mortem histopathological neurochemical assessment constitute primary method investigate abnormality brain structure function psychiatric disorder . However , significance result study limit relatively poor availability specimens subject mood anxiety disorder unmedicated clinically well-characterized antemortem . By allow vivo human study , medical imaging technology afford efficient , accurate , non-invasive alternative characterize brain structure function . The recent , rapid development magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technology , particular , provide powerful tool assess wide range cerebral physiological morphological characteristic . To optimally exploit potential rapidly evolve MRI capability hardware investigation mood anxiety disorder , new technique application must test developed . The technical development protocol propose herein assess new image technique hardware , develop novel cognitive task application study mood anxiety disorder . The primary objective protocol development MRI experiment characterize physiological correlate mood anxiety disorder . In addition , pilot project encompass within protocol involve optimization exist MRI pulse sequence , application new pulse sequence structural functional MR imaging , development new functional MRI ( fMRI ) task elucidate neural function within cognitive-behavioral domain affect mood anxiety disorder . This protocol also allow test newly develop image hardware increase spatial resolution , contrast , sensitivity MR image . Such hardware include implementation new radio frequency ( RF ) coil patient monitoring equipment . Development technique application directly enhance sensitivity specificity MRI study mood anxiety disorder .</detailed_description>
