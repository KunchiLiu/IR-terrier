	<brief_title>AZD0530 Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Colon Cancer Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) 4 month metastatic colorectal carcinoma patient receive daily dos AZD0530 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate objective response rate ( RR ) overall survival ( OS ) patient metastatic colorectal cancer treat AZD0530 . II . In patient consent , blood tissue sample collect laboratory correlate . Assess preliminary manner association correlative marker potential downstream effect AZD0530 IL-8 , VEGF , specific Src-regulated marker focal adhesion , adherens junction , angiogenesis clinical outcome pre- post-treatment tumor sample . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral AZD0530 daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
