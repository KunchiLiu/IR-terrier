	<detailed_description>All subject undergo write informed consent screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation baseline cognitive evaluation use MMSE , ANAM computerize cognitive battery , test executive function . All subject evaluate United Parkinson Disease Rating Scales ( UPDRS ) follow overnight withdrawal anti-parkinson medication . Subjects ask undergo injection [ 123I ] 5-IA follow SPECT image describe . A second [ 123I ] 5-IA SPECT imaging study obtain reliability test 2 week 2 month follow initial [ 123I ] 5IA image session . The primary imaging outcome measure VT ' , equilibrium distribution volume brain region determine MRI-directed region-of-interest ( ROI ) analysis . The baseline image VT ' compare follow-up image study reliability nicotinic [ 123I ] 5-IA imaging .</detailed_description>
