	<brief_summary>Malformations heart ( congenital heart disease ) common congenital birth defect , occur 1 % child . Each year , 150-200 child undergo open heart surgery British Columbia Children 's Hospital ( BCCH ) repair defect ( ) heart . The abnormal structure heart open heart surgery may cause damage electrical system heart disturb rhythm heart ( arrhythmia ) , prolong recovery life-threatening . For reason , temporary pacing wire place heart follow surgery ensure heart rhythm normal possible post-operative period ( pace ) . In recent year , scientist recognize pace heart one area necessarily pace different area . In fact , individual arrhythmias poor heart function , pace heart different area improve pump heart , result well heart function . This form treatment call Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) endeavour optimize pump heart change electrical activation heart . CRT use limited extent child . A pediatric cardiologist use CRT help child heart failure . We would like determine whether pace heart different area open heart surgery improve child 's heart function aid recovery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Hemodynamic Benefits Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Children Following Open-Heart Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The heart 's rhythmic beating contraction determine flow excitatory electrical wave-front along specialized cardiac conduction system . In presence alter conduction , bundle branch block intra-ventricular conduction delay , abnormal cardiac contraction dyssynchrony occur . The delay occur specialize conduction system ( electrical dyssynchrony ) myocardium ( mechanical structural dyssynchrony ) .1 Techniques improve electrical mechanical synchrony patient bundle branch block initially do adult . Research field begin appear last decade dual chamber pace first use adjunctive therapy adult medically refractory heart failure.2 Acute study show atrioventricular ( AV ) synchronous pace short AV delay improve cardiac output exercise duration patient heart failure prolong PR interval.3 The beneficial effect AV resynchrony ( optimize AV conduction time pace ) show due increase diastolic filling time , reduction mitral tricuspid valve regurgitation . The result long-term study , however , demonstrate consistent improvement ejection fraction NYHA functional class DDD pacing.4 Since , Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) establish proven therapy congestive heart failure adult , patient show improvement exercise tolerance , quality life , survival.1 , 5 , 6 More recently , technique utilize CRT stimulate heart novel multiple site apply pediatric patients.7-9 Children chronic heart failure receive CRT successfully adjunctive therapy . One major limitation CRT objective assessment whether cardiac output ventricular function improve . As well , precise location pace heart order optimize hemodynamic function need determine . The objective assessment successful CRT difficult clinical issue ideally perform non-invasively . Traditional two-dimensional echocardiographic Doppler index use assess efficacy CRT include measure cardiac output , look ventricular ejection time , visually assess wall motion , measure length diastole use mitral `` E '' `` A '' wave . As exist technique limit assess global function , detailed method assessment necessary order fully assess optimize CRT.10 , 11 Tissue Doppler Imaging ( TDI ) offer detailed analysis regional cardiac function allow quantitative measure obtain . TDI operate high frame rate non-invasively map cardiac activation add information relate degree location cardiac dyssychrony . TDI derivatives allow : ( 1 ) measurement myocardial velocity , base detection Doppler shift cause motion myocardial tissue cardiac cycle ; ( 2 ) visualization tissue track , color-codes tissue segment similar displacement accord color map ; ( 3 ) measurement regional strain rate , describes rate deformation , quickly segment tissue shorten lengthen ; ( 4 ) measurement regional strain , describe deformation object ( case , tissue ) relative original state . 12 , 13 Cardiac pacing child do often follow cardiac surgery congenital heart disease ( CHD ) . This pace usually temporary . Following open heart surgery child frequently exhibit cardiac dyssynchrony secondary conduction abnormality regional wall motion abnormality . Often , damage conduction system unavoidable result operation . Regardless extent conduction abnormality , patient operate congenital heart disease undergo period decrease cardiac function relate several factor , include : pre-existing myocardial disease ; cardiopulmonary bypass ; residual cardiac lesions.7 , 14 The decrease cardiac performance , therefore , risk patient 's life , aggravate presence cardiac dyssynchrony . The benefit CRT begin receive attention set pediatric post-operative cardiac care . 15 We hope demonstrate CRT beneficial care post-operative patient undergo open-heart surgery repair congenital heart defect . We use state-of-the-art TDI assess cardiac dyssynchrony , use tool monitoring therapy . This study tremendous potential application patient undergo open-heart surgery repair congenital heart defect . If demonstrate CRT improve post-operative outcome population , significant morbidity mortality avoid , Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) hospital stay shorten , associate health care cost reduce .</detailed_description>
