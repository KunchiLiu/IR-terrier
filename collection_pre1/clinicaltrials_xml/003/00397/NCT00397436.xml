	<brief_summary>The main focus pilot study construct fairly complete protein profile epidermis . This allow u study epidermis responds external stressor ultra-violet . We hypothesize use cut edge technology , proteomics , able construct fairly complete profile different epidermal cell ( keratinocytes , epidermal nerve fiber ( ENFs ) , melanocytes , Langerhans cell , ... etc ) normal ultraviolet ( UV ) irradiate skin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Protein Profiling Human Epidermal Cells After Ultraviolet Irradiation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We investigate change epidermal cell proteome UV irradiation forearm healthy young male volunteer . Knowledge specific molecular marker may provide knowledge basic biological system possibly target therapy inflammation . By use combine proteomic methodology able quantify protein change cytoplasmic membrane protein level epidermal cell normal vs. irradiated skin . This study may allow u obtain fairly comprehensive profile membrane integrate cytoplasmic protein epidermal cell population facilitate understand biological response UV irradiation .</detailed_description>
