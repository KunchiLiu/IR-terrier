	<brief_summary>The study aim develop evaluate psychophysiological intervention distress chronic tinnitus . Therefore 100 people suffer chronic tinnitus randomly assign either intervention-group , receive 12 session psychophysiological orient intervention , waiting-list-group , wait comparable time period . Afterwards , patient waiting-list-group also receive intervention . The effect intervention severity , distress perceive loudness tinnitus well psychological variable like depression self-efficacy evaluate compare result intervention group waiting-list-group . Additionally psychophysiological reactivity different stress-conditions measure intervention wait . Therefore activity muscle head shoulder ( EMG ) well skin temperature skin conductance measure . It hypothesize patient strong psychophysiological reactivity benefit psychophysiological intervention .</brief_summary>

It hypothesize patient strong psychophysiological reactivity benefit psychophysiological intervention . Further aim study 1 ) compare muscle activity tinnitus-patients healthy control , till study investigate tinnitus-patients effectively present high muscle activity head shoulder healthy people 2 ) evaluate influence subjective illness perception intervention-outcome , hypothesized patient somatic illness perception benefit psychophysiological intervention patient rather psychological illness perception .</detailed_description>
