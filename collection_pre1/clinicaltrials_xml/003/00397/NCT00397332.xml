	<brief_summary>Alefacept ( AMEVIVEÂ® ) immunosuppressive dimeric fusion protein consist extracellular CD2-binding portion human leukocyte function antigen-3 ( LFA-3 ) link Fcof IgG1 . Alefacept produce recombinant DNA technology Chinese Hamster Ovary ( CHO ) mammalian cell expression system . It show interfere lymphocyte activation . Alefacept evaluate two randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study adult chronic plaque psoriasis . Each course consist once-weekly administration 12 week placebo alefacept . The response alefacept significantly good study . In study , onset response alefacept treatment ( define least 50 % reduction baseline Psoriasis Area Severity Index ( PASI ) ) begin 60 day start therapy . With one course therapy , median duration response ( defined maintenance 75 % great reduction PASI ) 3.5 month alefacept treated patient 1 month placebo-treated patient . Most patient respond either alefacept placebo maintain 50 % great reduction PASI 3-month observation period . Graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) ominous side effect allogenic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . It cause severe inflammatory process , usually locate skin , gut liver . Treatment GVHD consist various immuno-suppressive immuno-modulating drug , include steroid , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , methotrexate etc . These drug unfortunately also cause severe immunologic failure make patient prone infection malignancy , medication-specific side effect . In spite effect immune system , patient achieve control GVHD , usually rapidly lead death . Despite use innovative immunosuppressive modality , prognosis steroid resistant GVHD usually poor . In follow study evaluate effect alefacept steroid unresponsive cGVHD .</brief_summary>
