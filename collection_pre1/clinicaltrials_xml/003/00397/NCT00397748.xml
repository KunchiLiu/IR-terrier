	<brief_summary>This study explore brain men without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . It use positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study brain function nerve cell communication involve phospholipid ( fatty molecule make cover nerve cell fiber brain involve communication cell ) . It also look nerve cell communication relate blood flow . In particular , study explore communication dopamine system , one main neurotransmitter system brain involved ADHD . Healthy men men ADHD 18 55 year age may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : `` &lt; TAB &gt; Medical history psychiatric medical evaluation , include blood urine test . `` &lt; TAB &gt; MRI scan . This test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image brain . The subject lie still table slide scanner ( metal cylinder ) scanning . `` &lt; TAB &gt; PET scan . The subject lie scanner bed head held still use special facemask . A catheter ( plastic tube needle ) place artery collect blood sample vein inject radioactive isotope measure blood flow phospholipid metabolism . Scans do injection saline solution injection apomorphine , medication turn dopamine receptor brain . The injection give skin abdomen , one half hour apart ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A . Objective Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) heritable neurodevelopmental disorder report male predominance persists adulthood lead significant morbidity affect individual . ADHD currently hypothesize reflect central dopaminergic dysfunction . Evaluation human dopaminergic dysfunction use vivo neuroimaging limited study receptor localization quantification , dopamine synthesis , rather direct measurement functional status receptor signal . There exist need thoroughly elucidate mechanism underlie aberrant dopaminergic neurotransmission downstream receptor activation signal process . We develop vivo method measure neuroreceptor-initiated signal transduction involve activation phospholipase A ( 2 ) release second messenger , arachidonic acid ( AA ) . We propose use positron emission tomography ( PET ) quantitatively image dopamine-initiated signal transduction via AA ADHD patient healthy volunteer , subject administer dopaminergic agonist , apomorphine , measure regional cerebral blood flow ( rCBF ) well . We hypothesize signal flow response apomorphine elevate , demonstrate hypersensitivity dopamine signal mechanism . B . Study population 18 healthy male volunteer age 18 55 , recruit study ( see justification recruitment male Study Design Methods ) . C. Design All subject four study-related visit Clinical Center Bethesda one-year period , include overnight stay . Participants also ask complete initial comprehensive telephone questionnaire elicit whether meet criterion study participation , follow on-site visit NIH complete modify battery neuropsychiatric screening test related symptom presence severity . Questions relate medical , family , psychiatric developmental history lifestyle ask . In addition , visit include physical exam well blood urine collection , structural magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) head . Subject participation culminate sequential subcutaneous administration single dose control vehicle solution ( control ) follow dopamine agonist apomorphine ( appropriate pre-medication anti-emetic , trimethobenzamide ) two sequential injection vehicle PET scan attendant radiolabeled compound . D. Outcome Parameters This study four specific aim . First , regional cerebral blood flow quantify response acute challenge apomorphine s.c. compare study group ( ADHD/non-ADHD ) . Second , dopamine D ( 2 ) -like receptor signal transduction evaluate PET response acute challenge apomorphine s.c. compare study group ( ADHD/non-ADHD ) . Third , baseline esterify unesterified serum fatty acid compare patient control subject . Lastly , examine acute effect apomorphine stimulation serum growth hormone subject , confirmatory evidence stimulation central dopaminergic receptor .</detailed_description>
