	<detailed_description>The trial randomise , open , dose-selection , single centre trial . One adjuvant assess , aluminum hydroxide ( alum ) . Three different dosage - 10µg , 30µg , 100µg - GMZ2 evaluate aluminum hydroxide adjuvant . A total 30 volunteer enrol randomized three group 10 . As dose escalation study , volunteer Group 1 receive initial dose 10µg first vaccination day . After satisfactory safety profile dose ( see section 6.2.2 6.2.3 ) , proceed vaccinate volunteer Group 2 high dose 30µg 2-week interval . The procedure also follow volunteer Group 3 , administer initial dose 100µg GMZ2 review safety profile Group 2 satisfactory . The aim recruit volunteer intend start study . The randomization procedure perform following way : participant find eligible sign informed consent number sequentially ( order enrollment ) . The number randomly assign 3 group 10 number specific randomization computer program . These group treatment group .</detailed_description>
