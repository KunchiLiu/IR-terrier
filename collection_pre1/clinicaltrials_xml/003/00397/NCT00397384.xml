	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose erlotinib hydrochloride give together cetuximab see well work treat patient advanced gastrointestinal cancer , head neck cancer , non-small cell lung cancer , colorectal cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Erlotinib hydrochloride cetuximab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving erlotinib hydrochloride together cetuximab may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Cetuximab Treating Patients With Advanced Gastrointestinal Cancer , Head Neck Cancer , Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer , Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . II . To identify recommend dose ( RD ) phase II erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) combination cetuximab patient ( pt ) incurable gastrointestinal , head neck , non-small cell lung cancer Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog ( KRAS ) wild type . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To identify dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) . II . To perform skin tumor biopsy analyze molecular inhibition epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal pathway , define &gt; = 75 % inhibition phosphorylation epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) receptor downstream effector tumor protein ( p ) 44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) protein kinase B ( Akt ) &gt; = 25 % decrease marker proliferation Ki-67 ( Ki67 ) baseline either skin tumor tissue majority patient . III . To identify optimal biological dose ( OBD ) . IV . To describe antitumor effect observe . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study erlotinib hydrochloride . Patients receive cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 8-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
