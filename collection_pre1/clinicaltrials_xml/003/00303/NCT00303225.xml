	<brief_summary>This study test experimental antiviral drug call SIGA-246 use smallpox virus ( variola ) . Although smallpox universally eradicate , could possibly bring back bioweapon . In event smallpox attack , would best antiviral medication addition smallpox vaccine . SIGA-246 show activity virus family ( orthopoxvirus ) smallpox belongs . Healthy volunteer 18-50 year age pregnant breastfeeding may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram . Participants randomly assign receive one-time dose SIGA-246 ( either 500 mg , 1000 mg , 2000 mg ) placebo ( sugar pill ) take mouth . They report clinic morning follow procedure : - Insertion intravenous ( IV ) line forearm . - Blood urine test take study drug . - Drug administration within 30 minute eat light breakfast . - Blood sample IV line 30 minute 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 3.5 , 4 , 5 6 , 10 12 hour take SIGA-246 determine drug absorb , distribute , break excrete . Samples also collect needle stick 24 48 hour test . - Electrocardiogram 2 hour 24 hour take SIGA-246 . - 24-hour urine collection take SIGA-246 . - Complete diary card home 7 day take SIGA-246 . - Follow-up visit 2 week 4 week take SIGA-246 . - Checks health change problem every visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Historically , smallpox responsible hundred million death . In 1980 World Health Organization declare global eradication smallpox achieve surveillance vaccination program use live virus vaccine . In spite eradication , deliberate use smallpox bioterrorist agent remain threat . While effective vaccine , concern regard vaccine complication prevent universal vaccination absence disease exposure . In addition , event smallpox outbreak vaccination may ineffective immunocompromised individual expose virus 3 day prior vaccination . Antiviral therapy may able supplement vaccine , however , limitation currently available drug option . SIGA-246 oral medication show highly active variola virus demonstrate safety animal model . The primary objective study assess safety tolerability SIGA-246 various dos secondary objective evaluate pharmacokinetics drug . To achieve objective , 30 healthy volunteer enrol one three dose group ( 500 mg , 1000 mg , 2000 mg ) receive oral , single dose SIGA-246 placebo . In three ascend dose group 8 active drug recipient 2 placebo recipient . Safety study agent assess history , physical , laboratory evaluation . Pharmacokinetic endpoint include C ( max ) , T ( max ) , ( 1/2 ) , AUC , CI urinary excretion . Urine collect 3 8-hour interval serial blood sample obtain study agent administration .</detailed_description>
