	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Effect Botanical Dietary Supplements Inflammation Healthy People</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The impact nutrition lifestyle long recognize key determinant risk chronic degenerative disease atherosclerosis , osteoporosis , rheumatoid arthritis , etc . While clear reduce nutrition lifestyle risk factor particular disease reduces risk population , individual differ significantly degree presume beneficial change risk factor confer risk lack thereof . This individual response increasingly think due genetic difference . Developing parallel research genetic impact chronic disease risk strengthen body data suggest inflammation common many chronic degenerative disease . A key cytokine regulator inflammatory response , interleukin-1 ( IL-1 ) , emerge play particularly important role genetic level determine degree inflammation pathway turn . The strong influence IL-1 inflammation pathway follow functional role one initiate cytokine signal inflammatory pathway . Recent research identify polymorphisms IL-1 gene lead expression IL-1 elevate level inflammation biomarker , c-reactive protein ( CRP ) . Individuals select polymorphisms associate expression IL-1 appear increase risk select chronic degenerative disease . The mechanistic role IL-1 overall inflammatory response detrimental impact IL-1 over-expression may create need IL-1 genotype-directed nutritional , lifestyle dietary supplement intervention address individual genetic risk inflammation associate disease reduce chronic inflammation . The current protocol draw participant pre-existing database contain information health lifestyle , IL-1 genotype , inflammation biomarkers approximately 2300 people . The database create separate IRB-approved protocol . Participants randomly receive one three botanical formula placebo day 20 week . The effect botanical formula recognize marker inflammation , e.g. , CRP , well surrogate readout inflammation pathway , ex vivo IL-1 production , vivo expression IL-1 gene evaluate .</detailed_description>
