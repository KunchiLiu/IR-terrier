	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : A peripheral stem cell transplant may able replace blood-forming cell destroy chemotherapy radiation therapy , become cancer . Sometimes transplanted cell donor make immune response body 's normal cell . Giving cyclophosphamide fludarabine together total-body irradiation follow cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil transplant may stop happen . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well give combination chemotherapy together radiation therapy follow cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil work treat patient undergo donor stem cell transplant hematologic cancer , metastatic breast cancer , kidney cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine nonmyeloablative regimen comprise cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , radiotherapy follow cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil provide prompt durable donor engraftment patient hematologic malignancy kidney cancer undergo allogeneic stem cell transplantation . - Determine safety nonmyeloablative transplantation regimen patient . - Determine risk graft-versus-host-disease patient treated regimen . - Determine antineoplastic potency nonmyeloablative stem cell transplantation patient treat regimen . - Determine effect low dos daily fludarabine treatment-related mortality ( TRM ) OUTLINE : Patients stratify accord risk ( standard vs high ) . - Preparative regimen* : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day -6 fludarabine IV 1 hour day -6 -2 . Patients undergo total body irradiation day -1 . Some patient also receive anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) ** IV every 12 hour day -6 -4 . Patients receive ATG* include follow : - Related donor recipient receive combination chemotherapy within past 6 month - Unrelated donor recipient receive combination chemotherapy within past 3 month - Unrelated donor recipient receive 1 induction course treatment acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) , acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) NOTE : **Patients underwent prior autologous stem cell transplantation past year receive ATG . - Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation ( PBSCT ) : Patients undergo allogeneic PBSCT day 0 . - Graft-versus-host-disease prophylaxis : Patients receive cyclosporine IV 2 hour begin day -3 continue least day 100 . Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil IV orally twice daily day -3 30 . - Donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) : Patients without active GVHD deteriorate donor chimerism may receive DLI IV 2 hour . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 300 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Standard patient enrol Arms 16 . High risk patient ( transplant aplasia ) consider separately Arm 7 . Age Graft criterion ( patient ) Patient 's &lt; = 75 year old 5/6 6/6 related donor match eligible . Patient 's &lt; = 75 year 78/8 HLAA , B , C , DRB1 allele match unrelated volunteer marrow and/or peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) donor match eligible . Disease Criteria ( standard risk patient ) Acute myelogenous leukemia Acute lymphocytic leukemia Chronic myelogenous leukemia type except blast crisis ( note treat blast crisis chronic phase eligible ) . NonHodgkins lymphoma ( NHL ) , Hodgkins , chronic lymphocytic leukemia , multiple myeloma demonstrate chemosensitive disease Acquired bone marrow failure syndromes Myelodysplastic syndrome subtypes include refractory anemia ( RA ) IPSS category severe pancytopenia , transfusion requirement responsive therapy , high risk cytogenetics . Blasts must less 5 % . If &gt; 5 % require therapy ( induction Hypomethylating agent ) pretransplant decrease disease burden . Renal cell cancer , Chronic myeloproliferative disorder , i.e . myelofibrosis Disease Criteria ( High risk patient Arm 7 ) Patients refractory leukemia MDS may take transplant aplasia induction reinduction chemotherapy radiolabeled antibody . These high risk patient analyze separately Arm 7 . Adequate organ function performance status ( patient ) Pregnancy breast feed Evidence HIV infection know HIV positive serology Active serious infection Congenital bone marrow failure syndrome Previous irradiation precludes safe administration additional dose 200 cGy total body irradiation ( TBI ) Chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) refractory blast crisis Intermediate high grade NHL , mantle cell NHL , Hodgkins disease progressive salvage therapy . Stable disease acceptable move forward provide nonbulky . Multiple Myeloma progressive salvage chemotherapy . DONOR ELIGIBILITY Related undergo apheresis donor unable undergo apheresis , bone marrow harvest acceptable ; unrelated volunteer donor must able undergo bone marrow harvest apheresis . All donor must able give informed consent . Donors weigh less 40 kg ( child ) need evaluation pediatrician suitability apheresis procedure . Informed consent must obtain parent guardian applicable minor .</criteria>
