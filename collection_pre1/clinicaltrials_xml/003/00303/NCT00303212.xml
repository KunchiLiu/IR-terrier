	<brief_title>Tele-HF : Yale Heart Failure Telemonitoring Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) common , costly condition characterize recurrent period clinical decompensation often lead repeat hospitalization ( 1 , 2 ) . Despite advance care patient HF , population-based outcome mortality hospitalization rate improve substantially past decade ( 3 ) . Episodic , infrequent , outpatient visit usual opportunity clinician detect treat early sign HF decompensation ; constitute major gap current medical model . Moreover , opportunities patient take active role manage condition occur infrequently . Disease management emerge possible solution need good patient surveillance engagement . It typically involve multidisciplinary effort improve quality efficiency care patient chronic condition , intervention design foster adherence clinician scientific guideline patient treatment plan . However , traditional disease-management program generally resource-intensive ( often rely nurse case management ) , difficult scale large population , inefficient provide daily patient monitoring . Telemonitoring , bridge clinicians patient communication technology , hold promise close gap HF care ( 4 ) . This technology potential standardize , widespread implementation ( long-term maintenance ) near future easily apply large patient population integrate current medical care system . Supporting potential , preliminary evaluation suggest telemonitoring feasible across broad spectrum typical HF patient , relatively inexpensive per-patient basis , highly effective improve health outcome . Thus , approach ready rigorous evaluation . Accordingly , propose office-based , multicenter , randomize control trial ( Tele-HF study ) determine effectiveness telemonitoring strategy decrease hospital readmission death patient HF . Many HF patient experience deterioration health status increase weight symptom period day week ultimately present medical attention require hospitalization . Our premise frequent monitoring system alert clinician early sign symptom decompensation , provide opportunity intervention patient become severely ill require hospitalization . Moreover , system engage patient care provide instruction beneficial self-care strategy . This intervention intend substitute communication relate acute care acute , sudden change health status . In case , patient instruct make direct immediate contact doctor hospital . We use Pharos Tel-AssuranceTM , in-home communication system allow patient transmit information clinician provide education enable patient actively participate manage condition . The system use conventional telephone line require patient Internet access . Patients ask pre-programmed series question system automatically uploads response secure data center . A clinician practice log secure Internet site use Web browser review patient ' response . The system thus serve interface patient home clinician , facilitate monitor chronic condition patient education . While many vendor potential tool implement study , choose use Pharos Tel-AssuranceTM simple use , require equipment patient ' home substantial preliminary data suggest high patient clinician satisfaction use . The investigator financial interest company . Primary Aim Our primary aim determine whether telemonitoring community-based cardiology office practice reduce risk hospital readmission ( cause ) death initial `` index hospitalization '' HF . We hypothesize , among patient recently discharge hospitalization HF , telemonitoring decrease rate rehospitalization death 6 month least 15 % ( relative risk reduction ) . This would yield absolute risk reduction 7.5 % , 1 major adverse event would avert every 13 patient . We choose all-cause readmission part primary outcome poorly control HF result admission variety reason , patient becomes weak susceptible fall , mental status change , renal dysfunction , debilitate condition result hospitalization . In addition , societal health system perspective , overall risk readmission important disease-specific readmission . Moreover , prior study suggest telemonitoring reduce outcome . Secondary Aims In secondary aim determine whether telemonitoring : 1 . Reduce rate all-cause hospital readmission 2 . Reduce rate hospital readmission HF 3 . Reduce total number all-cause HF-specific hospital readmission 4 . Increase office visit clinician receive information telemonitoring system 5 . Improve survival index hospitalization 6 . Reduce cost inpatient medical care 7 . Improve health status 8 . Improve patient satisfaction care 9 . Improve patient ' self-management HF Sub-Group Analyses The following sub-group analysis conduct : 1 . Age 2 . Sex 3 . Race 4 . HFPEF v depress EF 5 . Education 6 . Insurance status 7 . Self-reported access care 8 . Baseline self-efficacy self-care 9 . Socioeconomic Status 10 . Site characteristic</detailed_description>
