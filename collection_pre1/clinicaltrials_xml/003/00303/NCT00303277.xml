	<detailed_description>Recent evidence suggest significant overlap AD cerebrovascular disease . In fact , AD cerebrovascular disease may share risk factor , include hypercholesterolemia . In addition , study suggest HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor lipid-lowering agent , know `` statin , '' decrease risk AD 70 % ; however , effect differ specific statin use . This study compare two statin , simvastatin ( cross blood brain barrier ) pravastatin ( ) , respect ability alter blood cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) level AD inflammatory marker . The primary aim propose study determine whether reduction Abeta statins whether lipophilicity statin affect ability decrease Abeta . In addition , proposal determine statin effect peripheral central inflammation whether lipophilicity statin affect ability decrease inflammation . If demonstrated statin alter AD-associated biomarkers , would broad implication treatment prevention AD . This study perform 60 cognitively normal middle-aged older person hypercholesterolemia ( total cholesterol &gt; 200 and/or LDL &gt; 130 ) , presumably person lipid-related increase risk AD alteration CSF Abeta interpreted.The differential effect two statin evaluate 12-week randomized treatment trial 30 subject group . Prior randomization follow 12 week treatment simvastatin pravastatin , subject undergo CSF blood collection . In CSF , concentration Abeta 1-40 , Abeta 1-42 , soluble APP , tau , 24S-hydroxycholesterol , apoE , total cholesterol , F2-isoprostanes , glucose , protein , cell count measure . In blood , concentration total cholesterol , HDL , LDL , triglyceride , phospholipid , fatty acid , 24S-hydroxycholesterol , apoE , apoB , apoA1 , Abeta 1-40 , Abeta 1-42 , F2-isoprostanes , C-reactive protein , fibrinogen , iron , homocysteine , albumin measure . Plasma simvastatin pravastatin concentration measure study completion . APOE genotyping perform .</detailed_description>
