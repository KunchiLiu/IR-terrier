	<brief_title>PXD101 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Aggressive B-Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate response rate patient relapse refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat PXD101 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity drug patient . II . Estimate 6-month progression-free survival rate patient treat drug . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine major histocompatability complex class II proteins ( HLA-DR , -DP , -DQ ) , TUNEL , CD8 infiltration status , immunochemistry pair pre- post-treatment tumor sample , first 20 patient enrol . II . Measure CIITA HLA-DR mRNA expression use quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction determine , preliminarily , association marker progression-free survival . III . Evaluate pair pre- post-treatment peripheral blood mononuclear cell patient histone acetylation status determine correlation finding duplicate experiment pre- post-needle core biopsy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive PXD101 IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Needle core biopsy peripheral blood mononuclear cell obtain first 20 patient pre- post-treatment biomarker correlative study . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
