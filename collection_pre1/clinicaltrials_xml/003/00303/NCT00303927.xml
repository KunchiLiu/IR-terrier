	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well capecitabine work second-line therapy treat patient stage IV pancreatic cancer thymidylate synthase gene .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Stage IV Pancreatic Cancer Who Have Thymidylate Synthase Gene</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Characterize 6-month survival patient stage IV pancreatic cancer ( progress least 1 prior gemcitabine-containing chemotherapy regimen ) carry double tandem repeat ( S/S ) variant thymidylate synthase ( TS ) gene enhancer region ( TSER ) treat capecitabine . - Characterize toxicity capecitabine patient stage IV pancreatic cancer carry S/S variant TSER . Secondary - Explore association capecitabine exposure steady-state , allelic variant candidate gene ( carboxylesterase 1 , carboxylesterase 2 , cytidine deaminase , thymidine phosphorylase [ TP ] , dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase [ DPD ] , methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase ) drug response ( toxicity efficacy ) patient population . - Determine relationship expression TS , TP , DPD tumor tissue response capecitabine patient population . - Analyze response rate capecitabine , base presence homozygous S/S variant TSER . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 65 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
