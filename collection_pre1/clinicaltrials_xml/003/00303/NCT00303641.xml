	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Medtronic Resting Heart Bypass system safer result less inflammatory reaction traditional bypass machine use coronary artery bypass surgery . We hypothesize new Medtronic Resting Heart System safer result much less systemic inflammatory reaction comparison standard cardiopulmonary bypass system currently use .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) play extremely crucial role coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) surgery past five decade . During CABG , CPB machine enable surgeon stop heart perform surgery bloodless operate field . The CPB machine essentially take job heart oxygenate blood perfuse entire body . In patient undergo CABG surgery CPB , systemic inflammatory reaction occur blood take body circulated CPB machine . This inflammatory reaction believe increase postoperative morbidity prolong hospital stay . The systemic inflammatory reaction result activation complement , coagulation , fibrinolytic kallikrein cascade , activate leukocyte endothelial cell cause expression adhesion molecules result release inflammatory mediator cytokine . This inflammatory reaction CPB lead vasodilation , increase interstitial fluid affect organ heart , lung , brain kidney result dysfunction ( ) . Elimination CPB patient undergo CABG surgery result reduction inflammatory response . Unfortunately , patient able undergo CABG without use CPB . Most conventional CPB system also use cardiotomy suction return blood collect operative field back CPB reservoir eventually return patient . This blood rich inflammatory mediator small particle activate surgical trauma protein line wound cavity . Returning blood back CPB circuit result circulation inflammatory mediator . Removal cardiotomy suction CPB system could potentially decrease inflammatory mediator reduce inflammatory response CPB . Recently , attempt decrease inflammatory reaction cause use CPB develop well , effective system . The Medtronic Resting Heart System similar conventional CPB system approve clinical use Canada United States . It potential advantage traditional bypass machine include ; 1 ) fully closed-to-air system allow air-blood interface could prevent blood activation , 2 ) cardiotomy suction therefore prevents air , lipid particulate emboli re-introduced patient 's circulation , 3 ) minimize hemodilution use small low-prime circuit , possibly decrease need postoperative blood transfusion , 4 ) CPB circuit , blood-contacting surface , coat Carmeda Bioactive Surface ( heparin bioactive surface ) , mimic critical characteristic vascular endothelium may prevent blood activation , 5 ) active venous air detector removal device ( VARD ) detect venous air automatically remove air may prevent blood activation . All elements potential benefit may reduce morbidity inflammation associate CABG surgery . Thus far knowledge , study look inflammatory reaction morbidity patient undergo CABG procedure use improved cardiopulmonary bypass machine . We therefore propose prospective , randomized trial safety effectiveness Medtronic Resting Heart system CABG surgery .</detailed_description>
