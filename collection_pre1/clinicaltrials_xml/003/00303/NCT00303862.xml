	<brief_title>AZD2171 Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient refractory metastatic renal cell carcinoma treat AZD2171 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety tolerability AZD2171 patient . II . Determine feasibility perform standardized delay contrast-enhancement-MRI correlative study across different institution platform data-sharing capability patient metastatic renal cell cancer . III . Generate preliminary data regard potential utility pharmacogenomic plasma/serum biomarkers angiogenesis predictive prognostic marker future investigation AZD2171 renal cell carcinoma . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily 4 week . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week .</detailed_description>
