	<detailed_description>This study seek answer three important question role ovine ( sheep-derived ) antivenom treatment people bite copperhead snake ( Agkistrodon contortrix ) : 1 . Although ovine antivenom approve FDA treatment copperhead envenomation , copperhead victim exclude previous clinical trial . Animal experiment retrospective human data suggest antivenom probably work copperhead snakebite , least short term . This study determine whether antivenom actually effective reduce pain , swell , immediate effect copperhead snakebite . 2 . Deaths copperhead snakebite extremely rare , survivor often report long term problem pain swell envenomated limb . No study formally measure long-term outcome untreated snakebite , whether antivenom benefit reduce duration severity complication . This study answer question formal assessment limb function 12 month treatment . 3 . After initial control sign symptom snakebite achieve antivenom therapy , patient develop recurrent swell blood clot problem . A randomized control trial rattlesnake victim show frequency problem reduce administration 6 additional vial antivenom 18 hour ( `` maintenance therapy '' ) . However , blood clot problem uncommon copperhead snakebite even without antivenom treatment , retrospective trial suggest maintenance therapy may effect frequency delay swell copperhead victim . In typical copperhead victim , maintenance therapy increase cost treatment 100 % . This study determine whether maintenance therapy necessary mild moderate copperhead snakebite . Patients eligible enrollment bitten snake positively identify copperhead within 6 hour enrollment , sign mild moderate severity envenomation , contraindication present . After appropriate informed consent , patient randomize receive : A. initial stabilize dose antivenom , follow maintenance therapy , B. initial stabilize dose antivenom follow placebo lieu maintenance therapy , C. placebo initial dose maintenance . All laboratory test , pain medication , hospitalization , therapy standard snakebite severity . If time envenomation becomes severe , antivenom administer . In addition standard assessment perform snakebite victim ( swell , pain , vital sign , blood clotting , complication therapy ) , patient study receive formal assessment function envenomated limb . This assessment use AMA disability rating system American Academy Orthopedic Surgeons ' Normative Outcomes Study questionnaire determine well limbs function well limbs perform much remain problem interfere patient ' long-term happiness ability perform common activity daily live .</detailed_description>
