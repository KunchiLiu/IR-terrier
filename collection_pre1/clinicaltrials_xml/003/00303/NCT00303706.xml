	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare safety effectiveness minimally invasive endoscopic harvest radial artery conventional open method radial artery harvest coronary artery bypass surgery . The researcher hypothesize radial artery safely , efficiently , routinely harvest use minimally invasive endoscopic technique . Endoscopic minimally invasive harvest radial artery reduce postoperative morbidity due pain , wound infection , neurological complication improve cosmetic result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Endoscopic Versus Open Harvest Radial Artery Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many surgical discipline quick adopt minimally invasive technique decrease complication shorter recovery times . As enter fifth decade coronary artery bypass graft surgery attempt make perform operation less invasively . Harvesting saphenous vein ( large superficial vein leg routinely use bypass surgery ) use telescope ( camera ) , show superior harvest vein large open incision . At institution , vein mention , routinely harvest use less invasive technique camera . This show result less infection . In early 1990 's , radial artery reintroduce bypass surgery increase number available alternative bypass graft . Long-term result radial artery ( 8-9 year ) show 88-91 % radial artery harvest remain open thereby allow flow blood . This significantly good 10-year rate saphenous vein 53-67 % . Therefore , radial artery become popular bypass graft . Conventionally , radial artery harvest make long vertical incision extend wrist elbow . The radial artery dissect direct vision within large open incision . Complications open harvest radial artery include infection , neurological complication , possible decrease blood flow hand , poor wound heal scar . Recently , development endoscopic harvest system , radial artery harvest use telescope ( camera ) small incision . Thus far , knowledge publish study compare conventional technique less invasive endoscopic technique harvest radial artery . Therefore , propose prospective randomize study determine radial artery routinely harvest use endoscopic minimally invasive technique . We wish compare conventional open technique minimally invasive technique determine difference postoperative complication , length hospital stay possible difference patient satisfaction cosmetic result ( scar ) two technique .</detailed_description>
