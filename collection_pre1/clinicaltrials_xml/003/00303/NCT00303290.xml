	<brief_title>PEG Interferon Alpha 2B Low-Dose Ara-C Early Chronic Phase CML</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If agree take part study , treatment , blood test every 1 4 week . After 10 year , blood test recommend 2 time per year . Bone marrow sample take every 3 month first year every 3 6 month . If study 10 year longer , bone marrow collection perform doctor think need . To collect bone marrow biopsy , area hip numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . During treatment , receive PEG-Intron week . You also receive Ara-C injection skin . You taught inject , family member friend teach give injection . Treatment give outpatient clinic MD Anderson clinic close . You receive treatment long help control disease . Treatment go 5 20 year . This investigational study . The FDA approve PEG-Intron research study . About 100 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients age 12 year old diagnosis Phpositive bcrpositive CML early chronic phase CML ( diagnosis &lt; 12 month ) . 2 . Serum bilirubin less 2mg % , serum creatinine le 2mg % , performance status 2 less Zubrod scale . 3 . Patients age 55 year HLA A , B , C , DR type perform sibling . Patients age 20 year patient late chronic phase , accelerate phase blastic phase offer allogeneic bone marrow transplantation match sibling first priority . 1 . Severe heart disease ( Class III , IV ) Psychiatric disability ( psychosis ) Pregnant lactate female 2 . Women pregnancy potential must practice birth control methods potential risk fetal teratogenecity agent . 3 . Patients must sign informed consent indicate aware investigational nature study , keep policy hospital . 4 . Definition CML Phases : . Early chronic phase : time diagnosis therapy &lt; 12 month Late chronic phase : time diagnosis therapy &gt; 12 month b. Blastic phase : presence 30 % blast peripheral blood bone marrow . c. Accelerated phase CML : presence follow feature : Peripheral marrow blast 15 % Peripheral marrow basophils 20 % Thrombocytopenia &lt; 100 x 109L unrelated therapy Documented extramedullary blastic disease outside liver spleen 5 . Continuation # 4 d. Clonal evolution define presence additional clone Ph chromosome part accelerate phase CML . Ph chromosome variant complex Ph chromosome translocation consider indicate disease acceleration . We recently find clonal evolution variable prognostic impact may suppress IFNA therapy ( 22,23 ) . Hence patient eligible therapy ( 22,23 ) . Hence patient eligible accelerated phase sign present .</criteria>
