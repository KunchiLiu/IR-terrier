	<detailed_description>There good evidence physiological arousal , associate sustained activation hypothalamic-pituitary axis sympathetic nervous system , underlie cause chronic insomnia . Accordingly , relaxation-related treatment address elevate cognitive somatic arousal effective insomnia . Previous study document effectiveness behavioral treatment reduce activation hypothalamic-pituitary axis sympathetic nervous system treatment specific medical disorder include insomnia . The aim proposal evaluate hypothesis improvement chronic psychophysiological insomnia follow behavioral treatment tightly associate reduction arousal hypothalamic-pituitary axis , measure plasma cortisol , sympathetic nervous system , measure urinary catecholamine . Objective measure sleep derive polysomnographic recording subject randomize 10-week active behavioral treatment placebo behavioral control treatment group . Continuous 24-hour evaluation cortisol catecholamine perform controlled laboratory condition treatment . We anticipate significant reduction cortisol catecholamine active treatment group compare control group . We also anticipate active treatment yield reduction related measure arousal include heart rate , autonomic arousal ( determined heart rate variability ) , body temperature . Given report evidence melatonin level chronically low insomnia anticipate increase sleep-related hormone melatonin yoga treatment group . If achieve , result provide novel demonstration reduction arousal behavioral insomnia treatment behaviorally enhance melatonin secretion control laboratory condition .</detailed_description>
