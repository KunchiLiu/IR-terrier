	<brief_summary>This study determine drug dutasteride improve weakness , mobility , functioning , nerve function , quality life patient spinal bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) . Patients inherited disease abnormal androgen receptor protein . The male hormone testosterone dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) bind abnormal receptor , cause damage nerve cell innervate muscle lead weakness . Dutasteride decrease DHT production . Lowering DHT level may decrease harmful effect DHT nerve improve strength people SBMA . Males 18 year age old SBMA neurological symptom walk 100 foot ( without assistive device ) may eligible study . Candidates screen blood test review medical record genetic study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Blood urine test , history physical examination , assessment muscle strength - Quality-of-life questionnaire - Tests assess functional ability , walk step , keep head lying , measure - Nerve conduction study motor unit number estimation ass nerve damage . A probe place skin delivers small electrical impulse wire tap skin record impulses . - Quantitative muscle test measure strength . The subject push pull lever attach gauge . Strength record computer . - Medication . Participants divide two group . One group give study drug , dutasteride ; receive placebo ( sugar pill ) . All participant take assigned medication day 24 month . - Follow-up evaluation . Every 6 month 2 year , participant return NIH repeat test describe determine effect dutasteride . Nerve quantitative muscle test do 6- 18-month visit . - In addition follow-up appointment NIH every 6 month , participant also blood test physical examination perform 3 , 9 , 15 21 month treatment patient 's local physician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dutasteride Treat Spinal Bulbar Muscular Atrophy ( SBMA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Spinal bulbar muscular atrophy ( SBMA ) Kennedy 's disease slowly progressive , X-linked motor neuron disease currently treatment . It cause mutation androgen receptor result polyglutamine repeat expansion . Recent animal study demonstrate decrease endogenous androgen level lead functional improvement increase survival . Studies also show high level 5 alpha-reductase , enzyme convert testosterone potent dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) , present ventral spinal cord , low level enzyme find within skeletal muscle . Thus , selectively decrease level DHT dutasteride , 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor , hypothesize selective protection motor neuron , without adverse effect reduce anabolic effect androgen muscle . Objective : This phase II , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial examine safety efficacy 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor dutasteride inhibit progression neurodegeneration patient Kennedy 's disease . Natural history data also obtain placebo control arm . Study Population : We aim enroll 50 men genetically confirm Kennedy 's disease . Design : Our objective examine safety efficacy dutasteride give dose 0.5 mg day 2 year outpatient setting . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial 25 subject arm . The subject evaluate neurologically endocrinologically every 6 month NIH Clinical Center . In addition clinical visit NIH , subject also examine primary physician 3 , 9 , 15 , 21 month treatment . The primary objective examine effect dutasteride inhibit reverse rate progression weakness measure quantitative muscle test . Following informed consent , patient undergo initial medical history physical follow test specific neurological endocrinological measure two-day outpatient visit . Patients provide blood sample analysis hormonal level extent muscle damage every three month . In addition , initial , one-year , two-year follow-up visit patient nerve conduction study well quantitative functional strength evaluation . Each patient randomize treatment placebo arm give 3 month supply study drug match placebo visit . In clinic visit , NIH clinical pharmacy send additional 3 month supply subject subsequent visit . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome measure use quantitative muscle test ( QMT ) . Secondary outcome measure include Adult Myositis Assessment Tool ( AMAT ) , 2-minute walk , quality life measure ( Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Version 2 , SF-36v2 ) , neurophysiological testing ( sensory nerve action potential , statistical motor unit number estimation ) . Changes hormone level ( testosterone , dihydrotestosterone , androstenedione , estradiol ) , creatine kinase level also measure correlate change strength . Evaluation disease severity course relate CAG repeat length androgen level also assess . Future Directions : The result phase II study assist u develop multi-center , double-blind , placebo-controlled phase III trial . In addition , natural history data obtain control arm important future clinical trial SBMA .</detailed_description>
