	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : The increasingly prolong extend use androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) treatment prostate cancer , usually achieve administration LHRH agonist , raise concern long-term toxicity , particular osteoporosis adverse metabolic change may associate type II diabetes increase cardiovascular risk . An alternative approach investigate method ADT . Oral oestrogen show effective LHRH surgical orchidectomy achieve castrate level testosterone equivalent improve prostate cancer outcome use routinely first-line therapy risk cardiovascular system ( CVS ) complication . The CVS complication attribute first-pass hepatic metabolism . Administering oestrogen parenterally avoid entero-hepatic circulation expect mitigate risk CVS toxicity whilst still effectively suppress testosterone castrate level . This hypothesis support result early stage trial provide sufficient indication safety efficacy patch warrant investigation treatment setting , recommend IDMC.. PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study well estrogen skin patch work compare luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist injection treat patient locally advance metastatic prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare progression-free survival overall survival patient locally advance metastatic prostate cancer treat transcutaneous estrogen patch vs luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogue . Secondary - Compare cardiovascular system-related morbidity mortality patient treat regimen - Compare activity treatment , term castrate level hormone , failure-free survival , biochemical failure , patient . - Compare toxicity , include osteoporosis , hot flush , gynecomastia , anemia , patient treat regimen . - Compare quality life patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm 1 ( control ) :1 ( patch ) ratio . - Arm I ( control ) : Patients receive luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonists per local practice absence unacceptable toxicity . - Arm II ( patch ) : Patients receive 4 transcutaneous estrogen patch , change twice weekly 4 week . Patients ' testosterone level measure week 4 . Patients whose testosterone level &gt; 1.7 nmol/L continue receive patch testosterone level measure every 2 week . Patients whose testosterone level &lt; 1.7 nmol/L week 4 point receive 3 transcutaneous estrogen patch change twice weekly absence unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline ; week 4 , 8 , 12 ; every 3 month 24 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 2200 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
