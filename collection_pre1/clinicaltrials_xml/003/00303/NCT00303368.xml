	<brief_summary>The study multicenter four-year outcome study natural history tibial dysplasia patient NF1 select patient without NF1 . We obtain information natural history , burden , functional health status , health-related quality life , surgical interventions/outcomes tibial dysplasia . The project also establish Core Facility ( NOCF ) tissue sample future study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The three specific aim study : - Specific Aim 1 - To assess health status health - relate quality life ( HRQL ) 50 child adolescent NF1 tibial dysplasia NF1 control . We hypothesize child adolescent NF1 tibial dysplasia experience additional burden morbidity due tibial dysplasia downward trajectory health status HRQL time . - Specific Aim 2 - To assess long term outcome current treatment 100 adult patient diagnose NF1 tibial dysplasia childhood . We hypothesize good quality life function , adult NF1 tibial dysplasia , associate amputation childhood compare multiple surgical procedure , lack fibular involvement , fracture later childhood . We also hypothesize individual NF1 tibial dysplasia high risk bony dysplasia high risk fracture bone . - Specific Aim 3 - To assess natural history short-term response therapy cohort least 60 child NF1 tibial dysplasia least 60 child tibial dysplasia presumably without NF1 prospectively diagnose course four-year study period . We hypothesize NF1 patient earlier presentation , Crawford Class II A-C , male gender , lack brace prior age two likely fracture . We also postulate individual without NF1 similar outcome response treatment . The result project provide rational basis future clinical therapeutic trial .</detailed_description>
