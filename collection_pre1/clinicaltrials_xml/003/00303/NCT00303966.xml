	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Relapsed Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient recurrent chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) treat sorafenib . II . Determine toxicity patient treat sorafenib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Correlate bone marrow angiogenesis , CLL tumor cell expression vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , VEGF receptor ( flt-1 , KDR , flt-4 neuropilin-1 ) , basic fibroblast growth factor , plasma interleukin-8 level response . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : Approximately 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
