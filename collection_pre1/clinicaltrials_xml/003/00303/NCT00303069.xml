	<brief_summary>This randomize , Multicenter , double-blind ( subject , investigator , Merck Research Laboratories ( MRL ) clinical personnel directly involve study ) , placebo-controlled , dose-ranging study healthy adult 18 55 year age . It first man ( FIM ) study evaluate tolerability immunogenicity 0657nI S. aureus vaccine . For Phase I study , approximately 120 healthy adult enrol study randomize receive single 0.5 mL vaccination either 0657nI S. aureus vaccine ( 3 different dosage level 5 μg , 30 μg 90 μg 0657nI vaccine ) saline placebo . Vaccine/placebo administer intramuscularly ( IM ) deltoid muscle . Because study first study evaluate tolerability immunogenicity 0657nI S. aureus vaccine human , dose-escalation phase conduct small number subject randomize 3:1 ratio ( n=36 , consist 9 subject 3 vaccine dosage level 9 placebo subject ) evaluate vaccine safety increase dose level 0657nI protein Panel A , expand enrollment remain 84 subject Panel B .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depending subject enrol study , follow complete : The subject receive single injection SAV placebo ( inactive substance ) deltoid muscle upper arm . The subject watch 30 minute vaccination monitor allergic reaction . The subject ask visit study doctor either 6 9 time 3-month study period . Once enrol , subject blood drawn receive vaccine ( baseline ) 7 time require visit . The blood use test and/or test subject 's body 's immune response SAV , see subject develop immunity S. aureus immunity continue 84 day . A Vaccination Report Card ( VRC ) provide participant . The participant ask record oral temperature reaction occur SAV injection site every day 5 day vaccination . The participant also ask record physical adverse effect may experience , include headache , nausea , muscle pain ache , fatigue every day 14 day vaccination . In additional medication ( include counter medication ) take 14 day post vaccination record VRC return research staff 14 day .</detailed_description>
