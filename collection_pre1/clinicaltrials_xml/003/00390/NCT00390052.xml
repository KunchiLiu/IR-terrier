	<brief_title>3-AP Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety , tolerability , toxicity oral 3-AP patient advance solid tumor . II . Determine maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose drug patient . III . Determine oral bioavailability pharmacokinetics drug . IV . Assess tumoral expression gene involve response resistance 3-AP . V. Observe record tumor response patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , dose-escalation study . Patients receive one time dose 3-AP IV 2 hour day -7 . Patients receive oral 3-AP twice daily day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos oral 3-AP maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis collect periodically 8 hour IV dose 3-AP first oral dose 3-AP course 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
