	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study fulvestrant lapatinib see well work compare fulvestrant placebo treat postmenopausal woman stage III stage IV breast cancer hormone receptor-positive . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use fulvestrant may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Lapatinib may stop growth breast cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether fulvestrant effective without lapatinib treat breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fulvestrant With Without Lapatinib Treating Postmenopausal Women With Stage III Stage IV Breast Cancer That Hormone Receptor-Positive</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare effect , term progression free survival , antiestrogen fulvestrant alone fulvestrant administer combination dual-kinase inhibitor lapatinib postmenopausal woman estrogen receptor ( ER ) and/or progesterone receptor ( PgR ) positive advanced breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare effect fulvestrant alone fulvestrant lapatinib clinical endpoint , include response rate , response stable disease rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] + stable disease &gt; = 6 month ) , duration response , overall survival , symptom checklist score , toxicity . II . To define predictive marker clinical activity among woman receive fulvestrant without lapatinib . III . To determine clinical benefit combination hormonal growth factor inhibitor therapy pronounce woman whose tumor express high level ER , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) , phosphorylated protein kinase B ( pAkt ) , and/or phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 ( pERK1/2 ) . IV . To serologically determine HER2 extracellular domain ( ECD ) EGFR ECD level identify patient great likelihood response clinical benefit fulvestrant without lapatinib . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 fulvestrant intramuscularly ( IM ) day 1 15 course 1 day 1 subsequent course . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD day 1-28 fulvestrant Arm I . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year annually 3 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologic , pathologic cytologic diagnosis cancer female breast either primary metastatic setting ; histological documentation metastatic/recurrent disease require unequivocal clinical evidence recurrence Stage IV breast cancer ( use American Joint Committee Cancer [ AJCC ] criterion , 6th edition ) , locally advanced ( stage III ) breast cancer consider amenable curative therapy Patients symptomatic brain metastasis symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases eligible study ; screen study require among asymptomatic patient ; patient previously treat brain metastasis , free symptom referable CNS disease &gt; 3 month treatment brain metastasis eligible Tumors ( determine pathology either primary metastatic site ) must potentially sensitive endocrine therapy , define express estrogen receptor ( ER ) and/or progesterone receptor ( PgR ) determine immunohistochemical method accord local institution 's standard protocol , &gt; = 1 % cell consider positive The protocol amend permit tumor HER2 status , though determination HER2 status must make ; patient consider eligible HER2 expression document one follow method : Immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) 0 ( i.e. , negative ) , 1+ , 2+ , 3+ level expression , Gene amplification ( fluorescent situ hybridization [ FISH ] ) positive negative Patients must least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt;

patient evaluable time progression , response Patients lesion , include small lesion ( long diameter &lt; 2.0 cm conventional technique &lt; 1.0 cm spiral CT scan ) truly nonmeasurable lesion include list eligible Lesions consider nonmeasurable include follow : Bone lesion ( woman bone lesion eligible describe ) Leptomeningeal disease Ascites Pleural/pericardial effusion Inflammatory breast cancer Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis Abdominal mass confirm followed imaging technique Cystic lesion Patients must one two prior endocrine treatment breast cancer either adjuvant metastatic setting , exclusive treatmentrelated amenorrhea ovarian suppression ; sequential use two different thirdgeneration aromatase inhibitor consider `` one '' treatment ; require tumor resistant treatment ; example : A patient de novo metastatic breast cancer never receive endocrine therapy eligible ;

A patient receive aromatase inhibitor adjuvant setting eligible , regardless whether receive tamoxifen point ; A patient receive adjuvant tamoxifen , subsequently nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor steroidal aromatase inhibitor advance breast cancer adjuvant metastatic setting eligible ; A patient receive adjuvant tamoxifen , nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor subsequently megesterol acetate advance breast cancer eligible Tumors potentially sensitive endocrine therapy , define &gt; = 3 month prior endocrine therapy without disease progression adjuvant metastatic setting Patients must prior treatment either adjuvant metastatic set commercially available thirdgeneration aromatase inhibitor ( i.e . anastrozole , exemestane , letrozole ) ; require tumor resistant therapy Patients may receive one prior chemotherapy regimen stage IV breast cancer ; prior chemotherapy adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant setting permit ; patient must finish chemotherapy least 1 week prior start protocol base treatment Patients may receive prior trastuzumab therapy stage IV breast cancer , combination one chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy regimen , must conclude least 3 week prior start protocolbased therapy ; prior trastuzumab therapy adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant setting permit , must conclude least 3 week prior start protocolbased therapy Prior therapy commercially available inhibitor EGFR ( include limit gefitinib , erlotinib , lapatinib cetuximab ) experimental inhibitor EGFR prohibit Patients may initiate bisphosphonate therapy prior study entry ; patient bone lesion consider evaluable progression response Prior fulvestrant therapy prohibit Patients receive gonadotropinreleasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist ovarian suppression must remain therapy throughout course protocol treatment ; patient must discontinue endocrine treatment , include systemic hormonereplacement therapy intravaginal estrogen prior study entry ; patient must conclude radiation therapy prior study entry ; patient must least 1 week prior chemotherapy 3 week prior trastuzumab therapy , adequate recovery bone marrow function performance status Patients must postmenopausal woman , define woman fulfil follow criterion : Age &gt;
