	<detailed_description>Pneumonia general CAP particular consider one common bacterial infection , associate high rate morbidity mortality . CAP highly significant economically since respiratory infection , pneumonia especially , cause 80 % antimicrobial use community . The high frequency respiratory infection excessive use antimicrobial major contributor development pathogen resistant antimicrobial . In addition , CAP almost patient treat empirically , without identification cause pathogen . CAP divide two principal group : Bacterial CAP Atypical CAP . Since pathogen different , treatment approach also different . The main obstacle absence adequate diagnostic immediate cheap tool enable identify pathogen hence treatment always appropriate . Giving right therapy right time major importance since early start correct treatment link morbidity mortality patient . For prescribe appropriate empiric therapy , know epidemiology CAP , i.e . frequent causing pathogen accord age group demographic characteristic , essential . Unfortunately , except one study conduct 10 year ago Dr. Liberman Soroka Medical Center , characteristic information regard causing pathogen . Lacking data , might result select inadequate treatment . Material &amp; Methods : We enroll 300 patient hospitalize Ha'Emek Medical Center diagnosis CAP , order make study result statistically significant . In addition demographic clinical data , follow test perform : 1 . Blood culture 2 . Sputum 3 . PCR - throat culture follow pathogen : - Mycoplasma pneumoniae - Chlamydia pneumoniae - Legionella - Adenovirus - Influenza A - Influenza B - RSV - Metapneumovirus - Parainfluenza - Pneumococcal antigen urine</detailed_description>
