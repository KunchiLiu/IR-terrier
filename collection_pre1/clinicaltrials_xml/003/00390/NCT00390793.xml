	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find intensive chemotherapy combine dasatinib , follow maintenance therapy , help control ALL Ph chromosome and/or BCR-ABL . The safety treatment also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hyper-CVAD Plus Dasatinib Philadelphia/BCR-ABL Positive Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The intensive chemotherapy use study include combination 7 chemotherapy drug . These drug include cyclophosphamide , vincristine , Adriamycin ( doxorubicin ) , dexamethasone , methotrexate , cytarabine ( Ara-C ) , dasatinib possibly rituximab . The maintenance therapy use study include combination 3 chemotherapy drug . These drug include vincristine , prednisone , dasatinib . Ara-C design insert DNA ( genetic material cell ) stop DNA repairing . Cyclophosphamide design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Dasatinib design block protein cancer may need grow , survive , spread . Dexamethasone , doxorubicin , methotrexate , prednisone design stop slow growth cancer cell , may cause cell die . Vincristine design interfere multiplication cancer cell , may slow stop growth spread throughout body . This may cause cancer cell die . Rituximab design attach lymphoma cell , may cause die . If find eligible take part study , receive intensive chemotherapy therapy dasatinib follow maintenance therapy . You receive 2 kind intensive chemotherapy regimen ( hyper-CVAD therapy methotrexate plus cytarabine ) alternate every 3 week total 8 cycle ( 4 course regimen ) . You routine blood draw ( 1 tablespoon time ) different time point throughout study . You blood drawn Course 1 ( twice weekly ) ; remainder 7 course ( week ) ; maintenance phase ( every 4-6 week ) . You bone marrow biopsy perform different time point throughout study . You bone marrow biopsy see treatment control disease , Course 1 Days 14 21 , well whenever study doctor think necessary see Ph chromosome and/or BCR-ABL still present . Intensive Chemotherapy : You may receive 8 cycle intensive chemotherapy hospital ( 4 5 day ) . For participant 60 year old , receive entire first course hospital ( 21 day ) , protect environment , healthy recovery blood count . Hyper-CVAD therapy give odd-numbered course ( 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 ) . You receive cyclophosphamide vein Days 1-3 , give every 12 hour total 6 dos . While receive cyclophosphamide , also receive MESNA central venous catheter ( CVC ) , give 24 hour 12 hour last dose cyclophosphamide . This drug use help protect bladder side effect ( irritation bleed bladder ) cyclophosphamide . A CVC sterile flexible tube place large vein local anesthesia . Your doctor explain procedure detail , require sign separate consent form procedure . You receive vincristine vein Days 4 11 , give 30 minute cycle hyper-CVAD therapy . You receive doxorubicin Day 4 large vein CVC 24-48 hour last dose cyclophosphamide . This depend heart function drug give long period time . You receive dexamethasone Days 1-4 Days 11-14 mouth vein 30 minute cycle hyper-CVAD therapy . Methotrexate plus Ara-C give even-numbered course ( 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) . You receive methotrexate Day 1 vein 24 hour . You receive Ara-Con Days 2 3 cycle , give vein 2 hour every 12 hour total 4 dos time . Your dose Ara-C may decrease depend age , kidney function , certain side effect may experience . You receive citrovorum leucovorin completion methotrexate , help decrease side effect ( mouth sore kidney damage ) methotrexate . You also receive growth factor ( G-CSF ) completion cycle Hyper-CVAD methotrexate plus cytarabine . You receive G-CSF injection skin every day healthy recovery white blood cell , determine study doctor . If doctor think need , Days 1 11 Cycles 1-4 , also receive rituximab vein several hour . You also receive small dos methotrexate Ara-C spinal tap help prevent relapse disease fluid surround brain . A spinal tap require insertion needle skin soft tissue low back reach pocket fluid part fluid space surround brain spinal cord . Once fluid space reach , sample fluid collect . The procedure do local anesthesia . It also use give chemotherapy . You may give treatment methotrexate Ara-C , alternately , brain spinal tap cycle total 6-8 dos . The number dose receive depend many dos study doctor think necessary . If start leukemia brain , give 2 time week leukemia present 1 time week 4 week . Occasionally , sample fluid obtain spinal tap may examine sensitive test presence leukemia . A sample also send determine amount dasatinib see reach fluid around brain . Dasatinib give mouth Days 1-14 Cycle 1 every day Cycles 2-8 . If disease respond therapy experience intolerable side effect , continue intensive chemotherapy 8 course , proceed maintenance therapy phase . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . Maintenance Therapy : Maintenance therapy , last 2 year , give complete 8 course intensive chemotherapy . You receive vincristine Day 1 vein every 28 day . You receive prednisone Days 1-5 mouth every 28 day . You receive dasatinib every day mouth 2 time day . During Months 6 13 , may receive another course hyper-CVAD , depend feel presence disease . You also receive rituximab month doctor think need . Your dos chemotherapy give study may increase decreased depend organ function side effect . Throughout intensive chemotherapy maintenance therapy , also receive drug , fluid , blood product ( antibiotic , antiemetic , antacid , saline , platelet , plasma ) , include allopurinol ( mouth ) rasburicase ( vein ) , help protect body tumor lysis syndrome . This condition bring death large tumor , cause damage kidney . This investigational study . All drug use study FDA approve commercially available . Their use together study investigational . Up 115 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
