	<brief_title>Safety Study MultiGeneAngio Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 16 million patient worldwide ( 1 20 people age 50 ) suffer peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) . PAD characterize narrow occlusion vessel supply blood low limb , often due atherosclerosis . Symptoms PAD include claudication may progress critical limb ischemia manifest rest pain , tissue loss gangrene , eventually may necessitate amputation . MultiGeneAngio cell therapy-based product develop treatment patient PAD secondary narrow block artery legs . MultiGeneAngio compose endothelial smooth muscle cell isolate short vein segment strip patient 's arm . After isolation cell expand , characterize , gene modify transfer angiogenic gene . MultiGeneAngio clear cell suspension inject intra-arterially site blockage use standard diagnostic catheter , order create expand new collateral artery , thereby improve blood flow ischemic limb . Comprehensive pre-clinical study , well clinical experience PAD patient suffer claudication show production administration MultiGeneAngio feasible safe , apparent drug-related adverse event observe . Moreover , follow-up data peak walk time imply beneficial trend efficacy end-point . Additional follow-up data continue collect help evaluate safety efficacy MultiGeneAngio .</detailed_description>
