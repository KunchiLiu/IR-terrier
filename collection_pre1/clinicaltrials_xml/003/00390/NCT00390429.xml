	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving docetaxel together erlotinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose erlotinib give together docetaxel treat patient solid tumor see well work treat patient advance non-small cell lung cancer . ( Phase I portion study treat patient solid tumor complete 12/01/2004 )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety feasibility two different schedule erlotinib hydrochloride docetaxel patient advance solid tumor . ( Phase I [ complete 12/01/2004 ] ) - Determine response rate patient advance non-small cell lung cancer treat second-line docetaxel erlotinib hydrochloride . ( Phase II ) Secondary - Compare toxicity two different schedule erlotinib hydrochloride docetaxel patient . ( Phase I [ complete 12/01/2004 ] ) - Determine maximum tolerate dose two different schedule erlotinib hydrochloride docetaxel . ( Phase I [ complete 12/01/2004 ] ) - Assess overall survival progression-free survival . ( Phase II ) - Determine frequency severity toxicity associate treatment regimen . ( Phase II ) Tertiary - Perform laboratory correlative study patient tissue blood sample investigate potential predictor response . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study erlotinib hydrochloride ( phase I complete 12/01/2004 ) follow phase II , open-label study . - Phase I ( complete 12/01/2004 ) : Patients assign alternate fashion 1 2 treatment group . - Group I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 oral erlotinib hydrochloride day 2 , 9 , 16 . - Group II : Patients receive docetaxel group I oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 2-16 . In group , treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Patients may continue receive erlotinib hydrochloride alone absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . In group , cohort 3-6 patient receive escalate dos erlotinib hydrochloride maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . - Phase II : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 oral erlotinib hydrochloride MTD determine group II phase I daily day 2-16 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients may continue receive erlotinib hydrochloride alone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample , buccal mucosal cell , tumor tissue obtain treatment . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) expression polymorphism p27 protein expression assess immunohistochemistry . Immunofluorescence ( laser-scanning cytometry ) use detect EGFR p27 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 87 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For phase II portion patient must cytologically histologically proven NSCLC . ( Completed 12/1/04 For phase I portion study patient must cytologically histologically proven advanced solid tumor standard therapy curative intent ) . For phase II portion patient must disease progressed recur treatment platinum base therapy . Patients stable disease front line platinum base therapy also eligible . No 1 previous treatment metastatic disease allow phase II portion . ( Completed 12/1/04 Any number prior chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease allow phase I portion ) . Patients must measurable disease RECIST criterion . Disease previously irradiate site consider measurable clear disease progression follow radiation therapy . ( Completed 12/1/04 Patients evaluable disease may include phase I portion trial . Patients must 18 year age old . Patients must performance status 01 phase II portion trial . ( Completed 12/1/04 performance status 02 allow phase I portion study Patients must estimate survival least 3 month . Any prior chemotherapy patient receive complete least 4 week prior start OSI774/Docetaxel . For prior mitomycin chemotherapy 6week interval require . Prior radiation must complete least 2 week prior start therapy . All side effect must resolve prior start OSI774/Docetaxel . Patients must adequate renal function document serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl calculate creatinine clearance &gt; 50 ml/min ( see appendix formula calculate creatinine clearance ) . Patients must adequate liver function document serum bilirubin &lt; ULN . AST must &lt; 2.5 x institutional upper limit normal . Patients must pretreatment granulocyte count &gt; 1500/mm3 platelet count &gt; 100 000/mm3 . Patients asymptomatic treat brain metastasis ( surgical resection radiotherapy ) may include neurologically stable steroid anticonvulsant least 4 week . Because possibility treatment related neurological toxicity difficult evaluate toxicity presence symptomatic brain metastasis . All patient must give write informed consent . Able take retain oral medication . Patients reproductive potential must agree use effective contraceptive method treatment 3 month afterwards effect drug unborn fetus unknown . Patients Coumadin INR monitor least per week frequently depend investigator judgment . There case report increase INR Coumadin coadministered OSI774/placebo . May previously receive docetaxel ; OSI774 prior EGFR target therapy . Females pregnant breastfeeding effect drug unborn fetus unknown . Documentation negative pregnancy test require woman reproductive potential . Patients symptomatic brain metastasis still require steroid may include . Clinically significant ophthalmologic abnormality exclude . This include severe dry eye syndrome , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , Sjogren 's syndrome , severe exposure keratopathy , disorder might increase risk corneal epithelial injury . A history severe hypersensitivity reaction docetaxel drug formulate polysorbate 80 . Preexisting neuropathy &gt; grade 2 may participate No prior malignancy allow phase II portion except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , adequately treated stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient diseasefree five year .</criteria>
