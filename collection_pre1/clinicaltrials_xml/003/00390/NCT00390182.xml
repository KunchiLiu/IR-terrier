	<detailed_description>Before enter study doctor examine patient order blood test . These test use approximately 10 ml blood . Blood work do within 3 week prior treatment.. Women child-bearing potential require pregnancy test do within 7 day prior start treatment . A CT PET/CT scan chest , abdomen pelvis do within 4 week prior start treatment . All subject participate study receive radiation therapy chemotherapy . Patients get 4 cycle chemotherapy along radiation . Each cycle chemotherapy consist gemcitabine give i.v . day 1 day 8 treatment . XRT give day 1 2 day 8 9 twice day . This work 8 treatment XRT per course chemo . Overall , total 32 treatment radiation therapy give 4 session chemotherapy . Blood work CBC differential platelet do prior dose chemotherapy.The investigational portion study radiation therapy give abdomen day day patient receive chemotherapy . Three-Four week treatment completion patient evaluate . The treat physician examine patient order blood test . These test use approximately 10 ml blood . The physician also order repeat CT PET/CT compare disease status treatment . These test experimental part routine check-ups patient pancreatic cancer . Patients follow survival .
