	<brief_summary>The Ventricular septal defect ( VSD ) common congenital cardiac malformation . By modify Nit-Occlud® PDA Device Nit-Occlud® Lê VSD Spiral System design . percutaneous , transcatheter device occlusion ( peri ) membranous muscular ventricular septum defect ( VSD ) spiral coil . In clinical investigation feasibility , safety performance new cardiac occluder evaluate accordance European US regulation . The study data compare performance criterion VSD , deduce analogue publish specific Objective Performance Criteria ( OPCs ) PDAs . The first part study perform three clinical centre Germany . For second part April 2009 four additional clinical centre Germany , Israel , Italy Spain include .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>VSD must diagnose acknowledge method , like echocardiography Signs leave ventricular volume overload present ( left ventricle leave atrium diameter 2 standard deviation great normal ) and/or measure catheterisation : Qp/Qs &gt; 1.5 Pulmonary vascular resistance le 4 Wood unit The patient old 24 month The VSD perimembranous muscular location . A distance rim VSD aortic annulus least 3.0 mm ( measure 2D echocardiography apical 5chamber view ) The minimal diameter ( size ) VSD le 8.0 mm ( measure 2D echocardiography apical 5chamber view ) Patient must agree fully participate clinical trial give inform consent write . If patient without legal ability additionally person legal responsibility must agree s/he must give informed consent write Pathological physical condition preclude implantation NitOcclud® Lê VSD coil , : perimembranous VSD evidence circular aneurysm formation Associated cardiac anomaly require surgery ( great mild aortic insufficiency ; aortic valve prolapse ) Active endocarditis type sepsis active infection time implantation Thrombus near intend site implantation Thrombus vessel access VSD gain ( unless patient protect embolic protection device vena cava filter ) Vessels access VSD gain accommodate 7 F sheath Potential steric ( 3dimensional ) interference occluder intracardiac intravascular structure ( like valve ) History blood disorder ( coagulopathy , tendency towards haemolysis ) History hypersensitivity contrast medium Nitinol AVblock II° III° , atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter End stage cardiac disease , irreversible major organ failure , terminal cancer HIV infection Cerebrovascular disease neurological deterioration Emergency cardiologic intervention Patient* ) able fully participate study include followup ( e.g . mental geographical reason , patient intravenous drug user strong potential noncompliance medical regime ) Patient , respectively person legal responsibility , mentally unable understand nature , aim , possible consequence clinical investigation Pregnant breastfeed woman Patient participate another clinical investigation last 3 month Patient person responsibility revoke consent .</criteria>
