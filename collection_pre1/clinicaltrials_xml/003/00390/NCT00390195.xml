	<brief_summary>The mTOR examine hepatocellular carcinoma well . This pathway up-regulated proportion hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) rapamycin inhibits cell proliferation block S6K phosphorylation . Inhibition mTOR show suppress substantially liver tumor growth . Nevertheless , inhibition mTOR demonstrate clinical response cancer type . These report imply inhibition mTOR could promise therapeutic strategy treatment HCC . Therefore , hypothesize RAD001 , rapamycin analog , inhibit mTOR , subsequently suppress liver tumor treatment HCC patient . This study aim investigate safety , efficacy , pharmacokinetics , pharmacogenetics feasibility RAD001 advance HCC patient . This study randomize phase I study dose escalation subsequently phase II study intent treat , well pharmacokinetic , pharmacogenetic surrogate marker study RAD001 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Phase I/II RAD001 Advanced Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives： 1 . Primary Objectives - Phase I : To assess maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) daily weekly oral RAD001 patient advance HCC Child-Pugh 's class A B - Phase II : To assess disease control rate advance Child-Pugh 's class A B HCC patient receive determined MTD daily weekly oral RAD001 phase I 2 . Secondary Objectives - Phase I : To investigate follow item advance HCC patient receive RAD001 1 . Dose-limiting toxicity 2 . Pharmacokinetics study 3 . Pharmacogenetic study 4 . Surrogate marker study PTEN , total Phosphorylated form Akt tumor tissue 5 . Disease control rate - Phase II : To investigate follow item advance HCC patient receive RAD001 1 . Overall survival 2 . Toxicity profile 3 . Pharmacogenetic study 4 . Surrogate marker study PTEN , total Phosphorylated form Akt tumor tissue Study Design : This study randomize phase I study dose escalation subsequently phase II study intent treat , well pharmacokinetic , pharmacogenetic surrogate marker study RAD001 . Sample Size : Upto 134 patient ( Phase I : cohort 3-6 test dose level upto 48 patient reach expect MTD , 24 patient schedule treatment arm ; Phase II : 18 patient schedule first stage 25 patient schedule second stage ) . Study Medication : The RAD001 dose level daily schedule escalate 2.5 , 5.0 , 7.5 10 mg/day without splitting , without food . The RAD001 dose level weekly schedule escalate 20 , 30 , 50 70 mg/week without split . The dose schedule RAD001 phase II study dependent result phase I study . RAD001 supply Novartis Co. , Study Conduct : Patients enrol onto sequence receive oral dose RAD001 . The schedule RAD001 either daily weekly . Throughout whole phase I II study , eligible patient randomize either arm daily weekly schedule . In phase I part , cohort dose level 3 patient . The dose oral RAD001 initially fix 2.5 gm/day daily schedule arm 20 mg/week weekly schedule arm . One treatment course define 4 week RAD001 therapy . When patient experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) certain level , subsequent patient would randomize next dose level . When 1 3 patient develop DLT , 3 additional patient would treat dose level . Three patient recruit next dose level none 3 additional patient experience DLT . No intra-individual dose-escalation performed . In phase II part , Simon 's optimal two-stage approach use daily weekly schedule . If one responder observe first stage eighteen patient either treatment schedule , twenty-five patient accrue . Therapeutic Assessment： 1 . Efficacy assessment : - Radiological response : To evaluate disease control rate ( complete response + partial response + stable disease ) compute tomography every 8 week therapy accord RECIST guideline . - Biological response 1 . To evaluate change serum a-fetoprotein level . 2 . To evaluate change plasma angiogenic factor level . 2 . Safety Assessment : Toxicity assessment : - Evaluation toxicity perform patient-base . - Clinical laboratory toxicity/symptomatology grade accord NCI common toxicity criterion ( CTC ) version 3.0 . - Abnormal liver functional test common patient HCC , abnormal elevation ALT consider indicator hepatotoxicity . 3 . Pharmacokinetic , Pharmacogenetic &amp; Surrogate Marker Assessments - Pharmacokinetic assessment : 1 . Cmax : peak concentration 2. tmax : time achieve peak concentration 3 . Cmin : trough concentration 4 . Cave : average concentration 5 . AUCt : area curve within give time 6. t1/2 : elimination half life - Pharmacogenetic assessment : 1 . Polymorphic CYP3A4 2 . Polymorphic CYP3A5 3 . Polymorphic P-glycoprotein - Surrogate marker assessment : 1 . PTEN 2 . Total Phosphorylated form Akt Procedures : 1 . Screening do within 2 week start treatment , include parameter list , ( except pharmacokinetics , AEs/concomitant medication , toxicity assessment ) well informed consent , patient eligibility , medical history , pregnancy test ( indicate ) , EKG , urinalysis . 2 . During treatment : - Physical examination ( include vital sign measurement ) , height , weight , AEs , toxicity evaluation first day week initial 4 week , biweekly subsequently 8 week 4-weekly thereafter . - Performance status assess first day treatment course . - Investigators/research nurse monitor patient treatment course instruct patient regard sign symptom RAD001 toxicity describe `` Information Patients '' section RAD001 product labeling . - The laboratory test , hemogram , clinical chemistry conduct weekly first 4 week , biweekly subsequent 8 week 4- weekly thereafter . - Imaging study tumor response perform every 2 course . - Patient clinical biological response note end study . Statistical Analysis : No formal inferential statistical analysis perform . Data summarize use descriptive statistic ( number patient , mean , median , standard deviation , minimum , maximum ) continuous variable use frequency percentage discrete variable . For safety analysis , data present patient . An accounting study patient disposition tabulate . Demographic data ( e.g. , age , gender ) , medical history , cancer history , baseline characteristic summarize . 1 . Safety Evaluation : The general safety tolerability RAD001 assess use follow safety endpoint : AEs , routine clinical laboratory evaluation ( hemogram , serum chemistry , urinalysis ) , physical examination , concomitant medication , Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status . The grade AEs time rescue determine NCI-CTC version 3.0 . 2 . Pharmacokinetic Analysis : Pharmacokinetic parameter determine plasma drug metabolite concentration curve use non- compartmental approach . Mean ( SD ) plasma drug concentration value summarize plot dose group . All parameter describe summarized mean standard deviation . The concentration plasma determine sampling time point furnish original scale subject participate study . The pharmacokinetic parameter Cmax , Cmin , Cave , AUC analyze logarithmic scale measurement . The parameter elimination half- life tmax analyze original scale . 3 . Efficacy Analysis : The efficacious parameter determine mean disease control rate median time tumor progression ( TTP ) overall survival ( OS ) use Kaplan-Meier method . The efficacious parameter add 95 % confidence interval . All calculation base intent-to-treat principle .</detailed_description>
