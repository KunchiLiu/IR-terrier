	<brief_title>Out-of-Hospital CPAP Severe Cardiogenic Pulmonary Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiogenic pulmonary edema ( CPE ) frequent present process acute out-of-hospital practice . Acute leave heart failure may occur variety process rapidly deteriorate generalized cardiopulmonary disorder . The classical treatment out-of-hospital CPE include supplemental oxygen , vasodilator , loop diuretic , morphine . If effective , associated respiratory depression , tracheal intubation mechanical ventilation often need , , associate bad prognosis . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) propose alternative mechanical ventilation CPE . This technique improve alveolar recruitment decrease work breathe 4 also reduce leave ventricular afterload , right leave ventricular preload . The overall effect CPAP acute management CPE improve cardio-respiratory function sustain tissue oxygenation . Furthermore , combination CPAP medical treatment patient CPE significantly reduce need intubation improve outcome . Unfortunately , limit data available effect CPAP out-of-hospital practice . Thus , test potential benefit immediate use CPAP alone comparison pharmacological therapy treatment CPE acute out-of-hospital environment . The protocol last 45 minute , divide 3 period 15 minute . Patients severe pulmonary edema randomly assign 2 group : 1/ “ Early CPAP ” ( n=63 ) : CPAP alone ( T0-T15 ) ; CPAP + medical treatment ( T15-T30 ) ; medical treatment alone ( T30-T45 ) ; 2/ “ Late CPAP ” ( n=61 ) : medical treatment alone ( T0-T15 ) ; medical treatment + CPAP ( T15-T30 ) ; medical treatment alone ( T30-T45 ) . Primary endpoint : effect early CPAP dyspnea clinical score arterial blood gas . Secondary endpoint : incidence tracheal intubation , inotropic support , in-hospital mortality .</detailed_description>
