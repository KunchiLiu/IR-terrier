	<brief_summary>We systematic functional assessment non-melanoma skin cancer include precancerous lesion OCT image diagnostic method . The systematic assessment comparison clinical diagnosis , histopathology , OCT image , spectrophotometry high frequency ultrasound non-melanoma skin cancer Functional exploration non-melanoma skin cancer do Doppler-OCT polarization-sensitive-OCT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigate Diagnostic Value Possibilities OCT Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Optimal management skin malignancy rely early accurate diagnosis . The reference standard skin cancer biopsy histopathological assessment clinical suspicious skin lesion . The clinical diagnosis skin cancer sensitivity range 50 % 90 % specificity around 70 % 80 % depend population study experience clinician . A rapid , non-invasive technique could use characterization skin lesion prior biopsy would valuable . In patient multiple , recurrent skin tumour need numerous biopsy area problematic , cosmetically diagnostically , cancer hidden scar tissue . The biopsy several weakness : The biopsy must do exactly tumour , delineate tumour border . Biopsy skin general easy , problematic place T-zone face , eyelids ear . Notably place area type skin cancer exhibit aggressive , invasive growth high recurrence rate . OCT novel , non-invasive optical imaging technology . It provide cross-sectional tomographic image tissue pathology situ real time , without need excision processing specimen , conventional histopathology . OCT use harmless , infrared light create high-resolution image tissue . OCT provide cross-sectional image structure tissue surface analogy histopathology . Hence OCT function “ optical biopsy ” providing image tissue structure micron scale . For example , OCT could use standard excisional biopsy hazardous impossible , OCT could reduce sample error associate excisional biopsy .</detailed_description>
