	<detailed_description>Background Literature Review The Spread Early Demographic Impact HIV Zimbabwe High level HIV prevalence incidence record Zimbabwe since sentinel surveillance introduce 1990 . Prevalence level excess 40 % record among woman attend antenatal clinic number urban centre [ 1,2 ] . In cohort study male factory worker conduct Harare 1993 1995 , 19 % participant find infection enrolment incidence rate 2.93 % per annum record [ 3 ] . However , rural area - 70 % country 's population base - experience high rate incidence current time . In Mberengwa , Midland Province , HIV prevalence among pregnant woman increase 8 % 1992 25 % 1994 [ 4 ] . In study two rural area Manicaland Province , also find high level HIV infection antenatal clinic 1993-94 - 24 % 14 % , growth point Honde Valley Rusitu Valley , respectively . Further data Honde Valley 1996 indicate incidence remain high ( 2-4 % ) . Significant increase adult infant mortality orphanhood record . The cause-specific age-patterns increase indicate due primarily HIV infection . Sexual intercourse casual partner common condom use low . In qualitative study , high proportion men , relatively woman , report recent casual partnership . Mathematical model simulation indicate pattern behaviour could explain great excess mortality record among male , give recent - last 4-5 year - escalation HIV epidemic rural area . Other ulcerative non-ulcerative sexually transmit disease ( STDs ) common , 2 % respondent aware STDs facilitate HIV transmission [ 5 8 ] . Mathematical model projection , base understanding predominant behaviour pattern fit observed trend HIV prevalence , also indicate increase adult early childhood mortality expect . Results simulation empirical finding Uganda suggest increase result adverse indirect effect , include high proportion child experience orphanhood distortion age- sex-distribution population [ 9,10 ] . These effect may compound fertility change . Birth rate decline rural area Zimbabwe present HIV epidemic may re-enforce decline change behaviour underlie fecundity [ 11 ] . Women HIV infection report low fertility woman Ugandan study [ 12 ] result research Manicaland indicate behaviour change would tend re-enforce exist decline birth rate may begin occur [ 7 ] . HIV Prevention Strategies Mathematical model simulation demonstrate potential reduce incidence new HIV infection biomedical behavioural intervention . The benefit early intervention target intervention core group emphasize [ 13,14 ] . Targeted intervention liable less effective introduce high level HIV prevalence reach . Their success also depend level heterogeneity sexual activity exists within population predominant pattern mix different risk group [ 15 ] . Combinations intervention approach act additively even synergistically [ 16 ] . In one set simulation , base epidemiological data rural Uganda , demonstrate combined biomedical behavioural intervention ( ) increase condom use contact men casual sex partner 50 % , ( b ) reduce frequency contact 50 % , ( c ) reduce average duration STD episodes 50 % , could reduce HIV incidence 50 % first year 80 % ten year . Empirical study show change nature possible lead large reduction HIV incidence . In Nairobi , health education condom promotion lead increase condom use among commercial sex worker 8 % 66 % . Condom use associate 3-fold reduction risk sero-conversion [ 17 ] . In Zimbabwe , large-scale condom promotion programmes associate 48 % 53 % reduction STD case three year , Bulawayo Mutare , respectively . Most reduction achieve within first year intervention [ 18 ] . In study 752 male factory worker Mwanza , Tanzania , counsel STD clinic contribute significant reduction report high-risk behaviour - eg : proportion one sexual partner precede month fell 22 % 12 % - large ( 63 % ) - non-significant - reduction HIV incidence [ 19,20 ] . In randomized control trial rural area around Mwanza , improved diagnosis treatment STDs associate 42 % reduction incidence new HIV infection two-year period [ 21,22 ] . While example demonstrate effectiveness individual intervention , remain shortage scientific evaluation combine approach programme sustainable within rural community , majority sub-Saharan African population base HIV spread rapidly [ 23 ] . Studies kind essential establish effectiveness different intervention strategy provide demonstration model use promote implementation intervention appropriate cost-effective . Care Support Interventions As HIV epidemic begin cause high morbidity , mortality , orphanhood socio-economic hardship , affected community require intervention provide support cop problem , particularly , institution-based solution become less viable . This need often upper-most people 's mind , prevention programme link care initiatives - especially infect community member support involved prevention - consider likely effective [ 24 ] . Few systematic evaluation conduct assess effectiveness exist care support model . However , clear programme include high level external biomedical input unlikely financially sustainable [ 25 ] . On hand , early evaluation indicate initiative encourage local community ownership participation , whilst limit scope , extremely cost-effective [ 26 ] . Community-Based , HIV Prevention , Care Support Intervention Strategy Rural Zimbabwe In light , propose initiate community-based , combine HIV prevention , care support intervention Honde Valley neighbour area Mutasa District rural Manicaland . The propose intervention ultimately cover area approximately 2,750 square kilometre , comprise population around 170,000 people . The project collaborative programme promote Family AIDS Caring Trust ( FACT ) Biomedical Research Training Institute ( BRTI ) involve local community church group local Ministry Health personnel . FACT Zimbabwean NGO base Mutare , provincial capital Manicaland , well-deserved reputation organization pioneer innovative community-based HIV control activity Zimbabwe . Its ' establish project include prevention support programme urban rural area province . FACT responsible behavioural ( include condom promotion distribution activity community-based promotion STD service ) , support care aspects programme . BRTI relatively recently-formed organization base Harare strong link University Zimbabwe Medical School , Blair Research Institute part Ministry Health Child Welfare . BRTI considerable expertise STD diagnostic method treatment regime would responsible aspect intervention evaluation , close co-operation Ministry Health Manicaland . It serve similar function establish HIV control program elsewhere Zimbabwe . BRTI would also act employer staff engage carry fieldwork intervention evaluation . PLAN International recently extend area operation Zimbabwe include Honde Valley agree provide fund HIV intervention programme minimum period four year . PLAN maintain routine record number key impact indicator project sponsor assess . It may possible develop system provide information indicator impact HIV epidemic effectiveness AIDS control activity - eg : programme coverage success target - could use study long-term monitoring purpose . The propose intervention strategy appear good potential sustainability replication . Factors support view include emphasis local community involvement , low cost external input , well-established local NGO partner , Ministry Health support , presence rural-based , community-orientated funding organization substantial international funding base long-term commitment extend scope activity Zimbabwe . Descriptions principal intervention element contain separate document attach proposal . Objectives Study The principal objective study follow : 1 . To scientifically evaluate impact cost-effectiveness combined behavioural STD-control intervention strategy slow spread HIV infection rural Zimbabwe ; 2 . To extend recent monitoring demographic impact HIV epidemic rural area Zimbabwe . Subsidiary aim include validation innovative method data collection HIV , STDs - ie : use saliva sample [ 35 ] - sexual behaviour rural setting ( subject final pre-test pilot study ) estimate HIV incidence cross-sectional prevalence data [ 27 ] ; evaluation antenatal clinic data source information HIV level within general population ; development method routine evaluation community-owned support programme individual family affect heightened experience chronic morbidity mortality . Methodology Experimental Design Intervention Trial Six pair sub-communities ( cluster ) , match similar level key factor affect spread HIV , identify vicinity Honde Valley . Four pair likely within commercial estate - tea , coffee , forestry orchard - two communal farm area . Each sub-community choose include health clinic improve STD service make available . The behaviour STD-control intervention introduce one cluster within pair phased basis period twelve month - ie : one new cluster every two month . In case , baseline survey evaluation conduct intervention comparison cluster two-month period immediately prior introduction programme . For evaluation , 1,000 respondent enrol within sector sub-community follow initial household census - half enrol men age 17-49 year half woman age 15-39 year . Individuals usually reside household eligible full participation study - i.e . : recruitment de jure basis - order increase follow-up reduce within-group heterogeneity . Within household , random selection process use avoid instance husband wife one wife enrol thereby reduce correlation outcome within individual cluster . Respondents pair cluster survey two year month baseline visit . Records keep anonymous basis mechanism put place enable data link within survey round . Outcome indicator include knowledge HIV AIDS , sexual behaviour indicator - partner acquisition partnership duration , mix pattern condom use - incidence HIV select STD infection , health-seeking behaviour indicator . Sample size calculate give 80 % power 95 % significance level , compare match intervention comparison cluster , range different outcome variable . The formula use calculation take account possible between-cluster - case prevalence - within-cluster variability [ 22,28 ] . Given level spatial mobility exists within Honde Valley area , diffusion effect likely present . This reflected sample size computation use conservative anticipated excess reduction intervention cluster . We estimate sample size 1,000 individual per cluster yield minimum 700 observation , account loss follow-up . In case HIV incidence calculation , observation provide 1,120 susceptible person-years observation , allow baseline prevalence general adult population 20 % . Under condition , initial sample size 1,000 per cluster sufficient permit detection 40 % excess reduction HIV incidence , give baseline annual incidence 2 % high . This sample size also enable u detect , inter alia , 40 % low incidence new HSV2 trichomoniasis case among individual infect baseline 40 % reduction report casual relationship without use condom , give baseline prevalence 10 % . Evidence model simulation empirical study suggest excess reduction HIV incidence require plausible give combine intervention strategy [ 19,29 ] . Furthermore , require excess reduction STDs high-risk behaviour attainable . Reductions factor , order indicate , would , demonstrate , represent strong indirect evidence intervention strategy slow spread HIV infection . Reduction STDs would significant benefit , , give morbidity adverse fertility consequence frequently cause . Data Collection : Quantitative Qualitative Methods Quantitative data collect intervention trial outcome measure summarize , principally two-round survey . A cohort participant survey recruit household census within twelve study area . The second round study conduct two year first visit area involve repeat household census detail interview original participant . The population-based survey also provide data process indicator , include measure contact intervention programme - eg : number meeting attend visit receive programme personnel - utilization programme service - eg : free condom , revolve loan , care support , STD diagnosis treatment - potential determinant key outcome , include socio-economic demographic factor , personal experience HIV-related morbidity mortality . Data collect demographic indicator - eg : age- gender-specific mortality , recent fertility , orphanhood household composition - household individual interview , use standard demographic method [ 30,31 ] . Quantitative data also collect HIV prevalence antenatal clinic , representativeness data source evaluate . Qualitative data sexual health-seeking behaviour obstacle behaviour change collect focus-group discussion , pocket-chart voting session key-informant interview [ 32,33 ] employ aid questionnaire design validation interpretation statistical result . These method use successfully previous study [ 7 ] . However , strengthen aspect current proposal , additional input design implementation appropriate ethnographic method receive collaborator LSE ( Dr. Campbell ) . Steps take develop good work relationship already form Honde Valley community , mobilize community support research provide reassurance information give treat strictly confidential . Thus , hope achieve high participation follow-up rate reliable information . Preliminary meeting hold community leader explain purpose study research procedure . Similar information give prospective participant prior decision enrolment . Data collection method self-completion questionnaire - 96 % 45 % woman age 50 year , live Honde Valley , receive primary secondary education , respectively , literacy level among men high woman [ 7 ] - secret balloting , avoid need participant reveal personal information enumerator directly thus reduce under-reporting sensitive information [ 34 ] , field-tested pre-tested pilot study use feasible . Similarly , possibility use less invasive medium saliva , urine blood spot sample HIV STD test investigate Public Health Laboratory Harare [ 35 ] . The reliability acceptability method apply rural setting also field-tested pilot study . Questionnaires translate local Manyika dialect Shona , back-translated pre-tested pilot study . Data entry validation undertaken use SPSS-PC+ . Appropriate data entry form design section survey questionnaires skip-rules , range check etc employ reduce data entry error . BRTI/Blair staff considerable experience use SPSS-PC+ data entry . Data Analysis : Scope Methods Reliability validity check conduct assess quality quantitative data [ 36 ] . Data analysis conduct use statistical software - eg : STATA SAS - mathematical model HIV incidence , base underlying biomedical , behavioural demographic determinant HIV infection [ 37,38 ] . Statistical analysis include test significance difference arise paired intervention control cluster [ 39,40 ] test impact contact intervention programme possible determinant change report behaviour . The impact HIV epidemic mortality monitor use longitudinal survey data official vital registration record . Impact fertility assess compare birth rate among infected uninfected individual , control key determinant include age , education , religion history STDs . Crude birth rate , crude death rate level natural population increase estimate survey data trend evaluate [ 12 ] . Coverage impact care/support intervention investigate . HIV prevalence estimate population-based survey compare estimate woman attend antenatal clinic assess representativeness latter . Adjustments make data analysis matched-pair design study . Data study use evaluate new method estimate incidence cross-sectional HIV prevalence survey [ 27 ] . Ethical Considerations Informed consent seek condition enrolment study . This write form wherever literacy level allow - expect great majority case . A write statement local dialect shona provide explain purpose study aspect , benefit risk participation . The statement make clear participant right withdraw study time . Time allow prospective participant read statement , ask question consider decision . The statement read aloud prospective participant unable read . Enumerators train balanced manner avoid possible coercion . Participants give opportunity receive HIV-1 test result . Preliminary counselling offer study interview . Where participant indicate would like advised HIV-1 serostatus , appointment arrange visit local clinic free counsel test service make available . Standard Ministry Health Child Welfare WHO procedures follow throughout , serological test undertaken require . Participants test positive sexually transmit disease advise result free treatment service offer wherever possible ( eg : trichomoniasis ) . Less invasive medium urine saliva use collection sample HIV-1 STD testing . Where blood sample seek , blood spot rather venipuncture use . Appropriately qualified trained personnel employ collect sample . Rigorous procedure maintain throughout study ensure full confidentiality information obtain participant . Data protection anonymization procedure implement computerized matching method use ensure access link data strictly limit principal investigator , single exception appropriate medical staff give access result HIV-1 STD test participant wish inform result offer treatment . The procedure staff , study participant individual able deduce individual HIV-1 , STD sexual behaviour detail apply exclusion inclusion criterion . Confidential voting method employ collection sexual behaviour information avoid need participant impart personal information enumerator . Benefits participant include participation prevention , care support activity intervention area ( see separate description intervention activity ) . Subject confirmation activity effective , researcher programme manager commit ensure similar programme introduce within control area two year study initiate area . In area , participant offer free treatment STDs identify survey . Free information sheet HIV-1 infection AIDS address gap information identify earlier study Honde Valley make available study participant area baseline survey . Risks participation research team community member believe low . Rigorous procedure follow avoid needle-stick injury ensure confidentiality information obtain , standard treatment offer STDs diagnose establish test associate procedure , prove reliable Zimbabwean setting , use HIV-1 diagnosis , particular , result make available participant . Dissemination study result do Biomedical Research Training Institute ( BRTI ) Blair Research Institute approval Ministry Health Child Welfare . An original copy data set study remain Zimbabwe BRTI and/or Blair . Approval study also obtain Central Oxford Research Ethics Committee United Kingdom prior implementation .
