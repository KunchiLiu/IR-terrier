	<detailed_description>The purpose propose research conduct randomize double-blind , multi-centre study two antiarrhythmic medication , digoxin propranolol , evaluate whether one medication effective reduce risk recurrent supraventricular tachycardia ( SVT ) infant . SVT common sustain arrhythmia infancy , occur 1 250-1000 child , serious health burden Canada internationally [ 1 , 5-8 ] . SVT common clinical problem face many health care provider , include general pediatrician , emergency room physician , nurse , cardiologist , intensive care physician . SVT carry significant morbidity mortality , patient typically receive long-term medical therapy . Untreated , infant tolerate SVT short period heart failure shock ( even death ) ensue . The management SVT currently debate often appear depend physician preference [ 9 ] . While spontaneous termination acute episode may occur [ 1 , 2 , 6 , 9 , 10 ] , many infant require medical intervention terminate episode . Vagal maneuvres adenosine reasonable success terminate acute SVT episode , medication may also require . Once acute episode treat , physician ( ) must make decision whether start maintenance ( chronic ) therapy . At present , clinical consensus management SVT infancy . The rationale chronic therapy SVT prevent recurrence limit symptom recurrence . Yet SVT recurrence readily predictable [ 11 ] . Many medication available treat SVT ; however , medication associate risk psychosocial implication family . To date , medication use treat infant SVT evaluate controlled study infant . Thus , present , physician must make decision initiation duration chronic therapy choice medication absence evidence control clinical trial . A prospective , randomized clinical study crucial provide evidence guide therapy infant SVT . As preliminary study inform propose trial , carry survey pediatric cardiologist North America [ 12 ] . In survey , present hypothetical case infant SVT ask acute chronic management . Several point clear : - 11 different medication choose management infant SVT ; - discrepancy among respondent respect medication choice , base whether respondent additional electrophysiology training ; - several physician select digoxin infant Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome ; medication choice may deleterious effect infant . Our survey identify , among wide range medication use manage infant SVT , two commonly use one digoxin propranolol . Digoxin propranolol well establish , widely use medication infant adult . Eighty-five percent survey respondent report use one manage infant SVT , rationalize choice determine whether one good reduce risk SVT recurrence whether one associate few adverse event . Furthermore , pediatric cardiologist electrophysiologists differ medication choice . Thus , provide evidence improve clinical decision-making infant health , propose conduct prospective , randomized double-blind , multi-centre study digoxin propranolol treatment infant SVT . The specific aim propose trial determine whether medication differ : 1 . Incidence recurrent SVT infants 6 month treatment propranolol digoxin ; 2 . Time first recurrence SVT infant treat propranolol digoxin ; 3 . Incidence adverse outcome infant treat propranolol digoxin . BACKGROUND SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA In infant child , SVT result primarily accessory connection atrium ventricle [ 5 , 8-10 , 13 ] . This provide substrate reentrant circuit utilize normal conduction system accessory pathway , result atrioventricular reciprocate tachycardia ( AVRT ) . A similar reentrant circuit exist within atrioventricular node , result atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia ( AVNRT ) ; however , much less common infant [ 5 , 13 , 14 ] . Both AVRT AVNRT result rapid heart rate attendant decrease diastolic filling time cardiac output . The differentiation two mechanism always easily make surface electrocardiogram ( ECG ) [ 8 , 15 ] , currently therapies apply condition [ 16 ] . Most case ( 61-73 % ) infant SVT occur age 4 month [ 9 , 17 , 18 ] , almost occur age 12 month [ 1 , 2 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 13 , 17-19 ] . In 1981 , Garson et al . report data one large retrospective series , encompass 217 SVT referral 25 year [ 6 ] . Infants present SVT 4 month age faster tachycardia rate great risk present congestive heart failure ( CHF ) ( 24 % ) old infant child . Although infant tolerate SVT &gt; 24 hour sign CHF ensue [ 1 ] , CHF see significant number patient ( 24-54 % ) come medical attention . Infants CHF progress cardiovascular collapse , account mortality 1-4 % infant SVT [ 2 , 5 , 6 , 20 ] . The acute management infant SVT debate often depend physician preference [ 9 ] . In 9-50 % case , acute SVT episode end spontaneously [ 1 , 2 , 6 , 9 , 10 ] 70-90 % patient , adenosine and/or vagal maneuvres ( e.g . apply ice pack face ) work reasonable success ; however , medication ( e.g . amiodarone ) may also require [ 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 ] . Once acute episode , physician family must make decision whether start chronic therapy . SVT RECURRENCE &amp; CHRONIC THERAPY The rationale chronic therapy SVT prevent recurrence limit symptom recurrence [ 8 ] . SVT repetitive , recurrence readily predictable [ 11 ] . There wide range—from 0 % 78 % —of report recurrence SVT , even medical treatment [ 1 , 2 , 6 , 19 , 21 ] . There several study reliable data ( see Table 1 end ) , report predictor recurrent episode may include data applicable patient may involve invasive study [ 21-23 ] . The physician attitude towards chronic therapy also change . While Garson 's 1981 study , chronic medication start 72 % case , survey indicate 98 % respondent would initiate chronic therapy [ 12 ] . This likely reflect goal minimize morbidity mortality care child heart disease . In Garson 's review , recurrence common ( 56 % ) ( 75 % ) occur within 3 month initial SVT presentation [ 6 ] . Perry et al . observe , 60 patient present 2 month age , SVT disappear 93 % 8 month age , many recurrence later life [ 19 ] . Tortoriello find patient without pre-excitation low ( 17 % ) risk recurrence [ 4 ] . Our knowledge natural history infant SVT incomplete , term need chronic therapy duration . Despite fact risk recurrence know ( may &lt; 50 % ) , due potential serious adverse outcome , pediatric cardiologist advocate chronic therapy infant present SVT . The early clinical course variable , patient require medical therapy beyond first month life [ 7 , 20 ] . The duration therapy range study currently last 6 12 month presentation [ 6 , 9 ] uncertainty clinical course [ 20 , 24 , 25 ] . The risk recurrence first year life determine definitively . THE MEDICATIONS Chronic therapy SVT usually entail daily antiarrhythmic medication ( see Table 2 ) . Currently , choice medication guide retrospective review , rather control trial [ 3-6 , 16 , 17 , 26 ] . Our survey identify , among wide range medication use manage infant SVT , commonly use digoxin propranolol [ 12 ] . Table 2 . Commonly used medication chronic treatment supraventricular tachycardia Digoxin Propranolol Sotalol Amiodarone Flecainide Propafenone Verapamil Atenolol Nadolol Digoxin sodium-potassium exchange pump inhibitor neuro-humoral effect effect cardiac conduction . Its efficacy antiarrhythmic drug attribute direct atrioventricular nodal block property , combine parasympathetic ( vagal ) activation , slow sinus rate , decrease conduction velocity , increase atrioventricular nodal refractoriness . For decade , digoxin report preferred medication prevent recurrence SVT infant [ 1 , 2 ] , remain common choice [ 3 , 4 ] . In one retrospective review 26 case infant SVT , Pfammatter &amp; Stockler find 65 % recurrence prophylactic digoxin therapy [ 3 ] . Deal et al report 61 % infant treat digoxin 37 % group require additional combination therapy , commonly propranolol [ 2 ] . Propranolol non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker sodium blockade , primarily exert antiarrhythmic effect antagonism catecholamine-mediated effect cardiac conduction . This antagonism result slow conduction velocity , increase refractoriness , reduce automaticity , especially sinoatrial atrioventricular nodal tissue . Propranolol also report effective SVT [ 17 ] . Retrospective review always find difference recurrence rate among infant treat digoxin versus propranolol : report equal efficacy prevent recurrent SVT [ 4 , 5 , 17 ] , others report low recurrence propranolol [ 27-29 ] . Digoxin propranolol wide range report efficacy prevent recurrence SVT [ 5 , 17 ] neither digoxin propranolol fully effective ; treatment failures reach 26 % [ 17 ] additional antiarrhythmic often require [ 4 , 8 , 16 , 26 , 30-36 ] . Digoxin propranolol often refer `` first-line agent '' , i.e . medication start initially prevent recurrence SVT . Several study report use medication combination without specify detail ( see Table 1 ) . There limited data side effect profile digoxin propranolol [ 16 , 37 , 38 ] . Despite lack data , digoxin propranolol use agent whose side effect profile subject great scrutiny , perhaps due relative `` newness '' [ 30-33 , 35 , 36 , 39 ] . Both frequently use chronic therapy infant SVT , never compare control trial . WHY THE TRIAL IS NEEDED NOW Management infant SVT confound several factor , include variable clinical course , inability predict recurrence , 'unknown ' natural history term resolution arrhythmia substrate . This create challenge health care practitioner family . Our preliminary survey demonstrate discrepancy pediatric electrophysiologists pediatric cardiologist medication choice treatment infant SVT [ 12 ] . It clear 'experts ' ( electrophysiologists ) manage SVT differently majority physician see infant SVT . Most importantly , treatment decision make without clear evidence support choice . The difference medication choice may reflect concern case report rapid conduction atrial arrhythmia digoxin use set Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [ 2 , 9 , 27 , 40 ] . It may electrophysiologists choose digoxin report high recurrence rate [ 10 , 20 , 26 ] ; clear whether digoxin pose risk first year life [ 17 , 41 ] . Propranolol report effective preventing recurrence continue recommend use [ 2 , 6 , 16 ] . Furthermore , interpretation exist body knowledge pose several limitation . For example , almost study SVT childhood retrospective nature , span many year , include study patient vary form SVT , include Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome structural heart disease . In many case , treatment failure success define consistently , multiple medication regimen common . At conclusion study , reference frequently make need control clinical trial . The lack control trial outcome , turn , cite key limitation interpret exist publish data [ 8 , 26 ] . The Health Protection Branch Health Canada The Food Drug Administration United States recognize need control clinical trial pediatric patient . To knowledge , neither digoxin propranolol evaluate pediatric use control trial context SVT , yet medication use frequently . Therefore , study need digoxin propranolol continue use common therapy prevention recurrent SVT . There significant debate effectiveness , division expert field general cardiologist . There may large impact patient one medication well adverse outcome ( e.g . hospital admission ) . The result trial significant potential direct impact infant health provision care Canada globally . This evidence large number electrophysiologists endorse trial .</detailed_description>
