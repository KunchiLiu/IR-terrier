	<brief_summary>At end 2004 40 million people infected Worldwide HIV , estimate 16,000 new infection every day ( UNAIDS , 2004 ) . The HIV epidemic threatens whole society particularly Africa Asia rate infection Western Countries also increase last year . However , despite 15 year research , effective vaccine HIV acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) still develop . There considerable evidence cellular immune response effectively control HIV-1 replication acute chronic infection thereby possibly protect individual infection prevent spread HIV . To truly effective general population , vaccine must induce response specific immunologically conserved region . The epitope-based vaccine MVA-mBN32 represent logical approach problem potential elicit polyfunctional immune response focus response conserve epitope . In study safety , tolerability immunogenicity recombinant MVA-BN® expressing CTL HTL epitopes HIV-1 ( MVA-mBN32 ) vs. vector control MVA-BN® 30 HIV-infected subject examine . This include full analysis CD4+ T helper cell CD8+ CTL responses epitope , establish potential homologous prime-boost vaccine approach induce broad cell-mediated response different HIV antigen .</brief_summary>
