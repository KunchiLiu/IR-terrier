	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify gene protein responsible specific muscle disorder study genetic material individual neuromuscular disease , well family member . We interest recruit many type neuromuscular disease include ; Duchenne Becker muscular dystrophy DMD/BMD , limb-girdle muscle dystrophy LGMD . There still many patient diagnose muscular dystrophy causative gene implicated disease . We feel patient may new genetic change gene cod important muscle protein yet identify . Using molecular genetics unravel biochemical basis neuromuscular disorder lead accurate diagnosis disorder lead potential therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our research many goal , one characterize genetic change responsible type muscle disease find participant . In past research , several new gene responsible various form neuromuscular disease identify and/or study . These include dystrophin , sarcoglycans , obscurin , filamin . Each discovery result advance ability develop diagnostic test benefit patient family provide accurate diagnosis , presymptomatic and/or prenatal testing . Genotype-phenotype correlation study increase understanding natural history rare disorder benefit patient well prognostic determination clinician . Biochemical pathological analysis muscle biopsy lead new insight disease pathophysiology hope aid finding treatment . Our research also study gene expression muscle biopsy sample . This entail identify gene whose expression increase decreased muscle individual different muscular dystrophy type . We believe study identify gene gene pathway common pathogenesis muscular dystrophy unique particular dystrophy . Our microarray research lead well understanding disease process possible way halt process . The end point study would accurate description disease pathogenesis .</detailed_description>
