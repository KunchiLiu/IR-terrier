	<brief_title>Ziv-aflibercept Treating Patients With Locally Advanced , Unresectable , Metastatic Gynecologic Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective response recurrent metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue sarcoma VEGF-Trap ( ziv-aflibercept ) . II . To assess incidence disease stabilization , measure 6-month progression-free survival , patient recurrent metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue sarcoma treat VEGF-Trap . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess time-to-progression overall survival patient recurrent metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue sarcoma treat VEGF-Trap . * As 24 October 2012 , overall survival follow-up discontinue one remain patient long term follow-up , protocol therapy least 3 year . Time progression median survival time base currently available data . II . To assess toxicity associate VEGF-Trap patient recurrent metastatic gynecologic soft-tissue sarcoma . III . To characterize population pharmacokinetics VEGF-Trap explore demographic clinical covariates OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord histology ( uterine leiomyosarcoma v malignant mixed mullerian tumor/carcinosarcoma ) . Patients receive ziv-aflibercept 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection baseline , every 8 week treatment , 60 day completion study treatment population pharmacokinetic analysis use enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
