	<brief_summary>The major goal study : 1 . To conduct intervention development study evaluate feasibility implementing exercise intervention reduction loss bone mineral density , muscle mass , strength , clinically relevant aspect function follow hip fracture , obtain preliminary test effective ness intervention . 2 . To evaluate effect home-based exercise intervention bone metabolism . 3 . To evaluate effect hip fracture bone metabolism . 4 . To evaluate effect exercise hip fracture hormonal regulator . 5 . To evaluate association marker bone metabolism hormone regulator , BMD . 6 . To separate effect hip fracture bone turnover age person low bone mineral density .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hip fracture major public health problem , strike consequence old patient , family health care system . More 350,000 person age 65 fracture hip United States come year estimate annual cost $ 12 billion ; 2040 , 650,000 hip fracture occur annually group . Between 18-33 % old hip fracture patient die within one year fracture , depend upon specific population study . Most survive hip fracture patient experience reduce mobility lose ability function independently . As many 45 % community dwell time fracture discharge institution post-hospitalization , 15-25 % remain institutionalized year post-fracture . Further , significant strain observe third family caregiver long year post-fracture . Depending upon population study function assess , estimate 25-75 % independent fracture neither walk independently achieve previous level independent living within year follow fracture 10- 20 % sustain hip fracture expect another osteoporotic fracture within two year . This protocol consist two component related recovery hip fracture ( describe ) : EXERCISE INTERVENTION TRIAL . With exception , restrict primarily study comprehensive in-patient rehabilitation , little systematic attention give evaluate strategy improve functioning , bone , muscle post-hip fracture . Strategies show improve bone , muscle , function old person fracture hip may useful applied person follow hip fracture . Exercise one strategies receive considerable attention . Exercise train old adult also beneficial effect bone density , muscle strength , physical functioning , well cardiovascular fitness , risk reduction fall fracture . An exercise program combine weight-bearing resistance exercise increase bone mineral content postmenopausal woman . Little information available whether home-based exercise program use achieve similar benefit compare structured , on-site exercise program . This issue particularly relevant old , frail woman sustain hip fracture many unable unwilling travel exercise facility . Results study exercise instructive potential benefit older person follow hip fracture . Most work date restrict relatively healthy , select sample older person recruit rigorously control randomized experiment . Hence , efficacious benefit select group old person , know whether intervention accept frail old population become suddenly disabled hip fracture , know whether intervention beneficial group lose bone , muscle function accelerate rate . Because loss BMD follow hip fracture place woman great rise subsequent fracture may delay prevent full recovery ambulatory ability , important optimize fracture heal prevent loss bone . One therapeutic option patient may effective increase physical activity exercise . Despite profound loss function , bone , muscle , remain uncertain extent loss attribute fracture , limited attention give preventing loss . In addition , seek understand role exercise relation bone metabolism level hormone think regulate bone metabolism follow hip fracture . Elucidating mechanisms valuable understanding effect exercise bone health . The purpose study take intervention know beneficial select population , real world set apply frail old person become suddenly disabled hip fracture . It essential test effectiveness intervention follow hip fracture . With waiver authorization obtain hospital , study nurse chart review hip fracture patient determine study eligibility explain study potential participant , obtain consent , get baseline study measure within fifteen day fracture . The project coordinator notify exercise trainer participant randomize treatment group , trainer set first home visit . After complete baseline interview participant assign one two study group . One group treatment group one involve treatment follow usual care . Those assigned treatment group visit exercise trainer visit participant three time week first two month study , two time per week month three four , one time per week month five six , two time month month seven eight , one time month month nine twelve . During month seven twelve study trainer contact participant telephone week week go participant ' home . Follow-up interview , performance assessment , DEXA scan , ultrasound measurement ( 34 participant ) blood draw do two , six twelve month follow hip fracture . The baseline follow-up interview last approximately two hour . NON-HIP FRACTURE COMPARISON . Bone loss occur old woman believe result uncouple bone remodeling . Despite loss BMD aging , cellular mechanism fracture heal appear remain intact . Fracture heal divide three phase : inflammatory , reparative , remodel . The first two phase dependent primarily local trauma effect fracture complete within approximately five week ; hence , exercise intervention would expect little effect process . The remainder approximately six-month duration femoral neck fracture heal involves model remodel callus . Because skeletal loading may modulate remodeling , exercise effect period . Even completion healing , mechanical factor expect continue affect remodel femur . Bone resorption , mediate osteoclastic activity , first phase remodel cycle . In post-fracture context , fracture debris removal callus remodel ongoing , high level marker resorption would anticipate . We attempt separate effect hip fracture bone turnover age person low bone mineral density . Bone turnover hip fracture patient receive usual care compare bone turnover similar group woman fracture hip ( i.e. , match age , ability ambulate independently , low BMD ) .</detailed_description>
