	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well sorafenib tosylate work treat patient medullary thyroid cancer spread part body ( metastatic ) , spread tissue surround thyroid ( locally advance ) , returned period improvement ( recurrent ) . Sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate Treating Patients With Metastatic , Locally Advanced , Recurrent Medullary Thyroid Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess objective response rate sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) ( sorafenib tosylate ) metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma set inherited tumor syndrome , multiple endocrine neoplasia ( MEN ) 2A , MEN 2B , familial medullary thyroid carcinoma ( FMTC ) . II . To assess objective response rate sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) sporadic metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity sorafenib ( BAY 43-9006 ) patient metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma . II . Measure serum tumor marker calcitonin carcinoembryonic antigen ( CEA ) pre- , , post-treatment correlate disease response . II . Correlate nuclear medicine functional imaging ( fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography [ PET ] scan ) data obtain pre- , , post-treatment tumor response patient . III . Correlate dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) data obtain pre- , , post-treatment change tumor permeability vascularity tumor response . IV . Perform pharmacogenomic study procure peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) clinical response observe patient . V. To correlate degree retrovirus-associated deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) sequence ( Ras ) -mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signal inhibition vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) expression tumor clinical response . VI . To correlate presence type ret proto-oncogene ( RET ) gene defect tumor clinical response . OUTLINE : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-56 . Treatment repeat every 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
