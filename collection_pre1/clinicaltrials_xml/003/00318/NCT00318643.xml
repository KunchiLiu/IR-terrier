	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore treatment patient superficial bladder cancer . The investigational medication study enzyme call hyaluronidase , human recombinant form enzyme . An investigational medication medication formulation medication approve United States Food Drug Administration use country may use study one . The drug company name medication Chemophase . Chemophase give combination mitomycin C. Mitomycin C give alone one time drug give together weekly 5 week . Mitomycin C anti-tumor drug commonly use treat superficial bladder cancer . Treatments administer directly bladder . It envision Chemophase mitomycin C may potentially increase local penetration mitomycin C remain cancer cell follow surgery treat superficial bladder cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Safety Study Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase ( Chemophase ) Combination With Mitomycin Patients With Superficial Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study : 1. determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) escalate dos Chemophase combination mitomycin ( mitomycin C , MMC ) administer weekly intravesical instillation five week , 2. establish dose Chemophase MMC recommend future study . The secondary objective study : 1. ass pharmacokinetics intravesical administration MMC alone combination intravesical administration Chemophase , 2. patient treated MTD , assess safety tolerability intravesical administration MMC Chemophase 7 additional maintenance treatment every 3 month follow initial six weekly instillation , 3. observe patient preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity MMC Chemophase combine . Study patient receive six ( 6 ) weekly study treatment ( Weeks 1 6 ) follow post-treatment evaluation , Weeks 8 12 . The 12 patient treat MTD continue receive combination therapy every three month end Year 2 time document tumor recurrence , whichever occur first . For patient , long-term follow-up Week 12 consist disease monitoring patient telephone perform every three ( 3 ) month begin three month last study treatment two year every six ( 6 ) month thereafter , bladder tumor recurrence . The following therapy prohibit time enrollment Week 12 study : - Treatment heparin - Any intravesical therapy except MMC Chemophase - Any potentially myelosuppressive therapy For MTD patient receive continued study drug treatment Week 12 , follow therapy prohibit duration study drug treatment : - Any intravesical therapy except MMC Chemophase - Any potentially myelosuppressive therapy</detailed_description>
