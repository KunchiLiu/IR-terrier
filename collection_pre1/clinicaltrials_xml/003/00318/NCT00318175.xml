	<brief_title>Effect Bosentan Skin Fibrosis Patients With Systemic Sclerosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) polymorphic disorder unknown cause characterize fibrosis skin , blood vessel , visceral organ . The degree skin involvement important outcome measure patient disease . The pathogenesis SSc involve immunologic mechanism , vascular damage , excessive accumulation extracellular matrix component skin . One reason change mean increased release endothelin-1 , peptide vasoconstrictor effect possess mitogenic activity culture vascular smooth muscle cell fibroblast , cell type involve SSc pathogenesis . Interestingly , endothelin-1 level raise patient SSc RaynaudÂ´s disease , particularly , subset patient diffuse cutaneous SSc widespread dermal sclerosis . However , skin fibrosis SSc poorly study , rare condition approve therapy . Bosentan dual endothelin receptor antagonist , compete bind endothelin-1 receptor ( ET-A AT-B ) . It recently show effective treatment idiopathic well pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) SSc , also prove two multicenter randomize prospective placebo-controlled double-blind study Europe US ( RAPIDS-1 RAPIDS-2 ) beneficial effect bosentan prevent digital ulcer patient . Furthermore , suggest bosentan also positive effect skin fibrosis . In study , skin fibrosis measure use 20-MHz-ultrasound , Rodnan Skin Score , investigation fist closure patient treatment bosentan 24 week .</detailed_description>
