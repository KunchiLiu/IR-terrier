	<brief_title>Acceptability Pharmacologic Treatment Methamphetamine Dependence Among MSM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high rate meth use among MSM parallel evidence rise sexual risk behavior HIV infection among population . The MSM meth epidemic , link HIV transmission , underscore need pilot test new , innovative modality reduce meth use meth-associated sexual risk behavior . Ultimately , pharmacologic treatment meth use may serve improve outcome among access current treatment service , might also benefit willing able utilize service . While study show MSM enter substance use treatment decrease substance use sexual risk behavior , current behavioral meth treatment program report low rate success treat meth dependence among MSM . We believe time come test acceptability pharmacologic intervention reduce meth use among MSM , assess feasibility conduct trial among sexually active , meth-dependent MSM , whose meth-associated sexual behavior use place extraordinarily high risk transmit acquire HIV . In pilot study , provide meth-dependent MSM placebo daily bupropion XL ( extended-release ) , well-tolerated dopamine agonist potential reduce meth use . The specific aim study : 1 . To assess feasibility enrol retain meth-dependent MSM randomize , double-blind study bupropion versus placebo biologic ( urine meth test ) behavioral ( sexual risk ) measure . 2 . To explore tolerability bupropion placebo among meth-dependent MSM , determine number adverse clinical event bupropion placebo arm . 3 . To describe acceptability bupropion placebo among meth-dependent MSM , measure ( via electronic pill cap ) medication adherence bupropion placebo . This randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , two-arm pilot study enroll 30 meth-dependent MSM assign receive 3 month bupropion XL 300 mg daily placebo . We include HIV- HIV-INFECTED MSM , meth use common group . We enroll meth-dependent MSM likely population benefit potential treatment . Participants see weekly urine specimen collection substance-use counseling . Clinical exam , medical history , specimen collection , behavioral assessment perform baseline 1 , 2 , 3 month visit . Interim visit schedule whenever indicated sign symptom . Our decision maintain participant 3 month bupropion base smoking literature , demonstrate bupropion 's efficacy treat nicotine addiction within similar time period ; anticipate future efficacy trial maintain participant bupropion duration .</detailed_description>
