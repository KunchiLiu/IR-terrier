	<detailed_description>Asthma prevalence steadily increase United States since early 1980s ; currently , 20 million people diagnosed asthma . Individuals disease may experience periodic attack wheeze , shortness breath , chest tightness , cough . While many known cause asthma , include tobacco smoke allergen , exact cause asthma case remain unknown . Research show individual , respiratory airway infection may play role onset severity disease . Inhaled corticosteroid commonly use treat asthma ; however , effectively control symptoms everyone . Clarithromycin , antibiotic medication use treat bacterial infection , may effective asthma treatment individual respond well inhaled corticosteroid . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness clarithromycin reduce asthma symptom . This study begin 4-week run-in period standardize participant ' asthma medication usage . During time , participant stop current asthma medication instead receive inhaled fluticasone twice day . Albuterol available rescue medication necessary . Study visit take place every 2 week . Blood saliva sample obtain laboratory test participant complete standardized questionnaire assess asthma symptom quality life . Spirometry perform measure lung function . Medication adherence monitor daily diary electronic pill count device . At end Week 4 , participant evaluate study eligibility . If eligible , participant undergo bronchoscopy lung biopsy test Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae , two bacteria identify possible factor development asthma . The treatment phase study last 16 week . Participants randomly assign receive either 500 mg clarithromycin placebo twice day , plus inhaled fluticasone . At monthly study visit , spirometry blood collection perform . Standardized questionnaire assess asthma symptom complete every 2 week . Medical adherence continue monitor . At end Week 16 , participant stop receive clarithromycin placebo , continue receive fluticasone . Asthma symptom , rescue medication usage , quality life , lung capacity assess ; tissue sample examine presence Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae . An 8-week washout period follow observe linger medication effect monitor safety . Monthly study visit period include spirometry blood collection .</detailed_description>
