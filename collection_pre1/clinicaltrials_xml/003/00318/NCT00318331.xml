	<brief_summary>Glutamine amino acid rapidly deplete critical illness . It use energy cell line gut , vital immune system function , work anti-oxidant . Glutamine supplementation show improve outcome ICU patient . We hypothesize critically ill patient give extra glutamine less inflammatory response therefore well outcomes patient give extra glutamine . Our study randomize patient tube feed OR without extra glutamine see affect patient outcomes well marker inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Glutamine , nonessential amino acid , preferred fuel rapidly proliferate cell human body . Those cell include enterocytes small intestine , lymphocytes , macrophage , fibroblast . Glutamine also transport nitrogen tissue serve precursor glutathione potent antioxidant . A healthy human body contain abundant glutamine , either diet skeletal muscle tissue synthesize . During critical illness demand glutamine increase . Rapid depletion glutamine store critically ill patient describe correlate increased mortality . Glutamine depletion may deleterious critical illness adverse effect essential function mention . For example glutamine depletion may cause gut mucosal barrier function deteriorate , lead bacterial translocation enhance systemic inflammatory response increase risk multisystem organ failure . Clinical trial perform wide range patient serious illness , include cancer , trauma , burn , major surgery critical illness , demonstrate possible benefit glutamine supplementation . Interpretation result multiple study make difficult base difference glutamine dosing , route administration , population study , endpoint use . Blood volume analysis show good measure capillary leak . The DAXOR blood volume analyzer kit recently approve FDA blood volume analysis also capacity measure capillary permeability look slope albumin transudation . It simpler way measure capillary permeability method describe . Reviewing previous study result , glutamine supplementation parental form high dose various patient population show evidence beneficial . Studies enteral glutamine therapy also show benefit , result less consistent possibly heterogeneous study methodology describe . Moreover , study carry burn patient surgical patient ; study critical ill medical patient . Finally study specifically looked mechanism via glutamine confer protection . Comparison : Critically ill patient give enteral tube feed compare critically ill patient give enteral tube feed supplemental glutamine .</detailed_description>
