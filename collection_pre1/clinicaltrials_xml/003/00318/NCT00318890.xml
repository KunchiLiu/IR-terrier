	<brief_title>Cisplatin Docetaxel Plus Docetaxel Radiotherapy With Amifostine Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority head neck cancer patient present advanced stage III IV disease . The treatment cancer head neck profound consequence regard functional ability speech eat . In treatment locally advance HNSCC site organ preservation desirable , radiation therapy major method treatment . However , single modality , radiation therapy cure few 30 % patient advanced disease . Attempts improve outcome locally advance HNSCC generally add chemotherapy radiotherapy . However , optimal manner integrate chemotherapy plan care controversial . Chemotherapy use commonly either induction therapy precede radiation , recently concomitant therapy along radiation . Induction chemotherapy associate high response rate 60-90 % , significant change loco-regional control survival.Clinical trial incorporate chemotherapy concurrent radiation recently generate considerable interest . To accomplish loco-regional control reduce systemic metastasis , trial proposes induction chemotherapy follow concomitant chemotherapy-radiation escalate dose docetaxel patient locally advance previously untreated HNSCC .</detailed_description>
