	<brief_summary>Background : - Research show clonidine , drug originally prescribe treat high blood pressure symptom opioid withdrawal , help block stress-induced relapse heroin cocaine seek rat . However , seem block cue-induced relapse rat . Researchers interested study whether clonidine show pattern effect stress- cue-induced craving heroin cocaine human . Objectives : - To compare ability clonidine reduce stress- cue-induced cocaine heroin crave drug abuser . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 55 year age current cocaine heroin user . Design : - This study consist two visit : screen visit determine eligibility experimental/script session . - Before script session , participant provide urine breath sample test . Participants complete questionnaire measure current drug craving day since last use cocaine heroin . - At start script session , participant receive dose clonidine placebo direct study researcher . Three hour dose , participant read four script ( two neutral , one stress-inducing , one drug-cue-related ) break script . After script , participant respond question level stress craving . - Participants provide saliva sample immediately script reading , also measure skin response script .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background . Stress exposure drug-related cue ( environmental stimulus previously associate drug availability ) consider factor increase risk relapse heroin and/or cocaine use . The two factor may act different neural mechanism . Alpha-2 adrenergic agonist , clonidine , show block stress-induced relapse , cue-induced relapse , heroin cocaine self-administration rodent . The ability clonidine attenuate stress- cue-induced heroin cocaine crave drug abuser test . It important determine , human , whether clonidine block acute effect one putative class relapse precipitant , whether effect general . Scientific goal . To compare ability clonidine reduce stress-induced cue-induced cocaine heroin crave drug abuser . Participant population . A total 160 drug abuser use cocaine , heroin , enrol . Target enrollment include 40 % woman 60 % minority ( mostly African-American ) . Experimental design method . Participants randomize one three group receive clonidine 0.1 mg , clonidine 0.2 mg , placebo orally double-blind condition . The study consist single 5-6 hr experimental session baseline measure , drug administration , four script-guided imagery set , follow period data collection . Three hour dose ( peak plasma clonidine concentration reach ) , participant expose four script : one stress-inducing , one describe drug cue , two neutral content . The standardized script-guided imagery procedure previously show reliably induce negative affective state ( stress script ) and/or crave ( stress drug-cue script ) compare neutral script internal external validity ( Tiffany Drobes , 1990 ; Maude-Griffin Tiffany , 1996 ; Taylor et al. , 2000 ; Sinha et al. , 1999 , 2000 , 2003 ; Singleton et al. , 2003 ; Tiffany Haekeneworth , 1991 ; Elash et al. , 1995 ; Drobes Tiffany , 1997 ; Taylor et al. , 2000 ; Singleton et al. , 2003 ) . Outcome measure include subjective rating drug crave mood , autonomic response ( galvanic skin response [ GSR ] ) , endocrine response ( salivary cortisol salivary ? -amylase , measure endogenous adrenergic activity stress ( Chatterton et al. , 1996 ; Nater et al. , 2005 ; van Stegeren et al. , 2005 ) ) . Benefits participant and/or society . There direct benefit participant . However , clonidine effective block stress-induced and/or cue-induced craving , result use basis design treatment trial , drug abuser society may benefit eventual use clonidine alpha agonists prevention relapse cocaine heroin user . In addition , research provide information clinical relevance preclinical model relapse , possibly strengthen argument use medication development . Risks participant . Participants may experience side effect clonidine sedation expect experience brief , mild psychological stress drug crave laboratory script procedure . Prior leave session , participant assess presence continue drug effect . If participant experience stress crave end session , undergo 10-minute guided relaxation session , repeat feeling stress crave dissipate , release laboratory . Participants may keep long plan session length , include stay overnight inpatient ward , continue side effect elevate stress craving . If MRP deem medically necessary , participant send JHBMC emergency department evaluation treatment .</detailed_description>
