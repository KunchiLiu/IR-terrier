	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Benefits Early Detection Intensive Treatment Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although diabetes commonly undiagnosed many patient evidence complication diagnosis , definitive evidence early detection improve health outcome . One critical uncertain factor extent screen subsequent treatment reduces cardiovascular risk . Multi-factorial cardiovascular risk reduction people prevalent diabetes microalbuminuria result halve heart disease risk . However , certain whether result generalise patient without microalbuminuria whose disease screen-detected . The ADDITION study collaborative randomise control trial target-driven intensive multi-factorial approach cardiovascular risk reduction patient screen-detected type 2 diabetes mellitus , aim assess feasibility screen primary care set quantify cardiovascular benefit economic psychological cost screen . The study whole power determine whether screen intensive multi-factorial intervention result improve cardiovascular outcome . The ADDITON-Leicester study contribute collaboration , demonstrate feasibility screen measure effect ADDITION study intervention model cardiovascular risk 1 year detection screen population high risk virtue high proportion people South Asia ( Leicester ) . The study also assess impact intensive intervention model cardiovascular risk 1 year . People South Asian origin increase risk diabetes develop heart disease . The issue screen thus particularly relevant population . However , population currently recruit ADDITION predominantly Caucasian . The ADDITION-Leicester study ass feasibility systematic screening South Asian population , quantify effect intensive treatment people screen detect diabetes model cardiovascular risk 1 year assess economic psychological cost screen intensive treatment . This study population contribute ADDITION-Europe study , whole power assess impact screen intensive treatment 5 year cardiovascular outcome .</detailed_description>
