Vaccination produce nicotine-specific antibody may view alternative method block nicotine effect . Nicotine small molecule elicit immune response animal human . In order immune system respond hapten , nicotine combine bound large molecule unique manner immune response mount nicotine . Nabi Biopharmaceuticals develop conjugate vaccine ( NicVAX ) consist 3'-aminomethylnicotine bound Pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein A , exotoxin make non-toxic amino acid deletion . Subjects randomize one four treatment group . Within treatment group , 75 subject randomize 2:1 ratio ( NicVAX : Placebo ) , yield total 50 active 25 placebo subject treatment group .
