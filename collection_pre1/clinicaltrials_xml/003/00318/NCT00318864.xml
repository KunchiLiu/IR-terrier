	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine improvement mood ameliorate autonomic dysregulation , HPA dysfunction typical ( e.g . lipid ) atypical risk factor depress patient elevate cardiovascular risk ( CVD ) . Up 70 , depress participant elevate cardiovascular risk factor randomize cognitive behavioral intervention ( CBT ) wait list control ( WLC ) condition . Twenty non-depressed age risk-matched control also recruit . Traditional risk factor ( e.g . lipid , blood pressure , heart rate ) , atypical risk factor ( endothelial function , asymmetric dimethylarginine , C-reactive protein ) measure pre post treatment six month later Subjects undergo psychophysiological stress test cardiovascular physiology measure . Salivary cortisol measure day psychological stress test . Depressed subject randomize 16 week cognitive behavior therapy intervention wait-list control . It hypothesize reduction mood associate reduction typical atypical risk factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recruitment : The sample drawn follow Stanford Health Services clinic : Stanford Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Clinic , Electron Beam Computed Tomography Center , Cardiology Clinics . Subjects also recruit via mass medium . Screen : Potential subject identify brief screen combine short follow-up interview , PRIME-MD consist two self-report item , follow : “ During PAST MONTH , bother A LOT ( 1 ) little interest pleasure thing ( yes ) ( 2 ) feeling , depress , hopeless ( yes ) . ” If either item score “ yes , ” short follow-up interview establish diagnosis indicate . The two screen item yield sensitivity 69 % specificity 82 % diagnosis make mental health professional use criterion standard . Subjects also general health questionnaire score &gt; 5 , indicate high level distress . Potentially eligible subject undergo structure clinical interview diagnosis . Twenty , age , gender cardiovascular risk level control select population . Controls match age , sex risk depress subject . Procedures : Participants come Department Psychiatry baseline assessment , include undergoing structured psychiatric examination complete baseline self-report measure . If interested eligible ask complete series assessment last three day . On day one , ask report Stanford General Research Center next available Wednesday , 9:00 . At time medical exam perform , blood draw FMVD ( see ) undertaken . They ask wear `` lifeshirt , '' undergarment worn chest measure heart rate day , report mood activity 5 occassions use portable computer attach lifeshirt . Each participant schedule obtain saliva sample use cotton swab `` salivette device '' time waking , 30 minute later , 1200h , 1700h , 2100h two day . Participants ask refrigerate sample immediately collection , eat , drink , smoke , brush teeth , use mouthwash 30 minute collection , drink alcohol 8-10 hour prior collect sample day collection . On day two return life-shirt continue obtain salivary cortisol . On day three ask return Stanford GCRC undertaken psychological stress test . The psychological stress test standardize social cognitive stressor compose 5 minute anticipatory stress , 5 minute public speaking ( simulated job interview ) 5 minute mental arithmetic , do panel 2 evaluator . Subjects sit comfortable chair throughout entire procedure . Subjects informed speech would evaluate panel two expert behavioral coder would rat basis poise , speak ability , expressiveness . During psychological stress number physiologic function measure use sensor attach chest arm . Subjects also ask provide saliva sample measurement report mood . At end stress test meet investigator debriefed . Depressed subject randomize cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) ask attend 16 , one-hour session 4-5 month . The CBT conduce senior therapist . Cognitive therapy aim symptom removal identification correction patient ’ distort , negatively bias , moment-to-moment thinking theoretically aim prevention relapse/reoccurrence identify correct silent assumption ( personal belief schema ) . Modern cognitive treatment intervention also address behavioral aspect depression encourage activity various kind . ( Because level physical condition potential confound variables interest , increase aerobic activity include intervention . ) Depressed control subject offer CBT intervention ( group format ) six-month follow-up and/or refer treatment , desire appropriate . At post-treatment six-month follow-up , subject carefully assess psychotherapy psychopharmacology intervention . The assessment conduct baseline six month later . Measures : Intervention Descriptive Control Variables : Baseline demographic information include education , ethnicity marital status . Structured Clinical Interview Diagnosis ( SCID ) . A structured clinical interview diagnosis modify include Hamilton Depression Interview use . Structured clinical interview standard method diagnosis psychiatry study . Medical status . A standard questionnaire concern coronary risk factor , medication , medical diagnosis complete baseline subject . Heart rate baseline ECG . Resting 12-lead ECG record use standard electrocardiograph time treadmill . Subjects CVD event evident ECG exclude . Blood pressure . Resting blood pressure measure triplicate asculatory technique use mercury sphygmomanometer . Body weight ( kg ) height ( ) . Weight ( kg ) measure balance beam scale . Height weight obtain stand position , shoe remove subject wear street clothes . Lipids apolipoproteins . Fasting plasma level total cholesterol triglyceride obtain fast sample . Duplex ultrasonography flow-mediated vasodilation ( FMVD ) . The method follow : Diameter brachial arterial ( DBA ) measure multiple single time point 4 state use standard 7 MHz linear array transducer Hewlett-Packard system ( Hewlett-Packard , Palo Alto , California ) . The four state include : rest , limb ischemia ( create inflate blood pressure cuff place distal brachial artery supra-systemic pressure ) , response reactive hyperemia ( increase flow produce endothelium-dependent vasodilation ) . Measurements three state repeat second time . Finally , DBA measure ( 4 ) response administration sublingual nitroglycerin . ADMA ( asymmetric dimethylarginine ) measure . Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Activity Cortisol diurnal cortisol variation . Cortisol measure use self-administered saliva sample . Subjects obtain sample three consecutive day , five interval throughout day ( wake , 45 minute later , 5 pm , 9 pm bedtime ) , subject ’ home . A testing kit use subject consist 15 salivette tube . Salivary cortisol find reliable tool investigation hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity . Laboratory Assessment RSA Baroreflex Sensitivity RSA baroreflex sensitivity assess noninvasively laboratory 10-minute baseline . Physiological channel require quantification record use ( 1 ) ECG ( 400 Hz sample rate ) ; ( 2 ) two channel respiration use Respitrace system ( Ambulatory Monitoring , Ardsley , NY ) ; band place around upper thorax around abdomen calibrate spirometry ( 25 Hz sample rate ) ; ( 3 ) continuous arterial blood pressure waveform index finger mean Finapres 2300 system . Depression measure include Hamilton Depression Interview ( HDI ) Beck Depression Interview ( BDI ) , short 21-item also obrtained . Perceived Stress Perceived Stress Scale ( PSS ) . The PSS measure global perception stress previous month . It short version comprise ten item , e.g. , `` In last month often felt difficulty pile high could overcome ? '' Response option assess use 5-point Likert-type scale : ( 0 = Never 4= Very Often ) . The score four item word opposite direction ( e.g. , `` In last month often felt thing go way ? '' ) reverse-scored .</detailed_description>
