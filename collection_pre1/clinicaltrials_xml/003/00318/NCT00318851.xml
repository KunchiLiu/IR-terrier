	<brief_title>Carotid Artery Stenting With Protection Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke third common cause death North America approximately 750,000 new stroke report annually , 150,000 fatal . Approximately 75 % stroke occur distribution carotid artery . Among , thrombotic etiology ( carotid occlusive disease ) one common cause . Recently publish study show patient underwent carotid stenting combination cerebral protection device well overall outcome related stroke , death MI oppose carotid endarterectomy . What know whether protection device allow particle ( 100 micron particle size less ) pas filter particle embolize placement removal protection device , delay abnormal outcome determine neuropsychological testing .</detailed_description>

Must anatomic stenosis great 70 % ultrasound angiography perform previous 30 day Asymptomatic patient stenosis great 80 % ultrasound angiography perform previous 30 day Patient childbearing potential negative pregnancy test within one week prior procedure . Patient patient 's physician agree patient return require clinical contact follow study enrollment Patient sign inform consent Patient exclude multiinstitutional trial Patient evolve stroke intracranial hemorrhage Allergy trial require medication Active bleed diathesis coagulopathy , refuse blood transfusion History major ipsilateral stroke sufficient atrophy increase risk procedure associate bleed Severe dementia Previous intracranial hemorrhage brain surgery within past twelve month Patient condition precludes angiography would make percutaneous procedure unsafe Patient family inability understand cooperate study procedure Recent GI remote bleed would interfere antiplate therapy Severe vessel tortuosity calcification would preclude introduction guide catheter , guide sheath , stent placement Extensive diffuse atherosclerotic disease involve arch common carotid would preclude safe introduction catheter sheaths endovascular therapy Intraluminal filling defect Intracranial aneurysm great 6 mm , AVM , intracranial vascular abnormality would preclude safe intravascular intervention</criteria>
