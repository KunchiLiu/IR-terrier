	<brief_summary>As influenza vaccine efficacy report low elderly subject compare healthy adult , probably result immunosenescence , desire devise way increase current vaccine efficacy target population . Adjuvants know boost immune response , thus represent one way increase efficacy current GlaxoSmithKline Fluarix™ influenza vaccine elderly subject . The purpose study evaluate immunogenicity reactogenicity vaccination four different adjuvanted GlaxoSmithKline influenza vaccine administer elderly subject .
