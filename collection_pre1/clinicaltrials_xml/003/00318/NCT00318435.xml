	<brief_summary>The type hemodialysis access preservation access greatly influence quality life survival patient undergoing hemodialysis . The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( K/DOQI ) guideline vascular access recommend primary placement native autogenous hemodialysis fistula preference polytetrafluoroethylene ( PTFE ) graft central venous catheter former form access few complication longer durability . However , autogenous hemodialysis fistula , like polytetrafluoroethylene graft , also subject dysfunction eventual failure . Endovascular angioplasty become accept alternative treatment surgical revision hemodialysis access-related venous stenosis occlusion . However , patency rate follow-up period low high frequency restenosis due intimal hyperplasia . Since 1988 , noncovered stent use improve fistula patency . In central vein , bare stent demonstrate good patency rate percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) alone . Neointimal hyperplasia major reason restenosis follow stent placement . The cephalic vein form outflow conduit radiocephalic brachiocephalic autogenous fistula . It recently suggest focal area cephalic vein prone develop hemodynamically significant stenosis , term cephalic arch . This perpendicular portion cephalic vein region deltopectoral groove junction axillary vein . To overcome problem restenosis due intimal hyperplasia cephalic arch investigator use insertion stent-graft alternative approach . In study investigate use PTFE-covered nitinol stent-graft ( Fluency , Bard ) versus Luminex ( Bard ) stent .</brief_summary>
