	<detailed_description>There bimodal distribution new onset seizures one peak occur young second peak occur person age 65 year . The presentation seizures elderly may vary young patient diagnosis may confuse condition transient ischemic attack . However , consequence epilepsy elderly severe lead impaired cognition , increase fall , decrease quality life . The treatment epilepsy may complicate pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic change occur elderly . Three Veterans Cooperative trial evaluate antiepileptic drug ( AED ) therapy elderly demonstrate ability tolerate AED determine factor long term success ability suppress seizure activity . In general , elderly patient appear intolerable medication . This may stem co-morbid condition , concurrent medication , pharmacokinetic change , and/or pharmacodynamic change . Therefore , important study efficacy tolerability AEDs elderly . Valproic acid available treatment partial generalize seizure since 1978 . Sodium divalproex metabolize gut valproic acid . Depakote Depakote-ER ( extended release ) among dosage form sodium divalproex . Depakote enteric coat tablet design dissolve alkaline milieu small intestine rather acidic milieu stomach . This help drug bypass stomach reduce gastrointestinal distress . Once enteric coat dissolve , sodium divalproex metabolize valproic acid rapidly absorb . Depakote administer twice day . Depakote-ER control release drug delivery system design release drug 22 hour period allow day dose . The efficacy tolerability Depakote-ER describe elderly patient epilepsy .</detailed_description>
