	<detailed_description>Ragweed allergy common trigger asthmatic flare-ups people asthma . Individuals ragweed allergy suffer increase asthma symptom fall allergy season , generally run August November . These flare-up significantly impact asthma patient 's quality life . AIC investigational medicine combine special DNA sequence modify way immune system responds . In AIC , sequence link piece ragweed pollen molecule ( know Amb 1 ) cause hay fever symptom . Injections AIC show change way immune system respond ragweed pollen animal human way may lead reduce hay fever symptom . In previous study , AIC safe well tolerate , patient exhibit decrease allergy symptom last 2 year treatment average . This study evaluate whether short-term use AIC spring cause long-term immune tolerance ragweed , reduce asthma symptom , decrease use asthma medication future allergy season . During 2007 fall ragweed allergy season , participant observe asked keep diary asthma symptom medication use . In spring 2008 , participant randomly assign receive six weekly dos either experimental medicine placebo . Participants observe 2008 fall ragweed season . Another series three weekly dos assign study treatment give spring 2009 , observation 2009 fall ragweed allergy season possibly 2010 season . During observation period , participant ask track asthma symptom medication use report information study staff . Study visit weekly spring biweekly ragweed season , maximum 16 visit per year .
