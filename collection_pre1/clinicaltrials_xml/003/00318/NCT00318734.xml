	<detailed_description>CVD disorder affect heart 's ability function normally . The common cause heart disease narrow blockage coronary artery , supply blood heart . There many risk factor CVD , include inflammation , high blood pressure , high cholesterol , obesity . Small quantity trace element , also know micronutrient , essential maintain healthy body . Research show trace element may associate development CVD , research need confirm connection . This study examine concentration several trace element toenail sample young adult participate Coronary Artery Risk Development Young Adults ( CARDIA ) study . The CARDIA study measure change CVD risk factor individual age identify lifestyle habit influence change . The purpose study determine link trace element CVD risk factor young adult . The result study may help identify whether dietary , lifestyle , environmental factor modify young age prevent development CVD . This study examine laboratory medical history data participant already enrol CARDIA study ; additional study visit specifically study . Toenail sample collect participant Year 2 CARDIA study visit late 1980 's examine determine presence selenium , chromium , arsenic , mercury . Participants ' CARDIA study data review several CVD risk factor analyze , include thickness heart artery ; calcium buildup within artery ; inflammatory marker , high sensitivity C-reactive protein interleukin 6 ; blood pressure level ; body weight ; level cholesterol , fat , sugar .</detailed_description>
