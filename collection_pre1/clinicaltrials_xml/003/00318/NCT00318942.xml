	<brief_summary>Background : Two recent systematic review literature meta-analyses suggest colloid administration might deleterious critically ill patient . Objective : To compare effect hospital mortality crystalloids colloid give fluid resuscitation critically ill patient . Setting : Adult intensive care unit ( ICUs ) several European country . Study design : A multinational , randomise , control trial perform two parallel group . Intervention : Any type crystalloids ( control group ) versus type colloid ( include albumin ) . Patients : All patient legal age consent hospitalise intensive care unit , need fluid resuscitation ( accord physician ) . Pregnant woman , moribund patient , brain dead patient , patient know allergy colloid severe head injury major burn ( &gt; 20 % body surface ) dehydration include . Primary endpoint : 28-day mortality . Hypothesis : Assuming hospital mortality rate 20 % crystalloids group , 0.05 type I error , 3010 patient need show difference 2 group 5 % 90 % probability ( two-sided test ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Colloids Versus Crystalloids Fluid Resuscitation Critically Ill Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Fluid resuscitation common treatment ICU , every day thousand critically ill patient treat around world crystalloids colloid correct hypovolaemia ( 1 , 2 ) . A wide diversity fluid available , new product come near future . In 1989 , French consensus conference recommend abandon use fresh frozen plasma limit use albumin specific situation ( e.g . contraindication colloid , serum protein level 35 g/l ) ( 1 ) . Crystalloids gelatins consider best solution fluid resuscitation critically ill . In 1997 , starch increasingly use , guideline update ( 2 ) . It conclude isotonic crystalloids efficacious starch pending amount fluid administer . Three systematic review literature provide accurate summary data available randomise controlled trial evaluate human albumin ( 3 ) , compare crystalloids colloid fluid resuscitation critically ill patient ( 4,5 ) . The first systematic review ( 3 ) analyse 30 randomised trial conclude evidence albumin administration reduces risk death critically ill patient . By contrast , review suggest albumin administration might increase 6 % risk death . In Cochrane Injury Review Group systematic review ( 4 ) , 40 randomised trial analyse . The author conclude administration colloid might associate absolute increase 3.8 % risk death . The last review analyse 17 randomised trial decide exclude study hypertonic saline . This review show significant difference risk death colloid crystalloids outcome like prevalence pulmonary edema length stay ICU hospital ( 5 ) . However , author consider study high methodological quality score , observed nice trend toward increase survival rate favour crystalloids . They reach conclusion subset trauma patient . JUSTIFICATION FOR THE STUDY It seem reasonable abandon use fresh frozen plasma fluid resuscitation critically ill patient . There definite criterion decide crystalloids colloid prefer . It unquestionable , achieve give haemodynamic effect , amount crystalloids need almost twice amount colloid ( 1 , 2 ) . Colloids crystalloids different effect range important physiological parameter . As critically ill patient underwent one volume replacement , even small increase risk death ( around 5 % ) considerable clinical implication . The meta analyse suggest 5 % absolute risk reduction mortality favour crystalloids ( 4 , 5 ) . The number need treat , estimate clinically meaningful ( 6 ) , 20 , suggest 1 additional death ( colloid ) every 20 patient resuscitate . Given number patient expose fluid resuscitation , 60 additional death might observe per year ICU , receive 600 patient year . A large trial need compare safety efficacy colloid crystalloids ( 4,5 ) . OBJECTIVES Primary objective : To compare effect 28-day mortality colloid versus crystalloids ICU patient need fluid resuscitation . Secondary objective : ICU hospital mortality morbidity , safety . STUDY DESIGN A multinational , randomise , control trial , two parallel group . STUDY TREATMENTS - Arm A : crystalloids - Arm B : colloid Allocated treatment must start immediately randomisation ( Day-0 ) - The amount speed fluid load physician ' discretion . The amount starch exceed 30 ml/kg/24 hour . In case additional volume replacement necessary , gelatin albumin may use . During ICU stay , patient receive crystalloids colloid fluid resuscitation , accord randomisation . Double blind seem unfeasible time window inclusion extremely short ( treatment available promptly bedside ) amount volume replacement ICU stay could predict priori . Allowed co-interventions : - Any treatment require pre-existing condition - Any type inotropes vasopressor - Red cell , platelet , fresh frozen plasma , use follow general guideline ( 2 ) . Co-interventions allow : Any volume replacement solution mention . Albumin allow patient allocated crystalloids unless plasma albumin level 20 g/dl ( 2 ) . ENDPOINTS Main endpoint : - 28-day mortality rate . Secondary endpoint : - ICU Hospital mortality rate - Number ICU day patient alive free - mechanical ventilation , - vasopressor inotropes , - renal replacement therapy , - organ system failure accord sequential organ failure assessment ( SOFA ) score system [ 7 ] - Total amount volume replacement - Difference - AUC mean arterial pressure HO H24 Day-0 - weight Day-0 Day-1 Day-2 - PaO2/FiO2 ratio H0 H12 H24 , Day-0 - chest X-ray score day-0 Day-1 day-2 ( 8 ) - Frequency adverse event - Anaphylaxis reaction : skin mucous rash , nausea , vomit , shock , bronchial spasm , respiratory cardiac arrest - Coagulation disorder : fall prothrombin time ( PT ) rate , factor VIII - Impairment renal function : increase creatinine &gt; 200 µmol/l - Length stay ICU - Length hospital stay RANDOMISATION The list randomisation generate computer . We use block randomisation stratify site diagnosis , 1. trauma haemorrhage , 2. sepsis , 3. diagnosis . Modalities : - Day randomisation = Day-0 - The delay decision resuscitate patient fluids randomisation short possible ( 15 minute less ) . Thus , use seal envelope seem best method allocation concealment case . There centre , 3 set seal envelope , one stratum ( i.e. , trauma hemorrhage , sepsis , diagnosis ) . To randomise patient , investigator must use first available seal envelope ( accord allocation number ) corresponding ( i.e. , trauma hemorrhage , sepsis , diagnosis ) . - Choice stratum : patient one diagnosis , choice stratum must follow : trauma haemorrhage &gt; sepsis &gt; others . For example , patient trauma sepsis randomise `` trauma `` stratum . - An envelope must use . - Investigators must declare fax ( coordinate centre ) inclusion within 2 work day , provide follow information : FOLLOW UP From H0 ( time randomisation ) H24 : - Total amount type fluid infuse - Number red cell unit - Mean mean arterial pressure hourly interval H0 H24 - PaO2/FiO2 ratio H0 , H12 H24 - SOFA score - PT time , ( bad value ) - Plasma total protein albumin level - Adverse event ( cf . supra ) Daily Day-1 ICU discharge : - Patient 's status : dead alive - Total amount type fluid infuse - SOFA score - Number red cell unit - Surgical procedure - Specialised radiographic procedure - Adverse event ( cf . supra ) - Chest X-ray score ( annexe 6 ) weight Day-1 day-2 At ICU discharge : - Alive date death - Length ICU stay - Time mechanical ventilation - Omega score 1,2,3 total ( annexe 8 [ 14 ] ) - Number type adverse event ( cf . supra ) - Where patient discharge : home , another ward hospital , another hospital , rehabilitation centre , home disable people At hospital discharge ( ICU discharge ) : - Alive date death - Length hospital stay - Where patient discharge : home , another ward hospital , another hospital , rehabilitation centre , home disable people SAMPLE SIZE This study design show absolute difference 5 % 28-day mortality colloid crystalloids . Assuming mortality rate 20 % crystalloids group , alpha = 5 % beta = 10 % , 1504 patient per treatment arm need . A total 3010 patient enrol . All randomised patient must follow ( least ) till ICU discharge . One hundred active centre recruit Europe . The participation centre around 3 6 month . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Interim analyse stop rule The boundary sequential plan draw demonstrate absolute difference 5 % 28-day mortality rate two treatment arm , assume 20 % mortality rate crystalloids group , alpha beta 5 % 10 % respectively . The analysis perform every 100 death . The figure display boundary sequential plan . Briefly , Z represent difference two group V number patient include . When boundary cross , enrollment study must stop , conclusion depend boundary crossed ( see figure ) . Simulations allow estimate many inclusion save : difference mortality rate nil , 1109 patient include reach conclusion . When difference 5 % , 1477 patient include reach conclusion . Final analysis The final analysis perform accord intention treat principle , inclusion study stop . Baseline characteristic patient compare two treatment arm : categorical variable express number percentage compare Chi-2 test , mean , standard deviation , range give continuous variable , compare Student test . Methods analyse efficacy safety depend type outcome . Survival curve construct accord Kaplan-Meyer method , compare log-rank test . The comparison adjust main prognosis variable Cox model . Categorical variable compare Chi-2 test , continuous variable Student test analysis variance repeat measure .
