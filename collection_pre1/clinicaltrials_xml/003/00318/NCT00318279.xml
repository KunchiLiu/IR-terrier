	<brief_title>Evaluation Surgical Simulator Practicing Vascular Anastomosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For many year , surgical training consider apprenticeship , training experience resident , real operative setting live patient . We propose study demonstrate – low-fidelity simulation aorta-proximal vein graft anastomosis heart bypass surgery , use anatomical replicates ( special hydrogel polymer property similar human vascular tissue ) – effective , low-cost simulator learn surgical skill , provide trainee ability perform good anastomosis short period time . Hypothesis : Practicing aorto-saphenous vein anastomosis low-fidelity surgical simulator advance trainee ’ learn curve . This allow trainee produce high quality anastomosis short period time , group learn watch video lead enhance patient safety .</detailed_description>
