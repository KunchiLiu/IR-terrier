	<brief_summary>McCune-Albright syndrome ( MAS ) syndrome cause genetic mutation cause specific protein body call G protein constantly active . Children McCune-Albright syndrome classically early puberty , area increase skin pigmentation , bone lesion result constant activity specific protein involve . Histamines know play role allergy relate allergic problem . The effect histamine control G protein overly active McCune-Albright syndrome . Thus , one could predict patient McCune-Albright may high risk allergic problem . To date , study document form histamine excess allergic difficulty patient McCune-Albright syndrome . However , investigator make observation high percentage patient MAS exhibit range allergic symptom , mild symptom , severe , life-threatening symptom . The purpose study demonstrate increase histamine response use histamine skin test patient MAS . If increase reaction histamine document MAS patient compare control , severe potentially life threaten allergic reaction child MAS could anticipate avoid .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives study determine : 1 . Patients McCune-Albright syndrome differ unaffected control wheal flare response histamine codeine . 2 . Affected skin differ unaffected skin wheal flare response histamine codeine . 3 . IgE IL-4 level MAS patient differ normal control . Specific Aims : 1 . Compare skin response MAS patient normal control use standard histamine codeine skin test . 2 . Compare skin test response MAS patient know standard skin test . Compare response histamine codeine skin test MAS patient ’ affect ( café-au-lait ) skin unaffected ( normal ) skin . 3 . Compare IgE IL-4 level patient MAS control . Background : The McCune-Albright syndrome ( MAS ) genetic disorder characterize constitutive activation Gαs proteins involve adenylyl cyclase enzyme . The disease know cause genetic mutation , commonly substitution histadine cysteine arginine amino acid 201 Gαs protein . Adenylyl cyclase , formation cyclic AMP ( cAMP ) , work second messenger many cellular hormonal event . Clinically , MAS characterize classically precocious puberty , café-au-lait skin marking , bone lesion term polyostotic fibrous dysplasia . Other condition represent overactivity receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase include hyperthyroidism result activation TSH receptor , hypercortisolism ( CRH ACTH receptor activation ) , acromegaly ( GHRH receptor activation ) , among others . Clinical heterozygosity affect individual explain mosaicism mutation . The H2 histamine receptor also couple Gαs protein . Release histamine mast cell primarily responsible immediate hypersensitivity reaction skin . Clinical observation patient MAS suggest increase responsiveness histamine . We speculate result upregulation Gαs couple H2 receptor . In identified patient , manifest asthma , chronic hive , dermatographism , contact hypersensitivity , drug reaction , ulcer , well anaphylactic reaction seafood , dye , latex . Approximately 75 % patient MAS exhibit one aforementioned reaction . Anaphylaxis occur three separate patient . Interleukin-4 ( IL-4 ) also release immune cell response histamine . This cytokine response mediate H2 receptor activation activation Gαs . IL-4 required function production IgE , another important mediator hypersensitivity reaction . Two MAS patient allergy symptom additionally demonstrate markedly elevate IgE level . Codeine effective agent cause release histamine mast cell commonly use addition histamine . We plan use codeine well histamine skin test evaluate histamine response . Comparison codeine response MAS patient unaffected control make . Age sex exert major effect histamine responsiveness . Only infants adults age 50 note decreased responsiveness comparison age group . Menstrual cycle female note cause slight variation increase dermal reactivity around ovulation low reactivity menses . Because girls McCune-Albright irregular menses difficult time skin test menstrual cycle . Therefore , record date last menstrual period female patient control . Excessive histamine responsiveness report association MAS complex . Even though data available , MAS patient could predict risk vigorous histamine response , histamine act via Gαs . Study Design : This single center control study histamine response child MAS compare unaffected subject . No investigational drug/device/biologic agent employ . Subject Selection Criteria : 1 . Expected sample size : 10 McCune-Albright patient 20 control . 2 . Patients recruit study endocrinology clinic visit . Most patient MAS see least every 6 month . Families patient MAS tend medically sophisticated , MAS severe , chronic , multisystem disease . We estimate least 80 % 13-14 known patient consent participate . A control group also recruit . 3 . Inclusion criterion : Children MAS range toddler young adult . Diagnosis MAS make clinical basis . Blood test helpful condition , bone marrow progenitor cell Gαs mutation display survival disadvantage . All patient mixed chimera , mutation lethal occur germline cell . Patients exhibit two follow clinical finding fit diagnosis MAS : 1 . GnRH independent precocious puberty 2 . Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia 3 . Café-au-lait spot Coast Maine border respect midline . 4 . Non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism . Ten control also recruit family member patient MAS know allergy . An additional control group ten unrelated subject , also know allergy , recruit Endocrine Clinic comparison . 4 . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Any MAS patient control discontinue home regimen antihistamine glucocorticoid ( include inhale steroid ) least seven day prior skin test . 2 . Any MAS patient control tricyclic antidepressant within two week prior skin test . Study Groups : No specific treatment investigate study . Observations/Measurements : Patients ask discontinue usual home regimen antihistamine and/or glucocorticoid seven day prior skin test . First participant undergo single blood draw obtain level IgE IL-4 . We utilize commercially available ELISA kit human IL-4 . We publish extensively use ELISA method . Quantitative IgE level perform lab . Children MAS control undergo standard pin-prick skin testing procedure dilution histamine , codeine , saline control solution ass skin wheal flare response order objectively assess hypersensitivity and/or responsiveness . Skin test specifically involve place drop histamine solution skin surface . A needle penetrate gently epidermis . The procedure use codeine saline . Tests space least 2 cm apart avoid false reaction . Testing include two standard site skin test , i.e . arm back , participant . An area skin café-au-lait formation normal skin counterpart test patient MAS . The normal control undergo skin test matched area . Testing perform Allergy Clinic train allergy fellow attending . Wheal flare response document 20 minute skin test administer . The wheal flare response outline ink , image transfer hypoallergenic transparent tape place data collection sheet measurement . The long orthogonal erythema diameter measure sum . Sum wheal diameter determine similar manner . Previous study show standard wheal flare response yield sum 7.0 cm ± 1.25 cm . After test complete , participant give dose antihistamine ( Zyrtec ) topical calamine lotion pin prick area decrease irritation . There careful monitoring extreme hypersensitivity anaphylaxis usual standard care test child allergy . However , classic systemic allergic reaction cause protein allergen . As histamine codeine protein compound , systemic allergic reaction would expect . An epinephrine pen hand use unusual reaction occur . Significance : Currently literature state child McCune-Albright syndrome display increase responsiveness histamine . If study show MAS patient indeed increase histamine responsiveness , risk severe allergic reaction could anticipate . Life threaten event could potentially avert MAS patient carry epinephrine pen and/or treat patient antihistamine . Power analysis : A publish report standard wheal flare responses histamine demonstrates sum long ( A ) orthogonal ( B ) ( determine midpoint A , label X ) [ Σ =A+B ] diameter wheal flare response histamine 7.0 cm ± 1.25 cm . ( mean ± S.D . ) Assuming McCune-Albright patient display mean wheal flare response 50 % great diameter compare control , use alpha level 0.05 ; test 10 patient provide 84 % power detect difference patient control .</detailed_description>
