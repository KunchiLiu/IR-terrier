	<detailed_description>Introduction : Spinal cord injure ( SCI ) constitute large group patient suffer neurogenic bladder dysfunction , often manage intermittent catheterization ( IC ) . Intermittent catheterization accept safe effective method maintain bladder renal health individual neurogenic bladder dysfunction . However , IC several time day place individual risk urethral trauma , hematuria , particularly symptomatic urinary tract infection ( UTI ) . Attempts control UTI prophylactic antibiotic sterile technique overly successful recent advance catheter technology , hydrophilic-coated catheter , offer potential benefit . The hydrophilic-coated catheter slippery , pre-lubricated surface ( along entire length catheter ) soak water , allow smooth insertion without need additional water soluble lubricant . Two propose advantage uncoated catheter 1 ) reduce incidence symptomatic UTI , 2 ) reduction urethral irritation urethral trauma , lower risk urethral stricture . Currently , trend favour hydrophilic-coated catheter respect UTI overall evidence remain inadequate clinical decision-making choice catheter type . Randomised trial date limit short follow , heterogeneity , attrition , imprecise outcome measure , vary definition UTI5 . Conclusions Cochrane group 20076 echoed recent comprehensive re-view study hydrophilic-coated catheter - modest evidence favour hydrophilic-coated catheter reduction UTI , robust research require .</detailed_description>
