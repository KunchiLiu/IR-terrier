	<detailed_description>OPC Factor , food supplement contain grape seed extract , pine bark extract , vitamins mineral , show clinical observation effect raise energy level people age 45-65 . It believe mechanism action base enhanced production ATP mitochondrion . In study subject assign chance either active product group placebo group . Subjects take product three week .
