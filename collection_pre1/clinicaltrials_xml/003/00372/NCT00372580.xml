	<brief_summary>Psoriasis chronic inflammatory skin disease characterize formation scaly erythematous plaque . A Th1-cell mediated process believe involved pathogenesis psoriasis . It mainly detect Th1 cytokine profile serum tissue . Epidemiologic study also show significantly decrease incidence atopic dermatitis . According Th1 Th2 dogma , psoriasis atopic dermatitis two mutually exclusive dermatosis . However , simple dichotomy Th1 Th2 pathogenesis psoriasis atopic dermatitis may overly simplistic.1 . Recent genetic study suggest strike overlap genetic locus psoriasis atopic dermatitis . In fact , atopic dermatitis psoriasis share genetic similarity atopic dermatitis asthma . 2 . It indeed , difficult find patient typical atopic dermatitis psoriasis . However , asthma rarely encountered psoriasis . And asthma one hallmark diagnosis atopic dermatitis . 3 . The cytokine profile long-standing atopic dermatitis shift Th1 profile . A mixed Th1 Th2 chemokine profile present atopic dermatitis . Scratch result Th1 infiltrate animal model . 4 . Patients erythrodermic psoriasis high percentage elevate IgE level . And tissue peripheral eosinophilia might present . 5 . Eczema known precipitate factor psoriasis . Areas atopic dermatitis childhood may serve koebernizing loci future development psoriasis . And adulthood , since main pathologic event asthma aerorespiratory tract , presence Th2 cytokine profile seemingly affect build Th1 profile skin psoriasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Atopic Diathesis Assessed Serum Th1/Th2 Cytokine Profile Clinical Manifestation Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It suggest psoriasis homogeneous disease . It constellation diseases share similar pathologic finding . Clinical distinct entity psoriasis include pustular psoriasis , guttate psoriasis , psoriasis vulgaris , erythrodermic psoriasis , inverse psoraisis , sebopsoriasis . Recent study also show different cytokine profile small large plaque psoriasis . It also suggest thickness psoriatic plaque also genetically pre-determined . In daily practice , nummular/eczematous ( thin plaque ) , inverse erythrodermic psoriasis seem common presence asthma/atopy history . The present study design find influence atopic diathess phenotypic manifestation psoriasis . In absence typical atopic eczema lesion patient psoriasis , Th2 cytokine profile serum IgE level well personal family history atopy ( i.e . asthma , allergic rhinitis , hay fever , atopic dermatitis ) presence degree itch also assay correlated clinical manifestation . At least one hundred consecutive psoriatic patient without atopic diathesis recruit . The definition variant psoriasis psoriasis vulgaris follow : 1 . Pustular psoriasis : lesion show clinical pustular main form , exclude pustular transformation secondary treatment.2 . Erythodermic psoriasis : thin plaque cover 90 % BSA worst least 50 % see study3 . Inverse psoriasis : psoriasis mainly large skin fold , include groin , breast , foreskin , interdigital ( psoriasis alba ) subauricular area . 4 . Sebopsoriasis : lesion mainly confine seborrheic area , i.e . scalp , ear , retroauricular fold , glabella , eyebrows , nasal fold , presternal intersscapular area . Lesions confine scalp exclude . 5 . Guttate psoriasis : acute onset multiple lesion usually wider 1 cm6 . Nummular psoriasis : discoid thin plaque ( PSAI : thickness mostly 1 ) , usually 4-5 cm wide , somewhat exudative surface sometimes annular preferentially locate limb . In case uncertainty , pathology perform make diagnosis enrollment . 7 . Thin plaque psoriasis : similar psoriasis vulgaris , thickness individual plaque grade 2 PASI except elbow , knee scalp . 8 . Small plaque psoriasis : similar guttate psoriasis plaque large ( 1-5 cm ) chronic course.9 . Other psoriasis : include figurate erythema like psoriasis , psoriasis unguium , etc .</detailed_description>
