	<brief_title>Nordic Study Effects Growth Hormone ( Norditropin SimpleXx ) Treatment Adults With Prader-Willi Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE ( S ) : Prader Willi syndrome ( PWS ) multi-symptomatic genetic disorder associate abnormality growth hormone ( GH ) -insulin-like-growth factor ( IGF ) -I axis body composition . GH treatment register indication child PWS , improve growth rate body composition . One pilot study adult patient clinical PWS show beneficial effect body composition without simultaneous significant side effect . The aim present study evaluate effect GH treatment body composition , muscle function quality life PWS adult . TRIAL DESIGN : The study investigator initiate investigator sponsor multinational multi-centre trial , include centre Norway , Sweden Denmark . Within centre patient randomise ( double blind ) one year treatment daily injection GH placebo ( efficacy ) , follow two year observation period GH treatment ( safety ) . TRIAL POPULATION : Twenty patient centre include study . The patient need genetically verify diagnosis 18 40 year old . Patients exclude GH treatment give within last two year , malignancy serious disease , particular severe respiratory disease . ASSESSMENTS : Effect evaluate primarily change body composition , activity daily live quality life . SAFETY : Before start study patient examine tonsillary hypertrophy sleep apnoea . Oral Glucose Tolerance Tests perform regularly . TRIAL PRODUCT ( S ) : During initial 4 week placebo-controlled study phase patient treat sc injection GH ( Norditropin Simplexx ) evening dose 0.3 mg/day respectively 0.4 mg/day BW 100 kg . Thereafter dose increase 0.6 mg/day ( 0.8 mg/day ) maintain fixed 11 month . During follow 24 month open phase dose individually titrate .</detailed_description>
