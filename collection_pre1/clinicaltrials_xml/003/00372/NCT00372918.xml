	<detailed_description>Throat symptom common complaint many patient . Some symptom think attributable laryngopharyngeal reflux ( i.e . reflux stomach acid level larynx ) . It unclear role laryngopharyngeal reflux ( LPR ) produce throat symptom relationship laryngeal pathology . LPR may carefully diagnose knowledge could obtain regard presence esophageal manifestation reflux stomach acid . Although LPR may occur absence esophageal manifestation , presence may make diagnosis probable . If , therapy carefully direct . Using flexible endoscope , otolaryngologists perform transnasal flexible laryngoscopy . This require topical anesthesia occur clinic setting . The small caliber transnasal esophagoscope develop recent year perform similar manner . It provide key information regard esophageal pathology . This obviate need administration anesthesia ( i.e . topical , non-sedating agent ) . Transnasal flexible laryngoscopy consider standard care evaluation larynx . Transnasal esophagoscopy extension standard care . There number study demonstrate safety utility transnasal esophagoscopy human . Typically study compose retrospectively select group patient . Additionally TNE finding review one medical discipline . This study first prospective analysis TNE finding review multidisciplinary manner ( i.e . otolaryngologist gastroenterologist ) .
