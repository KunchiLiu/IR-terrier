	<brief_title>Pilot Study Rituximab Treatment Acute Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura ( ITP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) autoimmune disease characterize severe thrombocytopenia bleeding . With current standard therapy , adult-onset ITP tend recur thus expose patient prolonged risk hemorrhage toxicity standard treatment . Rituximab , chimeric anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody , show effectively raise platelet count patient ITP clinical biological evidence suggest , give early , rituximab may prevent ITP relapse . We design randomize , double blind , placebo control pilot trial rituximab treatment non-splenectomized adult acute ITP receive standard treatment . The primary objective trial determine feasibility recruitment , randomization blinding ; safety rituximab ITP ; event rate control group use calculate sample size large trial . Secondary objective determine rate 6-month event free survival event define : platelet count &lt; 50 ; need rescue treatment ; significant bleeding . Data pilot trial inform design large phase III trial .</detailed_description>
