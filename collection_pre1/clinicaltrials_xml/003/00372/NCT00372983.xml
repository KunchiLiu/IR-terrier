	<brief_summary>The purpose research trial find whether NOV-205 well tolerate compare placebo ( salt water ) people hepatitis C. In addition , trial test NOV-205 absorb body single multiple dos trial drug , look early sign therapeutic activity ( decrease indicator blood hepatitis C virus liver damage ) . This know pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . NOV-205 experimental drug . `` Experimental '' mean trial drug currently test approved sale United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . However , NOV-205 approve Russian Federation treatment liver diseases include hepatitis C. Clinical study country show subject treat NOV-205 alone decrease indicator blood hepatitis C virus liver damage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety PK Study NOV-205 Treat Chronic HCV Who Fail Standard Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b trial aim evaluate pharmacokinetic profile NOV-205 , comparison placebo , identify early sign antiviral activity ( quantitative reduction &gt; 0.5 log10 serum HCV RNA level ( Elbeik , 2004 ) ) establish safety profile NOV-205 monotherapy subject chronic HCV non-responders treatment pegylated interferon plus ribavirin . This trial also explore effect NOV-205 serum biochemical marker liver damage ( e.g . alanine aminotransferase , ALT ) indication biologic activity . Results trial guide design future Phase 2 study NOV-205 chronic hepatitis C subject .</detailed_description>
