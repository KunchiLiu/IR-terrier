	<brief_summary>Acute myocardial infarction generally cause thrombotic occlusion coronary artery . Primary aim early therapy fast complete reperfusion infarcted myocardium , achieve either thrombolytic therapy primary PCI . Primary PCI facilitate flow target vessel restore prior intervention . In addition result recent trial hint clinical outcome improve patent infarct-vessel primary PCI . The CIPAMI-study analysis effect early administration Clopidogrel flow-rates subject suffer acute myocardial infarction . For purpose divide two group , receive standard baseline treatment . The subject one group additionally receive 600mg Clopidogrel , early possible , subject second group receive standard therapy . In second group Clopidogrel allow initial angiography . In group flow-rates PCI analyse compare order evaluate efficacy , feasibility , safety administration high load dose Clopidogrel early phase STEMI prehospital setting .</brief_summary>
