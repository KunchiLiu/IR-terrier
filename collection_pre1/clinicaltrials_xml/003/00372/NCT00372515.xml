	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study find use high dos drug Gefitinib ( Iressa ) way treat patient non-small cell lung cancer spread cover brain and/or spinal cord ( meninges ) result bad side effect ; determine high dose give patient set .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Dose Gefitinib Treatment Carcinomatous Meningitis Adult Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Known Suspected EGFR Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- The standard therapy type cancer give chemotherapy directly spinal fluid , usually spinal tap . Some chemotherapy may , case , combine radiation . This study look different way treat type cancer . - This study specifically patient whose lung cancer change protein call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . The study drug , gefitinib , develop stop signal EGFR tell certain type lung cancer tumor grow . By use high dos normally use , hope increase amount drug spinal fluid attempt kill cancer cell around spinal cord brain . - Since look high dose gefitinib give safely , everyone participates study receive amount drug . - Patients start take gefitinib daily mouth Day 1 continue take medication daily home . On first day patient take gefitinib Day 14 treatment cycle ( 1 cycle equal 28 day ) , patient undergo : Physical examination study doctor detail neurological exam neuro-oncologist ; sample cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) lumbar puncture ; review current medication ; measurement vital sign ; check patient ability perform daily activity ; blood work . - If patient tolerate study medication well , patient receive low dose day 15-28 cycle . - At end cycle Day 28 , patient meet study doctor follow : physical examination ; review current medication ; measurement vital sign , check patient ability perform daily activity ; blood test ; MRI brain spinal cord ass tumor response ; every two cycle CT scan chest abdomen assess tumor response .</detailed_description>
