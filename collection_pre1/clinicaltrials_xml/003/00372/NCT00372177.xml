	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) disease large economic impact due long last disable nature disease . Furthermore , diagnosis disease difficult scheme different symptom use diagnose rheumatoid arthritis , often probability . Due fact effective disease modify pharmacological treatment available start early establish case RA , combination adverse effect potential substance ( e.g . methotrexate ) , fast reliable diagnostic tool diagnose rheumatoid arthritis would highly appreciated medical community patient . Furthermore , invasive treatment ( surgery , puncture ) , image method display activity pattern different joint would major advantage . For evaluation effectiveness pharmacological therapy rheumatoid arthritis , , radiological measurement destruction process joint use . This method disadvantage time consume insofar change radiological image must occur . It allow evaluation joint destruct ( excluded new therapy regimen ) . Again , quantifiable method determination effect new therapeutic approach would highly appreciate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Anti-CD4 Monoclonal Antibody ( mAb ) -Fragment Imaging Chronic Inflammation Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The substance use iv injection due protein nature antibody , ensure fast distribution within body . The study perform open clinical trial due fact apply radiation document ; use `` placebo '' radiation would unethical . It expect , new antibody fragment radioactive linkage display image activity distribution disease . Due fact patient active disease image , allow comparison activity clinical distribution disease , proof concept study ( phase I study ) perform patient active disease . Healthy volunteer could display activity pattern disease . Furthermore , seem unethical use volunteer study radioactivity risk/benefit ratio ( radiation risk vs. miss chance display tissue distribution ) proof concept study .</detailed_description>
