	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . AEG35156 may help docetaxel work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose AEG35156 give together docetaxel treat patient locally advance , metastatic , recurrent solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose define recommend phase II dose AEG35156 combination docetaxel patient locally advance , metastatic , recurrent solid tumor . Secondary - Determine qualitative quantitative toxicity AEG35156 combination docetaxel give define duration reversibility toxicity . - Determine pharmacokinetic profile regimen . - Assess , preliminarily , antitumor activity regimen patient . - Assess pharmacodynamic effect AEG35156 X-linked inhibitor apoptosis level apoptosis peripheral blood mononuclear cell tumor tissue patient . - Evaluate M30/M65 cytokeratin 18 level ( marker apoptosis/necrosis epithelial tumor ) serum patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label , dose-escalation study AEG35156 . Patients receive AEG35156 IV 2 hour day -1 , 0 , 1 , 8 , 15 course 1 day 1 , 8 , 15 subsequent course . Patients also receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos AEG35156 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede ≥ 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Additional patient receive AEG35156 recommend phase II dose ( RPTD ) . Blood drawn periodically pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study . Samples examine flow cytometry , immunoenzyme method , reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction biological marker . Tumor tissue ( archival fresh ) collect patient treat RPTD examine immunohistochemical method biological marker analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week . Patients response stable disease ongoing follow every 3 month thereafter relapse/progression . Patients protocol-related toxicity also follow q 3 month resolution ≤ grade 2 . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
