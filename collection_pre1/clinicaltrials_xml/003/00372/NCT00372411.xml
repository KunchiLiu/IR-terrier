	<brief_title>Robotic Assisted Upper-Limb Neurorehabilitation Stroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Hypothesis : The primary hypothesis robotic training compare usual care intensive comparison therapy lead improve upper extremity function . Eligible patient randomize one three treatment arm : 1 ) usual care , 2 ) intensive comparison therapy , 3 ) robotic training . Participants assign intensive comparison therapy robot-assisted training receive treatment 12 week consist three one-hour session week usual care remainder follow-up . Those assigned usual care receive usual stroke care deliver participate medical center 36 week offer , compassionate care , choice either robot-assisted intensive comparison therapy . Secondary Hypothesis : The secondary hypothesis compare usual care intensive comparison therapy , robotic treatment lead improve quality life task performance involve proximal distal control paretic arm . If robotic arm effective , two secondary object evaluate early ( less 12 week ) late ( 36 week ) effect primary secondary outcome . Primary Outcome : The primary study outcome change Fugl-Meyer score neurological impairment 12 week relative baseline . Secondary Outcome : Secondary outcome include Stroke Impact Scale Wolf Motor Function Test . A cost-effectiveness analysis plan conduct robotic training effective usual care . Study Abstract : CSP # 558 randomize , multi-center , outpatient phase II trial ass safety efficacy robot-assisted therapy neurorehabilitation stroke patient moderate severe upper extremity impairment . The target sample 158 patient : 26 usual care , 66 intensive comparison therapy 66 robot training . This sample size provide 90 % power detect 5-point mean difference Fugl-Meyer scale robot train usual care 3-point mean difference robot train intensive comparison therapy . There one interim analysis primary endpoint 12 month purpose sample size re-estimation use adaptive design . The plan study duration 33 month 24 month intake nine month follow-up . IMPACT STATEMENT If robotic training prove beneficial provide functionally-oriented neurophysiologically appropriate therapy , also make widely available high-quality , evidence-based rehabilitative care time shortage experience therapist progressively grow rehabilitative need veteran Americans .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A single new focal unilateral stroke diagnosis verify brain imaging ( MRI ) CT scan occur least 6 month prior enrollment . Age 18 year age old . Upper extremity FuglMeyer score &gt; =7 &lt; =38 ( max 66 ) . ( These threshold include neither hemiplegic fully recover motor function 14 muscle shoulder , elbow , wrist . ) Cognitive function sufficient understand experiment follow instruction ( MiniMental Status Score 22 high interview aphasic subject ) . Willingness avoid new alternative arm rehabilitative approach duration study . Written inform consent participate study . A fixed contracture affect limb prevents movement along entire dynamic range require either robotassisted intensive comparison therapy . Joint pain occurs within range motion require intervention protocol ( intensive comparison therapy robotassisted therapy ) . Enrolled planning enroll another interventional research trial involve upper limb use procedure propose enhance limit function upper extremity ( adjuvant rehabilitation Botox injection ) 36 week participation . Prior experience robotassisted therapy intensive comparison therapy upper limb describe specific study . A complicate medical condition would prevent completion trial . Unable complete ninemonth study , e.g. , extend plan vacation . Any known preexisting bone disease might increase risk bone fracture injury intensive comparison therapy robotassisted therapy .</criteria>
