	<brief_title>Nasogastric Tube vs. Orogastric Feeding Tube Preterm Infants : Which Best ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm infant , even young 23 week gestational age , feed enterally first week life . Coordination suck swallowing , coordination breathe necessary efficient safe oral feeding , well establish 35th week gestational age . That tube feed essential preterm infant young age . There consensus regard best way feed tube , i.e . oral vs. nasal , whether place tube continuous intermittently . Nasogastric tube associate vagal response . Both tube may cause gastric perforation . Development function oral feeding described . It known non-nutritive suck early introduction oral feeding accelerate transition tube feed oral feeding . It suggest preterm infant may experience maturational lag vagal function relate ingestive need , may contribute continue feed difficulty may measurable marker subtle neurodevelopmental problem . Both oral nasal feed tube may interfere establishment efficient oral feeding . The purpose study see whether difference oral nasal tube feeding , regard institution oral feeding .</detailed_description>
