Following surgical resection , confirmation glioblastoma , patient proceed primary chemotherapy temozolomide ( temodar ) . Temodar give 42 consecutive day 14 day occur every 56 day . Procedures prior initial study treatment ( &lt; 14 Days ) : Neurological/Oncological History , Neurological Examination , Height , Weight , Body Surface Area , Performance Status , Quality Of Life FACT-BR , Labs , MGMT tissue analysis , Cranial CT/MRI without contrast . The procedure repeat Day 1 treatment cycle addition adverse event assessment . And study procedure patient performance status , Quality Of Life FACT-BR , MGMT tissue analysis , cranial CT/MRI without contrast . Patients may continue temodar daily dose therapy clinical neuroradiographical exam stable improving .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A single arm Phase 2 trial study drug temozolomide ( temodar ) newly diagnose glioblastoma elderly patient ( define great equal 70 year old ) . Temozolomide administer orally ( capsule ) approximately time daily ( bedtime ) 42 day 14 day ; cycle may repeat every 56 day . Complete blood count obtain bi-weekly , evaluation monthly MRI 's every 2 month cycle therapy . Procedures prior initial study treatment ( &lt; 14 Days ) : Neurological/Oncological History , Neurological Examination , Height , Weight , Body Surface Area , Performance Status , Quality Of Life FACT-BR , Labs , MGMT tissue analysis , Cranial CT/MRI without contrast ( disease find stag must follow use modality use Pre-treatment . Tumor assessment repeat every 56 day thereafter progression ) . The procedure repeat Day 1 treatment cycle addition adverse event assessment . Patients may continue therapy unless one follow occurs : - Documented clinical progressive disease time - Unacceptable toxicity - Treatment delay &gt; 2 week reason - Study data data indicate study treatment beneficial patient ; define least one response first 12 patient within tumor histology stratum - Non-compliance patient protocol requirement ( follow-up , treatment , administration disallow therapy ) - Changes medical status patient patient long meet eligibility requirement ( leptomeningeal spread , change mental competency ) investigator believe patient safety compromise . - Patient withdrawal consent treatment - Occurrence one toxic death Patients CR , PR , stable disease ( SD ) treat minimum 3 cycle [ 6 month ] disease progression . For patient respond treatment , continuation therapy beyond 3 cycle discretion investigator . Response parameter include MacDonald criterion evaluate brain tumor . Response measure reduction tumor size . After cessation protocol therapy , patient continue follow survival 2-month interval three year start treatment . And study procedure patient performance status , Quality Of Life FACT-BR , MGMT tissue analysis , cranial CT/MRI without contrast .</detailed_description>
