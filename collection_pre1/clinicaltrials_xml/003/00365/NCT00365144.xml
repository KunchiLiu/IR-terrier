	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth pancreatic cancer block blood flow tumor . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving bevacizumab together erlotinib may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together erlotinib work treat patient metastatic pancreatic cancer respond previous treatment gemcitabine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate 6-month overall survival rate patient gemcitabine hydrochloride-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer treat bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride . - Determine safety toxicity regimen patient . Secondary - Evaluate objective response rate patient . - Evaluate time tumor progression patient . - Determine efficacy regimen , term proportion patient ≥ 50 % decline carbohydrate antigen 19-9 , also call cancer antigen 19-9 ( CA19-9 ) biomarker , patient . - Obtain sequential measurement circulate tumor cell ( micrometastases ) endothelial cell serum correlate variable clinical outcome ( patient enrol UCSF site ) . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection baseline periodically study biomarker/laboratory analysis , include CA19-9 biomarker . Circulating tumor micrometastases endothelial cell also measure patient enrol University California San Francisco ( UCSF ) site . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day 6 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 40 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
