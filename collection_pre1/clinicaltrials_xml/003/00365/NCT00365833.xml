	<brief_title>CEC/EPC Cardiovascular Risk Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary disease one common cause morbidity mortality patient know chronic renal insufficiency end stage renal disease . Consequently , early detection marker circulate endothelial cell endothelial progenitor cell study order identify vascular function ass overall cardiovascular risk . Based current research , exist notable increase Circulating Endothelial Cells ( CEC ) reduction Endothelial Progenitor Cells ( EPC ) renal dysfunction due endothelial damage . Therefore circulate endothelial cell marker cardiovascular health . Renal transplant patient also possess high cardiovascular risk general population , know improvement survival compare patient ESRD ( End Stage Renal Disease ) . In addition , excellent outcome , graft patient survival even acute rejection longer useful endpoint clinical study . The tolerability transplant drug regimen impact regimes cardiovascular health kidney transplantation become , consequently , new focus research . Currently , clear long-term analysis fulfil analyze CEC EPC group patient . We hypothesize CEC serve biological marker cardiovascular risk assessment cadaveric living renal transplant patient . We eventually hope measurement cell serve endpoint determine cardiovascular outcome renal transplant patient . Our present study aim get initial assessment kinetics CEC EPC renal transplant recipient prior transplant first two year post transplant .</detailed_description>
