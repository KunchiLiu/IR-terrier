	<brief_title>Understanding Genetic Basis Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia Mexican Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CHD lead cause death Mexico . Dyslipidemia characterize high total cholesterol , high triglyceride , low `` good '' high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol risk factor develop CHD . Research show Mexican population increase tendency towards dyslipidemia , know genetic factor contribute predisposition . This study examine genetic basis FCHL , inherit form dyslipidemia characterize elevate level total cholesterol triglyceride . FCHL major contribute factor CHD ; 20 % individual CHD age 60 FCHL . The purpose study identify characterize specific DNA sequence variation predispose Mexican individual FCHL . Results study may aid development appropriate prevention screen technique . This study enroll individual Mexico FCHL . Participants attend one study visit blood collection DNA sampling . Family member participant contact asked provide DNA sample also . A select group participant return second study visit RNA sampling . Study researcher analyze participant ' DNA RNA sample , well two FCHL gene identify previous research study .</detailed_description>
