	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , Avastin ( bevacizumab ) , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving topotecan together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give topotecan together bevacizumab work treat patient stage IIIB stage IV non-small cell lung cancer respond previous systemic chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage IIIB Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Did Not Respond Previous Systemic Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine progression-free survival patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer treat topotecan hydrochloride bevacizumab fail prior systemic chemotherapy . Secondary - Determine objective response rate patient treated regimen . - Measure time-to-event efficacy variable , include time objective tumor response ( respond patient ) , duration response ( respond patient ) , time treatment failure , overall survival . - Characterize quantitative qualitative toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 Avastin ( bevacizumab ) IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 6 month registration .</detailed_description>
