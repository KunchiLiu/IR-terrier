	<brief_title>PXD101 Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Malignant Mesothelioma Chest That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine objective response rate patient unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) treat PXD101 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine overall survival time progression patient . II . Assess toxicity associate drug patient . III . Perform molecular correlative study tumor tissue ( optional ) peripheral blood ( require ) identify potential predictive marker response . OUTLINE : Patients receive PXD101 IV 30 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection course 1 treatment biomarker correlative study . Fetal hemoglobin ( hemoglobin F ) level measure via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction potential predictive marker response . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
