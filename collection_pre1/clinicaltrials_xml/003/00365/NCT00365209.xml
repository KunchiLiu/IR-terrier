	<brief_title>Phase II A Trial Curcumin Among Patients With Prevalent Subclinical Neoplastic Lesions ( Aberrant Crypt Foci )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine mean percentage change baseline prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) within ACF pre post 30 day curcumin administration specify dose . SECONDARY OBJECTIVS : I . To determine mean percentage change baseline 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid ( 5-HETE ) within ACF pre post 30 day curcumin administration specify dose . II . To determine mean percentage change baseline PGE2 5-HETE within comparison normal mucosa pre post 30 day curcumin administration specify dose . III . To quantify correspond enzyme change cyclooxygenase ( COX-1 , COX-2 , ) lipoxygenase ( 5-LOX ) protein abundance . Semi-quantitative change protein measure western blotting correlate change prostaglandin leukotrienes respectively . IV . Document change total ACF number . V. Determine proliferation Ki-67 IHC rectal mucosa pre post therapy correlate change ACF number size . VI . Determine curcumin concentration rectal mucosa 30 day therapy correlate PGE2 5-HETE change describe . VII . Measure glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) activity within colon pre post therapy indirect marker reduce oxidative stress within colonic epithelium . VIII . Ensure safety participant course study investigation . IX . Determine curcumin concentration plasma treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter , nonrandomized , uncontrolled study . Patients receive 1 2 dos oral curcumin daily . Treatment continue 30 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Blood tissue biopsy obtain sigmoidoscopy colonoscopy baseline day 30 correlative biomarker study . The change prostaglandin E_2 ( PGE_2 ) assess enzyme immunoassay , 5-hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid ( 5-HETE ) high-performance liquid chromatography , cyclooxygenase ( COX-1 COX-2 ) 5-lipoxygenase ( 5-LOX ) western blotting , Ki-67 immunohistochemistry , glutathione peroxidase ( GPx ) spectrophotometric assay . After completion study therapy , patient follow 1 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 48 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
