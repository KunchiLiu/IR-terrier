	<brief_summary>Bevacizumab angiogenesis inhibitor mean work stop blood vessel formation tumor . Without new blood vessel , growth tumor slow . Chemotherapy drug kill cancer cell directly . This study evaluate : - How bevacizumab , give chemotherapy surgery , bevacizumab give alone surgery , affect locally advanced breast tumor - Side effect add bevacizumab chemotherapy - Whether add bevacizumab chemotherapy breast cancer affect heart - If receive bevacizumab effect patient recover surgery - Side effect combination drug use study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Therapy With Bevacizumab ( BEV ) , Doxorubicin , Cyclophosphamide Followed BEV , Docetaxel , Capecitabine Before Surgery Followed BEV Alone After Surgery Women With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Initial trial neoadjuvant chemotherapy administer locally advanced tumor , include breast cancer , demonstrate therapy could induce sufficient tumor regression allow resection otherwise unresectable tumor . Subsequent demonstration equivalence lumpectomy mastectomy patient operable breast cancer , stimulate interest concept use preoperative chemotherapy reduce large , operable , primary tumor allow lumpectomy woman would otherwise require mastectomy . Given data previous study , appropriate continue development sequential doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide/docetaxel regimen improve clinical pathologic response rate . FB-4 Phase II , single arm study woman locally advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -negative breast cancer diagnose core needle biopsy . The primary aim study determine pathologic complete response rate breast follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy combine bevacizumab .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must female . The patient must great than/equal 18 year old The diagnosis invasive adenocarcinoma breast must make core needle biopsy limit incisional biopsy . Patients must clinical Stage IIIA , IIIB , IIIC disease ( American Joint Committee Cancer [ AJCC ] stag criterion ) primary breast tumor great than/equal 2.0 cm measure clinical exam , unless patient inflammatory breast carcinoma , case measurable disease require . Patients must ability swallow oral medication . The patient 's Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status must 0 1 . At time study entry , blood count must meet following criterion : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) must great than/equal 1200/mm3 . Platelet count must great than/equal 100,000/mm^3 . Hemoglobin must great than/equal 10 g/dL . The following criterion evidence adequate hepatic function must meet : total bilirubin must less than/equal upper limit normal ( ULN ) lab unless patient grade 1 bilirubin elevation ( great ULN 1.5 x ULN ) due Gilbert 's disease similar syndrome involve slow conjugation bilirubin ; alkaline phosphatase must less 2.5 x ULN lab ; aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) must less than/equal 1.5 x ULN lab . Alkaline phosphatase AST may great ULN . For example , alkaline phosphatase great ULN less than/equal 2.5 x ULN , AST must less than/equal ULN . If AST great ULN less than/equal 1.5 x ULN , alkaline phosphatase must less than/equal ULN . Patients either skeletal pain alkaline phosphatase great ULN less than/equal 2.5 x ULN eligible inclusion study bone scan positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan demonstrate metastatic disease . Patients suspicious finding bone scan PET scan eligible suspicious finding confirm benign xray , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , biopsy . Patients AST alkaline phosphatase great ULN eligible inclusion study liver image ( compute tomography [ CT ] , MRI , PET scan ) demonstrate metastatic disease adequate hepatic function . The following criterion evidence adequate renal function must meet : Serum creatinine less than/equal ULN lab . Calculated creatinine clearance must great 50 mL/min . Urine protein/creatinine ( UPC ) ratio must less 1.0 . Patients must leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) assess multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram within 3 month prior study entry . The LVEF must great than/equal low limit normal ( LLN ) cardiac image facility perform MUGA scan echocardiogram . Note : If cardiac imaging facility provide LLN , use 50 % LLN value . Note : Since preentry LVEF serve baseline compare subsequent LVEF assessment determine bevacizumab therapy continue follow doxorubicin cyclophosphamide ( AC ) postoperatively , critical baseline study accurate assessment patient 's LVEF . If baseline LVEF great 65 % , MUGA scan echocardiogram must repeat prior study entry . The low two LVEF value use baseline LVEF . Patients must electrocardiogram ( EKG ) within 3 month prior study entry . Tumor determine strongly HER2positive immunohistochemistry ( 3+ ) fluorescent situ hybridization ( positive gene amplification ) . Excisional biopsy primary tumor . Synchronous bilateral invasive breast cancer . Surgical axillary staging procedure prior study entry ( Exceptions : 1 ) fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) axillary node permit patient , 2 ) although recommend , sentinel lymph node biopsy patient clinically negative axillary node permit . ) History follow cancer : Ipsilateral breast cancer : invasive , ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) treat therapy excision Contralateral breast cancer : invasive within past 5 year ( Patients history DCIS synchronous DCIS eligible ) History nonbreast malignancy within 5 year prior study entry . Patients follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within previous 5 year : carcinoma situ cervix , carcinoma situ colon , melanoma situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . Prior therapy anthracyclines , taxanes , capecitabine , bevacizumab malignancy . Treatment include radiation therapy , chemotherapy , biotherapy , and/or hormonal therapy administer currently diagnose breast cancer prior study entry . The exception hormonal therapy , may give total 28 day anytime diagnosis study entry . In case , hormonal therapy must stop study entry restart , indicate , follow chemotherapy . Any following cardiac condition : angina pectoris require use antianginal medication ; history document congestive heart failure ; serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication ; severe conduction abnormality ; valvular disease document cardiac function compromise ; uncontrolled hypertension define blood pressure great 150/90 antihypertensive therapy . ( Patients hypertension well control medication eligible . ) History myocardial infarction document elevated cardiac enzyme persistent regional wall abnormality assessment leave ventricular ( LV ) function . History transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) . History arterial thrombotic event within 12 month study entry . Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease . Any significant bleeding within 6 month study entry . Serious nonhealing wound , skin ulcer , bone fracture . Gastroduodenal ulcer ( ) determine endoscopy active . Invasive procedure define follow : Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior plan start study therapy . ( Note : Placement vascular access device consider major surgical procedure . ) Anticipation need major surgical procedure ( require breast surgery ) course study . Known bleed diathesis coagulopathy . ( Patients warfarin inrange international normalize ratio [ INR ] [ usually 2 3 ] eligible . ) Other nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , diabetes , etc . ) would preclude patient receive study treatment would prevent require followup . Sensory/motor neuropathy great than/equal grade 2 , define NCI 's Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events Version 3.0 ( CTCAE v3.0 ) . Conditions would prohibit administration corticosteroid . History hypersensitivity reaction drug formulate polysorbate 80 . Therapy hormonal agent raloxifene , tamoxifen , selective estrogen receptor modulator ( SERM ) , either osteoporosis breast cancer prevention . Patients eligible medication discontinue prior study entry . Any sex hormonal therapy , e.g. , birth control pill , ovarian hormonal replacement therapy , etc . These patient eligible therapy discontinue prior study entry .
