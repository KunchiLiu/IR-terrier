	<brief_title>MR Guided Focused Ultrasound Treatment Uterine Fibroids With Enhanced Sonication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Uterine leiomyoma ( fibroid ) common neoplasms female pelvis . These benign tumor generally oval shape , often highly vascular . On T2 weight MR image exam , T1 exams contrast , uterine fibroid easily identifiable . They occur 20-25 % woman reproductive age cause variety problem generally describe either bleed mass effect fibroid . InSightec develop Enhanced Sonication ( ES ) technique ablation fibroid . This mode tissue ablation add already FDA approve ExAblate system . The goal ES technique provide additional treatment tool enhance treatment effect without additional risk preserve ALL clinical feature current commercially approve version .</detailed_description>
