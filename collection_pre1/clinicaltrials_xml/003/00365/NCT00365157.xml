	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Cancer Urothelium Kidney Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish whether E7389 ( eribulin mesylate ) give safely patient moderate severe renal dysfunction 1.4 mg/m^2/week ( maximum tolerate dose [ MTD ] previously define patient normal renal function ) day 1 8 21-day cycle . ( Phase I ) II . To characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile E7389 patient moderate severe renal dysfunction . ( Phase I ) III . To determine response rate patient advance urothelial carcinoma E7389 first-line setting . ( Phase II ) IV . To determine 6-month , progression-free survival overall survival patient advance urothelial carcinoma treat E7389 . ( Phase II ) V. To document toxicity associate administration E7389 patient advance urothelial carcinoma patient vary degree renal dysfunction . ( Phase II ) VI . To determine response rate patient advance urothelial carcinoma E7389 set progression prior platinum-based chemotherapy advance recurrent disease , two cohort : tubulin-inhibitor treat tubulin-inhibitor na√Øve . ( Tubulin inhibitor common use urothelial cancer include paclitaxel , docetaxel vinblastine ) . ( Phase II ) VII . To determine 6-month progression-free survival overall survival patient advance urothelial carcinoma treat E7389 platinum-based therapy recurrent advance disease . ( Phase II ) VIII . To document toxicity associate administration E7389 patient advance urothelial carcinoma patient second line later set . ( Phase II ) IX . To compare men woman advance bladder cancer treat E7389 respect toxicity E7389 classify Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version ( v ) 4 ( ) hematologic toxicity , ( ii ) non- hematologic toxicity , ( iii ) frequently observe toxicity ( neutropenia , anemia , leucopenia , infection ) . ( Enrollment additional female ) X . To compare men woman advance bladder cancer treat E7389 respect response E7389 evidenced ( ) disease control rate ( DCR ) define stable disease ( SD ) +partial response ( PR ) +complete response ( CR ) 12 week , ( ii ) progression-free survival ( PFS ) , ( iii ) overall survival ( OS ) . ( Enrollment additional female ) XI . To compare men woman advance bladder cancer treat E7389 respect pharmacokinetics E7389 . ( Enrollment additional female ) XII . To compare men woman advance bladder cancer treat E7389 respect tumoral expression gene involve mechanism action E7389 , include tubulin isotypes , microtubule-associated protein 4 ( MAP4 ) , stathmin . ( Enrollment additional female ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 minute day 1 8 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 12 month every 3 month 24 month .</detailed_description>
