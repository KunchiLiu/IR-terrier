	<detailed_description>In study , participant stratify accord HER2 status time enrollment . HER2-negative participant randomize 1:1 ratio either stratum 1 ( AC- &gt; T sequential + bevacizumab ) stratum 2 ( TAC + bevacizumab ) . All HER2-positive participant assign stratum 3 ( TCH + bevacizumab ) . The study include treatment period 1 year , follow 2 year posttreatment survival follow-up period .</detailed_description>
