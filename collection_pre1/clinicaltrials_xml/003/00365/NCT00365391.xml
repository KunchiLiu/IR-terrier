	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together erlotinib work treat patient advanced liver cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bevacizumab erlotinib may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving bevacizumab together erlotinib may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate objective response rate patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma treat bevacizumab erlotinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate time progression patient treat regimen . II . Evaluate overall progression-free survival patient treat regimen . III . Evaluate adverse event patient treat regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine presence epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation tumor tissue correlate response rate , progression , survival patient treat regimen . II . Evaluate expression molecule involve EGFR signal transduction , include EGFR , phosphorylated-EGFR , Akt , phosphorylated-Akt , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , phosphorylated-MAPK , HER2/neu immunohistochemistry ( tumor tissue ) correlate patient outcome measure . III . Determine level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGF receptor tumor tissue well baseline plasma VEGF level correlate patient outcome measure . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo laboratory study determine epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) phosphorylated-EGFR protein level use initial diagnostic biopsy specimen immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) correlation clinical outcome . Levels proteins EGFR signal , include Akt , phosphorylated-Akt , mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) , phosphorylated-MAPK , also determine use initial diagnostic biopsy specimen IHC correlate clinical outcome . Total free serum vascular endothelial growth factor level determine start study prior course 3 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
