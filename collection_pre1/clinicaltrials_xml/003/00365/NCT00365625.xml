	<brief_summary>The stepwise process leukocyte extravasation inflame tissue depend expression variety cytokine adhesion molecule . Recently much attention focus Junctional Adhesion Molecules ( JAM ) . The three member adhesion molecule family , namely , JAM-A , -B -C , show govern last step leukocyte extravasation ( transmigration ) - process leukocytes pass endothelial cell . In addition transmigration , member family seem support additional step leukocyte extravasation cascade . The investigator recently show , antibody-mediated inhibition JAM-C significantly reduce hapten induced skin inflammation ( J Invest Dermatol ; 125 ( 5 ) :969 ) . Recent unpublished work laboratory show , JAM-C expression lymphocytes up-regulated specific activator . Hence , investigator hypothesize , JAM-C expression elevate patient psoriasis . As currently know , factor may influence expression JAM-C , investigator intend analyse JAM-C expression CD3+CD41- cell several time-points treatment psoriatic patient . Expression JAM-C correlate disease activity ( PASI ) .</brief_summary>
