	<brief_title>Use Magnetic Imaging Asses Efficacy Cap Assisted Colonoscopy Reducing Looping Improving Patient Acceptance Colonoscopy Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy widely use investigation lower gastrointestinal tract disease.However , colonoscopy remain technically difficult procedure . As colon mobile organ , loop may occur colonoscope pass through.Hence , reduce looping procedure improtant achieve succes well patient acceptance.Recently , study show cap-assisted colonoscopy ( CAC ) allow good visualisation colonic fold , thus increase success rate.However , previous study show magnetic endoscope imaging ( MEI ) useful adjunct assist endoscopist perform procedure modality look mechanism looping . Because concern , study compare mechanism loop formation acceptance CAC regular colonoscopy MEI .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient undergo first colonoscopy examination Signed informed consent Patient receive colonoscopy examination .
