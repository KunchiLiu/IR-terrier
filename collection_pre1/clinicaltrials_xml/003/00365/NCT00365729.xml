	<brief_summary>Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -infection belongs common sexually transmitted disease worldwide . HIV-infected men sex men ( MSM ) strongly associate high prevalence genital HPV-infection , high incidence anal intraepithelial neoplasia ( AIN ) , , consecutively , increase risk anal cancer . Since introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , incidence several viral-associated neoplasia significantly fall HIV-infected individual . At begin era HAART , justify hope exist genitoanal HPV-related neoplasia would also decrease base success HAART-induced immune restoration . However , HAART seem small impact natural history AIN observe cohort HIV-positive MSM initiation HAART . As AIN cancer precursor lesion cervix , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia , share distinct clinical similarity , cytologic smear test AIN recommend detect treat early lesion . Thus , prospective study mainly focus predictive value HPV-DNA load development clinical progression AIN HIV-infected MSM . Moreover , course HPV viral load therapy anal intraepithelial neoplasia , e.g . topical treatment imiquimod , evaluate . Additionally , immunohistochemical determination several proliferative biomarkers , well cytokine , perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Compared general population incidence anal intraepithelial neoplasia ( AIN ) anal carcinoma ( AC ) amongst men sex men ( MSM ) extremely high ( 70/100,000 ) . While many opportunistic infection decline since introduction highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) , incidence AC fallen . In contrast , HAART-related improvement survival seem result increase risk AC HIV-infected MSM . Screening cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) cervical cytology early treatment result significant decline incidence cervical carcinoma . Like cervical cancer , AC may preventable identification treatment precursor . Nevertheless , never effort implement anal cytology screen program HIV-infected MSM . Persistent cervical infection high-risk HPV-types indicative development CIN cervical cancer . As prevalence genital HPV-infections HIV-infected woman men high ( &gt; 90 % ) , predictive value qualitative HPV-DNA detection limit cervical cancer AC prevention . However , several study show number HPV-DNA copy cervical scrape may predictive severity underlie cervical dysplasia . Thus , prospective study mainly focus predictive value HPV-DNA load development clinical progression AIN HIV-infected MSM . Besides , HPV-E6/E7-oncogen-expression use RT-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) determine . Moreover , course HPV viral load therapy anal intraepithelial neoplasia , e.g . topical treatment imiquimod , evaluate . Additionally , immunohistochemical determination several proliferative biomarkers well cytokine perform .</detailed_description>
