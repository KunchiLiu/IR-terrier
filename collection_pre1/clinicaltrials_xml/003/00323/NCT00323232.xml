	<brief_summary>Although Standard Care Hip Fractures Device ( Dynamic Hip Screw ) study project , size ( 2 4 hole version ) currently use widespread agreement yet whether optimal number screw ( 2 4 ) require best outcomes . If show 2 hole version successful outcomes would allow small incision ( surgical cut ) site fracture . This could reduce soft tissue dissection , operate time , surgical blood loss . This turn would reduce post operative pain , blood loss , hospital length stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Treatment Outcomes Hip Fractures Surgically Fixed With Either Two Four Hole Device .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design prospectively evaluate clinical result two-hole versus four-hole dynamic hip screw treatment intertrochanteric fracture . It estimate 27,000 hip fracture occur Canada year , estimate cost $ 10,000 per patient per hospitalization . Intertrochanteric hip fracture account approximately half hip fracture . While many surgical treatment option exist , accepted standard fixation device treatment stable unstable intertrochanteric hip fracture dynamic hip screw . No consensus exist regard optimal number screw require adequate side plate fixation treatment intertrochanteric fracture . The commonly used device 135-degree four-hole side plate , however , decrease length side plate would theoretically allow small incision site , minimal soft-tissue dissection , shorten operating time , reduce operative blood loss . This turn would reduce post-operative pain , blood loss , length hospital stay . With majority hip fracture occur frail , elderly population , less invasive procedure potentially decrease overall patient mortality . Biomechanical study simulate stable unstable intertrochanteric fracture suggest few screw adequate good side plate fixation . Two clinical trial review series fracture treat two-hole DHS report favorable result . No prospective randomize study date , however , directly compare clinical result standard four-hole plate two-hole plate . We propose study evaluate clinical result two-hole versus four-hole plate treatment intertrochanteric fracture minimum 6-month follow-up . This study 's aim develop clinical outcome data use ( ) determine range expect clinical outcome result current standard management injury , ( b ) basis report clinical outcome injuries peer-reviewed literature . Patients age 65 sustain isolated 2- , 3- , 4-part intertrochanteric hip fracture include study . Patients Pathological , subtrochanteric , reverse obliquity fracture , multiple injury , patient whose time operate room exceed 48 hour exclude . The primary outcome measure assess mechanical failure fixation . Secondary variable assess hospital stay : length incision , post-operative pain , analgesic use , operative time , mean hemoglobin drop . Length hospital stay medical complication also assess . They subsequently follow six week , 3 month , six month post-operatively clinic physical exam pelvis hip radiograph , inquiry make general medical condition significant medical complication since discharge . A functional inquiry quality life score administer pre-operatively subsequent clinic visit .</detailed_description>
