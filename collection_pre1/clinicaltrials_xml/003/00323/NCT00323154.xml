	<brief_title>Nalbuphine Treatment Opioid Induced Pruritus Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PURPOSE Primary To determine efficacy nalbuphine ( 50 - 100 mcg/kg intravenously ) treatment opioid induce pruritus multi-center tertiary care pediatric patient population . Secondary Determine effect treatment nalbuphine subject analgesia level sedation . HYPOTHESIS Primary Outcome : Nalbuphine effective treatment opioid induce pruritus ; 50 % reduction pruritus intensity consider clinically significant . Secondary Outcome : Treatment nalbuphine result attenuation analgesia increase sedation JUSTIFICATION Itch frequent disturb side effect opioid use . A recent internal review pediatric pain service University Alberta Hospital , Edmonton , Alberta find 40 % incidence pruritus patient receive opioids . A similar review British Columbia Children 's Hospital demonstrate 22 % patient incidence pruritus . OBJECTIVES The compare efficacy nalbuphine placebo treatment opioid-induced pruritus . It anticipate nalbuphine result great 50 % reduction pruritus intensity . RESEARCH METHOD This study randomize , double-blinded , placebo control trial nalbuphine treatment opioid-induced pruritus . Pruritus intensity measure use standardized assessment tool / Color Analog Scale ( CAS ) . This metric scale use quantify pruritus scale zero ten . Using scale score zero represent white , increase pruritus severity represent darker shade color red , along ruler . Data analysis base intenton treat . It multi-center study involve tertiary care center acute pediatric pain service . Subjects divide two group computer generate block randomization ; one group receive treatment nalbuphine receive placebo . The patient investigator blind treatment administer . REASON FOR PLACEBO CONTROLLED STUDY DESIGN Current first line therapy opioid induce pruritus , diphenhydramine associate low efficacy ( 33 % ) ( 1 ) . Recognizing 30 % self report response placebo , felt conduct study placebo-controlled trial necessary demonstration significant improvement pruritus intensity .</detailed_description>
