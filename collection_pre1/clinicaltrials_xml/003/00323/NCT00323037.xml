	<brief_title>A Study Compare Effects Coreg CR Coreg IR Heart Function Subjects With Stable Chronic Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Results clinical trial show beta-blockers improve symptom leave ventricular function , reduce hospitalization death heart failure , prolong survival [ MERIT-HF , CIBIS-II , Packer , 1996 ] . Clinical guideline mandate use beta-blockers treatment subject heart failure . Carvedilol ( Coreg IR ) multiple action adrenergic receptor blocker alpha 1 , beta 1 beta 2 receptor blockade property . The beta-adrenergic property non-selective beta 1 beta 2 adrenergic receptor . Coreg IR , administer twice daily , market United States long term treatment mild-moderate hypertension , mild severe heart failure subject survive acute myocardial infarction leave ventricular dysfunction without symptomatic heart failure . Coreg IR significantly reduce cause mortality need cardiovascular hospitalization [ Packer , 1996a ; Packer , 1996b ; Colucci , 1996 ; Cohn , 1997 ; Olsen , 1995 ; Sharpe 1997 ] . The effect Coreg dose dependent [ Bristow , 1996 ] . In subject treat long term acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) complicate left ventricular systolic dysfunction , Coreg IR reduce frequency all-cause cardiovascular mortality , recurrent non-fatal MIs . These beneficial effect additional evidence-based treatment acute MI , include ACE inhibitor [ Dargie , 2001 ] . Left Ventricular End Systolic Volume Index ( LVESVI ) important measure ventricular function remodel evaluation heart failure . In controlled clinical trial , Coreg IR , administer twice daily , reduce LVESVI subject ischemic heart failure . An echocardiography substudy Australia-New Zealand Trial [ Doughty , 1997 ] , evaluate leave ventricular remodel 123 subject ischemic heart failure LVEF &lt; 45 randomized carvedilol placebo . The LVESVI reduce 6.2 + 1.6 ml/m2 6 month 8.7 + 2.6 ml/m2 12 month carvedilol therapy compare placebo treated subject . Metra et al [ Metra , 2000 ] observe favorable effect carvedilol compare metoprolol LVEF , LV stroke volume , pulmonary artery pressure despite similar effect cardiovascular outcome . Both group also show significant decrease LV systolic volume . Doughty et al [ Doughty , 2004 ] observe favorable effect carvedilol LV remodeling , improve LV end-systolic volume ejection fraction , 6 month treatment . Carvedilol phosphate CR ( Coreg CR ) approve , modify release , once-daily formulation carvedilol hop provide advance patient care improve compliance prescribe dose . The clinical experience various formulation Coreg CR limit eight single dose study healthy subject one repeat dose study subject hypertension . In total 230 , adult subject receive least one dose Coreg IR one several CR formulation across nine study . The subject range age 18 63 year ; 62 % male 69 % white . The various formulation Coreg CR capsule safe well tolerate single dose pharmacokinetic study dose range 6.25 60 mg healthy subject . The common adverse event headache , dizziness orthostatic hypotension know adverse event follow administration Coreg IR [ GSK Study 386 , 388 , 399 , 400 , 402 , 907 ] . This study first control clinical study investigate efficacy treatment Coreg CR formulation [ Coreg CR fill 7.5 mg carvedilol phosphate immediate release ( IRp ) microparticles , 22.5 mg carvedilol phosphate Micropump IIa MR microparticles , 30 mg carvedilol phosphate Micropump IIc MR microparticles ] compare Coreg IR evaluate LVESVI subject stable chronic heart failure .</detailed_description>
