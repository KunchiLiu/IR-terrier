	<brief_title>Five-year Actively Controlled Clinical Trial New Onset Juvenile Dermatomyositis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific objective : The propose project aim improve treatment approach rare , severe disable paediatric rheumatic disease ( PRD ) . This goal achieve Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation ( PRINTO ) international network whose main function provide scientific base current PRD treatment evidence base data exist literature , drug support industry . This 5-year project , involve 46 country ( 110 21 EU States 75 25 extra-EU States ) , randomise clinical trial ( RCT ) juvenile dermatomyositis ( JDM ) : 5-year phase III single-blind , RCT child newly diagnose JDM : prednisone ( PDN ) versus PDN plus methotrexate ( MTX ) versus PDN plus Cyclosporine A . The trial aim find treatment regimen associate low occurrence flare low drug relate toxicity . The retention treatment use main measure effectiveness . Methodology : The present protocol natural follow previous work conduct PRINTO . In particular RCT foreseen protocol model successful completion early phase trial MTX juvenile idiopathic arthritis , use validate JDM outcome measure evaluation response therapy . It basic premise protocol , without ) involvement international paediatric rheumatology community , ii ) innovative type mechanism describe herein , study would never conduct . Objectives . The goal current protocol therefore natural follow-up objective achieve previous grant , particular , project design discern new model successful conduct clinical trial child rare disease , develop standardize validated measure evaluation response therapy JDM . The propose trial JDM ( prednisone [ PDN ] versus PDN plus methotrexate [ MTX ] versus PDN plus cyclosporine [ CsA ] ) , serve model successful run early phase clinical trial severe disable rare disease childhood . The ultimate aim trial provide evidence-based information clinical utility drug management rare paediatric condition .</detailed_description>
