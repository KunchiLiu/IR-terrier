	<brief_summary>The purpose research study study type gene therapy treatment call plasmid electroporation . This type treatment involve injection gene melanoma tumor locate near surface skin , follow burst electricity tumor cause tumor take gene . This study Phase I study determine side effect correct dose type treatment also effectiveness treat melanoma . While electroporation technique use people , combination plasmid injection electroporation try human being first time .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must cytologically/histologically document metastatic malignant melanoma lesion near skin would accessible electroporation Fine Needle Aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy . Age &gt; 18 year old Patients must ECOG performance status 02 Patients may prior chemotherapy immunotherapy ( vaccine Interferon IL2 ) progression persistent disease . All chemotherapy immunotherapy must stop 4 week prior electroporation . Patients may radiation therapy , must progressive disease radiation therapy lesion electroporated within radiation field . In addition , must least 2 week since administration radiation therapy sign toxicity must abate . Patients must able give informed consent able follow guideline give study Patients must minimum two eligible tumor may four eligible tumor treat electroporation . Patients may prior therapy IL12 prior genetic therapy Patients must evidence significant active infection ( e.g. , pneumonia , cellulitis , wound abscess , etc . ) time study entry . Patients must adequate renal normal hepatic function ( creatinine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , bilirubin SGOT ( AST ) within institutional normal limit ) obtain within 4 week prior registration . Patients must absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1500/mm^3 platelet count &gt; 100,000 /mm^3 within 4 week prior registration . Pregnant breast feed woman exclude study effect fetus unknown may risk increase fetal wastage . Women childbearing age must negative pregnancy test willing use highly effective method contraception . Men sexually active must also willing use accept effective method contraception . Patients electronic pacemaker defibrillator exclude study effect electroporation device unknown . Patients significant cardiac arrhythmia 's ( include ventricular tachycardia , ventricular fibrillation WPW syndrome ) also exclude . Patients history epilepsy exclude unless seizure free last 5 year think low risk seizure neurologist . Tumors invade bone , major blood vessel nerve ineligible tumor contraindication use electroporation .</criteria>
