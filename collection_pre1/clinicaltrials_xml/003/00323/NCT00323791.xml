	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving gemcitabine together imatinib mesylate may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study gemcitabine imatinib mesylate see well work compare gemcitabine alone treat patient metastatic unresectable kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine With Without Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare stable disease objective response patient metastatic unresectable renal cell carcinoma treat gemcitabine hydrochloride without imatinib mesylate . Secondary - Evaluate median survival , progression-free survival , response rate patient treat gemcitabine hydrochloride imatinib mesylate . - Determine qualitative quantitative toxic effect regimen patient . - Determine expression c-KIT platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha protein expression tumor cell associate endothelial cell use immunohistochemistry stain paraffin-embedded tissue . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify histology ( clear cell v nonclear cell ) prior therapy ( immunotherapy/chemotherapy v target agent ) . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 3 10 oral imatinib mesylate day 1-5 8-12 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve partial complete response 2 course treatment continue treatment gemcitabine hydrochloride imatinib mesylate absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable disease 2 course treatment randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 3 10 . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 3 10 oral imatinib mesylate day 1-5 8-12 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day least 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Available archived tumor tissue sample obtain immunohistochemical analysis quantify expression c-KIT platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha protein expression . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 100 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
