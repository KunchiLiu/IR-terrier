	<brief_title>Very Low Protein Diet Renal Death Chronic Kidney Disease ( CKD ) -ERIKA Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence chronic dialysis patient increase worldwide rise incidence end stage renal disease , burden high cardiovascular risk , associate high morbidity mortality determine enormous cost community . The improvement management metabolic cardiovascular complication associate chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) since early stage disease becomes mandatory order delay start dialysis ameliorate whole patient outcome . Dietary protein restriction represent basic therapeutic approach CKD , reduce accumulation nitrogen catabolic substance , phosphorus retention consequent hyperparathyroidism , metabolic acidosis , salt intake consequent hypertension , proteinuria , improve anemia glycemic tolerance , effect low protein diet renal failure progression rate definitely demonstrate . Dietary effective reduction 0.2 g/kg/day protein effective ameliorate blood urea nitrogen , metabolic acidosis hyperphosphoremia , low protein diet ( VLPD ) allow improve metabolic control uremia , safe , affect nutritional status , cost saving . VLPD suggest delay start renal replacement therapy respect standard low protein diet , mean either secondary analysis clinical trial retrospective analysis . Large randomize clinical trial ( RCT ) issue lack , effect VLPD renal death remain addressed . As well , information patient ' compliance VLPD prescription impact VLPD quality life need . Finally , also effect VLPD cardiovascular risk factor mortality remain completely evaluate . The primary aim study evaluate , mean RCT , effect low protein diet renal death renal patient affect chronic renal insufficiency moderate advanced degree ( CKD stag 4 5 ) . Secondary aim evaluate effect VLPD cardiovascular risk factor , morbidity mortality , adherence VLPD , relationship VLPD quality life .</detailed_description>
