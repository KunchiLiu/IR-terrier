	<brief_summary>This study people colorectal cancer , tumor completely remove surgery . Blood clot problem patient cancer . Blood clot also problem patient receive cancer drug . Studies show 17 % patient receive cancer drug experience blood-clotting problem . One purpose study find drug combination irinotecan , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , bevacizumab leucovorin ( LV ) affect blood-clotting factor . A second purpose study find effect drug dalteparin clot factor blood patient receive drug combination irinotecan , 5-FU , bevacizumab LV . It hop add dalteparin chemotherapy may benefit patient colorectal cancer prevent blood clot</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients histologically cytologically confirm metastatic recurrent colorectal tumor previous treatment advance disease . Age &gt; 18 year ( dose toxicity data currently available use 5FU/CPT11 + bevacizumab + dalteparin patient &lt; 18 year age ) . SWOG performance status 01 . Patients must adequate organ marrow function define , test perform seven day prior first study drug administration : leukocytes &gt; 3.0 , absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/ml , platelet &gt; 100 X 109 L , total bilirubin &lt; upper normal institutional limit , AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( &lt; 5x upper normal institutional limit case liver metastasis , alkaline phosphatase &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( &lt; 5x upper normal institutional limit case liver metastases &lt; 10x upper normal institutional limit case bone disease , Serum creatinine &lt; 1.6 mg/dL OR Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 40 mL/min/1.73 m2 , PT , PTT , within normal range , Urine protein/creatinine ratio &lt; 1.0 At least one measurable lesion accord RECIST criterion irradiate ( i.e . newly arise lesion previously irradiate area accept ) . Ascites , pleural effusion , bone metastasis consider measurable . Minimum indicator lesion size : &gt; 10 mm measure spiral CT &gt; 20mm measure conventional technique . The effect chemotherapy develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry , duration study participation 30 day date last study drug administration ( postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential ) . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent prior studyspecific screening procedure , understand patient right withdraw study time , without prejudice . Have negative serum pregnancy test within 7 day prior initiation chemotherapy ( female patient childbearing potential ) . Life expectancy least 12 week . Fully recovered surgical procedure Lactating woman unwilling stop breast feed duration study participation 30 day date last study drug administration History allergy chemotherapeutics antiemetic appropriate administration conjunction protocoldirected chemotherapy . Prior unanticipated severe reaction fluoropyrimidine therapy , know hypersensitivity 5fluorouracil , know DPD deficiency . Serious , uncontrolled , intercurrent infection ( ) illnesses include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia . Treatment carcinoma within last five year , except cure nonmelanoma skin treat insitu cervical cancer . Current , recent ( within 4 week first infusion study ) plan participation investigational drug study . Patients document DIC ( disseminate intravascular coagulation ) . Patients previous history bleed diathesis significant bleeding episode gastrointestinal bleeding CNS hemorrhage . Clinically significant cardiac disease ( e.g . congestive heart failure , symptomatic coronary artery disease cardiac arrhythmia well controlled medication ) within last 12 month . Presence central nervous system brain mets . Major surgery , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior Day 1 , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . Unwillingness participate inability comply protocol duration study . Minor surgical procedure , fine needle aspiration core biopsy within 7 day prior Day 1 . Blood pressure &gt; 150/100 mmHg .
