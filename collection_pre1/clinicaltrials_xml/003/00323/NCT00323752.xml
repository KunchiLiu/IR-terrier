	<brief_title>Recombinant Human Erythropoietin Compared Autologous Pre-Donation Prior Scoliosis Surgery Children .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The pre-operative autologous donation ( PAD ) program establish British Columbia 's Children 's Hospital 1988 decrease need homologous blood transfusion . It could alleviate constraint arise current expect future shortages homologous blood . But , primarily , introduction PAD driven concern blood borne disease . A patient 's blood generally consider safe blood . However , PAD program several shortcoming . Firstly , venous access blood withdrawal often difficult child . Secondly , PAD program British Columbia 's Children 's Hospital ( BCCH ) history considerable wastage . Approximately 50 % pre-donated blood discard . Thirdly , patient 's medical condition distance BCCH make participation program infeasible . Finally , even though donor recipient , PAD still susceptible bacterial contamination clerical error . For example , possible wrong blood , either homologous blood another patient 's autologous blood , may give PAD donor another patient . Wastage , cost , logistic challenge , safety concern drive interest alternative treatment scoliosis patient . Recombinant human erythropoietin ( rHuEpo ) hormone stimulate red cell production . This treatment use patient schedule scoliosis surgery since 1990 . However , part BCCH 's current practice . Study Objectives The purpose study establish whether rHuEpo effective PAD increase red cell mass prior surgery . Other benefit PAD program preoperative administration rHuEpo also compare . A pilot study 20 subject investigate whether gain PAD group different group treat rHuEpo.. Research Activities Females age 12 18 year schedule undergo correction idiopathic scoliosis posterior fusion enrol study . Subjects randomly assign either participate PAD program receive rHuEpo treatment . Subjects PAD group donate 1 unit blood -14 -7 day prior surgery . A dose 500 IU rHuEpo administer subcutaneously subject rHuEpo group -21 , -14 , -7 day prior surgery . The primary measure efficacy gain red cell mass group prior surgery . The proportion patient treatment group require transfusion well pre-operative , peri-operative post-operative risk compare . Thirty day discharge , survey administer gauge individual patient family acceptance treatment . Expected Results Among patient schedule scoliosis surgery , rHuEpo treatment significantly low rate transfusion . RHuEpo treatment may lead improved outcome , decrease length hospitalization . However , true significance project lie investigation rHuEpo treatment alternative PAD program safer accessible patient family .</detailed_description>
