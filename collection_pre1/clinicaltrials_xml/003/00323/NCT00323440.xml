	<brief_summary>Familial Mediterranean fever ( FMF ) genetic disease , cause mutation FMF gene , entitle MEFV . The disease characterize painful attack inflammation site line serous membrane ( e.g . abdominal pain cause inflammation peritoneum , serous membrane surround internal organ within abdomen ) . Continuous colchicine treatment prevents attack patient . The pathogenesis disease , lead attack colchicine help , question yet resolve . Elucidating role inflammatory proteins important step towards understand question . To date small number cytokine inflammatory protein study individually . We propose study large number protein RNA protein level address interaction effect colchicine expression . Blood sample draw consent patient remission , attack , without colchicine treatment . ( 20 patient category ) .Twenty healthy volunteer donate control blood sample study . RNA produce neutrophil , cytokine various protein ' RNA expression determine . Major express protein measure sample result analyze regard activity disease , MEFV mutation colchicine treatment status . The information obtain study may allow u determine sequence event associate FMF attack development , perhaps take u one step understand pathogenesis disease .</brief_summary>
