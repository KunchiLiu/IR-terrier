	<detailed_description>The primary purpose propose study evaluate feasibility efficacy tailor CBT standard pharmaceutical care ( CBT/SC ) reduce pain , disability , distress among person Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) relate pain condition . This entail : ( 1 ) evaluate feasibility , perceive credibility , participation adherence rate , satisfaction relate CBT , ( 2 ) conduct randomize controlled trial efficacy CBT relative education control/standard care ( ED/SC ) condition , ( 3 ) evaluate possible predictor treatment response include demographic , disease-relevant variable , cognitive functioning , motivation readiness adopt self-management approach MS-related pain . Research Design : A randomized mixed factorial control design employ CBT/SC compare EDSC . Repeated assessment key outcome domain occur pretreatment/baseline , 15 week ( post-treatment ) , 20 , 36 , 52 ( follow-up ) week . Methodology : Participants trial 124 person MS ( include veteran non-veterans ) report persistent MS-related pain ( e.g. , neuropathic pain , pain related muscle spasm , neuralgia ) least moderate intensity ( pain severity 4 great numeric rating scale ) despite optimal pharmacological management . Participants must least 21 year age able provide inform consent . Exclusion criterion include : ( 1 ) pending surgery interventional anesthesiological procedure pain , ( 2 ) currently psychotic actively suicidal homicidal , ( 3 ) current alcohol substance abuse dependence , ( 4 ) presence life threaten illness , ( 5 ) presence profound cognitive impairment render successful participation CBT ED impossible , ( 6 ) presence physical disability result inability attend treatment session and/or inability participate telephone intervention ( e.g. , severe dysarthria ) , ( 7 ) prior current psychological treatment chronic pain , ( 8 ) two documented exacerbation MS-related symptom past year , ( 9 ) current exacerbation symptom define sudden onset symptom within 24 hour period . CBT involve innovative treatment approach combine specific train relevant cognitive behavior skill target management pain negative impact pain . The application skills management coincident symptom MS ( e.g. , spasticity , fatigue , abnormal sensory experience ) also encourage . ED involve provision broad array educational material regard MS management , explicitly inform participant non-pharmacological strategy management pain . Both treatment involve seven 60 minute , outpatient individual treatment session offer every week , interspersed five , 30 minute individual telephone session ( one final face-to-face session 30 minute individual telephone session include ) provide psychologist support patient education treatment guide develop study . Participants randomly assign one two treatment arm : CBT/SC ED/SC . Recruitment rate , session adherence , dropout rate , participant ' rating comprehension , treatment credibility , treatment satisfaction adherence therapist recommendation use assess feasibility treatment recruitment method . Multiple standardized measure outcome domain interest obtain , include pain severity , disability , affective distress , quality life . The analysis primary secondary outcome measure ( summary measure pain intensity , pain-related disability , MS-related disability , emotional functioning ) repeat measure mixed effect model27 . The outcome variable model change follow-up visit relative baseline , baseline value include covariate model . Several possible predictor treatment adherence outcome examine , include participant demographic ( e.g. , age , gender , ethnicity ) , disease-relevant variable ( e.g.. , MS subtype , disease duration , disease severity , level cognitive functioning ) , outcome measure ( e.g. , pain severity , depressive symptom severity ) , measure motivation adoption self-management approach chronic pain .</detailed_description>
