	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving gemcitabine together imatinib mesylate may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together imatinib mesylate work treat patient recurrent metastatic non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Imatinib Mesylate Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate response rate patient recurrent metastatic non-small cell lung cancer treat gemcitabine hydrochloride imatinib mesylate . Secondary - Assess time progression patient treat regimen . - Assess overall survival 1-year survival patient treat regimen . - Assess toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , nonrandomized , uncontrolled , open-label study . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 3 10 oral imatinib mesylate daily day 1-5 8-12 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 53 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
