	<brief_summary>Multiple myeloma rare form malignancy neoplastic plasma cell accumulate bone marrow . Most malignant plasma cell continue produce immunoglobulin . The activity multiple myeloma therefore usually monitor easily serial measurement serum paraprotein level . Except patient receive donor bone marrow transplant , multiple myeloma remain incurable despite intensive chemotherapy . Its course typically mark period active disease alternate increasingly short remission . Interferons substance produce human cell response variety stimulus , viral infection . When give myeloma patient part maintenance treatment , interferon-alpha 2 b ( INTRONA ) show value prolong period remission . Until , INTRONA could give injection skin , three time week . Some patient experience flu-like symptom injection , particularly early maintenance therapy . This , well chronic fatigue even depression INTRONA induce may considerably reduce quality life myeloma patient interferon , much sometimes useful adjunct chemotherapy myeloma stop . Recently , new preparation interferon namely pegylated interferon ( PEG Intron ) become available . It advantage broken much slowly body therefore need give week . This minimise swing blood interferon level may responsible interferon side effect . The safety superior tolerability PEG Intron already demonstrate patient hepatitis C carry licence , myeloma patient . Here , propose study whether quality life side effect profile myeloma patient PEG Intron well compare Intron®A . In main study , consent eligible myeloma patient well establish INTRONA maintenance therapy least six week randomly allocate receive PEG Intron three month follow INTRONA 3 month , continue INTRONA 3 month follow PEG Intron 3 month . All patient monitor regularly side effect ask fill quality life questionnaire beginning ( i.e . receive first randomise treatment ) end study period ( i.e . 3 6 month ) . Initially , aim enrol 60 patient part study . In small sub-study involve 14 patient initially , propose investigate whether myeloma patient need take Intron®A side effect tolerate PEG Intron easily . Should tolerance PEG Intron also poor would stop interferon maintenance therapy altogether . However , PEG Intron find acceptable , intend switch patient back standard treatment end six week treatment PEG Intron ass whether become tolerant Intron®A intervening period . Patients monitor carefully side effect ask fill three quality life questionnaire ( 0 , 6 12 week ) .</brief_summary>
