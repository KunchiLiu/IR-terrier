	<brief_summary>Purpose : This study evaluate safety CHOP plus Alemtuzumab patient T/NK cell lymphomas CD-20 negative large B-cell lymphoma previous treatment . The biological response lymphoma cell immune system drug combination also measure patient , , therapy administration .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CHOP Campath-1H Previously Untreated Aggressive T/NK-Cell Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : The drug combination call CHOP , Cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) , Doxorubicin ( Adriamycin ) , Vincristine ( Oncovin ) , Prednisone ( Deltasone ) , use different type lymphoma many year . Researchers investigate therapy combine CHOP regimen improve outcome patient lymphoma . The current study combine CHOP alemtuzumab , monoclonal antibody use leukemia . Monoclonal antibody type immunotherapy use type cancer . They produce laboratory design target well bind cell carry specific protein . Alemtuzumab design target leukemia cell express specific protein . The specific protein recognize alemtuzumab CD52 antigen . This antigen , substance cause immune system create specific response , express normal B T cell , well abnormal T cell characteristic certain cancer . Alemtuzumab cause CD52 antigen bind B-cell lymphocyte . This study also assess theory alemtuzumab may increase effectiveness chemotherapy agent include CHOP regimen . Treatment : Patients study receive alemtuzumab CHOP . Alemtuzumab give injection skin CHOP administer intravenous infusion . Patients receive alemtuzumab alone first week study . An increase amount alemtuzumab give first week . If patient tolerate high amount alemtuzumab determine appropriate within one week , remove study . Once high dose alemtuzumab achieve , patient receive alemtuzumab CHOP every three week . This schedule repeat eight time . Several test exams give throughout study closely monitor patient . Treatments discontinue due disease growth unacceptable side effect .</detailed_description>
