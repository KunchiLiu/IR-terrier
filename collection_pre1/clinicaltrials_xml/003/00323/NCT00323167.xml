	<detailed_description>Two type genetic disease associate abnormal mucociliary clearance . The first type result defective ciliary function include primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) , also know Kartagener Syndrome . The second type result defective ion transportation include variant cystic fibrosis ( CF ) pseudohypoaldosteronism ( PHA ) . The clinical manifestation three disease overlap , current evaluation procedure inadequate accurate timely diagnosis . A delayed diagnosis , couple poorly define disease category , result sub-optimal treatment regimen . The purpose study well define clinical genetic feature PCD , variant CF , PHA develop improve diagnostic procedure . The study also compare prevalence age-related information among three disease classic CF . Outcomes study may lead improved clinical care novel therapeutic approach rare genetic disorder airway . Prior study entry , previous clinical data participant review ensure individual common variant asthma . In case , clinical evaluation ( sweat chloride testing , immunodeficiency test , high-resolution compute tomography scan ) may recommend . Eligible participant attend initial six-hour study visit similar standard diagnostic evaluation . The participant 's medical history review physical examination include height , weight , vital sign measurement . Respiratory culture , nasal sample , blood collect . Non-invasive technique use measure oxyhemoglobin saturation level airflow ; chest x-ray require none do last six month . If firm diagnosis PCD variant CF establish completion first study visit , participant may return additional visit . Salivary semen sample may collect individual . A sweat chloride test nasal potential difference test may also perform .</detailed_description>
