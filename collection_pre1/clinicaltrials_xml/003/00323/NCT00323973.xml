	<brief_title>Chagas Cardiomyopathy Bisoprolol Intervention Study : Charity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Chagas disease ( CD ) permanent threat almost quarter population Latin America . Although disease describe almost Central South America , clinical presentation epidemiological characteristic highly variable among different endemic zone ( 1,2 ) . A wide range prevalence rate also report suggest local difference transmission disease well differences vector reservoir ( 3 ) . Chagas cardiomyopathy ( CCM ) represent serious public health problem Latin American country , recent statistic provide World Health Organization indicate 100 million person exposed disease approximately 20 million currently infect ( 4 ) . Interestingly , addition natural infection focus , increase transmission associate blood transfusion also notice . These statistic consider underestimation real rate infection , likely due lack report highly endemic retired rural community . In country disease endemic Colombia , Venezuela Brazil , overall prevalence infection average 10 percent . However , highly endemic rural area rate range 25 75 percent ( 5 ) . Prevalence infection varies widely even city province within country variation climate , housing condition , public health measure , urbanization . The actual prevalence clinical Chagas disease number case fatalities largely unknown , mainly case report virtually nonexistent many area CD highly endemic . Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) late manifestation CD result structural abnormality extensive irreversible damage myocardium . Heart failure T. cruzi infect patient usually occur age 40 follow AV block ventricular aneurysm . However , CHF develop patient less 30 year old frequently associate aggressive myocarditis extremely poor prognosis ( 1 ) . The mortality attributable CD relate severity underlie heart disease . Very high mortality often find patient congestive heart failure ( 2 ) , however , mortality asymptomatic seropositive patient varies greatly geographic region , suggest factor may influence severity progression rate cardiac disease . It believe cardiac damage CD progress slowly steadily decade , subclinical myocarditis mild segmental abnormality conduction defect , severe ventricular structural abnormality , finally overt congestive heart failure sudden cardiac death . Besides poor prognosis CHF due Chagas disease , important estimate risk complication death patient infect T. cruzi . Unfortunately , clinical study address issue . Most T. cruzi infect patient mild clinical disease , however , percentage infect people develop detectable cardiac abnormality approximately 30 40 percent ( 3 ) , 20 percent develop symptomatic cardiac involvement ( 6 ) . Like CHF cause , CHF due CD respond digital , diuretic vasodilator therapy ( 7 ) . Additionally , study show angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor improve survival patient moderate severe CHF due CD ( 8 ) . In spite benefit patient non Chagas disease CHF , considerable uncertainty potential role ACE inhibitor patient CHF due Chagas disease . Captopril , ACE inhibitor , show reduce neurohormonal activation non lethal arrhythmias small number patient Chagas heart failure ( 8,9 ) . Another intervention currently include management CHF patient use b blocker . Observational study ( 10 ) well clinical trial ( 11,12 ) show b-blockers reduce morbidity mortality CHF patient . The effect b-blockers CHF patient study large scale clinical trial ( 13-19 ) . Apparently , cardiac sympathetic hyperstimulation initially help preserve ventricular function CHF patient , later , result increase risk cardiac arrhythmia sudden death ( 20 ) b-adrenoreceptor antagonism seem protect deleterious effect chronic sympathetic stimulation ( 21 ) . Moreover , b-blockers reduce heart rate , improve myocardial energetic balance lead less negative force-frequency relationship . These effect contribute benefit b-blocker therapy CHF patient . Clinical study Carvedilol , a1 non selective b-blocker , support beneficial effect b-adrenoceptor antagonism ( 18,19,23,24 ) . Results US CARVEDILOL COPERNICUS trial , suggest prognosis CHF may partly depend leave ventricular dysfunction improvement well sympathetic activity reduction ( 18,23 ) . However , additional data need define precisely relationships heart rate reduction , leave ventricular function improvement survival CHF patient . In study like CIBIS II MERIT HF , beneficial effect selective b- blocker morbidity mortality observe specially patient functional class II III . In COPERNICUS multicentric placebo control clinical trial Carvedilol , effect ascertain even patient functional class IV ( 23 ) , demonstrate patient CHF , independently functional class , receive b-blocker therapy . Current guideline management CHF strongly recommend use beta-blockade management CHF . However , benefit prove Chagas´ cardiomyopathy ( 25,26 ) . Nevertheless , reason believe beta-blockade beneficial patient . First , patient CHF due CD raise end-diastolic pressure associate low systemic blood pressure , lead low transmyocardial pressure gradient subendocardial ischemia . Therefore , reduction myocardial oxygen demand due beta-blockade could expect beneficial situation , even non ischemic CHF patient . Second reduction sudden cardiac death serious ventricular arrhythmia suggest anti arrhythmic effect important component beta-blockade . This anti-arrhythmic effect explicable anti-ischemic basis also blockade sympathetic activity , indeed increase patient Chagas cardiomyopathy . Third , prolong activation sympathetic nervous system accelerate progression heart failure , rate progression substantially decrease use pharmacological agent interfere sympathetic activity heart peripheral blood vessel . There clear evidence increase circulate beta-adrenergic antibody Chagas disease provide theoretical support use beta-adrenergic blockade group patient . Beta-blockers already proven beneficial CHF patient metoprolol , bisoprolol carvedilol , drug test 10.000 patient 20 placebo-controlled clinical trial enrol men woman systolic dysfunction due ischemia , hypertension dilate idiopathic cardiomyopathy . Bisoprolol beta-1 selective blocker high selectivity receptor , dose less 10 mg little effect beta-2 receptor . Bisoprolol first test CHF CIBIS I trial enrol 641 patient show improvement functional class , less hospitalization heart failure trend improve survival . The much large randomize CIBIS II assign 2647 patient class III IV HF LVEF low 40 percent bisoprolol placebo , patient also receive standard therapy diuretic ACE inhibitor . After average follow-up 1.4 year , trial prematurely stop benefit observe active treatment group : significant reduction total all-cause mortality ( 11.8 versus 17.3 percent ) independent severity cause HF . This benefit primarily due reduction SCD ( 3.6 versus 6.3 percent , p 0.001 ) , non-significant trend toward few death HF , significant 15 percent reduction hospital admission cause 30 percent reduction admission HF ( p 0.0001 ) . Considering beneficial effect beta-blockers patient mild severe CHF due ischemic non ischemic disease , data regard potential effect patient CHF due Chagas disease . Based aforementioned propose develop multi-center placebo control clinical trial evaluate effect Bisoprolol patient CHF due CD .
