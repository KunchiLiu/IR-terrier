	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Imatinib mesylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving gemcitabine together imatinib mesylate may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study gemcitabine imatinib mesylate see well work compare gemcitabine alone treat patient previously treat locally advanced metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine +/- Imatinib Mesylate , Patients w/Previously Treated Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare time progression patient previously treat locally advanced metastatic breast cancer treat gemcitabine hydrochloride v without imatinib mesylate . Secondary - Compare efficacy regimens patient . - Compare overall survival patient treat regimen . - Compare safety tolerability regimens patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter , open-label , randomize study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 3 10 . - Arm II : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV day 3 10 oral imatinib mesylate daily day 1-5 8-12 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
