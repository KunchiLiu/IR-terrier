Subjects chronic cough suspect related acid reflux doctor prescribe proton pump inhibitor medication enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serial Exhaled Breath pH Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acid reflux consider key contributor cough , particularly patient obstructive lung disease . However , diagnosis rely upon either responsiveness high dose twice daily administration proton pump inhibitor therapy 24 hour esophageal pH probe . This study design provide information development clinically useful diagnostic ( exhaled breath condensate pH ) identify contribution acid reflux cough . Exhaled breath condensate ( EBC ) pH well document reflect airway acidification . Acid reflux level hypopharynx , key common trigger acid reflux induce cough , acidify airway sufficiently identify EBC pH assay . The association low EBC pH immediately precede cough strongly suggest association cough airway acid event , even acidity prolong , acid reflux become highly suspect . This study examine ability EBC pH measurement prognose likelihood positive response acid blockade proton pump inhibitor therapy subject chronic cough .</detailed_description>
