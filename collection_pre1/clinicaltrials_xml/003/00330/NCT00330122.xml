	<brief_summary>The fracture wrist , affect distal end radius frequent , particular old subject and/or osteoporotic . Beside simple fracture treat mini-invasive surgical method , considerable number strong comminuted fracture method osteosynthesis prof completely satisfactory , especially osteoporotic bone . However , restitution anatomy remain principal concern surgeon eager ensure good functional result patient , proviso least aggressive possible method use . Until , use rather largely use external fixer bridge radiocarpal articulation maintain length radius , less associate another method internal osteosynthesis minimum . The major disadvantage kind assembly high rate neuroalgodystrophic syndrome wrist loss reduction , sometimes generator painful after-effects serious stiffen . These after-effects sometimes definitive disable occur among active people , fortiori touch dominant side . The recent alternative use external fixer use plat lock screw , affixed foreface radius , maintain length radius bridge articulation . Thus , kind osteosynthesis generate ligamentary distraction radiocarpal capsule , factor would prevalent release algodystrophy stiffen . On hand , method osteosynthesis invasive installation external fixer , require access foreface radius practise percutaneous way . At present , randomized comparative study , publish study comparative retrospective control , carry nonhomogeneous series fracture . The principal objective study evaluate interest lock plate maintenance radial length comminute fracture distal end radius . It prospective , multicentric , randomize study 2 parallel group carry patient 40 80 year hospitalize service Osseous Surgery . Patients : articular displace fracture low end radius strong metaphysar comminution ( group M3 M4 classification MEC ) important shorten radius , measure radio-ulnar index higher 4 mm compare opposite side . Are exclude articular explosion type E4 . The patient 40 year , autonomous active , able give assent participation clinical study include . Treatment . The first group patient would treat fore locked plate possibly associate pin . The immobilization would limit antibrachiopalmar splint 45 day . If , peroperatively , sufficient stability fracture obtain plate alone , complementary stabilization fixer prove necessary , case enter like failure stabilization lock plate . The second group patient would treat external radiocarpal fixer neutralization possibly associate internal osteosynthesis minimum ( percutaneous pin ) . The fixer would leave place 45 day . The reeducation would consist 2 group active mobilization finger begin , active reeducation wrist flexion/extension pronosupination start 45th day . About fifty patient include group , collection clinical radiographic result 21 day , 45 day , 3 month 6 month .</brief_summary>
