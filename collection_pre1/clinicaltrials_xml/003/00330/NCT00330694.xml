	<brief_summary>In course disease , patient Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) face mount mobility deficit , include difficulty walk , balance , posture transfer . This frequently lead ( fear ) fall , injury , loss independence , inactivity cause social isolation increase risk osteoporosis cardiovascular disease . These mobility deficit difficult treat drug neurosurgery . However , physiotherapy deem effective improve mobility deficit PD . Physiotherapy widely prescribe purpose Netherlands . Yet , efficiency current `` usual care '' physiotherapy question , two reason . First , referral process seem inadequate patient mainly refer neurologist often lack insight ( im- ) possibility physiotherapy PD . Consequently , patient real need physiotherapy always refer ( undertreatment ) , whereas others without real need ( overtreatment ) . Furthermore , therapists treat PD patient specifically trained treat patient . This surprising average therapist rarely treat two patient per year practice . Therefore , patient refer probably receive suboptimal treatment . The objective study evaluate whether efficiency physiotherapeutic care patient Parkinson 's disease improve , reduce cost , target two key element current care system : ) inadequate referral neurologist ; b ) suboptimal treatment physiotherapist . We expect optimal referral combine expert treatment increase efficiency , reflect increase health benefit patient equal reduced cost ' .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design In Cluster Randomised Trial , 16 cluster randomly allocate either network care ( 8 cluster alter organisation physiotherapeutic care ) usual care ( 8 cluster unchanged organisation physiotherapeutic care ) . Clusters form PD patient live community connect participate regional hospital 16 cluster . The health care intervention experimental group two element : ( ) improve quality referral neurologist ; ( b ) improve quality intervention physiotherapist . Brief description Network Care : In Network Care cluster , 5 7 motivated therapist select enroll regional ParkNet consequently train . Training focus correct use evidence-based guideline physiotherapy PD ( Keus et al , 2006 ) . This training consist 5-day competence-oriented course , web-based continue education support seminar , use PD specific electronic patient record . Neurologists inform indication referral physiotherapy . Improved communication neurologist ParkNet therapist initiate support . Following implementation health care change , PD patient attend neurological outpatient clinic individual hospital within cluster ask participate . During period 6 month , PD patient enrol study . Enrollees follow 6 month measure use quality physiotherapy , patient health benefit satisfaction , cost .</detailed_description>
