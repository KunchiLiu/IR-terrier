	<brief_summary>Gliomas one challenge tumor treat , area apparently normal brain contain microscopic deposit glioma cell ; indeed , occult cell know infiltrate several centimeter beyond clinically apparent lesion visualize standard computer tomography magnetic resonance imaging ( MR ) . Since feasible remove radiate large volume brain , important target visible tumor infiltrate region brain . However , due limit ability detect occult glioma cell , clinician currently add uniform margin 2 cm beyond visible abnormality , irradiate volume . Evidence , however , suggest glioma growth uniform - growth favor certain direction impede others . This mean important determine , patient , area high risk harbor occult cell . We propose address task learn gliomas grown , apply Machine Learning algorithms database image ( obtain use various advanced imaging technology : MRI , MRS , DTI , MET-PET ) previous glioma patient . Advances directly translate improvement patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Gliomas common primary brain tumor adult ; high-grade high level mortality . The standard treatment kill remove cancer cell . Of course , work surgeon radiologist find cell . Unfortunately , inevitably so-called `` occult '' cancer cell , find even today 's sophisticated imaging technique . This proposal propose technology predict location occult cell , learn growth pattern exhibit gliomas previous patient . We also develop software tool help practitioner researcher find gliomas similar current one , autonomously find tumor region within brain image , save radiologist time , perhaps help surgery .</detailed_description>
