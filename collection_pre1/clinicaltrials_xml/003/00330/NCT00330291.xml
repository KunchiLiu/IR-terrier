	<brief_summary>Xyrem ( sodium oxybate ) agent propensity improve slow wave sleep sleep efficiency . It FDA approve treat cataplexy ( drop attack ) associate narcolepsy ( sleep attack ) . It show safe effective agent deep , restorative slow wave sleep improves next day cataplexy attack tend occur . Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) psychiatric illness patient witness involve traumatic event . After event , nightmare , flashback , avoidance people place associate trauma hyperarousal occur incapacitate patient . One major part PTSD hyperarousal mark insomnia multiple awakening night . This resultant poor sleep compound use SSRI serotonergic antianxiety agent ( ie Zoloft ( sertraline ) ) first line therapy tend degrade slow wave , restorative sleep . Patients may respond SSRI treatment may fail remit continue sleep problem . PTSD patient often fail respond antihistamine ( Desyrel ( trazodone ) ) benzodiazepine GABA hypnotic agent ( Restoril ( temazepam ) ) continue poor , interrupted sleep . It possible Xyrem 's ability remarkably improve slow wave sleep may greatly help treatment refractory insomnia due PTSD . The author propose open-label study ( placebo ) 10 PTSD patient , fail usual PTSD treatment fail usual insomnia treatment particular give Xyrem addition current PTSD medication . The author wish determine Xyrem safe treatment optionin difficult-to-treat patient population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Xyrem Treatment Refractory Insomnia Due PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( placebo ) study see addition Xyrem subject 's PTSD medication regimen tolerate possibly improve insomnia . Subjects currently take least single psychotropic agent treatment PTSD , ( SSRI ) . Dosing stable least 4 week subject need report continue insomnia despite treatment . They must also fail least two insomnia augmentation separate drug class ( benzodiazepine ( temezapam , zolpidem , ect . ) , antihistime ( quetiapine , mirtazapine , trazadone , etc . ) , dopamine antagonist ( olanzapine , quetiapine , aripiprazole , etc . ) qualify refractory insomnia . Subjects complete consent process attend screen visit give MINI psychiatric diagnostic evaluation confirm PTSD , give Hamilton Anxiety , Hospital Anxiety &amp; Depression Scale , PCL-C , Fatigue Severity Scale , Epworth Sleepiness Scale , Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Inventory , SF-12 , sleep diary evaluation delineate current anxiety level ( secondary measure ) . Subjects offer consent study team contact primary provider retrieve past present record show refractory history lack substance abuse . Subjects undergo brief physical exam bloodwork sleep EEG order . Furthermore , urine drug screen use screen current misuse . If subject take sleep agent , appropriately wash ( taper per cusual clinical practice drug free 5 time drug 's half life ) prior sleep EEG prior Xyrem start . In clinical practice , Xyrem use warrant blood monitoring , EEGs EKGs per FDA . Assuming subject meet eligibility , start Xyrem per cataplexy dose guideline . Prior titration , 1-2 week washout sleep agent occur . Titration start 2.25g bedtime 4 hour later . This drug may flexibly increase 4.5g ( x2 dos ) base upon tolerability effectiveness . We escalate dose drug toleratedbut without efficacy . Dosing increased subjective sleep quantity/quality still report unchanged rating scale indicate minimal change . After screen visit 1 ( eligibility , medical safety determination , washout , sleep EEG ) subject return baseline Visit 2 start Xyrem . They see Visit 3 7 day treatment rating scale possible dose escalation 6g/d . They see Visit 4 14 day treatment rating scale possible dose escalation 7.5g/d . They see Visit 5 21 day treatment rating scale possible dose escalation 9g/d . They see Visit 6/termination 28 day treatment rating scale , physical exam , lab work , sleep EEG . Subjects call final safety follow one week later 12 week later . Again , liaison subject 's provider occur discus continuance Xyrem . If provider agrees , long term monitoring jurisdiction provider . If agreement NOT continue Xyrem , patient taper offer help find clinician comfortable drug . There major issue stop drug withdrawal point view build system time regard dependence use bed time . Insomnia likely return patient would go back usual treatment desire likely original level insomnia . Safety Measures The overall safety tolerability Xyrem assess throughout study adverse event recording , clinical laboratory test result physical exam . A Safety monitoring board consist PI two psychiatry attending University Hospital</detailed_description>
