	<brief_summary>Fruits vegetable rich variety flavonoid antioxidant property . These compound may partially responsible positive link find fruit vegetable intake high bone mineral density adult child . Several animal study show consumption onion ( rich quercetin ) , rutin ( quercetin glycoside ) resvatrol ( find red wine ) inhibit ovariectomy induced bone loss rat . One studied flavonoid respect bone health soy isoflavones . However , consumption soy product relatively low Western country . One hand , flavonoid hesperidin , find mostly oranges much abundant Western diet . Citrus juice consumption demonstrate prevent bone loss male orchidectomized rat specifically feed hesperidin show prevent bone loss ovariectomized mice rat . However , date clinical prove obtain benefits.Therefore aim study investigate effect hesperidin prevent bone loss postmenopausal woman . This study design 2-year , double blind , placebo-controlled , two arm , parallel group study . The primary outcome measure change bone mineral density ( BMD ) secondary outcome measure change bone resorption formation marker well body composition . The woman randomise consume 2 serving hesperidin-rich food food without hesperidin taste &amp; appearance ( placebo ) . Subjects undergo medical screening , anthropometry , physical activity , dietary assessment BMD randomisation placebo active group . Follow-up measurement make 3-month interval ( blood urine collection ) 6-month interval bone mineral density . Side effect also monitor visit .</brief_summary>
