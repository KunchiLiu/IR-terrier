	<brief_summary>The hypothesis salsalate therapy may effective safe method modulate inflammation metabolically-critical tissue thus reduce insulin resistance related complication . The objective study ( 1 ) determine whether salsalate therapy improve insulin resistance subject IGT change glucose area curve follow standard oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) ; ( 2 ) determine whether salsalate therapy reduces ) plasma level variety well establish inflammatory protein b ) mononuclear cell inflammatory activity provide evidence reduce systemic tissue inflammation , respectively ; ( 3 ) also determine whether salsalate therapy improve parameter cardiovascular disease risk , include feature metabolic syndrome ( fast glucose , triglyceride , HDL , blood pressure ) well endothelial dysfunction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent study demonstrate important role sub-acute , chronic inflammation development insulin resistance , type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2 DM ) cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . A broad body data indicate obesity high fat `` Western '' diet activate sub-acute inflammatory process fat liver tissue well mononuclear cell . The inflammatory mediator produce tissue cell promote development insulin resistance locally distant site skeletal muscle . These inflammatory mediator may also increase risk CVD . Work labs indicate Nuclear Factor-kappa B ( NF-kB ) , inflammatory master switch multitude proinflammatory gene pathway , activate fat liver obesity high fat diet . We also note similar NF-kB activation monocyte macrophage similar condition nutritional excess . It become evident salicylate inhibit NF-kB regulatory protein IKKB ( inhibitor Kappa B Kinase ) subsequently demonstrate ability downregulate NF-kB activation tissue animal . Moreover , inhibit IKKB/NF-kB pathway , salicylates appear ameliorate insulin resistance associate metabolic abnormality potentially provide new approach pharmacologic treatment T2 DM well individual condition impair glucose intolerance ( IGT ) prevent progression diabetes . Preliminary result two-week trail T2 DM patient indicate high-dose aspirin ( ASA , ~7g/day ) improve glucose metabolism associate risk factor . While important first step towards proof-of-principle , risk severe gastrointestinal bleeding associate high-dose ASA precludes broad use . Salicylate prodrug form salsalate ( Disalcid ) , much safe ASA ( irritate gastric mucosa alter bleed time ) . We conduct several preliminary short-term individual IGT T2 DM well obese insulin resistant subject demonstrate salsalate dos 3.5-4.5g/d provide similar blood salicylate level high dose ASA induces similar clinical metabolic benefit 2-4 week study duration . Therefore , vitro , animal human clinical study support concept inhibit IKKB/NF-kB pathway salsalate feasible approach reduce insulin resistance . This study fully characterize metabolic benefit high dose salsalate therapy .</detailed_description>
