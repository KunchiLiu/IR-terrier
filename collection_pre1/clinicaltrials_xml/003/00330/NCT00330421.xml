	<brief_title>Sorafenib Treating Patients With Soft Tissue Sarcomas ( Extremity Sarcoma Closed Entry 5/30/07 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine combine vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGF-R2 ) /platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGFR ) -beta inhibitor BAY 43-9006/ sorafenib decrease interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) soft tissue sarcoma . II . To investigate effect BAY 43-9006/sorafenib tumor blood flow , circulate endothelial cell , vascular density pericyte coverage . III . To characterize pharmacokinetics BAY 43-9006/sorafenib sarcoma patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity . II . Assess whether significant relationship systemic drug exposure drug-related toxicity biological effect . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients assign one two group ( group 1 close accrual 5/30/07 ) . GROUP I ( SARCOMAS OF THE EXTREMITY ) ( CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 5/30/07 ) : Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-14 . Patients undergo surgical resection tumor approximately day 15 . Once patient recover surgery ( radiotherapy indicate ) , patient demonstrate clinically pathologically significant response ( ≥ 25 % reduction tumor size ≥ 25 % necrosis surgical specimen ) may continue sorafenib maximum 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity discretion principal investigator . Biopsy tissue blood sample examine biomarkers interstitial fluid pressure ( IFP ) measure baseline immediately surgery . GROUP II ( METASTATIC OR INOPERABLE SARCOMAS ) : Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course . Patients respond stable disease may continue sorafenib absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Biopsy tissue blood sample examine biomarkers IFP measure baseline day 28 56 . In group , blood sample draw periodically pharmacological study . After completion study therapy , patient follow monthly study-related toxicity resolve discretion investigator .</detailed_description>
