	<detailed_description>High blood pressure global public health problem develop develop country include Pakistan . Various study conduct around world link salt intake variation blood pressure.However , definite conclusion lack exact role dietary salt salt-blood pressure relationship remain controversial . While clinical practice guideline recommend dietary salt restriction lower blood pressure , relationship salt blood pressure test Pakistani population . Therefore , efficacy dietary salt restriction blood pressure population remain determined . Objectives : - To assess effect low salt diet versus high salt diet blood pressure normotensive adult age 40 year Karachi , Pakistan - To estimate prevalence salt sensitivity salt resistance normotensive adult age 40 year Karachi , Pakistan Study Design : The propose study prospective , randomize , crossover , open label evaluation trial . Study Population &amp; setting : For propose study , subject age 40 without hypertension fulfil eligibility criterion randomly selected.Informed consent obtain . Each participant would randomize either low salt ( sodium 20mmol/day ) high salt diet ( sodium 220mmol/day ) one week , washout period regular diet one week , reverse initial randomization another week . Blood pressure baseline end intervention week would measure use calibrate automated device sit position right arm 5 minute rest use appropriate size cuff . Three consecutive reading interval 05 minute take mean final two blood pressure reading use analysis . Compliance diet confirm measure 24-hour urinary sodium urinary creatinine throughout study .</detailed_description>
