	<brief_summary>Control food intake , size frequency meal critical development obesity . The stomach signal feeling fullness meal therefore plays role control calorie intake . It unclear whether approve appetite reduce drug sibutramine change function stomach . Differences way individual respond treatment appetite suppressant sibutramine may also explain people lose weight others . This single center clinical study aim compare function stomach healthy , overweight obese individual , evaluate effect FDA-approved appetite suppress medication sibutramine weight loss stomach function patient overweight obese . The effect individual difference inherit gene weight reduction sibutramine test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Control food intake , size frequency meal critical development obesity . The stomach signal satiation response calorie volume ingest , play role control calorie intake . It unclear whether approve appetite reduce drug sibutramine alters gastric physiology . Genetic variation potentially key inter-individual difference response treatment appetite suppressant sibutramine . Aims : 1 . To compare gastric function healthy , overweight obese individual . 2 . To evaluate effect sibutramine gastric function weight patient overweight obese . 3 . To obtain preliminary data effect genetic variation response sibutramine . Methods : We shall measure gastric emptying , fast postprandial gastric volume ( use validate , non-invasive image method ) , postprandial satiation satiety , integrate plasma ghrelin , leptin , insulin , GLP-1 peptide YY level 12 week sibutramine 15mg vs. placebo . We shall also collect DNA , eventually study effect candidate gene response sibutramine . Significance : Our study provide first evidence effect sibutramine gastric function .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Normal weight , overweight obese subject BMI &gt; 18 Kg/m2 residing Olmsted County , MN : Otherwise healthy individual currently treatment cardiac , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , hematological , neurological , endocrine ( hyperglycemia require medical therapy ) unstable psychiatric disease . 2 . Age : 1865 year 3 . Gender : Men woman . Women childbearing potential negative pregnancy test within 48 h enrollment radiation exposure . Exclusion Criteria 1 . Weight exceed 300 pound 137 kilogram ( due limitation regard SPECT image study ) . 2 . Abdominal surgery appendectomy , Caesarian section tubal ligation . 3 . Positive history chronic gastrointestinal disease , systemic disease could affect gastrointestinal motility use medication may alter gastrointestinal motility , appetite absorption e.g. , orlistat ( Xenical &amp; # 61650 ; ) . 4 . Significant psychiatric dysfunction base upon screen Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale [ HADS ] selfadministered alcoholism screen test ( substance abuse ) questionnaire eat weight pattern ( binge eat disorder bulimia ) . If dysfunction identify HADS score &gt; 8 difficulty substance eat disorder , participant exclude give referral letter his/her primary care doctor appraisal followup . 5 . Intake medication , whether prescribed OTC medication ( except multivitamin ) within 7 day study . Exceptions birth control pill , estrogen replacement therapy , thyroxine replacement . 6 . Concomitant use MAOI inhibitor centrally act appetite suppressant ( since would make ineligible sibutramine treatment ) . 7 . Hypersensitivity sibutramine ( since would make ineligible sibutramine treatment ) .</criteria>
