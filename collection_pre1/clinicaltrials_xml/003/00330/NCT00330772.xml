	<brief_summary>Main Research Question ( ) : What effect continue aspirin time coronary artery bypass graft surgery add clopidogrel aspirin coronary artery bypass graft surgery prevent blockage coronary graft , heart attack , stroke , death ? To reliably answer question require large randomised trial . Before apply major grant Canadian Institute Health Research large study would like perform small pilot study 150 patient demonstrate feasible recruit patient use new test call “ CT angiography ” determine whether bypass graft still work become blocked . ( ii ) Why research important ? Coronary artery bypass surgery make important contribution improve health survival patient advance coronary artery disease still many problem . One 10 patient experience heart attack time surgery , 1 20 experience heart attack , stroke , death hospitalization , 1 4 patient least 1 blocked graft within 1 year surgery . Antiplatelet drug aspirin clopidogrel effective prevent heart attack , stroke death aspirin usually stop coronary artery bypass graft surgery concern increase risk bleeding . The effectiveness combination clopidogrel aspirin surgery evaluate . Our pilot study provide key information feasibility help u design perform large definitive study future . ( iii ) What study ? We look blood flow bypass graft well occurrence heart attack , stroke , death . For safety look bleeding , transfusion , need surgery bleeding . We also perform laboratory test platelet function measure compare effect study treatment prevent blood clot form .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preoperative Aspirin Postoperative Antiplatelets Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting : The PAPA CABG Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Platelets play central role pathogenesis ischemic complication ( coronary artery bypass graft occlusion , myocardial infarction , stroke ) follow CABG surgery . Aspirin clopidogrel use alone combination effective prevent ischemic complication broad range high risk patient . However aspirin usually discontinue CABG surgery concern bleed combination aspirin clopidogrel evaluate prevent ischemic complication CABG surgery . OBJECTIVES : The overall objective research compare effectiveness safety aspirin v placebo bypass surgery , clopidogrel plus aspirin v aspirin alone surgery , : 1. blockage coronary artery bypass graft , MI , stroke , death 30 day 2. bleed need transfusion surgery The specific objective present pilot study demonstrate feasibility recruiting patient undergo CABG surgery study perform CT angiography 30 day determine graft patency . We also measure effect different antiplatelet treatment platelet function blood marker systemic inflammation first 48 hour surgery . DESIGN : This 2x2 factorial study 150 elective CABG patient randomize receive low dose aspirin ( 81mg/d ) placebo 5 day prior surgery aspirin 325mg load dose follow 81 mg/d plus clopidogrel 75 mg/d versus aspirin 81 mg/d placebo post operatively . OUTCOME : graft patency measure CT angiography , MI , stroke , death , bleeding , transfusion requirement , need re-exploration surgery , laboratory measure platelet function aspirin resistance ( include 11-dehydro thromboxane B2 ) . SAMPLE SIZE : This pilot study design primarily demonstrate feasibility . We propose recruit total 150 patient 12 month period ( 2-4 per week ) .</detailed_description>
