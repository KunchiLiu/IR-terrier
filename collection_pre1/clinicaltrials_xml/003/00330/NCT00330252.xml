	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether combination alemtuzumab rituximab safe effective treating patient relapse Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( CLL ) determine whether alemtuzumab give single weekly subcutaneous dose , together rituximab .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Weekly Subcutaneous Alemtuzumab Rituximab Relapsed CLL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study propose combine alemtuzumab , effectively treat peripheral blood bone marrow disease CLL , rituximab , activity lymph node disease , streamline convenient administration schedule . Preclinical data support synergistic interaction two . The primary objective ( 1 ) determine overall complete response ( CR ) rate patient relapse CLL determine safety combination , ( 2 ) safety high dose alemtuzumab less frequent interval . Secondary objective ( 1 ) describe duration response , progression-free survival , overall survival patient proceed allo transplant , ( 2 ) determine improvement overall complete response associate administration 2nd eight week course therapy , ( 3 ) ass minimal residual disease certain patient correlate result survival . If least 16 response observe among 35 patient , treatment consider promising . The development antibody therapy hold promise CLL , since CLL therapy palliative , establish therapy show improve survival . Studies suggest contrast see fludarabine alkylating agent , response rate alemtuzumab maintain CLL subject P53 mutation . Tolerability rituximab major activity node make attractive candidate combination alemtuzumab . This single center ( DF/HCC ) , single arm , multi cohort , phase I study , treatment outpatient basis . If initial alemtuzumab dose 30 mg sc d1 , 3 , 5 tolerate , dose escalation cohorts 3 , 90 mg d1 per week . Following determination maximum tolerate dose , accrual remain patient occur dose . Subjects restaged 8 week therapy , may proceed transplant . If deriving benefit , CR , subject may receive another 8 week therapy .</detailed_description>
