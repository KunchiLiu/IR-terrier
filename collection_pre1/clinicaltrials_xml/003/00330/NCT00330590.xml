	<brief_title>Central Venous Access Catheter Placement Using Sonic Flashlight</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We develop new device guide invasive procedure ultrasound ( US ) , call Sonic Flashlight ( SF ) . We attach half-silvered mirror small flat-panel monitor directly ultrasound transducer project virtual image US scan actual location within patient . This permit operator guide needle skin aim directly image , use natural hand-eye coordination rather look away patient conventional display . The device require track head-mounted apparatus , provide intuitive merger visual exterior patient situ ultrasound image , simultaneously view others assist operator . We believe SF increase accuracy , safety , speed , wide variety invasive procedure , require less extensive training conventional US display . Given wide variety procedure SF could use , narrowed focus apply single application : vascular access . We demonstrate clinically SF use successfully guide placement Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter ( PICC ) line . The research propose expand application include insertion Central Venous Access ( CVA ) line internal jugular vein , subclavian vein , femoral vein . The historical approach CVA line placement involve physical exam identification visible landmark . With introduction common usage ultrasound , become routine use ultrasound guidance .
