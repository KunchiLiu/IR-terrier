	<brief_title>SPECTACL : SPECTroscopic Assessment Coronary Lipid</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extensive study conduct past 7 year autopsy specimens demonstrated NIR spectroscopy identify plaque structure suspect cause acute coronary artery syndrome ( unstable angina , myocardial infarction , sudden death ) . The application NIR spectroscopy identify lipid deposition within coronary artery show promising result preclinical ex vivo study ( 14 ) . Infrared spectra collect follow : light discrete wavelength laser direct onto tissue sample via glass fiber . Light scatter sample collect fiber launch spectrometer . The plot signal intensity function wavelength use develop chemometric model discriminate lipid-rich deposit non-atherosclerotic tissue , atherosclerotic tissue predominantly fibrotic blood element . This technique incorporate thin catheter similar dimension IVUS catheter , intracoronary dwell time analysis similar broad experience establish technique proven safety , IVUS .</detailed_description>
