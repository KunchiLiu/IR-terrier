	<brief_summary>B-type Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) hormone make pump chamber heart . The BNP level measure blood test use marker heart problem adult . Deciding child heart problem lung problem difficult , especially infant . Several study demonstrate BNP level elevate child heart disease . The overall goal study able prove obtain BNP level pediatric patient use identify heart problem . We already know kid heart problem high BNP level ( &gt; 200pg/ml ) . We need prove child come Emergency Department non-cardiac problem still normal BNP level ( &lt; 100pg/ml , slightly high newborn population ) . This do comparing BNP level final diagnosis make ED physician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction At Children 's Healthcare Atlanta , thousand child see Emergency Department ( ED ) year evaluation treatment . Deciding child cardiac pulmonary problem difficult , especially infant . Early recognition cardiac disease significantly impact physician 's ability provide appropriate treatment , make necessary intervention , affect patient outcome . An accurate laboratory marker cardiac disease pediatric Emergency Medicine exist . B-Type Natriuretic Peptide ( BNP ) hormone produce ventricular myocardium ( heart muscle ) response increase myocardial demand . It use extensively adult population evaluate patient heart disease , demonstrate accurate differentiation heart disease lung disease adult Emergency Department . There increase experience BNP pediatrics evaluation heart disease , primarily patient congenital heart disease . The normal BNP level le 100 pg/ml , slightly high neonate . Patients present ED diagnose heart disease often admit Cardiac Intensive Care Unit ( CICU ) management stabilization . Part initial evaluation BNP level . These patient usually mark elevation BNP level 2000-5000 pg/ml range upon admission . The level varies type severity heart disease . However little known non-cardiac ED patient BNP level . To utilize BNP accurate marker cardiac disease pediatric ED , clear difference cardiac non-cardiac patient need demonstrate . If large difference BNP level exist pediatric patient heart disease present ED compare child present ED non-cardiac disease process , useful marker heart disease child would demonstrate . Objectives : The objective propose research determine typical BNP level non-cardiac pediatric patient present ED evaluation respiratory and/ infectious process . The endpoint project collection BNP level 100 patient less 6 year age . Hypothesis 1 ( H1 ) : BNP level child non-cardiac disease normal range ( &lt; 100pg/ml ) , easily distinguish elevate level see child congenital acquire heart disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Any child present pediatric ED Children 's Healthcare Atlanta ( CHOA ) Egleston undergo evaluation respiratory and/or infectious disease . Patient age less 6 year old . Patients venipuncture lab study part ED admission . Informed consent obtain legal guardian . Patients know congenital acquire heart disease . Patients previously diagnose systemic disease malignancy , HIV , cystic fibrosis , organ transplant recipient . Patients venipuncture lab study part ED admission . Trauma patient present broken bone , dog bite , etc . ( noninfectious presentation . )</criteria>
