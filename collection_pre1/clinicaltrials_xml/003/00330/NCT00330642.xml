	<brief_title>Rapid Detection Group B Streptococcus ( Strep ) -Labor Delivery Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group B Strep neonatal infection one lead infection newborn , acquire vertical transmission time childbirth . Most case prevent identify woman colonize GBS vaginal-rectal area give colonized woman prophylactic antibiotic labor . About 15-20 % woman colonize nearly woman asymptomatic . Because take 48 hour obtain culture result , currently recommend perform culture clinic 5 week prior due date treat GBS come labor . There several downside strategy . All woman present preterm labor treat culture result become available ( overtreatment ) ; woman go labor wait culture result treat ( overtreatment ) ; prior study show 33 % woman positive 35 week , negative birth ( overtreatment ) 10 % negative 35 week positive birth ( undertreatment ) ; lose missing culture result ( over- undertreatment ) . Using microfluidics fluorescent PCR , new test identify GBS reliably 30 45 minute vitro . This study propose evaluate clinical performance ( sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value ) microfluidic rapid GBS technique un-selected sequential woman present labor delivery , compare culture take time 35-37 week culture woman . We also evaluate identification GBS rupture membrane ( amniotomy ) use standard GBS culture rapid PCR ( HandyLab technology ) .</detailed_description>
