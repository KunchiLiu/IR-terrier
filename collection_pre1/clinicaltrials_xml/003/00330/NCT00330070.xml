	<detailed_description>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study include subject persistent moderate severe asthma require inhale corticosteroid inhale short-acting β2-agonists ( SABAs ) . Subjects pass screen Visit 1 enter 2-3 week baseline period confirm stable asthma symptom collect baseline data . Subjects continue ongoing prescribe treatment period , modify investigator base clinical judgment . Subjects use SABA prescribed alleviate asthma symptom need basis throughout study . If eligible , Visit 2 subject randomize treatment either IPL512,602 ( 20 mg ) daily placebo 1:1 ratio . Randomization treatment group stratify two subgroup : receive low medium dos inhaled corticosteroid ( ≤500 µg per day fluticasone equivalent ) receive high dos inhale corticosteroid ( &gt; 500 µg per day fluticasone equivalent ) . During 8-week treatment period , subject return clinic 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 week treatment ( Visits 3-7 ) .
