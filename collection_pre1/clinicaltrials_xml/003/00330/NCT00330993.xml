	<brief_summary>HYPOTHESIS : For woman pregnancy &lt; 49 , 50-56 , 57-63 day gestation receive mifepristone 200 mg orally misoprostol 800 mcg buccally time , complete abortion rate 24 hour misoprostol administration 90 % ( 95 % CI 78 % , 97 % ) within gestational age group . This prospective clinical trial . Women enrol 40 woman three gestational age range : ≤49 , 50-56 , 57-63 day gestation day treatment initiate . Once gestational age range include 40 subject , enrollment group close . Subjects swallow mifepristone 200 mg place four 200 µg misoprostol tablet check gum ( 2 tablet side ) . The woman instruct keep tablet place 30 minute ; remain portion tablet swallow time . Participants follow-up 24 hour receive misoprostol .

	<detailed_description>1 . TELEPHONE SCREEN : Initial contact phone call ( , rarely , drop-in visit ) initiate potential study participant . A member research staff advise potential participant study rationale , protocol , risk , benefit , visit schedule . We request waiver requirement obtain sign informed consent screen process , usually take place phone . We believe meet criterion use waiver screen procedure present minimal risk harm subject involve procedure write consent normally require outside research context . The information obtain screen phone call type information would collect patient set appointment abortion . The telephone script screen include Attachment 2 . If subject meet inclusion criterion , information collect screen process destroy . Potential subject interested participation schedule screening visit . Each subject undergo minimum 3 visit perform Family Planning Research Office Magee-Womens Hospital . She also receive minimum 3 follow-up telephone call . Those subject pass pregnancy first follow-up visit schedule return visit indicate Study Flow Sheet ( see attachment ) describe . 2 . SCREENING AND ENROLLMENT : Visit length 1 ½ hour . 1 . After obtain consent screen ultrasound evaluation , transvaginal transabdominal ultrasound examination perform ascertain gestational age . The transvaginal ultrasound result use confirm gestational age document intrauterine gestation study protocol . Vaginal ultrasound confirm estimate gestational age ( EGA ) use follow criterion : - EGA ( day ) = mean sac diameter + 3025 - EGA ( day ) = embryonic pole + 4226 - Mean sac diameter ( [ length + width + depth ] /3 ) use embryonic pole present . - If ultrasound EGA different LMP EGA 4 day , ultrasound EGA use study EGA . 2 . Written inform consent obtain screen visit prior research activity . The investigator one co-investigators , physician , sign inform consent document . 3 . After obtain informed consent , medical history initial laboratory test ( hemoglobin blood type ) obtain . If pelvic examination normal , endovaginal ultrasound confirm gestational age le 63 day day mifepristone administration , laboratory test satisfy entry criterion , subject ask participate study . 4 . A HIPAA compliant “ Release Medical Records ” form sign allow future access medical record relate care provide study another health care provider . 3 . VISIT 1 : The subject return prior reach 64 day gestation . This day consider Study Day 1 . Visit length 30 minute . 1 . The research staff administer pre-study questionnaire . The subject complete Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) assessment . 2 . Eligibility criterion review , indicate history bleeding since screening , vaginal ultrasound perform . 3 . A licensed clinician distribute medication completion questionnaire . The medication keep lock file research office log generate track medication usage , lot number , expiration date . All subject take mifepristone misoprostol front research clinician . - She receive mifepristone 200 mg orally swallow tablet front one researcher . THE SUBJECT CAN NOT RECEIVE THE MIFEPRISTONE UNTIL A MINIMUM OF 24 HOURS AFTER COMPLETION OF THE INFORMED CONSENT . - Within 5 minute mifepristone administration , subject give four 200 µg tablet misoprostol place cheek gum ( 2 side ) allow remain location 30 minute . After time lapse , remain tablet swallow . The subject need wait office 30 minute . 4 . The subject receive prescription codeine ( 30 mg ) hydrocodone ( 5 mg ) , # 20 instruction sheet phone number call question problem . 5 . Rh-immune globulin administer Rh-negative . 6 . The subject schedule follow-up 24 ± 1 hour administration misoprostol . 4 . VISIT 2 : 24 ± 1 hour misoprostol administration . Visit length 1 hour . 1 . Endovaginal abdominal ultrasound examination perform . - If vaginal ultrasound examination demonstrate gestational sac , subject receive “ rescue ” dose vaginal misoprostol ( four 200 µg tablet misoprostol ) , place clinician . A follow-up appointment schedule study Day 15 ( range Day 13-17 ) - If vaginal ultrasound demonstrate sac abortion consider complete telephone follow-up contact schedule evaluation point forward . 2 . All subject complete post-study VAS , take 5 minute complete . 5 . TELEPHONE FOLLOW-UP # 1 : Study Day 8 ( range Day 6-10 ) . Call length 10 minute . Subjects contact assess clinical status include bleeding , cramp , medication requirement . If necessary , base subject ’ response , appointment evaluation clinician make time . 6 . VISIT 3/TELEPHONE FOLLOW-UP # 2 : Study Day 15 ( range Day 13-17 ) . Visit length ( require ) 1 hour , call length 10 minute ) 1 . Subjects expel gestational sac base prior ultrasound examination receive telephone follow-up ass clinical status . Appointments evaluation clinician make necessary . A post-study acceptability questionnaire perform subject telephone , take 5 minute complete . 2 . Subjects expel gestational sac prior examination return office visit . Endovaginal abdominal ultrasound perform . - If vaginal ultrasound show intrauterine gestation embryonic cardiac activity , subject offer advised surgical abortion do soon possible . After D &amp; C , subject complete 5-minute post-study acceptability questionnaire . She also telephone follow-up Study Day 36 . - If vaginal ultrasound show gestational sac present without embryonic cardiac activity , subject may D &amp; C complete acceptability questionnaire pursue expectant management return Study Day 36 ( range Day 32-40 ) . - If vaginal ultrasound demonstrate absence gestational sac , complete post-study acceptability questionnaire end visit take 5 minute complete follow perform telephone . 7 . VISIT 4/TELEPHONE FOLLOW_UP # 3 : Study Day 36 ( range Day 32-40 ) . Visit length ( require ) 30 minutes-1 hour , call length 10 minute . 1 . Subjects expel gestational sac base prior ultrasound examination D &amp; C receive telephone follow-up ass clinical status . Appointments evaluate clinical make necessary . 2 . If subject must return visit , endovaginal abdominal ultrasound examination perform . If vaginal ultrasound show gestational sac still present , patient offer surgical abortion . 3 . At completion surgical abortion ultrasound demonstrate absence sac , 5-minute post-study acceptability questionnaire perform . 8 . OTHER 1 . The subject question visit regard side effect experience medication , bleed cramping , pain medication require , medication use since last visit . 2 . If subject return schedule visit , telephone reschedule visit . If patient unable return follow-up , required information regard bleed history , medication , medication side effect , questionnaire answer obtain phone . If subject unable reach phone within two week schedule visit , certified letter must send indicate need return . Subjects consider lose follow-up final visit complete time study close . 3 . If subject fail return Visit 2 , return later time study participation period find retain gestational sac continue pregnancy ultrasound , may receive additional vaginal dose misoprostol ( 4 tablet ; Study Day 12 ) offer D &amp; C ( time ) . 4 . The subject counsel intercourse drink alcohol completion abortion confirm . 5 . Contraceptive counseling perform throughout study . A method contraception institute abortion occur subject resume sexual activity . 6 . Endovaginal ultrasound may perform time require protocol felt necessary clinician . 7 .
