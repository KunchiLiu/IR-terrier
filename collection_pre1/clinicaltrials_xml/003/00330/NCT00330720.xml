	<brief_summary>What elderly patient fall seriously injured challenge decision patient Emergency Physician . Unfortunately , homecare support often unavailable week . The patient physician must choose discharge home without support , hospitalization . An emergency response service ( ERS ) allow patient summon assistance anywhere home , may provide another option . Objectives : To see ERS affect patient ’ anxiety , fear fall , use health-care system discharge . We study patient 70 year age fall need hospitalize . Our belief ERS improve patient anxiety , may prevent return visit Emergency episode prolong immobilization fall . Methods : Patients agree participate study assign chance receive either current standard discharge care , standard care plus use emergency response system . Patients interview one month discharge compare impact ERS . This study first step decide whether ERS useful new technology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Design &amp; Methods : 3.1 . Study Design &amp; Setting : A prospective , assessment blind , randomize study design use . Patients randomized intervention group give ERS communicator period 30 day follow visit ED . Patients conventional care group receive standard advice upon discharge . ( See Control Group , ) . Sunnybrook Women ’ College Health Sciences Center tertiary , university-affiliated teaching hospital annual Emergency Department census 40,000 patient . An audit patient present Emergency Department month December 2000 identify 87 patient 70 year attend fall fall-related injury discharge . 3.2 . Study Population : The study include elderly patient present Emergency Department institution complaint fall , discharge home treating physician . The propose trial design guide practical choice rather merely acquire scientific information . In term Schwartz Lellouch , ‘ pragmatic ’ rather ‘ explanatory ’ . Patients comply allocate treatment analyze accord “ intention–to-treat ” principle . 3.2.1 . Inclusion Criteria : 1 . Age Greater equal 70 year . 2 . Primary complaint fall discharge home directly Emergency Department . 3.2.2 . Exclusion Criteria : Definition Rationale : Exclusion Criteria : Definition /Rationale 1 . Admitted hospital Will benefit intervention 2 . Not independently live Not live domicile , Seniors residence subject responsible activity daily life /Dependant individual likely benefit intervention 3 . No Phone Line Required install ERS Line 4 . Unable give inform consent Communication barrier , dementia ( MMS &lt; 23 ) 5 . Living outside catchment area Postal code Residence/Follow-up impractical 3.3 . Patient recruitment : All eligible patient present study hour ( 08.00h-22.00h , 7 day week ) introduce study Research Nurse . Patients express interest study participation ask provide formal write consent randomize either control intervention group ( see “ Intervention ” , ) prior discharge Emergency Department . To maximize follow-up , contact information verify prior discharge , include information next kin family physician . 3.4 . Control Group Current standard care elderly fall institution involve referral Emergency Geriatric Nurse Clinician , available 9 5 , seven day week . Patients refer hour currently receive telephone follow-up next day . Based face-to face telephone interview , Geriatric Nurse Clinician arrange follow-up Regional Geriatric Assessment program , suggest gait-aids cane walker , may recommend change client ’ living arrangement . 3.5 . Intervention Patients randomized intervention group receive standard care outline . In addition , give emergency response system ( ERS ) trial period 30 day follow visit ED . The ERS consist battery operate personal alarm system , keep within reach patient time . The ERS monitor 24 hour per day response team , access update summary medical history social circumstance client . Patients instructed activate ERS fall event require assistance . Once system activate , automate log event generate . The response team communicate individual via 2-way speaker , determine resource require ( e.g . dispatch ambulance , mobilization home care , private health care , family support ) . The propose benefit system provide timely access assistance team specific knowledge patient client restrict mobility , impaired visual auditory acuity , cognitive impairment might interfere ability access choose appropriate level response health care system use exist method 911 Telehealth . 3.6 . Length Follow-up All patient contact telephone one week arrange follow-up home visit interview 30-37 day discharge ED . Previous study show high return rate occur first month discharge , , visit first month likely problem latter visit 31 . 3.7 . Primary Outcome : Hospital Anxiety Scale The primary goal current pilot study determine impact ERS patient quality life discharge Emergency Department , measure Hospital Anxiety Scale 1 . The HAD-A scale use widely assessment anxiety many different patient group , include elderly 21 , , screen tool outcome measure , show satisfactory level psychometric validity 42 . The scale consist seven Likert scale , score 0 3 , theoretical range 0 21 . 3.7.1 . Secondary Outcomes : Fear Falling Efficacy Scale : The fall efficacy scale previously validate scale design measure elders self-confidence ability avoid fall daily living activity 2,28 . Elders rate confidence avoid fall 0 10 scale ten activity ( see Appendix A. ) . In addition , measure patient ’ confidence , fall , would able get . 3.7.2 . Health Care Utilization : Health care utilization measure patient report utilization follow health care resource month follow presentation : ED 1 . Total return visit emergency department ; 2 . Total family physician visit ; 3 . Total contact Tele-health ; 4 . Total admission hospital length stay ; 3.7.3 . Patient caregiver perception ERS It important document behavioural social process attendant upon introduction new technology , innovative application exist technology . In instance shall , short series semi-structured question , ask patient receipt Lifeline reflect day day experience relation possession use equipment , month follow visit emergency department , perceive impact scheme family friend . This component study derive phenomenological paradigm , specifically adopt ethnographic methodology order elicit patient-centered account technology 3.7.4 . Patient Morbidity We compare follow measure patient morbidity : 1 . Self-reported fall 2 . Self-reported injury 3 . Length immobilization “ Down time ” . The ERS potential reduce patient morbidity prevent terrify experience prolong period immobility incapacitation fall . In literature , “ downtime ” generally estimate patient self-report . When patient unable estimate , last witnessed time patient ambulatory contact another individual use proxy . 3.8 . Data Collection Demographic variable ( age , gender , home circumstance , mini mental status , social support ) record patient ’ ED chart relate present event . A questionnaire ( see Appendix A ) administer face-to-face interview patient treatment conventional care group . Baseline interview conduct prior randomization ensure blinding . The questionnaire include HAD-A scale Fear-Efficacy scale 2 . In addition core item , people intervention group ask describe experience view ERS . Their response record verbatim . 3.9 . Data Analysis Plan Numerical data enter directly SAS ( v10 ) database statistical analysis , follow general principle Pocock relation simple one-way trial , ‘ intention treat ’ . The narrative ( “ qualitative ” ) data analyze use framework method . 3.10 . The sample size calculation base ability detect difference anxiety , primary outcome , measure HADS-A . There definition literature minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ) HADS-A . Two previous large study community dwell elder find 3 point change HADS-A represent two-standard deviation baseline assessment.33 Using 3 point MCID yield sample size requirement 11 subject per group . Such small sample size would permit analysis secondary endpoint , might judge lack face validity . Thus , conservative definition MCID HADS-A 1.5 point choose . Because uncertainty regard distribution HADS-A score target population , use Wilcoxon rank sum test estimate require sample size . Given standard deviation 3.4 , alpha 0.05 , 40 subject per group , study would 95 % power detect between-group reduction 1.5 point 6.0 4.5 mean HADS-A score . 3.10.1 . Recruitment rate A pilot study institution demonstrate one month period , 87 patient 70 year age discharge emergency department . Assuming 45 % attendee recruit , estimate approximately 39 people per month available recruitment . Assuming 10 % loss follow-up , estimate five-month period require recruit 160 subject . 3.11 . Ethical Considerations Ethical approval seek institutional research ethic board SWCHSC . The Research Nurse obtain full write informed consent . Patient confidentiality strictly maintain . Data make anonymous analysis , result publish impossible identify participant . Documents patient identification keep , separate , lock file cabinet . The data archive five year follow completion study , destroy .</detailed_description>
