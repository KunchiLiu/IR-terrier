	<brief_summary>This study aim assess impact train General Practitioners ( GPs ) adherence antihypertensive medication among hypertensive individual . It also aim assess risk factor non-adherence . Special training ( appropriate algorithm management patient involvement therapeutic decision making ) give GPs . The study conduct six middle low income cluster Karachi recruit individual randomize specially trained untrained GPs , follow-up period 6 week . The medication event monitoring system ( MEMS ) use assess adherence . It hypothesize compliance level individual go specially train GPs high compare go GPs receive special training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Lack medication compliance report major factor contribute inadequate control blood pressure . Data well-structured well-conducted research field , specifically context develop country lack . Rationale : Targeting factor associate non-adherence identify study would lead reduction burden poorly control hypertension complication . The special training GPs , take intervention study , find successful improve compliance , would advocate inclusion nation-wide hypertension control program . Aims : 1 . To assess difference adherence antihypertensive medication among hypertensive individual visit specially train GPs , versus visiting untrained GPs . 2 . To assess risk factor associate non-adherence Study Design : Randomised Controlled Trial Parent Study : This project stem population-based parent study “ Population base strategy effective control high blood pressure Pakistan ” ; factorial design study . It conduct twelve middle low socioeconomic cluster Karachi . These cluster randomise care specially trained general practitioner ( GP ) vs. untrained GPs . Special training GPs include rigorously train appropriate algorithms management , patient involvement therapeutic decision making . Methodology : The target population study draw parent study . 6 cluster randomize GP train intervention select . The specially trained GPs parent study intervention research . Hypertensive individual within chosen cluster randomly select enrollment study . Patients go specially train untrained GPs take expose unexposed intervention , follow month half month , order ass adherence antihypertensive medication . Adherence assess help Medication Event Monitoring System ( MEMS ) , give date time bottle open . method however ensure ingestion drug . Intervention : GPs train appropriate algorithms management patient involvement therapeutic decision making</detailed_description>
