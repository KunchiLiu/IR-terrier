	<brief_summary>In current proposal , intend study efficacy bupropion SR without combine contingency management ( CM ) among adolescent cigarette smoker . The propose study test medication ( bupropion SR ) , also combination medication CM potentially improve smoke cessation outcome AND retention adolescent smoker study . Hypothesis test : Bupropion SR treatment increase abstinence cigarette smoking ( measure urine cotinine continuous abstinence ) adolescent smoker compare treatment placebo . Hypothesis test : Adolescent smoker treat combined bupropion SR + contingency management ( CM ) treatment increased retention increase abstinence rate compare bupropion SR alone CM + placebo treat group ( measure decrease drop-out participant , urine cotinine continuous abstinence ) . Hypothesis test : CM increase abstinence cigarette smoking ( measure urine cotinine continuous abstinence ) adolescent smoker compare treatment placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combined Pharmaco/Behavior Therapy Adolescent Smokers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test hypothesis , 216 adolescent smoker recruit . Fifty-four adolescent smoker recruit four group : bupropion SR , bupropion SR + CM , CM + placebo , placebo . The cell balance gender attention deficit hyperactivity disorder use permuted block randomization . A counsel intervention add group reason would unethical provide active treatment cigarette smoking adolescent . The counsel intervention consist two quit smoking brochure provide information tip help quit smoking . The study consist one-week lead period follow six-week treatment trial . For medication group , medication titrate one-week lead-in period . The primary outcome measure urine cotinine self-report cigarette use collect use Time-Line Follow-Back end six week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Regular cigarette smoker smoke least 5 cigarette per day derive TimeLine FollowBack method ( Sobell et al. , 1988 ) . Average number cigarette per day ( past 30 day ) use . Five cigarette per day may seem low , base previous study , adolescent tend smoke few cigarette per day compare adult . 2 . Baseline urine cotinine level great 100 ng/ml . 3 . Age range 12 â€“ 21 4 . If 18 yr. age , parent ( ) guardian ( ) able participate inform consent initial assessment , participant must provide evidence emancipate status . 5 . For post menarchal female participant : agree use birth control avoid pregnancy . 1 . Active substance abuse/dependence ( nicotine ) within 2 week prior participate study 2 . Lifetime bipolar affective disorder ( BPAD ) , psychosis , eat disorder . Bupropion may adverse consequence participant psychiatric diagnosis . 3 . Current major depressive disorder . Since bupropion also antidepressant , criterion minimize confound depressive disorder study . History depressive disorder current attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) exclusion . We use permuted block randomization procedure balance group ADHD . 4 . Pregnancy lactation . The safety bupropion pregnancy lactation well study . 5 . History seizure disorder predisposition seizure ( e.g. , history significant head trauma , currently take medication low seizure threshold ) , since bupropion lower seizure threshold . 6 . History severe renal , hepatic , neurological , chronic pulmonary disease . This criterion choose due hepatic metabolism bupropion . 7 . Unstable medical problem 8 . Allergy bupropion 9 . Current treatment medication contain bupropion 10 . Current treatment monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitor currently within 2 week start study since may serious severe medical interaction MAO inhibitor bupropion SR. 11 . Current treatment nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) 12 . History intolerance nonresponse bupropion SR. 13 . Current ( past month ) suicide ideation 14 . Suicide attempt ( past year )</criteria>
