	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn sunitinib malate ( SU011248 ) help control VHL . The safety drug also study . Primary objective : - Evaluate safety treatment SU011248/sunitinib malate ( 50 mg daily dose 4 week , 2 week ) 6 month patient Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome ( VHL ) measurable lesion undergo surveillance Secondary objective : - Evaluate efficacy treatment SU011248/sunitinib malate ( 50 mg daily dose 4 week , 2 week ) 6 month patient VHL measurable lesion undergo surveillance Correlative objective : - Evaluate quality life SU011248/sunitinib malate therapy VHL patient - Evaluate peripheral blood lymphocyte receptor phosphorylation VHL patient take SU011248/sunitinib malate ( optional procedure ) - Correlate result dynamic contrast-enhanced diffusion weight MRI dynamic contrast enhance CT response explore finding suggestive surrogate early response ( optional procedure )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sunitinib malate design block pathway control important event growth blood vessel essential growth cancer . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You standard scan check status disease , include compute tomography ( CT ) scan chest abdomen ( stomach area ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan spine , lesion area . You electrocardiogram ( ECG -- test measure electrical activity heart ) echocardiogram MUGA scan ( echocardiogram/MUGA scan - test determine well heart function measure ability pump blood ) . If doctor know suspect VHL affect eye eye exam perform . Your complete medical history record physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , height , weight . You ask medication treatment currently take . Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . You also ask ability perform daily activity . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . You ask complete 2 questionnaire ask quality life level fatigue . It take 20 minute complete questionnaire . The questionnaire complete 4-6 week later , end treatment . If find eligible take part study , take sunitinib malate day , either without food . You take drug 4 week row follow 2 week rest study drug . These 6 week call study `` cycle '' . Before begin new cycle , physical exam complete medical history record . Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . You ask drug take side effect may experience . You also ask ability perform daily activity . At end Cycles 2 4 , CT MRI scan evaluate status disease eye exam may repeat known lesion eye ( ) . You may receive treatment study 24 week . However show benefit study drug , may continue study additional 24 week . ( maximum total 48 week ) You take study disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . Once stop treatment , end-of-study visit . At visit , physical exam blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . You ask medication take side effect may experience . You CT MRI scan evaluate status disease , well eye exam eye affect disease . If complete least 1 cycle treatment study , image scan past 28 day , skip end study evaluation return 48 week follow-up visit . You follow-up visit 48 week date enrollment study . At visit , physical exam blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . You ask medication take side effect may experience . You CT MRI scan evaluate status disease . If eye affect disease , follow-up eye exam . Once complete 48 week follow-up visit , consider off-study . This investigational study . Sunitinib malate authorize FDA research purpose . About 28 patient take part clinical research study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must genetically confirm Von HippelLindau ( VHL ) disease . At least one measurable VHLrelated lesion , undergo surveillance , patient immediate risk need intervention lesion .

Allowable prior therapy : ( 1 ) Patients undergone prior therapy VHL lesion may enroll long criteria met . Previously radiate lesion may consider target lesion unless demonstrate unequivocal evidence growth ; ( 2 ) Major surgery , chemotherapy radiation therapy complete &gt; 4 week prior start study treatment . Age &gt; /= 18 year . Because dose adverse event data currently available use SU011248/sunitinib malate patient &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric singleagent trial , applicable . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; /= 2 Patients must normal organ marrow function define : ( 1 ) serum aspartate transaminase ( [ AST ] ; serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase [ SGOT ] ) serum alanine transaminase ( [ ALT ] ; serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase [ SGPT ] ) &lt; /= 2.5 x local laboratory upper limit normal ( ULN ) , AST ALT &lt; /= 5 x ULN liver function abnormality due underlying malignancy ; ( 2 ) Total serum bilirubin &lt; /=1.5 x ULN ; ( 3 ) Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; /= 1500mcL ; ( 4 ) Platelets &gt; /= 100,000 mcL ; ( 5 ) Hemoglobin &gt; /= 9.0 g/dL ; ( 6 ) Serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 x UL . Eligibility patient receive medication substance know affect potential affect activity pharmacokinetics SU011248/sunitinib malate list determine follow review case Principal Investigators . If possible , effort make switch motivate patient medication , otherwise patient exclude : ( 1 ) Ketoconazole , ( 2 ) Theophylline , ( 3 ) Phenobarbital , ( 4 ) Coumadin therapeutic dos ( low dose Coumadin 2 mg po daily thromboprophylaxis allow ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients metastatic disease kind . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition SU011248/sunitinib malate .
