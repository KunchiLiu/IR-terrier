	<detailed_description>Moderate consumption red wine associate reduce coronary artery disease mortality . Cardioprotective effect red wine may partly relate ability improve endothelial function . Red wine increase endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilatation brachial artery acutely ingestion . Moreover , heavy dose red wine ( ethanol 1.0 g/kg ) show increase coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) measure transthoracic Doppler echocardiography . CFR depict relative increase coronary blood flow response maximal myocardial hyperemia induce adenosine . It reduce atherosclerosis various condition associate dysfunction coronary microcirculation , diabetes hypercholesterolemia . Both ethanol antioxidative polyphenols implicate beneficial endothelial effect red wine . However , relative contribution remain uncertain vivo . It suggest red wine stronger vasoactive property alcohol beverage , even de-alcoholized red wine may sufficient improve flow-mediated dilatation brachial artery . Cognac also know contain polyphenols , effect coronary circulation evaluate . The purpose randomize control cross-over study determine transthoracic echocardiography whether moderate dos red wine improve CFR response adenosine healthy human . We also study contribution ethanol antioxidant compare effect equal dos alcoholic de-alcoholized red wine , cognac plasma antioxidant capacity CFR .</detailed_description>
