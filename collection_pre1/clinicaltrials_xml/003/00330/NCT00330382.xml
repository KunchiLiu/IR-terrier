	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate work prevent cancer patient oral leukoplakia . Chemoprevention use certain substance keep cancer forming , grow , come back . The use Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate , substance make soy , may keep cancer form patient oral leukoplakia</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bowman-Birk Inhibitor Concentrate Preventing Cancer Patients With Oral Leukoplakia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine chemoprevention Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate ( BBIC ) prevent cancer patient oral leukoplakia ( OL ) . II . Determine clinical histologic response rate OL BBIC . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure effect BBIC intermediate marker endpoint level . II . Correlate clinical histologic response OL cellular level proteolytic activity , erb-B2 ( neu ) , retinioc acid receptor β , bcl-2 , mutant p53 expression , serum level neu . III . Determine individual group side effect BBIC . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , study . Prior randomization , patient receive oral placebo 4 week . Patients show good compliance ( &gt; 75 % packet count ) randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate twice daily 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete questionnaire diet , tobacco , alcohol usage baseline completion study treatment . Blood , urine , biopsy tissue collect baseline completion study treatment . Oral mucosal cell collect baseline , run-in phase , randomization , completion study treatment , 3 month completion study treatment . Samples examine protease activity , level bcl-2 erbB-2 , mutant p53 oncogene expression epidermal growth factor receptor , retinoic acid receptor-β expression . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
