	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well vorinostat work treat patient progressive metastatic prostate cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , vorinostat , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Vorinostat may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy oral SAHA patient castrate metastatic prostate cancer progress one prior chemotherapy , measure proportion patient progress 6 month . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety oral SAHA patient castrate metastatic prostate cancer progress one prior chemotherapy . II . To assess objective response rate oral SAHA patient measurable disease present . III . To assess rate PSA decline &gt; = 50 % . IV . To assess progression free median survival patient castrate metastatic prostate cancer progress one prior chemotherapy . V. To evaluate pre post-treatment tumor biopsy available presence change expression AR Hsp90 client protein , Thioredoxin , Thioredoxin Binding Protein , HDAC 3 ( class I ) , HDAC 7 ( class II ) , EZH2 p21 expression . VI . To determine effect oral SAHA IL-6 , soluble IL-6 receptor soluble gp130 level blood . VII . To determine accumulation biodistribution 18FDHT correlate finding standard FDG PET , radionuclide bone scan , CT and/or MRI scan , well 18FDHT pharmacokinetics tumor tissue stain androgen receptor ( AR ) Hsp90 client protein ( applies patient MSKCC separate protocol # 00-095 ) . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral vorinostat ( SAHA ) daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21 day least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) 4 course receive additional 3 course . All patient may continue treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Blood sample take day 15 course 1 , day 1 course 2 , last week course 4 , completion study treatment . Blood examine interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-6 receptor , gp130 level . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically survival .</detailed_description>
