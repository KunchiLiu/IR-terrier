	<brief_summary>The study involve use isoniazid cotrimoxazole strategy prevent infection HIV-infected child reduce mortality . Cotrimoxazole well know reduce mortality infection HIV-infected child currently recommend standard care . However , isoniazid study HIV-infected adult ( show substantially reduce incidence tuberculosis ) . In randomised control study isoniazid HIV-infected child , investigator find INH reduce mortality tuberculosis incidence excess 50 % ; data safety monitor board recommend termination placebo arm give beneficial effect INH . The investigator therefore aim follow-up child compare long term impact two different INH CTX preventive regimen ( daily versus thrice weekly ) morbidity , mortality , adherence incidence adverse reaction . The investigator also aim investigate efficacy , safety tolerability INH compare placebo prevention TB child receive HAART benefit group unknown .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Tuberculosis ( TB ) HIV dual pandemic occur South Africa . Prevention TB subsequent decline immune function HIV-infected child important strategy reduce mortality . Isoniazid ( INH ) prophylaxis reduces TB incidence HIV-infected adult , efficacy HIV-infected child study . In 2003 , investigator therefore begin double blind placebo control trial investigate impact INH prophylaxis mortality , morbidity TB incidence HIV-infected child . Interim analysis find strike reduction mortality TB decrease mortality excess 50 % 60 % respectively , child INH . Based , placebo arm terminate ; study continue trial thrice versus daily INH cotrimoxazole ( CTX ) . Although result indicate important benefit child INH , unknown long term efficacy safety INH prophylaxis , optimal regime whether pertains child HAART ( form minority cohort still risk TB ) . Aim To investigate efficacy , safety tolerability INH CTX prophylactic strategy HIV-infected child high TB prevalence area . Objectives 1 . To compare long term impact two different INH preventive regimen ( daily versus thrice weekly ) TB incidence , occurrence INH resistance patient culture-confirmed TB , mortality , incidence adverse reaction adherence 2 . To compare long term impact two different CTX prophylactic regimen ( daily versus thrice weekly ) mortality , frequency duration hospitalization , type serious infection , nasopharyngeal carriage bacteria development antimicrobial resistance , adherence incidence adverse reaction 3 . To investigate efficacy , safety tolerability INH compare placebo prevention TB child receive HAART Methods A prospective randomize double blind placebo control study INH versus placebo newly recruit HIV-infected child stable HAART . In addition , extend follow-up study child already randomise thrice weekly daily INH CTX . Children follow 2 year regular clinical evaluation , adherence assessment laboratory monitoring . Outcomes measured mortality , TB incidence , morbidity , adherence tolerability .</detailed_description>
