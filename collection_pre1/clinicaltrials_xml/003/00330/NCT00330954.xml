	<brief_summary>One goal Kansas City Diabetes Consortium identify characterize gene product associate T1DM . Characterization gene product aid develop new tool risk assessment , development new prevention strategy monitor progression disease . Study design : Descriptive , basic science pilot study . The result pilot study use help design much large study address importance viral response autoimmune diabetes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The hypothesis viral responsive gene up-regulated prior onset symptom Type 1 Diabetes ( T1DM ) may correlate increase expression interferon alpha . Both genetic environmental factor contribute risk development T1DM . There number conflicting report associate viral infection T1DM genetically susceptible individual causality proven . Viruses may large role initiation islet cell autoimmunity role acceleration disease lead overt symptom . There study describe viral responsive gene expression individual .</detailed_description>
