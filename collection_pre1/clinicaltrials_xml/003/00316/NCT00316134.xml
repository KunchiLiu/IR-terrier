	<brief_title>Multiple Biomarkers Undiagnosed Pleural Effusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 1.6 million case pleural effusion see US per year , ~210,000 case due underlying malignancy . Pleural fluid traditionally divide two type : transudative exudative . The common cause transudative pleural effusion congestive heart failure cirrhosis . Common cause exudative pleural effusion include malignancy , pneumonia , pulmonary embolism viral infection . One study find 42 % exudative effusion due malignancy , another found malignancy underlie cause 24 % effusion . Differential diagnosis various cause effusion complex include gross appearance pleural fluid ( PF ) , differential cell count , cytology , glucose LDH level , sometimes adenosine deaminase ( ADA ) level . In addition , spiral CT scan , bronchoscopy , thoracoscopy , needle biopsy pleura , video assist thoracoscopy ( VATS ) utilize determine underlying cause pleural fluid accumulation . These procedure expensive may traumatic patient . In approximately 20 % patient present pleural fluid accumulation , underlie cause establish . Despite promising result publish peer-reviewed journal last two decade , serum biomarkers gain acceptance standard care management patient lung cancer , mesothelioma , pleural effusion . The purpose clinical trial evaluate ability various biomarkers measure serum and/or pleural fluid estimate risk find cancer patient undiagnosed pleural effusion . An algorithm prediction risk find cancer patient use optimal combination marker develop , patient categorize low , moderate , high risk find cancer might use effectively triage patient . For example , high risk cancer may use justify invasive expensive procedure , spiral CT scan thoracoscopy . This prospective , multi-center , double-blind , statistically power clinical trial enroll patient schedule undergo procedure removal fluid pleural effusion ( i.e . thoracentesis , thoracoscopy , image guide thoracentesis , thoracotomy , chest tube placement , PleurexÂ® catheter insertion , etc. ) . The primary objective study evaluate ability multiple biomarkers serum and/or pleural fluid estimate risk find cancer subject present undiagnosed pleural effusion ( i.e . unknown origin ) . The secondary objective study compare ability multiple biomarkers serum and/or pleural fluid combine pleural fluid cytology laboratory result use multiple biomarkers alone estimate risk find cancer subject present undiagnosed pleural effusion . The research objectives study evaluation utility multiple biomarkers serum and/or pleural fluid predict tissue origin subject cancer present undiagnosed pleural effusion comparison result pleural fluid cytology . Correlation biomarker level serum pleural fluid evaluate well .</detailed_description>
