Consolidation chemotherapy permit Subject 's disease consider potentially platinumsensitive ( i.e. , platinumfree interval follow complete response carboplatin cisplatin great 6 month ) Subject must least one measurable lesion determine diagnostic study include CT MRI physical exam . Measurable disease must accurately measure least one dimension ( long dimension record ) . Each lesion must 20 mm long dimension measure conventional technique , include palpation , plain Xray , CT MRI , 10 mm measure spiral CT. Palpable tumor mass evaluate radiologically must 2 diameter 20 mm . An attempt document lesion size ultrasound undertaken palpable lesion visualize CT ( MRI ) . The diagnostic imaging method use evaluate disease must use throughout study evaluate lesion consistently Stable blood , liver renal function .
