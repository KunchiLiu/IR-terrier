	<brief_summary>With introduction National Insurance Law Israel 1995 , increase effort reduce hospitalization general length stay hospital particular . Under nourished patient show longer mean length stay likely suffer complication , significantly increase cost care . Intense nutritional intervention program , aim decrease rehospitalizations post hospitalization complication , clearly currently include basket service provide law . Nutritional intervention show clinically efficacious cost-effective . Demonstration benefit intervention , term reduce expenditure quality care , may open path specific nutritional intervention program need old person discharge Acute Care . Given effort make reduce length hospitalization time , even frail elderly patient , clear full scale nutritional intervention complete hospitalization . Therefore , need create continuity in-patient follow-up nutritional intervention . This combined policy potential improve general health , reduce rate nutrition associate complication , thus reduce future hospitalization , along mortality morbidity associate . It plausible improve general health less frequent hospitalization eventuate cost reduction allow intervention cost effective . Furthermore , descriptive information regard nutritional status old patient admit Acute Care department may important policy maker development nutritional intervention program support elderly , hospitalization . Study Hypothesis : We hypothesize multidisciplinary nutritional intervention , follow hospitalization , improve dietary intake nutritional status . Improvement nutritional status , turn , cut health care cost decrease use health service .

	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Determine Outcomes Cost Effectiveness Nutritional Intervention Elderly Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hospitalized elderly susceptible nutrition , affect clinical course outcome . We recently find 30 % nutrition 200 inpatient age 65 old . Interestingly , , patient recieved nutritional intervention hospitalize . Objectives : 1 . To develop model nutritional intervention among nourished elderly inpatient . 2 . To determine impact intervention program compare standard care . Prospective outcome include health care use , health nutritional status dietary intake year follow hospitalization . 3 . To assess cost-effectiveness clinical feasibility nutritional intervention propose . Methods : Patients 70 year age , admit Internal Medicine Department Soroka University Hospital screen nutritional risk . Patients risk randomly allocate 3 group : standard care , in-hospital intensive intervention in-hospital community intensive intervention . In year follow hospitalization , health status , health care use , quality life nutritional status assess use validated tool . Importance study : Under nourished patient increase risk medical complication increase duration hospitalization , raise cost care . Intensive nutritional intervention may reduce length stay thus cost . A formalized intervention plan crucial efficacious cost-effective care . We feel acute hospitalization window opportunity initiate long-term nutritional advice follow-up .</detailed_description>
