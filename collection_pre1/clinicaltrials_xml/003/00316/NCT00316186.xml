	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Adequate contraception method include : systemic contraceptive IUD 3 month prior start study medication diaphragm plus spermicide ; male , condom plus spermicide ; total abstinence sexual intercourse course study Women childbearing potential sexually active male must practice use accept effective form contraception Subjects present CNS metastasis eligible , provide attend physician ascertains metastasis control start chemotherapy , subject asymptomatic neurologic exam receive corticosteroid therapy control symptom . Continued use antiseizure medication permit Free active infection At screening , probable life expectancy least 3 month No prior chemotherapy SCLC chemotherapy within 5 year diagnosis SCLC . Prior radiation symptomatic site permit provided indicator lesion site ( ) irradiate , radiation complete chemotherapy start Performance status ECOG 01 Adequate hematologic , renal hepatic function •Hematologic : ANC 1500/mm3 [ 1.5 x 109/L ] , platelet count 100,000/L ( 100 x 109/L ) , hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL Renal : Serum Creatinine ≤1.5mg/dL ( 133mol/L ) CrCl 60 ml/min ( CockroftGault ) [ Cockroft , 1976 ] CrCl may calculate use CockcroftGault formula : CrCl ( ml/min ) = Q x ( 140age [ yr ] ) x body wt [ kg ] 72 x serum creatinine [ mg/dl ] Q = 0.85 female Q = 1.0 male CrCl ( ml/min ) = K x ( 140age [ yr ] ) x body wt [ kg ] Serum creatinine [ mol/L ] K = 1.0 female K = 1.23 male Hepatic : Serum bilirubin ( 1.5 mg/dL ) , SGOT ( AST ) , SGPT ( ALT ) Alkaline Phosphatase 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) liver metastases absent abdominal CT MRI , 5 time ULN liver metastases present At least 18 year old Written inform consent ( subject 's write understanding agreement participate study . Subject histologicallyconfirmed extensive small cell lung cancer unequivocally positive positive cytological evidence ( sputum , least two , aspirate biopsy ) Presence measurable disease accord World Health Organization ( WHO ) * criterion , determine diagnostic test , include CT scan chest abdomen , MRI scan brain , CXR , PET CT , MRI , and/or CXR prefer diagnostic method evaluate disease course study . Use positronemission tomography ( PET ) require , permit standard diagnostic tool employ institution . Measurable disease Presence least one bidimensionally measurable , nonCNS lesion ( indicator lesion ) . If measurable disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature confirm cytology/histology • Measurable disease , either CT MRI scan , require one diameter 1 cm one diameter 2 cm . • Measurable disease CXR require diameter 2 cm . • Palpable tumor mass could evaluate radiologically require two diameter 2 cm At least 3 week since last major surgery ( less period acceptable decide best interest subject ) . Subjects central nervous system metastasis eligible long attend doctor determines metastasis control start chemotherapy , subject symptom spread disease brain , receive drug call steroid control symptom . Laboratory criterion : Subjects must adequate bone marrow reserve adequate kidney liver function . Exclusion criterion : Concurrent plan chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiotherapy , investigational therapy treatment SCLC . ( Concurrent radiation palliation bone metastases CNS lesion must discuss approved GlaxoSmithKline Medical Monitor ) Concurrent severe medical problem diagnosis SCLC , would significantly limit full compliance study expose patient extreme risk Concomitant malignancies previous malignancy SCLC within last 5 year , exception adequately treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix , localize low grade prostate cancer ( contact GlaxoSmithKline Medical Monitor discuss enrolment subject low grade prostate cancer ) Present clinical sign symptom brain and/or leptomeningeal metastasis confirm CT MRI brain scan , corticosteroid treatment control symptoms brain metastasis Uncontrolled infection Ongoing tumor previous tumor lung cancer within last 5 year . Symptoms spread disease brain require treatment drug call steroid Severe medical problem diagnosis SCLC would limit ability subject follow study plan would expose subject extreme risk . Ongoing plan chemotherapy , immunotherapy , radiation treatment , experimental drug therapy treatment SCLC . Use investigational drug within 30 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose study medication Women pregnant lactating . Women become pregnant refuse practice adequate form birth control . Subjects history allergic reaction chemical relate HYCAMTIN PARAPLATIN . Subjects preexist heart disease , congestive heart failure , irregular heartbeat require treatment , heart attack within last 3months .</criteria>
