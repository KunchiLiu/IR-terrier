	<brief_title>Safety Ramelteon Subjects With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 30 % adult population report sleep disturbance 10 % meet diagnostic criterion chronic insomnia . While 20 -25 % individual primary insomnia vast majority additional condition chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Several study look estimate 30 % 48 % general population affect time life form insomnia go several month , one third describe severely affected . Daytime symptoms insomnia include tiredness , lack energy , difficulty concentrate irritability . Recent epidemiologic research focus quality life identify significant insomnia relate condition disease relate work productivity , health care utilization , risk depression . Insomnia associate diminished work output , absenteeism great rate accident . Ramelteon , develop sleep promoting agent base agonism melatonin receptor subtype 1 2 . Ramelteon market United States Rozeremâ„¢ treatment insomnia characterize difficulty sleep initiation . Sleep problem common patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . There evidence traditional hypnotic cause adverse respiratory effect insomniac population respiratory disorder , safety efficacy new hypnotic agent must ascertain group patient . This study examine ramelteon respiratory depressant effect subject moderate severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . Study participation anticipate 6 week .</detailed_description>
