	<brief_title>The Effect Oral Niacinamide Serum Phosphorus Levels Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study compare niacinamide versus placebo reduction serum phosphorus hemodialysis patient . A determination baseline laboratory value ( serum phosphorus , calcium , albumin , biPTH , uric acid , complete blood count ( CBC ) , NMR lipid panel ) precede administration study drug . The study span period 21 week phosphorus level check weekly basis . Phosphorus binder dose remain unchanged unless safety reason . For first 8 week treatment , patient randomize either placebo niacinamide . Both medication administer start dose one capsule twice per day ( BID ) . Niacinamide placebo formulate 250 mg capsule . Placebo package resemble study drug physical attribute . The dose niacinamide placebo increase 500 mg ( 2 capsule ) BID week 3 750 mg ( 3 capsule ) BID week 5 . If hypophosphatemia ( &lt; 3.5 mg/dl ) present , titration occur previous dose continue . However , titration resume subsequent week serum phosphorus great 3.5 mg/dl . After 8 week , patient undergo 2 week washout period , crossover treatment arm placebo , vice versa , week 11 . At begin week 11 , patient cross treatment arm ( either placebo niacinamide ) one capsule ( 250 mg ) twice per day . Subsequent titration occur week 13 week 15 . The treatment phase complete end week 18 . A set lab draw start week 19 , follow two week washout period .</detailed_description>
