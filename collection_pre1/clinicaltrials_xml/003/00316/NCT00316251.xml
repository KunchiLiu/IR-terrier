	<detailed_description>Acute chronic equilibrium disorder result five million patient visit per year United States unknown additional individual seek care . Symptoms dizziness , vertigo , lack balance among common symptom report physician . Equilibrium disorder exclusively due visual vestibular condition typically due problem proprioception . Proprioception specialize sensory modality informs body movement , position , spatial orientation mechanism track sensation accompany joint movement position . Mechanoreceptors joint , along vestibular , visual , muscle spindle , Golgi tendon organ , ligament tendon sensory receptor , comprise propriosensory system , conveys information motor system maintain equilibrium reflexive , automatic basis . Alterations somatosensory input mechanoreceptors identify cause aberrant muscle firing pattern . The NeuroCom Balance Master FDA approve device design measure treat balance problem evaluate neuromuscular control quantify ability maintain dynamic postural stability . The NeuroCom Unit microprocessor control balance unit provide quantitative data regard patient ’ ability control platform . This unit widely use throughout country university clinical setting help patient restore balance .</detailed_description>
