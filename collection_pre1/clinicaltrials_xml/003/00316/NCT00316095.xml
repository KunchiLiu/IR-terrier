	<brief_summary>This study investigate two registered drug , one treatment high blood pressure one treatment elevate cholesterol . High blood pressure ( hypertension ) common medical condition affect million people worldwide . A wide variety effective drug treatment available reduce blood pressure . Elevated cholesterol ( hypercholesterolemia ) common medical condition affect people worldwide . A wide variety effective drug treatment available reduce cholesterol level . Hypertension hypercholesterolemia often occur together . They important risk factor development heart vessel disease ( e.g . heart attack stroke ) . Current guideline advise treatment high blood pressure elevate cholesterol reduce risk cardiovascular disease . This study test simultaneous use drug reduce blood pressure drug reduce elevate cholesterol . Both drug register effective . The drug treatment high blood pressure telmisartan Micardis ) . The drug treatment elevate cholesterol simvastatin ( Zocor ) . Since hypertension hypercholesterolemia frequently occur together , purpose study investigate whether drug use simultaneously . A low dose high dose drug use . It investigate whether drug still effective give together , time day , drug .</brief_summary>
