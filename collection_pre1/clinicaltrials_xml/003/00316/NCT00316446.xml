	<brief_title>Study Determine Incidence Hypoventilation Patients Who Have Undergone Gastric Bypass</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose determine patient clinically significant obesity ( body mass index , BMI , 40 kg/m2 85 kg/m2 ) , undergone gastric bypass procedure general anesthesia hypoventilate initial twenty-four hour postoperative period , , degree . Adequacy ventilation assess serial arterial blood analysis . Patients monitor SpO2 preoperative hold area , operate room , post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) conventional study pulse oximeter . SpO2 data collect continuously record study pulse oximeter entire study period . Arterial blood sample draw analysis every four hour in-dwelling arterial catheter , use standard sterile technique . Hypoventilation define increase PaCO2 five mm Hg patient 's baseline .</detailed_description>
