	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Understanding relationship breast density , level hormone blood , level anticancer drug blood may help improve ability plan effective treatment woman invasive breast cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study relationship breast density blood level hormone anticancer drug woman invasive breast cancer receive exemestane anastrozole .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breast Density , Hormone Levels , Anticancer Drug Levels Women With Invasive Breast Cancer Who Are Receiving Exemestane Anastrozole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Assess change percent breast density dense area response aromatase inhibitor therapy pretreatment 1 year , 1 year 2 year , pretreatment 2 year woman invasive breast cancer . - Determine change percent breast density dense area response aromatase inhibitor therapy pretreatment 1 year correlate change change plasma hormone ( e.g. , estrone , estrone-sulfate , estradiol , sex hormone bind globulin ) drug level ( anastrozole exemestane ) period woman invasive breast cancer . - Determine change time percent breast density dense area ( pretreatment time period prior local recurrence ) contralateral breast correlation local recurrence breast cancer . Secondary - Determine change time percent breast density dense area contralateral breast correlation development contralateral breast cancer . - Determine whether woman high pretreatment percent density ( upper tertile ) experience great decrease percent breast density 1 2 year aromatase inhibitor therapy woman low pretreatment percent density ( low tertile ) . - Determine whether woman high pretreatment dense area ( upper tertile ) experience great decrease dense area 1 2 year aromatase inhibitor therapy woman low pretreatment dense area ( low tertile ) . - Correlate haplotype tag single nucleotide polymorphism gene aromatase pathway ( identify thorough Mayo Clinic Indiana University Pharmacogenomics Research Network Projects ) change percent area breast density , plasma hormone level , 1-year drug level . OUTLINE : This multicenter , companion study . Patients complete 10-minute questionnaire factor might affect change breast density baseline another questionnaire 1 year 2 year post registration . Blood sample collect baseline ( initiation treatment ) 1 year post registration hormone drug level analysis . Mammograms take prior registration ( within 12 month prior enrollment ) approximately 1 2 year post-registration study retrieve digitized determination percent breast density dense area . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 550 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
