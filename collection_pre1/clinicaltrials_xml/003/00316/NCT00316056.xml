	<brief_summary>This study investigate people learn best genetics . It involve participate activity NHGRI 's Immersive Virtual Environment Laboratory ( IVE lab ) , digital `` virtual world '' create appear surround subject wear head-mounted display . English-speaking men woman 18 40 year age may eligible study . Participants randomly assign one two group , receive different type information , IVE lab . Subjects complete questionnaire performing activity lab . The questionnaire evaluate subject 's knowledge genetics test read number skill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study foundation innovative program research design investigate communicate complex concept genomics general public . The focus study one particular concept , idea genetic environmental factor interact affect risk common disease . One objective study examine effect pedagogical modality ( i.e. , learn mode ) conceptual understanding ( i.e. , comprehension ) . A learning-by-doing ( i.e. , self-driven , interactive activity ) condition compare learning-by-assimilation ( i.e. , lecture ) condition assess effect comprehension . The second objective study examine possible moderation hypothesize relationship learn mode comprehension health literacy genetic literacy ( i.e. , literacy skill relate specific content area ) . The third study objective explore possible mediator relationship learn mode comprehension . These experiment conduct NIH Immersive Virtual Environment Testing area order hold presentation medium constant compare two learn mode . 150 participant experimental comparison phase . Because primary focus study general public learn best , study participant healthy adult volunteer without specialized genetics knowledge . Exclusion criterion include self-reported diagnosis epilepsy , vision hearing problem , vestibular disorder ( e.g. , dizziness , vertigo , motion sickness ) . Two learning-by-doing virtual environment ( IVEs ) two learning-by-assimilation IVEs develop pilot test , IVEs best convey idea gene-environment interaction select experimental comparison . Participants randomize one two condition : Learning-by-doing Learning-by-assimilation ; participant complete one IVE . The study two primary outcome , measure comprehension : fourteen-item measure recall ( i.e. , remember content present ) six-item measure transfer ( i.e. , apply content new situation ) . These data provide foundation program research investigate best communicate genomic concept general public , eventually , development effective genomic communication strategy disease prevention intervention .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA All participant study healthy adult volunteer . Eligibility criterion study : ( 1 ) 1840 year age ; ( 2 ) able speak English basic English reading write skill ; ( 3 ) take genetics course past five year . Both men woman include study . We exclude woman last trim pregnancy study , due small chance study participant trip bump wall . Because interested member general public learn best genomic topic , participant study healthy adult . Individuals particularly susceptible motion sickness exclude . Therefore , participant screen follow condition prior enrollment study : selfreported diagnosis epilepsy , low vision , hear problem , vestibular disorder ( e.g. , dizziness , vertigo , motion sickness ) .</criteria>
