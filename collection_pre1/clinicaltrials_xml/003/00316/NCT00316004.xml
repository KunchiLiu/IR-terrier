	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine hypertonic saline without dextran improve neurologic outcome victim severe traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) . Injury lose blood trauma cause body go shock ( low blood pressure relate blood loss ) . This decreased blood flow lead organ damage . In order restore blood pressure blood flow , medic give fluid patient ' vein soon possible . This call `` resuscitation '' . The fluid commonly use `` isotonic '' one salt concentration blood . The investigator try determine infuse `` hypertonic '' fluid one concentrate blood increase blood pressure restore blood flow efficiently . The hypertonic fluid use call hypertonic saline dextran ( HSD ) hypertonic saline ( dextran ) . Hypertonic saline salt solution slightly concentrate blood . Dextran sugar solution .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypertonic Resuscitation Following Severe Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To determine prehospital administration 7.5 % Hypertonic Saline 6 % Dextran-70 ( HSD ) OR 7.5 % Hypertonic Saline ( HS ) compare current standard therapy NS initial resuscitation fluid affect neurological outcome follow severe traumatic brain injury . Trauma lead cause death among North Americans age 1 44 year . The majority death result hypovolemic shock severe brain injury . Patients hypovolemic shock develop state systemic tissue ischemia subsequent reperfusion injury time fluid resuscitation . Conventional resuscitation involve IV administration large volume isotonic slightly hypotonic ( lactated ringer , LR ) solution begin pre-hospital setting . Although conclusive , prior study suggest alternative resuscitation hypertonic saline ( 7.5 % ) solution may reduce morbidity mortality patient . Furthermore , hypertonic fluid may specific advantage brain-injured patient , may aid rapid restoration cerebral perfusion prevent extravascular fluid sequestration , thereby limit secondary brain injury . In addition , recent study demonstrate hypertonicity significantly alter activation inflammatory cell , effect may reduce subsequent organ injury ischemia-reperfusion decrease nosocomial infection . This study randomize , double-blind , three-arm placebo control trial design evaluate clinical outcome trauma patient severe TBI manifest pre-hospital GCS 8 less . Patients randomize single 250cc IV dose 7.5 % saline 6 % Dextran-70 ( HSD ) , 7.5 % saline ( HS ) normal saline initial fluid pre-hospital resuscitation . No additional intervention occur patient admit hospital . In hospital data collection last 28 day . Patients neurologic outcome measurement discharge , 1 month post discharge , 6 month post injury . Enrollment restrict age ≥ 15 year ≥ 50 kg age unknown .</detailed_description>
