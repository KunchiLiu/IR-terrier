	<brief_summary>The initial study [ 123I ] INER complete two part . Once Part A ( Preliminary whole body biodistribution ) complete , Part B ( Serial dynamic SPECT assessment regional brain uptake washout plasma metabolite analysis determine brain penetrance regional distribution washout count follow 123-I INER injection ) commence . All study procedure conduct Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders ( IND ) Molecular NeuroImaging ( MNI ) New Haven , CT. All subject undergo write informed consent screen evaluation include baseline clinical laboratory testing , baseline physical neurological evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All subject receive full physical examination IND determine study eligibility . Written inform consent obtain prior study procedure . The screening procedure include : review medical psychiatric history , review medication , physical examination include height body weight , vital sign measurement , review inclusion/exclusion criterion , clinical laboratory testing ( serum chemistry , CBC , urinalysis , urinary drug screen ) , urine pregnancy test female childbearing potential electrocardiogram preparation image study . Part A : Four healthy subject receive one injection 123-I INER . Serial whole body planar image anterior posterior projection perform 8-9 hour period follow injection 5 mCi 123-I INER 18-24 hour follow injection . Venous blood data acquire imaging time point . In addition 24 hour urine collection commence follow radiotracer injection . Whole body source organ uptake analyze anterior posterior image calculate radiation absorb dos organ . Plasma urine metabolite characterize safety assessment obtain . Serial safety assessment include vital sign , serum chemistry , CBC , urinalysis , EKGs . Part B : Six healthy subject receive one injection 123-I INER . Following bolus intravenous injection 5 mCi 123-I INER 15 second , serial dynamic SPECT brain acquisition obtain evaluate regional brain uptake washout activity . Venous blood measure obtain acquisition characterization 123-I INER metabolite assess . Safety assessment include vital sign , serum chemistry , CBC , urinalysis , EKGs .</detailed_description>
