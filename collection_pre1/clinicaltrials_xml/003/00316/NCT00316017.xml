	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine hypertonic saline without dextran improve overall survival victim trauma shock . Injury lose blood trauma cause body shock ( low blood pressure relate blood loss ) . This decreased blood flow lead organ damage . In order restore blood pressure blood flow , medic give fluid patient ' vein soon possible . This call `` resuscitation . '' The resuscitation fluid commonly use `` isotonic '' one concentration blood . The investigator try determine infuse `` hypertonic '' fluid ( one concentrate blood ) increase blood pressure restore blood flow efficiently . The hypertonic fluid investigator use call hypertonic saline dextran ( HSD ) hypertonic saline ( dextran ) . Hypertonic saline salt solution slightly concentrate blood . Dextran sugar solution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : To determine prehospital administration 7.5 % hypertonic saline /6 % Dextran-70 ( HSD ) OR 7.5 % hypertonic saline alone ( HS ) , compare current standard therapy normal saline ( NS ) , initial resuscitation fluid , affect survival follow traumatic injury hypovolemic shock . Trauma lead cause death among North Americans age 1 44 year . The majority death result hypovolemic shock severe brain injury . Patients hypovolemic shock develop state systemic tissue ischemia subsequent reperfusion injury time fluid resuscitation . Conventional resuscitation involve IV administration large volume isotonic slightly hypotonic ( lactated ringer , LR ) solution begin prehospital setting . Although conclusive , prior study suggest alternative resuscitation hypertonic saline ( 7.5 % ) solution may reduce morbidity mortality patient . Furthermore , hypertonic fluid may specific advantage brain-injured patient , may aid rapid restoration cerebral perfusion prevent extravascular fluid sequestration , thereby limit secondary brain injury . In addition , recent study demonstrate hypertonicity significantly alter activation inflammatory cell , effect may reduce subsequent organ injury ischemia-reperfusion decrease nosocomial infection . The majority previous clinical trial focus use HSD . The potential 7.5 % saline alone ( HS ) similar effect well study . Removal dextran component may enhance anti-inflammatory effect solution , could improve secondary outcome acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , multiple organ failure syndrome ( MOFS ) rate nosocomial infection . This study randomize , double-blind , three-arm placebo control trial design evaluate clinical outcome trauma patient hypovolemic shock , manifest prehospital hypotension . Patients randomize single 250cc IV dose 7.5 % saline 6 % Dextran-70 ( HSD ) , 7.5 % saline ( HS ) normal saline initial fluid prehospital resuscitation . No additional intervention occur patient admit hospital . In hospital data collection last 28 day .</detailed_description>
