	<brief_summary>This study design collection stem cell bloodstream use research study . These cell study determine unique feature particular donor may may affect use develop new treatment . Volunteers without blood disease may eligible donate stem cell study . Women pregnant breastfeeding may enroll . Donors evaluate medical history physical examination , blood test ultrasound examination spleen . They undergo stem cell mobilization apheresis follow : Donors give injection hormone call G-CSF every day 5 day stimulate release stem cell bone marrow bloodstream collection . On day last injection , donor undergo apheresis obtain white cell stem cell . For procedure , blood withdrawn catheter ( plastic tube ) place vein direct machine white cell stem cell separate rest blood spin process . These cell extract collected bag inside machine , rest blood return donor second catheter vein arm . The procedure take 4 5 hour .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent advance area stem cell research suggest redirect differentiation stem cell may prove useful treatment variety diseases include diabetes systemic disease . In hematopoietic system , recent study also demonstrate ability adult erythroid stem cell undergo differentiation toward fetal-like phenotype . This fetal-like phenotype crucial eliminate clinical sequela sickle syndrome beta hemoglobinopathy . However , additional study need determine result apply patient diseases involve hematopoietic stem cell blood cell . In addition , clear stem cell separate donor possess identical property growth differentiation . The immediate aim protocol obtain hematopoietic stem cell many human donor examination biological property cell . The study also design determine donor-specific factor influence property hematopoietic stem cell . Each volunteer undergo stem cell mobilization administration granulocyte-colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) five consecutive day follow large volume apheresis 5th day G-CSF injection . The harvested product purify primitive hematopoietic progenitor cell viably preserve multiple aliquot . The cell study in-depth well understanding biological property , growth differentiation . Donor-specific information correlate research study identify factor may assist understand adult stem cell biology .</detailed_description>
