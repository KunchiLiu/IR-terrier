	<brief_title>Simultaneous Pancreas-kidney Transplantation With Campath Protocol</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Simultaneous pancreas-kidney ( SPK ) transplantation recommend treatment option type 1-diabetic patient suffer end-stage kidney disease.1 Major factor contribute success SPK transplantation include improvement surgical technique provision effective immunosuppressive strategy herald introduction calcineurin inhibitors.2 According International Pancreas Transplant Registry ( IPTR ) , since mid-1990s , popular maintenance therapy Tacrolimus Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) , utilize approximately 66 % SPK transplant recipient . Since 1994 , proportion pancreas recipient receive induction therapy exceed 70 % mean induction therapy use great frequency pancreas recipient solid organ recipient . That accordance registry analyse clinical trial list demonstrate high graft survival rate recipient give antibody induction therapy maintain Tacrolimus . A large European multicenter study compare efficacy safety Tacrolimus versus microemulsion formulation Cyclosporine 205 SPK recipient . All patient receive additionally rabbit anti-T-cell induction therapy , MMF short-term corticosteroid . The study show significantly high pancreas graft survival rate Tacrolimus ( 91 % ) Cyclosporine ( 74 % ; P &lt; 0.0005 ) .3 A second US multicenter study focus effect antibody induction therapy SPK recipient . The trial conduct 18 US pancreas transplant center , randomize 87 recipient antibody induction therapy versus therapy . In induction group , either T-cell depleting nondepleting antibody use . Maintenance therapy group Tacrolimus , MMF steroid . At 3 year , actual patient survival rate ( 94 % vs. 90 % ) pancreas graft survival rate ( 76 % vs. 76 % ) similar two group , actual kidney survival rate significantly high induction group ( 92 % vs. 82 % ; P=0.04 ) .4 A third US-Canadian multicenter study assess safety efficacy two dosing regimen daclizumab versus antibody induction 185 SPK recipient maintain Tacrolimus , MMF steroid . The probability either kidney pancreas rejection low two dos daclizumab ( P=0.042 ) . The author conclude daclizumab effective reduce incidence acute rejection SPK recipient , compare antibody induction.5 During past year increasingly center investigate usage Campath-1H induction therapy combination calcineurin inhibitor , MMF absence short course steroid . A recent single-centre , retrospective study SPK transplant recipient involve two treatment arm Campath ( n=50 ) Thymoglobuline ( n=58 ) . The induction dose Campath 30mg 6mg/kg Thymoglobuline . Additionally recipients receive prednisone-free maintenance immunosuppressive regimen Tacrolimus Sirolimus MMF . The 3-year patient graft survival excellent similar treatment arm . The mean creatinine value 1-year post-transplant however low Campath subgroup ( 1.30 vs. 1.44 mg/dL ) . Furthermore advantage Campath show trend decrease rate CMV infection , PTLD also less expensive.6 The purpose study evaluate Campath-1H precondition Tacrolimus monotherapy pancreas transplant recipient . Thirty-seven consecutive pancreas transplant ( 20 SPK , 10 PAK 7 PTA ) follow 7 month , utilize 30mg Campath-1H preconditioning . Two gram intravenous methylprednisolone administer , one prior start Campath-1H another reperfusion . Patient survival 100 % . Pancreas kidney graft survival 94 % 90 % , respectively . Interestingly , rejection episode precede tacrolimus trough level &lt; 9.0 ng/ml extended period time , allograft rejection observe pancreas kidney tacrolimus &gt; 10 ng/ml . During study period infectious complication see . Although follow-up short , result suggest regimen Campath-1H induction tacrolimus monotherapy represent effective immunosuppressive protocol pancreas transplant recipients.7 As demonstrated , increase number transplant centre propose withdraw avoid steroid , nevertheless calcineurin inhibitor remain backbone immunosuppressive protocol . The use antibody induction therapy pancreas transplant recipient guide practical experience , absence randomise prospective trials.8 A multicenter trial involve 130 kidney transplant recipient start center , investigate safety efficacy Campath-1H combination Tacrolimus monotherapy compare standard Tacrolimus/MMF/steroid regimen , demonstrate excellent result virtually complication side effect Tacrolimus monotherapy Campath-1H induction . Based exist clinical trial experience Campath-1H therapy center would like investigate long-term safety efficacy Campath-1H induction Tacrolimus monotherapy compare standard regimen ATG induction , Tacrolimus , MMF short term steroid control , prospective , randomised trial .</detailed_description>
