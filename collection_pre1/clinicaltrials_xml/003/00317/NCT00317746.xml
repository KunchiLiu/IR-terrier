	<brief_summary>With improved prognosis human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , end stage liver disease due hepatitis C ( HCV ) represent major cause morbidity mortality people HIV . Treatment HCV become increasingly important mean prevent consequence chronic HCV infection . Paradoxically , co-infected patient low rate treatment initiation completion large part high risk develop neuropsychiatric symptom receive PEG-interferon ( PEG-IFN ) . There large number co-infected individual Canada could benefit HCV therapy tolerability could improve . This trial address whether prophylactic use antidepressant HIV-HCV infect patient initiate HCV therapy prevent development neuropsychiatric side effect thus permit patient receive full treatment HCV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Citalopram Prevention Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trial design : This study Canadian multicentre randomize , double-blind placebo control trial . We evaluate whether prophylactic citalopram compare symptomatic treatment depression significantly increase amount HCV therapy receive co-infected patient first 24 week . Post study follow-up extend 6 month cessation HCV therapy ( 72 week ) capture information SVR ( sustain virologic response ) HCV . 76 patient randomize 1:1 ratio citalopram placebo . Patients stratify study centre HCV genotype . Citalopram ( placebo ) begin 3 week HCV treatment initial dose 10 mg per day increase 20 mg per day one week continue throughout treatment PEG-IFN/ribavirin ( 48 week ) taper discontinuation completion HCV therapy . The management depression emerge study participant mandate protocol ensure original treatment assignment remain blinded allow subject remain study mimic would take place clinical practice . Analysis : The analysis follow intention-to-treat approach . Random regression model employ analyse longitudinal data adherence prescribe PEG-IFN ribavirin dosage week 12 24 . Survival analysis use compare two treatment group respect time development depression . Implications : Prophylactic antidepressant may prevent overt depression may also diminish development sub-clinical depressed mood . Effective prevention broad range neuropsychiatric symptom use citalopram potential diminish morbidity associate PEG-IFN treatment consequently allow great number patient complete full therapy . In addition , approach may help patient remain adherent HIV therapy course HCV treatment could long-term personal public health implication prevent emergence HIV resistance . Furthermore , show effective strategy prevent neuropsychiatric symptom , treatment HCV may become accessible large number patient may ready access frequent intensive psychiatric monitoring , necessary early detection treatment depression manifest PEG-IFN .</detailed_description>
