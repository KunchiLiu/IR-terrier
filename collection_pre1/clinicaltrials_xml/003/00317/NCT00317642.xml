	<brief_summary>Clofarabine ( injection ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment pediatric patient 1 21 year old relapse acute refractory lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) least 2 prior treatment regimen . There recommended standard treatment relapse refractory acute myelogenous leukemia old patient . Cytarabine commonly use drug treat patient . This study determine benefit combine clofarabine cytarabine . Patients randomize receive 3 cycle treatment either placebo combination cytarabine clofarabine combination cytarabine . Randomization stratify remission status follow first induction regimen ( remission [ i.e. , CR1 = refractory ] remission &lt; 6 month vs CR1 = remission ≥6 month ) . CR1 define remission first pre-study induction regimen . The safety tolerability clofarabine combination cytarabine cytarabine alone monitor throughout study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Clofarabine Cytarabine Older Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia ( AML ) ( CLASSIC I )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After screen eligibility assessment , patient randomize ( 1:1 ratio ) receive either clofarabine match placebo , addition cytarabine . Randomization stratify remission status follow first induction regimen ( CR1 ) : remission [ i.e. , CR1 = refractory ] remission &lt; 6 month vs remission ≥6 month . During randomization interactive voice response system ( IVRS ) , 10 participant misclassified CR1 &lt; 6 month stratum 12 participant misclassified CR1 ≥6 month stratum . The error affect participant ' treatment , stratification . Due misclassification , outcome use strata analysis analyze twice : 'randomized stratification ' include misclassification 'calculated stratification ' participant appear 'correct ' stratum . Two clinical study report write study . 1 . Clinical study report date 7 April 2011 include entire treatment period participant plus much follow-up . At time , 33 participant Clofarabine+cytarabine group 29 participant placebo+cytarabine group still follow-up post treatment . Results report clinicaltrials.gov August 2011 . Outcomes use strata report 'calculated stratum ' clinicaltrials.gov . 2 . Clinical study report date 9 July 2012 include patient treatment experience plus long-term follow-up ( minimum 2 year end treatment patient die ) . The study complete time . Outcomes use strata report 'randomized stratum ' clinicaltrials.gov . AE record clinicaltrials.gov reflect final database . Outcomes change two clinical study report due additional long-term follow-up data report twice clinicaltrials.gov ( clinical study report ) appropriate report date include outcome description . Outcomes 9 July 2012 report represent complete data .</detailed_description>
