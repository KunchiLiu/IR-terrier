	<brief_summary>The purpose trial test safety vaccine make patient 's breast cancer cell , determine vaccine delay stop growth cancer . The vaccine make genetically modify patient 's tumor cell secrete granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) activate immune response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccination With Autologous Breast Cancer Cells Engineered Secrete Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After patient give consent participate trial , series test perform determine patient eligible . These test may take place 21 day surgery remove tumor sample cancer-containing fluid , use create vaccine . The tumor cell fluid bring special , certified laboratory vaccine make . Specially trained laboratory technician use method know adenoviral mediate gene transfer , add new gene cancer cell . This gene cause cell make GM-CSF , powerful hormone stimulate immune system . The cell give radiation grow . Participants start receive vaccine day 1 , 8 , 15 , 29 , every two week supply vaccine run . The amount vaccine depend upon total amount cell obtain breast cancer tumor fluid . Each time patient vaccinate , give injection place underneath skin . A different place use injection . If enough cell patient 's tumor sample , patient give injection non-transduced irradiated cell ( gene add ) . These cell help measure patient 's immune system react tumor cell . This call Delayed-Type Hypersensitivity ( DTH ) . With vaccine # 1 # 5 , patient also receive DTH injection . Two three day vaccine DTH injection , skin biopsy take site . At week 10 study treatment , early necessary , patient chest , abdomen , pelvic CT scan determine vaccine therapy effect disease . A brain MRI perform abnormality first brain MRI new symptom develop . Patients may participate study one follow happens : All vaccine create tumor give patient ; patient 's disease worsen ; patient experience unacceptable and/or harmful side effect ; patient unable follow study plan ; patient 's doctor feel longer best interest patient continue .</detailed_description>
