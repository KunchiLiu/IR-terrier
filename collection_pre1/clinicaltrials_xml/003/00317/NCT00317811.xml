	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , melphalan , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Ascorbic acid may help melphalan work well make cancer cell sensitive drug . Giving bortezomib together ascorbic acid melphalan may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together ascorbic acid melphalan work treat patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine overall response rate ( combined complete response [ CR ] , near CR , partial response [ PR ] , minimal response [ MR ] ) time progression disease patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma treat bortezomib , ascorbic acid , melphalan . - Assess safety tolerability regimen patient . Secondary - Assess time response patient . - Determine progression-free overall survival patient . - Assess time disease progression among subject continue maintenance treatment bortezomib . OUTLINE : This open-label study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 oral melphalan oral ascorbic acid day 1-4 . Treatment repeat every 28 day maximum response [ MR ] least 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond disease receive additional 2 course induction therapy beyond MR proceed maintenance therapy . Patients stable disease without maximum reduction paraprotein 8 course induction therapy eligible receive maintenance therapy . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
