	<brief_summary>The purpose study , patient rheumatoid arthritis incomplete response etanercept methotrexate ( MTX ) , evaluate : safety evidence therapeutic benefit infliximab methotrexate , level ( pharmacokinetics ) etanercept infliximab antibody ( immunogenicity ) etanercept infliximab patient blood , whether switch etanercept infliximab change progression structural damage study period , whether specific marker blood ( pharmacodynamics ) correlate therapeutic response benefit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-label , Pilot Protocol Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis Who Switch Infliximab After Incomplete Response Etanercept</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Therapeutic agent design bind block biological activity tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFa ) show effective treatment rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Two anti-TNFa agent currently market treatment RA ; etanercept ( Enbrel® ) infliximab ( REMICADE® ) . Clinical trial show agent rapidly improve sign symptom associate RA majority patient . Moreover , slow , may even arrest improve , joint structural damage accompanies RA . While infliximab etanercept design block biological activity TNFa , agents sufficiently different structure may distinct , well overlap , mechanisms action . The clear evidence possibility infer differential activity certain disease Crohn 's disease infliximab , etanercept , show beneficial therapeutic activity . The mechanism differential biological activity know . That infliximab etanercept show differential activity diseases suggests may also distinct effect RA . The question whether patient fail respond incompletely respond etanercept still respond infliximab potentially important therapeutic implication . Evidence patient respond infliximab could support notion agent important difference mechanisms action , could explain presence antibody etanercept . More importantly , would suggest therapeutic failure one TNFa-blocker necessarily predict failure TNFa-targeting agent . Such finding could open important therapeutic alternative RA patient clear importance class biologics ( biologic agent ) represent significant advance date treatment RA . This initial open-label , pilot study perform approximately 24 patient RA achieve therapeutic benefit treatment concomitant etanercept MTX minimum 3 month , response must incomplete response , patient must minimum 9 tender 6 swollen joint receive concomitant etanercept MTX . It assess safety evidence therapeutic benefit infliximab patient population . The study examine difference pharmacokinetics immunogenicity etanercept infliximab patient incomplete responder etanercept . This open-label , exploratory study formal hypothesis test . This study provide preliminary assessment safety evidence therapeutic benefit infliximab plus MTX patient RA incomplete responder etanercept plus MTX . One group receive intravenous infliximab infusion dose 3 mg/kg week 0 , 2 , 6 14 22 . The second group receive etanercept injection , 25 mg subcutaneously twice weekly week 0 16 may receive intravenous infliximab infusion 3 mg/kg week 16 , 18 &amp; 22 .</detailed_description>
