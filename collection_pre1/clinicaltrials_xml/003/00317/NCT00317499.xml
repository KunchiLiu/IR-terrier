	<detailed_description>Previously present data 2 double-blind , placebo-controlled trial ( Protocols 016.0612 [ Investigator IND ] 016.0030 [ Immunex IND ] ) lead approval etanercept reduce clinical sign symptom PsA . One-year radiographic data Protocol 20021630 lead additional approval etanercept inhibit structural progression PsA . Data use follow purpose : - To summarize clinical efficacy safety result previously describe 6-month clinical study report radiographic result previously describe 1-year clinical study report . - To show effect etanercept physical function subject PsA psoriasis , measure 2 patient-reported outcome measure ( disability index Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire [ HAQ ] Medical Outcomes Study Short-form Health Survey [ SF-36 ] ) . • To present radiographic result 2 year baseline final clinical efficacy safety result open-label period study .</detailed_description>
