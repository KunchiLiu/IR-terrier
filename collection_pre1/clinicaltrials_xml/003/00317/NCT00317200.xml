	<brief_summary>Improvements therapy relapse SCLC much need . Paclitaxel previously test found significant single agent activity relapse SCLC , include refractory patient . Angiogenesis play important role SCLC , increase VEGF level associate bad outcome . Bevacizumab , monoclonal antibody VEGF , increase response rate survival combine chemotherapy agent compare chemotherapy agent alone NSCLC , breast cancer , colorectal cancer . Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab , dose schedule propose study , improve response rate progression free survival compare paclitaxel alone woman metastatic breast cancer . Therefore , test safety , feasibility , efficacy regimen patient chemosensitive relapse SCLC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Paclitaxel Plus Bevacizumab Patients With Chemosensitive Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . Paclitaxel 90 mg/m2 IV infusion 1 hour day 1 , 8 15 28 day cycle Plus Bevacizumab 10 mg/kg day 1 15 28 day cycle . - 1 cycle = 28 day ( 4 week ) - Disease assessment perform per RECIST every cycle - After minimum 4 cycle maximum 6 cycle combination chemotherapy , bevacizumab monotherapy may continue disease progression intolerable side effect ECOG Performance Status 0 1 Hematopoietic : - White blood cell count &gt; 3,000 mm3 - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,500 mm3 - Platelet count &gt; 100,000 mm3 - International normalized ration ( INR ) prothrombin time ≤ 1.2 - PTT 5 second longer ULN Hepatic : - Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST , SGOT ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN Renal : - Urine protein : creatinine ratio &lt; 1.0 Cardiovascular : - No history myocardial infarction angina pectoris/anginal equivalent last 6 month . Note : The patient may anti-anginal medication symptom entirely control great 6 month . - No history uncontrolled congestive heart failure uncontrolled hypertension</detailed_description>
