	<brief_summary>The objective study treat anemic ( Hemoglobin ( Hb ) &lt; 12 g/dL ) HIV-infected subject weekly ( QW ) PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) target Hb &gt; 13 g/dL ass target Hb level improvement Quality Life ( QOL ) could maintain every week ( Q2W ) PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) dosing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Study Evaluate Effect Every Other Week PROCRITï¿½ ( Epoetin Alfa ) Dosing ( 40,000-60,000 Units ) On Maintaining Quality Life Target Hemoglobin Levels Anemic HIV-Infected Patients ( CHAMPS II )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase IV , open-label , non-randomized , multi-center study conduct community base practice , physician network , academic institution US . This study include anemic ( Hb &lt; 12 g/dL ) HIV-infected subject HIV/hepatitis C ( HCV ) co-infected subject receive HCV treatment stable anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) regimen least 4 week prior enrollment . Quality life assessment , laboratory result , transfusion information obtain study . Laboratory test , vital sign ( blood pressure ) , incidence severity adverse event collect assess . The primary objective study ass every week PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) dose maintain quality life anemic HIV-infected patient . The primary hypothesis interest mean quality life score ( measure MOS-HIV General Health Perception score ) end every week ( Q2W ) maintenance phase lower begin maintenance phase 7 point . It anticipate less frequent dosing , every week , convenient patient improve patient compliance . The start dose ( Baseline/Study Day 1 ) PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) eligible subject 40,000 U give subcutaneously QW . The maximum duration 24 week . Subjects achieve target Hb level &gt; = 13 g/dL convert maintenance dose PROCRIT ( Epoetin alfa ) sc Q2W .</detailed_description>
