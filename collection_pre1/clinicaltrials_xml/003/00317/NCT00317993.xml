	<brief_title>LDL Receptor Under Ezetimibe Simvastatin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ezetimibe decrease serum total LDL cholesterol level block cholesterol absorption intestine , cause compensatory increase cholesterol synthesis . The exact underlying regulatory mechanism ezetimibe-induced increase cholesterol synthesis decrease serum LDL cholesterol know . In addition , never investigate whether change LDL receptor expression contribute LDL-lowering effect ezetimibe , case agent cause decrease cholesterol absorption plant stanols . In present study , plan examine change LDL receptor HMG-CoA reductase mRNA concentration ezetimibe treatment . For comparison , effect simvastatin combine administration two investigate . Since mRNA expression profile provide information effect transcriptional necessarily translational level , also analyze change LDL receptor protein cell surface mononuclear blood cell . As functional marker HMG-CoA reductase activity ratio serum lathosterol cholesterol concentration use since correlate HMG-CoA reductase activity serve also marker total cholesterol synthesis . In regard show plant sterol , also act block intestinal cholesterol absorption , increase cholesterol synthesis , decrease LDL synthesis , increase LDL receptor mRNA level well LDL receptor protein concentration significant effect HMG-CoA reductase expression activity peripheral blood mononuclear cell . Aim prospective ran-domized parallel study examine change HMG-CoA reductase activity/expression LDL receptor expression/protein concentration mononuclear blood cell treatment ezetimibe . For purpose 3 parallel group 20 healthy men form . One group treat ezetimibe ( 10 mg/day ) , one 40 mg/day simvastatin another ezetimibe ( 10 mg/day ) plus simvastatin ( 40 mg/day ) . Each treatment period last 2 week . Blood draw per-formed baseline ( initiation treatment ) end 2 week . ( store sample -80Â° ) . The measurement involve study include determination lipopro-tein concentration serum , isolation mononuclear cell , measurement LDL receptor mRNA peripheral blood mononuclear cell , measurement HMG-CoA reductase mRNA level peripheral blood mononuclear cell , measurement LDL-receptor protein concentration surface peripheral blood mononuclear cell . Furthermore , serum latosterol cholesterol con-centrations measure surrogate marker HMG-CoA reductase activity .</detailed_description>
