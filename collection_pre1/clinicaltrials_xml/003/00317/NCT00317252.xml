	<brief_title>Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors &amp; Contrast Induced Nephropathy Patients Receiving Cardiac Catheterization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There approximately 4000 coronary angiogram perform annually Hamilton General Hospital diagnose treat coronary artery disease . Many patient undergoing procedure mild kidney disease . Exposure contrast dye use procedure put risk worsen kidney function , condition call contrast induce nephropathy ( CIN ) associate significant morbidity mortality . Many patient also antihypertensive drug call angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARB ) . Their effect kidney contrast exposure know . Our understanding drug work lead u believe use drug around time contrast exposure may detrimental effect kidney . The purpose study determine patient continue take stop take ACE inhibitor ARB around time angiogram order prevent CIN . Patients undergo elective coronary angiogram mild kidney disease currently take ACE inhibitor ARB randomly divide two group . One group continue take ACE inhibitor ARB group stop take ACE inhibitor ARB least 24 hour resume ACE inhibitor ARB 48 96 hour angiogram . In group , kidney function assess mean simple blood test 48 96 hour angiogram . By , determine group kidney damage group less kidney damage contrast exposure . We suspect patient take ACE inhibitor around time angiogram less kidney damage . All patient receive accepted measure prevent kidney disease contrast dye exposure . CIN associate significant morbidity mortality . If use ACEIs coronary angiogram associate increase risk CIN , patient may benefit hold ACEI around time procedure potentially improve outcomes . This low cost intervention could potentially change practice , reduce morbidity , save life pave way large clinical trial .</detailed_description>
