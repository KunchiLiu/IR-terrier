	<brief_summary>Sciatica ( lumbosacral radiculopathy ) common diagnosis primary care , occur approximately one percent patient acute low back pain . ( 1 , 2 ) Traditional treatment generally involve pain control ( acetominophen , NSAID ’ , narcotic ) , activity tolerate , time . ( 1 , 3-8 ) The general consensus fifty percent patient sciatica recover within six week , ninety percent well twelve week . ( 4 , 8 ) Those patient intractable pain progressive neurologic symptom usually receive epidural steroid injection , necessary , decompressive laminectomy discectomy . ( 2 , 8 , 9 ) Low back pain sciatica result tremendous loss society term decrease productivity cost treatment . ( 1 , 12 ) Oral steroid inexpensive relatively safe medication , effective reduce pain disability associate sciatica , could improve quality patient ’ life , result significant cost saving society large . We hypothesize use oral steroid treat acute sciatica speed patient ’ recovery measure : change physical finding , rate return work activity daily live , pain disability assessment score , decrease use narcotic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ’ ) , need epidural injection surgical intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inclusion Criteria To include study patient diagnosis acute sciatica determine principle investigator base follow criterion : unilateral leg pain extend knee ( without strength , sensory , reflex change ) , positive straight leg raise sign ( define pain radiate buttock knee elevation leg zero sixty degree ) . Patients twenty sixty year age , enter [ recruit ] study within one week onset symptom . Exclusion Criteria Patients exclude study pregnant history diabetes , renal failure , upper gastro-intestinal bleed , major psychiatric disease . Patients also free symptom suggest serious underlying disease define United States Agency Healthcare Policy Research document : “ Acute Low Back Problems In Adults ” . ( 11 ) “ Red Flag ” symptom ” include : history cancer , unexplained weight loss , fever chill , night sweat , history intravenous drug use , saddle anesthesia , bowel bladder incontinence , bone pathology , Neurologic emergency . Additionally , patient could exclude condition principle investigator think might jeopardize safety . Randomization Blinding Once diagnosis acute sciatica confirm , subject randomize receive either nine day taper course prednisone placebo capsule . The principle investigator research nurse blind group assignment . All subject receive current standard therapy sciatica , include : NSAID ( ibuprofen , naproxen , etodolac , nambumetone ) , narcotic need ( hydrocodone , propoxyphene , oxycodone , morphine ) , activity tolerate , referral physical therapy . Study Design Upon enter study patient underwent physical exam attention : straight leg raise test ( positive negative ) , contralateral straight leg raising ( positive negative ) , knee ankle stretch reflex ( 0-3+ ) , foot sensation ( normal decrease ) , strength ( 0-5 ) quadriceps , foot dorsiflexors , foot plantar flexor , ability perform five heel lift ( 0-5 ) . Patients also complete three write instrument : “ 12 Item Health Status Questionnaire ” ( 13 ) , “ Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire ” ( 14 ) , “ Roland-Morris Pain Rating Scale ” ( 14 ) . Also note intake visit subsequent visit number hour patient work , employ retire , estimate percent daily living activity able accomplish . Lastly , note make whether patient undergone epidural steroid injection surgical intervention since previous visit . Each patient underwent exam complete questionnaire weekly four week post recruitment , monthly five month . This lead total 6 month follow-up . All patient receive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication narcotic medication need pain control . Patients randomize study group receive taper course prednisone : 60 mg three day , 40 mg three day , 20 mg three day . Patients randomize control ( placebo ) group receive capsule identical appearance prednisone capsule contain inert filler substance . Patients question visit determine whether take study medication ( first nine day study ) whether still take non-steroidal narcotic medication ( entire study ) . Patients encourage begin non-weight-bearing aerobic activity swim and/or bike rid soon pain subside reasonable degree . At point , patient generally also refer see physical therapist . Patients rapid improvement fifty generally image study perform . Project staff order plain film lumbosacral spine patient age 50 . Irrespective age , patient intractable pain progressive neurologic symptom generally plain film lumbosacral spine do also underwent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . A separate analysis pain level rating , narcotic NSAID use , return work rate , perform subgroup thought probably represent patient severe nerve root inflammation effect oral prednisone might less obvious group . Statistical power analysis Statistical power analysis perform primary outcome return work within 14 day intervention . The proportion control group return work hypothesize 50 % . Oral prednisone hypothesize 50 % treatment effect , result 75 % rate return work within 14 day . Using chi square continuity correction , statistical power analysis find ( study control group ) sample size 80 per subgroup would power 88 % find difference ( i.e. , 50 % 75 % ) statistically significant p &lt; .05 .</detailed_description>
