	<brief_title>Coronary Bypass Surgery Trial : Complete Arterial Revascularization Conventional Coronary Artery Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery surgery effectively relieve angina prolongs life certain patient subset . It frequently perform major surgical procedure therefore profound economical impact . Unfortunately angina return 10 20 percent patient five year 50 percent 10 year primarily graft failure progression atherosclerosis native coronary artery . Serial angiography reveals 15-30 percent vein graft stenosed one year nearly 50 percent occlude ten year . Recurrence angina associate increased risk late myocardial infarction reoperation . Reoperations cardiac surgery carry significantly increase risk morbidity mortality due increase patient age , progression coronary atherosclerosis , frequently reduce leave ventricular function technical difficulty . Thus prevention restenosis medical surgical mean eminent importance.The use IMA graft LAD proven reduce long-term mortality patient CABG throughout 15 year follow-up period age group . This data improve survival bilateral IMA grafting suggest increased interest surgical community total arterial revascularization use IMAs various arterial conduit . However date conclusive data demonstrate clinical benefit total arterial revascularization.Reports available complete arterial revascularisation either single institution / single surgeon , retrospective non - randomize . Data base daily decision make large different surgical period different technique use . Improved understanding pathogenic process lead graft occlusion lead rigorous use antiplatelet drug lipid lowering may significantly improve vein graft patency rate slow halt progression native coronary artery atherosclerosis future . The scientific hypothesis underlie randomized multicenter trial : 1 . With respect primary outcome variable “ total mortality ” complete arterial revascularisation cause significantly high mortality 5 year follow-up ( compare conventional coronary artery surgery ) i.e . non-inferiority due increase tecnical complexity surgical procedure . 2 . In term combine secondary outcome variable “ cardiac death , nonfatal myocardial infarction re-revascularisation ( PTCA CABG ) ” additional outcome variable “ freedom angina , functional status quality life ” complete arterial revascularisation show clear benefit .</detailed_description>
