	<brief_title>Effect Regular Sildenafil Blood Pressure Arterial Function Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inhibitors phosphodiesterase type 5 ( PDE5 ) , sildenafil , relax blood vessel . In penis facilitates erection sildenafil proved effective treatment male erectile dysfunction . To date , work effect sildenafil blood pressure mainly investigate single dose study . These show sildenafil cause modest reduction blood pressure , even take blood pressure-lowering drug , provide reassurance safety take single dose erectile dysfunction . However , study offer insight potential PDE5 inhibition long-term treatment hypertension . We address question investigate effect regular administration sildenafil blood pressure . It may also postulate , mechanism action , sildenafil also improve function endothelium , single layer cell line blood vessel . Therefore , effect regular sildenafil endothelial function hypertension also investigate study . The study perform randomise , placebo-controlled , double blind , 2-way crossover manner . Sildenafil match placebo take three time daily 2 week , washout least 6 day treatment . Measurements make acutely ( 1 hour oral sildenafil ) heart rate , blood pressure , pulse wave analysis ( measure wave reflection artery ) , pulse wave velocity ( measure arterial stiffness ) flow-mediated dilatation ( measure endothelial function ) . These measurement repeat 2 week later ( 1 hour oral sildenafil ) . In addition , ambulatory blood pressure record 2 week treatment ( baseline ambulatory BP take record make diagnosis ) .</detailed_description>
