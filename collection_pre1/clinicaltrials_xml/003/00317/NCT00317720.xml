	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To identify optimal dose pharmacokinetics RAD001 combination trastuzumab Phase I trial 2 . To determine efficacy RAD001 plus trastuzumab HER-2-overexpressing patient resistance trastuzumab-based therapy metastatic breast cancer Phase II trial . 1 . Trastuzumab resistance define development progressive disease trastuzumab-based therapy metastatic breast cancer . Patients develop metastasis receive adjuvant neoadjuvant trastuzumab eligible . 2 . Efficacy would measure rate objective response plus stable disease last 6 month ( complete response ( CR ) + partial response ( PR ) + stable disease SD ) . Secondary objective : 1 . To determine pharmacokinetics RAD001 combination trastuzumab . In phase II portion study , pharmacokinetic study optional . 2 . To determine nature degree toxicity RAD001 combination trastuzumab cohort patient 3 . To determine expression level total phosphorylated mTOR p70S6K-T389-P well relevant downstream signal component ( e.g. , S6 , 4E-BP1 ) pre- post- treatment tumor sample . 4 . To correlate biomarker expression response therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>RAD001 new drug design block protein important development growth cancer . It may also stop growth new blood vessel help tumor growth , result cell death . Trastuzumab monoclonal antibody bind HER-2 molecule surface cancer cell . It bind cell HER-2 molecule . Trastuzumab slow growth cancer cell also make able treated chemotherapy drug . Before begin receive study drug , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history record , physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) perform . Routine blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) collect within 1 week therapy . Cancer tissue take time initial diagnosis surgery collect . Special stain do help find way researcher predict response cancer trastuzumab plus RAD001 . Women able child must negative urine pregnancy test . Some participant may need x-ray and/or positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan receive study drug within 3 week start therapy . If find eligible take part study , receive RAD001 tablet mouth day . Every 3 week ( 21 day ) consider 1 course study . The dose trastuzumab receive study different receive study start . If participate Phase I portion study , 4 teaspoon blood draw start study Day 1 . Blood sample draw prior initiation treatment 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 , 24 hour . You also around 4 teaspoon blood draw Day 15 ( start treatment 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 8 , 24 hour ) . While study , weekly blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) first 3 week . After 3 week , tolerate study drug well , blood test ( 2 teaspoon time ) drawn every 3 week , often physicians feel necessary . Six ( 6 ) week first cycle study drug , undergo x-ray , compute tomography ( CT ) scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , PET scan see respond study drug . If disease show response study drug stable , future x-ray , CT scan , MRI PET scan perform every 6 week , often physician feel necessary . After , scan perform every 9 week , often physician feel necessary . A physical exam , include vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , do every 3 week time physician feel necessary . You continue take study drug long continue benefit . You may remove study respond 2 course study drug , intolerable side effect occur , disease get bad . Your dose may lower certain side effect occur . Once come study , physical exam , measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , blood test ( 2 teaspoon ) , x-rays , and/or scan do . This investigational study . Trastuzumab commercially available use single therapy combination paclitaxel . However , combination trastuzumab RAD001 experimental . The FDA authorize RAD001 use research . Up 47 patient take part multicenter study . Up 36 enrol UT MD Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . History biopsyproven HER2overexpressing breast cancer radiographic evidence metastatic disease . The HER2 status determine either immunohistochemistry ( score , 3+ ) fluorescence situ hybridization . 2 . History trastuzumab resistance , define development progressive disease trastuzumabbased therapy metastatic breast cancer . Patient may receive 2 prior trastuzumabbased regimens one lapatinibbased regimen ( either single agent combination chemotherapy ) metastatic breast cancer . Patients develop metastatic disease adjuvant neoadjuvant trastuzumab eligible . 3 . Performance status 02 ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) scale ) . 4 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 1500/µl high ; Platelets 100,000/µl high ; Hemoglobin 9.0 gm/dL high ; Serum creatinine 2.0 mg/dL low ; Total bilirubin 1.5 mg/dL low ; Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) 3* upper limit normal ; Alkaline phosphatase 3* upper limit normal ; Calcium 11.0 mg/dL low . 5 .

A pregnancy test obtain patient woman childbearing potential , define sexually mature woman undergone hysterectomy naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . 7 . Patients must sign informed consent document state understand investigational nature propose treatment . 8 . Patients must measurable disease use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension long diameter &gt; /= 20 mm use conventional technique &gt; /= 10 mm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan . 9 . Patients may receive investigational agent , must receive investigational agent within 15 day enrollment . 10 . Left ventricular ejection fraction determine echocardiogram multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) ( cardiac scan ) must 50 % high . 1 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement 2 . Prior treatment investigational drug within precede 15 day 3 . Chronic treatment systemic steroid another immunosuppressive agent 4 .
