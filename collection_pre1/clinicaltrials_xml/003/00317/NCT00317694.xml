	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Magnesium Iron Hydroxycarbonate Reduction High Blood Phosphate Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High level phosphate blood link serious effect , due calcium imbalance ( high level parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , bone disease , formation calcium deposit body , blood-vessel disease ) . Current guideline indicate blood phosphorus level maintain 1.13 1.78 mmol/L patient receive hemodialysis . This study design investigate magnesium iron hydroxycarbonate 's ability lower control patient ' blood phosphate recommend level compare average blood phosphate , calcium , calcium-phosphate product , PTH magnesium concentration overall safety placebo ( `` dummy '' ) tablet .</detailed_description>
