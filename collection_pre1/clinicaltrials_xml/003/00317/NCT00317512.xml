	<brief_title>Pilot Study Hemoglobin Based Oxygen Therapeutics Elective Coronary Revascularization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute coronary syndrome due acute subacute primary reduction myocardial oxygen supply provoke disruption atherosclerotic plaque associate inflammation , thrombosis , vasoconstriction microembolization . Occlusive thrombosis superimpose ruptured atheroma epicardial coronary artery firmly establish immediate cause acute ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) . Rapid restoration blood flow ( oxygen supply ) jeopardize myocardium limit necrosis reduce mortality . This accomplish medically thrombolytic agent , mechanically , so-called primary balloon angioplasty stenting . Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) become preferred therapy STEMI develop country . HBOC-201 solution belong new class biologic oxygen therapeutic , hemoglobin base oxygen carrier . HBOC-201 crosslinked glutaraldehyde-polymerized hemoglobin ( Hb ) extract isolated bovine red blood cell . On gram-for-gram basis , HBOC-201 calculate approximately three time potent stored fresh red blood cell hemoglobin restore baseline tissue oxygenation follow severe acute anemia . Evaluation Hemoglobin Based Oxygen Carrier undertaken 57 preclinical study 21 human clinical trial . The compound review US FDA approve Republic South Africa . However , HBOC-201 yet evaluate set disease ( narrow coronary artery ) . Biopure study safety feasibility HBOC-201 patient typical symptom Unstable Angina Non ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction eligible undergo invasive revascularization PCI procedure .</detailed_description>
