	<brief_summary>There increase evidence African country , include Burkina Faso , least settings/seasons proportion fever attributable malaria low low : mean current strategy treat fever case malaria advantage . Rapid , antigenic test might help , particularly peripheral health centre `` Centres de Santé et Promotion Sociale '' ( CSPS ) lack laboratory facility . Nevertheless two major problem could arise : - False negative : negative result would change decision treat , versus current `` presumptive '' strategy , false negative would treat malaria . - False positive : would expose risk leave without treatment true cause fever instead . The main purpose study assess short term outcome febrile patient treat test Rapid Diagnostic Test Paracheck® least equivalent ( inferior ) control ( presumptively treat without test ) term clearance fever major symptom sign . To , febrile patient randomly assign submit test clinical decision , manage usual way test . A follow carry Day 4th order determine proportion patient group persistence fever main clinical symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary outcome : proportion case ( fever patient randomise submit rapid test treatment ) control ( fever patient randomise submit rapid test ) persist fever follow-up . Secondary outcome : - proportion case ( fever patient randomise submit rapid test treatment ) control ( fever patient randomise submit rapid test ) persisting/new major clinical symptoms/signs and/or clinical complication follow-up ; - proportion case control refer hospital ; - prevalence malaria infection among febrile febrile patient ; - attributable fraction ( AF ) fever episodes malaria infection ( establish subsequent microscopic examination blood slide determination parasitemia level ) ; - optimal cut-off level parasitemia ( treatment threshold ) order define case malaria disease vs. simple malaria infection ( i.e. , presence malaria parasites blood presumably cause fever ) ; - performance Paracheck® ( sensitivity , specificity predictive value ) malaria disease field , compare expert reading ; - proportion case control malaria disease treat antimalarials/have treat presumed cause fever ; - proportion case control without malaria disease treat antimalarials/ treat presumed cause fever ; - proportion case control receive treatment , enrolment and/or follow . Cost - effectiveness model take account cost involve diagnosis treatment malaria condition . Sample size . Sample size determine main clinical outcome study , , fever clearance . Expected freq fever persistence day 4th : 40 % ; maximal accept difference 10 % ; power study 90 % ; alpha error 5 % : sample size 814 . We plan enrol least 500 subject fever per arm season , order account loss follow . Expected total enrolment : 4000 ( 1000 fever case 1000 patient without fever study period ) . Only fever patient randomise submit rapid test . Patients without fever consecutively enrol submit malaria slide clinical questionnaire , rapid test . Study start : 24th April 2006 . Second Phase : 2nd October 2006 . In study period end dry season end rainy season , three week study period , patient &gt; 6 month , present clinical consultation one 10 peripheral health centre participate study , respond inclusion criterion consent participate/with parental consent participate , enrol . All submit free charge thick film thin film malaria , brief questionnaire clinical history . All slide store reading . Those patient fever presentation ( axillary temperature &gt; = 37.5°C ) , randomise ( base computer-generated random number list ) either submit Paracheck® rapid test malaria ( case ) , manage usual way , , clinical ground alone ( control ) . Only Paracheck® result use decision malaria treatment case . Treatment control , treatment condition case control , solely depend judgment clinical officer . No formal algorithm follow national guideline . Sensitisation study sit information public carry start intervention .
