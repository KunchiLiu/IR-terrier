	<brief_summary>Small contract VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics present unique challenge implementation collaborative care distinct organizational characteristic lack on-site psychiatrist . A recent effectiveness study , successfully use telemedicine technology adapt collaborative care model small rural VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics . The purpose propose study implement telemedicine-based collaborative care model small Contract VA Community Based Outpatient Clinics determine sustainability cost-effectiveness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Implementing Telemedicine-Based Collaborative Care MDD Contract CBOCs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Objectives : Implementation collaborative care depression high priority Mental Health QUERI , prepare national rollout collaborative care key component VHA 's Mental Health Strategic Plan . In addition , Mental Health Task Force Report CARES Commission Report prioritize provision mental health service CBOCs . Secretary Principi repeatedly emphasize importance recommendation . However , small Contract CBOCs present unique challenge implementation collaborative care distinct organizational characteristic , long distance parent VAMCs , lack onsite psychiatrist . The Telemedicine Enhanced Antidepressant Management ( TEAM ) study , successfully use telemedicine technology adapt collaborative care model small CBOCs lack onsite psychiatrist . The purpose propose RIPPLE study implement evaluate telemedicine-based collaborative care model small Contract CBOCs . The goal aim RIPPLE study : Goal 1 To adapt apply implementation strategy develop TIDES/RETIDES order deliver telemedicine-based collaborative care service small contract CBOCs . Goal 2 : To evaluate implementation evidence-based best-practice respect clinical impact population patient MDD system care . The corresponding specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : Document evaluate process implementing , refining , sustain telemedicine-based collaborative care contract CBOCs . Specific Aim 2 : Estimate clinical impact telemedicine-based collaborative care implementation sit relative usual care control sit . Specific Aim 3 : Estimate system-level cost-effectiveness telemedicine-based collaborative care contract CBOCs . Research Design Study Setting : The study conduct 26 contract CBOCs VISN 16 VISN 22 . The analysis base pre-post quasi-experimental study design non-equivalent control group . The telemedicine-based collaborative care program implement 11 contract CBOCs without onsite psychiatrist cost/outcomes compare 15 similar control site . Data Collection Analysis : Data collect survey , key informant interview , VISTA , Austin Automation Center . Descriptive statistic use describe degree adoption ( i.e. , reach , effectiveness , adoption , implementation , maintenance ) . The clinical impact patient population estimate use random effect model individual patient unit analysis . The impact system estimate use Systems Cost Effectiveness Analysis . Significance : Evaluating strategy implement telemedicine-based collaborative care contract CBOCs high priority VA several reason . First , VA 's Mental Health Strategic Plan include plan rollout collaborative care throughout entire VA health care system . Second , importance provide mental health service CBOCs highlight recent introduction performance measure target mental health CBOCs . Third , 183 contract CBOCs VA health care system , on-site psychiatrist locate rural area far parent VAMCs . Fourth , TEAM collaborative care model demonstrate significantly substantially improve depression outcomes small rural CBOCs . While implementation collaborative care large VA-staffed clinic immensely challenge task , implement collaborative care small contract clinic even challenge . To prepare national rollout , imperative implementation strategy develop evaluate difficult setting order avoid creation two-tiered system care . National rollout strategy must target contract CBOCs ensure access collaborative care veteran prevent future health disparity . In addition , result RIPPLE study provide template development best-practice implementation strategy target high priority QUERI disorder contract CBOCs .</detailed_description>
