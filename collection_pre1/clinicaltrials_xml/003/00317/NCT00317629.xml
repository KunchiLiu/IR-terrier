	<brief_title>Controlled Nitric Oxide Releasing Patch Versus Meglumine Antimoniate Treatment Cutaneous Leishmaniasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Cutaneous Leishmaniasis ( CL ) worldwide disease endemic 88 country [ 1 ] . It estimate 1.5 million people suffer CL annually 350 million risk contract infection [ 2-4 ] . In America , 60,000 new case CL report annually [ 5 ] , endemic 20 22 country 2 island Caribbean [ 2 ] . Currently , CL affect 500 U.S. Army soldier serve Iraq [ 6 ] . In Andean region , incidence Leishmaniasis increase dramatically last two decade ; reach 14,000 case per year 1996-98 [ 7 ] . In Colombia 6,500 case report [ 8 ] . The increase report case CL Colombia related factor migration , deforestation , multiplication illicit plantation , arm political conflict behavioral change vector . The main strain Leishmania Colombia L. panamensis , L. brazilensis , L. infantum L. guyanensis , distribute throughout entire national territory , predominantly rural area [ 10 ] . CL cause intracellular protozoan parasite genus Leishmania [ 1 ] transmit human bite small percentage specie phlebotomus lutzomyia sandfly classify date [ 10 ] . In digestive system sandfly , dimorphic parasite present extracellular flagellate form call promastigote , upon release host blood , phagocytized macrophage , lose flagellum turn amastigote [ 12 ] . Dogs , rodents didelphidae natural host parasite man incidental host [ 11 ] . This zoonosis suffer interesting urbanization phenomenon , change eminent rural entity affect mainly men active age , disease affect people , especially child [ 8,9 ] . The characteristic lesion disease ulcer heal spontaneously period three month year , depend isolate , leave flat , atrophic depigmented scar [ 13-15 ] . The CL , especially one produce L. brazilensis evolve mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis ( MCL ) , bad prognosis owe deform character lesion [ 16 ] . The spontaneous cure lesion allow acquisition partial resistance reinfection , could explain high pathogenicity observe child young adult population [ 9 ] . Previous study show high incidence CL poor response treatment child population [ 17 ] . The program epidemiological vigilance Colombia require probable case CL ( identify ulcer feature patient 's origin ) confirm microscopic direct examination secession sample obtain ulcer , negative , biopsy wound . Once confirm , case must notify Local Health Secretary use clinical-epidemiological record . This institution , charge epidemiological vigilance , study source transmission distribute medication people affect . Currently , various aspect consider treat CL , among , risk develop MCL , grade , localization , number , size , evolution persistence lesion , important [ 18 ] . For 60 year , pentavalent antimony compound : sodium stibogluconate , ( Pentostan® , produce Glaxo-Wellcome ) meglumine antimoniate , ( Glucantime® , produce Sanofi-Aventis ) consider treatment choice disease [ 19 ] . Studies make Colombia report percentage cure 85 % , use meglumine antimoniate [ 20,21 ] . Despite fact efficacy drug high , present many disadvantage parenteral administration , , reversible secondary effect nausea , vomit , muscular abdominal pain , cardiac problem , rise concentration hepatic aminotransferase , chemical pancreatitis [ 21,22 ] . Additionally , adherence treatment affected duration ( several week ) availability restriction distribution . Therapeutic alternative second line propose ; amphotericin B pentamidine use excellent result , nevertheless high cost , little availability , necessity hospitalize patient administration severity secondary effect limit use [ 23,24 ] . In last decade new treatment CL develop , use oral agent mefloquine , itraconazole , miltefosine , paromomycin , ketoconazole , allopurinol dapsone , however , show enough evidence effectiveness [ 19,21,25,26 ] . In effort develop topical treatment CL , paromomycin use different preparation . However , rate curation achieve medication higher conventional treatment , even compare placebo [ 27,28 ] . In several study , vitro vivo , demonstrate nitric oxide ( NO ) effective eliminate various strain Leishmania amastigote form [ 29-35 ] . The production NO oxidation L-arginine cause inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) constitute one important defense mechanism macrophage [ 36 ] , two oxidative form defense Leishmania identify . During first phase infection , response phagocytosis process , promastigotes eliminate due release superoxide ion , process catalyze NADPH oxidase [ 29 ] . Those promastigotes survive defense mechanism evolve amastigotes , activate production IL-12 macrophage promote presentation antigen Leishmania [ 29 ] T helper 1 lymphocyte enhance cytotoxic activity macrophages toward intracellular parasite via interferon gamma ( INFγ ) tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFα ) promote production NO catalyze iNOS [ 31-33 ] . A recent study show high activity iNOS macrophages subject infect CL , suggest vital role NO immunological activity Leishmania [ 34 ] . In Studies rodent resistant Leishmania infection ( C57BL/6 ) , L. major , L. chagasi L. donovani inoculate , application iNOS inhibitor like NG-monomethyl-L-arginine ( L-NMMA ) cause high rate survival virulence parasite macrophage [ 33,35,37,38 ] . After inoculate L. major mouse genetic susceptibility develop infection Leishmania ( BALB/C ) , activity iNOS observe . However , application IL-12 , able control infection activate iNOS [ 31 ] . In human , several clinical trial realize topical treatment contain NO donor [ 39,40 ] . In Ecuador , group develop test NO generate topical cream S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine ( SNAP ) , evidence beneficial effect management type ulcer report serious adverse event . Nevertheless , due unstable nitric oxide release , cream apply frequently ( 4 time day ) make adherence treatment difficult [ 39 ] . In Syria , another group use potassium nitrate acidify salicylic acid ascorbic acid topical treatment L. tropica [ 40 ] . In vitro , NO generate mixture destroy amastigotes promastigotes Leishmania ; however , vivo , study 40 patient present inconsistent result , reduce size ulcer 28 % subject heal 12 % . The discrepancy result believe due technique use obtain NO . The acidification nitrite produce instant blast NO , release maintain long period time [ 40 ] . The difficulty control liberation NO create necessity look new technique regulate release . The nanofiber polymer produce electrospinning technique study order guarantee constant release pharmaceutical lesion . In electrospinning process , high voltage use create electrically charge jet polymer solution , dry solidifies leave behind dry polymer fiber [ 41 ] . As jet travel air , solvent evaporates leave behind charge fiber electrically deflect collect metal screen [ 42,43 ] . Fibers variety cross sectional shape size produce different polymer . With technique , encapsulation entrapment several pharmaceutical , enzymes protein successful . In previous study , nanofiber patch successfully use release vehicle tetracycline hydrochloride . The release tetracycline constant period 5 day [ 41 ; 43 ] . Using model , multilayer transdermal patch produce , nitrite bound ion exchange resin ( DOWEX ) electrospun polyurethane nanofibers layer . A solution contain Waterlock® superabsorbent polyurethane electrospun top nitrite-DOWEX layer . The ascorbic acid entrap polyurethane solution electrospun onto third layer , another layer Waterlock® superabsorbent polyurethane fourth final one . Upon hydration , Nitric Oxide Releasing Patch ( NOP ) produce stable release 3.5 µmol NO 12 hr [ 41,44,45 ] . In pilot study , develop Landazuri , Santander , Colombia , placebo-controlled clinical trial conduct 35 patient present 68 ulcer produce L. panamensis . Using NOP , 65 % improvement observe treated ulcer , 25 % improvement placebo group ( p=0.001 ) . In pilot study unique adverse event describe pruritus area patch apply ( unpublished data ) . Taking account wide distribution CL , change form transmission difficulty related availability medication , study proposes investigate whether NO donor transdermal patch , produce electrospinning , least , effective meglumine antimoniate treatment CL , less adverse event low cost , constitute therefore effective therapeutic alternative . In case effectiveness NOP demonstrate study , novel safe therapeutic alternative easy access high adherence one important public health problem country make available . OBJECTIVES General Objective To evaluate effectiveness safety NOP treatment CL compare meglumine antimoniate ( Glucantime® ) . Specific objectives 1 . To evaluate heal rate CL ulcer use NOP compare plan treatment meglumine antimoniate recommend health ministry . 2 . To identify adverse event associate application NOP compare one produce treatment meglumine antimoniate . 3 . To identify compare recidivism may occur NOP meglumine antimoniate . 4 . To advance search therapeutic alternative CL Colombia .

Pancreatic amylase spectrophotometry Sampling Technique Direct Test CL A direct test perform confirm presence cell amastigotes dermis scrape [ 46,47 ] ; sample must , far possible , free blood , cellular detritus pu . If patient present several lesion , sample must take one short time evolution , big induration area and/or least purulent discharge . If lesion scab must remove improve quality sample . The sample take active edge bottom ulcer . When sample take active edge asepsis must realize alcohol 70 % hemostasis perform use first second finger make sure blood sample . A small incision 3mm length depth make scalpel active edge parallel edge ulcer . With sharp side scalpel , scrape do dermic wall incision obtain tissue . The extracted material extend two microscope slide . The sample dry room temperature , fix methanol stain Giemsa , Wright Field . Using immersion oil sample observe microscope 100X lens , presence amastigotes Leishmania assess structure verify ( nucleus , kinetoplast cell membrane ) . If sample take center lesion hemostatic technique must use , scab remove , bottom ulcer well clean use sharp side scalpel prevent presence cellular detritus and/or purulent material . This procedure must continue granuloma see bottom . With technique use process sample active edge presence amastigotes Leishmania verified . Technique sample culture The sample culture may obtain suction ulcer active edge extract fragment tissue macerate phosphate-buffered saline solution ( PBS ) antibiotic ( 1000 UI crystalline penicillin per cc ) , put culture medium . A tuberculin syringe thin needle ( 26G ) , contain 0.3 cc PBS solution antibiotic use suction technique . Previous asepsis ulcer alcohol 70 % , needle introduce dermis rotate movement small amount tissue macerate needle bevel minute , suction syringe . The sample deposit aseptic condition NNN culture medium incubate 26ºC 4 week [ 46,47 ] . Every week drop extract culture medium place two slide observe microscope . In case promastigotes find , culture reject negative [ 46 ] . The strain identify specie use monoclonal antibody develop Dr. Diane Mc Mahon Pratt [ 48,49 ] . Evaluation management adverse event During treatment follow-up visit , patient ask adverse event . Each adverse event classify physician serious non-serious ( Table 2 3 ) . A serious adverse event meet one follow criterion : 1 . Death 2 . Life-threatening ( i.e. , immediate risk death ) 3 . In-patient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization 4 . Persistent significant disability/incapacity The presence serious adverse event put patient 's life risk and/or require immediate medical surgical procedure call discontinuation treatment initiation pertinent medical management patient . The investigator notify Adverse Event Committee ( AEC ) FCV serious adverse event within 24 hour learn . A non serious adverse event classify follow : 1 . Mild : The patient aware symptom and/or sign , tolerable . They require medical intervention specific treatment . 2 . Moderate : Patients present trouble interfere daily activity . They require medical intervention specific treatment . 3 . Severe : The patient unable work attend daily activity . They require medical intervention specific treatment . The possible relationship adverse event test medication classify investigator basis his/her clinical judgment follow definition : 1 . Definitely related : Event fully explain administration test medication . 2 . Probably related : Event likely explain administration test medication rather medication patient 's clinical state . 3 . Possibly relate : Event may explain administration test medication medication patient 's clinical state . 4 . Not relate : Event likely explain patient 's clinical state medication , rather test one . All event report AEC , depend criterion , decide continuity withdrawal patient study therefore break code . Although project design minimize inherent risk , adverse event relate study medication carefully evaluate AEC cost generate required treatment cover study . Data analysis phase This phase last 6 month . After complete data entry CFR , result audit detected error evaluate corrected person charge .
