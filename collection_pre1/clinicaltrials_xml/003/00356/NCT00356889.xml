	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together erlotinib hydrochloride work treat patient metastatic unresectable biliary tumor . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Giving bevacizumab together erlotinib hydrochloride may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Metastatic Unresectable Biliary Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate objective response rate patient metastatic unresectable cholangiocarcinoma treat bevacizumab erlotinib hydrochloride . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate time progression patient . II . Evaluate overall progression-free survival patient . III . Evaluate adverse event associate regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 15 oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
