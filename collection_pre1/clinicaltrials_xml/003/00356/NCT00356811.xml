	<criteria>A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Signed informed consent . Only females ≥18 year age recruit : Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , woman function ovary current document tubal ligation hysterectomy , woman postmenopausal ) ; Childbearing potential ( i.e. , woman function ovary document impairment oviductal uterine function would cause sterility ) . This category include woman oligomenorrhoea ( severe ) , woman perimenopausal young woman begin menstruate . These subject must provide negative serum pregnancy test Screening agree one following : Complete abstinence intercourse 2 week prior administration first dose study medication 28 day final dose study medication ; Consistent correct use one follow acceptable method birth control : Male partner sterile prior female subject 's entry study sole sexual partner female subject . Implants levonorgestrel . Injectable progestogen . Any intrauterine device ( IUD ) document failure rate le 1 % per year . Oral contraceptive ( either combine progestogen ) . Barrier method , include diaphragm condom spermicide . Subjects must histologically confirm invasive breast cancer stage IVdisease ; • Where disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature lesion confirm cytology histology . Subjects whose disease ER+ and/or PR+ unknown status include study meet follow criterion : They symptomatic visceral disease require chemotherapy ( e.g. , patient liver lung metastasis ) . The disease consider Investigator progress rapidly lifethreatening . Subjects receive endocrine therapy longer benefit therapy . Documented amplification ErbB2 define FISH primary metastatic tumor tissue . Results FISH test local laboratory acceptable , however , tissue sample must still send Central laboratory result repeat used eligibility criterion . If taxane administer neoadjuvant adjuvant setting , progression must occur ≥12 month completion treatment . Measurable lesion ( ) accord RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) criteria [ Stephens , 2004 ; Therasse , 2000 ] . Radiotherapy prior initiation study medication allow limited area ( e.g. , palliative treatment painful bone metastasis ) , sole site disease . Subject must complete radiation treatment recover acute radiation treatmentrelated toxicity , particular bone marrow suppression . Bisphosphonate therapy bone metastasis allow however ; treatment must initiate prior first dose study medication . Prophylactic use bisphosphonates subject without bone disease , except treatment osteoporosis , permit . Subjects stable central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases ( stable least 3 month ) confirm computerized tomography ( CT ) /magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ) leptomeningeal involvement eligible take oral steroid enzymeinducing anticonvulsant . Subjects must cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram ( multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram perform inconclusive ) . Subjects know history uncontrolled symptomatic angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure eligible . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 . Considered Investigator life expectancy least 3 month . Able swallow retain oral medication . Subjects must new archived tumor tissue available analysis . Subjects must complete screen assessment outline protocol . Subject must adequate organ function define Table 1 . Table 1 Baseline Laboratory Values Adequate Organ Function SYSTEM LABORATORY VALUES Haematologic Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 × 10^9/L Haemoglobin ≥9 g/dL Platelets ≥100 × 10^9/L Hepatic Albumin ≥2.5 g/dL Serum bilirubin 1.25 x ULN AST ALT ≤3 × ULN without liver metastasis 5 × ULN document liver metastasis Renal Serum Creatinine1 ≤2.0 mg/dL OR Calculate Creatinine Clearance1 ≥40 mL/min 1 . Calculated Cockcroft Gault Method . ALT = alanine aminotransferase ; AST = aspartate aminotransferase A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Pregnant lactating female . Received prior chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy metastatic disease . Prior therapy ErbB1 and/or ErbB2 inhibitor . Concurrent anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy ) take study medication . Unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug and/or prior cancer treatment . Peripheral neuropathy grade 2 great . Malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . Subjects ulcerative colitis also exclude . History malignancy . However , subject diseasefree 5 year , subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation , serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety . Active uncontrolled infection . Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent . Known history uncontrolled symptomatic angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure . Concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial involve investigational agent . Used investigational drug within 30 day five halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose investigational treatment . The subject know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate lapatinib excipients related paclitaxel excipients .</criteria>
