	<brief_title>Effect Educational Intervention Cardiac Patients ' Participation Rate Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) major cause disability economic burden western society . Ample evidence exist suggest participation patient structure Cardiac Rehabilitation Programs ( CRPs ) beneficial term improve prognosis quality life . Despite inclusion cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) Medical Insurance Basket ( MIB ) treatment patient acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) , recently patient suffer congestive heart failure , small proportion ( 5 % -7.5 % ) patient take part CRPs Israel . Several factor identify barrier CRP Israel , two lack patient motivation participate CRPs stemming , part , lack awareness regard importance CR availability ; Lack motivation medical staff refer patient CR result unawareness importance CR availability across Israel , name . The present study accord recommendation , propose simple intervention design improve patient ' medical staff 's awareness importance CR participation . It expect CRP participation significantly increase 20-30 % follow educational intervention employ . This intervention provide basis implementation intervention increase CRP participation cardiac patient national level . In addition increase proportion CABG patient attend CRPs , study aim measure effect CRP participation subsequent 1-year health behavior relate outcome , 3-year mortality . We expect find difference outcome measure participate patient .</detailed_description>
