	<brief_summary>The purpose study see well three investigational drug work together prevent progression disease . This study provide new combination chemotherapy drug - docetaxel oxaliplatin - first line therapy treatment lung cancer . The therapy include bevacizumab may prevent slow blood supply tumor may also prevent tumor growth . The three investigational drug United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve .</brief_summary>
