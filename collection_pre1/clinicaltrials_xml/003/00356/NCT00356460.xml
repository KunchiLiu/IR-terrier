	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study GC1008 Treat Renal Cell Carcinoma Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transforming growth factor-beta ( TGFβ ) cytokine often over-expressed over-produced malignancy implicate important factor promote growth , progression , metastatic potential advance cancer . In preclinical study , TGFβ act promote tumor cell migration/invasiveness , influence tumor stroma ( increase extracellular matrix production , cytokine secretion , angiogenesis ) , suppress anti-tumor immunity . The purpose study investigate clinical use GC1008 , human monoclonal antibody capable bind neutralize isoforms TGFβ . This Phase 1 multi-center , open-label , dose-escalation study design characterize safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic , potential anti-tumor activity GC1008 , patient histologically confirm , locally advance surgically inoperable metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) malignant melanoma . Patients RCC must fail least 1 prior therapy patient renal cell carcinoma must fail either sorafenib sunitinib . Other qualify prior therapy include medical , surgical , radiation investigational approach use potential therapeutic benefit ( diagnostic purpose ) patient advanced disease . Patients may receive 4 intravenous infusion GC1008 , patient stable disease , objective tumor response clinical benefit may eligible receive extend therapy . For part 2 study , patient malignant melanoma enrol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In Part 1 , Dose Escalation : Patients histologically confirm , locally advance &amp; surgically inoperable metastatic renal cell carcinoma malignant melanoma eligible . In Part 2 , Patient Expansion : Patients histologically confirm , locally advance surgically inoperable metastatic malignant melanoma eligible . In part 1 2 : All patient must fail ≥ 1 prior therapy potential patient may eligible curative intent treatment ( e.g. , potentially curative surgical resection chemotherapy ) . Other qualify therapy include medical , surgical , radiation , investigational approach use potential therapeutic benefit ( diagnostic purpose ) patient advance disease.In addition , In Part 1 , Patients renal cell carcinoma must fail temsirolimus either sorafenib sunitinib part prior therapy . Expected survival ≥5 month Eastern cooperative oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 2 . Measurable disease define RECIST Laboratory : a. Serum albumin &gt; = 3.0 g/dL . b . Marrow : Hemoglobin &gt; =10.0 g/dL , absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1,500/mm3 , platelet &gt; = 100,000/mm3 . c. Hepatic : Serum total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( Patients Gilbert 's Disease may include total bilirubin &lt; = 3.0 mg/dL . ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; = 2.5 x ULN . If patient know liver metastasis , ALT and/or AST &lt; =5 x ULN allow . d. Renal : If negative proteinuria urine dipstick , serum creatinine ( sCr ) &lt; 2 mg/dL urine creatinine clearance &gt; = 60 mL/min . If urine 1+ positive ( 30 mg/dL ) , urine protein must &lt; =1 g/24 hour measure creatinine clearance &gt; = 60 mL/min . e. Prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) within normal range . f. Negative test ( antibody and/or antigen ) hepatitis virus B C HIV At time enrollment , patient must &gt; 4 wks since major surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy ( &gt; =6 wks treat nitrosourea , mitomycin , monoclonal antibody bevacizumab ) , immunotherapy , biotherapy/targeted therapy recover toxicity prior treatment &lt; = Grade 1 , exclusive alopecia . Concurrent cancer therapy permit . ( In patient receive long act agent , treatmentfree interval 2 halflives consider . ) Patients must able give write informed consent participate . Patients may consent durable power attorney . Male female patient childproducing potential must agree use effective contraception enrol study receive experimental drug , least 3 month last treatment . Female patient childproducing potential must negative serum pregnancy test confirm within 7 day receive initial dose GC1008 therapy . Documentation flu vaccination enrol flu season ( defined availability vaccine ) . Otherwise , patient receive current flu vaccine &gt; = 1 wk begin GC1008 therapy . Pretreatment tumor sample , paraffin block unstained slide , must available analysis . Central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases , meningeal carcinomatosis , malignant seizure , disease either cause threatens neurologic compromise ( e.g. , unstable vertebral metastasis ) . History ascites pleural effusion , unless successfully treat , completely resolve , patient treat condition &gt; 4 month . Active thrombophlebitis , thromboembolism , hypercoagulability state , bleeding , use anticoagulation therapy ( include antiplatelet agent ) . Patients history deep venous thrombosis may participate successfully treat , completely resolve , treatment give &gt; 4 month . Hypercalcemia : Calcium &gt; 11.0 mg/dL ( 2.75 mmol/L ) unresponsive uncontrolled response standard therapy ( e.g. , bisphosphonates ) .

Patients diagnose another malignancy unless follow curative intent therapy , patient disease free least 5 yrs probability recurrence prior malignancy &lt; 5 % . Patients curatively treat early stage squamous cell carcinoma skin , basal cell carcinoma skin , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) eligible study . Patients organ transplant , include receive allogeneic bone marrow transplant . Use investigational agent within 4 wks prior study enrollment ( within 6 wks treatment longacting agent monoclonal antibody ) . Patients immunosuppressive therapy include : . Systemic corticosteroid therapy reason , include replacement therapy hypoadrenalism , pAtients receive inhaled topical corticosteroid may participate . b .
