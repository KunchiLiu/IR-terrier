	<brief_summary>Preterm infant born immature lung often require help breathing shortly birth . This currently involve administer 100 % oxygen . Unfortunately , delivery high oxygen concentration lead production free radical injure many organ system . Term near-term newborn deprive oxygen prior birth respond well good resuscitation room air ( 21 % oxygen ) compare 100 % oxygen . However , static concentration 21 % oxygen may inappropriate preterm infant lung disease . Our study investigate adjusting amount oxygen give sick preterm newborn affect ability maintain safe oxygen level blood . Each infant assign receive one three treatment birth . Resuscitation either start 21 % oxygen increase need , 100 % oxygen decrease need 100 % oxygen change make ( current standard treatment ) . The first two group adjustment oxygen concentration need reach safe target range blood oxygen saturation . We anticipate preterm newborn infant resuscitate high oxygen concentration higher `` normal '' level oxygen blood resuscitate initially low concentration oxygen likely `` normal '' oxygen level blood . All premature infant surface probe place right hand measure saturation blood oxygen . Following resuscitation , treatment proceed per standard care hospital discharge . All infant admit neonatal intensive care unit give prematurity . The purpose study investigate safely restrict amount oxygen deliver newborns resuscitation affect amount oxygen blood . Hypothesis : In randomize control trial , infant resuscitate `` low oxygen delivery ( LOD ) '' strategy ( initiation resuscitation 21 % O2 ) remain normoxemic great proportion time resuscitation infant resuscitate `` high oxygen delivery ( HOD ) '' strategy ( 100 % O2 use entire resuscitation ) normoxemic small proportion time resuscitation .</brief_summary>
