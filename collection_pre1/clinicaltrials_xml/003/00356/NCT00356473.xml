	<brief_title>Effects Atorvastatin Disease Activity HDL Cholesterol Function Patients With Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart attack lead cause death patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Cardiovascular event occur frequently would expect patient RA traditional heart risk factor explain increase risk . Further research need pursue way reduce heart disease mortality improve outcome patient RA . There reason believe class cholesterol-lowering medication call statin , beneficial cardiovascular disease prevention , may able reduce irritation joint ( `` inflammation '' ) associate RA . Statins show reduce manifestation inflammation blood patient increase risk heart disease , process reduce risk heart attack , stroke , sudden death . Some similarity nature RA heart disease may suggest potential benefit statin therapy condition . In addition inflammation , another factor may contribute coronary heart disease ( CHD ) risk RA patient dysfunctional high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C , sometimes refer `` good cholesterol '' ) . Normally , HDL-C act counter type damage call `` oxidation '' within LDL-C critical step development progression heart disease . Data patient RA system lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) suggest patient active rheumatic disease RA SLE may increase amount dysfunctional HDL-C , therefore may increase risk heart disease . A blood test develop Dr. Navab colleague UCLA rapidly assess HDL-C function . This study investigate level HDL-C antioxidant function patient active RA well whether abnormal HDL function improve statin use population . This research also evaluate effect atorvastatin arthritis activity . We hypothesize atorvastatin may improve joint inflammation anti-inflammatory property HDL cholesterol .</detailed_description>
