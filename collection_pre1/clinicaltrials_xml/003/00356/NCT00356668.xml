	<detailed_description>In face exogenous surfactant use antenatal steroid , respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) remain leading cause morbidity mortality premature infant . RDS result series complex , interrelated event , include atelectasis , ventilation-perfusion mismatching , lung inflammation/injury ( 1 ) . The cascade event typifies RDS long-term counterpart , chronic lung disease ( CLD ) , root intrinsic deficit premature lung well exacerbated mechanical ventilation , mainstay therapy . For reason , scientist clinicians alike continue search treatment modality treat RDS also decrease incidence chronic lung disease . The use non-invasive ventilatory strategy , nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( NCPAP ) , treatment RDS think provide positive distending pressure minimize lung inflammation injury associate mechanical ventilation ( 2 ) . Avoidance intubation increase use NCPAP treat respiratory distress syndrome show decrease incidence chronic lung disease ( 3,4 ) . However , NCPAP common clinical limitation . First , administration NCPAP inherent mechanical difficulty appropriately maintain nasal prong apparatus within small neonatal nose . Secondly , nasal prong use deliver NCPAP cause nasal septal trauma . Lastly , premature infant tolerate NCPAP apparatus must tightly affix nose face . This intolerance often demonstrate increased patient movement , subsequently , risk mechanical difficulty septal trauma increase time . Although NCPAP continue use neonatal intensive care unit ( NICUs ) , due aforementioned drawback , continue look effective , non-invasive mode ventilation provide support premature infant respiratory distress . Humidified high flow nasal cannula ( HFNC ) recently introduce neonatal respiratory care mean provide positive distending pressure neonate respiratory distress . HFNC aim maximize patient tolerance employ heat , humidify gas flow standard neonatal nasal cannula use routinely neonatal intensive care unit . HFNC provide positive distending pressure use high gas flow ( &gt; 1 liter per minute ) ( 5 ) . Although numerous neonatal intensive care unit use HFNC , include NICUs Children 's Hospitals Minnesota , study regard use population . Anecdotally , premature baby tolerate administration HFNC quite well . However , like new therapy , many unknown . There one study date investigates HFNC versus NCPAP preterm neonate ( 6 ) . Sreenan colleague find HFNC effective NCPAP management apnea prematurity also demonstrate positive distending pressure provide HFNC vary patient 's weight . Sreenan 's study well preliminary data present abstract form cite HFNC use various amount gas flow , range 1 liter per minute 6 liter per minute ( 6,7,8 ) . The choice much gas flow use HFNC system unclear . This decision actually three-fold question : 1 ) initial amount liter flow use , 2 ) particular liter flow provide positive distending pressure patient , 3 ) value system-specific ? We aim evaluate question study . Until recently , NCPAP mainstay non-invasive ventilatory support premature baby . However , HFNC well tolerate us nasal cannula less prone mechanical mishap NCPAP , clear need information accurately treat baby HFNC . The result study help guide use HFNC preterm baby respiratory insufficiency , knowledge positive distending pressure derive HFNC system crucial minimize barotrauma fragile , premature lung .</detailed_description>
