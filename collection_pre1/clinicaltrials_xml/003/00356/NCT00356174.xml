	<brief_title>An Observational Study Childhood Food Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This observational study investigate developmental immunology peanut , egg , milk allergy cohort milk- egg-allergic child risk peanut allergy . This strategy help delineate , compare , contrast biological marker immunologic change associate development peanut allergy loss egg milk allergy , simultaneously evaluate important clinical environmental influence likely account recent rise prevalence allergy . The hallmark food-allergic disease production food-specific Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) antibodies represent end result T helper 2 ( Th2 ) influence immune response . Currently , limit understanding mechanism involve developmental course food allergy . To effectively prevent reverse progression food allergy , immune intervention need . Furthermore , likely successful strategy need direct person identifiable risk ( e.g. , biomarkers associate development peanut allergy ) .</detailed_description>
