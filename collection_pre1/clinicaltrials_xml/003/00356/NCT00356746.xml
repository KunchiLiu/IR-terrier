	<brief_title>Inflammatory Response During Anesthesia Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo major surgical procedure , particular undergoing cardiac surgery , develop severe inflammatory response 50 % case lead increased mortality morbidity . The inflammatory response depend surgical procedure patient related factor like genetic predisposition co morbidity . However , vitro study show type duration general anaesthesia also influence extent perioperative inflammation . Comparison : total intravenous anesthesia propofol compare volatile anesthesia isoflurane respect development perioperative inflammatory response . The IRAS study single centre study , execute University Medical Centre Utrecht , The Netherlands . Four different patient group include . 1 ) Patients undergo coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) use cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , 2 ) patient undergo aorta aneurysm repair via endovascular approach 3 ) via conventional open procedure , 4 ) patient undergo surgery replacement implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) . The IRAS prospective , randomized clinical trial . Patients randomly assign intravenous balanced anaesthesia technique . Peripheral blood sample draw , 72h surgery .</detailed_description>
