	<brief_title>TNF-Bound Colloidal Gold Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose TNF-bound colloidal gold ( CYT-6091 ) patient advance solid tumor . - Determine toxicity CYT-6091 patient . Secondary - Determine pharmacokinetics CYT-6091 patient . - Evaluate biopsy sample tumor adjoin normal tissue level CYT-6091 . - Determine antitumor effect CYT-6091 occur patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , sequential cohort , dose-escalation study . Patients receive TNF-bound colloidal gold ( CYT-6091 ) IV day 1 15 ( course 1 ) . Approximately 4-6 week later , patient re-staged respond patient may receive another course therapy . Patients may receive 3 re-treatment course . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos CYT-6091 maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 1 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Blood sample collect baseline periodically first course therapy pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 4 month next year , every 6 month thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
