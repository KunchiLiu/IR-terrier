	<brief_title>Fluphenazine Decanoate Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis hyperproliferative , inflammatory , immune-mediated skin disease affect approximately 2 % United States European population ( Tutrone 2001 , Kipnis 2005 ) . This disease manifest red , scaly plaque itchy and/or painful . Patients psoriasis may socially stigmatize appearance . Currently , cure condition . Often , repeat medical treatment necessary become expensive . Treatment topical corticosteroid mainstay therapy mild moderate psoriasis . In severe case , systemic therapy ( e.g. , cyclosporine ) phototherapy ( e.g. , ultraviolet B ( UVB ) irradiation ) use . These treatment , however , associated toxicity inconvenience . There anecdotal evidence suggest antipsychotic drug beneficial effect psoriasis ( Gupta 2001 , 2003 ) . Fluphenazine phenothiazine antipsychotic drug . In vitro , fluphenazine kill activate human T cell condition affect rest T cell ( Immune Control Inc. data show ) . To determine size therapeutic window human peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) , Immune Control Inc. perform follow experiment . First , phytohemagglutinin- ( PHA ) -activated cell expose 2 , 10 , 20 µM fluphenazine 0 , 18 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 72 hour . Second , rest cell expose identical fluphenazine concentration identical time period , drug wash cell , cell activate PHA . In case , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) synthesis measure expose cell tritiated thymidine , measure incorporate nucleotide scintillation counting . The data show exposure activate cell 10 µM fluphenazine 72 hour , 20 µM fluphenazine 36 hour , cause death virtually activate cell . The ability rest cell initiate DNA synthesis activation , contrast , largely unaffected fluphenazine exposure . Although precisely control intralesional fluphenazine concentration , expect injection 1 mg fluphenazine decanoate yield local concentration exceed 10 µM without significant systemic fluphenazine concentration . We propose fluphenazine suppress proliferate T-lymphocytes psoriatic plaque vivo thus result heal plaque . The objective study ass safety biologic activity intralesional injection fluphenazine decanoate adult subject psoriasis .</detailed_description>
