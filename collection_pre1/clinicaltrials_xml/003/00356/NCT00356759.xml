	<brief_summary>Patients mechanical heart valve prosthesis irregular beat ( atrial fibrillation ) high risk blood clot formation . Such clot result stroke . The patient treat warfarin - `` blood thinner '' - prevent complication . The treatment monitor blood test call Prothrombin time ( PT ) every 1-4 week . The dose warfarin change whenever PT result outside treatment range . If result low increase risk blood clot . If , instead , result high risk bleeding . One third patient stable PT result hardly ever change dose . The investigator hypothesis patient go less often , e.g . every 12 week , blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The PRolongation INTerval prothrombin time test stable patient ( PRINT ) single center , randomize , double-blind study demonstrate test prothrombin time every 12 week provide level anticoagulant control conventional test every 4 week subset stable patient . This study enroll patient treat vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) least 6 month change maintenance dose recent 6 month . HYPOTHESIS : Our hypothesis extend interval test 12 week stable patient , level anticoagulant control , maintain . With large constantly increase number patient warfarin , reduced frequency test would yield considerable saving health care system decrease burden patient . A review anticoagulant clinic reveal one third patient would eligible prolongation test interval . STUDY DESIGN : The proposal randomize , double-blind , control single centre trial perform Hamilton Health Sciences - General Hospital . Main inclusion criterion : long-term anticoagulant therapy , manage clinic least 6 month unchanged maintenance dose least 6 month . Eligible consent patient identify annual review visit register patient monitor clinic , randomized dosing warfarin every 4 week ( control ) every 12 week ( experimental ) . All patient , however , blood drawn every 4 week . Randomization perform use computer-generated randomization sequence . Stratification do two laboratory perform analysis two therapeutic range patient maintain within , depend indication anticoagulation . Patients mechanical mitral valve prosthesis maintain 2.5 3.5 , others 2.0 3.0.The randomization sequence guide Coordinating Methods Center correct report procedure patient , provide sham INR-values two set three 4-weekly test patient allocate 12-weekly monitoring . Extreme INR result ( &lt; 1.5 &gt; 4.4 ) always report true result . The investigator patient blind procedure aware sequence order number.The patient carefully instruct risk factor change effect VKA . They contact telephone test information result , dose question adverse event . After 12 month study final visit schedule anticoagulation clinic review patient . ANALYSIS : After last patient conclude study , clinical data transfer study statistician analysis . The primary outcome measure `` time therapeutic range '' ( TTR ) . The secondary outcome measure `` proportion patient extreme INR result '' , `` proportion INR result extreme '' `` number change maintenance dose '' . These well-recognized tool evaluation level anticoagulant control . Major bleed objectively verify thromboembolic event also register , expect number small sufficient statistical analysis . SAMPLE SIZE : Sample size calculation base 77 % TTR population stable VKA-dose maximum tolerable deviation 7.5 percentage point ; one-sided alpha 2.5 % power 90 % . The sample accordingly 107 patient per group . After interim analysis DSMB recommend expand sample size 125 patient per group ( July 16 , 2008 ) .</detailed_description>
