	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn patient early stage kidney disease high blood pressure . We know body produce natural substance cause blood vessel open wider carry blood need . An example exercise . Other natural substance cause blood vessel get small slow blood flow need . An example people cold . The balance substance important . People kidney disease high blood pressure normal balance substance . This study include 3 group people , people normal blood pressure , people high blood pressure people kidney disease . - Subjects screen physical examination , include ECG laboratory test - Subjects high blood pressure may take regular blood pressure medication 3 week prior inpatient GCRC study - Subjects give intra-arterial medication cause change blood vessel in-patient study . The study compare response three group . A GFR test do confirm renal function group chronic kidney disease . These study provide insight mechanism pathogenesis enhance α1 vasoreactivity subject progressive renal disease . This lay groundwork new strategy treatment prevention vascular disease among rapidly grow group individual CKD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alpha-Adrenoceptor Vascular Function In Chronic Kidney Disease Focus On The Role Of Endothelial Nitric Oxide</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enhanced adrenergic vascular reactivity may significantly contribute hypertension excessive cardiovascular disease burden patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Nitric oxide ( NO ) , modulator neurovascular function , may link adrenergic vascular responsiveness . The central HYPOTHESIS reduction endothelial nitric oxide ( NO ) bioavailability contribute enhancement α1-adrenoceptor vasomotor function patient CKD . Specific Aims : In patient mild moderate CKD , compare match hypertensive normotensive control without CKD : 1 . Determine α1-adrenoceptor vasoreactivity enhance less inhibition endothelial NO 2 . Determine whether α1-adrenoceptor vasoreactivity correlate plasma level endogenous NO inhibitor , asymmetrical dimethylarginine . Methods : CKD confirm I125-iothalamate glomerular filtration rate . Regional α1-adrenoceptor vasoreactivity ( sensitivity [ EC50 ] , reactivity [ slope ] ) assess venous plethsymography use grade intra-arterial infusion α1-adrenoceptor agonist , phenylephrine . Comparisons vasoreactivity baseline infusion L-NMMA make hypertensive non-diabetic subject glomerular filtration rate 30-70 ml/min age- , gender- , ethnicity- % body fat-matched hypertensive normotensive subject normal kidney function . In addition , plasma level endogenous NO inhibitor , asymmetric dimethylarginine measure hypertensive subject without CKD compare vasoreactivity . Significance . These study provide insight mechanism pathogenesis enhance α1 vasoreactivity subject progressive renal disease .</detailed_description>
