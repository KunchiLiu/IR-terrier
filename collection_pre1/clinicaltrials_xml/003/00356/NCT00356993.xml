	<brief_title>Phase I Study : Stop Smoking Therapy Ontario Patients ( STOP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According US Surgeon General 's Report ( 1988 ) , immediate , intermediate long-term benefit health quit smoking . For example , 50 % reduction coronary heart disease risk 12 month risk stroke reduced nonsmoker 5-15 year quit . ( US Surgeon General 's Report , 1990 , p.vi ) . In systematic assessment value clinical preventive service recommend US Preventive Services Task Force , smoke cessation treatment adult one highest-ranked service term cost effectiveness potential reduce burden disease . Most smoking cessation intervention cost less per year life save widely accept medical practice . For example , cost-effectiveness analysis implementation Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) guideline show cost $ 4,113 per life-year saved , 2001 price compare annual mammography woman age 40 49 year , cost $ 71,751 2001 price , hypertension screen men age 40 year , cost $ 27,117 2001 price . Therefore , smoke cessation service refer `` gold standard '' compare cost effectiveness healthcare intervention . Although study show high cost increase healthcare utilization first year quit smoking due illness ( Martinson , 2003 ) , study demonstrate smoker quit eventually significantly low healthcare utilization continue smoker ( Fishman , 2003 ; Warner , 2003 ) Thus , healthcare organization Ontario Health Insurance Plan , implement smoke cessation service likely result relatively quick return investment . Both intensity duration behavioural intervention associate sustained remission smoking . The addition pharmacotherapy double odds quit successfully . However , many smoker face barrier access pharmacotherapy . The provision free pharmacotherapy potential help substantial number smoker quit . A study Curry et al , 1998 , evaluate smoker willing sign cessation-support program various degree coverage either program nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) . 10 % Smokers full coverage likely attempt quit oppose 2.5 % partial coverage . Therefore , USHHS guideline call coverage medication . Research show coverage tobacco dependence treatment enhance rate quit attempt also long-term abstinence smoker ( Levy &amp; Friend , 2002 ; Schauffler , McMenamin , Olson , Boyce-Smith , Rideout , &amp; Kamil , 2001 ) . On average , odds ratio quit one year 1.6 give free NRT . Therefore , insurer , public private , reimburse patient stop smoking medication . However , study Boyle et al 2002 , find simply include medication insurance plan increase quit rate utilization medication . Adequate precaution must take ensure free pharmacotherapy distribute conjunction behavioural intervention successful use smoker likely benefit pharmacotherapy.Pharmacotherapy expensive provide smoker . However , smoker want quit require medication quit ( McDonald , 2003 ) . Most smoker use 2-3 week pharmacotherapy combine behavioural intervention ( Pierce , 2002 ) . About 0.05 % smoker look quit seek specialize care . Moreover , assume 70 % current tobacco user ( Approximately 1.6 million ) Ontario try quit give year 10 % ( i.e . 169,000 ) individual would qualify seek reimbursement 10 week therapy $ 30/week , total estimate cost $ 50 million ! This clearly fundable therefore comprehensive strategy combine rational use pharmacotherapy necessary.Hypothesis : The provision free NRT increase long-term quit rate ( &gt; /= 6 month ) Ontario smoker .</detailed_description>
