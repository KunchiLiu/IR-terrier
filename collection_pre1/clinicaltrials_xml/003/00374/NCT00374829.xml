	<brief_summary>The study randomise control trial evaluate impact program use information technology ( IT ) healthcare professional support patient high blood pressure ( BP ) compare usual care . The program help patient monitor BP medication keep nurse , physician pharmacist inform respect patient confidentiality . The IT system link directly patient 's pharmacy data . Using pharmacy data response question compliance BP control , IT system provide appropriate counselling , telephone reminder , generates prescription refill renewal reminder call monitor BP . The system report compliance self record BP measurement healthcare provider also link nurse . This nurse , patient 's doctor pharmacist help answer question medication control high blood pressure . A total 500 patient Laval , Quebec participate study . Half patient program plus usual care usual care . We hypothesize program improve BP control help patient take medication properly help doctor ensure best strength kind medication use control high blood pressure . We believe program achieve help improve communication patient healthcare provider , without adversely impact quality life . Additional sub-studies determine program cost effective applied real practice program help patient , doctor , pharmacist nurse communicate well .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact IT-Based Healthcare Professional Support Program Patients With High Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As Canadian population age , number hypertensive patient major cardiovascular event increase , place additional burden healthcare resource . The positive effect optimal blood pressure ( BP ) control morbidity mortality clearly establish . In spite , data suggest 13 % Canadian hypertensive patient adequately control . It believe much poor BP control attribute : patient non-compliance ; acceptance inadequate BP control clinician ; low BP goal ; fact difficult achieve adequate BP control monotherapy majority patient . There recognised need improve communication patient health care provider among healthcare professional develop new tool improve patient compliance . We develop information technology ( IT ) -based system empower patient responsible monitor blood pressure ( BP ) compliance facilitate communication healthcare provider . The IT-based system link actual pharmacy prescription refill renewal data . Using data well response question compliance BP control patient provide use telephone , system : offer patient counsel telephone reminder ; generate prescription refill renewal reminder call ; , monitor patient record BP . The system generate monthly report treat physician pharmacist compliance blood pressure control , believe help monitor modify therapy appropriate . The system also link patient nurse BP inadequately control and/or patient non-compliant , , turn , provide appropriate counselling refer patient physician pharmacist appropriate . The randomised control trial ( RCT ) , design determine multidisciplinary , information-technology support hypertension management program ( hereafter call `` intervention '' ) improve BP control . We hypothesise intervention achieve enhance compliance pharmacotherapy patient use high dos anti-hypertensive agent appropriate , without adversely impact quality life . Additional sub-studies conduct explore perception patient , family healthcare provider impact intervention process care explore link communication relationship skill ( CRS ) , compliance health-care outcome evaluate collaborative model inter-professional practice . The primary outcome measure evaluate impact intervention mean change 24-hour systolic diastolic BP level measure use ABPM . Secondary objective assess likely mechanism account result primary objective measuring : refill compliance BP lower regimen , number dosage and/or type medication change 12-month study period time interval prescription initiate change , number different anti-hypertensive agent use number nature intervention pharmacist , nurse physician . In addition average 24 hour nocturnal diastolic systolic blood pressure measurement use 24 hour continuous ABPM 12-month follow-up ; proportion subject achieve target BP accord Canadian recommendation ; subject 's health relate quality life baseline 12-months ; cost-effectiveness system third party payer 's perspective term $ per QALY ( derive EuroQoL ) $ per year life gain , model long term reduction event associate well blood pressure control ; subject 's acceptance refusal part IT-based reminder blood pressure monitoring system ; , physician 's subject 's perception impact system process care .</detailed_description>
