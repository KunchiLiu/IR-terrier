	<brief_summary>This new platform non-myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplantation improve survival harness immunologic potential donor T-cells induce maintain long-term remission patient hematologic malignancy without undue toxicity . This study involve first study human direct optimize graft v leukemia effect infuse activate T-cells healthy donor prophylactically , month recovery initial transplant . Investigators study whether activation donor cell prior infusion enhance patient 's ability `` seek destroy '' residual malignant cell also help immune system fight infection without increase immune reaction host .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Disease relate Parameters The following category patient High Risk Acute Myelogenous Leukemia , MDS , Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia first second complete remission , age le 70 year old , would offer traditional allogeneic stem cell transplant ineligible , unwilling undergo , Allo SCT , eligible study . High Risk AML CR1 define one following : Intermediate Poor risk cytogenetics presentation ; Extramedullary involvement ( CNS ) ; High WBC presentation ( &gt; 20,000 ) ; AML evolve Myelodysplasia , regardless cytogenetics M3 CR2 Patients residual myelodysplasia induction chemotherapy AML Patients require second course induction chemotherapy achieve remission status felt inherently high risk consider eligible study MDSPatients deem high risk MDS base IPSS &gt; 1.5 eligible study . Patients must less 5 % blast time study entry may receive induction chemotherapy prior transplant . High Risk Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia pts CR1 3.1.4 CR2 ( include AML , M3 ) patient : Patients AML ALL relapse receive salvage chemotherapy discretion primary physician meet criterion CR2 eligible Not candidate standard myeloablative conditioning allotransplantation . Patients typically ineligible standard allo SCT age great 50 , comorbid disease precludes myeloablative conditioning ( coronary artery disease cardiomyopathy , poor pulmonary function , medical disorder , opinion patient transplant physician , would result unacceptable toxicity standard myeloablative conditioning allogeneic transplantation ) . Patientrelated Parameters : Patients must healthy histocompatible donor ( A , B DR match ) ; either sibling unrelated volunteer identify NMDP Age 18 70 year old Life expectancy great 3 month . ECOG performance status 01 . Patients must acceptable organ function : total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 AST ALT &lt; 3 x normal , unless increase think either nonhepatic cause ( i.e hemolysis ) relate underlying disease ( liver involvement leukemia ) ; creatinine &lt; 2.0 creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min ( calculate collect ) ; Cardiac : An ejection fraction &gt; 40 % MUGA echocardiogram ; Pulmonary : correct DLCO &gt; 50 % Subjects : Patients may chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week prior enter study . Patients must recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients may uncontrolled untreated central nervous system involvement Patients may uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . HIV positive patient exclude The effect chemotherapy agent likely harmful develop human fetus . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Pregnant woman exclude study chemotherapy potentially teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother chemotherapy , patient breastfeed discontinue breastfeed exclude trial Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother chemotherapy , patient breastfeed discontinue breastfeed exclude trial Donors : Sibling donor evaluate accord standard practice University Pennsylvania Bone Marrow Stem Cell Transplant Program Unrelated donor evaluation consent perform NMDP donor center accord standard guideline procedure .</criteria>
