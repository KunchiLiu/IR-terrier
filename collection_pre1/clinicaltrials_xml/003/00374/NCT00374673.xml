	<brief_summary>Objectives : To investigate analgesic effect repeat session unilateral rTMS patient chronic pain syndrome due fibromyalgia , IBS burn mouth syndrome . Primary outcome numerical pain score . Methods : The study randomize perform parallel group double blind versus sham stimulation , include 90 patient ( 45 patient per treatment arm ) . The randomization computerize performed aetiological group separately . The rTMS perform left motor cortex , 5 consecutive day , week 3 week twice month 2 month , month 6 month . Clinical assessment include assessment pain , quality life , sleep , depression anxiety , catastrophizing , neuropsychological evaluation . Conclusion : study allow determine first time long term efficacy safety rTMS treatment dysfunctional idiopathic chronic pain syndrome often refractory conventional treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) Chronic Idiopathic Pain Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Several line evidence suggest fibromyalgia syndrome , Irritable Bowel syndrome ( IBS ) burn mouth syndrome chronic pain disorder affect pain modulation . Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) recent , safe non-invasive technique stimulate cerebral cortex , recently report induce short term analgesic effect patient chronic focal pain . We also recently show double blind randomize trial , rTMS could short term analgesic effect patient fibromyalgia . Objectives : Our aim investigate long term analgesic effect repeat session unilateral rTMS patient chronic pain syndrome due fibromyalgia , IBS burn mouth syndrome . Primary outcome numerical pain score brief pain inventory visit . Methods : This study randomize perform parallel group double blind versus sham stimulation . It include least 30 patient per pain disorder , ie 90 patient . Randomization computerize performed aetiological group separately ( ie , 3 distinct randomization procedure fibromyalgia , IBS stomatodynia ) ; . Stimulation apply right motor area correspond contralateral hand . The treatment consist first period 5 consecutive day stimulation , follow stimulation week 3 week stimulation twice month 2 month stimulation month 3 additional month . Clinical assessment perform baseline , day 1 , 5 , week 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 13 25 . It include depend visit assessment pain intensity characteristic , quality life , sleep , depression anxiety , catastrophizing , brief neuropsychological evaluation ( focus memory , attention vigilance ) . In patient fibromyalgia , evaluation also include specifically number tender point . In patient IBS , evaluation bowel dysfunction also perform . Conclusion : This study allow determine first time long term efficacy safety rTMS treatment dysfunctional idiopathic chronic pain syndrome often refractory conventional treatment .</detailed_description>
