	<brief_summary>This study determine experimental vaccine prevent Ebola virus infection safe side effect , , cause . Ebola virus infection may range mild severe , may cause breathe problem , severe bleeding , kidney problem shock lead death . The vaccine use study contain man-made genetic material similar one part Ebola virus , design stimulate immune response virus . The vaccine cause Ebola virus infection contain Ebola virus . Participants assign one three group enter study . Of first 16 people study , 12 receive lowest study dose vaccine 4 receive placebo ( inactive substance ) . If dose safe , next 16 people enter study , 12 receive high dose vaccine , remain 4 receive placebo . If dose safe , final 12 people last group 16 receive high study dose , 4 receive placebo . The vaccine give single injection arm day enrollment . Participants keep diary 5 day , record temperature , symptoms reaction injection site . They call study nurse day vaccination report feel , return clinic approximately six time follow-up evaluation . These visit may include check vital sign , physical examination , blood urine test , medical test need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : This Phase I , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded study examine safety , tolerability immune response recombinant Ebola adenovirus serotype 5 vector ( Ebola-rAd5 ) vaccine healthy adult . The hypothesis vaccine safe elicit immune response Ebola . The primary objective evaluate safety tolerability investigational vaccine VRC-EBOADV018-00-VP healthy subject . The secondary objective include immunogenicity evaluation adenovirus serotype 5 antibody titer ( Ad5 Ab ) Weeks 0 , 4 , 24 . Exploratory evaluation include immunogenicity evaluation Weeks 2 , 12 , 48 . Product Description : VRC-EBOADV018-00-VP recombinant product compose two replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 ( rAd5 ) vector encode glycoprotein ( GP ) , one Zaire strain one Sudan-Gulu strain Ebola . The final formulation buffer use diluent placebo control ( Crucell placebo ) . Injections administer intramuscularly ( IM ) needle syringe . Subjects : Healthy adult subject age 18 50 year old . Study Plan : Forty-eight subject receive 1 mL intramuscular ( IM ) deltoid injection , via needle syringe , study agent placebo deltoid muscle show schema . Dose escalation occur three week last injection precede dose group follow interim safety data review Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) , provide significant toxicity . No one subject per day enrol first 6 enrollment dosage group sixth subject enrol must 5 day ( Group 1 ) 14 day ( Group 2 Group 3 ) follow-up proceed enrollment group . Study Duration : Subjects evaluate 7 clinical visit 48 week study injection . Study Endpoints : The primary endpoint safety tolerability vaccine administer dose 2 x 10 ( 9 ) , 2 x 10 ( 10 ) 2 x 10 ( 11 ) virus particle ( VP ) IM injection . Secondary endpoint immunogenicity indicate Ebola-specific antibody cellular immune response Weeks 0 , 4 24 Ad5 antibody titer Weeks 0 , 4 , 24 . Exploratory analyse immunogenicity also conduct stored sample collect timepoints include Weeks 2 , 12 48 .</detailed_description>
