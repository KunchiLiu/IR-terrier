	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate long term outcome poly L-lactic acid / Î²-tricalcium phosphate ( BILOK ) biodegradable interference fixation screw used arthroscopic bone-patellar tendon-bone ACL reconstruction , determine BILOK screw completely biodegrade expect three year implantation , determine whether bone ingrowth defect remain resorption BILOK screw .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Long-term Degradation Outcome Bilok Screws Used ACL Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BILOK screw use ACL interference fixation US since late 1990s . As yet , long-term study demonstrate eventual biologic outcome device . Animal study indicate material use BILOK implant completely degrades 3 year , report indicate take place . Reports screw material indicate pure PLLA screw remain intact remove whole revision surgery first month year implantation . Recently report biopsy 2 year surgery indicate whole fragment PLLA screw observe . Schwach Vert suggest PDLLA screw ( combination dextro levo stereoisomers ) completely degrade replace bone 3 year surgery sheep information available human . In addition limited anecdotal , study evaluate degradation biodegradable screw use human conduct use plain radiograph MRI evaluate status biodegradable screw . A report Bach et al evaluate MRI appearance biodegradable interference screw composed different polymer ( polyglycolic acid 67 % trimethylene carbonate 33 % ) eight patient 2 year . It show reabsorption screw suggest MRI effective method determine bone ingrowth status area resorb screw . CT scan well methodology MRI application recently use study disappearance pure PLLA screw least 7 year implantation . The purpose study evaluate long-term resorption status Bilok screw determine , use CT scan , material replaces screw .</detailed_description>
