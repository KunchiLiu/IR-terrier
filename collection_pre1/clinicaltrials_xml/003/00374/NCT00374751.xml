	<brief_summary>Cancer cell may spread primary site vertebra result deformity . The standard treatment case removal cancer deposit vertebra fill induced cavity cement like substance . We study effect ( good bad ) add samarium ( radioactive substance ) cement inject induced cavity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Samarium Relief Pain Due Vertebral Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Protocol : 1 . Patients bone metastasis identify discussed weekly joint Neuroscience meeting hold Radiation Oncology Department . 2 . If patient eligible study , protocol offer him/her . If patient accepts ; inform consent obtain . 3 . The case schedule jointly Neurosurgeon Radiation Oncologist . 4 . Radiation physicist order radioactive samarium . During procedure : 1 . Neurosurgical procedure ( kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty ) perform standard use . mild general sedation local anesthesia . 2 . Once cavity identify fluoroscopy , trocar secure . The volume pressure kyphoplasty balloon record . 3 . According standard practice ; radiation team ( Radiation oncologist , Physicist ) handle radioactive material . All work do sterile condition . 4 . Two mCi . Samarium prepared serial dilution step radiation precaution department radiation oncology material transfer OR . 5 . 0.5ml `` Head Cement '' administer first act seal . 6 . The Samarium introduce vertebral cavity use 2-way valve Radiation Oncologist . Total 0.5ml ( Samarium+0.2ml radio opaque material ) 7 . The `` Foot cement '' ( 0.5 ml ) introduce via 2-way valve vertebral cavity neurosurgeon flush remain radioactivity system . 8 . The two way valve remove rest kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty ensue per ordinary protocol . 9 . Final volume cement inject record . 10 . After secure wound , device , syrinx , glove basin use handle radioactive substance collect `` red bag '' store radiation safety officer hot lab . till full radioactive decay . 11 . The room scan patient 's discharge , spillage report radiation safety officer normal procedure environmental protection ensue . Post Procedure : 1 . Normal neurosurgical recovery room protocol employ . No radiation precaution need . 2 . Patient discharge home . No delay radiation precaution 3 . Once patient clear , nuclear image scan obtain Gamma camera . The ratio uptake vertebra background calculate . Moreover , Full body scan obtain identify area uptake . 4 . A second nuclear imaging scan do 4th day procedure ( Two half Lives ) document significant decay calculate dose . 5 . MRI/CT scan area treat do 4 week assess outcome . 6 . Clinical follow obtain 2 , 4 week 3 month . Careful pain score assessment include time ( Use Study Flow Sheet )</detailed_description>
