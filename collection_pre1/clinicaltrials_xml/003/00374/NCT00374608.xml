	<detailed_description>In third degree , complete atrioventricular ( AV ) block , atrial electrical impulse fail conduct ventricle . Congenital complete AV block ( CCAVB ) incidence 1 15,000 1 25,000 live birth strong association maternal antibody . Patients isolate CCAVB range completely asymptomatic experience syncope , exercise intolerance congestive heart failure . A portion symptom attributable CCAVB secondary inability increase heart rate , hence cardiac output , response vary physiologic demand . For symptomatic patient , mainstay therapy cardiac pacing . Dual chamber pacing , atrial sense ventricular pacing , allow restoration physiologic heart rate response exercise increase metabolic demand . Resumption AV synchrony allow efficient ventricular filling . Overall , pace patient CCAVB would expect result improve cardiac function exercise tolerance . The traditional ventricular site pace patient CCAVB right ventricular apex ( RVA ) . This result interventricular dyssynchrony pace first stimulates right ventricle , rather typical midline ventricular activation pattern see patient intact AV node conduction . Mounting evidence show long term RV pace result morphologic change LV resultant compromise performance . Further study show chronic RV pacing diminishes exercise capacity patient heart failure well asymptomatic adult . There study , group particular , document ventricular change pace pediatric patient . No publish study examine possible deleterious effect RV pace exercise capacity child . We , therefore , propose detailed evaluation exercise performance , measure exercise duration , maximal heart rate , oxygen uptake ventilatory response , asymptomatic chronically RV pace child young adult . Specific Aim 1 : To describe effect dyssynchronous ventricular activation exercise performance child require long term RV pace Hypothesis 1 : Long term dyssynchronous electromechanical activation , secondary right ventricular apical pacing , deleterious effect exercise capacity asymptomatic pediatric patient . Specific Aim 2 : To correlate change exercise performance tissue Doppler indices mechanical dyssynchrony . Hypothesis 2 : Tissue Doppler sensitive mean evaluate dyssynchrony chronically pace patient . Background Significance The goal pacemaker therapy CCAVB restore , closely approximate , physiologic rate activation . Standard dual chamber pacing allow sinus node participation cardiac conduction . As result , physiologic chronotropic response exercise AV conduction could achieve . Indeed , prior study conclude dual chamber pace result increased exercise performance improve perception general well compare ventricular demand pace [ 1-3 ] . There , however , increase evidence long term RVA pace lead detrimental effect cardiac function secondary non-physiologic ventricular activation sequence . Animal study reveal regional leave ventricular change perfusion , function innervation chronically RVA pace subject well asymmetric hypertrophy LV wall [ 4,5 ] . Examinations patient inter/intraventricular dyssynchrony reveal loss coordination ventricular contraction relaxation . When RV initial site activation , portion LV prematurely activate result early segmental contraction low pressure dissipation energy resultant ejection , area activate later high stress effect paradoxical stretch earlier contract area [ 6 ] . These factor lead decreased efficiency diminish systolic function . Ventricular dyssynchrony impairs LV pressure generation , diastolic fill stroke volume , well , increase wall stress [ 7 ] . Tissue Doppler echocardiography recently proven valuable tool assess verify regional wall motion abnormality aberrant LV activation ability determine peak systolic velocity different myocardial region , degree myocardial deformation distinguish active systolic contraction passive displacement [ 8,6 ] . Recognizing less-than-optimal long term functional hemodynamic effect RVA pacing , prior investigator attempt utilize alternative RV pacing site variable success improve LV function [ 9,10 ] . Most evidence , however , indicate dyssynchrony result maladaptive ventricular remodel compromised function decrease exercise capacity [ 11,12 ] . Evaluation patient dilate cardiomyopathy conduction delay yield ample evidence deleterious effect dysscynchronous ventricular activation . Conversely , positive response restoration ventricular synchrony via bi-ventricular pacing highlight negative effect ventricular dyysynchrony . In subset patient , acute biventricular pacing , compare RV pacing , demonstrate increase systolic function ejection fraction , along decreased mitral insufficiency LV volumes [ 13 ] . Resynchronization positively influence reverse remodel significant reduction LV end systolic LV end diastolic volume leave atrial size - change appear permanent [ 7 ] . Resynchronization also implicate improved exercise capability , peak oxygen uptake improve quality life measure [ 14 ] . With establish evidence maladaptive change cardiac morphology function , plus emerge evidence adversely effect exercise capacity adult chronic RVA pacing , necessary investigate possible aberrancy exercise capacity RVA pace pediatric population .
