	<brief_summary>About 22 % Canadians high blood pressure , hypertension . However , study show 1 5 people hypertension blood pressure control . Diabetes also important risk factor heart disease stroke . About half people diabetes also hypertension - deadly combination . Studies show 1 10 people diabetes blood pressure control adequately - clearly something need do improve . Heart disease , stroke , hypertension , diabetes condition occur community , need explore innovative solution work community . Pharmacists well-placed community help identify people diabetes hypertension . This work well previous study patient high cholesterol level . Pharmacists nurse complementary skill , work team , may help identify good manage hypertension people diabetes . Our main objective test whether community pharmacist nurse team improve blood pressure control people diabetes hypertension .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) lead cause mortality Canada . Diabetes strong risk factor CVD , account 50 % -75 % death ( 1 ) . Almost half patient diabetes also hypertension . Recent evidence suggest blood pressure ( BP ) control important target blood glucose prevention complication diabetes , reduce BP reduces risk CVD renal dysfunction ( 2-4 ) . Despite , recommendation national guideline , BP control individual diabetes poor ( 5-10 ) . We recently perform systematic review 43 study , ( 72,237 patient ) , observe 40 % achieve treatment target ( 11 ) . This likely overestimate , study use BP target higher current recommendation . Community pharmacists advance nurse practitioner ( ANP ) well-positioned help identify follow-up patient diabetes hypertension . Objective : To determine efficacy community-based multidisciplinary screening intervention program blood pressure control patient diabetes . Design Methods : Design : Subjects randomize pharmacist/ANP intervention usual care . Inclusion criterion : Adult patient diabetes BP &gt; 130/80 mm Hg 2 consecutive visit 2 week apart . Exclusion criterion : patient institutionalize unlikely/unable comply follow visit . Procedures : Patients recruit via : 1 ) community pharmacy ( patient identify diabetes drug prescription ) , 2 ) referral via Capital Health Regional Diabetes Intake Program . Patients invite telephone attend in-pharmacy clinic . At Visit # 1 , ANP complete history physical exam ( include BP take use BPTruÂ® device , 6 reading perform 1 minute apart non-dominant arm , last 5 reading average ) ( 12 ) . The pharmacist review patient 's medication history . If average reading &gt; 130/80 mm Hg , patient invite attend 2nd clinic 2 week . If average BPs visit &gt; 130/80 mm Hg , patient approach consent participate randomize trial . Intervention group receive : BP wallet card discussion mean BP measure , CVD risk reduction counseling , hypertension education pamphlet , referral primary care physician assessment/management . The BP result fax along recommendation patient 's primary care physician . Written recommendations local opinion leader use reinforce late hypertension guideline . Follow-up : Patients follow 6 week ensure make appointment physician re-measure BP . BP measure 6-week interval ( Week 6 , 12 , 18 fax BP result recommendation primary care physician ) , final follow-up visit Week 24 . Usual care group receive : BP wallet card record BP measure , pamphlet diabetes , general diabetes advice give ANP usual care physician . Follow-up : No scheduled follow visit . One phone call patient occur 12 week inquire change BP management . A final follow-up visit occur week 24 re-evaluate BP offer patient intervention program . Evaluation : Outcome measure : The primary endpoint difference change systolic BP intervention usual care group 6 month . Secondary endpoint include : ( 1 ) change antihypertensive therapy ( new medication dosage increase ) , ( 2 ) % patient achieve BP target &lt; 130/80 mm Hg , ( 3 ) % patient use ACE inhibitor angiotensin receptor antagonist . Sample Size : A sample size 85 patient per group provide 90 % power ( assume standard deviation 20mmHg 2-sided alpha=0.05 ) detect 10mmHg difference primary endpoint . To account drop-outs , increase 110 patient per group . Analysis : Demographic characteristic summarize use percentage categorical variable median ( interquartile range ) continuous variable . To compare change BP intervention usual care , use 2-sample independent t-test . Significance Study : Treatment control hypertension people diabetes major public health problem , improve detection control hypertension major goal Canadian Hypertension Society . Novel way identification treatment guideline target patient population urgently need .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The following patient eligible study participation : Patients either type 1 type 2 diabetes .
