	<brief_summary>Weight gain link high consumption soft-drinks beverage sweeten high fructose corn syrup . Being overweight increase risk diabetes heart disease . These problem may due high blood glucose insulin response cause high fructose corn syrup . Sucromalt sweetener contain amount carbohydrate high fructose corn syrup , cause low glucose insulin response . The purpose study see consume soft-drinks food sweeten sucromalt instead high fructose corn syrup result low level blood glucose , insulin , cholesterol marker risk . We include study people overweight normally consume soft-drinks one likely benefit change .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Replacing HFCS With Sucromalt Subjects With Raised Waist Circumference</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diets high glycemic load ( GL ) associate increase risk diabetes cardiovascular disease , possibly association metabolic syndrome , dyslipidemia increase marker chronic inflammation . Since GL product glycemic index ( GI ) time amount carbohydrate diet , GL reduce either reduce GI reduce carbohydrate intake , effect maneuver health biomarkers may necessarily . A high consumption sugar regular soft drink associate increased weight gain adolescent , , adult , replace starch sucrose diet show result weight gain increase blood pressure certain inflammatory marker . However , latter study , effect sucrose sucrose-sweetened beverage food compare aspartame-sweetened beverage food . Since aspartame contain energy , sucrose control diet differ sucrose , also energy , fat protein ; energy le fat protein % energy sucrose control diet . This result problem interpretation result possible know dietary change responsible change biomarkers - indeed change due increase sucrose intake may offset opposite change , example , saturate fat intake . Another approach study effect reduce GL diet reduce GI diet without change amount energy , carbohydrate , fat protein . Such approach may scientifically desirable possible study effect change one dietary variable . Recently , development sucromalt allow replacement high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) food beverage nutritive carbohydrate sweetener reduce GI . Sucromalt enzymatically modify carbohydrate show elicits low glucose insulin response HFCS without apparent malabsorption . Therefore , purpose study conduct pilot study see exchange HFCS sucromalt effect glucose tolerance fast blood lipid inflammatory biomarkers subject high waist circumference .</detailed_description>
