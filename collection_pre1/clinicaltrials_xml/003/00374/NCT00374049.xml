	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effectiveness drug call Poly-ICLC , also know HiltonolTM , boost body 's immune system 's response experimental vaccine therapy ( call MUC-1 vaccine ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MUC1 Vaccine Conjunction With Poly-ICLC Patients With Recurrent and/or Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This one-arm clinical trial , evaluate 2 dos poly-ICLC reverse systemic immuno-suppression : 25 μg/kg 50 μg/kg . These dos administer I.M . three time week 2 week . Following 2 week treatment poly-ICLC alone , patient immunize subcutaneously 100-mer MUC-1 peptide + GM-CSF . Subjects boost twice two week interval , subsequently 3 month later , experience clinical benefit clinically stable disease . Poly-ICLC administer continually 3 time week I.M . first 2 week 2 time week I.M . thereafter . Subjects continue study evidence progressive disease . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy Poly-ICLC boost immunologic response MUC1 vaccine . Secondary objective evaluate ) change marker systemic immunosuppression ; b ) change dendritic cell number function ; c ) clinical response . Up 30 subject enrol single-site study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 year age old must histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate systemic disease potentially eligible . Patients early relapse must undergo fail definitive surgery and/or radiation . Patients either hormone naive , may concurrent hormone therapy LHRH analogue , may hormone refractory ( see section 3.1.4 full protocol ) Must evidence systemic immunosuppression evidence presence one following : 1 ) Low absent T cell zeta chain expression peripheral blood ( PB ) , 2 ) Low level cytokine production ( i.e. , IFNgamma , IL4 ) T cell PB , 3 ) Upregulation granulocyte activation marker ( CD 15 ) PB Availability least 2 PSA measurement 2 6 week , clearly document rise PSA . The minimum rise PSA must least 50 % baseline PSA . The last PSA value must &gt; 2 . Patients may hormonerefractory ( rise PSA , despite castrate testosterone level , i.e. , &lt; 50 ng/ml ) ; may metastatic disease ; maybe bisphosphonates . If patient antiandrogens ( Flutamide/Casodex ) , must agent least 28 day prior enrollment flutamide , least 42 day prior enrollment bicalutamide ( Casodex ) ) , without drop PSA . If hormone refractory , patient continue LHRH analogue . Signed write informed consent give patient enrollment study follow receipt verbal write information study . No concomitant therapy steroids No investigational therapy within 4 week enrol protocol No chemotherapy radiation therapy within 6 week enrol protocol . ECOG performance status 0 1 Patients must adequate organ marrow function Men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry duration study participation . Patients chemotherapy radiation therapy within 6 week study entry . No concurrent use investigational agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Presence active acute chronic infection , include urinary tract infection , HIV ( determine ELISA confirm Western Blot ) viral hepatitis ( determine HBsAg Hepatitis C serology ) . HIV patient exclude base immunosuppression may render unable respond vaccine ; patient chronic hepatitis exclude concern hepatitis could exacerbate injection . Patients either previously irradiate new CNS ( central nervous system ) metastases entry exclude . Preenrollment head CT require indicated clinical sign symptom . Patients history autoimmune disease , restrict , inflammatory bowel disease , systemic lupus erythematosus , ankylose spondylitis , scleroderma , multiple sclerosis . Subjects active prior malignancy within past 5 year ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ bladder ) .</criteria>
