	<detailed_description>Hemangioma infancy common tumor childhood occur 4 % 10 % infant . While hemangiomas benign behavior involute spontaneously , cause significant morbidity due location size . In addition , hemangioma may associate extracutaneous hemangioma result significant morbidity . Certain `` high risk '' hemangioma infancy , specifically multiple cutaneous hemangioma solitary large hemangioma , associate hepatic hemangiomatosis ; however , exact number size cutaneous lesion risk increase protocol evaluate patient remain controversial . The true prevalence hepatic hemangiomatosis unknown since large scale prospective study evaluate clinically asymptomatic patient cutaneous hemangiomas presence hepatic hemangiomatosis . One primary objective study determine incidence hepatic hemangiomatosis patient hemangiomas infancy compare hepatic ultrasound image result patient 1-4 cutaneous hemangioma , 5 cutaneous hemangioma , least 1 large hemangioma &gt; 30 cm2 versus image result patient without cutaneous hemangioma . The study also attempt identify specific risk factor associate development hepatic hemangiomatosis identify associate risk factor patient clinically symptomatic hepatic hemangiomatosis .</detailed_description>
