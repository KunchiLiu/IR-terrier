	<brief_summary>Vitamin A deficiency child associate increased mortality morbidity due respiratory tract diarrhoeal infection . Vitamin A supplementation show study reduce morbidity due respiratory disease . However , study reduce could document benefit vitamin A supplementation . The role vitamin A immunity humans yet clear due inconclusive result . To evaluate immune change compare know immunopotent agent like zinc , randomise double blind study carry 1-3 year age child without acute illness wt/age 61 % 70 % NCHS standard . Baseline anthropometry vitamin A status determine use MRDR test immune status estimate . Each group consist 50 child either receive vitamin A 200,000 IU 7 day 40 elemental zinc daily 7 day placebo . After 8 week immunity test repeat . Immunity test include serum 1gA , 1gM , 1gG lymphocyte simulation 8 antigen multiple skin test . Undiminished child give measles vaccine serum titre measure supplementation . Vitamin A status estimate MRDR test . Vitamin A2 give 1ml blood sample collect 5 hour see ratio vitamin A1 A2 ( &lt; 0.06 cut ) modify relative dose response ( MRDR test ) . Doses vitamin A zinc repeat completion 2 month . The result compare group within group baseline 6 week . The study generate information help examine immune response vitamin A therapy child underlie factor reduction mortality morbidity . The study complete within year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Immunological Effect Vitamin A Zinc Placebo Controlled 4 Cell Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immunological indicator monitor begin 8 week give vitamin A zinc double blind randomize trial . A clinical base study do see effect zinc vitamin A supplementation malnourish subject . Vitamin A status estimate use new indicator , modify relatively dose response . ( MRDR ) .Procedure : Study population : Children age 1 3 year include . Forty child group assign either group A group B group C group D. child select family within Dhaka city come diarrhoea treatment centre ICDDR , B.Inclusion criteria:1 . Children age 1 3 year weight age 70 % 61 % NCHS standard.2 . Who come patient department ICDDR , B treatment acute water diarrhoea with3 . No sign vitamin A deficiency ( non invasive diarrhoea without systematic infection ) receive vitamin A last 4 months.4 . Who receive measles vaccine measles primarily identify study.5 . Children reside around Dhaka city After one week recovery diarrhoea:1 . Baseline immunological profile studied.2 . Intervention one week schedule dose immunological profile repeat 8 weeks.Study group : A. Zinc B. Vitamin A C. Zinc vitamin A D. PlaceboExclusion criteria:1 . Children need immediate vitamin A supplementation ( clear sign vitamin deficiency ) 2 . Children receive vitamin A within last 4 months3 . Children systematic infection4 . Subjects develop kind sign symptom vitamin A deficiency give vitamin A analysed separately.Randomisation procedure : Parents give consent study select . Children randomise four group receive either treatment . A master randomisation chart prepare use table permuted block design divide serial number four equal group . There need stratification accord selection criterion , good nourish ( 70 % wt/age ) severely malnourish ( 60 % ) child exclude . Severely malnourished patient diarrhoea may immediately need vitamin A well nourished show effect supplement . Steps keep compensate dropouts.The intervention non-intervention group receive identical bottle syrups flavour single unique serial number write outside bottle . The number indicate exact subject study keep reach investigator . The child receive 2nd dose 8 week vitamin A zinc receive first dose without break randomization code . The code broken completion study analysis accord groups.Base line survey do take socio-economic information , dietary habit , previous illness , immunization , wash hand water use , frequency cook food contain vit A , cook method , frequency use green leafy vegetables.In begin study , baseline vitamin A status determine use MRDR test . Anthropometry do select child baseline , end 8 week , subsequent month 6 month . Duration , frequency , dose : One teaspoonful , ( 5 ml ) syrup give twice-daily schedule 7 days.Composition syrup : For group , main vehicle bulk base syrup consist chemical ; addition , group either treatment substance ( i.e . zinc vitamin A none ) .Syrup A : Quantity per 5 ml Zinc acetate 20 mg elemental Syrup B : Vitamin A palmitate 15,000IU Syrup C : Zinc : 20 mg elemental + vitamin A : 15,000 IU Syrup D : Y base substance Base substance : Ascorbic acid 30 mg Glycerine USP 1.2 ml Propylene glycol USP 0.75 ml Sorbitol 70 % BP 2.0 ml Methyl Paraban USFN 3.5 mg Polysorbate-80 50 mg ( Tween-80 ) BPC Lemon oil pH grade 0.0125 ml Caramel Brown colour 1 mg Powder water 0.75 ml Organization study : The study conduct among child attend patient department clinical research centre ICDDR , B . Children select acute diarrhoea phase attend non invasive simple mild diarrhoea within nutritional status define earlier NCHS standard . The child take study 1 week recovery diarrhoea first immunological test base line do time . Mothers instruct dose . A twice-daily dose syrup one week schedule well compliance child . After completion dose 8 week , immunity test repeat 8 week . Tears collect small piece sponge use secretary 1 gA estimation . Skin test Cell Medicated Immunity perform child regardless treatment group multitest kit develop Institute Merieux . These child follow every alternate day 1st week weekly development illness 2 month . Necessary treatment measure undertaken.Clinical care : Patient care provide clinical problem identify treatment diarrhoea follow . A team medical officer paramedic examine record vitamin A deficiency symptom medical problem predesigned questionnaire provide necessary care . Any child develop acute symptom night blindness Bitot ’ spot give vitamin A capsule ( 200,000 ) recorded.Baseline test immunity perform following test : Components immunity variables:1 . Eight antigens multiple skin test measure 48 hours.2 . Eight 1gA , 1gM3 . MRDR , plasma 1gA , 1gM , 1gG . ( This require 2 ml blood ) 4 . Lymphocyte proliferation assays.For T lymphocytes- PHA , Con A antigen use For T B lymphocytes – PWM ( Poke weed Mitogen ) ( This require 3 ml blood heparinized tube ) 5 . Lymphocyte Phenotype use monoclonal antibody CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD20.Schedules : immunity test , skin test dose 8 week . MRDR do base line 8 weeks.6 . Base line titre measles antibody 1gG measure follow dose measles vaccine titre measure 8 week supplementation.7 . ‘ Serum zinc , RBP , albumin &amp; alkaline phosphatase baseline 8 week.Anthropometry do weight , height , MUAC , base line , 8 weeks.Body weight- measure ( nude ) electronic scale 1gLength : - measure knee-heel vernier 1mm sensitivity .
