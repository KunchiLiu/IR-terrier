	<detailed_description>Computerized dynamic posturography outcome obtain elite level gymnast non gymnast age match . The outcome measurement obtain use computerized dynamic posturography , standard diagnostic test balance function ( 41-46 ) . The subject 's balance test use three-component force platform ( CAPS test ) one sensory condition modify Clinical Test Sensory Interaction Balance ( mCTSIB ) , eye close perturb surface condition . This condition choose study show single test best correlate balance impairment fall . The stability score , already use several study author use primary outcome measure research . It define 1 minus ratio measure sway test ( computed major axis standard 95 % confidence ellipse ) amount sway normal subject height one test able sway fall ( also know theoretical maximum sway theoretical limit stability , calculate use regression formula base subject 's height develop NASA 1962 commonly use posturographic test ) . For convenience , stability score express percentage . Its definition make convenient easy understand measure use subject able stand perfectly still sway score 100 % , whereas one sway much limit stability score 0 % . During test , subject 's sway determine force platform relate software . The CAPS three-component force platform use 3 load cell arrange triangle measure distribution vertical ground reaction force platform . The analog load cell signal amplify simultaneously sample platform electronics use three synchronize individual 24bit delta-sigma analog digital converter sample 312kHz decimate sample data rate 64Hz . The use three A/D converter insure signal 3 load cell acquire simultaneously time error . The high sampling rate high decimation low data rate sigma-delta converter eliminate aliasing provide resolution 4 part per million . The digital load cell data send via USB connection PC software use calibration matrix determine manufacturer compute total vertical force two horizontal moment act platform . From data , software compute point application vertical force act platform , commonly refer Center Pressure ( CoP ) . The location CoP coincide static condition projection subject 's Center Mass ( CoM ) onto platform , movement relate movement subject 's CoM ( sway ) . The determination actual sway require determination instantaneous location CoM via location inertial property body segment specific subject test . The CAPS test , like posturographic equipment , use movement CoP approximation sway . Because approximation , kinetic reason CoP move CoM , 95 % confidence interval CoP motion consider . This allow CAPS software compute ellipse represent location sway sample collect test 95 % confidence . The major axis ellipse represent maximum sway subject direction test use compute stability score . To assess accuracy resolution measurement chain , calibrate weight 75kg 100kg position center force platform ( subject ) 20 acquisition perform : accuracy weight must within instrument 's factory specification ( +-2N ) . Therefore accuracy position claim manufacturer +-1mm weight 75kg accept correct determination require specialized equipment software available manufacturer . It note overall accuracy position CoP give instrument relevant study motion CoP determine sway . The sway measurement error estimate consider fact test weight dead weight must move , measurement chain indicate `` sway '' le 0.05mm ( measurement noise ) , therefore resolution measurement chain sway measurement error consider 0.05mm . To verify repeatability measurement chain , type test repeat two time , obtain similar result ( within specify accuracy resolution ) . Given sway measurement error , measurement error stability score determine . From definition stability score clear least theoretical limit stability , pronounced effect sway measurement error . As theoretical limit stability compute use formula 0.55*height*2*sin ( 6.25Â° ) , short subject , stability score sensitive measurement error . To estimate stability score measurement error subject 's height 1.6m consider . Such subject theoretical limit stability 191.6mm . For subject , sway measurement error 0.05mm mean stability score measurement error 0.05/191.6 , score express percentage , 0.026 % . Thus , change stability score great consequence subject 's sway measurement error . A CAPS dynamic posturography test eye close perturbed stance obtain subject . Subjects instructed stand foam platform close eye data obtain computerized force plate . The subject give practice session familiar test prior collection data . The CAPS test occur 25 second . We divide degree sway observe first half test second half test obtain ratio . Subjects whose sway increase second half test reference first half identified demonstrating fatigability ratio . Individuals demonstrate less sway second half test identify demonstrate adaptability ratio consider might relate type motor learning . All gymnast instruct novel gymnastic routine include variety inverted posture ground routine unfamiliar subject . The athlete allow practice routine one hour ask perform routine front judge blind outcome measure previously obtain . The performance score compare CDP measurement ascertain would relationship .</detailed_description>
