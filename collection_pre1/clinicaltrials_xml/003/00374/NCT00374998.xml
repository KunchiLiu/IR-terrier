	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity Study Malaria Vaccines FP9 PP MVA PP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaria infection kill 2 million people year . It major problem live endemic area traveller . There clearly great need safe effective malaria vaccine . The purpose study test two candidate malaria vaccine ( FP9-PP MVA-PP ) different concentration combination . These live viral vector encode ’ polyprotein ’ six fuse malaria antigen express liver blood stage malaria parasite lifecycle . MVA-PP us Modified Virus Ankara vector , weaken form smallpox vaccine , vaccinia . FP9-PP us highly attenuate avian pox virus ( FP9 ) vector instead . The two vaccine use combination ’ prime boost ’ strategy enhance response cellular immune system . This study : 1 . Examine safety 2 . Examine immunogenicity 3 . Provide subgroup vaccinated volunteer test clinical efficacy follow malaria challenge study ( VAC027.2 )</detailed_description>
