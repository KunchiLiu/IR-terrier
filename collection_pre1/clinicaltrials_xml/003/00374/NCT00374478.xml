	<brief_title>Effects Transdermal Scopolamine Occupational Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our study propose use randomize crossover placebo control design test effect transdermal scopolamine vs. placebo simulate ship navigation performance condition heavy sea . We hypothesize mariner experience great decrement navigational performance placebo condition vs. transdermal scopolamine , face simulate heavy sea . Study staff apply transdermal scopolamine patch placebo patch , 8 hour prior performance assessment . Participants surrender car key agree stay Kalmar Maritime Campus dismiss study . A study nurse and/or study physician call time patch application study participant dismiss study . Eight hour follow patch application participant perform navigation task , stormy weather condition , bridge simulation lab Kalmar Maritime Academy . Participants repeat protocol one week later opposite dose condition . This study conduct Kalmar Maritime Academy , Kalmar , Sweden .</detailed_description>
