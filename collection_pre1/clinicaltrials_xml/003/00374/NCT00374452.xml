	<brief_summary>This project VA HSR &amp; D-funded Quality Enhancement Research Initiative ( QUERI ) project translate practice evidence clinical management primary hypertension . The project aim contribute quality improvement care patient primary hypertension . The project implement clinical decision support system primary care clinician evaluate implementation study impact clinician ' prescribe patient ' blood pressure , also study organizational factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>VISN Collaborative Improving Hypertension Management With ATHENA-HTN</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background / Rationale : Despite existence evidence-based guideline , gap evidence-based recommend best medical practice actual practice . In previous work , use hypertension model study translation research clinical target drug choice primary care practice computer-based implementation clinical practice guideline . In collaboration expert guideline-automation Stanford Center Biomedical Informatics Research ( BMIR ) , develop innovative clinical decision support system : ATHENA-HTN ( hypertension ) . We demonstrate deploy sophisticated system VA primary care clinic feasible clinician find system usable useful , show actual extensive use system response questionnaire survey . We also find system improved clinician prescribing . Objective ( ) : Our objective QUERI-funded VISN Implementation Collaborative include : ( 1 ) implement evidence-based guideline hypertension upgrade ATHENA knowledge-base ( KB ) recent guideline ; ( 2 ) deploy system 5 medical center within VISN 1 generate individualize recommendation primary care clinician care patient outpatient clinic ; ( 3 ) evaluate implementation . Methods : In Phase 1 plan update KB conduct offline testing ; revise M program extract patient data daily VistA extract additional data element ; streamline system architecture make easy implement multiple site ; work site-PIs obtain IRB approval 5 implementation site VISN 1 plus coordinate site VA Palo Alto ; improve user interface design ; identify resolve issue implement new information technology multiple different VAMCs different CPRS implementation ; train site PIs use system ; perform baseline data analysis inform randomization . In Phase 2 plan recruit primary care provider participate 5 medical center VISN 1 ; randomize clinic ATHENA-HTN intervention usual care ; deploy system intervention provider ; train intervention provider use system ; conduct 12-month clinical trial system . In Phase 3 plan analyze result clinical trial . Status : As November 2010 , Phase 3 project . We complete IRB approval five medical center . We update knowledgebase conduct offline testing . Our system deploy five medical center . We 've develop new code run system thin client environment . We 've also develop HTML new graphical interface , automatic blood pressure update day visit , code blood pressure write back VistA . Due difficulty appoint programmer staff defer plan program new user interface ( do separate project future use ) . Our site principal investigator project coordinator train intervention provider five medical center use system . One medical center complete use ATHENA-HTN system training period continue intervention period . VA Palo Alto staff work staff VAMC validate ATHENA-HTN data site . We complete 6-8 month intervention period clinical trial four five medical center . 103 primary care provider five medical center participate trial active intervention period site . Our random allocation clinic ( substation ) level . As May 2011 , close IRB 5 medical center VISN 1 New England ; conduct data analysis VA Palo Alto . We complete validate extract data , compute variable establish subset datasets specific analysis . We conduct primary outcome analyse whether pharmacotherapy hypertension intensify . We also conduce secondary outcome analysis , time permit , per detail write data analysis plan . Impact : Our VISN Collaborative study provide insight upgrade automate guideline ( important issue light rapid change clinical knowledge guideline ) integrate system VA electronic medical record across multiple VAMCs . We learn barrier facilitator clinician guideline adherence , impact quality improvement strategy clinician prescribe patient blood pressure , learn clinical decision support system best implemented assist clinician provide evidence-based care patient</detailed_description>
