A randomized , control , pre post study conduct . Subjects ( patient-surrogate dyad ) randomize PC-ACP usual care control group . Data ass feasibility , clinical sociodemographic data , baseline measure patient surrogate outcome collect subject enter study . Measures patient surrogate outcome data ass acceptability intervention administer one week follow . Findings study critical strengthen PC-ACP design randomize controlled trial test efficacy improve quality patient-clinician communication quality decision make future medical care African American patient , comparison non-Hispanic Whites .</detailed_description>
