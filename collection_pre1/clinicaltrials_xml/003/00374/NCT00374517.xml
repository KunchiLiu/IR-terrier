	<brief_summary>This study determine whether drug call pimonidazole hydrochloride show area low oxygen tuberculosis ( TB ) -infected lung . Pimonidazole `` low oxygen marker , '' agent design find area body get enough oxygen . If find TB grow oxygen low , result may help doctor decide medicine would effective treat TB . Patients 20 year age old schedule lung surgery National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital Masan , Korea treat TB may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Blood draw surgery test hepatitis B hepatitis C virus . - Pregnancy test woman become pregnant . - Infusion pimonidazole vein arm 24 hour surgery . A part patient 's lung remove surgery . This tissue examine microscope evidence pimonidazole , would indicate low oxygen . - Blood sample collection surgery 7th 14th day surgery check liver function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase II clinical trial establish whether pulmonary tuberculous lesion hypoxic contain hypoxic microenvironments use vivo hypoxia-imaging marker , pimonidazole hydrochloride , subject undergoing lung resection surgery treatment-refractory pulmonary tuberculosis . The study population drawn subject undergoing treatment National Masan Tuberculosis Hospital ( NMTH ) , Masan , Republic Korea . Subjects schedule partial lung resection surgery treatment refractory TB eligible study . Selected subject demonstrate one radiographic abnormality associate pulmonary tuberculosis ( e.g. , cavity , nodule , consolidation , fibrosis , calcified lesion ) . Subjects undergoing elective pulmonary resection receive single preoperative IV dose pimonidazole 0.5 g/m ( 2 ) 100 mL normal saline , infuse 20 minute 18 24 hour prior surgery . The resected tissue analyze look follow : 1 ) degree pimonidazole-adduct formation tissue specimens different histopathologic presentation ; 2 ) number acid-fast bacilli tissue section , smear , culture prepare homogenized lesion distinct gross anatomic histopathologic type relation extent tissue hypoxia , ; 3 ) comparison lesion label pimonidazole presence human cellular bacterial marker expect expressed oxygen-limiting condition . NIAID study investigator input kind selecting subject surgery , determine kind extent surgical resection . Subjects study day surgery approximately 8 week surgery .</detailed_description>
