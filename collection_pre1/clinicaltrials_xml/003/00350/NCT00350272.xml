	<brief_summary>Elvucitabine novel nucleoside analog studied treatment patient infect HIV-1 . This Phase II study enroll 60 HIV-1 naive subject assess efficacy safety elvucitabine compare lamivudine combination tenofovir efavirenz measure change patient 's HIV-RNA level CD4 cell count . The study treatment 12 week blind study medication follow additional 84 week open label treatment patient 's response treatment meet certain endpoint . Also assessment pharmacokinetics elvucitabine study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Sixty HIV-1-infected , clinically stable , treatment-na√Øve adult acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) -defining event 3 month prior screen randomly assign 1 2 treatment group . Subject plasma HIV-1 RNA level must great equal 5000 copies/mL CD4 cell count must great 200 cells/mL less 500 cells/mL Screening . Subjects must sensitive elvucitabine , lamivudine , emtricitabine demonstrate absence M184V , M184I , D237E mutation TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit . Subjects must genotypically sensitive efavirenz ( negative K103 Y188L mutation ) tenofovir ( negative K65R mutation ) demonstrate TRUGENE HIV-1 Genotyping Kit . They must acceptable hematologic chemistry parameter . Subjects whose HIV-1 RNA level decrease least 2 log 400 copies/mL Week 10 may consider eligible enter extension phase 36 week additional treatment . Subjects extension phase evaluate Weeks 14 , 16 , every 4 week week 96 . Once subject complete 12 week treatment , data available visit Week 12 , database lock treatment assignment unblinded . Any subject less 48 week treatment allow continue treatment initially assign open-label basis 48 week . All subject 2 post treatment follow-up visit , 1 4 week end treatment . Concentrations elvucitabine plasma measure Day 1 , Weeks 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , Follow-up Efficacy assess measure plasma HIV-1 RNA level CD4 count study visit . Safety evaluation include vital sign , physical examination , electrocardiogram , assessment adverse event ( AEs ) , measurement plasma HIV-1 RNA level CD4 count , determination HIV-1 genotype Screening , Weeks 12 , 24 , 48 96 determination HIV-1 phenotype Visit 1 Weeks 12 , 24 , 48 , 96 urine serum pregnancy test , well laboratory analysis include hematology , chemistry , urinalysis .</detailed_description>
