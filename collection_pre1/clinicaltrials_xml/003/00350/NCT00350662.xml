	<brief_title>Study With Deferiprone and/or Desferrioxamine Iron Overloaded Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients refractory anemias require regular blood transfusion accumulate iron rate approximately 0.5 mg/kg/day , may lead serious organ toxicity . The human body active mechanism excretion excess iron . Therefore multiply transfuse patient develop secondary hemosiderosis , iron excretion achieve chelating agent . Symptoms iron-overload occur body iron store reach 10-20 g. At high level severe , even fatal complication , particularly cardiac failure , may develop . Desferrioxamine ( DFO , Desferal ) establish commonly use iron-chelating drug , expensive must give slow subcutaneous intravenous infusion 8-12 hour day 5-7 day weekly dosage 40-50mg/kg body weight/day . This often lead failure compliance patient therefore inefficient iron chelation . Further patient hypersensitive desferrioxamine others suffer toxicity , e.g . ear eyes . Deferiprone ( L1 ; CP20 ; 1,2 dimethyl-3-hydroxy-pyrid-4-one ) orally active iron chelator investigate various clinical trial since 1987 . Dosages 75 - 100mg/kg body weight/day L1 find effective maintain stable iron balance ( urinary iron excretion 0.5mg/kg/day ) reduce serum ferritin level 6 % 25 % within one year treatment iron-overloaded thalassemic patient . There exist long-term experience patient receive deferiprone continuously 10 year far . However , control comparison study L1 DFO perform far order confirm effectiveness deferiprone . The main side effect encounter deferiprone therapy arthropathy , gastrointestinal symptom , headache , mild zinc deficiency . These adverse effect usually reverse reduce dose discontinue drug . Except severe joint symptom patient , subject different clinical trial able continue L1 therapy long-term . The severe rare complication follow L1 administration agranulocytosis neutropenia . A new treatment regimen combine deferiprone desferrioxamine currently investigate many country . Preliminary data could demonstrate combine use drug highly active showing synergistic even additive effect ( significant decrease serum ferritin hepatic iron content , increase urinary iron excretion ) . This synergism could explain different mode activity two drug . It could demonstrate patient sufficiently chelate desferrioxamine deferiprone , could achieve negative iron balance combination treatment drug . The combined regimen generally well-tolerated evidence individual toxicity profile drug positively influence simultaneous administration L1 DFO . The daily treatment L1 tablet combine twice week administration parenteral desferrioxamine patient-convenient therefore may enhance compliance patient . In addition , new treatment regimen reduce overall therapy expense compare high Desferal material cost related parenteral administration DFO 5 7 day per week . The result previous study deferiprone often comparable , e.g . laboratory parameter , toxicity side effect vary study study . The number patient include clinical investigation general low allow statistically significant evaluation . Further , control randomize study comprise appropriate number patient order allow comparison combination arm single agent control arm . This study protocol aim evaluate feasibility combination treatment compare efficacy safety combine drug single agent treatment L1 DFO iron-overloaded patient thalassemia refractory anemia control randomize multicenter study .</detailed_description>
