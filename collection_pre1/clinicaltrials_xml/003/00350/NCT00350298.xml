	<detailed_description>This study phase II , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study patient diagnose Clostridium difficile associate disease . Patients Clostridium difficile associate disease identify either stool test result physician referral , fulfill eligibility criterion approach participate . All study patient must receive standard care treatment Clostridium difficile associate disease . Enrolled patient randomize receive single intravenous solution human monoclonal antibody C. difficile toxin A ( GS-CDA1 ) combine human monoclonal antibody C. difficile toxin B ( MDX-1388 ) 0.9 % sodium chloride placebo 1:1 treatment allocation . One hundred patient enrolled combination monoclonal antibody treat arm 100 patient enrol placebo arm . Patients evaluate day 84 ± 10 day receipt study infusion safety clinical outcome . Blood sample safety analysis , anti-toxin A anti-toxin B antibody measurement human anti-human antibody ( HAHA ) titer collect scheduled time . Study visit occur day 3 ± 1 , 10 ± 2 , 28 ± 3 , 56 ± 7 day 84 ± 10 day . Occurrence adverse event , use concomitant medication , record stool output assess schedule phone contact study visit . The first 20 patient enrolled subsequent visit day 168 ± 14 day additional blood collection HAHA analysis .</detailed_description>
