	<brief_summary>The goal study validate BreathID 13C-methacetin breath test ( MBT ) non-invasive simple-to-use metabolic test , could utilize detect severe liver fibrosis ( &gt; 2 METAVIR ) patient chronic HCV liver disease.The test breath-test use free-standing device ( BreathID® ) measure metabolization 13C-labeled substrate ( 13C-methacetin ) real time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Percutaneous liver biopsy utilized decade assess severity chronic HCV liver disease . During procedure core sample liver obtain examine histologically presence inflammation , fibrosis feature characteristic specific liver disorder . Several grade system develop past 2 decade quantify overall severity liver biopsy specimen . Although liver biopsy gold standard ass liver disease severity , procedure significant limitation . Liver biopsy costly , invasive procedure risk morbidity mortality may cause discomfort patient . Percutaneous liver biopsy associate potential complication , include bleeding ( 1 % -3 % ) , pain ( 20 % -30 % ) , bile peritonitis ( &lt; 1 % ) , pneumothorax ( &lt; 1 % ) , puncture viscera ( &lt; 1 % ) , death . In addition , liver biopsy examination liver histology subject sample variation manner finding evaluate report individual pathologist . Breath test 13C-labeled substrate provide safe , non-invasive mean evaluate hepatic metabolism correlate liver histology . 13C stable , non-radioactive isotope , incorporate specific location within test substrate would release compound metabolize liver . Ideally , 13C-compound would need administer orally , rapidly absorb , exclusively metabolize liver metabolism 13C would measure exhaled breath within 20-30 minute . Hepatic metabolism compound assess measure ratio 13C/12C exhale breath . The ability detect , differentiate quantify 13C 12C exhale CO2 greatly facilitate recent development BreathID® collection system analyzer unit . The compound select study 13C-methacetin . Methacetin meet qualification excellent substrate liver breath test . It non-toxic small molecule . 13C synthesized key location within agent . It administer orally solution . It rapidly absorb metabolize hepatic microsome process release CO2 by-product exhale breath . No report complication side effect use substance report . 13C-methacetin rapidly absorb metabolize healthy liver cell acetaminophen 13CO2 . The resultant CO2 measure exhaled breath . The amount metabolize methacetin indicate capability liver accomplish one main physiological task show correlate liver fibrosis cirrhosis .</detailed_description>
