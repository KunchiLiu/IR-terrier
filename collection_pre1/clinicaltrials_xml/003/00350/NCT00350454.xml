	<brief_title>Rapamycin-Eluting Stents With Different Polymer Coating Reduce Restenosis ( ISAR-TEST-3 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery reblockage remain still drawback percutaneous coronary intervention even era drug-eluting stent ( DES ) . DESs work principle consist delivery control amount antiproliferative agent local level , result suppression neointimal proliferation , main cause lumen re-narrowing stent implantation . At present , several DES platform develop evaluated clinical use . They differ regard stent type , anti-proliferative drug , presence polymer employ drug storage modification drug-release kinetics well type polymer use purpose . Although mid-term efficacy well-established , ongoing debate potential increase incidence late stent thrombosis , particularly discontinuation thienopyridine therapy , well delay onset restenosis catch-up phenomenon DESs . Based animal human pathological data , investigator link above-mentioned concern presence polymer DESs , proinflammatory prothrombinogenic potential , sometimes may induce hypersensitivity reaction . This trial compare anti-restenotic efficacy permanent polymer ( PP ) , biodegradable polymer ( BP ) polymer-free ( PF ) rapamycin-eluting stent patient coronary artery disease . Cypher stent ( PP ) stainless steel stent coat sirolimus use permanent polymer ISAR stent rough surface stainless steel stent allow polymeric coating ( example biodegradable polymer , BP ISAR stent ) also coat without need polymer ( PF ISAR stent ) cath lab .</detailed_description>
