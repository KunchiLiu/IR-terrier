	<detailed_description>Facial expression complex signal last minute important communicate intention , motivation , emotional state . In human , variety neurological psychiatric condition alter tendency use facial signal . One main symptom Parkinson disease ( PD ) diminish facial expressivity `` masked facies , '' refer expressionless appearance individual disorder . Unfortunately , little progress make year regard basis `` mask face '' strategy might improve facial expressivity among individual PD . This unfortunate particular symptom significant medical social consequence range misdiagnosis depression misattribution negative emotional state motivation family member healthcare provider . The goal trial study effectiveness novel , behavioral treatment approach—high intensity respiratory muscle strength training ( MST ) —for blunt facial expression people PD . The MST device , mouthpiece participant use inspire resistance , may improve strength mobility muscle around mouth involved form facial expression . Study participation include screening , baseline evaluation , 4 week behavioral intervention , immediate post-treatment followup , 3-month follow-up . Participants randomly assign take part high intensity respiratory MST , Sham MST . Participation study last approximately 5 month .</detailed_description>
