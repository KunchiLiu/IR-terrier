	<brief_title>Clonidine-induced Spinal Acetylcholine Release : Normal Volunteers vs. Neuropathic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study part pain center grant focus pain , especially chronic neuropathic pain , alters response traditional non-traditional analgesic ( pain medication ) . The way nerve fiber carry pain information brain think change surgery case chronic pain . For reason , medicine work well relieve pain healthy people sudden painful injury compare people surgery people chronic pain . Currently available pain medication may relieve type pain may relieve pain dos produce side effect potential complication . The aim study understand mechanism intrathecal clonidine ( clonidine inject cerebrospinal fluid ) increase potency efficacy examine cerebrospinal fluid healthy individual , clonidine administration , well look spinal fluid people chronic neuropathic nerve pain . More specifically , study , researcher compare acetylcholine release ( protein-like substance find cerebrospinal fluid ) normal volunteer patient neuropathic pain single injection clonidine . After baseline measurement , include blood pressure heart rate , participant train accurately estimate pain way thermal heat test . Next small amount spinal fluid withdrawn participant measure amount naturally-made chemical participant ' cerebrospinal fluid . Participants receive injection clonidine . After injection , additional sample spinal fluid take measure chemical change fluid . Duration study participant 1 day , include 1 visit research center , last approximately 3 hour .</detailed_description>
