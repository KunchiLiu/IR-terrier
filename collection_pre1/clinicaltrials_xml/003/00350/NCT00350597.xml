	<detailed_description>This pilot study describe immunological response clinical outcome associate administration recombinant human Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ( GM-CSF ) surgical adjuvant therapy patient malignant melanoma high risk recurrence ( Stage II T4 , III IV ) . The immunological response include serum neopterin level . In sub-set study participant , additional immunologic test do , include monocyte cytotoxicity melanoma cell line phenotypic functional marker dendritic T cell activation peripheral blood mononuclear cell . The clinical end point study include safety , time disease recurrence , time disseminated disease , survival . Eligible patient high-risk melanoma clinically tumor free follow surgery . Treatment consist GM-CSF 125 g/m2 daily ( maximum dose 250 g ) 14 day follow 14 day rest ( 28 day cycle ) 1 year . Clinical status monitor death patient tumor free five year , whichever event occur first . Immunologic response determine pretreatment , end first 14 day dose ( Day 15 ) , 14-day rest period ( Day 29 ) end 14 day dose cycle 6 ( Day 155 ) 13 ( Day 351 ) . Clinical outcome determine accord patient risk group ( ultra-high risk Stage IIIC IV versus high-risk Stage II T4 , Stage IIIA Stage IIIB ) . The pilot study also assess association immunological response clinical response safety patient risk group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Eligible patient male female histologically proven melanoma . Patients must Stage II ( T4 ) , III , IV malignant melanoma surgically resect clinical evidence disease clinical , laboratory criterion radiologic examination define . Individuals must least 14 year age . Pregnant woman eligible . Men woman require use effective form contraception . Patients require corticosteroid therapy receive form immunotherapy eligible . Patients may receive immunotherapy prior disease . They must complete therapy least one month prior study entry . Patients may receive prior chemotherapy therapy GMCSF . Patients permit receive adjuvant radiation therapy patient select part subset undergoing study cellular immunologic response since radiation could alter response . Based reults one randomize , control clinical trial , LEUKINE product label contains follow contraindication : “ Due potential sensitivity rapidly divide hematopoietic progenitor cell , LEUKINE administer simultaneously cytoxic chemotherapy radiotherapy within 24 hour precede follow chemotherapy radiotherapy . In one controlled study , patient small cell lung cancer receive LEUKINE concurrent thoracic radiotherapy chemotherapy identical radiotherapy chemotherapy without LEUKINE . The patient randomize LEUKINE significantly high incidence adverse event , include high mortality high incidence grade 4 infection grade 3 4 thrombocytopenia.28 ” Other investigator report CMCSF give safely concurrent radiation therapy . These contrast result may relate difference patient population intensity and/or location site radiotherapy body , among factor . GMCSF administer safely combination radiation therapy treatment head neck cancers29,30 use safely regimens combine chemotherapy radiation therapy.31 Patients must undergo examination evidence residual disease , include physical examination , CBC , chemistry panel , CT scan chest abdomen ( pelvis low extremity low trunk lesion ) , single sequence gadolinium MRI CT brain . A PET scan may substitute CT chest abdomen ( pelvis ) . These test must negative residual disease entry study . Administration protocol medication must initiate within 90 day definitive surgical excision render patient NED . Patients meet Inclusion Criteria describe</criteria>
