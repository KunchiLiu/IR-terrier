	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Rituximab Corticosteroid Therapy Newly Diagnosed Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective treatment chronic GVHD currently limit corticosteroid , often require prolonged treatment . The addition calcineurin inhibitor associate increased response rate transplant-related mortality . Our laboratory study demonstrate allogeneic antibody develop association chronic GVHD HSCT . This implicate allogeneic B cell response pathogenesis chronic GVHD support test anti-B cell therapy chronic GVHD . In DFCI phase I trial 21 patient steroid refractory chronic GVHD , rituximab provide 70 % overall responses 2 complete response . Rituximab therapy facilitate corticosteroid taper median dose prednisone fall 40 mg/day trial initiation 10 mg/day one year ( p = 0.0002 ) . We hypothesize addition rituximab prednisone initial treatment chronic GVHD increase overall response rate , enable rapid effective steroid taper . If B cell product antibody contribute chronic GVHD pathogenesis , prednisone efficacy partially active less-specific B cell effect , follow rituximab addition prednisone may increase chronic GVHD response rate enable successful steroid tapering . To test hypothesis , initiate phase II clinical trial rituximab corticosteroid front line therapy patient newly diagnose chronic GVHD . Reported cGVHD trial test benefit add experimental agent prednisone dose 1mg/kg 4 9 month slowly taper fix schedule . In trial primary endpoint cGVHD complete response rate , 1mg/kg every day prednisone yield 33 % CR 62 % overall response rate 9 month therapy thereby set standard single agent high-dose prednisone achieve alone . However , long-term single-agent high-dose corticosteroid treatment cGVHD cause significant morbidity associate 20 % incidence avascular necrosis . On trial , 50 % could wean steroid 5 year . With steroid toxicity mind , believe clinically meaningful endpoint phase II test promise cGVHD drug may addition high-dose steroid enables successful steroid taper . As , primary endpoint ability successfully taper prednisone dose 0.25 mg/kg/day less six month without cGVHD relapse . The 0.25mg/kg/day primary endpoint choose physiological clinical practice reason . Patients receive prednisone 20mg daily great assume functional suppression hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal function , frequently suffer steroid toxicity . Clinically , many HSCT clinician taper patient 10-20 mg prednisone day slowly taper avoid chronic GVHD recurrence .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Both child adults new diagnosis chronic GVHD , must include skin involvement , indication systemic immunosuppressive treatment dose 1mg/kg prednisone undergone type donor hematopoietic cell graft condition regimen . See Appendix NIH Consensus Signs symptoms Chronic GVHD . The NIH cGVHD Working group recommendation Diagnosis chronic GVHD require diagnostic sign least 1 distinctive manifestation cGVHD diagnosis confirm pertinent biopsy radiology confirmation Schirmer 's test . The guideline indication start systemic steroid follow : 2 organ involve ( must include skin ) organ score e 2 ( see Appendix organ score ) Stable dos immunosuppressive medication ( e.g . calcineurin inhibitor , mycophenolate mofetil ) 2 week prior enrollment . In addition , immunosuppressive medication dose increase . Men woman reproductive potential must agree use acceptable method birth control treatment six month completion treatment . All subject must provide write informed consent . Known lifethreatening hypersensitivity Rituximab antiB cell antibody . Treatment prednisone ( equivalent ) dose high 1 mg/kg/day time enrollment . Persistent prednisone treatment acute GVHD le 1mg/kg allow ( i.e . Patient treat acute GVHD prednisone , develop chronic GVHD complete taper ) . Active , uncontrolled infection CMV reactivation exclude ( i.e . pneumonitis , colitis ) . Peripheral blood CMV reactivation allow long associate CMV disease respond therapy . Known Hepatitis B surface Ag positive Active malignant disease relapse . Pregnancy lactation Inability comply Rituximab treatment regimen .</criteria>
