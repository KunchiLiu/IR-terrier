	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine whether investigational drug cetuximab , ( Erbitux ) alone paclitaxel ( Taxol ) stabilize growth urothelial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Cetuximab With Without Weekly Paclitaxel Patients With Previously Treated Advanced Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study do find cetuximab , alone paclitaxel slow growth urothelial cancer . Cetuximab antibody block protein call epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . EGFR sit outside tumor cell control tumor cell growth . This agent look alone chemotherapy drug include paclitaxel . It find safe shrink type cancer . This research study also do find cetuximab , alone paclitaxel shrink urothelial tumor . If extends time tumor shrink . If helps people live longer . The purpose research study find effect ( good bad ) treatment cancer . We know benefit research study . It possible condition get good , also possible effect condition condition get bad . We use learn research study help people disease .</detailed_description>
