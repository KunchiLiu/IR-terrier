	<brief_title>Azacitidine Maintenance Therapy After Allogeneic Bone Marrow Transplantation ( Allo BMT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Azacitidine drug design block certain gene cancer cell whose job stop function tumor-fighting gene . By block `` bad '' gene , tumor-fighting gene may able work well . Before start treatment study , call `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . You complete medical history physical exam . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , give chemotherapy , transplant donor cell . There 2 major goal give chemotherapy . One goal directly kill leukemic cell . The goal block ability reject donor cell give transplantation . All participant receive combination 3 chemotherapy drug -- gemtuzumab , fludarabine , melphalan . In order receive gemtuzumab , bone marrow leukemia cell positive marker call `` CD33 , '' present majority myeloid leukemia . If cell negative marker , chemotherapy receive include gemtuzumab . Anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) give patient receive stem cell unrelated donor , relative fully match . All chemotherapy drug give vein silicone catheter . Gemtuzumab give 12 day transplant ( may give outpatient infusion ) . Fludarabine give day 4 day ( 5-2 day transplant ) , melphalan give single dose 2 day transplant . If receive ATG , drug give 3 dos , give 3-1days transplant . The transplant day usually refer `` Day 0 . '' A total 5 bone marrow biopsy collect first year transplantation -- start treatment , around 1 month transplantation , around 4 , 9 , 12 month transplantation . To collect bone marrow sample , area hip bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow bone withdrawn large needle . The bone marrow sample use primarily disease status evaluation , researcher also use sample research way azacitidine work . Eleven ( 11 ) blood sample ( 2 teaspoon ) collect research purpose 1 year participation study . Samples collect chemotherapy , stem cell transplantation , receive 5-azacitidine ( 4 cycle treatment ) , third week first cycle 5-azacitidine treatment . After blood-forming cell collect donor , give vein transplant . Before infusion , receive medication , steroid Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) , decrease risk side effect . These `` premedications '' give vein usually 30 60 minute transplant . You receive several medication help treatment work help decrease risks infection immune system weak . Tacrolimus methotrexate give decrease risk graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , problem may occur donor 's immune cell fight body . Tacrolimus start 2 day transplant continue variable period time ( e.g. , 3-12 month , long develop GVHD ) . Tacrolimus give vein first mouth , patient able eat . Methotrexate give vein 1 , 3 , 6 day transplantation . Several medication use prevention infection ( potentially cause fungal , bacterial , viral organism ) . Some antibiotic give vein , give pill , variable lengths time . You receive medication tacrolimus medication may weaken immune system ( steroid ) , order prevent infection , pneumonia . These antibiotic may include Bactrim , Diflucan , medication , necessary . You hospital 3-4 week transplant . You check-ups every day leave hospital . After leave , frequency clinic visit vary , depend condition . You may need come hospital often daily . If first bone marrow examination transplantation determine remission , eligible receive azacitidine one 3 dos . Your dose schedule administration decide start treatment . Participants enrol start small dose move upwards term dose , side effect detect . Each participant assign dose . This dose may decrease may stop may give certain side effect develop . Azacitidine give injection skin day 5 day row . This may repeat month 4 month transplant . You assign receive drug one four cycle . You 25 day `` rest '' cycle treatment ( cycle period 1 month. ) . If intolerable side effect occur , treatment azacitidine may interrupt stop altogether finish treatment . While study , need stay Houston 5 month transplant . You require return 9 12 month transplant , though frequency visit may higher , think necessary doctor . After 1 year , follow-up continue standard care disease . This investigational study . Azacitidine drug describe approved FDA . The use azacitidine allogeneic transplantation experimental.About 90 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
