	<brief_title>Spatial Neglect Bias Near Far Space</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Visual distraction problem often occur people suffer stroke general population . Problems visual attention generally appear immediately follow stroke , may impair drive function . While thought natural course improvement time , little known improvement occurs . Some study suggest recovery partial , mean certain aspect visual attention may improve aspect remain escape notice . The purpose study examine effect stroke person 's visual attention look object nearby versus far away , learn person 's visual attention may become distracted near versus far distance . The purpose study also understand modeled intervention , eye patch prism goggles , affect impairment measure visual attention . After initial screening ( include attention , think , memory , visual judgment test ) , participant give neurological examination . Participants may ask perform visual task wear eye patch prism goggles . Next , ask perform line bisection task look line video screen either close far distance , use laser pointer , mark center line appear on-screen . Participants may ask perform , similar visual task well . Duration study participant varies , range 1 2 session total approximately 2 hour multiple session span year . Research study may help researcher well understand problem associate stroke may lead therapy design promote improve visual attention .</detailed_description>
