	<detailed_description>This clinical trial evaluate efficacy adjunctive cognitive behavioral therapy negative symptom function chronic outpatient diagnose schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . After baseline assessment ensure eligibility , seventy-five consenting patient randomly assign receive year cognitive therapy ( CT ) treatment usual ( TAU ) control condition . Measures symptomatology ( positive , negative affective ) , function , neurocognition negativistic belief administer participant five formal assessment session occur 6-month interval course two-year period . The first assessment session ( Baseline ) occur shortly ( i.e. , within week , though typically day ) inform consent give . If participant qualifies study consent randomization , assessment identical baseline content occur 6 , 12 , 18 24 month later . All evaluator blind participant treatment condition time assessment . The cognitive behavioral treatment , collaborative problem solve manner , target inaccurate overly pessimistic expectation thought social non-social performance . This psychosocial intervention also target belief attitude related positive symptom , turn , exacerbate negative symptom impair function . We hypothesize patient CT condition lower negative symptom level elevate functioning compare TAU patient post-treatment assessment . Additionally , expect CT-treated patient continue improve follow-up period , thereby , continue manifest lower negative symptom elevate level function relative TAU patient . While research past 10 year demonstrate efficacy CT adjunct intervention treatment schizophrenia , negative symptom target directly , emphasis place upon improve functional outcome . Given negative symptom function particularly refractory population , need treatment innovation . In vein , previous research ( Grant &amp; Beck , 2006 ) establish defeatist attitude regard social non-social performance important mediator causal chain link neurocognitive performance , negative symptom , functional outcome schizophrenia . The current trial , thus , aim move therapy schizophrenia forward improve long-term outcome impaired individual psychiatric service .</detailed_description>
