	<detailed_description>Bone third common organ involve metastasic disease behind lung liver . In breast cancer , bone second common site metastatic spread , 90 % patient die breast cancer bone metastasis . Breast prostate cancer metastasize bone frequently , reflect high incidence tumor , well prolonged clinical course . Post cancer survival increase improvement early detection treatment . As consequence , number patient develop metastatic bone disease lifetime also increase . Patients bone metastasis breast cancer average 2-year survival time presentation first bone lesion . In patient die breast , prostate , lung cancer , autopsy study show 85 % evidence bone metastasis time death . Current treatment patient bone metastasis primarily palliative include localized therapy ( radiation surgery ) , systemic therapy ( chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , radiopharmaceutical , bisphosphanates ) , analgesic ( opioids non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ) . Recently , radiofrequency ablation test treatment option bone metastasis . The main goal treatment improvement quality life functional level . These goal describe : 1 ) Pain relief , 2 ) Preservation restoration function , 3 ) Local tumor control , 4 ) Skeletal stabilization . The study hypothesis MRgFUS safe potentially effective non-invasive treatment metastatic bone tumor low incidence co-morbidity . Based result study Sponsor initiate large study effort approve metastatic bone tumor indication MRgFUS ExAblate device .</detailed_description>
