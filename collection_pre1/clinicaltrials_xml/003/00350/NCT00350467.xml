	<brief_summary>This randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , double-blind ( neither patient physician know whether drug placebo take , dosage ) , active-controlled , flexible-dose , parallel group , multicenter study . The study consist screen phase , double-blind treatment phase ( 6 week ) safety follow-up phase ( 1 week ) . The patient study randomize 1 2 treatment group receive extend release OROS paliperidone Olanzapine daily 6-week double-blind treatment phase . Randomization occur ratio 1 ( extend release OROS paliperidone ) 1 ( Olanzapine ) . Patients must hospitalize least 14 day entry . Those receive extended release OROS paliperidone start dosage 6 mg take daily , dose may titrate 3mg/day every 7 day , rapidly base balance efficacy ( effectiveness drug ) safety/tolerability assess investigator . After initial 7 day , dose could flexible within 3-12mg/day . Those receive olanzapine start dosage 5mg take daily , dose may titrate 5mg/day every 7 day , rapidly base balance efficacy safety/tolerability assess investigator . After initial 7 day , dose could flexible within 5-15mg/day .
