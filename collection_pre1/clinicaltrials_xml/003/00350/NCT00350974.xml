	<brief_summary>Asymmetric dimethylarginine , ADMA , plasma , significantly elevate patient renal disease associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality . We find whole blood ( WB ) possess metabolic pathway require generation elimination ADMA develop ex vivo method assess WB accumulation ADMA human . The over-arching hypothesis dysregulation ADMA metabolic pathway lead great ADMA whole blood content great capacity accumulate ADMA , 1 ) reflect plasma level 2 ) good predictor cardiovascular outcome plasma level end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . The follow specific aim pursue characterize whole blood ADMA ESRD : 1 . Compare contrast baseline free plasma ADMA total whole blood ( free plus protein-incorporated ) ADMA concentration ESRD patient , match hypertensive control normal population . 2 . Determine capacity WB accumulate ( net balance generation elimination ) ADMA ESRD patient , match hypertensive control normal population . We use state-of-the-art , high performance liquid chromatography technique measure ADMA level plasma whole blood . Samples ADMA measurement obtain subject end-stage renal disease immediately dialysis treatment . Samples also obtain volunteer without kidney disease . This group match end-stage renal volunteer age , gender ethnicity . These volunteer also match presence hypertension diabetes . The third group consist normal population measure normal level ADMA compare two group . There grow evidence support pathological role ADMA human . These experiment enhance understand ADMA process human body associate kidney disease . Potentially , result lay groundwork new insight link ADMA high cardiovascular disease burden patient kidney disease .</brief_summary>
