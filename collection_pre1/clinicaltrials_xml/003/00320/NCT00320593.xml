	<detailed_description>Myopia significant public health problem affect least 34 % child United States much high percentage Asia . It predispose factor retinal detachment , myopic retinopathy , glaucoma , thus contribute loss vision blindness . As might expect prevalent condition , treatment cost high . If intervention retard myopia progression successful , sight-threatening complication might avoid cost reduce . The study design simple trial , type lens determine randomization process addition accommodation test use autorefractor , largely approximate standard clinical practice . Screening consist non-cycloplegic procedure subjective refraction , test oculomotor alignment , test accommodative response use Grand Seiko autorefractor . Patients appear eligible randomized trial test eye dilate determine whether refractive error eye within eligibility range randomize trial . Patients randomize either progressive addition lens ( PALs ) +2.00 D addition single vision lens ( SVLs ) . Children three year follow , visit every 6 month . The primary outcome visit time 3 year randomization , primary analysis comparison average change baseline 3 year amount myopia child single-vision lens group child progressive-addition lens group . The primary outcome change spherical equivalent refractive error ( SER ) diopter ( D ) measure cycloplegic autorefraction . A separate ancillary study nest within screen process collect data two additional method measure accommodation , Monocular Estimate Method ( MEM ) retinoscopy Nott retinoscopy . The aim ancillary study help determine whether simple , effective measure exist easily use clinician identify child reduce accommodative response , low myopia esophoria , might benefit treatment PALs .</detailed_description>
