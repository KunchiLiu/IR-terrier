	<brief_summary>As clinician , often struggle find effective pain control certain subgroup patient tetraplegia . These patient often severe upper back , neck , shoulder pain , limit rehabilitation productivity potential , always limit quality life . This pain appear primarily musculoskeletal . Muscles upper back neck become shorten , rock hard , extremely tender even slight touch stretch . Refractory multiple class medication , modality , treatment , patient truly suffer-not pain , fatigue , sedation , expense , loss useful rehabilitation time due attempt remedy . Unfortunately , subgroup patient small problem significant , anyone specializes treatment spinal cord injury patient recognize . In search another form treatment , botulinum toxin A ( BTXA ) may promise pain control group patient tetraplegia whose pain proven refractory treatment . It take long searching literature find compelling evidence BTXA may another mechanism action direct pain control , apart well know mechanism spasticity control . Clinically , increasingly recommend use purpose . In fact , one specific indication recognize BTXA treatment myogenic pain due short , tight , strain muscles-just see population . Yet , 's application study people tetraplegia . Thus , genesis project hope help patient evolve . Study hypotheses : - In addition traditional treatment use pain control , injection BTXA cervical upper back muscle effectively reduce cervical/shoulder pain severity report individual cervical spinal cord injury , regardless etiology pain . - Pain reduction secondary use BTXA associate decrease total analgesic medication use among SCI patient acute inpatient rehabilitation . - BTXA treat cervical/shoulder pain increase active participation rehabilitation program individual tetraplegia inpatient rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
