	<brief_summary>This study explore eat habit child determine eat behavior link genetics . Children 8 17 year age may eligible study . It include child experienced loss control eating , child report overeat without loss control , child report experience neither . Candidates screen follow : - Medical history brief physical examination , include height , weight , body fat measurement . Body fat measure use device call Bod Pod . The child sit inside device 5 minute machine determine body fat measure air movement . The child must wear tight-fitting swimsuit test . - Urine test look sugar protein urine test pregnancy female . - Blood test routine chemistry gene study relate eating behavior . - Questionnaires interview child 's general health eat habit . - Acclimatization test meal condition study . The child give yogurt shake drink fill rating scale drink . Participants come Clinical Center two time 8:30 a.m. laboratory meal test . At visit , child follow : - In morning , eat breakfast apple juice butter English muffin . - Between 10 a.m. 2 p.m. , pursue activity Clinical Center recreation facility NIH classroom , may eat drink anything contains calorie . - At 2 p.m. , fill rating scale hunger level . - At 2:30 p.m. , eat food buffet make available . - After eat , repeat rating scale hunger level . The procedure visit , except one visit child instruct eat much would eat normal meal , visit , instruction let go eat much want .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Little known eat habit child laboratory condition . In exploratory study , aim examine relationship measure food intake meal , binge eat behavior assess interview , polymorphisms gene believe involved regulation energy intake . We study child report experience loss control eating , child report overeat without loss control , child report neither episode , assess impact two different meal instruction eat behavior . We ask child eat meal laboratory set two occasion . The difference two meal pre-meal instruction : Participants ask either eat 'normally ' ( 'normal meal ' instruction ) 'let go ' ( 'binge meal ' instruction ) . Participants assess affective state ; degree hunger , fullness , desire binge ; presence overeating loss control ; eat attitude diet ; general school social adjustment . Participants ' DNA sequence seek polymorphism gene relevant appetite , leptin melanocortin 4 receptor gene , examine whether genetic variation leptin signal pathway account variation report actual eating behavior . Samples also obtain hormone believe relevant food intake . By accurately describe eat behavior child relation age , weight , history diet and/or overeat behavior , genetic variation , refine current theoretical model disorder eating .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Good general health . Age great 7 less 18 year . Participants must negative urine glucose normal electrolyte , hepatic , thyroid function refer treatment . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any major medical problem likely affect caloric intake ( e.g. , significant cardiac pulmonary disease likely result hypoxia decrease perfusion ) .
