	<criteria>A subject consider eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Life expectancy ≥16 week start lapatinib therapy ; Signed informed consent obtain patient ; Subjects must histologically confirm breast cancer advance ( Stage IIIb , IIIc T4 lesion ) metastatic disease ( include recurrent patient ) ; Subjects must meet follow criterion regard prior therapy : Anthracyclines , taxanes : If anthracycline taxanecontaining regimen administer sequentially ; Subjects provide least 2 cycle least 4 cycle total . If anthracycline taxanecontaining regimen administer concurrently ; Subjects provide least 4 cycle total . Subjects provide least 2 cycle total provide progressive disease occur . If anthracycline taxanecontaining regimen administer separately ; Subjects provide least 4 cycle . Subjects provide least 2 cycle provide progressive disease occur regimen . Trastuzumab : Prior treatment must contain trastuzumab alone combination chemotherapy least 6 week standard dos . Subjects must meet follow criterion regard ErbB2 expression ( define follow status undergo trastuzumab therapy . ) Patients ErbB2 overexpression : 3+ IHC , FISH+ 2+ IHC FISH+ also eligible . However , patient `` 2+ IHC '' previously treat trastuzumab undergo FISH study entry , test perform , consider eligible tumour categorise FISH+ . Documentation tumor progression relapse recent treatment require . Archived tumor tissue must available compare tumor response intratumoral expression level biomarkers ( ErbB1 ErbB2 ) . Measurable lesion ( ) accord RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) ; ( See `` 6.3 . Efficacy '' ) A female , ≥20 ≤74 year ( time give consent ) , eligible enter participate study : Nonchildbearing potential ( i.e. , woman function ovary current document tubal ligation hysterectomy , woman postmenopausal , i.e. , least 1 year past since last menstrual period ) ; The subject negative serum pregnancy test screening , agree one follow 2 week prior administration first dose lapatinib 28 day final dose lapatinib＊ . Complete abstinence intercourse : Consistent correct use one follow acceptable method birth control : Injectable progestogen ; Any intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; Oral contraceptive ( either combine Progestogen ) ; Barrier method include diaphragm condom spermicide . At least 3 week since last dose prior last chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , hormonal therapy , radiotherapy ( except local radiation therapy pain relief ) cancer since date completion surgery ( except minor surgical procedure ) begin treatment lapatinib , except trastuzumab must discontinue least 2 week prior begin study drug . Subjects must recover stabilize sufficiently side effect associate prior therapy ; Prior enrollment , radiation therapy allow limited field ( e.g . painful bone mets , painful lump ) , sole site measurable and/or assessable disease . Patients must complete treatment adequately recover , particular bone marrow suppression . Subjects bisphosphonate therapy . Bisphosphonates initiate prior study medication allow ; however , initiation bisphosphonate follow first dose study medication allow . Prophylactic use bisphosphonates permit treatment osteoporosis . Subjects stable CNS metastasis ( asymptomatic systemic steroid anticonvulsant least 3 month ) also eligible ; ECOG Performance Status 0 2 ; Able swallow retain oral medication ; Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) , measure echocardiogram ( ECHO ) , institutional 's low limit normal ( LVEF ≥50 % case normal range LVEF provide institution ) . Subjects must adequate organ function define : Myelofunction : Neutrophil count ≥1500 /mm3 Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL ( least 2 week blood transfusion need ) Platelet count ≥100,000 /mm3 Hepatic function : Albumin ≤2.5 g/dL Total bilirubin ≤1.5xULN AST , ALT : ≤3xULN ( without liver metastasis ) , ≤5xULN ( document liver metastasis ) Renal function : Serum creatinine ≤1.5 mg/dL , creatinine clearance ≤40 mL/min ( calculate Cockcroft Gault Method ) Subjects visit hospital weekly ( ±3 day ) least first month start lapatinib therapy every 4 week ( ±1 week ) last assessment . A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Pregnant lactating female ; Malabsorption Syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . Subjects ulcerative colitis also exclude ; History malignancy . Subjects disease free 5 year , subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible ; Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation , serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety * [ * ≥Grade 3 ( accord NCICTCAE Version 3.0 ) , general rule ] ; Active uncontrolled infection ; Known history uncontrolled symptomatic angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure ; Known history clinical evidence leptomeningeal carcinomatosis ; Participated clinical study within past 28 day first dose lapatinib ; Prior therapy ErbB1inhibitor ( e.g. , gefinitib ) and/or ErbB2 inhibitor trastuzumab ; Has taken/received prohibit inhibitor ( include food ) CYP3A4 within 7 day prior first dose study medication taken/received prohibited inducer inducer ( include food ) CYP3A4 within 14 day prior first dose study medication ( Refer Appendix 7 ) . The subject know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate lapatinib excipients Patients ineligible participation study judgment investigator/sub investigator .</criteria>
