	<brief_title>Serotonin Transporter Concentrations Women With History Anorexia Nervosa</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) serious eat disorder associate substantial morbidity mortality . Despite dangerously underweight , people AN believe overweight , frequently exhibit symptom depression anxiety . Other symptom AN include follow : resistance maintain healthy body weight ; fear gain weight become overweight ; denial seriousness one 's current low body weight . Relapse rate AN extremely high . Serotonin neurotransmitter , chemical messenger , affect mood , impulse control , appetite . A serotonin transporter specialize protein allow cell communicate use serotonin . Disturbances serotonergic system , network nerve cell use serotonin neurotransmitter , may contribute behavior characteristic AN . This study compare woman history AN maintaining normal weight healthy woman normal weight term concentration serotonin transporter brain . Participants observational study undergo one positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan one magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . Both used measure concentration serotonin transporter . A radioactive tracer use PET scan , administered via intravenous catheter line . No treatment provide study .</detailed_description>
