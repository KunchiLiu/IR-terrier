	<brief_summary>Individuals undergo spine surgery often significant loss blood may require multiple blood transfusion . Research show epsilon-aminocaproic acid ( EACA ) may reduce amount blood lose surgery , would decrease number blood transfusion require . This study evaluate safety effectiveness EACA reduce blood loss need blood transfusion individual undergo spine surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Epsilon-Aminocaproaic Acid Reduce Need Blood Transfusions During Following Spine Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spine surgery often require correct number disease , include spondylosis , pseudoarthrosis , scoliosis , spinal deformity . Spine surgery often associate significant blood loss individual may require multiple blood transfusion follow surgery . Blood transfusion expensive carry increase risk health complication , include fever , allergic reaction , infection . Preliminary research show EACA may beneficial individual undergo spine surgery . In addition , EACA appear safe less expensive medication typically use treat serious bleeding . The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness EACA reduce number blood transfusion require follow spine surgery adults . This study enroll individual undergo spine surgery Johns Hopkins Hospital . Prior surgery , participant ' demographic data medical history collect . Participants randomly assign receive either EACA placebo intravenously surgery 8 hour follow surgery intensive care unit ( ICU ) . While hospital , participant blood draw frequently laboratory test . They receive blood transfusion need closely monitored blood loss medical , surgical , transfusion complication . Outcome measurement related amount transfuse blood require postoperative complication collect 8th day follow surgery . Study participation end day hospital discharge day necessary second surgery .</detailed_description>
