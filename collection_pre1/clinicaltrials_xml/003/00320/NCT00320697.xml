	<detailed_description>Background Preliminary Data : Between 72 % 90 % patient schizophrenia smoke cigarette , schizophrenia patient likely general population smoke smoke heavily ( 1-6 ) . Compared general population , patient schizophrenia low smoking cessation rate , even highly motivated persistent attempt quit smoking ( 7-10 ) tolerate short-term tobacco abstinence without significant exacerbation clinical cognitive symptom ( 11 , 12 ) . Nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) bupropion well tolerated patient schizophrenia , bupropion superior placebo smoke cessation population add CBT ( 13-20 ) . However , abstinence rate low ( 4-19 % ) 3-6 month follow , whereas placebo plus CBT produce cessation rate 0-6 % . It estimate 45 % cigarette sell US sell people mental illness ( 21 ) UK Ireland , patient schizophrenia spend approximately one third weekly income cigarette ( 22 , 23 ) . Age-adjusted mortality smoking-related disease pulmonary cardiovascular disease two six time higher among people schizophrenia compare age match sample ( 24-27 ) . More effective pharmacologic treatment smoke cessation patient schizophrenia thus urgently need . Combination treatment bupropion NRT show promise . In large study non-psychiatric population , combination bupropion SR NRT superior placebo NRT alone bupropion alone smoke cessation ( 28 ) . In open , non-randomized smoking cessation study 115 nicotine dependent patient co-morbid psychiatric substance use disorder , patient treat bupropion SR plus NRT weekly CBT significantly great reduction smoke bupropion SR plus CBT , NRT plus CBT CBT alone ( 29 ) . Subjects combination bupropion SR plus NRT also significantly great retention smoke cessation program tolerate combination treatment well . These finding extend patient schizophrenia 12-week , randomize , double-blind trial bupropion placebo add NRT + CBT ( 30 ) . In trial , bupropion 300 mg/d identical placebo add NRT CBT 12 week . NRT give , start quit date week 4 , nicotine patch 21 mg/d 4 week , 14 mg/d 2 week 7 mg/d 2 week combine nicotine gum 18 mg per day prn . Combination treatment bupropion NRT well tolerate beneficial NRT alone significant smoke reduction patient schizophrenia ( Table 1 &amp; Figure 1 ) . The combination treatment also superior continuous abstinence week 8 dose NRT reduce . When subject take bupropion 300 mg per day , nicotine patch 21 mg per day prn nicotine gum 18 mg per day , cessation rate 52 % . See Table 1 . Patients begin relapse smoking dose nicotine patch reduce 14 mg per day continue relapse 12 month follow . It hypothesis 8-12 week treatment model traditionally use smoking cessation treatment adequate duration patient schizophrenia . In trial bupropion combine NRT , subject experienced 30 % relapse rate taper NRT patch 21 mg/day 7 mg/day still bupropion . In patient able achieve abstinence short-term treatment , trial long duration treatment bupropion + combination NRT dose use quit smoking warrant . It hypothesis rate relapse smoke low long duration pharmacologic treatment use quit smoking . Longer duration treatment justified patient schizophrenia several reason . First , schizophrenia patient know abnormality nicotinic receptor expression function may benefit general population continue pharmacotherapy maintenance abstinence ( 32-34 ) . Nicotinic receptor reduce number patient schizophrenia ( 32 , 35 ) heavy smoke schizophrenia may attributable attempt overcome deficit nicotinic activity . Benefits nicotine patient schizophrenia include reversal specific cognitive deficit associate schizophrenia antipsychotic medication ( 36-40 ) . Nicotine show improve learning , visual spatial work memory , attention , auditory sensory gate smooth pursuit eye movement reaction time ( 41 , 42 ) . The positive effect chronic nicotine treatment appear persist time , study , improvement cognition chronic nicotine treatment become robust time ( 43 ) . Secondly , burden morbidity mortality smoking related illness high schizophrenia warrant harm reduction approach . Continued NRT may consider harm reduction approach associate long term tobacco abstinence . For schizophrenia patient heavily addict tobacco product would like try quit smoking , may appropriate test whether high abstinence rate sustain longer-term treatment bupropion NRT , combine behavioral intervention . This study seek determine continue treatment bupropion NRT reduce relapse rate patient schizophrenia . Study Design : We propose study determine continue treatment bupropion NRT reduce smoke relapse rate schizophrenia . This study design 3 phase : initial open , 8 week smoking cessation phase , follow 44 week , randomize , placebo control , relapse prevention phase 3 month follow-up phase . One hundred thirty adult diagnosis schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder enter 8-week open smoke cessation trial . Subjects receive weekly cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , bupropion 300 mg/d nicotine patch 21mg/day 20 mg/day either nicotine gum lozenge prn use . Those attain abstinence agree participate relapse prevention phase ( n=60-70 ) , randomize , accord double-blind , parallel group design , receive continue treatment 21 mg nicotine patch bupropion SR 300 mg placebo add CBT 44 week . Adverse event document visit . Study medication distribute bi-weekly double blind phase . Study Procedures : Baseline Measures Screening : 1. Review medical chart confirm DSMIV diagnosis schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder medication 2 . Demographic Questionnaire 3 . Clinical Rating Scales : SANS ( Schedule assessment Negative symptom ) , BPRS ( Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ) , Hamilton Calgary depression scale , AIMS ( Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ) , SAS ( Simpson Angus Scale ) , BAS ( Barnes Akathisia Scale ) , Tiffany Questionnaire Smoking Urges , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory , Snaith Hamilton Anhedonia scale , Barrett Impulsiveness Scale , SF-12 smoke Self Efficacy Questionnaire Wisconsin Smoking Withdrawal Scale . 4 . Drug , alcohol smoke history include Fagerstrom Test Nicotine Dependence . 5 . Cognitive test include AX-Continuous Performance Test , WMS-III spatial span , Brief visuospatial memory test , Emotional Stroop , finger tapping , signal detection ( reward responsivity ) WTAR IQ.6 . Measure reward responsivity use signal detection test7 . Expired air CO , Salivary Cotinine 8 . Weight , height , pulse , blood pressure , UKU self-report adverse event form . 9 . Salivary Drug test exclude current abuse PCP , cannabis , alcohol , cocaine , methamphetamine opiate . 10 . Phlebotomy measure metabolic health , cotinine , bupropion medication level , gene nicotine metabolism , gene associate smoke cessation nicotine dependence . Additional serum store . If significant effect continue treatment smoking relapse , serum test comparison lipid inflammatory biomarkers group . 1 . Open Phase : All enrolled subject receive weekly CBT group session , bupropion 300 mg/ daily , nicotine patch 21 mg/day , 20 mg/day nicotine gum , lozenge , nasal spray prn use . Subjects set quit date group sessions 3 4 . The open phase group consist 8 weekly CBT meeting 10 participant . Subjects achieve 2 week continuous abstinence end open intervention eligible double blind , relapse prevention trial . 2 . Relapse Prevention Phase : Subjects randomize receive either nicotine patch bupropion placebo patch pill add CBT 44 week . Randomization take place use computer-generated table random number . Visits take place bi-weekly first 4 visit monthly throughout relapse prevention phase CBT group treatment . Study medication distribute visit . Smoking status determine visit self-report expire air CO . Medication side effect also record visit . 3 . Follow- Phase : During medication taper medication discontinue , subject attend 4 follow visit next 3 month . Clinical status use rating scale evaluate visit 1 , 11 , 17 , 20 , 30 34 . Serum level psychiatric medication metabolic marker also monitor . Subjects pay $ 5 group meeting open relapse prevention phase . Subjects also pay additional $ 5 follow-up visit attend self-report $ 20 clinical cognitive assessment . Subjects complete visit 30 34 end study receive additional $ 50 bonus .
