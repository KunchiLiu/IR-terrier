	<detailed_description>Background : Seventy-four 92 % patient schizophrenia smoke cigarette compare 24 % adult US population 18 % adult Massachusetts ( 1-3 ) . Patients schizophrenia also smoke cigarette average per day ( 4 ) attain high serum level cotinine , primary metabolite nicotine , find attribute deep smoke inhalation ( 5 ) . Cigarette smoke identify single important source preventable morbidity premature mortality general U.S. population last 29 year ( 6 , 7 ) . Compounded problem patient schizophrenia live less healthy lifestyle ( 8 ) may less likely receive adequate routine preventative medical care ( 9-12 ) , heavy smoking represent significant neglect public health problem people schizophrenia . Patients schizophrenia clearly great morbidity early mortality 'natural cause ' people without schizophrenia ( 13-22 ) likely die prematurely cardiovascular pulmonary disease ( 14 , 19 , 23-26 ) . Women schizophrenia show increased risk premature death cancer ( 24 ) previous study show low mortality cancer patient schizophrenia compare general population confirm ( 14 , 27 , 28 ) . Successful smoke cessation program patient schizophrenia could reduce increase medical morbidity mortality . A recent report pattern nicotine use cohort 50 patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder underscore point : cohort mean age 47 year mean age onset daily smoke 20 year ; 45.8 % report currently smoke relate health problem ; 95.8 % try unsuccessfully cut smoking ; 70 % make serious attempt quit smoking ( 29 ) . Smoking cessation program patient schizophrenia report compliance rate high 80 % ( 30 ) . Nicotinic receptor show reduced number patient schizophrenia ( 31 , 32 ) heavy smoke schizophrenia may attributable attempt overcome deficit . Benefits nicotine patient schizophrenia include reversal specific cognitive deficit associate schizophrenia antipsychotic treatment [ ( 33-37 ) . Nicotine show improve learning , visual spatial work memory , attention , auditory sensory gate smooth pursuit eye movement reaction time ( 38 , 39 ) . The positive effect chronic nicotine treatment appear persist time , study , improvement cognition chronic nicotine treatment become robust time ( 40 ) . Smoking cessation patient schizophrenia associated increase positive symptom ( 30 ) . Treatment atypical antipsychotic may enhance effectiveness smoke cessation treatment ( 41-43 ) . The mechanism effect know may due decrease extrapyramidal side effect , improve efficacy negative symptom effect glutamatergic system . Combination NRT antidepressant medication show increase cessation rate monotherapy NRT ( 44 ) antidepressant medication alone ( 45 ) . Nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) powerful aid smoking cessation well establish efficacy ( 46-49 ) non-psychiatric patient propose potential tool increase smoke harm reduction person unable achieve smoke abstinence ( 50 ) . Smoking cessation outcomes patient schizophrenia use NRT extremely variable . Ziedonis colleague use range dos NRT administer patch , gum combination addition CBT 10 week 24 patient schizophrenia ( 51 ) . Twelve subject complete trial . The cessation rate 13 % 6 month ( 51 ) . In one study , atypical antipsychotic agent , combination nicotine transdermal patch , show significantly enhance rate smoking cessation ( 55.6 % atypical agent group versus 22.2 % typical group ) ( 41 ) . In study overall end treatment point prevalence smoke cessation rate 45 patient schizophrenia 35 % . In another study acute effect transdermal nicotine patch psychiatric patient , however , patient quit smoke acutely , heavy smoker reduce cigarette consumption ( 52 ) . Safety NRT patient schizophrenia evaluate small scale . One important trial examine effect 21 mg nicotine patch smoke behavior , nicotine level blood sign toxicity patient schizophrenia ( 53 ) . In crossover trial , 10 male veteran monitor wear nicotine v placebo patch . The nicotine patch condition associate increased nicotine level without sign toxicity decrease CO level 80 % patient . No trial report worsen psychiatric symptom NRT . Larger study NRT combine behavioral support need evaluate efficacy safety NRT schizophrenia . Treatment Component : Subjects outpatient clinically stable currently treatment schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . Subjects recruit referral case manager , residential treatment setting outpatient treater . Subjects must smoke =1/2 pack per day cigarette wish quit smoking . Subjects randomly assign receive cognitive behavioral smoking cessation therapy CBT ) nicotine patch ( NRT ) plus placebo nicotine patch combine bupropion SR . Subjects unable tolerate contraindication treatment zyban may enrol receive CBT open label NRT alone . All subject receive 12 session group cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) program design smoke cessation treatment patient schizophrenia addition pharmacologic treatment . Evaluation Component : The evaluation component protocol involve monitor patient stability psychiatric symptom , serum level psychiatric medication , medication side effect baseline week 4 , 8 , 12 14 degree smoke reduction cessation weekly treatment intervention 6 , 12 24 month . At baseline , subject complete demographic questionnaire . Prior begin treatment , subject evaluate symptoms psychosis , depression , anxiety , medication side effect standard clinical rating scale include schedule assessment negative symptom ( SANS ) , positive negative symptom scale ( PANSS ) , Hamilton depression scale ( HamD ) , Hamilton anxiety scale ( HamA ) , abnormal involuntary movement scale ( AIMS ) , Simpson Angus Scale , SAFTEE . A brief cognitive battery include test response inhibition ( single trial Stroop ) , vigilance ( continuous performance test ) , verbal fluency ( FAS ) , verbal memory ( California Verbal Learning Test ) , work memory ( letter number span ) , non-verbal memory ( Benton visual retention test ) , psychomotor ability ( groove peg board task ) , executive functioning ( trail make tower London ) . Baseline carbon monoxide ( CO ) measurement use self report verify number cigarette smoke per day . Serum drawn cotinine antipsychotic level baseline . Weight check baseline , 12 24 week . Subjects set quit date week 3 4 . The evaluation battery repeat week 4 follow quit date . It also repeat week 12 patient discontinue group medication treatment . An evaluation include clinical battery CO measurement perform week 14 , two week follow termination smoke cessation treatment week 24 . Subjects also contact 1 2 year follow self report tobacco use CO measurement . Specific Aims : Treatment 1 . Increase availability nicotine replacement therapy , currently available prescription , patient major mental illness . 2 . Train staff member expertise treat patient major mental illness Tobacco Treatment Specialists use train protocol develop University Massachusetts Medical School collaboration Massachusetts Department Public Health . 3 . Establish network center able deliver tobacco treatment patient major mental illness . Specific Aims : Evaluation 1 . Evaluate smoking cessation rate , smoke reduction rate stability psychiatric symptom patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder smoking cessation attempt use cognitive behavioral therapy combine NRT plus placebo NRT + bupropion SR. 2 . Evaluate safety nicotine replacement therapy patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder combine antipsychotic medication . 3 . Evaluate safety nicotine replacement therapy patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder combine bupropion SR antipsychotic medication . Hypotheses : 1 . Nicotine replacement therapy combine bupropion SR cognitive behavioral therapy associate improvement smoke cessation smoking reduction rate compare NRT alone add CBT patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . 2 . Nicotine replacement therapy combine bupropion SR associate improvement negative symptom , depression impulsivity compare NRT alone patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder quit smoking . 3 . Concurrent treatment atypical antipsychotic medication enhance effectiveness NRT combine bupropion SR NRT plus placebo smoking cessation reduction patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder compare concurrent treatment conventional antipsychotic . 4 . Patients low baseline cotinine = 250 ng/ml high cessation rate patient high baseline cotinine &gt; 250 ng/ml .</detailed_description>
