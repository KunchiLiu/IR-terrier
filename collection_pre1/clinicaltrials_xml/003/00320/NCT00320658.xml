	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response Malaria Vaccine ( MSP1 42-C1 ) With Without CPG 7909 Adjuvant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2002 , World Health Organization report worldwide malaria incidence approximately 300 million clinical case annually , approximately 1 million death attribute malaria alone combination disease . The parasite Plasmodium falciparum responsible majority infection death . During P. falciparum infection , liver cell invade parasite asexual multiplication occur . The liver cell burst , ten thousand infectious particle call merozoite release . A multiprotein complex surface merozoite necessary merozoite infect blood cell . MSP1 42-C1 malaria vaccine mimic MSP1 42 , protein multiprotein complex . By introduce `` decoy '' form MSP1 42 , infection additional blood cell may block . The adjuvant CPG 7909 know elicit cell-mediated immunity , arm immune system defend body intracellular pathogen P. falciparum . This study evaluate safety immunogenicity MSP1 42-C1/Alhydrogel two different dos healthy adult . The vaccine give either alone CPG 7909 . This study last least 34 week . Participants randomly assign one four group : - Group A participant receive three injection low dose MSP1 42-C1/Alhydrogel . - Group B participant receive three injection low dose MSP1 42-C1/Alhydrogel CPG 7909 . - Group C participant receive three injection higher dose MSP1 42-C1/Alhydrogel . - Group D participant receive three injection higher dose MSP1 42-C1/Alhydrogel CPG 7909 . Enrollment Groups C D begin safety review participant Groups A B . All participant receive assign injection study entry , Week 4 , Week 8 , ask return clinic day vaccination clinical evaluation . Participants ask keep diary 6 day vaccination , take note body temperature side effect experience . There total 18 study visit 34 week . A clinical evaluation occur visit . Blood collection , vital sign measurement , urine collection occur select visit .</detailed_description>
