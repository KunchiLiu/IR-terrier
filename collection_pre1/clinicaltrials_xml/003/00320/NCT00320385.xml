	<criteria>Signed informed consent . Female ≥18 year . Women childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test screening must use approved contraceptive method , appropriate ( example , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , birth control pill , barrier device ) begin 2 week first dose investigational product 28 day final dose investigational product . Metastatic breast cancer , histologically/cytologically confirm . If disease restrict solitary lesion , neoplastic nature must confirm cytology histology . Subjects must stage IV breast cancer whereby disease progress either adjuvant metastatic setting . Prior therapy must include , limited : Taxanecontaining regimen least 4 cycle , 2 cycle provide disease progression occur taxane . Anthracyclinecontaining regimen least 4 cycle , 2 cycle provide disease progression occur anthracycline . Subjects must document progression follow least ONE trastuzumab plus cytotoxic chemotherapy antihormonal regimen metastatic setting . Note : The recent treatment must contain trastuzumab , either alone combination therapy metastatic setting , subject must progress regimen . Progression define either new lesion ≥20 % increase sum long diameter ( LD ) progression radiologic scan . Subjects must archive tumor tissue available testing . Documented amplification ErbB2 gene fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) document overexpression ErbB2 protein IHC primary metastatic tumor tissue . The IHC FISH amplification may document local central laboratory randomization study . Subjects may randomize basis ErbB2 positivity IHC 3+ overexpression FISH amplification . Lesion eligibility follow : least one measurable lesion ( ) accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ; Therasse , 2000 ] , boneonly disease . Note : Tumor lesion situate previously irradiate field , welldefined margin locate soft tissue define measurable disease . Subjects stable CNS metastasis define asymptomatic systemic steroid anticonvulsant least 1 month . Treatment prophylactic anticonvulsant permit , unless list within Prohibited Medications ( Section 8.2 ) . Radiotherapy receive within 2 week prior initiation investigational product limited area ( e.g. , palliative treatment painful disease ) sole site measurable disease allow ; however , subject must complete treatment recover treatmentrelated toxicity prior administration first dose investigational product . With single exception prior trastuzumab treatment , prior chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , surgery ( except minor surgical procedure ) must discontinue least 3 week prior first dose investigational product . Subjects must recover stabilize sufficiently treatmentrelated toxicity prior administration first dose investigational product . Bisphosphonate therapy bone metastases allow ; however , treatment must initiate prior first dose investigational product . Prophylactic use bisphosphonates permit treatment osteoporosis . ECOG Performance Status 0 2 . Able swallow retain oral medication . Cardiac ejection fraction within institutional range normal measure echocardiogram . MUGA scan accept case echocardiogram perform inconclusive . Same modality use baseline must use repeat assessment throughout study . Subject must adequate organ function define Table 1 : Table 1 ( Definitions Adequate Hematologic Hepatic Function ) SYSTEM ( LABORATORY VALUES ) Hematologic : ANC ( absolute neutrophil count ) ( ≥ 1x10^9/ L ) Hemoglobin ( ≥ 9 g / dL ) Platelets ( ≥75x10^9/ L ) Hepatic Albumin ( ≥ 2.5 g / dL ) Serum bilirubin ( ≤ 2 mg / dL ) AST ALT ( ≤ 3 x ULN without liver metastasis ) ( ≤ 5 xULN document liver metastasis ) Renal Serum Creatinine ( ≤1.5 mg / dL ) OR Calculated Creatinine Clearance1 ( ≥40 mL / min ) Calculated Cockcroft Gault Method . Subjects may continue antiestrogen therapy treatment initiate least 1 month prior first dose investigational product ( IP ) . After randomization , antihormonal therapy may initiate . Pregnant lactating female . Prior therapy ErbB1 and/or ErbB2 inhibitor trastuzumab . Malabsorption syndrome , disease significantly affect gastrointestinal function , resection stomach small bowel . Subjects ulcerative colitis also exclude . History malignancy . However , subject diseasefree 5 year , subject history completely resect nonmelanoma skin cancer successfully treat situ carcinoma eligible . Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety . Unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug and/or prior cancer treatment . Active uncontrolled infection . Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent . Known history uncontrolled symptomatic angina , arrhythmia , congestive heart failure . Known history clinical evidence leptomeningeal carcinomatosis . Concurrent cancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy ) . Concurrent treatment investigational agent participation another clinical trial . Used investigational drug within 3 week 5 halflives , whichever longer , precede first dose investigational product . Known immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy drug chemically relate trastuzumab lapatinib excipients . Have current active hepatic biliary disease ( exception patient Gilbert 's syndrome , asymptomatic gallstone , liver metastasis stable chronic liver disease per investigator assessment ) .</criteria>
