	<detailed_description>This protocol design gather small amount blood patient see New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center Pulmonary , Critical Care unit , 5 West floor ( Pulmonary Floor ) clinical care associate chronic lung disease . This protocol also survey medical record patient chronic lung disease , order study clinical characteristic individual . Investigators aim understand genetics chronic lung disease , use serum DNA blood perform various genotyping study genomic/gene expression study individual chronic lung disease . General admission criterion project require least one following : ( 1 ) symptom consistent pulmonary disease ; ( 2 ) chest X-ray consistent lung disease ; ( 3 ) pulmonary function test consistent lung disease ; ( 4 ) lung biopsy consistent lung disease ; ( 5 ) family history lung disease ; ( 6 ) patient disease organ know association lung disease . The following study conduct blood specimen : genomic DNA extract ; promoter sequence antioxidant-related gene obtain PCR sequence . The goal find single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) see correlate lung disease . DNA sample blood specimen cod . Samples could potentially trace back patient . However , every effort make keep patient 's identity confidential per HIPAA regulation . The study aim create blood bank . Rather , blood sample use DNA extraction . Serum store future study , look level protein .</detailed_description>
