	<brief_summary>Diabetic nephropathy frequent microvascular complication occur approximately 40 % patient either type 1 type 2 diabetes . The common cause end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) United States develop world diabetic nephropathy . Currently , half United States ESRD population diabetes . More effective therapy prevent treat diabetic nephropathy urgently need . One way increase therapeutic effectiveness refine treatment target base improved understanding treatment modulate disease process . The purpose study determine whether treatment diabetic nephropathy , angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan , modify mediator kidney injury independent blood pressure relationships drug dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transforming growth factor-beta 1 ( TGF-beta 1 ) potent inducer extracellular matrix production fibrogenesis associate occurrence diabetic micro- macrovascular complication . Several vitro vivo study implicate TGF-beta 1 pathogenesis diabetic kidney disease . Recent animal vitro experiment demonstrate ACE inhibitor Angiotensin II ( AT-II ) receptor antagonist , include candesartan , decrease synthesis secretion renal TGF-beta 1 prevent development glomerulosclerosis , interstitial fibrosis , progressive renal dysfunction . These protective effect appear unrelated antihypertensive effect agent . Limited data human support finding patient diabetic nephropathy . A recent human study AT-II receptor antagonist losartan demonstrate ability correct microalbuminuria independent blood pressure control correlate normalization circulate level TGF-beta 1 . The result support observation marker collagen type 1 metabolism normalize hypertensives TGF-beta 1 normalized treatment remain unaltered remain hypertensive despite blood pressure control . Such finding consistent recent observation AT-II receptor antagonist irbesartan renoprotective independently blood pressure-lowering effect patient type 2 diabetes microalbuminuria . The use ACE-inhibitors AT-II receptor antagonist mean reduce progression renal fibrosis become increasingly widespread . Dosage recommendation achieve goal unclear prompting expert ask whether TGF-beta 1 rather blood pressure therapeutic target . Although verified chronic condition , previous short-term study AT-II antagonist candesartan demonstrate different dose-response relationship exist blood pressure , renal plasma flow , plasma renin activity . It likely dose-response relationship difference also exist aforementioned parameter ( particularly blood pressure ) TGF-beta 1 . In type 1 diabetic patient treat captopril relationship demonstrate percent change plasma TGF-beta 1 percent decline GFR . In another study 21 patient baseline GFR &lt; 75 ml/min strike correlation captopril-induced reduction serum TGF-beta 1 2-year change GFR ( r = -0.73 , p =0.0001 ) . This latter observation particularly important demonstrate relationship TGF-beta 1 rate decline kidney function modify pharmacologic intervention . The dosage range candesartan accord FDA approve package insert 4 32 mg daily , adjust base blood pressure response . Whether dose effectively lower blood pressure sufficient suppress urinary TGF-beta 1 concentration unknown . In absence data , many expert already suggest dos higher need control hypertension . Including maximum dose candesartan 64 mg dose titration scheme important help resolve issue . Furthermore , unclear candesartan dose/concentration - effect relationship TGF-beta 1 blood pressure dissimilar . Information regard relationship candesartan dose effect urinary TGF-beta 1 concentration patient diabetic nephropathy would valuable tailor therapy enhance understand optimal use agent modulate renin-angiotensin system . Recent data experimental model diabetes indicate renin angiotensin system interact advanced glycation end product ( AGEs ) produce kidney damage diabetes . ACE inhibition diabetic rat reduce circulate renal accumulation AGEs , possibly increase expression soluble receptor AGEs . In rat model normoglycemia AGE infusion , increase kidney expression renin angiotensin system component along structural change similar diabetic model observe . Renin angiotensin system activation kidney structural change reverse valsartan . Therefore , modulation AGEs may also important mechanism kidney protection renin angiotensin system inhibition diabetes . This hypothesis unexplored human . An exploratory sub-study ass whether candesartan reduces urinary excretion carboxymethyllysine , prominent AGE , patient diabetic nephropathy . Study Objectives Hypotheses : The overall objective study provide information improve kidney health patient diabetes . In population patient type 2 diabetes , nephropathy , hypertension follow hypothesis test : 1 . Changes parameter blood pressure , urinary TGF-beta 1 , serum AT-II , urinary albumin demonstrate correlation change chronic candesartan dose serum concentration . 2 . The candesartan dose concentration response curve BP urinary TGF-beta 1 significantly different predictive one another . 3 . Candesartan treatment reduce urinary excretion carboxymethyllysine .</detailed_description>
